National Treasure: Book of Secrets," It Had A Lot To Live Up To...
","So, not such a great sequel. It did have a lot to live up to. And though it's not too dead it definitely doesn't have as much life or action as the original.This could be down to the change in the writers, with only the Wibberleys staying on from the original. However, even the direction doesn't quite hit the right spots.Even though the story has Ben Gates, Cage, in more personal dilemmas than the first story, I just couldn't get behind the tale or the character this time. Time has ticked by and the future has seen some changes in Gates' life. His sidekick Riley, Bartha, is living the good life on his one per cent. He has broken up with Abigail, Kruger, and she is now seeing new people. Then evidence comes to light asserting that one of his ancestors killed Abraham Lincoln. So he resolves to get the gang back together and solve this new mystery.Unfortunately, the story isn't as well thought through and comes across a tad humdrum. Another undoing was the characters. These are not as distinct and complete as they were. The interactions between them appear forced, at times, and a little insipid. They feel as though they're there to move the story forward and not to add substance to the film. Even though the story calls for Ben and Abigail to rekindle their affections, their obvious chemistry from the first film is gone. Most of the time, there is an awkwardness between the two. In truth, all the wonderful transactions between the characters have taken a critical hit. Only Ben and his dad Patrick, Jon Voight, still have a semblance of the relationship they shared in the first story.This leaves it up to Jon Turtletaub to save the film. This he does, though he doesn't reach the heights of the original. His main impediment is the end action sequence. Up to this point, there's been very little action. Then when we get to the great finale it's not that great. It's too crowded and frantic making it difficult to completely follow what's happening. This makes it less exciting to watch. Then when they get to the tipping balance you begin to think, WTF! It smacks of the writers and the director trying too hard to be cool.The cast, as in the original, do a pretty decent job with the story and direction they are given. That is, except for Ed Harris. I have never been a big Ed Harris fan and this film shows why perfectly. A bad guy needs a persona, something the audience can boo or at least feel some satisfaction when they lose. Mitch Wilkinson has no persona whatsoever. In fact, the guy is so dull and tedious that when he makes his first appearance at Gates' presentation I'm amazed anybody notices him. He has the 'Wha... wha... wha...' of Charlie Brown's teacher. This character needed an actor with screen presence.Because the original film is so good I would not recommend you watch this film. It will be a letdown. Instead, do yourself a favour and watch the original again. If you've not watched the original yet then forget this one and get a copy of the first film, sit back, and enjoy that one.Feel free to traverse over to my The Game Is Afoot and Holding Out For A Hero lists to see where I've charted this less than enthralling sequel. Who knows, your next favourite film may be awaiting you there.",6,0,0,6 March 2020
The Equalizer," The Old Man's Gotta Be The Old Man; The Fish Gotta Be The Fish...
","This is not the Robert McCall I grew up watching and that isn't a bad thing. I like the idea that writer Richard Wenk and director Antoine Fuqua reenvisioned the 1980's character for the modern era. As always Denzel Washington is superb and brings a new dimension to the character of The Equalizer.Robert McCall is a warehouse worker in a D I Y retail store who at work helps his fellow employees, though out of work he's a solitary character with a habitual routine that verges on obsessive compulsive disorder. Each night he goes to the same diner and sits at the same table and orders a cup of water, into which he drops a teabag. While there he reads a book, he's on number 97 of the top 100 books to read before you die. He has a conversational relationship with one of the prostitutes that use the diner as a way station. This relationship becomes stronger and when she comes in battered and bruised McCall takes it upon himself to help her out...From here on in you begin to learn of McCall's secret past as the action and violence amps up. McCall is a dark man who keeps his feelings in check though you never get to find out what makes him such a cold and logical executioner. This may be because there are more works in the pipeline, I hope so as this was an enjoyable movie.The only irksome element of the story and movie is the relationship between McCall and the prostitute Teri, played by Chloe Grace Moretz. As I previously stated, their relationship takes on an extra vitality. However, when she's hospitalised, he goes to the hospital though never makes contact and this is the last we see of her until the end; and this appears to have been an afterthought to give McCall a more humanistic presence. I think if the characters had more scenes together throughout the movie this could have help to detract from McCall's cold robotic personality. Maybe this wasn't the director's vision.There's nothing in this film that hasn't been covered in other movies but that doesn't stop this from being an entertaining 132 minutes; It kept my attention so well that it really doesn't seem that long a film.If you enjoyed the series, or like action films, or love Denzel Washington (or all three), then this film will be right up your street.",8,0,2,19 March 2017
Train to Busan," A Ferocious Bite Of Living Dead Excellency
","I had this movie sitting on my 'YouView' box for quite a few months, even though I had been originally excited that Film4 had decided to air this 'little' Korean gem of a horror movie. There had been rave reviews and more than a slight 'buzz' about the picture. The trouble with me is that I've been let down by hyped movies before - The Blair Witch Project, a major case by example. Another trouble is my own little foibles. I don't want to be reading subtitles when I'm tired (and I do so love to watch horror flicks after the sun has set with the lights low... or off!) and I cannot stand dubbed films (too many Jackie Chan movies in my youth...). So one night, not so very long ago I was feeling awake enough to read a movie so I hit play on 'Train To Busan'...By the time the end credits rolled I was amped up and wide awake. This is one hell of a rollercoaster ride of a movie and one hell of a tangle of modern-day lives story. This is not your basic Zombie flick.You start out really slowly and pretty sedated. A farmer is on his way to the market when his van is stopped by men in hazmat suits. These tell him that there's nothing to worry about. There has been a slight leak at a chemical plant. After quickly decontaminating his vehicle they send him on his way... unluckily for the dear he runs down and kills. More angry at damaging his van than killing a dear he drives away leaving the carcass in the road... yeah... you know what's going to happen. Sure enough, the dead animal thrashes about and shakily gets to its feet... with a dead look in its eyes...Even though this section only takes a few minutes it's one of the most superbly shot sequences I've seen in a movie. The director Yeon Sang Ho manipulates each set perfectly give the audience a creepily eerie atmosphere, which did start the shivers running up and down my spine. For that I thank them... it's been a long time since that's happened. There's nice steady sweeping camera pans. Effortlessly worked lighting. Superb control of sound... or lack of it. Even better is that all of this artwork and skill doesn't stop here it runs throughout the whole movie. It screams skill and class.Then the writers, Park Joo Suk and Yeon Sang Ho, get to work weaving together tales of modern-day living. The main characters are Seok-Woo (Gong Yoo) and his daughter Soo-Ann (Kim Su An). He is a busy, work-comes-first-to-support-family guy who was already lost his wife to divorce and is now bringing up Soo-Ann, with the help of his mother. Soo-Ann is a young child who doesn't understand or appreciate her father's outlook on life. All she knows is that she doesn't see either him or her mother as much as she wants or should. She wants more time with both of her parents. So, on her birthday, after her dad buys her a repeat present (who doesn't need two Nintendo Wii's(?)) she gets him to promise to take her to see her mum for her real present. As is the usual case it's Su-An Kim's performance that steals the show - and this is as it should be.This then brings them into contact with Sang-Hwa (Ma Dong Seok) and his very expectant wife Seong-Kyeong (Jung Yu Mi). Sang-Hwa and Seok-Woo do not get on at all and it's this juxtaposition in ideals and prerogatives that add more depth to the story; especially when they have to work together to survive the train ride. It's Seong-Kyeong that provides the glue to their relationship.Add to this a mysterious homeless man (Choi Gwi Hwa), a couple of romantic teens getting to grips with their feelings towards each other - Yong-Guk (Choi Woo Sic) and Jin-Hee (Sohee), and officious self-centred train manager Yon-Suk (Kim Eui Sung), you have a set of characters which can create some volatile or sentimental storylines... and this is before we get to the best Zombies... EVER!One of my favourite zombie flicks is Return Of The Living Dead. Two of the reasons were the zombies - they were dead and very icky (most were skinless)... and they were fast. The brain-eating buggers didn't shamble after you. And you have the same here. Though these dead aren't so skinless they are damned fast and furious.This adds to some pretty spectacular action scenes in the movie which Yuen Sang Ho directs magnificently. But, whereas, most directors would opt for action over horror and story Yuen is proficient in all styles. The scenes where the dead reanimate are both startling, invigorating, eerie, and full of style and strength.This is a tour-de-force of filmmaking, let alone horror filmmaking. Everything in this movie is excellent, from the story to the acting to the directing.",10,1,5,21 September 2018
The Babadook," Don't Believe The Hype
","This is one of those films where you shouldn't believe the hype. After all I'd heard and read about this movie I was really looking forward to it. However, while viewing I soon became aware this was not going to live up to its publicity... and it didn't... it fell woefully short.Here you have a story of a single widowed mother and her peculiar son who are going through life in a stagnant haze. Her son, Samuel (played by Noah Wiseman) is an intelligent child who has a knack for constructing weapons, for which he is reprimanded at school. Samuel is a solitary child who finds it hard to make friends and keep them. He also has a temper that makes him violent, both physically and vocally, when he's confronted.Samuels mother, Amelia (played by Essie Davis) works at a care home and dealing with the close to death cronies has its effect on her. She holds onto the memories of her seven-year dead husband, Oskar, in a proverbial death grip, even her own sister has given up on her. Amelia won't let Samuel have his birthday on the date of his birth as Oskar died driving her to the hospital.Even before the Babadook rears its head, the family is troubled and broken. This should lead to well-rounded and deep characterisations. Instead of this, we get depressed and moody bad parenting from Amelia and shouty stomping belligerence from Samuel. This makes for two very unlikeable characters. If the viewer cannot sympathise, empathise, or in some little way, relate to the main characters then the story and film will not hold their attention... it failed to hold mine... and to be bluntly truthful, I was only watching in the hopes that the Babadook had its evil way with them... I was upset when it didn't.These two characters are both worse than the snot filled blubbering idiot in The Blair Witch Project.The there's the story, which in my eyes, tries to say and be too much. It's not sure if it's horror, there are elements of horror in here, though too little for me to put it in the genre. There's drama with all the elements of relationships in tribulation. The film would've been a lot better if some of these elements had been trimmed back and some removed altogether, and the director chose a direction in which to take the film.So that's what's wrong with the film in my opinion.So what was right?The acting from Essie Davis was pretty good especially, later in the film, when her temperament instantly changes. This sent a chill up and down my spine. Noah Wiseman was brilliant in the son's role. I cannot fault the actors, the fault lies with story and direction, which falls on the head of Jennifer Kent who wrote and directed.That said, apart from the direction of the characters and the story the film was well directed, and at times gave a few chills with prolonged shots of opened wardrobes and corners of rooms, where clothes were hung; the tension created was palpable. So we know that she can direct. Maybe she should've given the story synopsis, which was brilliant and well thought out, over to a writer! I say this as the ending of this movie is why I've placed this into a Dark Fantasy, that and the reason of the Babadook ending up being wimpy (sorry for the spoiler) - this was the biggest let-down of all... a horror movie that tells you there's really nothing to be scared of.I wouldn't recommend anybody watching this film; there's nothing to get out of it. By the end, I was disheartened.",3,0,3,23 February 2017
Ant-Man," Marvel's Best Movie To Date - A Miniature Marvel
","After watching Marvel's Avengers - Age Of Ultron and Guardians Of The Galaxy, of which I was a little less than bowled over by, I was hesitant to watch this film. I knew this had the potential to be a brilliantly visual masterpiece - which it was. It was also a well thought out story filled with interesting characters and well-shot scenes, both innovative and ingenious.Marvel needed this film to breathe fresh air into its universe.Though it's not the Hank Pym Ant-Man that I remembered out of the back pages of the Hulk comic of my youth it still held up to the comic's feel and atmosphere.Writers, Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay, and Paul Rudd create a good and solid story around this Ant-Man's origin and the threat which the Ant-Man tech could produce. It could also be that the personality of Scott Lang (Ant-Man) is so steadfast and credible is that Paul Rudd who portrayed him also co-wrote the screenplay. I've never been a great fan of Rudd's as I've found his previous work could either hit (Role- Models) or miss (Admission) - this is definitely some of his better work, and he adds quite a bit to the character and atmosphere of the movie.Even the rest of the cast do a brilliant job with their characters. I especially liked Bobby Cannavale as Paxton, Scott's ex-wife's new man... and cop! He adds a nice dynamic to Scott's personal life as he loves Maggie and Cassie (Scott's ex and daughter) and tries to give Scott the benefit of the doubt, even though he's an ex-con. Then there's Michael Pena who is outstanding as Luis. It was nice to see Evangelina Lilly in a decent roll and she carried off the role of Pym's estranged daughter, Hope Van Dyne, admirably. She should make a brilliant Wasp in the upcoming sequel.The other star of this film is the Director, Peyton Reed, who seems to effortlessly weave CGI and reality together. The scenes where Scott pops from miniature to actual size while fighting could have been so bad but thanks to the direction and the animators they're believable and very effective. Reed is also good at switching pace to give his audience a roller-coaster ride of a movie.The special effects are superb and seamless - respect due to all involved. And it is truly wonderful that Thomas the Tank Engine is finally breaking into the big time.This film is a must for all comic book and action movie lovers alike. If you've not hopped into the Marvel universe yet this is one hell of a good place to start... though it may make the rest of the films look a little pale by comparison. This is one film I will watch again... and again...",9,0,1,29 May 2017
The Hills Have Eyes," Better Than The Original - Sorry Wes...
","There's not much difference between this remake and the 1977 original. A family of campers have decided to drive across America. Unfortunately for them, this includes the desert, wherein the 1950's the army carried out a series of nuclear tests. After stopping for gas, and inadvertently offending the station attendant, he tells the group of a shortcut through a valley in the hills... Just as it starts to dawn on them that the shortcut is turning out to be a long drive, their tyres blow out... This is a 50th wedding anniversary they'll remember until they die... which won't be long...This may sound disrespectful of Wes Craven, but the best thing about this film, by far, is the direction. Alexandre Aja, who had only previously directed the acclaimed, magnificent, and one of my favourite films, Haute Tension, does the story proud. His eye for panoramic shots and the ability to create an atmosphere of aloneness with them, and then his use of the nuclear-blasted 'Little America', complete with creepy mannequins, creates a really uneasy eeriness that's exactly what the story needed.Also opting to get rid of the dreadful electronic soundtrack was a bonus. This was a major hindrance to the original. Without it, the excitement is created in different ways; camera shots, angles, lighting, acting, and sound effects.The other nice thing was the cast... though a cameo by Michael Berryman wouldn't have gone amiss. There are a more than a few solid actors in the film. Ted Levine as Big Bob the ex-policeman and father of the group. He gives a solid reliable performance in a supporting role, though he's yet to come across a role as meaty as his Buffalo Bill Silence Of The Lambs character. His wife, Ethel, is played by the beautiful and talented Kathleen Quinlan. Though the stand out characters is Tom Bower as the gas station attendant, Robert Joy as Lizard - he really does appear to enjoy this role, Dan Byrd as Bobby, and Emilie De Ravin as Brenda.Also, the special effects have moved on a long way from 1977... instead of the bright red blood which flowed copiously back then, we have a more realistic crimson, which gets slashed, gouged, and blasted insanely all over the place. Not only do the hills have eyes, they also run red...This is how a remake should be made. It was brave of Aja not to change the story but to bring it up-to-date, not just in the story but also with the filming techniques. Aja, just adds his skill into the mix and the outcome is beautiful, brilliant, and spooky as hell enjoyment. Because of this, I would recommend every horror fan or wannabe to check this out rather than the original 1977 film.",8,0,1,27 April 2018
Divergent," Find Another Film To Watch
","I've not read the books but if the film is anything to go on I won't be rushing out to buy them anytime soon.I know this is a dystopian story set in the future but I can't class it as a Science Fiction movie as the entire story concept is implausible. I cannot believe the human race would reduce itself into five factions which are segregated by a test, but then they get to choose which faction they want to join. Not only are the factions designated by job, but by uniform, colour, and even their homes. They are not allowed any personal items as that might bring forth human nature. Imagine Humans being Human, what a notion!The acting is just okay, even the bigger name actors, Ashley Judd, Maggie Q, Ray Stephenson, and Kate Winslet couldn't lift this film out of the morass the story and direction placed it in.I don't know how they could've made the movie any better other than a total rewrite and refilm.However, the action sequences aren't too bad except for the fight training... doesn't anybody remember Martial Arts in this stupid, segregated, and insanely dull future world(?)I wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone. There are loads of better films out there, go watch Hercules starring Dwayne Johnson, so much more entertaining.",4,0,2,13 January 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," An ActionFest Flick - Shame The Story Wasn't As Good As The Stunts...
","This is an all-out actionfest. Right from the opening you've got Cruise (Ethan Hunt) holding onto the side of an aeroplane as it takes off - Bloody Nutter! This in most films would be the top stunt; this, of course, is MI so it's just your opening salvo of insaneness.It's the story which kinda lets it down. These have now become secondary to the stunts, which I have to say are superb - and not too much CGI (except for the tech stuff, that is). Here you have a secret organisation called The Syndicate (nope they don't rig the lottery). But as 'syndicate' describes a group working towards an aim, then the name is wrong as it turns out to be one man controlling his own mercenary army. I think there would have been great scope had it actually been a syndicate with many heads like the hydra.There are a couple of holes in the story though they are minor... except for the ending... just how did the bad guy NOT think the scenario would turn out this way. Bit of a let down as he'd been ahead of Hunt and his team all through the film. In fact, the way Lane (Sean Harris) manipulates people is pretty awesome and is a good plot builder and twist creator. It's this element that keeps the story interesting. But in the end, Hunt has to overcome... it's just a shame that the ending wasn't as twist orientated as the rest of the story.I cannot fault the direction or the pace of the film, as McQuarrie, gives the audience an atmospheric and excitement filled rollercoaster ride of a movie. He is great at filming the fight scenes and chases as well as the drama set-up acting scenes. For example the car and bike chase between Hunt and Ilsa Faust (Ferguson). When Hunt's car crashes he slows down the action to build tension... and then to build to a comical end to that scene, before revving up the torque to near maximum for the rest of the chase.In fact, it's Rebecca Ferguson (Faust) that adds Kudos to the cast. She gives a fantastic performance as a strong-minded and deadly woman who happens to be beautiful and sexy to boot. She even has an air of secrecy and mystery to her. You are never too sure about her or her motives. This in some way is told by the story but a lot of it comes from Ferguson's portrayal of Faust. This is one actress to watch. She and her character really made this film for me. It's nice to have a new strong character as we've gotten used to the others. And to be honest when I see Cruise, Penn, Rhames, Renner and Baldwin I actually see them and not their characters as throughout the years they've become partially stereotyped. Which is a shame as it's this that lets the film down slightly. At least in MI III, the writers tried to give Ethan Hunt a deeper character, one with issues and problems - shame they didn't progress down that line.I would happily recommend this to all lovers of Mission Impossible and action films alike. There's not much you have to do as a viewer except sit back and enjoy... hopefully you'll make it to the edge of your seat a couple of times.",8,0,1,30 January 2018
The Lego Movie," All Pretty Hype - No Substance.
","This is an atrociously boringly unfunny and predictable movie, though it's beautifully shot. All the faults lie with writers and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.The synopsis of the movie is pretty decent and should have resulted in a good movie. A regular Lego construction worker, Emmet, finds out that he's the master builder of an ancient prophecy that states he'll save the world from the craggle and Lord Business.Where the story falls short is the overused and clichéd jokes and characters and they were telegraphed so early you knew they were coming. For example, Emmet has only had one original design idea - a double- decker sofa; so when asked to build something when they are trying to escape from Bad-Cop and his minions, he builds (you guessed it) his double-decker sofa while everybody else builds the submarine; then when the sub is destroyed by Bad-Cop guess what survives... yep, you're right the sofa. I was groaning and shaking my head. All too predictable.Next major fault is the direction, there are lots of scenes that are dragged out too long, in particular, the scene where Bad-Cop / Good-Cop (which was a very inventive idea) is interrogating Emmet. Bad-Cop gets angry and goes mental and kicks a chair around the room. It's not that funny a scene and it becomes boring quite quickly as the directors stretch the sequence out and actually diminishes the scene.Another thing the films suffers with is the vocal talents. With the exception of Will Arnet as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle / Lucy, and Nick Offerman as Metal Beard, the rest of the voices just don't quite fit their character. I am not a big fan of Will Ferrell though I have to admit he's not too bad here as he reigns in some of his outlandishness. However, he should have been more intimidating, mean, and menacingly voiced for his character of Lord Business. I felt embarrassed for Morgan Freeman as he sounded tired, for the most part, in his rendition of Vitruvius. Then there was the grating and annoying tones of Unikitty, played by Amanda Brie, who had me reaching for the remote and the off button. I did like the way that they incorporated original voices into the cast as C3P0 was voiced by Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams voiced Lando - shame they couldn't do it with the rest of the 'Known' cast.The only good thing this film had going for it was the Lego itself and it's CGI generation. Had the rest of the film been as good these scenes it would have been a masterpiece of filmmaking. However special effects cannot carry a film alone.To be honest I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. There are a lot of much better kids films out there... So go treat yourself and watch one of them. I wouldn't even push this for the Batman element, even though he's one of the main good elements he's still not enough... and he even starts to wear thin as the movie progresses... I'm now a little worried for The Lego Batman Movie.",4,1,3,22 June 2017
Captain America: Civil War," The Best Avengers Movie... er, Captain America Movie To Date.
","Just when the Avengers stories were getting stale and very familiar, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely along with directors Anthony and Joe Russo bring us the best Avengers movie to date... except that it isn't since it's Capt's film.Let's get this out of the way, this is loosely based on Mark Millar's opus though it could never reach the depths of characterisation or story in just the two and half hour runtime. Though the story has been pared down to the minimum basics of the original, what we do get is very entertaining. After the disastrous effects of Age Of Ultron the governments of the world are wanting to put a leash on the Avengers and all other heroes. Not all of the heroes are accepting of this arrangement, especially Captain America who goes off on his own.The only thing I would have liked in this film is a deeper look at the psychological effects the Sokovia Sanctions, which are addressed in the graphic novels. This would have made it stronger and more accessible to adults. They could have done this without changing the certification.It was also nice to see the other newbies to the Marvel universe - Ant- Man, The Black Panther, and of course The Amazing Spiderman. It was great seeing Spidey finally mixing it up in the with The Avengers and with the changing eye lenses in his costume and the best and most accurate portrayal yet, from Tom Holland - Awesome. Though I'm not too sure about the upcoming Homecoming movie or the role Stark is to play in Peter Parkers costume. The star of this film though has to be The Black Panther - Chadwick Boseman gives a brilliantly cool portrayal of the hero prince of Wakanda.The rest of the cast give the performances we are used to from the rest of the series.Thanks to the directors, the action is fast and furious, and thanks to Spidey and Ant-Man pretty funny. The effects are superb, as always, and they don't overpower the story or the screen as with previous films - the fight scene on Ultron was too busy and confusing (and too short). The pace is varied and creates a roller-coaster ride of a film which helps keep the emotions of the viewers fluctuating between excitement and the dramatic. This is a well-constructed and crafted movie.For me, this third instalment of the Captain America series is the best; and as I stated at the start it's also the best Avengers movie too. If you've not started watching any of the Marvel Universe films yet then this is one to catch. It works as a stand-alone movie as it references the previous films in a way that you don't need to see them to know what's happening here. In regards to both Captain America and The Avengers, this is the only movie in each of the series which I will watch more than once, it is that enjoyable.",9,0,1,11 June 2017
It Follows," Good Premise - not fully utilised.
","The premise of this film is a good one - a person has sex and a supernatural spirit begins to follow them, with the intention of murdering them. The only way for that person to survive the entity is to have sex with someone and pass the 'curse' onto them. Should they die then the spirit reverts back to following the last person once again.Unfortunately, the premise is not fully utilised in the story, there are quite a few holes. The main hole in the story is the origin of the 'curse'; we are not told it is a curse, it may be something else; we are not told why the killings are happening; or how it all started. These things deter from the story because at the end of the movie these issues made me feel as though the story was incomplete and lacking.Had these issues been resolved it would have made the story and the movie a lot stronger, and possibly a lot darker and more haunting.Taking that into consideration, what you do get in this movie is a strange surreal feeling, this is due to the direction and the soundtrack. These are very reminiscent of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg. It's as though they had a baby and his name was David Robert Mitchell.The opening scene has John Carpenter's Halloween written all over it. The entire film took me back to my youth in the 80's and I loved it. Sometimes, though, the soundtrack was too jarring, as Cronenberg's electronic soundtrack was apt to be, though here it doesn't work as well.The acting is above average with the mostly unknown cast doing a pretty decent job of adding to the tension and atmosphere of the movie. Even though there's not much gore, it's the palpable tension and atmosphere which make this a spooky supernatural story.So if you like a slow burning taut eerie tale then this could be right up your street.",6,0,0,15 February 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," It's Okay, But It Is A Very Familiar Marvel Story Could Have Been Better.
","Another Marvel picture to expand their universe a little more. However, this didn't live up to the hype or the fanboy hysteria, well, not for me.I have to say though the special effects crew were running on all cylinders as the visuals are truly spectacular and as close to flawless as you could get. It was pretty difficult to see where the CGI kissed the reality. Much respect for the crew.Respect too to the Director James Gunn who did a splendid job keeping the action flying and the drama, what little there was, at a steady pace and flow.However, I would have liked the formula to be a little different as it ran straight in line with all the other Marvel films. As soon as they knew they had a winning formula with Avengers Assemble their team movies have kept to that style, which unfortunately is running thin.As for the characters, they could be interchangeable with others from the movie universe. Personally, I would have loved to see the original version of Star-Lord who was a much stronger character than the one here, who is a cross between Steve Rodgers and Tony Stark... He even had the ego and nerve to call himself 'Star-Lord' - what an arsehole. This should have been the title handed down to him from his father, who was a Universe Policeman. It also would've been nice to have had his original ship as it was a living entity and a character in its own right - but no, we stick to the formula.Gamora was just a green skinned Black Widow... with some of the same moves.Drax was a less powerful Hulk. Though he had the inevitable 'The bad guy killed my family' scenario, where the Hulk's incentive is to SMASH... Drax has the same compulsion but to KILL.The best thing, by far, were the two CGI characters of Rocket Raccoon and Groot who were brilliantly voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Cooper's vocal portrayal was so perfect for the character; and even though Groot only said 'Groot' Diesel added depth and character to every 'Groot' spoken.These two also seemed to get the better scene's like the one where they're planning to escape but are wondering how they can get one of the escape plans components. While they are talking about this Groot just goes and gets it. Then when the action starts it's always Rocket you look to because this Racoon loves his weapons with a passion verging on obsession.Respect to the actors who portrayed the hero's as they all did a great job it's not their fault there wasn't much scope for character growth. I just think that Marvel is coming close to stereotyping themselves. They could do with spreading their wings a little wider.With that in mind, it would be nice to have a villain who isn't trying to conquer or destroy worlds, we've seen it before. when we finally get to the much hinted at and waited for Thanos what will he be doing? Oh yes, probably looking to destroy or conquer the world.Then there's the awesome 80's soundtrack courtesy of Peter Quill's walkman... where does' he get the batteries from? Probably that's what the Ravagers were stealing on Earth when they picked him up. The director uses the soundtrack to it's greatest potential. Well done.All in all, it's a well told and fantastically rendered story, though all too familiar, with great action sequences, so leave your brain at the door and enjoy.",7,0,1,6 May 2017
Jurassic World," A Jurassic Turkey
","Since the early '90's I've enjoyed the Jurassic Park novels and movies. Not only were they groundbreaking for their special effects but they were intelligent stories, which were well filmed and acted by a stellar cast. I even have to admit to enjoying the third film in the series, which a lot of people have put down. So, when I saw this episode was on the drawing board I was a happy bunny. However, when I saw the cast line up and the story synopsis I decided I'd wait until the film made it onto telly. Two years from the release and the movie is on... Boy, was I glad I waited(?) What the hell were the writers and director thinking of(?) There are so many holes in the story it leaks crap in the majority of scenes. The acting ranges from abysmal to average. And, the special effects appear to be below par for the time - the opening corvid shot is really horrendous.Poor Michael Crichton is turning in his grave.What the first three films showed was that Murphy's Law was more than prevalent on an island where dinosaurs roamed. So what do we find when the film starts(?) The park is open and has been running for a few years. You just know they've been lucky so far and that their luck is soon to run out. Then we learn the scientists are creating new 'Dinosaurs' to keep the punters happy and spending their money. I can hear Malcolm screaming now, 'Will these idiots ever learn?' - Evidently not Malcolm. Even worse is that on the other side of the island they're trying to train raptors. Though we're never really told why they're being trained, there is a military element which wants them as weapons (yawn, what else(?)...). I think it's because somebody had a great idea for a CGI scene later in the film... and this is the only way they could link it in.This leads me to the CGI Choreography because this is what it is. There are sometimes when it's just way too overcooked to be believable. The nannies, Zara's (Katie McGrath) dance of death is a particular case in subject. For me, this was just ludicrous and stupid.Back to the errors in the story, saying that there were no 'Dangerous' animals on the island so the customers were never at risk was an outright lie. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), who runs the island actually believes this, even though the latest creation, which she signed off on, is very dangerous... as well as the raptors... which she also knew about... then at the climax of the film... well, this is one woman you shouldn't trust - ever.One annoying thing, for me, was when Claire reprimands a colleague for wearing an antique Jurassic Park T-Shirt because it could be upsetting to the customers because people died there. The thing is, he never mingles with the vacationers. Secondly, the voice on the tannoy, at one point, actually welcomes everybody to Jurassic Park - Not Jurassic World!I also hated the kids in this film. A geek and a trainee stalker. At least with the original kids, Tim and Lex you could relate to them, this, on the whole, is because there were well written and well acted. Grey (Ty Simpkins) and Zack (Nick Robinson) are pretty two dimensional and boring, which can also be said for the rest of the cast, especially Claire. Only Chris Pratt, as Owen, and Vincent D'Onofrio, as Hoskins, give decent performances, though their characters are very cliched.This is one boring, seen it all before, cliche-ridden film that I'd not recommend to anyone - even if the end scene is quite entertaining. I'll not watch this again and I cannot believe there's a sequel in the pipeline.",4,2,3,16 January 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A Wasted Chance To Make An Awesome Film
","Oh, dear! What happened here! This had the possibility to be a great film with depth... so what does Joss Whedon give the audience - a formulaic action film lacking in characterisation and an awful lot of changes to origin stories and ongoing characters, which didn't make sense. It felt so forced into being something big and spectacular that only helped in hindering my enjoyment of the film and story.Usually, I'd say that a movie is worth watching due to the story or the action but in this case, things don't seem to gel just right and the whole thing is messy and disjointed. This is definitely not the best in the Marvel Movie Universe... This is nearly on par with Iron Man 3 (another film which could have been awesome).I was having doubts in the opening action sequence as some of the CGI is sloppy, giving the scene an untidiness. You can easily tell which sections are CGI'd. Thank God things get tidier as the film progresses.Then there's Bruce Banner; a scientist with a clinical and logical mind who only wants to help people and would never hurt anyone... but suddenly is all too happy to let Stark activate an unknown AI though they know the dangers involved. This goes against the core nature of Banner but Whedon doesn't care. What would've been more in character would be Stark being his usual egotistical self and activating the AI on his own accord, only for Banner to find out and come in to keep an eye on things so nothing goes wrong, being too late to stop Stark It's such a little thing, but the devil's in the detailsWhen Ultron finally appears, nicely voiced by James Spader - though a little more creepiness and menace was needed (The 'I have no strings' vocal is actually more menacing in the trailer than in the movie scene), you think okay here we go, but it's over too quickly and feels more like a damp squid than impending doom and throws the pace of. In fact, there's a lot of stops and starts in the pace of this film, I'm not sure if that was Whedon's intention but it doesn't work.Even the one-liner quips between the team were lacking in humour and feel thrown in to lighten the sequence and entertain. The trouble being if it feels thrown in it loses its power and the feeling of reality the filmmaker is trying to create. Once that happens then the viewer breaks away from the film and it's not as entertaining for them.Two-thirds of the way through I'd pretty much given up on the film but decided to stay for the ground shaking final fight scene. Which wasn't really too special as it was just loads of Ultron's minions fighting on his behalf (though he had previously stated that they were all him). The thing is if Ultron was such a Bad Ass and believed himself superior to humans and the Avengers then he should have taken them on one on one, as they were helping the stranded people to leave. Then when he does attack he lets his drones do it for him and you have an epic battle with epic music, which doesn't feel so epic, then it only takes four Avengers to dispatch Ultron in... less than a minute! What a baddie!... another damp squid.Hey, maybe that should have been the title - Avengers: Age Of The Damp Squid!As I said in the review for Guardians Of The Galaxy, Marvel are in serious danger of stereotyping themselves and following a specific formula, which is even more evident in this film than in that one. This could be the slippery slope to failure if they don't beware.If you've liked the previous films in the Marvel Movie Universe then you may be able to get through this one, though I wouldn't recommend watching it as a stand alone film since there are better offerings out there. If you're a fanboy of the comics then it's probably best to stay well clear of this film, especially if you don't appreciate new interpretations as this isn't a good one. This movie could be a turning point for fans.",5,2,3,6 May 2017
National Treasure," A Rollicking Good 'Boy's Own' Adventure.
","Disney hit the right spot with this live-action adventure yarn. This film has everything. An imaginative and well-structured story. Fully fleshed-out characters that are both believable and relatable. Great direction, which takes you on an enthralling and entertaining rollercoaster ride of thrills, action, and history. In fact, there is very little wrong with this picture.Okay, so history isn't the most exciting of subjects when you're at school... and to be honest a lot of it still bores me. So when I heard the concept of the story I did groan a little. However, great news for me, and the rest of the audience, is that the team of writers keep this story very far away from Driesville. So thanks to Jim Kouf, Oren Aviv, Charles Segars, and Cormac & Marianne Wibberley for giving us such a great story and cast of characters. Down to this story and film alone, I prefer Benjamin Franklin Gates over Indiana Jones and Robert Langdon. Not only does Gates have something to prove it's personal. This gives him an added depth the others don't possess.But a movie is a visual beast. Thank God that Jon Turtletaub had a good and firm grip on the directorial reins. For one thing, he has a great eye. There wasn't a single instance where my eyes strayed from the screen. He has great composition and detail manipulation. Without this, the revelation of the 'treasure' clues would have lost a lot of their power, which would be a shame. Here he makes them a substantial part of the story. Though it's the action sequences that pack a considerable punch. I especially liked the chase scene after the declaration theft. This is fast, frantic, and furious fun. Turtletaub also directs his cast perfectly.This is practically the perfect cast. Granted the writers created a great ensemble but without the right actors and actresses to give them voice and emotions the film could have sunk. However, all the players portray their characters perfectly. Even the interactions between them are excellent. I particularly like the banter and connection that Gates and Ian Howe, Sean Bean, have. Once, partners in treasure hunting they are forced to become competitors. Though it gets deadly between them they keep the chatter light and friendly. It's also nice that in the frenetic storyline we are allowed to see the budding romance between Gates and Abigail Chase, Diane Kruger.So if you are looking for a lighthearted, treasure-hunting, action-adventure film then this should be one of the first films you look to. You won't be disappointed.Come on over and check out my The Game Is Afoot and Holding Out For A Hero and Guilty Pleasures lists to see where I've charted this film. You may even find something new to tickle your viewing fancy.",9,0,0,6 March 2020
Inside Man," A Classy Bank Robbery Film. Well Shot & Acted.
","This movie is one hell of a classy way to tell the story of a bank robbery. Spike Lee brings Gerwitz's story of an unusual bank robbery to life with a stylish noiristic flair. Though this isn't noir film there are definite overtones of the style throughout the film, which adds a greater depth and strength to the movie. Lee made a great choice here because I believe that without this element this could have easily been a boring film. There's not much action as most of the story is about trying to figure out what happened in the bank and just what were the robbers after. Luckily enough there's a plethora of acting talent to make this a very interesting movie, Even Clive Owen works well. I've always thought him to be very flat as an actor - verging on zero dimensional - though his woodenness works here as that persona is perfect for his character.The main letdown of the film is the story, which is also one of its greatest strengths. It's a letdown because it needed a tad more action and tension, there are a few cat and mouse scenes where these could have been expanded upon but were ignored. However, the strength comes from the whole concept, the twists, and the eventual climax of the story, which is brilliantly crafted and woven.The camera work is exemplary and on a couple of occasions beautiful. I particularly liked the pan shot from the rear of the police van as Frazier exits. The camera sweeps up and around, showing the crowd gathered at the cordon, then moves down in a slow arc to the person leaving the bank, surrounded police officers. The movement is so smooth. Then there's a great panning shot of the police officers as they search the bank after the hostages are released. This is, once again so steady and smooth. It was a pleasure to see as there's not a lot of this style of camera work around today.However, not all the camera shots work. The one where Frazier loses his temper and rushes out of the control vehicle is pretty risible and made me wince. Lee puts Washington on a wheeled stage and pulls him forward. at speed giving him a floating come flying movement. This was meant to represent his anger and haste at the situation. Unfortunately, the movement is juddering and the whole shot looks silly and feels wrong for the film; how it didn't end up on the cutting room floor. It would have been better to have Washington just run. Lee should check out the Nun scene from The Blues Brothers as this utilises the effect perfectly and makes the scene just perfect.Though this did detract from the film and breaks the link between the movie and its audience it doesn't do it to the point of hitting the off button.In fact, I would recommend this film to everybody who likes police procedures and stories with a mystery with plenty of twists. Back when this was made this would have been pretty original, though today, a lot of the issues in this film have been used quite a few times. A bank robbery that isn't a bank robbery. How do you get out of the building without being captured? Though, with Lee's involvement and the great cast, this is still worth a watch.",8,2,3,20 July 2017
The Conjuring," A Spookily Good Start To A Haunting Series...
","I'd heard bad reviews about this film from some friends so it took me a little while to get to it on my watch list... I've learnt a very important lesson from this, sometimes you're friends can me wrong...In this day and age of average horror flicks, it's so nice to come across a true eerily chilling masterpiece, which this is. I loved the fact that this story, and the other conjuring tales, is based on reported ghost and possession stories. I won't go as far as to say that these stories are real, though I do believe. Of course, they have been 'Hollywood''ed up to entertain the paying masses and get bums on seats. It's in this respect that both the writers, Chad & Carey W Hayes and director James Wan draw a perfect line to get the story across while making it entertaining.Wan is great at giving a scare too as he utilises everything in the 'Boo!' scare-book. From noise shocks to near-silent ramped up the tension. He plays with light and shadows to give you a nice scary atmosphere. This is something I've missed.Added to this, great performances from the cast, especially the kids as they truly make you believe they are being terrorised by an evil spirit. The section in the bedroom, where Christine (Joey King) is pulled from the bed and then warns her sister that he's behind her is the constant to this. These two performances, along with Wan's direction that make you believe there may be something in the deep shadows.All of this had me hooked right from the moment I hit the play button.Should you want a good scare and a film that will stay with you for a while, then this is the movie for you.",8,1,2,16 July 2019
Wonder Woman," The Best Of The New DC Universe Movies By Far
","Finally, the DC Movie Universe has made a film they can be proud of. This film is definitely a step in the right direction for the DC Superheros, though, it doesn't make up for the travesties which came before it. They should use this as the mile stick with which to measure their up and coming films. Though I cannot help but feel Justice League will be taking a few steps backwards from this film.I liked the fact that the writers decided to use mix the origin stories up and have Diana coming to the world of man during the First World War; this strengthens the concept of her being immortal. As well as allowing for some nice special effects in the dog fight scenes and other period specific weaponry. Zeus created the Amazons to bring love and peace to mankind, though mankind corrupted by Ares enslaved them. Hippolyte led a revolt to free the Amazons and when Zeus brought the god to help in their defence Ares killed them. Zeus with his dying breath crippled Ares and created Themyscira to hide the Amazons from mankind. So here is the first error, Zeus is dead but yet he later breathes life into a clay-shaped human effigy to create Diana. All is well on the island until Steve Trevor's plane crashes off the coast and Diana dives in to save him. Trevor has the secret poison book of Dr, Maru; the Germans hot on his trail shoot him down, Here comes a second error, there's a group of Germans in a rowboat looking for the wreckage of the plane, they stick their head through the fog which hides the island and then attacks the Amazons... and lose, of course. Though I did wonder where the battleship they came from and the one which had shot Trevor down has disappeared to... as we see no more Germans (sloppy writing). Believing Ares is to blame for the ongoing war, Trevor describes, Diana takes it upon herself to hunt him down and kill him, with the God Killer sword.As I stated there are a couple of obvious errors in the opening set up and this continues throughout the film. It would have been nice if somebody had pointed them out so they could be taken care off. Most of them are small issues and easily resolved but they do hinder the film a little. However, they are only small and the movie is pretty massive so the good does outweigh the bad. Though Gal Gadot does a good job in the Wonder Woman persona, she's not too great as Diana Prince. Saying she's coming from an island where the main way to travel is by horse and foot, where they are trained in sword fighting and archery, and the main food is fresh fish, vegetables and fruit she doesn't appear too surprised by automobiles, aeroplanes, ships, and the modern weaponry... let alone the 'new food'. Though they include the 'Ice Cream' scene it would have been nice to have seen a little more childish enthusiasm and awe in this character.Chris Pine fits the Steve Trevor character like a glove and gets his persona down pat, though a little more womanising, or even hints at it would've added strength to it. Lucy Davis is splendid as Etta Candy, Steve Trevor's secretary, and actually has the air of awe I wished Diana Prince to have. The bad guy Ludendorff and his crony Dr Maru are brilliantly played by Danny Huston and Elena Anaya, respectively. They give a creepy and flesh-crawling performance in their roles. David Thewlis was an inspired choice for Sir Patrick, though I have to admit I'm not too sure that he was completely right for the part, though I do know what the writers and director were doing when they cast him. Not a completely genius move, but close.Patty Jenkins does a marvellous job of the directing. She keeps the action tight and fast paced though has the nerve to slow it down at the right times to emphasize an action, a movement, or a special effect. This keeps it interesting for the viewer. Though in the more drama based sets she opts for a more standard style of camera work. A few differing camera angles would have been nice. Though this is a lighter film in atmosphere to other DC adaptations there are a lot of scenes shot in dark atmosphere's A little normal lighting and brighter sets would've strengthened the darkness and grimness of the front line, which was filmed with the same filters as their entry into London. So the front line could have been a muddy football field in London. It would have been nice to bring DC out of the dark fully.That said this is a really entertaining film, which sticks to the characters basic ethos. It is a spectacularly nice waste of time which I would recommend anybody to see and unlike previous DC Universe Movies, this one is really worth watching... and may even be worth keeping. As stated before, I hope they take heed of this movie and implement this style of film making and storytelling into their upcoming films.",8,5,13,19 July 2017
Footloose," An Okay Remake... Which Fails Slightly Because It's A Near Duplicate...
","This is pretty much a straight photocopy of the original film, though, with a few extras thrown in and a couple of new ideas.I liked the fact that the opening sequence is similar to the original. Initially, I was a little confused with the similarity but then the twist kicks in. It turns out to be the dance where the teenagers lose their lives and start the No-Dance Law. However, the parallels didn't stop at the start. Though I have to be grateful that the 'Tractor Chicken' scene was changed out for the bus demolition derby. This added a nice bit of excitement. Though the cover of Holding Out For A Hero was atrocious.Actually, Craig Brewer's direction is crisper than the first film, though it has less iconic moments as he just duplicated them. By doing this they lose some of their power. For example, Ren's 'Dance-Angry' scene in the abandoned barn. When Kevin Bacon did it you thought, wow, this guy is angry, look at those moves, and what attitude. Now, when Kenny Wormald does the 'Dance-Angry', even with the added moves and different camera angles you don't get the same thoughts... you're too busy thinking of Kev - sorry Ken.This happens a few times throughout the movie. Though 'Let's Hear It For The Boy' was a nice touch. I even preferred this version of the Reverend. Dennis Quaid gives a quieter and more controlled portrayal than John Lithgow (who was brilliant as the over-powering version). Quaid's Reverend is more fitting for this film.In fact, I liked most of this cast. Julianne Hough's Ariel is a little dirtier and more wild-child than Lori Singer's. Though Singer's and Bacon's on-screen chemistry was better and more believable. The best casting decision was Miles Teller as Willard. He fits the country-hick better than Christopher Penn did. He's also not as wooden as Penn was - a great bonus, as I didn't feel embarrassed for him when he came on-screen. I just have one question though, why did Andie MacDowell take this part. It's tiny and not that important. MacDowell doesn't bring anything to the part. Any other actress could have done better. While writing this review I realised I'd truly forgotten she'd even starred in the film - thank you IMDb for the cast list.I still prefer the original than this one, though only just. This is still a kick-ass rock-and-roll dance-to-live movie, which I found highly enjoyable. So if you like this sort of thing, give it a try - you shouldn't be disappointed.",7,0,1,22 September 2019
