Sucker Punch," Bottom line, one time watch, severely lacking the punch
","Caution don't watch the trailer over and over again, you might be bored while watching the movie. I personally like the way how Zack Snyder makes movies. Sucker Punch is his signature movie. Grand action sequences, heavy CGI, slow motion, kinetic camera angles. Decent effort from technical stand point of view. However the story lacks the punch.The story sets off in the 60's and gathers momentum as the characters are introduced. It instantly kicks into a wild range of fantasy locations, stunt sequences, its wonderful but half way through it was boring. Had the conclusion been any worse than portrayed it would have been a boring movie. My rating is 7*, I finished my popcorn and coke and thats about it.",Null,3,8,25 March 2011
