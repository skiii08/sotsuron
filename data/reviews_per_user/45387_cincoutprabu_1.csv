The King's Speech," Inspiration for persons who stutter!!
","This movie is well deserved to be rated 10 out of 10. It realistically portrays the difficulties of person who stutter (PWS). It's always a good news for a PWS to see success of another PWS, that too in a real history!! Although the treatment techniques used by Lionel Logue (the speech therapist in the film) are older, they surely are helpful to some PWS in many situations. But I fear whether the film concludes or ignores to say something on whether the stuttering is curable. However, the support and the compliments given by the fellow people to King George at the climax (after His war speech) are something to be noted and understood by most PWS people.The words 'But then I thought, he stammers so beautifully...' by the princess to King George are very nice!!",10,1,2,2 February 2011
