Casablanca," Casablanca Review
","This film had the classic love story and is probably on the list of top 5 films ever created. Personally this film did not really do much for me. The love story seemed kind of cheesy; although, I did really enjoy the main character and who he represented throughout the film. Humphrey Bogart, Richard, represented the Americans throughout the war, which represented isolationism. Richard shows isolation in the film by never drinking with anyone. My favorite line throughout the movie was 'I'll stick my neck out for nobody' and then the General replied with 'Ah, a wise foreign policy.' I think that was totally great. Another great aspect of the movie was the lighting. I think it was great when the light reflected off the sides of their faces and off the tops and brims of their hats. Overall the movie wasn't that bad, but I was expecting something way more complex than it actually was.",7,0,1,10 October 2014
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane
","I think that Citizen Kane's story line is to simplistic and unbelievably boring. I think that it does hold some neat aspects to it since it does jump around from the past to the present, but even with this element, it is surprisingly easy to follow. Because of this, it made watching the movie very dull and tedious. Since it was boring, the entire time I was watching the movie I felt that I was trying to figure out if I was missing a bigger picture or I wasn't grasping the true meaning of the film. I felt like I was missing something which maybe took away from the film itself. But then during those final scenes did it all come together and make sense. In the end it wasn't that bad of a movie. I did LOVE the lighting aspect in this film. It was a very bright film! I loved the way that the light reflected off the character's faces. I liked the very dark backgrounds and suits compared to the lighter aspects of the film like the walls of the buildings and the highlighted parts on their faces.",8,1,2,22 October 2014
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver Review
","Although this film was not my all time favorite I did think it did have a good overall message; war is damaging. I think Robert De Nero is perfect for this part; a veteran who has taken an overnight shifts as a taxi driver and is now obsessed with crime and cleaning up the city. I think it was interesting to see, even though it was terrible to watch, the progression of a veteran go from attempting to be a normal man post the war, to a crazy man at the end of the film. The end of the movie was great when he goes on the killing rampage in attempt to save the young girl. The cops come in and there he is sitting on the couch, after getting shot in the neck and he puts his bloody hand up to his head, in the shape of a gun, and pretends to shoot himself over and over again. This just shows how crazy he has really gotten over the course of time.",6,0,2,30 November 2014
Gone with the Wind," Gone With the Wind Review
","Gone with the Wind is an amazzzzzzzzzzzzzzingly long yet a wonderful classic film! The cinematography by Ernest Haller is truly gorgeous and add beautifully to the story as a whole. The story duration of this film is spanned over many years which seemed to drag the plot on for quite some time, especially since the screen duration is 238 minutes. But, for the most part the plot moved relatively at a fast pace. The plot was very complex. It had many love affairs going on at one time (love triangles), had the men at war and the women at home, and the multiple deaths of loved ones. I personally think that Scarlett should have given up on Ashley for Rhett Butler wayyyy before she did. This would have made the story line way more interesting. I also wished that they showed a little bit more of the men actually fighting in the war to get a gist of what that would have been like. I loved the scene when all the hundreds of bodies of the men were laying out on the ground and here comes Scarlett with her pink dress on looking for the Doc to deliver Melanie's baby. That was also a great use of cinematography. The above camera angle was perfect for that scene. Overall, even though the film was ridiculously long I did happen to thoroughly enjoy it!",9,4,6,16 November 2014
Annie Hall," Annie Hall Review
","I love the various editing strategies used in this film. I like the constant flashbacks that are used to tell the back story but the interesting aspect of this is that the two main characters, Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, are always in present time having a conversation about the good old times in the flashback. These flashbacks told the story of how they got to be the people they were currently, and how they got to be in the relationship they currently were in. I though this was a cool and interesting way to tell the back story. I also like that Woody Allen is the main character, but also is doubling as the narrator. The camera will focus on him, and the background will go fuzzy and mute everyone else out, while he talks to the camera and engages the audience (you) into the story. The editing strategies, I think, made the movie.",7,0,0,8 December 2014
The Graduate," The Graduate Review
","This film was great! Every aspect was perfect, especially the comedy aspect. This movie I think does a great job of touching upon the awkward relationship that Mrs. Robinson has with Ben; but more importantly it focuses upon the huge generation gap that there is between the two of them. The film does a great job of never referring to the adults with a first name; it is always Mr. and Mrs. Robinson etc. Also, there is very little dialogue during the sex scenes which makes Ben seem more experienced than he really is. The plot twist in this movie is great. I think it is perfect that Mrs. Robinson is jealous and worried that Ben will fall in love with her daughter and even goes as far as making him promise to never take her out on a date. When he realizes he is really in love with Elaine Robinson (the daughter) all hell brakes loose. The very last scene when Ben and Elaine ran away together and exchange looks on the bus is absolutely perfect. It is a look of 'oh my, what have we just done?' and 'we barley know each other'. This was the perfect way to end this film.",9,0,0,30 November 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' In the Rain
","I absolutely loved the musical Singin' In The Rain (1952). It was fantastic!!! This film was originally a MGM film produced by Arthur Freed. Freed was also an uncredited produced on The Wizard of Oz. I LOVED the color in this film. It was bright and vibrant. Singin' In The Rain was done in a 3 part Technicolor; shot in three strip black and white printed, printed with dye and then transferred onto a single strip of film. This film was truly amazing and is what I consider to be a classic. It was ranked number 5 on the list of greatest American films in 2007. The only part of the film that I truly didn't appreciate was the end when he was trying to explain his vision of the end of his musical to the producer. I feel like we could have still gotten the point of it if it were a whole lot shorter. Another aspect that I loved, besides the color, was the use of all the difference dances throughout the film. I notice that they used ballroom, tap, ballet, line and whole bunch more. Watching them dance was more entertaining than the actual plot at times! Overall, I think this is the best musical I have watched.",9,0,1,2 November 2014
The Wizard of Oz," The Wizard of Oz Review
","The Wizard of Oz was my all time favorite movie when I was younger! After giving this movie a fresh look, after not watching it for a few years, I still noticed that there were those few parts that I absolutely loved! I think the special effects in this movie are great! I loveeeed when I was younger, and still do, the color changing horse! I also liked the entrances/exits of the Wicked Witch with the smoke/fire! Another great special effect is in the very beginning when the tornado hits and the lady is riding by on her bike, and as she passes the window, she gradually gets closer to it; at the closest point she turns into a witch. I love the fact that Dorothy's uncles in the beginning are the same characters or representative of the same characters as she finds down the yellow brick road (scare crow, tin man, and the lion). I also like the whole general meaning of the movie. I think that it is a great children movie because of this. It teaches you that you have to look within yourself to find the parts of you that you are missing; you can't just expect someone to give it to you. Overall, I love this movie!!!!!!!!!",10,10,12,5 October 2014
