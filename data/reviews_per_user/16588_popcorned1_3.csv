Mission: Impossible III," The Impossible Has Happened - the Best of the Lot
","There was no way I was going to miss seeing this movie, but that being said, there was no way that I thought it was going to be as good a movie as it was.Yes, Tom's a hero of impossibly high proportions; yes, Hoffman is an impossibly evil villain; yes, the effects and situations are from an impossibly improbable parallel universe - people know things they could never know, random events happen precisely on cue, and the IMF accomplishes things that are, in a word, IMPOSSIBLEÂ… But this movie is much better than I expected it to be.Instead of going out with a whimper, this movie was the best MI so far, and it definitely paves the way for the fourth installment.SPOILER BELOW|||||||||\ /\/One particularly graphic bit of violence was made all the more graphic and almost physically palpable by occurring off-screen. I think everyone wanted to see Philip Seymour Hoffman really get what was coming to him. But in the end, I don't think anyone, not even those with a penchant for violence, were disappointed. No one is waiting for 'the other shoe to drop.' One shoe was plenty...",9,0,0,15 May 2006
The Departed," Martin's best ever...
","I haven't voted '10' for a movie before - I've always felt that giving a '10' rating is that's like saying there's no room for improvement, and there are always elements that could have been done better. And no matter what you're doing, there's always room for improvement. But this was a definite 10. The pacing, the plot, the characters, the performances... This was a terrific movie. There's no doubt that in the future The Departed will be the new benchmark for this genre.The cast is brilliant. I have always been a fan of Nicholson, and here he is even better than usual. Some say he is too over-the-top, but I disagree. The character he plays is himself over the top, and I think it is a perfect performance. Damon's Colin Sullivan is a stunning picture of evil. A man with terrific abilities and, the way he looks to that golden dome, a man with dreams of other better things, but he is so hooked into his patron that he can't get out, and in the end embraces the entanglements as what his life is. Leonardo is such a classic tragic figure in this. Unbelievable... To be willing to sacrifice himself in this way. I think it shows a more realistic picture of what this kind of double life must be than anything I have seen.Every supporting character is just as flawlessly portrayed. I may never vote '10' again, but this one deserves it. Scorcese's best ever.",10,4,8,9 October 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," A different trajectory from the book...
","***SPOILER ALERT***I never read the books until after I saw the first movie. There was quite a bit of difference between the book and the movie, but there was also quite a bit of similarity. Having said that, this 2nd installment - with the death of Maria - takes a completely different turn, and the similarities to the book are for the most gone. Bourne's relationship with Maria was motivational for the character to keep going on, and now that she is gone, he is a completely different character. I don't see anyway that the 3rd movie will be recognizable as a growth from the same soil as the Ludlum books, and I could see where fans of the books might be disappointed. So it seems to me that fans of the books who are purists are the ones who will vote this movie lower. I think that this new direction brings with it new possibilities. Not worse or better, but definitely different. And I thought the books were great, but I look forward to seeing where this new direction might lead. I just hope we don't have to wait as long for the 'Ultimatum.'",9,3,4,2 August 2004
