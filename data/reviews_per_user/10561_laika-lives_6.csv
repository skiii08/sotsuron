Mission: Impossible III," Love Lies Bleeding
","The smartest decision made in Hollywood in recent years (by Cruise?) has been the constant redefinition of Mission: Impossible as a series (lets not call it a franchise - an uglier term than which I don't know). First de Palma, then Woo, and now, improbably, Abrams. They almost seem to represent the three essences - mind, body, and spirit, in that order.With de Palma, it was all coolly cerebral game playing, a blockbuster that made you work hard to untangle the plot and dispatched likable minor characters with the icy demeanour of a sniper. It had lengthy tracking shots, a camera that passed through walls, and three big set pieces that unspooled with clockwork precision.With Woo, it was sensual - never mind the plot, feel the heat of the explosions, hear the growl of the engines, watch some of the most impossibly beautiful destruction ever filmed unfold like a painting in motion. The epic female vocals reinforced the point.With Abrams, it's all about the emotions. He could no more treat his characters with De Palma's olympian disdain then he could slave them to Woo's visual flair. These characters bleed when they get hurt.When, in the best action sequence of the film, a bridge comes under attack, the viewer isn't simply swept up in the excitement - in the back of the mind lingers the understanding that the balance of power is changing, that a character who was formerly safe is about to become a target - and that we've been told what will happen to her long in advance. An early sacrifice ensures that we're not certain that any character is safe - any of them could go, at any time. For once, we care enough for this to matter.Philip Seymour Hoffman is the best screen villain I've seen in a long time - he feels genuinely threatening; simply by uttering the hero's name he changes the entire tenor of the film, makes it queasy with unease.Michelle Monaghan is great in what seems to be a small part; she gets to be the action girl at the end, which may feel a little unlikely but suits the film entirely (and it's nice to see Tom Cruise step aside a little to let his co-stars shine in moments like this - the unspeakably cool Maggie Q benefits in particular).Other wonderful bits include Simon Pegg's scary-funny monologue, and Cruise's fake enthusiasm for traffic at the beginning - 'it's like a living organism!' He comes across like a real human being for the first time in a long time.This has been the most under-rated, underestimated series in modern American cinema - by turns smart, overwhelming and now moving. The action film has long been a tired genre, but these three films have helped to wake it up just a little.",8,0,0,16 May 2006
Alien: Resurrection," Some perspectives on Alien: Resurrection
","The Auteurist Perspective - The most unorthodox way of viewing this picture is as a kind of formalist exercise. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has talked about his desire to make a film tailored exactly to the format of a Hollywood action movie, even going so far as to count the number of cuts and camera set-ups in the blockbusters he watched for research. Everything in the movie may be taking place within quotation marks, as in the melodramas of Douglas Sirk or, more obliquely, Gus van Sant's 'Psycho'. The film wants to be both an archetypal big sci-fi action movie whilst simultaneously a pastiche of the form. The gorgeously overblown shot of Ripley and Call standing amid the clouds at the film's close certainly suggests a playful tweaking of blockbuster bombast. However, the 'Alien' series may not be the most appropriate place for this experiment; the series is far more defined by spaces and silences than by frenetic action of the Bruckheimer variety. Even James Cameron's 'Aliens' is surprisingly slow in its build-up; by contrast, Resurrection's relentless pace becomes oddly monotonous and the film loses the distinctive texture Jeunet brings to it.The Whedonite Perspective - The problems with the script are mostly additions or changes to Joss Whedon's original (which is available online). Whedon rightly made Ripley's resurrection the backbone for the story, finding new things to do with a character many believed had reached the end of her life, both literally and creatively. He also carefully fleshed out the supporting characters just enough to keep them interesting. There are small problems even in his original script - Purviss is sidelined when his predicament demands imaginative exploration, and the narrative is more linear than you'd expect from this writer. But it's the feeble alterations that damage the film - reducing characters like Hillard (in particular) to cyphers, changing the ending so the audience never gets to see earth (the only place, as Whedon instinctively understood, that the climax could possibly take place), and removing a lot of the texture of the setting, like the marijuana fields. 'I'm a stranger here myself' should have been one of the great closing lines in movie history, up there with 'Tomorrow is another day' and 'Shut up and deal', but the dialogue (Whedon's great strength) is mangled by a director working in his second language, and who seems to be paying more attention to the lighting anyway.The Cynical Perspective - The 'Alien' series is, by this point, a cash cow that everyone involved wants to milk until it bleeds. 'Alien3' ended Ripley's story with an unflinching finality that 'Resurrection' can only cheapen, no matter how good it is. The hiring of a cult french director is a sop to the critics who lionise Scott and Fincher's contributions - and whilst prior instalments were filmed in England, this production was mounted in LA, for the convenience of everyone involved. It wouldn't do to make too much of an effort on what is, after all, the latest sausage on the string. The suits' only concern is the opening weekend; hence Winona, shoehorned in just in case Sigourney's box office draw is waning.The Aesthetic Perspective - John Frizzell's score is the fourth classic in a row for the series; both lushly romantic and queasily menacing, it gives the film its own distinctive flavour. The production design is bold and distinctive, with perhaps a hint of playful parody (the sickly green light, the mad scientist outfits, the giant glass jars in the lab); the film looks like a comic strip version of its predecessors. Some of the direction is highly effective - the underwater sequence is devastatingly beautiful. The problem is the slightly over-ripe grotesquerie Jeunet brings out in the material, particularly in the way the cast is shot (Dominique Pinon looks like a malevolent garden gnome, Dan Hedaya resembles a sweaty gendarme). It sits uneasily with the straightforward disaster movie plot. The biggest miscalculation on the production front, however, is the Newborn. The thinking behind it - to give it an expressive face and thus complicate Ripley's (and our) emotional response to it - is sound enough, but it doesn't really come off in the finished creature, which looks like moldy old tissues clinging to a pipe-cleaner frame. Whedon's original conception of a white, red-veined alien of the traditional design might have worked more effectively, although even that might not have survived the aesthetic indignity of its impossible demise, getting sucked into space as a string of alien linguine.",6,138,195,10 August 2007
Batman Returns," Smitten with a Whip
","So what is 'Batman Returns', anyway?It was marketed as an action film, and many people who've seen it seem to think that they've watched an action film - but really, there isn't that much action, and Tim Burton barely seems interested in it.People often align it with the 'grittier' superhero comics of the late eighties, but honestly, if you've read 'The Dark Knight Returns', that seems just a little absurd; Burton's excessive imaginings have more in common with the day-glo sixties TV series (the Penguin drives around in a giant plastic duck, for goodness' sake).Burton's style is often described as Gothic, and that's a little closer to what we see on screen; the Penguin - deformed, malign, with a tangled history and a subterranean lair - is a Gothic menace dressed up in more respectable Dickensian clothes - Udolfo masquerading as Uriah Heep. But what of Catwoman? She may be raised from the dead, but that PVC catsuit is decidedly Twentieth Century, and her alter ego Selina Kyle's world is all boardrooms and apartments - reminiscent of a 1930s romantic comedy.And then it clicks. The smart but downtrodden secretary romanced by a lonely millionaire? The ensuing complications caused by deception and disguise? 'Batman Returns' is, quite clearly, a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered through Burton's S&M dungeon sensibilities. It has more in common with 'The Hudsucker Proxy' (including expressionist sets) than it does with other superhero films. Like many a romantic comedy, it centres around the make-over of the heroine; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the performances of her (often remarkable) career; she's iconically sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had a prayer), playful and vindictive, memorable because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, though, it's her scenes as Selina that impress; almost every one of them is a little comic gem, particularly the glimpse we get of her lonely home life. It's a delicately balanced tragicomic performance, and it's in these scenes that the film really sparks to life. Nothing moves me quite like Selina and Bruce Wayne dancing under the mistletoe to Siouxsie and the Banshees, a gun held between them, simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos, doomed to conflict. Forget the easy sentimentality of 'Big Fish' or the gossamer emotions of 'Edward Scissorhands' - this is the most heartfelt scene in all of Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-loathing and not a little wit, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - particularly Pfeiffer. Elsewhere, Danny de Vito almost matches her, finding the wounded dignity buried beneath those truly repellent long-johns. The upper-crust villain of the comics is revealed to be nothing more than a sham; Burton's Penguin is a feral creature subjected to his own, Eliza Doolittle-style make-over (almost literally an 'ugly duckling'). It's Burton's most radical - and funniest - reinvention. Christopher Walken's Max Schreck completes a perfect triptych of villains, sliding between casual charm and blank-eyed psychosis with unnerving ease (and is it just me, or does his company's logo bring to mind Mickey Mouse? Perhaps we should ask former Disney animator Burton).Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' - a real action film - has been much praised as the first film to do justice to Batman; I admire Nolan's film, but it would be a pity if it were allowed to overshadow this idiosyncratic gem.",9,18,41,10 September 2006
Psycho," Janet Leigh - Hiding In Plain Sight
","There's very little to be said about this most analysed and rewatched of films that hasn't been said multiple times before, but I'd like to draw attention to a great performance that, I think, has been unjustly and perversely neglected. Whilst most commentators (rightly) praise Anthony Perkins for his astonishingly nuanced performance, many overlook the subtler, more measured work done by Janet Leigh.At first, it seems paradoxical that Leigh could be overlooked in what is certainly her most famous role (one of the most famous roles in American cinema, in truth), but it is that very fame that causes people to overlook the actual quality of the work she is doing. After all, the part of Marion Crane is seen almost entirely in relation to the plot's structure - the heroine who is killed half way through the film, and leaves us and the camera somewhat stranded in the Bates Motel, where we begin to follow the story of Norman Bates. It doesn't help that her death scene is probably the most iconic film sequence yet recorded (the Odessa Steps sequence in 'Battleship Potempkin' doesn't have the pop culture cache, trust me). Who notices the actress when Hitchcock's structural and technical experimentation come together with such incendiary force? And yet Leigh is extraordinary, giving what might be the performance of her career. She'd proved herself a winning comedienne and musical star in the fifties, but often seemed to be left on the sidelines - as in the enjoyable 'Scaramouche' and the turgid, tacky 'Black Shield of Falworth' (which nevertheless shows her at her most beautiful - the improbably gorgeous black gown she wears in one scene is the epitome of 'devastating'). Of the three dark thrillers she made in the late fifties and early sixties, she would be excellent in what amounts to three scenes in 'The Manchurian Candidate', and had been perfectly cast but arguably peripheral to the story in 'Touch of Evil'. In 'Psycho', she disappears after forty minutes, but for once gets to hold the screen absolutely in the time she does have.It's a precise performance that shows no strain. She's controlled, immaculate, yet also believably sexual. Mores were changing, and 'Psycho' was at the forefront. There's something oddly shocking about seeing Leigh in her underwear (it would have been taboo under the Hayes code only a short while before), let alone in the shower, but Leigh betrays no discomfort. It's all done so casually, it barely seems as though anything new is being done.What's striking about 'Psycho' on repeat viewings is how melancholy it is. It may be the saddest film the Master ever made ('Vertigo' is bleak in a different way; it has the structure of Tragedy. 'The Wrong Man', meanwhile, has a forced happy ending). A large part of this is down to Leigh, who has to make us care about this woman in a short space of time. She succeeds, but she also succeeds in drawing out the kinkiness and oddness of Marion - the smile she gives when she imagines what is being said about her, for instance, before it gives way to worry and even fear (I've always thought that Leigh was rather wasted as good girls and would have made a great femme fatale - those big eyes and heart-shaped face are perfect - and as Marion she plays on a lot of the qualities that would have made her ideal).A small word here for Vera Miles here, too. Her role is more restricted, but her brittle, guarded performance is another overlooked gem, probably because she isn't warm or sympathetic. Her character is flinty and highly competent, Marion's more respectable counterpart. Their performances resonate with each other astoundingly well given that they don't share any screen time - they really are believable sisters, despite not looking that much alike. Lila Crane is, in many ways, Hitchcock's most straightforward, unkinky heroine. She's also one of his most uncompromising, not brooking argument from Sam Loomis or the Sheriff. Only Arboghast ruffles her. She penetrates to the heart of the mystery with ruthless efficiency. And in a film well known for its ironic one liners, my favourite is Lila's 'I can handle a sick old woman', which works differently depending on whether you know the secret of the film or not (she can't handle that sick old woman - but actually, it isn't a sick old woman at all).",10,2,3,14 May 2006
Scream 2," Not Quite The Godfather Part 2, But...
","'Scream 2' is one of those films that seems to have suffered most from the backlash against the knowing, self-referential horror films of the late nineties. Not only is it the sequel to the film that started the whole movement ('Wes Craven's New Nightmare' notwithstanding), but it carries the postmodernist game-playing to a new level. Horror purists loathed it for being populist and 'ironic', critics hated slasher movies on principle, and the larger audience were suffering from in-joke fatigue by the time they saw it. So unfortunately, nobody notices that not only is it a better film than the one it succeeds, it's probably the best horror film of the period.The opening sequence is particularly striking. Everything that made the original's celebrated opening sequence so iconic is either subverted or built upon. So again, a young woman and her boyfriend are stalked and murdered, but this time it plays out in a crowded cinema (showing a tacky reinterpretation of the original, just to reinforce the connection). Where the horror used to be in isolation, it is now found in alienation - the nightmare of dying in front of hundreds of people and nobody lifting a finger to help you is particularly potent. The iconography of ghost-face is played upon here too, not only in the film-within-a-film but the masks members of the audience wear. Given that the film seems to be a refutation of the old 'violent movies cause violence' argument (Sarah Michelle Gellar's character acts as the voice of sanity, Timothy Olyphant's character parodies what Wes Craven clearly considers the voice of insanity), it's striking that in this opening sequence the audience is seen as partly culpable for the murder. The moment when a bleeding Jada Pinkett-Smith cries out on stage, framed by the projection of ghost-face's mask (and bleached out by the white light, an interesting visual cue back to the debate over black characters in horror films that opens the film), and the baying audience subside in uneasy realisation, is one of the most indelible images in a horror film I've ever seen, and a slap in the face for the (real) audience, who have come to the cinema in order to see people get sliced up, after all. It takes a brave movie to implicate its viewers before the film has really got going, and certainly underlines the fact that this is neither a dumb slasher flick or a cheap cash-in on the success of the original.The potency of the death of this character we have only spent a few minutes in the company of illustrates something else about 'Scream 2' (and 'Scream', for that matter) - that, despite the repeated use of the word by lazy magazine and newspaper critics who ought to know better, they are not 'ironic'. No wonder Kevin Williams turned the definition of the word into a running joke in his later script 'Teaching Mrs Tingle'; he must have been sick of the misallocation of the word in almost every review he read. It implies a style that contrasts the apparent and actual meaning of situations and dialogue. Irony in this sense undercuts what we are being shown and what the characters experience, usually turning it into bathos. There is no irony in the deaths of the characters in 'Scream 2', unlike 'Final Destination 2', for instance, where characters being sliced into pieces by a flying wire fence or crushed by a falling pane of glass are both moments of horror and moments of humour. In contrast, when Hallie buys it so soon after surviving the film's most excruciating suspense sequence, it's horrific because she's a likable, funny character who doesn't deserve to die. The audience responds to the characters on an emotional level, mainly because of Williams's unfairly uncelebrated skill at creating three-dimensional characters in just a handful of scenes (compare with 'Scream 3', scripted by Ehren Kruger, where only Parker Posey's self-obsessed film star stands out), but also because of the skills of an above average cast (particularly Courtney Cox-Arquette, Jamie Kennedy and Liev Schreiber - although frankly Laurie Metcalf calmly pockets the entire movie in a single scene. Compare also Neve Campbell's likable, determined Sidney with Jennifer Love Hewitt's Julie Jameson in the 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' films - a drip written (initially by Williams, irritatingly) and acted with half the skill, who constantly needs rescuing by her boyfriend as though she were the heroine of a Victorian melodrama). These are not the corpses-in-waiting of most slasher films, but funny, rounded individuals with their own foibles who die senselessly and horribly. The humour (and it is a very, very funny movie) is not at the expense of the horror, or the characters enduring it. It's also worth noting the real skill with which Craven orchestrates the suspense, the excellent use of music (particularly some borrowed from the 'Broken Arrow' score), Tori Spelling's gameness (although she gives away the plot twist of 'Stab' in that interview!), and Portia di Rossi's remarkable eyebrows. This movie needs serious re-assessment. Personally, I think it's richer than your average horror-snob's favourite.",9,2,2,7 April 2006
Saboteur," Citizen Kane, or 'the surest test of the American heart.'
","Conventional critical thinking holds that 'Shadow of a Doubt' was Hitchcock's first truly American film. After all, his first few projects in Hollywood consisted of two English Gothic mysteries with all-British casts, a romp through Europe with a token Joel McCrea, and an obscure screwball comedy that he did as a favour to a friend. How conveniently they pass over 'Saboteur', a rather clumsy piece of wartime propaganda with none of the critical standing of Hitchcock's subsequent masterpiece. The small town setting of 'Shadow of a Doubt' is warmly welcomed as authentic, if subversive, Americana. On the other hand 'Saboteur', the argument goes, is just a reworking of British classic 'The 39 Steps', with Hitchcock displaying a tourist's eye for landmarks like Radio City Music Hall and the Statue of Liberty.Nuts to that.'Saboteur' is as authentically American as anything Hitchcock would later achieve; if critics failed to recognise the United States he showed them, it may say more about their preconceptions of a meritocratic New World than any failure on his part. After all, this is an America where an honest working man, doing his part for the war effort, can find his life falling apart through the machinations of the rich and idle; where the overworked (the lorry driver), the disabled (Pat's uncle), and the outcast (the circus folk) know that they must help their fellow victims in the face of what seems like routine police harassment; and where the wealthy can make troublesome proles who gatecrash their charity benefits 'disappear'. The use of Romain's 'The Death of a Nobody' seems highly pointed. Soda City, meanwhile, is a ghost town haunted by the worst times American workers had known - the great depression (contemporary viewers could not have missed the significance of it having been abandoned at the end of the 1920's).Meanwhile, the requisite patriotism for Hollywood films of this period is neatly pricked by Hitchcock and his writers. Whilst everyone insists on bleating on about the great American virtues, Pat's uncle and the circus folk quietly assert an alternative paradigm of American life. Pat herself - 'little Miss Liberty, carrying her torch' - only becomes the heroine once she learns to put aside her zealous urge to be a good citizen. In this context, the symbolism of the Statue of Liberty - as hope for the dispossessed, rather than an icon of patriotism - seems sharper than critics would allow.The casting of Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane as the leads, as opposed to the bigger names Hitchcock was growing accustomed to, seems rather apt in a film about little people caught up in the grinding wheels of war and espionage. Cummings' Barry Kane will never be anybody's favourite Hitchcock hero, and when the director brought him back for 'Dial M for Murder', there was a merciless irony imposed on the character. Lane is better, particularly as the film progresses, but she's solid rather than interesting; her character is just too nice. The villains are, however, fantastic, particularly Otto Kruger as the charmer who scarpers the country. His delight in both his granddaughter and his treachery are a joy to behold. There's a savage irony in that, of all the villains, it's only hired lackey Fry (the small variety, one presumes) who gets his comeuppance at the climax. As usual, the rich get clean away.All the critical contortion to overlook this film is, perhaps, understandable. The writing is highly inconsistent, with exposition ladled all over the place and the propaganda elements laid on with a cement mixer, to the point that it suffocates some of the finer scenes, such as the encounter with the circus folk (compare with the relatively elegant 'Foreign Correspondent', or the dramatically tighter 'Lifeboat'). The set pieces at Tobin's ranch, Mrs Sutton's party, the Radio City Music Hall (with the uncannily inappropriate laughter of the audience at the violent on screen murder) and the Statue of Liberty (a reminder of the days when the French were seen as forerunners of American ideology, rather than cheese-eating surrender monkeys) are master classes, but a lot of the rest of the film seems poorly paced and indifferently acted.But, oh, what a title sequence.",6,3,7,23 June 2007
