The Avengers," Nothing short of perfection!
","Firstly if i could rate this higher i most certainly would. I went in the cinema expecting a good movie and unlike the rest of the marvel movies which were done superbly, I thought the director (Joss Whedon) would not keep up to the benchmark the rest of the movies have set. In fact he has raised that benchmark so high that the movie was absolutely stunning. All heroes had a very special role and that was shown clearly and efficiently. As usual you would not expect much humour in a film of this genre, but the Avengers have certainly made that one of their most prized attributes.The hulk impressed me the most, having watched the previous hulk movies, I did not think Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) would get me interested but the Hulk made the movie humorous and exciting for the audience, showing colossal amounts of power and rage. The Black Widow definitely showed that she is more than just a 'pretty face' showing her skills and amazing figure, working together with Hawkeye who has made a genuinely interesting entrance. As presumed Iron man does not fail to impress with his down to earth personality and high tech equipment which play a very important role in keeping the avengers intact.Moreover Thor makes a outstanding entrance showing himself trying to keep his brother Loki under control who on the other hand is an exquisite villain. Furthermore Captain America shows himself and his shield worthy of being in the squad. Nick Fury does play a dominant and influential role, his character is explained in more detail as he shows authority over the avengers.*The only downside to watching this movie would be the 3D. I found that a movie of this standard must be watched glasses free to experience pure brilliance.*The movie has exceeded expectation, amazing screen play by all characters, terrific script, excellent story, breathtaking effects.The Avengers was truly 'Marvel'ous!",10,2,6,2 May 2012
