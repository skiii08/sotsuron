Scarface," His World
","This movie is a masterpiece. Tony Montana starts a new life in America. But he becomes a gangster. Brian depalma directs, and Al Pacino does a terrific performance as Tony. You really believe he is a gangster. The ending is one of the most epic endings to date. This movie will be watched for ever. Tony isn't scared of anything. This movie is definitely better than the 1932's one. In the 1932's version he is Italian. In this version he is Cuban. I think that just adds to the awesomeness. Because his accent is so ridiculous over the top. The amount of cocaine in this movie is insane. This is not a kids movie. Please watch this movie. 10/10",10,0,2,15 December 2012
