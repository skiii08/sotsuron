E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A very touching movie.
",I thought E.T. was a very special movie because it shows that friendship can not be limited to members of the same species. It showed that friendship as well as love can be blind if its genuine. It can conquer all! I would recommend this movie for the whole family!!!!,10,1,2,22 December 1999
U-571," Outstanding!!!!
",I LOVE this movie!!!! This is one of the best war movies I've seen and believe me I've seen them all. It was well-acted well scripted and all & all 1 hell of a movie. I've never considered myself a Matthew McConaughey fan but after seeing this movie I am.,10,2,12,9 May 2000
Titanic," By far my favorite movie!
",I think James Cameron's Titanic is the best movie ever made. It offers something for everybody. I think that Leonardo Dicaprio should have at least been nominated for the Oscar for best actor. The film was well acted and well scripted. The visual effects are unmatched. There simply is no better movie!,10,1,2,18 December 1999
