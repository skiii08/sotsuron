Blade Runner 2049," BRILLIANT VISUALS AND GOD ! THE BACKGROUND MUSIC
","This movie is sequel . There is only so much new one can add to the storyline. But the ignoring that and the many negative reviews . This move is s brilliant experience.Ryan Gosling is brilliant . Concept of Artificial Intelligence is also very interesting. But the background score is breathtaking. This movie takes science fiction to a new level of imagination.This is what a sci-fi should look like in 2017 for the year 2049.
Anyways great movie , great direction ( for a moment the robustness of the visuals reminded of Christopher Nolan.",10,0,5,7 January 2018
