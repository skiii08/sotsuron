Ghost," Decent, the 6.6 is about right
","I wish my own experience with a ghost had turned out as clear and happy as the one in this movie. Patrick Swayze is not a great actor, and neither is Demi Moore, but they can pull it off when they need to, and here they do as fine a job as they do in any other of their films. Whoopi Goldberg has always chose these kind of roles--independent women with lots of talent (remember Eddie?). The film has no cohesive photographic style, though, and the art direction is similarly disjointed. Still, if you need a feel good ghost story, you can go in for this one. I am still dealing with my most unpleasant ghostly experience (I lived in a haunted house, and I recognise how unbelievable that sounds).",6,3,9,15 April 2006
