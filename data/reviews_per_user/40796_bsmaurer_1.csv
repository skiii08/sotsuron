The Blair Witch Project," Ignorant People Just Won't Get It
","Dear Harsh Critics of the Blair-Witch Project:It sickens me to think of all the ignorant people out there complaining about the quality of the BWP video or the annoyance of the characters, because that is in essence what I like about the movie.  The movie makes no effort to be thrills OR chills. . . it just attempts to show you what would REALLY happen if gen-Xers went into the woods and experience what before was ONLY a legend firsthand.  I've heard people say 'Oh, how stupid do you have to be to get lost in the woods?' and my reply to that is that they were never supposed to leave.  That was the whole point of it.  Supernaturality changes all dimensions of reality and this is what one has to expect.  So what if the characters broke down and cussed and were annoying--thats reality.  How many people can you claim to know who wouldn't freak out after four days in the woods and something attacking you every night?  Don't you realize that your cushy little suburban houses and apartments will give you nothing but reason to make fun of a camping venture?  I went out into the woods less than a week before seeing the movie, and I realize firsthand that all one needs to be scared is his or her own mind.  I went into the theatre to enjoy the movie, whereas most people went in to disprove a 'hyped movie.' This sickens me.  If you are determined to break apart a movie before you go in, then you will hate the movie.  But if you go in with the notion that maybe you might be able to enjoy this for its reality and creativity and simplicity, then who knows?  You may not act like a total *&#!head when you write your next review.  So from now on, I implore you to look away from the everyday explosions and guns and sex and instead look for a steadfast film which will challenge your mind and delve into the depths of the human soul and reality the way that the Blair Witch film did.  (And yes, I am an avid fan of Die Hard Movies)  But what really needs to happen lately is an awakening in the entertainment industry to challenge its viewers to think rather than be thought for, as the way it is these days.  If we disobey the norms of this 'Dawson's Creek/MTV' era, then maybe we'll be a little bit more individualistic and real to ourselves rather than be just another name on a BIG MOVIE BOX OFFICE ticketholder.  Also, does anyone realize how bad the Titantic sucked but how good it became because of its hype?  It won best picture... err... bought best picture, when it had no business even being nominated!  It showed no real ingenuity other than the best special effects James Cameron's money can buy and yet everyone loved it, just because they were supposed to.  So I urge all of you Blair-Witch Nay-sayers to get off your asses and view this film as psychology and reality rather than spectre's and amateur video.  Its supposed to be amateur.  Its supposed tobe annoying.  But most importantly, its supposed to be real.  So enjoy this fact, this innovation rather than shoot it to the ground because it doesn't fit the norm of what Hollywood has conditioned us to think.",10,1,2,8 August 1999
