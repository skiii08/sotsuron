Blade Runner 2049," Most robotic actors of their generations type-cast for slog-fest
","While the original Blade Runner's innovation made up for its plodding pace, the '2049' sequel is not much more than a nostalgic homage with an extra dose of Quaalude. Not even the Cuban-anime hologram-robot hybrid sex scene made up for the slow-motion dialogue, blocking and lingering cinematography that turned a 20 minute story into a 2.5 hour tedium as dreary as its drone music soundtrack . Uncanny how leads the in both versions were played by the most robotic actors of their generation.",6,4,7,18 November 2017
La La Land," College amateur production about being a jerk
","The moral of the 'La La Land' story is 'you can't have your cake and itif you are a jerk.' No wonder this film was so popular in Hollywood where so many jerks abound who can feel reassured that their messed up lives are fate, not because of their own idiocy. Yes, you can have the love of your life and pursue the passion of your lifeif you're not a jerk about it. And have contrived, ego-laden dinner conversations that you storm away from with the emotion maturity of a 12 year old. The very first sequence sets the two protagonists up as couple of self- absorbed jerks. And the final sequence pivots on what could have been if Sebastian hadn't been a jerk from the outset.But other than that, the film had all the hesitant dance steps, plot transparency, wooden acting (except Emma Stone), off-key singing, and simplistic 2 chord tune drilled into the ground of a college amateur production.",6,0,1,18 November 2017
