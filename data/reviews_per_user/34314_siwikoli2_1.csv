The Longest Yard," Another dreadful remake of a good prison movie.
","Burt Reynolds keeps trying to look like he did when this movie was originally made. Neither he nor this remake can do that.This is a dreary reincarnation of a pretty good prison movie wherein Reynolds was very good. Chris Rock and Adam Sandler rely on schtick and the only thing funny are the McDonald's jokes.I was tempted to walk out several times, but kept hoping things would get better - they didn't.It was sooooo predictably bad.Don't waste your money folks!!!!!",6,3,10,30 May 2005
