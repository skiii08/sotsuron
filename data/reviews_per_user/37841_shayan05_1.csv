Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes is back
","Sherlock Holmes a game of shadows...i have been waiting for seeing this movie for a long time, n at last i got the chance. the first movie i found boring in some stages but overall that was not so bad.in fact that movie was good enough to make me look forward to the sequel..Robert Downey Jr. has been developed as Sherlock Holmes,and his chemistry with Jude law is really good to watch and this time they are working together to solve a case which is one of the biggest case Sherlock has ever had.They are now after professor James Moriarty. Jared Harris as professor Moriarty played his character in a nice way and convinced me as a good opponent of Holmes.Rachel McAdam's role as Irene Adler is reduced in this movie. Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza Heron i didn't like as a gypsy women.Stephen Fry shines as Mycroft Holmes Paul Anderson Paul Anderson does quite good as Colonel Sebastian Moran.Kelly Reilly does well in her short role as Mary Watson.this movie is full of actions,,for me i found the action sequences quiet entertaining. the visual effects r great as well but few effects was was of no needs. but what disappoint me is the director Guy Ritchie,he does not do the justice to the characters which are originated by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. he makes me feel like Sherlock Holmes is like a super hero because some deeds of him seems to me quite supernatural. and he has a lot of chances to make this film great but he failed.what so ever, Sherlock Holmes a game of shadow is an entertaining movie and it has a exiting climax n also has a nice ending?",8,3,5,14 August 2012
