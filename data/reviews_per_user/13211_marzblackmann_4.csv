The Avengers," Avengers have assembled!
","After seeing this movie for the 9th time, I guess it's high time that I actually wrote a review of Marvel's Avengers. OK,just letting you know that there MAY be spoilers ahead! Read on at your OWN peril.First, understand that as a comic book fan boy since I was 8,that this was a dream that had finally come true! The Avengers,earth's mightiest heroes had at long last become a film. Let me say,that my only fear was that it wouldn't live up to my expectations and I would be disappointed. Ladies and Gentlemen, it EXCEEDED them.What makes this movie an enjoyable and entertaining experience? Well, you have to begin with the film's director,Joss(the BOSS)Whedon of Firefly,Buffy the vampire,and Serenity fame. You can tell when he scripted this,he has a love and admiration for the iconic characters. He himself,has written for comics too. The man knows his stuff. He knew what the not only the fanboys wanted,but also,those who weren't familiar with comic,NEEDED and that needs was entertainment! The story is a simple one.Nothing complex or deep,but it does it's job.However,it was a classic comic book plot,which I dug! I was impressed with the film's pacing. It didn't make me feel tired or anxious. The visual EFX were fantastic! The CGI on the Hulk,in this film,is the best yet so far!Impressive.The cast! Well,wow!EVERYONE and I do mean EVERYONE,from Downey,Evans,Hamesworth,Ruffalo,Scarjo,Jackson,Renner,and on down just were fantastic. I wished that Hawkeye had a little bit more screen time,but being that he was being mind controlled by Loki(brilliantly played by Tom Hiddleston).Lots of cool action too in this film! OH man!Classic comic book geekiness abound. I mean,we get to see Iron Man vs Thor for heaven's sake!The coolest scene for me,is seeing the big three(Cap,Iron man,and Thor)standing together amid the aftermath of aforementioned battle. The fight between Thor and the Hulk on the Hellicarrier was EPIC too.So,what makes this a film that you should see? Well,honestly,it's a good solid piece of entertainment. NO,it doesn't have the serious realism of the dark knight rises or any deep thought provoking messages,but it's a film that you can take your family to if you want to escape the heat or stress of the day! This movie has a good balance of drama and humor. It kinda does remind me of Indepence Day too. It seems to have that unifying affect drawing together everyone no matter what race,religion or creed.I highly recommend this movie.It's worth the trip.",10,4,9,7 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Wasn't that amazing
","*This review MAY contain spoilers* OK,now that we got that out of the way(because I don't want to anger the 'gods'lol).So, I saw this film over the weekend with a good friend and I must say,as a spider-man fan, I was kinda disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It's OK. I really did enjoy Garfield's interpretation of the noble Peter Parker. He got the whole geeky nerd thing down cold. I loved Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy too.She and Garfield,in my opinion,had GREAT on screen chemistry. I really wished that they could've developed that a little more in the film.The talented Sally fields(Aunt May)and the consistent Martin Sheen(Uncle Ben)were very cool and likable.Denis Leary(capt.Stacy)was I think,spot on for his character as was Ifans(doc Connors/the lizard). The cast worked with what the had script-wise.WHICH WAS THE WEAKEST LINK of the movie. I'm sorry,whomever wrote this,were they not educated in the lore that IS spider-man? Granted,they've got Spidey's wit and humor down,which I loved and wished that Raimi's version would've done more. However,I think they missed out on what makes spider-man one of the coolest creation in the comics. When uncle Ben doesn't say the immortal lines to Peter,'With Great Power,Comes great responsibility'. IT'S like WHAT IN THE HELL?!! Those words become Peter's CROSS to bare that he'd wear FOREVER around his neck.It's his MOTIVATION. The guilt that he he'd carry in his heart of knowing that if would've stopped that robber when he had the chance,his uncle still would be ALIVE today.sheesh. The visuals of the film were GREAT though. I was impressed,better than the 2002's. I did enjoy the kinda darker feel too the film,but I think that too much time was wasted with peter trying to resolve his abandonment issues with his parents.It just made the film,DRAAAAAAAG. Message to Sony execs:If you do decide to do a sequel,which mostly likely will happen, Keep Marc Webb as the director. He's good. Just PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE,a better tighter script.Don't dumb it down. Finally,show some respect for us fans. I know you have a vision,but try to keep the origins,for the most part unchanged,please?OK, so, go see the film,but matin√©e prices. I think,though the 3D(I saw 2D)may be pretty cool with all the webslinging going on.",6,4,8,11 July 2012
Lincoln," Impressive and unforgettable
","I just saw this film yesterday morning and it is DEFINITELY one of the BEST films of the year.LINCOLN is a movie that isn't action packed. It's just filled with great performances that just are so hypnotic and engaging.I have to say,much,like what oliver stone's 'NIXON',it gave me a humanizing affect of the man. I mean,this is a President,who is dealing with So much on his plate:the civil war,still in mourning of the death of a child,his wife is in emotional/mental turmoil,and the whole subject of slavery. He is being pulled in so many different directions.Daniel Day Lewis IS the Laurence Olivia(forgive me if I misspelled his name) of our generation. His portrayal of our nation 16th president is simply INCREDIBLE. The performance so captivating,that you just no longer SEE the actor! Sally Field!Welcome back to a role worthy of your Oscar winning gifts!wow! She is brilliant as Licoln's wife,Marry todd.Tommy LEE JONES..he just is fantastic.Every one,did good with what parts they were given. Thank you Mr.Spielberg,once again,you have proved why you are indeed one of the best directors EVER.It is a well written piece of work,that's for sure. I am not sure about the historical accuracy but still, it's just so impressive.I do encourage you to see this film,but like I said before,there's not any action per se,(much like watching C-span with a bunch of guys in long beards and such.haha)but a beautiful work of art.",10,4,9,19 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises but sadly falls down flat on its face
","Heads up!This review MAY contain spoilers or NOT.OK,the long awaited third installment of Chris Nolan's Batman saga has arrived. I had enjoyed the previous films of the series(Batman Begins and The Dark Knight) so I was really hoping this will be a perfect ending to the franchise. Alas,sadly,I was so disappointed.WHY?! I'll tell you,by gumption WHY! First,the good stuff: The beginning of the film was so cool and compelling. We are introduced to BANE. I tell ya,Tom Hardy,is one of the finest actors I know. He still manages to deliver intimidation with just his eyes and vocal modulation,when you can understand him(MORE ON THAT LATER). The whole scene was just cool with the abduction of the nuclear scientist was fantastic!Really stylish!Hands of to Nolan for that. Anna Hathaway's performance as Selina Kyle(aka CATWOMAN),was superb! She caught me totally off guard.She was witty,funny, and dangerously seductive in this role. Sheesh!She now OWNS this character. I do believe she and J.Gordon Levitt(Officer blake)were some of the cool things about this movie. Christian bale,Michael Cain,and Gary Oldman as always give strong solid performances(two Oscar winners and a nominee,don't worry Gary you're going to get yours soon!). The fight scenes between Bane and Bats were cool. THe first one in particular!It was BRUTAL. I felt an acid of FEAR for the dark knight when he engaged in hand to hand with this behemoth of badness!Good stuff.Alright now for the disappointing stuff. I just can't wrap my brain around the fact that ol' bats 'retired' for 8 years because of the loss of his supposed true love.WTH?! That's not the Batman I know. Him feeling sorry for himself,especially of a woman? AGain I say,WTH?! If anything,the would've thrown him MORE SO into his work of fighting crime,ANY CRIME! Harvey DENT ACT BE DAMNED! Just so out of character. I understand the nolan brothers perhaps wanted to add some 'realism' in the script,but guys,bats ain't REAL.He's a comic book ICON with one of the most richest and fantastic histories.Don't disrespect that.The pacing of the film was slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow. Not to mention when Bane and Bats meet for ROUND TWO in the third act,we find out that Bane was really JUST A HIRED GOON?!!WTH.That kinda deflated his whole bad assness for me!dammit. His death really was disappointing too.sheesh.Like I said I did have high hopes for this film and it's sad to me that it had to end this way. Should you see it?Sure.However,just go with no expectations. Visually the film is impressive for sure!",7,1,3,27 July 2012
