Blade Runner 2049," more and better than expected
","I was prepared to be very disappointed and wound up being not disappointed at all. If it was possible to make a sequel that not only measured up, but enhanced and expounded and expanded on the first Blade Runner (and the VISION of Philip K Dick in his novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'), these hollyweird satanists did it.I try to keep spoilers below down to a minimum and still make the points I want to make...Opening scene: My first question; was the Ryan Gosling character human or replicant? That question is answered fairly quickly into it. That was easy. The rest isn't so easy and that is most welcome by many true sci-fi fans including me.Thirty years on from 2019, replicant creation and programming has gone from a slave trade business to a predominantly trans humanistic onslaught. Won't Gates and Kurzweil be happy. No more individualism. No more imagination. The 'Voight Kampf' test gear used by bounty hunter Deckard in the original is replaced by eyeball scanners the size of a cell phone. I miss the accordian thingy *whatever* that was lol. Of course. Replicants are now diagnosed for aberrations with advanced Neural Linguistic Programming (NLP) debuggers. All the new tech in 2049 ranges from very cool (flying muscle cars from those spinners) to completely evil (the drones and some replicants like Luv).The real story is revealed. Trans humanism, technocracy and AI are subjugating real human life on earth. I mean right now in 2018. What is notably different from the original BR is that free-thinking (and violent) replicants are no longer *banned* from Earth. They are most welcome as long as they can be used by their creator for any nefarious purpose. Replicants are a metaphor for the dead and soulless who walk the earth following their money god into the abyss. May God have mercy on them all.Many reviewers say it drags and/or it's too long. Nonsense. The pauses are the movie! It is meditative. It is quirky. Every time K stares off into space, I wonder what algorithms are running through it's highly advanced AI programming. I guess people forget that 'he' isn't human. Luv is spectacular. What part of her scenes would they cut out or edit? I can't imagine a one-star BR49 reviewer sitting through an Andrei Tarkovsky movie like Solaris or The Sacrifice, Fritz Lang's Metropolis, or even 2001: A Space Odyssey (around 88 dialogue-free minutes in the movie and Rock Hudson walked out LOL) or ANY given cinematic masterpiece; sci-fi or anything else. Most Matrix 'fans' love the first one but frown on Reloaded and Revolutions. As the great sci-fi and speculative fiction writer Harlan Ellison said, 'If you make people think they're thinking, they'll love you. But if you really make them think, they'll hate you.'The only clunky scene, in my opinion, is where the one-eyed replicant leader, Freysa, greets K after he was rescued by Mariette and crew. It seemed very cliche with all the 'terrorist' replicants lurking and then coming out of the shadows. It was good to see McKenzie Davis from Halt and Catch Fire. She looks too good to be a satanist but don't judge a book by it's cover. Freysa has some good lines but the setting was wrong and it seemed contrived.The weather is bleak as hell everywhere not just LA no doubt due to 'chemtrails' (geoengineering or SAI-Stratospheric Atmosphere Injection; see John Brennan former CIA on YT). What was revealed in the first BR is now painfully obvious to some people but not most people.The ending scene with snowflakes on K's hand etc. Snowflakes are a metaphor for INDIVIDUALITY (no two natural snowflakes are alike) vs the robotic mind-control victims of the world. The types of people who are soulless, carbon copies, clones, robots, with thoughtless group hive mind who are susceptible to social engineering and programming. Memories are implanted by the media (like this movie, well there's a recursive irony) much like 'reality' is imbued from infancy and childhood and form behavioral patterns in real life. ALL credit to Philip K Dick aka the master for that.'Reality is such that, when you stop believing in it, it doesn't go away.' 
~ Philip K DickAs the Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright of House of Card's no less. A show made by satanists to reveal their methods) says to K about the soul 'you are doing pretty good without one' meaning most people in real life function without a soul or a connection to God. Some do well, others not so well and it is all the same in the end. It is the parable of the mustard seed in Matthew 13. The robots have no empathy/sympathy for the harm they cause to others much like a Blade Runner has none for those he retires. Lack of sympathy is a trait of psychopathic behavior.The movie benefits from Han's Zimmer's soundtrack; an homage to the original BR soundtrack by Vangelis. It is the conduit to the previous BR and connects the two movies on another more subconscious level.Finally, IMHO, Deckard IS a replicant after all! Here is my reasoning...1. A replicant and human cannot breed. A replicant child was born in BR 2049. Therefore, Deckard is a replicant who breeded with Rachael who was a replicant. In real life, an insect cannot breed with a dog, a bat cannot breed with a turkey, a human cannot breed with a giraffe (I'm sure they've all been tried by now)... it takes similar DNA chromosomes to bear offspring.2. The scene where Freysa tells K to kill Deckard. She lists a number of replicants and Deckard is the first.3. Deckard's first meeting with Rachael is revealed (to me anyway) as an arranged breeding experiment.",9,0,2,17 January 2018
Munich," who are the terrorists?
","This movie doesn't bother with the actually documented history of the BACK STORY involving the PLO, Black September, the Palestinians, the Jordanians, the Zionist Israeli government and it's zombie 'settlers' or what this movie is based on, namely: 'Operation Wrath of God.' For that reason, it's mostly what I would call propaganda and indoctrination. Hey, big surprise.*******-> 'SPOILERS' (I guess if history is to be called that) BELOW: <-*******The hidden truth that is hardly ever told...If there's a shred of truth in Munich (and the reason I give it some stars), it takes place at 45:10 into the movie when Mahmoud Hamshari and his French wife launch into Israel (pun not intended) AND EVERY WORD OF THEIR DIALOGUE IS THE TRUTH. But because Hamshari is targeted as a terrorist and partly responsible for the Munich tragedy (without a trial and no evidence other than Mossad 'intelligence'), EVERY WORD OF THEIR DIALOGUE IS TAKEN AS THE RANTINGS OF TERRORISTS and therefore FALSE by the ignorant masses. It's an old trick that holly wood has been playing for decades; slip in SOME of the truth among the preponderance of lies (omittance) and no one will believe the truth.And there are also shreds of truth at 1:30:00 but much less so because the Arab's prophecy about the short life of Israel is only a dream, unfortunately. The USA (and allies AE) are for Israel. It's all about AIPAC and the Israeli lobby of liars.I don't condone what the PLO did in the 1972 Munich Olympics. That was a mistake. The world didn't know what motivated them (and US news made sure we wouldn't). The PLO were naive to think that it would change anything. Indeed, it only made things worse for Palestinians. But what makes these Mossad agents any better than PLO terrorists or CIA killers or ISIL mercenaries or psychopath cops? Nothing. Not a damn thing. They are the same! They plant bombs. They are sneaky, deceptive and bungling idiots to boot. They kill women and children right through all of Operation Wrath with no discrimination DESPITE what this movie propagandizes as compassion on their part interspersed throughout.Although I lived through Black September and watched the Munich tragedy unfold on TV (along with the lies. TV always has been lies.), I had no idea of what was behind it all. Then the Internet became usable by the average person. Before that, info was censured to all except scholarly types in libraries and we don't know what we don't know.I don't condone what the PLO did in the 1972 Munich Olympics but what I do know is this: Terrorism is and has been the essence of Israel since 1948 and before (see the Nakba or Al Nakbha (Day of Catasrophe) when over the course of a year, 700,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes, their homes destroyed or taken, murdered, women raped all at the hands of armed Israeli thug gangs), and they are guilty of war crimes against humanity for their apartheid treatment and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in what is RIGHTFULLY the indigenous Palestinian land. The Palestinians are willing to cohabit their land with Israeli's but that's not enough for the Zionist Jews of Israel and it's mind-controlled citizens, is it.This movie is blank on Black September.",4,2,5,9 August 2017
