Skyfall," 007 movie ? more like 000 movie
","Before starting my review of this movie a little about my self. when it comes to movies i am easily impressed i am not one of those hardcore every thing must be perfect.When i see 007 on a movie title the first 3 things that comes to my mind is Action, HOT woman, and awesome Gadgets...like in any other 007 movies, but in this one they went on a different road. The first 15 min of the movie made it looked extremely promising. 20 min into the movie I stated to see a different formula for the series.This movie has a lot but a lot of Drama.The entire action scene's in the movie sum up to maybe 40 min of action (the movie is about 2h:40min long), the rest Drama. Every Bond movie has its Hot women, and she has a major impact in the movie, not in this one the hot women in this 007 movie, which is acted by Bérénice Marlohe has no meaning or anything (dont get me wrong she is super HOT but you see her for like 10 min then poof she is gone never to be seen again).Another part of the 007 series are The Gadgets. The gadgets scene is the biggest down fall of this movie if you ask me. I expected to see some creative gadgets and a car with guns on it...not in this movie people. James is being handed A Gun and a small stress Radio gadgets device, and to top it all off they leave you (the watcher) with the cheesiest Line. 'what did you want to get an exploding pen?'....YESSSSSSSS we want to see awesome gadgets at least i did. I read some where that the budget for this movie was around the 200$ mil. I didn't see 200$ mil movie that's for sure.last but not least the acting...which was excellent. Daniel Craig is a very good actor if you ask me and same thing with the rest of the cast, the script is jest BAD!!!!!!",4,29,59,28 October 2012
