Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," *Vomits*
","This is the worst Star Bores movie ever made, I could barely sit through the thing and I could seriously kill the actor who did Jar Jar's voice (shakes fist).George Lucas has completely lost touch with the audience of today, they do not want to see a space movie with a damn plot, they want two hours of lightsabers god damnit.The script and acting were absoultly terrible as was the casting, except for Portman, can't complain there at all (scratches croth). Anyways, the actors should all rot in hell, as well as anyone who thought this movie was worth 9 dollars in theatres or 20 something on DVD. Screw Flanders.",5,0,1,30 July 2003
