The Ring," Adequate ghost story
","Spoilers ahead....
This was an adequate ghost story at best. I thought you had to be pretty much brain dead, once you saw the well, NOT to know that was 'The Ring'.There are far too many plot holes to make it truly creepy. 'My wife wasn't supposed to have a child...' Richard Morgan sez. All right, the daughter is not adopted as stated earlier in the movie. Is she a Demon Seed? What is her motivation for perpetuating her evil? Is she evil for evil's sake? Enquiring minds want to know.This isn't a ghost story that makes you think, it's a ghost story that annoys you. It could have been a lot more but wasn't. If you MUST see this, wait until it comes out on video and save the full price of admission. If you can't wait that long, see it at a matinee. You won't be so hacked off that you wasted your money.",1,2,7,22 November 2002
The Mummy," Campy comedy
","People seem to either love or hate this movie. It is a decent summer flick, and saying that, you ought to know to leave your brains at the door and just enjoy it. No, it's not Indiana Jones, but I don't think it pretended to be. No, it isn't as creepy as Karloff's Mummy. Karloff's Mummy was, surprisingly, a sympathetic character. No, it's not historically accurate, but it doesn't pretend to be a history lesson. It is a comic book come to the screen. But I think it gives a broad nod and wink to those great (cheesey and otherwise) adventure/action flicks of the 30s and 40s.",Null,0,0,20 October 1999
Event Horizon," Bad-bad-bad
","The only thing scary about this movie is that it actually got the funding to make it. A terrible piece of drek that's a rip-off combo of *Alien* and *Hellraisers*. A terrible waste of the casts' considerable talent. If you aren't watching this on a DVD or VCR with the ability to fast forward through many minutes of gratuitous and graphic violence and inane dialogue, a terrible waste of your time.",1,13,27,5 January 2003
