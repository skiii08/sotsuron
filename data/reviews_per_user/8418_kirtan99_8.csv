Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than what people say
","OK so I'm gonna begin by saying it's not the worst Star Wars film.Star Wars episode 2 the attack of the clones is the worst one So let's get into why this movie is good. It has great action It has DARTH MAUL yes he was underused but he is awesome. Liam Neeson is amazing and Ewan mcgreggor is no worse. I don't blame any of The actors for the bad things about the movie. I blame the writer because The actors did their best to act out what was written. the pod racing scene was GREAT BUT THE BAD THINGS WAS JAR JAR BINKS, the underuse of DARTH Maul, and THE AMOUNT OF CGI SERIOUSLY THE ORHINAL TRILOGY LOOKED GOOD BUT GEORGE LUCAS STUPIDLY MADE THIS 90% CGI",6,2,5,15 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," My favourite in the entire series
",I gotta admit I never grew up when Star Wars first came out but It has not changed how much I love this Saga. This episode is one of my favourites. I love the ending but do not prefer the beginning. I wish this had the beginning of episode 4 and had this ending. It is a great introduction to jabba the hut and is an awesome sequel Although not a better one to episode 5 the empire strikes back. Honestly many people hate the ewoks but they are cute and deadly. It Is stupid how they do kill storm troopers by throwing stones and arrows. Seriously consider how stupid and useless their armour is I don't believe stormtroopers are useless because they kill many Rebels and took over the ship at the beginning of episode 4.,9,2,4,15 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The worst of the STAR WARS SAGA
","This movie is terrible form the writing to the CGi action. It has a weak plot That has some problems. Seriously why is padme suddenly a target. Why not any other senator. Seriously and who is the main character. People hate Hayden Cheistiansan but he is great he does angry really well Seriously I blame the writing and Hayden did the best with what he had. Ewan mcgreggor is good and a brilliant OBI WAN. COUNT DOOKU IS GOOD BUT DARTH MAUL SHOULD BE THE Villain. the battle between obi wan, Anikan and DOOKU is meh because it's all poorly executed and the only good part is the scene with the red and blue lights on Anikan and DOOKU. Yodas fight is CGi but good and JANGO FET LOOKS Awesome. the droid factory is Medioka The BEST thing from this movie was the CLONE WARS TELEVISION SERIES THAT DEVELOPED THE CHARACTERS AND MADE ORDER 66 even more emotional.",5,1,9,15 August 2015
Avatar," An Amazing Movie
","The film 'Avatar' (2009) is directed by James Cameron and explores many environmental issues. The film follows Jake Sully, a marine as he learns how to live like a native on the moon Pandora. The military have made a base on Pandora and create Avatars that Jake and other scientists control to live with Na'vi. The film explores how different groups treat the environment and show how it is significant in sustaining life. As the film progresses it shows how all living organisms form some sort of symbiotic relationship. The Na'vi calls the environment and the spirit that controls everything Eywa. Eywa connects every living thing and gives reason to each event. The Na'vi connect to Eywa by some sort of neuron connection. This connection allows them to feel what Eywa feels and connect and understand other organisms. In comparison the Humans destroy the environment and are extremely aggressive. They have no connection to their environment and the environment of others as they destroy whatever they want for their own benefit. The film also explores how an organism's soul is precious and shows that one event has a significant event on another. The film contains many shots that show how beautiful the environment is and uses its CGI to the fullest. The environments are beautiful, lush and glowing with colour. This allows the audience to appreciate the environment more and feel more anger against the humans for destroying it. It causes the audience to think about how this is a reality and humans are in fact destroying the environment. The realistic story explored is strong and catches the viewers' attention from the very beginning. James Cameron does a beautiful job as he makes a simple but compelling story that explores many important environmental issues.",8,2,4,13 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The bets of the preqels
",OK so let's talk about how this is the best of the preqels. It had a great intro and ENDING. honestly it ties to the original Trilogy well and has good acting. It has an amazing score And it has an amazing final few scenes. The battle between Obiwan and Anikan is brilliant and well executed. People complain about the acting but I blame the writer because The actors did their best to act out what was written. It ends the clone wars well but the one thing I hate is Count Dookus Death and The terrible battle between Obi Wan and General Grevious That could have been so much better. Mace window and palpatines battle was terrible because 3 Jedi die really easily.,8,1,2,15 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An Amazing Movie that will inspire the next generation
",The Force Awakens is better than all of the prequel trilogy movies. It has a lot of scenes that are similar to A New Hope. That doesn't effect the movie in a negative manner but boosts the audiences interest in it. The characters are amazing and the reveals are brilliant. They make X wing pilots cool and bring a whole new take on the story that does a great job at continuing the story from the original trilogy. I felt a lot of emotion watching this and am glad that a new generation will be introduced to Star Wars in such an amazing way. I grew up watching the prequel trilogy and it did its job at hooking the next generation on the Star Wars saga. This sequel trilogy will continue to add a new generation to this saga.,8,11,35,17 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This is the best franchise ever
",This is brilliant George Lucas first masterpiece and it does start off with a bang While the lightsaber battle isn't the best. It's story and introduction is perfect. The ending isn't my favourite but i can understand why people Love this movie The one problem I have is how the torpedoes at the end go into The whole when they are shot from the side. I also don't get why they must go through the trench When they could just enter at the end and then fire. This is definitely the weakest of the three because of its ending but It's entrance is the bets of the whole SAGA. If you haven't seen this what are you doing So go out and watch this and rate it. Overall as a trilogy it is better than the prequels.,10,0,3,15 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best in the SAGA
",I gotta admit I never always like Star Wars episode 5 the empire Strikes back. I use to think that it was boring and had too much talking and Information but I grew older and now I study films and notice Why certain things happen and how they make a film better. I will not deny that I am tired of hearing certain scenes but that doesn't happen Often. Honestly if you haven't seen this you must. The only problem I can think Off is the battle between vader and Luke. I want to know why vader didn't kill Luke and what happened to R2. Why did he get dragged down at dagobha What was the point of that scene. The film has a great beginning and a good Ending. Overall as a trilogy it is better than the prequels,10,2,4,15 August 2015
