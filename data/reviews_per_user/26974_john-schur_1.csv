3:10 to Yuma," Unbelievable!
","This movie was unbelievable. And I don't mean that in a good sense. I felt insulted by the ridiculous actions of the characters. Just pain stupid! I was truly amazed by what I saw, given all the hype. While the acting and cinematography were top notch, the story line was just absurd. I haven't seen the original, but I hope it was better. Otherwise, I haven't a clue what would have justified a remake. I would guess this is just another example of Hollywood having run out of original ideas and failing in the attempt to reclaim past glory. Having long ago lost confidence in the Academy Award selection process, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that this film garnered nominations. I consider the two hours spent on this film a complete waste of time.",5,7,10,7 July 2008
