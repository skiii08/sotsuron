The Ring," I could be disappointed of it weren't so 'funny'
","I cannot believe this movie made it past the director, editor, boom operator and test audience. It's what a really bad movie could be, if it tried.The most annoying being the boom mike in almost every other dialogue scene from the beginning.  It was a constant reminder I was watching a show. I could have watched it in a barn with horses.  Two that stick out prominently in my head are: The entire boom 'arm', mike and cord in the upper right corner in the scene where Rachel leaves Noah's apt the first time and is standing by the elevator discussing poo-poo drivel.  The other goofy use of the mike is in the scene where Rachel interviews wacko at the insane asylum. Not only can you see the mike you can watch it go back and forth from wacko to Rachel during their talk.    Stink-o. The frames of the solo face shots cut off the chins in a not-art-film way and the love for her son was about a genuine as a frog and a rock.   The up side was the kid was the best part. He was a little creepy but endearing and I appreciated the dull overall color to add to the mood. Otherwise, maybe the 'deleted' scenes that some say there are would explain the confusing David Lynch attempt they were going for. And for the love of all that is holy how did they or ANYONE miss that mike at the top of the screen. The entire theatre was laughing at it here. There was even after movie chit chat and a cheer when the boom operators name went by.  P U",1,3,9,15 November 2002
