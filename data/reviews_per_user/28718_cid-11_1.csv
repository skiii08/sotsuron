The Blair Witch Project," Original but not frightening
","The movie was quite original in its making, not the high budget special effects or multi-million dollar stars. The actors truly conveyed a feeling of terror. The concept was also quite appealing. Nonetheless, the movie was not frightening. I did leave the movie theater a little dizzy from the constant camera movements. The movie gets a 3 out of 4 stars for originality and acting, but only a 2 as a horror movie.",Null,0,0,22 August 1999
