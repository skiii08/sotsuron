Howl's Moving Castle," A liitle review from this beautiful movie
","The film is named Howl's Moving Castle. It's a Japanese animated film from the year 2004. It was written by Hayao Miyazaki; he also directed the film. The film is based on the novel with the same name, written in 1986 by British author Diana Wynne Jones.The story is set in a fantasy kingdom with magic and 20th century technology. It tells about a girl named Sophie. She works in a small shop. One day a witch enters the shop and curse her into an old woman. So she escapes from the city ans encounters a wizard named Howl. He has a castle, but it's a very special castle. It has mechanism that lets it wander around, so the location always changes. Together with the wizard Sophie experience exciting adventures. Of course, she hopes that the wizard could disband the curse: that is one of the reasons why she follows the wizard. And at home, no-one would recognize her, or they would have been scared of her and who knows what they would have done to her.I chose this movie, because it has a deep meaning that gets clear while you're watching the movie. The film shows many facets. It contains strong anti-war themes, influenced by Miyazaki or to be more precise, the whole movie is influenced by Miyazaki's life. In an interview, he explained his love of flying and said that he used to like playing with army planes. But later he also developed a hatred for it. Since these were created to bring destruction. Even that the film is a fantasy story and animated, it is very realistic, except for the magic. Howl's Moving Castle is a very beautiful story that is made for children but also for adults. A perfect film for the whole family.",9,1,1,22 October 2019
