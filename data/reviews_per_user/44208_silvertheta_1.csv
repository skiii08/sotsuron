Mission: Impossible III," part 4 needs to be done
","MI usually has a great set of characters, scenes, action, some comedy and of course the sneaky spy stuff. MI3 has lots of action but some of the meanings in some actions were lacking logic. I felt I was being jumbled around. And there wasn't enough theme song played in the movie. Ethan Hunt should have been on vacation in the opening part, as a reminder of the vacation comments from the last MI, that would have made some good humor. More gadgets should have been used. I think the bridge scene was great and very clever with opening the truck. Tom running through the village boardwalk at super speed gave an incredible no special effects performance. But I lost some of my personal fun connection with this one. John Woo did a fantastic job on them before. He needs to be directing again. Part 4 needs to be made.",6,0,0,5 June 2006
