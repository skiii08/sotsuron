Skyfall," 007 fell out of sky and hit and crashed
","I went into this movie with high expectations thanks to all the rave reviews labeling it as the best Bond movie ever. Oh boy was I lied to or what?! This is simply the most disappointing and mediocre bond movie since Sean C was a young man with painted eyebrows. At least back then we had interesting sci-fi weapons, like tech cars, mad sharks, over-powerful villain sidekick, cutting hats, etc. Then we get Skyfall: Plot - it goes like this - good guys got screwed, good guys fight back, then got screwed again, then we go to farm, bond finish. The plot is so mediocre that I thought I was watching a different movie until Daniel Craig made clear his name is Bond.Acting - it looked like DC is on some medication because his hair and his composure seem chemical. Granted he is not getting younger but I can easily tell this Bond is on roids, painkiller and Ritalin. Ralph Fiennes probably slept thru his role and Judi Dench I will mention below on a new category for her. The new tech is a model from Zara/Top shop. Saving grace is Javier, the sole star carrying the entire work load on his shoulders.Bond girl - now how can we have a Bond movie without P-galore? Or some memorable Bond girls like Halle Berry, Michelle Yeoh, etc. No! This round the true Bond girl is Judi Dench, yes, believe. Thankfully there is no s-scene between her and 007. Enough said.Action - there is still plenty action, but Daniel is no longer the same from CasinoR and QuantumOS. Try picture the Invictus Eastwood trying to act Jet Li, yes, that difficult to watch.Direction - BIG Problem - if you think American Beauty and Road to redemption could ever have a deformed incest baby, this is the One. I am a big Sam fan, but in this movie at times actors seemed lost in their own scenes, as if the camera is not relative to what it was shooting at - Bond is busy working but Director is treating it like gallery day job. You just can not get art-sy if it's a bad guy chase.However, given the big budget, the movie manages to pull off a coherent overall feel, largely thanks to fine editing, thus my 5 of 10.Overall, one can not help but feel sorry for Daniel Bond, a sadness reserved for watching the decline of Great Britain from its former glory, like walking into an antique yard sell only to realize the toys you used to worship are now worth 2 dollars.",5,3,8,12 February 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Apes rise honorably in a reboot
","I did not watch the original Apes-series of movies from the old times. This is my first Ape contact since the Tim Burton big-budget flick a few years ago. So I was totally not prepared for the tour-de-force it provided. I slept thru the recent superhero/big-budget movies ie green lantern, xmen first class, pirates4, capt American, etc, because those movies lacked something crucial to a movie, which is plot development. Rise-Apes went the opposite direction: it did not totally have a dead villain ending; it is all about development; the CGI was spot-on and not massively done. It feels more like an art house than a commercial movie with emotions filling admirably for explosions--yes the emotional explosions in this movie are as often as bombings in a Michael Bay film. The flaw is that at times it feels like an extended intro into a possible new series of Apes franchise, which smelled cheesy. And the lead baddie does not feel like a baddie given current global economy. There is absolutely zero spark on the romance between the lead guy and his Indian girlfriend--I could not notice a kiss (if you think you saw one, keep it, it's a collectable item). Overall this is a great movie and so far the best from those action flicks above. We are so going to see sequels after this film. EZ",Null,0,1,17 August 2011
