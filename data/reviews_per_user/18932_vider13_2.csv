Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat, Ali G, Sacha Baron Cohen to much but we want more.
","Borat is wonderful; he knows where he's going not that we do in any of his short flicks. Truly a master of comedy in his own right with more than just a cult following. To understand him is to begin to know him. Someone to follow, someone who's unique. Get a hold of Borat when he returns to HBO with his cast of characters. If your quick and you understand the German language you can here Borat or Ali G as we know him use terms such as 'Juden' when his guest show signs of anti-Semitism. His bang on being 'Gay' offends all the right people. High scholars, professionals and grandparents are enjoying 'Cohen' and for good reason.Manny Vider, Dix Hills,NY Email: Vider13@aol.com",10,28,132,2 January 2006
Munich," 'I prefer the world's criticism rather than their condolences'
","Steven Spielberg's brings to the screen not only a difficult episode but also a reminder to all, that terrorists will kill anyone anywhere in order to obtain a platform from where they can justify their acts of insanity. The murders of innocent Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic games could have been avoided if the German authorities honored the request of the Israeli Government to rescue their own citizens. The hosting German Government did not even have a S.W.A.T team or even so much as a team of police sharp shooters as part of their police force. How could the German hosts think that they would be able to handle such an act of madness brought on by Black September? Golda Meir put it simply when it came to the security of Israel and its citizens, she stated 'I prefer the world's criticism rather than their condolences' Enter the Mossad and it's ability to deal with terrorism anywhere in the world. Spielberg's direction of the film is fast paced and thought provoking. Those know and unknown actors bring you to the edge of your seat. I can only comment that the Mossad's handling of those that were sought for there involvement in the Munich massacre were dealt with less confusion than depicted in the movie. Mossad's in a sense was depicted as having handled the hostile targets as a group of Keystone Cops, how far from the truth. Why the Mossad was presented in such a manner is baffling.
