The New World," A very, very mixed bag.
","Okay, let's see here:The good: Amazing acting. The bad: Little dialogue and long gazes gets old...fast.The good: Gorgeous shots of nature and wonderful cinematography. The bad: There's no one shot that lasts longer than ten seconds, and I'm being generous there, so it becomes a constant reminder that you're watching a movie. 'Oh wow, look at great camera angle and that evokes just the right- Wait, it's gone.'The good: The story, as a whole, has the potential to be powerful, moving, and evocative. The bad: The long winded style of film-making drags out an hour and forty five minute story to two and a half hours.The good: What little lines are spoken are thoughtful and poetic. The bad: Virtually all of the lines spoken are voice overs to show what the character is thinking and it gets old after a while.When I walked into the room and saw that this was on, I was intrigued at first, mesmerized by the subtle performances and how John Smith and Pochahontas were delicately interacting with each other....then it just kept going....and going....With huge chunks of time passing in a single moment but with no indication so by the time you've figured out what's going on something else has happened or some character has realized something vitally important.A+ for effort, D for actual quality.",5,1,6,3 March 2007
Star Trek," Wow, I'd forgotten how much I love Star Trek
","This is quite possibly the best 'reboot' a franchise has ever gotten. I hadn't watched anything Star Trek in so long that I'd forgotten how much I loved the universe and the characters in it, and this movie definitely reminded me. The dialogue is wonderful, the acting is right where it needs to be, and the direction was another hit out of the park by JJ. I literally have no complaints. It's both an action AND story packed 2 hours that is so massive and enthralling it left my head spinning (and a movie hasn't done that to me in years). Even if you're not a Trekkie, GO SEE IT. This could very well change your mind.",10,3,11,9 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Every bit as amazing as I hoped
","I had a feeling from the moment I saw the full trailer that PotC: DMC was going to be incredible, so I went in with very high hopes (and very excited to boot), and I was not disappointed. It had more of everything I loved in the first one, with stunning scene after stunning scene for my eyes to feast on. I seriously felt like I was in Heaven. The acting is at the same level as the first one (with another great performance by Depp, naturally) which suits me just fine since I can accept that Bloom isn't the greatest actor in the world, but it wasn't the worst performance in history so it's easily overlooked. This soared to such great heights that I'm seriously wondering how they can top it for the third movie, At World's End. I mean, how can you get more swashbuckling action, stellar visuals, and great performances into 2 and 1/2 hours? If you're a fan of the first film, you won't be disappointed, it's all the greatness of CotBP and more. Out of XMen 3 and Superman Returns, Pirates is my favorite movie of the summer (and I seriously loved XMen and Superman, too). Next summer can't get here fast enough. 10/10",10,2,4,8 July 2006
Cloverfield," I haven't been this tense in a movie theater in sooooo long
","With all of the crazy viral marketing (that started way too early) some people were worried if it could live up to the hype. It COMPLETELY surpassed my expectations, and I went in expecting it to be good in the first place. Once things pick up and start rolling about 15 minutes in, I didn't relax until the credits started rolling. Yes, they give you a few brief moments to catch your breath, but even then you're still on edge, waiting for the next attack. I can't imagine this movie being executed in any way other than the hand held approach. They somehow managed to pull off SEVERAL absolutely beautiful shots/camera angles while still fitting into the hand held setting. The acting and dialog is so natural that it doesn't feel like they're acting a script...at ALL. It's incredibly intense, you're really pulled into the character's corners, and it's filmed wondrously. If you get motion sickness easily, you'll probably want to wait 'till this is out on DVD. Other than that...GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It's one of the greatest monster movies of all time. Actually...scratch that...it's THE greatest monster movie of all time.",10,281,539,26 January 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Nothing can prepare you
","Speaking as an avid fan of the show and all of the major players involved with movie, this is the greatest musical adaptation. Period. It's faithful to the original work, only making cuts and trims where it's necessary, and captures the essence of the show and the many dynamics and layers that go with it. This show is no picnic. They don't call it the most difficult musical ever for no reason. To pull off a movie adaptation of this show even remotely well can be considered an accomplishment. To equal, and in some ways surpass, the greatness of the original work is unheard of, and it happens with Burton's Sweeney Todd. I can't sing this movie's praises enough (pun half intended). Fans of the Broadway show will be happy, fans of Burton will be happy, fans of Depp will be happy, fans of Carter will be happy, even fans of Sascha Baron Cohen will be happy. Burton somehow pulled it all off, with the help of a stellar cast and Oscar caliber technical staff. No, I'm not exaggerating in this review. The only excuse you have for not seeing this movie is if you're super squeamish about blood (even then the blood is pretty artistic and over the top, but not too much so) or you simply don't like dark material...and let me just say that you'd be hard pressed to find darker subject matter.A little NOTE to FANS OF THE SHOW: The first time you see this, don't be surprised if it flies by really fast. This happened to me, and I realized that it was probably because I wasn't used to a lot of the songs being trimmed and such. The second time I saw the pace felt MUCH slower and more coherent.",10,11,20,21 December 2007
Burn After Reading," Stupid people do stupid things and get in over their head. Yup, it's a Coen film.
","-MINOR and VAGUE spoilers-Burn After Reading is Fargo without the snow and wood chipper. Someone stupid does something stupid and gets other people killed for absolutely NO reason, and it all leads to a literally non-existent ending. Even though the ride has it's high points and keeps you interested, it goes positively nowhere, leaving the viewer with a well-that-was-fun-but-pointless feeling. Even a character in the MOVIE said that nobody learned anything. But wait, it's a Coen brothers film, which means it must be gold.If you're a Coen brother fan, you probably won't be disappointed. If you're not, Burn After Reading will not convert you.",3,22,47,12 September 2008
"I, Robot"," A nice surprise with a mediocre final three minutes.
","I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. Will Smith (while not 100% perfect for the part) performed very well, the script was pretty tight with only a couple of 'misses' as far as humor attempts were concerned, the graphics were gorgeous, the action was very well filmed, and the story kept me interested. I'd give I Robot a nine, but the last three minutes were a pretty big let down. It's like the writer suddenly went retarded and gave every character something stupid/cheesy to say. Put that with the sappy music and characters looking out over a dawning city, and you get a letdown of an ending. Rent it before you buy it. I bought it.",8,0,1,21 January 2007
Saw III," My expectations were met to the nth degree.
","While they stepped up on the gore a bit, it's still the same Saw we know and love. This is one of my favorite trilogies ever, with every entry being just as strong (if not stronger) as the one before it. YOu get everything with the third installment: Gore, story, acting, creativity, and one hell of an ending. Every Saw film had me covering my mouth, my eyes wide with shock at the twist(s), and this one delivers just as superbly as the other two. Fans of Saw will LOVE this one. If you're not already a fan of the first two, however, I doubt this one will change your mind, as it's hardly a departure from the previous two movies. If anything, it embraces what it is even more.",10,1,3,27 October 2006
The Dark Knight," If you're doubting that TDK will live up to the crazy hype, don't.
","It's very, very rare that a movie sooooo incredibly hyped up actually meets expectations, and The Dark Knight proved to be a rarity. Masterfully directed, superbly acted (there is no justice in this world if Ledger doesn't posthumously win the Oscar for Best Supporting), beautifully shot, expertly crafted...there's just flat out nothing wrong with The Dark Knight. The film takes the first half to gloriously sink it's claws into you, and the second half holding on until the very last moment. Absolutely brilliant, and 100% deserving of every scrap of praise it receives. As for every single other summer movie that comes out in the future: Take notes. This is how you do it.",10,1,4,18 July 2008
The Departed," One of the best films this year, despite a couple of flaws.
","Acting: Top notch. Everyone involved gives a top caliber performance and, let me just say, it's so good to see Nicholson being the crazy badass we all know and love again. Even though Baldwin doesn't have much screen time, he steals the show with almost all of his lines.Dialogue: I cracked up more than once, and I felt myself barely breathing the rest of the time. It went from darkly humorous to riveting in a flash, and did so brilliantly.Story: I gasped more than once during the ending, if that's any inclination. This movie's long, but it more than held my interest the entire time so I'm not complaining.So why didn't I give The Departed a ten? It was held back from true greatness by shoddy editing (I noticed at least ten inconsistencies, and I'm sure there were more that I missed since I was so entertained) and a very serious flow problem. It jumped from scene to scene so quickly that I found myself confused a decent part of the time, especially in the beginning, and a good portion of scenes were completely useless. For example, there's a one minute long scene of Nicholson's character throwing crack on a bed and telling a hooker to snort it 'till she's numb that comes out of nowhere, and disappears just as quickly. You could say it was to show how screwed up his character was but, trust me, there was plenty of whacked out crap to serve as proof of the villain's madness, so the scene was useless.Despite its flaws, though, it shouldn't be missed. Scorsese does it again with this brutal, dark caper that keeps you guessing up until the end. You'll laugh, you'll jump, and you'll have to pick your jaw up off the floor. There's one scene in particular, centering around a cell phone 'conversation' in which nothing is said and both characters stare at the phone, simply thinking. If the actors weren't as brilliant as they are, it'd be a waste, but their talent lets you practically be able to read their minds. Simply brilliant.If you're a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Scorsese, Martin Sheen, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg or Alec Baldwin, GO SEE THIS MOVIE.",9,2,4,8 October 2006
Beowulf," Wahhhhhh, you can't have style AND substance, it's just not possible!
","Nobody seems to think that a movie can look good and have substance, so when a visually stunning movie comes along there's all of these people that whine about how its all flash, no substance no matter how much substance there actually IS ::cough:: Sin City, 300 ::Cough:: Beowulf is full to the brim of visual goodness, and its also full to the brim with mature, intelligent themes and a wonderfully complex not-so-typical lead character. This is by no means sugar coated in any way, and pushes its PG-13 rating pretty close to the breaking point. I love that they didn't make Beowulf some uber sexy thing that the girls would swoon over, instead we got a physique that fit the character instead of played off women's fantasies of a swashbuckling romance novel hero. I've read some comments that the movie 'drags' in some places, which simply isn't true if you're actually listening to what going on and not just waiting for the next action sequence. Apparently if nobody is bleeding, the movie is dragging...ugh. I've also read comments that the eyes are 'lifeless.' I must have been watching a different movie, because the emotion held in each character's eyes was pretty dang flawless, definitely not wooden.Long story short: Come for the visuals, stay for the story.",9,3,9,18 November 2007
300," The standard for both art and 'badass' films has just been shattered
","There's hardly words to describe the monumental achievement that is 300. EVERY SINGLE FRAME is a piece of art worth hanging in prominent display at a museum. The ultraviolent, heightened reality that you're (not just drawn but) sucked into demands your attention and never lets you catch a break. The story itself is fairly simple but effective and amazingly executed. The acting fits right in with the surroundings, dead serious, heavy, intense, and passionate. GERARD BUTLER delivers a performance with so much gravity that your eyes are riveted to him for every second he's on screen. He radiates authority, brutality, intelligence, power, royalty, humanity, and so much more. If he doesn't get the (long overdue) attention he deserves, I'll be forced to throw something. No amount of praise could do this film justice. Even the CREDITS are a work of artistic genius. Don't run, dive into theaters. 300 has to be seen to be believed.",10,3,10,9 March 2007
Pocahontas," I forgot just how beautiful this movie is...why is it so underrated??
","I haven't watched Pocahontas in maybe ten years, but I was feeling nostalgic one day and popped it in. I could not believe how truly BEAUTIFUL this movie is, in every aspect. MUSIC: Aside from the songs everyone knows (Just Around the River Bend and Colors of the Wind) every single other song in the film is wonderful, with soaring harmonies and Broadway quality singing. Everything was masterfully written and executed. The music alone is reason enough for this to be adapted into a full out Broadway musical, but don't worry...the music is brilliant but it doesn't scream 'MUSICAL!' like Hairspray or Mamma Mia.ANIMATION: Drop. Dead. Gorgeous. Every single frame is such wonderful eye candy, and the camera work serves the sweeping storyline extremely well.STORY: Dramatic (with it's humorous moments of course), romantic, and it carries a very important message of peace, maturity, and fighting against ignorance and prejudice from BOTH sides. This is possibly the Disney movie with the greatest message for kids.HISTORIC ACCURACY: Yes, Disney changed the true story quite a bit, but if you look to Disney for accurate re-tellings of historical events you have a serious PROBLEM. This movie is more 'Inspired by' than 'Based on' and since the true story is about a 13-14 year old falling in love with 30-40 year I think we can all appreciate that they took some liberties with a KIDS' MOVIE.All in all, I really don't get why this isn't revered as a classic right along with The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.",10,82,105,19 March 2009
Atonement," One of the best films in the past decade, hands down
","Atonement has everything: Drama, romance, stunning visuals, tragedy, compelling storyline...it's all here.Acting: Everyone was on top of their game, but the real scene stealer here is James McAvoy. He deserves every ounce of praise he will inevitably receive for this performance...no kidding. Keira Knightley pulls off a riveting performance, but nothing as eye popping as McAvoy.Story: It simply has to be experienced to be understood. You won't know the whole story or feel the full impact until the credits roll, it's that solid.Visuals: More proof that you can have a deep story AND lush, rich visuals, not to mention some truly stellar cinematography. There's one really long shot in particular that is just overwhelmingly beautiful but incredibly tragic at the same time.The more I think about this movie, the more I love it. I will definitely be seeing this again. Atonement is a serious contender for every Best Picture award out there, and rightfully so. The only NEGATIVE things I have to say about it is that the music is a little too much in a couple of spots, it drags a little in one particular spot, and they make a time jump a little too quickly so it's a bit jarring, but those problems are nit picks and hardly worth mentioning.This could very well be another movie where it's okay for men to cry too.",9,10,18,7 December 2007
V for Vendetta," It just doesn't know what it is.
","All five of the stars I gave it go to Hugo Weaving for making the best out of a bad situation. This movie has multiple personalities, jumping from thrilling to slap stick in a heartbeat, which is probably because the man who took on the massive project has never directed anything before, and it shows. A lot. The dialogue is, well, bad. It's embarrassing at times, actually. The mask V wears the whole time, along with the hair cut, is down right creepy and, while the creepiness decreases as the movie chugs along, it never really goes away. VfV had me rolling my eyes at more than one point, raising my eyebrow once, and almost laughing about three times. If you can take a hero who's shown cooking eggs in a pink apron seriously, then you might be able to get through this.",5,10,19,16 September 2006
