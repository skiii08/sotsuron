The Ring," My lord, this was quite possibly one of the greatest horror movies ever.
","My lord, this was quite possibly one of the greatest horror movies ever. This isn't some gory crap like House of 1,000 Corpes, oh no. This is a mental-type movie. It doesn't show you how people are physically damaged when killed, and so there are so very many ways your mind can perceive based on their corpses. I love this movie, and was straight up terrified. Of course, if your all into gore and don't have an imaginative mind, then this is not for you.The terror of not being able to see your enemy is played up in this, which I like. You never really see Samara, except in the hospital and at the end, but you see her effects, and such things are scary to me. And the sense of lack of time is something that also adds a suspenseful feeling. It's one of those things where you really are hoping and praying for the hero or heroine before time is up. And of course, kudos to the ending. I must say I was not expecting that. And the ending makes you think...or at least...it did until they made a sequel, which I have yet to see but am still disappointed. Of course, I won't give away the ending, but I will tell you that if your mind works like mine, you'll be thinking about the future of Rachel.On the downside, the beginning was fudged up. How would anyone know about the tape if they haven't watched it? Doesn't everyone die after watching it? And of course, THEY MADE A SEQUEL! Other than that, I was totally impressed and terrified by this movie. 9 outta 10.",9,0,1,7 August 2005
The Village," Disappointing, Shyamalan.
","Normally, I'm impressed with Shyamaln's work. Unbreakable was good and Signs was good. Sixth Sense was pretty good too. But The Village just turned out to be a piece of crap. I mean, come on! How can you have a trailer that good and have something that sucked so bad? For an M. Night Shyamalan film, this was disappointing.On a brighter note, the plot was creepy and when someone entered the woods, the sound effects and whatnot were very scary. And when you only see that little bit of the monsters, they were also scary. However, when you see the full Monte of them, they look like something taken from Power Rangers. I half expected them to grow gigantic and shoot eye beams at the village. And while the plot was creepy, it was overall weak and in some cases pointless. All in all: not impressive. 4 outta 10.",4,0,1,7 August 2005
Alien vs. Predator," Half-decent. Good action and special effects, but @$$ acting.
","Not a bad work. The special effects are thrilling, and the action borderlines intense, but the acting is crap. And the fact that two of the(will not list what species) are killed in the same scene was dumb. It's not very Alien versus Predator, if two of the (will not list what species) die back-to-back.I did like the idea of a pyramid in Antartica, but to have it under the ice blows chunks, and the movie takes to long to pick up. Sure there's a snippet or two here and there of a Predator ship, but other wise, no extraterrestrial action until later on. The plot is mediocre and full of holes, and, as aforementioned, the acting is poor, and when coupled with your aunt's constant jawing about what this person or that person should be doing, you've got yourself a heaping platter of man-speak that will drive you insane. If you know of someone who won't shut up during a movie about the characters and their actions, do not watch this movie with that person.On a positive note, as I have already said, the fight scenes are really cool, and the Predators and Aliens look much better than they used to. The movie also features really nifty camera angles that make for cool shots. And of course, the last battle between Predator and Alien features potentially the coolest action shot ever (but I'll let you see for yourself). So, in short, decent with good special effects but poor acting. 6 outta 10.",6,2,4,7 August 2005
