Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Explanation that Eclipses Brilliant Vol. 1
","The second half of this gigantic homage collage piece turns out to serve as an explanation for the unrevealed background of Vol. 1. In many cases, unresolved mysteries hold the viewers' interests by making them keep guessing, while resolutions are rarely satisfying. Kill Bill is no exception; the plain excuse for The Massacre at Twin Pines even eclipses the brilliant Vol. 1. The odyssey of Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) concludes with the poorly executed family drama, where Thurman and David Carradine seem totally lost. Extreme close-ups (of both characters' faces and objects) look cliched and lose their impact when overused.The four-hour epic (combining Vol. 1 and 2) may be more suitable for TV; each chapter has a decent content to comprise a decent series.",5,0,1,27 May 2004
Ali," Surprisingly Quiet, Slow, even Dull
","Surprisingly quiet, slow, even dull biopic for such an aggressive, passionate, and charismatic athlete/historic figure. Probably Michael Mann intended to demystify Muhammad Ali; still I would appreciate if it were more fast-paced, more visually vivid, and more emotionally intense.While well-crafted cinematography seems over calculated at times, improvisational editing in the boxing game scenes properly recreates the jazzy atmosphere of the historic moments. Will Smith could have done better job on the boxing realization, according to my boxer pal.",6,25,44,7 September 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Entertaining Crime Story in Good Ol' Days Fashion
","Nostalgic crime story which was possible only before the days ofcomputational control. Notable male bonds between the chaserand the chased may have been rare in Hollywood tradition andmay be influenced from French gangster films such as Melville's.John Williams did a phenomenal job with his versatility, includingthe post free jazz-ish opening theme and the post minimal-esqueending theme. The opening title with sophisticated animation isone of the best in the film history.",6,0,3,24 June 2003
The Ring," Hollywood Polishes Japanese Inexpensive Original
","This American remake of a Japanese inexpensive but ambitious horror, Ringu, shows what Hollywood can do in order to give a film production a better surface. The U.S. version, The Ring, arguably has a better content of the cursed videotape, with an apparent influence from the surrealism. The viewers may be more easily identified with The Ring's Noah (Martin Henderson), who is skeptical about supernatural phenomena, than with Ringu's Ryoji (Hiroyuki Sanada), who possesses an ESP. In The Ring, the protagonist's son Aidan (David Dorfman) has more significant role, in both storytelling and creating the atmosphere (wearing the archetypical Hollywood's horror-flick makeup), than the Japanese counterpart does. Several details added in the American version (e.g., a horse jumping into the sea from a ferry) deepen the backdrop, while the post-production that manipulates the pictures into a blue tone generates a chilly mood. Overall, in this case, what Hollywood offers works, resulting in making a more polished entertainment.",6,0,1,15 September 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Typical American Mainstream Cinema in the Early 80s
","This adventure flick, which mixes the Western movie formula and special effects in their infant days, represents the American mainstream cinema in the early 80s in many ways. The protagonist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a scholar and an action hero; this combination is unique but the uniqueness has nothing to do with the character development and seems to be the result of the filmmakers' thoughtless decision. The portrayal of the heroine Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is also inconsistent; sometimes she is tough and independent, while frail and dependent on Indiana Jones in the other times. Along with a dragging optimistic story, overly stretched action scenes may be beyond the audience's attention span. The Reaganomix overshadows the plot, where the Americans can do whatever they want in foreign places (South America, Nepal, and Cairo). The sets of Nepal and Cairo look nothing but sets, while John Williams' score, with a catchy melody line by brilliant brass in the Late Romanticism taste, annoyingly accentuates every single action.",3,79,164,19 July 2004
Minority Report," Good Adaptation of Philip K. Dick's Nightmarish World
","SPOILERS INCLUDEDPhilip K. Dick's sci-fi novels essentially reflect the contemporary world, no matter what futuristic gadgets he uses. As if his characters were living in our era, we can easily relate ourselves to them who struggle to fix what is going wrong. For the realization of the Dick world as a mirror of the contemporary society, Minority Report did a better job than glossy Blade Runner did.There seems to be a logical contradiction in the plot, but it is usual for Dick's setting and the filmmakers must have been aware of it. It is impossible for Director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) to design a murder that Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) will commit in the future, while the only reason Anderton will commit is that he witnesses his own future murder and is driven to discover why he will. This chicken-and-egg problem suggests the fragility of reality, one of Dick's long-lasting themes.With craftsmanship Steven Spielberg seamlessly takes in Hollywood cinema's package requirements, such as elements of action flicks and flashy sci-fi movies. Stoicism might have worked better to respect P. K. Dick, but it may be too much to ask Hollywood. Spielberg has a strange habit to mysteriously leave some avoidable blemishes. For example, why do Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith) and Anderton kiss, when she informs him of the minority report? It is completely out of the blue. Also, why does Dr. Solomon Eddie (Peter Stormare), who replaces Anderton's eyes, have to be a jerk like a stereotypical underground doctor in a comic book?The picture with blue-ish hard tone and intense brightness contrast, which is probably manipulated through the postproduction, is appropriately futuristic and unforgettably unique.",7,1,2,18 March 2004
12 Angry Men," Intense Psychological Drama with Faith and Doubt to the Jury System
","(Possible Spoilers Included)In this acclaimed classic courtroom film, a simple one-room setting creates an unbelievably intense psychological drama. The screenplay takes full advantage of the jury system; 12 jurors' personalities are incredibly diverse (though to the contemporary audience they are too homogeneous regarding race and gender); tugs-of-war among them take place in various forms (such as one-on-one, a group vs. a group, and one vs. the rest); and the group dynamics keep changing (e.g., a person on one side comes to be on the other). The process that one juror's initiation upsets the presupposed verdict suggests that the filmmakers have both faith and doubt to the jury system. Without the system, one judge's decision would never be based on anything similar to 12 jurors' varied perspectives, which in the film's case lead the verdict of not guilty. At the same time, the film portrays the arbitrary nature of the system; nothing but a chance brings Henry Fonda's Juror #8, who is the only one to believe the defendant is innocent at the beginning, to the jury.",6,1,5,30 May 2004
Ed Wood," Outstanding Film about Love of Filmmaking
","When Tim Burton picked up an ordinary theme (for him) - drama about life's up and down, his idiosyncratic aesthetics had to choose an extraordinary figure - Ed Wood, C-graded filmmaker in 1950s. Burton must've been confident enough to make such an outstanding film, while picking up Ed Wood as a material might've needed some courage. Through this homage to numerous 'mediocre' films which have been buried in the film history and numerous 'bad' filmmakers who have supported the film industry, Burton's love for filmmaking permeates on the beautifully shot black and white screen. Unquestionably one of the best films about filmmaker/filmmaking, as well as a human drama.",8,0,0,9 July 2003
Snatch," Typical Post-Tarantino Pop and Flashy Heist Comedy
","And a specimen of how to satisfy Gen X and the younger: parallel and occasionally non-linear stories, blend of violence and humor, extremely angled pictures. Guy Ritchie's (and his editor Jon Harris') signature MTVesque-super-fast editing is admittedly noteworthy but tacky.",6,0,1,7 September 2003
Alien," Simplicity in Storytelling and Art Direction Makes the Film Timeless
","The very reason of the huge and continuing success of this 25-year-old sci-fi classic may be the simplicity in its storytelling and its art direction, which has seemingly made the film timeless and universal.A simple And-Then-There-Were-None type of story has no era-related influence from the late 70s, while many sci-fi films tend to mirror the world at the time they are made. Staged mostly in a closed environment inside a spaceship and briefly on an unknown planet far from Earth, the film practically has no connection to any particular culture.The designs of aliens' colony on the planet and of the alien by H. R. Giger must have been remarkably cutting-edge back in the time; for contemporary eyes, they look rather simply beautiful. The title design at the opening is also appropriately simple: Green LED-like lights turn on one by one to form the letters of 'ALIEN.'The film doesn't look old at all after 25 years and probably will never do. This is one of great examples that simplicity attains eternity.",6,11,19,31 January 2005
Taxi Driver," Young and Ambitious Film, Everyone's Commitment Made It a Masterpiece
","In his early masterpiece, Martin Scorsese demonstrates his talent to capture the atmosphere of one region in one era, New York City in the 70s through working class' point of view, while leaving his own recognizable signature: the unpredictable and slightly confusing storytelling to yield both reality and eccentricity simultaneously.Everyone involved, including young Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, Jodie Foster in her teenage, rising cinematographer Michael Chapman, and veteran film composer Bernard Herrmann, seems to have committed, believing that this young, ambitious, and promising film would become a masterpiece. Herrmann's rare, moody and jazzy score became his swansong; his having passed away before the film's theatrical release symbolizes the end of one era of American film.",8,0,1,11 March 2004
Lost in Translation," Sexless, Vulnerable, Extraordinary Intimacy
","A couple distills, develops and preserves an extraordinary intimacy with their unspoken but deliberate and determinate decision of not having sex. For grownups who have learned how to handle sex, emotion, and relationship, this sexless intimacy may be possible only conditionally. In the case of Lost in Translation, Scarlett Johansson's innocence and Bill Murray's sense of lost snowballs untouchable vulnerability between their interactions. It's fairytale-ish, miraculous, obviously rare, but highly coveted, proven by the film's smash hit (in a small budget film scale). The description of Tokyo, especially its subculture scene, is surprisingly unbiased and harshly real. Kudos to director Sofia Coppola who captured the very true moment of a Japanese punkster, singing a Sex Pistols line 'There is no future in England' in a karaoke bar.",7,1,1,4 October 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Two Separate Narratives Make Kubrick Look Indifferent, While His Commitment Makes the Film One of the Best
","Stanley Kubrick has a vocabulary of how to put the distance between the subject and himself, while flawlessly completing the exterior. The way in Full Metal Jacket, his installment of the Vietnamese War, is to present two separate narratives: one about a troublemaker in a training camp and the other about a Vietnamese shooter in a battlefield. The seemingly random combination of these two stories makes him look indifferent to the subject, while his commitment makes the film one of the best in the genre.Matthew Modine's persona perfectly fits into his role of Joker, who always tries to handle the various situations with a sincere manner. Directing actors may be the best part of Kubrick's genius, making all supporting actors look great. Music selection is well-thought: most notably, the end title, Paint It Black by the Rolling Stones, follows the soldiers singing Mickey Mouse in the last shot.",8,1,2,30 May 2004
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Hard to Believe the Film was Made in 1928
","While director Carl Theodor Dreyer is probably religiously motivated, the persistent usage of Joan of Arc's and the evil judges' Close Ups, which must be exceptionally innovative and progressive at the time, suitably conveys Joan of Arc's emotional intensity. Towards the end, several incredible external panning/tilting shots from extreme angles culminate the audience's emotion to the apex. It is hard to believe that the film was made in 1928.The version I watched is scored by Richard Einhorn, who blends the Middle Ages-esque melisma with a contemporary post-minimalism taste. The score is composed in 1985 and performed by Anonymous 4, and is impossible to exist as a soundtrack back in 1928, but for the contemporary audience it appropriately accompanies the film.",8,3,8,29 April 2004
The Battle of Algiers," Masterpiece with Historical Accuracy
","Capturing a historic incident/moment with extraordinary accuracy makes a film truly beautiful, painful, and masterful. With the tradition of Italian Neo Realism and French New Wave - i.e. shooting in location and casting nonprofessional actors, The Battle of Algiers harshly seals the ugly realities of both French Legion and Algerian Guerillas - i.e. indiscriminate bombs, tortures, and scapegoats. Ennio Morricone composed one of his early successful scores.",8,50,65,4 October 2003
Being John Malkovich," Slapstick of Identity/Sexuality Confusion Showcases Kaufman's Twisted Writing
","This cozy low-budget slapstick production, where the characters humorously struggle with confusions of identity and sexuality while being inside actor-in-the-real-world John Malkovich, showcases the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's twisted talent, while Spike Jonze is surprisingly invisible as a director. Some settings to generate an unusual atmosphere work (i.e., the seventh and half floor with a low ceiling), while the others don't (i.e., the Schwartzs' unusual pets such as a chimpanzee). Malkovich should have differentiated his acting more when Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is inside and controls him. The Malkovich-inside-Malkovich sequence, which is somehow reminiscent of an endlessly looped picture on a monitor when a camera is aimed at the monitor, is not unpredictable enough and seems to be added only to satisfy some demanding audience who would question this if it was not there.",7,0,1,11 August 2004
Spirited Away," More Sophisticated And Less Spirited Than Early Miyazaki
","(A Little Spoilers Included)As Hayao Miyazaki's fame grows internationally, his Japanimation productions become more sophisticated, more aware of the Western audience (In Spirited Away, the viewers can see the Western influence on some characters' facial features, most namely, Yubaba's), and, at the same time, less spirited than his earlier works. While Spirited Away may be one of the most well-designed productions of his, the story is relatively simple and focuses on a single argument, greed, which occasionally gets too ugly. Some settings are weak or absurd without reasonable explanations (e.g., why does Yubaba have to offer a job to anyone who's willing to work? What's the point that Haku, the lover of Sen/Chihiro, used to be a river in 'our' world?). Composer Jo Hisaishi appropriately enhances the neutral nature of the film with a John-Adams-ish indistinguishable post-minimalism score.",5,6,18,27 August 2004
The Usual Suspects," Multi-Layered Full-Course Entertainment with Classic Heist Cinema's Mood
","Within the classic heist cinema's earnest mood, The Usual Suspects multi-layers the full-course entertainment ingredients: a visually splendid waterfront explosion, a psychological tug-of-war between a suspect and an investigator, and a mystery regarding who the mastermind behind the crime is.The film's atmosphere is not only classic but somewhat foreign. It may be a coincidence, but My Beautiful Launderette, a Channel 4 masterpiece in the 80s' UK, might have influenced The Usual Suspects for two components: implied homosexuality and a trick shot that someone behind the glass window functions as a mirror to reflect the person on the other side of the window.",6,0,2,26 May 2004
28 Days Later...," Some Artistic Values But Overall Big Mess
","This Danny Boyle's action sci-fi flick, which illustrates a nightmarish near future, holds some artistic values but overall it is a big mess. While metaphors of AIDS and nuclear war are well-presented, towards the end, political power conflicts and fights in the army ruin the chance for the film to be successfully coherent.Some notable merits include casting, art direction, and editing. The combination of a white male anti-hero type and a decisive black female is freshly contemporary. The opening sequence shows one of the most memorable sci-fi art directions in recent years: caged monkeys exposed to video monitors that display footage of war and violence. Fast-paced editing on attacks of the infected, without clearly showing the attackers, effectively produces the fear of the attacked.",4,1,2,19 July 2004
La Grande Illusion," Forerunner of Escape Movies and Social Satire
","The Grand Illusion, a forerunner of escape movies as well as a social satire where the three French prisoners represent each own class, consists of roughly three parts which are slow and incoherent with each other. The desire for escape is not compelling while the prison room is huge and luxuriously furnished. The intense screen presence of Austrian director/actor Erich von Stroheim as an evil German soldier may be the best part of the film.",5,10,18,20 January 2004
The Piano," Hunter, Dryburgh and Nyman Perfect Campion's Masterpiece
","While the over-stylization may make some audience forget that the film is about the silence and the violence that women have had to suffer, Jane Campion orchestrates Holly Hunter's acting, Stuart Dryburgh's filming, and Michael Nyman's scoring (whose post-minimalism style is absolutely impossible to have existed in the 19th century, but who cares) so incredibly, so perfectly and so beautifully that everything else becomes irrelevant.The only defect I want to point out is the brief cartoon, which appears when Hunter's daughter invents the family history. It doesn't fit into the film at all.",10,0,3,18 March 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Homage Collage with Visual Extravaganza
","As a homage collage with visual extravaganza, Kill Bill drives both die-hard cinephiles' brains and average filmgoers' adrenalins. Naturally it is gaining both critical acclaims and commercial success.
There are some sore points in the screenplay. Many QT fans must be disappointed to find no witty dialogues, which have hugely contributed to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. This makes me wonder how much the dialogues in those earlier masterpieces relied on QT's ex-cowriter, Roger Avary. Also, his signature non-linear story structure seems meaningless this time. Obviously to build a climax, the less-engaged homage-to-blaxploitation chapter has to precede the highly-engaged homage-to-samurai-flick chapter in the film's timeline. It is pointless, however, to flip the revenge order in the protagonist Black Mamba's timeline; it is unnecessary for her to go to Japan first. If the reason is homage to non-linearly structured films including his own earlier works, I would call it autointoxication.Conceptually Kill Bill is a film adaptation of American Pop Art, whose main focus is how to display sampled materials in new contexts. While it has been QT's significant weapon throughout his filmmaking career, he limitlessly enhanced this technique and almost exclusively used it to paint this extremely colorful picture. The film's uniqueness along with the director's well-known perfectionism had guaranteed its success even before the preproduction phase. Then, as expected, he left no flaws at least in the visuals qualities, overseeing cinematography, art direction, and costumes. In other words, Kill Bill was comparatively less challenging to QT; he just precisely executed what he knew and what he could. As he may not want to repeat this one-and-only collage piece, the next several films will test his real value as a director.",8,0,1,23 October 2003
Big Fish," Burton Should Stick to Fantasy
","In this amalgam of fantasy and family drama, Tim Burton might have wanted the audience to experience two different genre films shuffled in one. The innovative storytelling, the dad modifying his experiences with his sense of wonder, is both a means and excuses to make such a unique world possible. However, with the artificially shallow father-son relationship, the family drama part, which is obviously not Burton's realm, falls apart. It makes the entire film remarkably unimpressive, while the fantasy sequences are truly fantastic. Burton should stick to fantasy, what he is good at.",5,0,1,12 February 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," This Is How People Express Love Nowadays
","(Spoilers Included)In a semi-sci-fi setting, former lovers Clementine (Kate Winslet) and Joel (Jim Carrey) respectively seek professional help to erase each other's memories, in order to move on easily. The audience learns their history through Joel's dream, while the memory-erasing process is ongoing and Joel in his dream, being afraid to lose Clementine, fights against it. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the most twisted rom-com ever made, is an appropriate representation of how people express love nowadays, and proves that our complicated modern world and the 100-year-old film media are still in synch.As the film progresses, the opening sequence, which the viewers would perceive as their first encounter, turns out to be their second meeting after their losses of each other's memories. In this film, this cliched amnesia gimmick does work, re-shifting the audience's brain and mind along with the fragmented development of Clementine and Joel's relationship.To enhance the twisted screenplay that only Charlie Kaufman can write, the director Michel Gondry uses low cinematic techniques (cinematography, editing, and post-production), most meaningfully and most effectively, probably for the first time since Godard.",8,0,2,30 May 2004
The Last Samurai," The Late 19th Century Is Not Suitable For Samurai Epic
","This samurai epic made by American filmmakers realizes an exotic fantasy towards Middle-Ages Japan for some people from the West and an idea of multiculturalism for everyone else, but a late-19th-century setting weakens the film's backbone. While the setting is a necessary excuse for the filmmakers because that was the time when an American could go to Japan and be a part of a guerrilla samurai group, it is apparently not suitable to portray samurai positively, when they are the obsolete people who cannot adapt themselves to the changes. With the emperor clearly pictured as a puppet of the new government, the motivation of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) to support him and resist the government is unclear and maybe historically inaccurate; throughout the Middle Ages, the nation of Japan had been ruled by a samurai government that also used the emperor as a figurehead.Technical note: Montages are overused; almost all scenes are established by them.",5,3,5,29 July 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," Just a Big Tease
","Kubrick's swan song is extremely crafted porn to tease the male audience, by letting nothing keep happening to male protagonist Tom Cruise and not revealing the details clearly at the masquerade orgy in a remote mansion. The setting is a big tease by itself, as the audience, who may identify themselves with pedestrian bourgeois Cruise, can only imagine if the story could be real or not. The empty film with the gorgeous outlook may be appropriate to conclude Kubrick's career, as he had perfected most of his works with various materials in a randomly wide range, which are sometimes meaningful and sometimes not.Technical note: The editor used a lot of long cross-dissolves, which are strongly annoying. I assume and hope it was not Kubrick's intention.",6,0,1,5 March 2004
Pretty Woman," Well-Formulated Rom-Com Encapsulates Materialistically Flashy 80s LA
","Encapsulating materialistically flashy LA in the 80s, Pretty Woman is a good showcase of well-formulated and well-executed rom-com which has always served as a mass-appealing vehicle to convey a social weather of one region in one era, usually in a superficial way, as Breakfast at Tiffany's does for the New York upper class bohemian scene in the 50s. While the combination of middle-aged lawyer Richard Gere and young hooker Julia Roberts is boring, it may be more worthy to pay attention to the details. For example, many might have started flossing in front of their lovers after having seen Roberts floss intimately before Gere. The production apparently takes huge advantage from adopting Roy Orbison's classic rock'n roll tune as a theme song.",4,3,6,9 April 2004
Pulp Fiction," Pop Art Cinema to Encapsulate the 90s
","Having extreme close-ups of objects such as a hamburger and a syringe (they are particularly reminiscent of James Rosenquist's paintings), quoting from numerous historic flicks, and referring to subculture icons in a humorous manner (most notably, Travolta wearing the T-shirt of UC Santa Cruz Banana Slugs), Pulp Fiction is a film version of American Pop Art, visually, technically, and conceptually. Retrospectively, it is a bit odd that it didn't take place earlier than the 90s; probably the narrative film is a relatively conservative art form and had to wait until the sampling concept became popular in the other field, i.e., music. Along with other ingredients, such as jocularly detailed dialogues and a non-linear plot, Quentin Tarantino has established one of the biggest trends in the mainstream American cinema in the 90s. The impression that the film now starts belonging to the past tells how much impact it has had on the particular era; it represents, summarizes, and encapsulates the 90s in the same way Easy Rider does for the 60s.",7,1,2,27 May 2004
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Priority to Style Ruins the Film
","Director Guy Ritchie's lust to have as many scenes as possible for vehicles to convey his flashy pictures results in a slow-paced and meaninglessly complex story with numerous side stories and side characters. Beautifully photographed along with minute art directions, but that doesn't make a good film by itself.",5,1,3,8 January 2004
Mystic River," Straightforward and Well-Crafted Filmmaking
","Amazingly straightforward and well-crafted Mystic River invokes nostalgia for Good Ol' Days' filmmaking. Acting and story tell everything without any flashy gimmick; this type of filmmaking is rare nowadays in the US, in both Hollywood and the independent scene. Some pictures, such as the lynch behind a bar at the climax, are reminiscent of the Spaghetti Westerns.This old-fashioned filmmaking produced over-masculine tone, portrayal of women as vulnerable attributes to men, and implied homophobia as byproducts, all of which don't quite fit into contemporary values.",6,0,0,8 January 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Well-Done Everyone's Hollywood Flick without Flaw
","With universal themes such as redemption, friendship, and good-defeats-evil tale, and without any significant technical flaws, it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption, one of well-done Hollywood flicks in the 90s by invisible employee directors, while it may also be difficult to find it compelling, imaginative, and inspirational. Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time, but this is made-in-Hollywood.",5,4,8,20 January 2004
