The Ring," Interesting,exciting....a little sunshine please.
","I don't normally get into horror but I liked this. The atmosphere is absolutely creepy. The rainy Northwest is as much a character as the actors. Naomi Watts and David Dorfman are very good as mother and son trying to figure out the mystery. The plot is a bit farfetched but it's horror, you got to go with it. The movie is most interesting as a mystery,the way they get to the reason why is smart and scary. I liked the movie but it would been helped out with a little humor and maybe, just maybe a little sunshine. I been to Seattle the sun does shine a bit. I know what your thinking 'sun and light' in horror movie? Really were not all 'Goths'. Good movie go and see it.",Null,0,0,12 December 2002
