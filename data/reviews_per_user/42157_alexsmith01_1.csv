Mission: Impossible III," Cheap, Cheap, ending *NO SPOILERS*
","I saw the film last night in Sydney at a Paramount preview screening, and although i'm not a real fan of the other MI films, i'm not one to say no to a free ticket! And to my surprise, i actually quite enjoyed the film... that was of course until the last ten minutes. Its quite a shame really, cause the film had a fantastic build up throughout with the all the excitement expected from a movie branded the 'most expensive film made by a debut big screen director'. However it is not surprising that this cheap ending came about with JJ Abrams at the helm, basically due to the fact that he is well known for not being able to finish what he has started (Alias, Lost etc). Oh well, as i said, its worth a look for the big bangs and 'good guy vs bad guy' violence, but i suggest you take a watch with you so that keep time and walk out about 12 mins before the movie finishes... trust me, you've seen it too many times before.",Null,1,4,2 May 2006
