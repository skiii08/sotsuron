Casablanca," The movie that sort of saved my life
","The purpose of writing this commentary is to solely state that the Writer in no way intends to compare Casablanca to any other movie in the history of motion picture; for the work is not only the pinnacle of Michael Curtiz career but also stands as a magical masterpiece in Twentieth Century Cinema.I hope I have the criterion to write a justifiable and unbiased review because this Movie is very special to me and I try not to become emotional when writing about this iconic monumental work. Considering the fact that there's nothing new to be said about Casablanca, I wonder where to start; probably from Rick's (Humphrey Bogart) philanthropy, Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) reciprocation—well reasoned and timely— her grace and heroism, the Battle of Anthems (German National Anthem vs French National Anthem), friendship, love, sacrifice, gallantry, patriotism, or plethora of amazing supporting actors such as Paul Henreid, Dooley Wilson, Claude Rains etc. Michael Curtiz surpasses in telling his story masterfully, directing every single actor in brilliant and indelible performance of a life time, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. The writers and the Director truly outshine themselves with the phenomenal multidisciplinary story of humankind. There's so much to grab onto with a remarkable film like this; say the soothing music for example--as time goes by--or the memorable dialogue: We'll always have Paris. We lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. When I said I would never leave you. Here's looking at you kid. Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris? It's not particularly my beloved Paris. Can you imagine us in London? When you get there, ask me! I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met... Was La Belle Aurore. How nice, you remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris. Not an easy day to forget. No. I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue. Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By.' Oh, I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you. Da dy da dy da dumb, da dy da dee da dumb... The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Casablanca to touch the soul. The only other movie I have ever seen that influences me as strongly is The Shawshank Redemption. Both movies leave me feeling influenced for having watched them; they have the power to inspire people and therefore I certainly say both pictures are neatly perfect organism. But just suffice to say that in addition to watching Casablanca habitually, I also tend to watch it on the following occasions: When I see or hear cruelty or crises anywhere in this—according to the movie, crazy—world. When I decide to travel to places not being recommended by my family or friends. On the eve of Eid and New Year's Day. Every-time when I am down or empty, or whatever they call it.Finally, this timeless classic deserved not only three Academy Awards but definitely the remaining five nominations that it lost unjustifiably.",10,3,4,29 January 2014
The Terminal," The Terminal is more than just a joyfully juvenile comedy romance
","It starts at JFK International Airport where upon his arrival, Viktor Novorski (Tom Hanks) learns that a coup has taken place in his home country Krakozhia (a fictional state name believed to be located in the Eastern Europe.) Viktor has very limited knowledge of the English language. He is barely able to answer airport's officials' repetitively bureaucratic questions.After he is stranded in the lounge, he struggles hard for his right to enter the US. But no body (airport staff/passengers) not only help him understand the news translation on TV, but also DO NOT facilitate the immigration process with his paper work.Amelia (Katherine Zeta Jones) plays her part as a flight hostess brilliantly. In parts you think she's made for the profession. Viktor and Amelia have a unique chemistry in this movie. The dialogue throughout the movie is very soothing no matter it's among Gupta and his co-workers accusing Viktor for being a spy or between Viktor and Enrique who wishes to win the heart of officer Dolores with the help of no other one but Viktor and or leading casts' history chat- specifically on Napoleon Bonaparte's genius and gallantry.The story is so well written. Viktor's adventure is to fulfill a promise and soon it turns into a survival story. In a scene, he goes from one store to another to make a living (three times meal.) At one shop, he's asked for contact details that much to everyone's surprise, he gives the nearby public telephone number and waits there for a phone call all day long and when finally the phone rings 'what are you going to do now?' asks the owner of the shop rejecting him. 'I'm go to the bathroom' Viktor replies.Clearly, this project is inferior to Spielberg's previous works such as Schindler List or Saving Private Ryan but needless to say, once again, he's paying attention to our deepest emotions as well. Imagine when it's peace again in Viktor's country, how hard he fights to fulfill his father's wish and then return to his home. It unfolds the curtains in front of the viewers' eyes and helps them to vividly see the twenty first century bureaucracy most governments adhere- the borderline mankind draws on their respective territories. It shows - the more - than - necessary formality of governments' departments which reminds us of Leo Tolstoy quote 'Government is an association of men who do violence to the rest of us.' It's about how Viktor copes with the unsettling conditions created by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who is the head of the airport and monitors the monitor room occasionally. Frank gradually becomes jealous or better said worried of Viktor because his inner self sees Viktor's popularity and patience larger than it actually is. It's as if he fosters a depravity inside himself the kind that John Claggart did in Herman Melville's famous novel Billy Budd. Claggart too was jealous of Billy's youth, strength and natural charisma. In concluding this commentary, the terminal is simple in the meantime a serious comedy that goes beyond the boundaries of the locations it's been filmed and repeats to thousands (well, HUNDREDS if thousands sound exaggeration) Viktors daily, weekly and monthly Viktors who are living in the third world countries and are being officially invited to wedding parties in countries rather their own- to a Western Country. Viktors who wish to fly to fulfill promises. Viktors who dream to embark on spiritual journeys, to make pilgrimage to the tombs of all those autonomous spirits- those literati and illuminati since middle ages instead faces severe tortures of bureaucracy since aviation facility or visa endorsement.Highly recommended to those with mildly humanitarian sensibility",8,0,1,29 July 2010
