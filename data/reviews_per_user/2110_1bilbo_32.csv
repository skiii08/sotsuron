Blade Runner 2049," Boring
","I was so disappointed in this film.For me, this has very little to do with the original Blade Runner and even less to do with the book.The story and editing are so disjointed with the film lurching from one CGI drama sequence to another.Ryan Gosling spends every clip gazing vacantly into the distance so much so that the first half of the film is spent waiting for Harrison Ford to show up.The point of the book is that humanity doesn't value animals until they are all gone - it seems that nobody involved with this franchise has actually read any Philip K Dick book. Tripe",1,8,14,30 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars is now dead.
",When the first ewok showed up in Star Wars three I knew that the whole fantasy was finished. However I didn't foresee that Lucas would trash the previous two with idiotic CGI and effects borrowed from Star Trek. That was bad enough but this film has so much rubbish in it that Star Wars can be said to be officially dead. Alec Guinness was right – he never wanted to do another episode after the New Hope and it is hard to believe that the original won 7 Oscars. Whatever moron thought up Jar Jar Binks he should remember that he has single handedly destroyed the finest Sci Fi film ever made. Back in 1977 I was in London and remember the larger-than-life photos in Leicester Square and the sense of wonder as we all caught our breath during the final chase scene. Nowadays the name Star Wars simply invokes a sense of disgust.,1,2,8,9 December 2012
Skyfall," Great until Finney turns up.
","This is by far the best Bond ever – despite the goofs.That is until Albert Finney appears; the idea that a Scottish gamekeeper would be so foul mouthed is implausible. Finney's entire character is not believable and should be fast forwarded. It is also ludicrous that they could have defeated the highly equipped bad guys with a few sticks of dynamite – Welcome to Scotland' should have been 'Welcome to nonsense.'All the rest of the cast are superb; especially Rory Kinnear and Ralph Fiennes who were both perfect in their roles. The entire MI6 set up is entirely believable and the film is terrific until they cross the border.This is the only Bond film where there is believable banter between 007 and M – there are some great comic moments, 'Run out of whisky where you were' and 'You're bloody well not sleeping here.' Are gems from M.I gave it 10 because it is so good – without Finney it would have been even better.",10,1,10,13 July 2014
The Ring," Poor remake of the Japanese original
","I watched the original Ring long before Hollywood had decided to 'have a go' at it. I found this remake to be entirely predictable.The original is a very chilling film  even when watched with subtitles. In this version we have the usual 'love angle' with the estranged child's father (yawn,) performed with textbook wooden acting. Then we have the irrelevant random shock images etc.The scene in the original Ring where she crawls out of the TV scene is one of the most chilling things I have seen, you know that this is evil in its pure form. On this weak remake it is nothing more than a girl with blood streaked horror make up on her face.The other really annoying thing about this film is how you keep recognising scene types that have been borrowed from other films. The dialogue between Rachel and Noah could have been lifted from any one of a dozen cheap family soap dramas.Weak predictable and unnecessary remake.",3,0,2,26 April 2007
Star Trek Into Darkness," CGI does not a story make
","This plot made little sense and unlike 'The Wrath of Khan' neither do the main characters.CGI does not a story make, if this film wasn't a part of a franchise which has devoted fans it would have passed by unnoticed.There is little attention to detail or what would really occur – especially with Kirk. When a crew member is confronted by a senior officer he does not answer back or interrupt his superior – Kirk is presented as a smart-mouth but in a real situation would have been in a glass house for 30 days for insubordination.Instead of a respectful crew this Enterprise bunch behaved like a crowd of school mates who are really good at running around shouting.It is a pity that the plug was pulled on the Enterprise series as this had real characters And genuine story lines.Sadly, it is because Star Trek has fans with the same devotion as football fans that there is little objectivity and the film company can be assured of a profit no matter what drivel it produces.",3,2,5,25 June 2014
The Irishman," Yawn
","Three and a half hours of dire dialogue and weak storyline.The story of Hoffa has been done better in previous films. Also, Al Pacino's 'I won't listen' interpretation of Hoffa simply became boring.Immediately following the film was a behind the scenes mini film which suggests that this was shot purely to generate more interest that the film itself did. Not a patch on Goodfellas, Casino and other notables which didn't have a mini additional film made alongside the main feature - why? because they didn't need it.Overlong and dull.",2,1,4,28 December 2019
The Mummy," Crap - watch the original
","Made with TV addicted 10yr olds in mind.This is an example of of how modern directors and crew have lost the art of film making.I don't know which came first - idiot viewers who demand little plot but lots of CGI or lousy films with huge budgets that have killed people's ability to concentrate for more that one minute.Whichever - this remake is expensive tripe with a stupid story and a predictable outcome. When we are introduced to a tomb that has an automatic door you just know that later on someone is going to be trapped forever - yawn.Watch the original with Karloff - see the suspense as the explorer goes insane with the shock, enjoy the excellent suspense.No comparison.",2,1,6,19 January 2012
Aquaman," Rubbish - I will never watch another DC movie.
",The story is convoluted and makes no sense.It is just endless fights and explosions.Just when you think the movie is ending it kicks back into gear with more running and fighting in front of a 'Green screen' backdrop.Dreadful.,1,2,2,21 December 2019
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Poor remake - watch the original.
","If you have never watched the original then you won't know just how good this story is. Gary Goldman's acting is rather similar to a manikin; his expressionless stares are an example of how poor so many actors are nowadays. He is no Alec Guinness! The original series really did capture the atmosphere of the civil service this poor remake showed that the director had little idea of what British government offices are really like. Also, he totally failed in all the characterisations. Many top civil servants are ex-public school and this was so very well portrayed in the original series and totally missed in this film. Each character in the story was wrongly portrayed in the film – especially Connie. Smiley's introvert and flawed personality was completely missed and the phoney happy ending with his wife was so pathetic. The violence in this film was gratuitous and wholly unnecessary – as was the foul language, including the murder of a woman who was feeding her baby was a reflection of a sick minded and second rate director. Rather than me list the numerous flaws in this film just do the sensible thing. Watch the original.",2,9,17,5 October 2011
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Dreadful
",A New Hope had a great story line and didn't have CGI.This high budget monster is people running around in front of a 'Blue Screen' and no story.I sat through the film just waiting for it to end - and just when it looked like it was going to conclude it would start up again.I can't think of a single compelling scene - just more and more cheese.,1,57,97,8 January 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkein reduced to Harry Potter.
","I was so looking forward to this film and was so disappointed.Apart from a few moments the real magic of the book was reduced to a Harry Potter children's story. Gandalf looked ridiculous in the stupid hat and Bilbo looked like an ageing David Essex!Where was Tom Bombadil? There was enough time (3hrs,) for a reference to him but no it had to be taken up with fireworks and a romance (not in the book). And how badly was Boromir played  Sean Bean was dreadful.At every twist and turn the story was changed from the book and the mystique and wondrous magic of the book was lost in special effects and convoluted dialogue.Tedious",5,2,4,3 April 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Disapointing - like Aliens 3
","So disappointing - just like Alien 3, plot inconsistent with the first two. Ridiculous co-incidences (the vet going to school with Conner,) and a serious absence of Mz Hamilton - she was as much a part of T2 as Arnie.Also why not use the real actor from the T2 as John Conner - he is the right age now.Cameron knew his films and several of the scenes from T2 can be traced back to John Wayne`s True Grit and others. The current director has relied more on explosions and special effects than a consistent plot.They have blown it for T4 - just like Aliens 4 was a flop except for the die-hards.",4,0,0,21 August 2003
"I, Robot"," Nothing like the book - a wasted opportunity
","I do not know how Hollywood directors manage to get things so wrong.I Robot was (and is,) a superb collection of short stories centering around the logic of the robotic laws, it is superb. The central character is an elderly female analyst who specialises in robotics and she is called upon to unravel the complexities of behaviour patterns amongst robots.This film turned an intelligent story by Azimov into a special effects drama, which owes most of its premise to Terminator.If you like tedious drawn out special effect fight scenes then this is for you, if you have read Azimov's book then you will see little resemblance to it in this film.",3,3,6,4 December 2004
Van Helsing," Terrific Sound score, great entefrtainment.
","This is a film that takes a lot of liberties but is great entertainment. I went back to the cinema three times just I could hear the audio score at full volume. The music is fantastic and the film basically does not stop for breath. Dracula is superb and Helsing is played with more than a little tongue in cheek.The church sends Helsing on a mission to wipe out Dracula and gives him a helper who is obviously modeled on Q from James Bond. A film buff will recognize many of the borrowed scenes  a stagecoach chase scene that is reminiscent of John Wayne and cliff edge scenes that reminded me of the many cliff falls that appeared in the roadrunner cartoons.The acting was great and the film tears along at breakneck pace with an ending that has a real twist, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",9,0,1,30 October 2004
Quantum of Solace," Ho hum
","I went today with high expectations but was really bored. The story line is really convoluted and difficult to follow - not because it is involved but simply because it is badly put together. Against this there is one implausible action sequence after another with Bond out running and killing everybody despite the odds - are all the baddies really such poor shots?Then we have the central person Bond - the most wooden actor ever. We are treated to this expressionless lethal Ninja who can defeat highly trained and armed guards with just a couple of blurred-action swipes of his arms. Yes, the action sequences deserve a mention - blurred movement sequences lasting a few seconds each all edited together with a healthy dose of CGI. It felt like I was watching a Playstation game.With so many really great spy stories to pick from why can't this film franchise buy up a really good plot instead of employing 500 stunt men.",3,5,7,14 November 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Expensive tripe
",The visuals made no sense.The Story did not exist - just a load of stupid CGI.This film was a collection of disjointed mini stories that seem to have straight out of a childs' essay homework.Luke Skywalker got shot to death and it then turns out he is not really there - it reminded me of Dallas 'Who shot JR' which turned out to be a dream.I won't be attending any more Star wars films.,1,3,4,26 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Plenty of CGI but no story or soul
",I went into the movie theatre expecting something great but ddin't get antthing worth the time.This movie is simply a series of disjointed sequences - laser fights and lots of running around.There are plenty of build ups to climaxes that don't materialise but virtually no story - I found it difficult to follow who was fighting who.Star wars is dead.,1,2,3,19 December 2017
The Descent," Gratuitous gore.
",I watched this film last night  expecting something really great and was very disappointed.For me the film sets up rhetorical situations i.e. when they are crawling through the tiny tunnel I just knew that the cave would collapse. Tunnel and cave have been OK for 100 years but decide to collapse when the girls pay a visit  so obvious.Why didn't the girls have walkie talkies? They seemed to have helmets and lamps that were very expensive and survived water and everything else  common sense would be to have radio communication in case of emergencies.I found the dimly lit action sequences tedious and gratuitous.Some of the eye make seemed to survive exceptionally well! For me The Descent was little more than a Halloween type slasher movie hopefully in a couple of years time it will be completely forgotten.,3,8,14,31 December 2005
War of the Worlds," This film contains everything that is wrong in Hollywood.
","This film contains everything that is wrong with Hollywood.Take a superb book by H.G.Wells, remove 90% of the plot and content and replace it with a trite drama between Cruise and his ex-wife, next add some low grade special effects and there you have this film. The book starts with a quiet silent visitation watched in terror by a lone person as he sees the ray gun destroy everything in its path. Hollywood starts with an almighty special effects sequence with the usual running and screaming and all the other CGI junk that is used to replace a good story line.The book ended with reports of how the ministry of defence tried to harness the power of the alien ray guns, Hollywood ends with a hackneyed tearful reunion of Cruise's family.In-between we have some glaring errors, Cruise has the only working car in town that is blown to bits but there is a convenient path left between all the debris for him to drive through. Everybody's electrical items are disabled by the aliens (including watches,) but curiously video cameras and recorders are still working. This idea was done much better in an episode of The Invaders. Cruise's son is obviously blown apart in the conflict but miraculously shows up later on.It is also amazing that with the huge budget they had the aliens still looking like they were borrowed from a computer game. Anybody who has watched Kill Bill will know how good special effects can be if they are done without the aid of a PC.Disappointing – a missed opportunity.",1,0,2,10 January 2010
Prometheus," Spoiler - very poor.
","This movie just failed to deliver.The suspense wasn't there, the really great opening scene from Alien where we look around the ship created a real atmosphere – nothing like that in this film. Also we now had to have a 'Love interest' sub plot – listen you directors love interests are for girlies who watch Friends – sci-fi is above that.Then we had the convoluted graphics that were created in the abandoned space ship – they were colourful but meant nothing much. How much better when the original computer 'Mother' was accessed by Sigourney Weaver in the original.By the time the nasty creatures has revealed themselves the film had descended into gratuitous horror.A wasted opportunity.",5,6,10,8 August 2012
The Woman in Black," Not as good as the 1989 version.
","This film concentrated on the shock and terror of a haunted house. The use of sound effects was very good and the visuals terrifying. Many people complained that the casting of Harry Potter was a mistake but as I have never watched a Harry Potter film I wasn't distracted and he performed very well. However, as I watched the film I recognised scene after scene that had been lifted from classic horror films, the empty rocking chair that keep rocking by itself, the clockwork toys that go off by themselves, the door handles that turn by themselves etc. Obviously the director has watched many older Hammer films and this film is almost homage to them rather than an original work. The ending was exactly the same as 'Dr Terrors' with the exception that it was really weak and the final scene was obviously created to enable a 12a certificate and happy ending rather than the 18 it should have had. It is not as good a film as the 1989 version especially the ending. However, if you simply want to be terrified then it works on that level quite well.",7,0,0,11 March 2012
Iron Man," Yawn
","If you like lots of running around, lots of CGI and lots of explosions then this is for you. This movie is just following a well worn formulae and is nothing more than every other super hero movie rolled into one.A man is captured and kept in a cave for three months during which time he is ordered to construct a 'Super destructive' weapon out of bits of other captured weapons. Instead he constructs a super metal skin with built in flame throwers that is so strong that it resists 1000s of bullets rained down on it. Then he is walking around a desert when - of all the luck - a series of helicopters just happen to find him. Next he gets back to his own lab and manages to construct a metal suit that can fly and do battle. Yawn.The predictable - bad guy in the camp - ending is really obvious and tedious.",1,13,28,25 December 2008
Sweet and Lowdown," Tedious and unfunny.
",It was so obvious that Sean Penn was not playing the guitar during the performances. I am surprised that Woody Allen who is a good musician would insult guitarists like this. Penn was not only not playing but nowhere near the area of the fingerboard that the notes were coming from.The only interest was Django`s music apart from that the film dragged on with a very poor ending. somebody tell Woody that jazz guitar players do not smash up their guitars - it just doesn`t happen.I will buy the CD of the music but never watch the film again.,3,5,11,3 April 2004
The Producers," Incomparable wit.
",This is Mel Brooks at his finest hour with the perfect actors in Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. Zero plays a down-at-heels producer who cons elderly ladies into investing money into his plays. Wilder is his accountant who is persuaded to join him in producing a sure fire flop  which would mean that none of the investments would have to be paid back.I have read that Brooks and Mostel didn't get on which is why Mostel's performance is so good. Especially the early scene where he tears up his 'cardboard belt'.I also love the dialogue such as Wilder: 'Let us assume that you are a dishonest man.' Mostel: 'Assume away.' I can't imagine anybody else in the two lead roles  The Producers is a shining diamond in the history of film-making. 10/10.,10,2,4,28 December 2004
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The force flops
","I went to see this on day one - expecting great things, yawn.The plot doesn't make a lot of sense and the entire film relies on CGI and washed out characters who look just like extras from 'central casting' who have donned their masks and headsets.Why would a Dark Lord smash up equipment on hearing bad news ? More the behaviour of a 12yr old who didn't get their own way. Or - and this is where the plot really begins - the director couldn't think of a decent reaction to an event.Also, what was Skywalker doing sulking on top of a mountain without any obvious means of getting food or shelter ?Next episode - the force goes back to sleep.",5,15,17,30 October 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Worst of the three
","As with the other two films in the series I wonder if the director actually read the book or just had a secretary read bits of it to him.The scenes are drawn out to ridiculously tedious lengths and bits of the plot are missed out whilst other bits are invented. And of course to appeal to the 'ER' watching mentality a romance was invented for the film. Then to add further insult they all burst into song at the end.I don't know if these films were made chronologically but the actors do seem a bit fed up of the characters by the end. Also, our Shelob was so obviously a computer animation it made the pseudo scary build up a complete anticlimax.Tedious.",5,4,8,3 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Original is best - spoiler
","This post is about the original vs. the tweaked remake.There is only one decent version of this film and that is the original one!Several scenes are ruined by the inclusion of silly CGI creatures running around on the remakes, also the remakes include explosions that are obviously lifted from Star Trek.There are those of us who would rather see stop motion animation than CGI because it is actually more realistic – every fiery explosion (in the background as the hero runs away,) looks identical, also there is something unreal about CGI footage that is much better done With matt overlays.Same with King Kong – give me the original any day.",10,1,1,26 September 2011
Jackie Brown," Excellent plot - perfect cast
","This film is superbly crafted with excellent twists in the plot and in depth character studies of several people.There is no such thing as 'blacksploitation' it was the name given to films like the original Shaft which depicted a black male as being sexually desirable. The red necks couldn't stand that and had to rubbish Shaft and black males were recast back into comic roles (E.g. Will Smith.) Proof? I don't know of a single other film, which depicts a black male as an object of sexual desire.Jackie Brown is beautiful and smart but has been `round the block` a few times and is sick of starting her life over again every few years. She outsmarts the crooks and the cops and falls for the bail bond guy who assisted her. The film's ending is quite sad as he lets her go and then realises - with a shock - that he will never again get the chance of such a fantastic woman.Watch and enjoy!",10,1,4,23 May 2003
Sin City," Gratuitously violent
","I found this film to be gratuitously violent and I wonder about the physiological workings of the minds that constructed it. The film is very well made and the actors play their parts extremely well and the imagery is exceptionally powerful. However, I watched it waiting for a conclusion and found none, at the end of the movie I realised that this was simply a journey designed to gratify the minds of people who feed on the unspeakable.Presented in black and white, which has been processed to resemble chrome/black/white with few shades of grey. Blood and guts are presented in either red or yellow and the face of a sick deviant is entirely presented in a yellow wash. There are more subtle additions as the eyes of certain actors turn from b/w to their true colour and then back again. Obviously designed to capture the horror of the magazines it has been taken from, there were scenes of torture that could possibly have disgusted Edgar Allen Poe.I don't know how far downwards Hollywood is going to have to go to create the next level of horror, as there is not much more that we can be desensitised to.",1,17,38,20 February 2006
Spectre," Tedious and overblown.
","Skyfall was superb so this had a lot to live up to and it doesn't.There are so many loopholes; Q was afraid of heights so how can he go in ski lift, London is very busy day and night so how can a helicopter crash into a bridge next to the houses of parliament when it is deserted, how does a car drive up a snow covered steep mountain side without skidding, why do the walls of railway carriages brake up like pieces of flimsy cardboard during a fight ? Etc.Then there is the quite gratuitous violence ( i.e. gouging a man's eyes out.) Plus the ridiculous shoot outs where Bond fells 50 other gunmen who all seem to be very poor shots.Which brings me to the plot - what plot ? This was so convoluted that it seems to have been made up as they went along. I had enough after the first hour but wanted to see how it ended - poorly.This film compares very poorly to either Hit-man or Bourne; Sam Mendies seems now to be the director to avoid.I am sure this film will make a fortune but as the saying goes 'If million people like a stupid thing - it is still a stupid thing.'",1,164,316,22 November 2015
The Martian," Dull
","This does not live up to the hype.I rented the video and after the first hour was really bored and fast forwarded it until near the end. At 4x speed I could follow the plot without any trouble.I love Science Fiction but there seems to be very little that is any good nowadays, Ex Machina was the finest thing I have seen for years.Back to the plot - man gets stranded on Mars, survives and is then rescued against all odds, yawn. The costumes were good - just like Ed Wood's terrible plays; the costumes got good reviews.I want to be entertained not bored to death with instructions on how to grow potatoes on Mars!",3,0,3,9 February 2016
The Island," Tedious
","This is a well-worn theme and an entirely predicable film.Humans are being cloned for organ transplants is a top-secret installation. Two of the clones realise what is going on and escape to the outer world only to be pursued by a massive heavily armed unit who are intent on killing/capturing them both.Amazingly, the clones manage to outwit this very sophisticated paramilitary unit with their bare hands, destroy their convoy of cars, dodge the bullets, avoid the helicopters and survive a drop from a 70-floor building. All the baddies are of course terrible shots and there just happens to be a net to catch them as they fall from the building. Of course we are now treated to the obligatory 'love scene' between the two heroes of the story. Yawn.Then  guess what  they go back and rescue all the other clones and destroy the installation.Wouldn't it be great if Hollywood made films which had a credible story instead of endless CGI explosions and non-existent car chases.",2,2,6,31 January 2007
