Vertigo," Phenomenal
","This film, i would say this is Hitchcock at his best. This film, is said to be a classic of Hitchcock's films, and it undoubtedly is. The camera angles, the music, the acting, the plot, the director. ALL are superb. This film, is very unguessable about what will happen next, and had many twists.. Vertigo i feel was GOOD title as it pointed out the thing that held the plot together. The music corresponds with it's dramatic scenes. Vertigo showed Hitchcock had a lot more to come which he did. I love the way the colour schemes are used, with flashbacks etc.. the film has a dramatic and brilliant end which is brilliant.. Hitchcock's Masterpiece is a Must See for all. Movie Lovers will not want to miss out on Alfred Hitchcock's vertigo.",10,3,6,3 August 2008
