Walk the Line," Good but Lacks a spark
","This is a good family movie. Good performances, good storytelling, good music ( of course if you like Johny Cash). It looks like many other autobiographic movies, but tells the story of Johny Cash instead of Elvis Presley, John Nash or anyone else. It lacks something that unifies itself from other movies like it. Walk The line follows a common formula of a Rise - Fall - Rise again,but except of the tragic opening, the movie isn't a tear dropping experience, and not too dramatic. Except this, the movie is abundant with good music, some funny moments and never boring.I didn't read the biographies of Johny Nash, so I don't know in which detail he portrayed his life, and what part of it the director did not show us. What the director focused about is the developing love between Johny Cash and June Carter Cash throughout a decade, until they got married. This part done exceptionally well. One can feel the true love between them. So if we don't look at it as a biography, it is a great love story.There are other aspects of Johny Cash's life that were briefly shown but weren't developed. One of those is the relationship he had with his fellow musicians in the Sun Records. We see brief performances of Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, names that everyone know and that the main Character been close to (they toured together) for a while, but we don't see the interaction between them (or lack of interaction). We also see a brief scene with Johny Cash and Walon Jennings, when they shared an apartment together, also without too many words about them.My point in the last paragraph is, that we study people not only by their stories but also by their relationship with others, and how others see them. We also could learn something about Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis from the way Johnny Cash saw them. That part of his biography lacked for me in this movie.The biggest surprise for me was that the main characters did all the performances by themselves. I think that Reese Witherspoon may start a singing career.",7,6,10,25 August 2006
Deja Vu," Very Interesting
","I'm not much of a fan of Tony Scott's movies. Especially if we are talking about his recent efforts like Man Of Fire, Domino and Spy Games. Though many would disagree with them I don't think these were good. Deja vu on the other hand is very similar to Enemy Of The State. There is no much of innovative and experimental shootings, only great shooting angles.The difference in this movie, is that it has a very interesting plot with a twist towards the end of the movie. Adding to this a couple of explosions and a good cast sums to two hours of fun. Moreover, it leaves the taste to see it again to catch all the little details.It also recommended to watch it with someone, to discuss the details after wards.Really enjoyed it.",8,1,3,13 April 2008
Training Day," Flawed but Entertaining.
","I just watched the movie for the second time. I wasn't impressed like the first time, but still liked it. This movie hasn't got any depth beyond the plot, this is not Fight Club or Sixth Sense, where watching the film second time around, reveals some details you didn't see before. Here the second watch didn't add anything new to me (except of finding new holes in the plot), but I still liked it and haven't got any disgusting feelings about it as others did. I wasn't bored either.First of all I liked the plot.I liked the idea of the whole movie taking place in one day. And most of all I liked the acting of the leading roles. Specially of Denzel Washington (and I really don't care about the award). I really don't understand most of the complaints people have about this movie. It's not perfect and there are some plot holes ( which most of the complaints don't even touch), but even though it's entertaining. And definitely not the worst movie like some say. Of course there were movies about 'bad cop - good cop' , but not in this scheme. I think it had even some originality in it. And if you don't like Violence in movies - don't see it. But don't say you hate this movie because of the violence. Training Day's genre is violence. Finally to the character of Alonzo. I honestly think that Russel Crow should have the Oscar. He had a much deeper character to portray (in Beautiful mind), and did an excellent job with it. Nevertheless, the character of Alonzo was about one of the worst kind of people that there are on earth ( and if you see some documentary investigation, you understand that such people exist). Don't complain that you didn't like the character, I hated him either, that's why I think Denzel Washington made a great effort. Some credit to Ethan Hawke also.Some holes in the plot: 1) I think the most visible one, and the most annoying is the one-to-million coincidence of Lisa being the cousin of Smiley. What chances that Lisa's wallet would save Hoyt? 2) Hoyt isn't used to narcotics and we see it on the effect the drugs have on him. But so strong of an effect should have take longer in time to recover from it. 3) After Smiley releases Jake he immediately goes to Alonzo's house. How did he remember where Alonzo lives? He couldn't remember it from one ride being on narcotics. 4) At the end of the movie Hoyt got serious beating from Alonzo. He was face smashed through the window, got hit with a chair, kicked and punched and after all that he managed to stand back and ready to fight again in a couple of minutes.As I said. This movie is flawed, but still entertaining.",7,0,1,11 March 2006
Gravity," Artificial tension.
","The fuel the movie has, apart from the visuals, is Sandra Bullocks' emotions, and it's just wasn't enough. Maybe it's because there is no plot, though in my opinion, Sandra Bullocks' character wasn't very interesting and intriguing, and I didn't care much about her. I really hated her constant whining. The supposed to be tension, was very artificial. The director just threw more and more obstacles, instead of building a tension around a character. I wasn't involved with the characters' emotions. I thought they were artificial either.While, I don't think that the actors, Clooney and Bullock, made a good job, I think that the director is the one who totally blew it up. Sorry, but even if he succeeded in making cash for the production company (by adequate trailers and a very aggressive promotion), in the long run, it will be regarded as a stain on his career.Like Avatar, Gravity was attended mainly because of its' visuals. But Avatar had enough plot and character development to sustain the visuals, while Gravity had none.",4,1,4,10 November 2013
Passengers," Afraid to be simple
","I didn't see the trailer of the movie up until writing this review. So I decided to look the movie based on reading the story line. So I didn't know it will turn into a semi-disaster movie.The premise is very good. It's quite original and sets a stage for inquiries into ethics, relations, meaning of life, happiness and loneliness. Enveloped in science fiction combines good special effects and some really cool ideas (like the pool with a view to the stars).I liked the choice of the leads. Especially the female lead, since she had to be sexy. Generally, a very good job of portraying the emotions.Unfortunately, things started to take the wrong turn with the appearance of Laurence Fishburne's character. When philosophical questions were replaced by technical malfunctions that made little sense and that I just didn't care about. And questions of ethics and the perception of happiness were substituted by the usual hero type of actions that introduce stupidity and deteriorate the whole experience.Eventually 'Passengers' stayed very shallow on its initial premise and didn't explore any of the vast number of interesting possibilities it could have been. Seems to be the usual case of Hollywood compromising good story for special effects to draw the audience. Considering the lead actors involved, its' quite a shame they needed that. When it comes to numbers, the studios may be right. But I fail to see it wins lots of hearts.",5,1,2,12 March 2017
Argo," Good movie, though with some criticism.
","Good movie in general. Ben Affleck did a good job. Quite tight plot with good cinematography and great performances. When at the end, they showed the actors, beside the photos of real people they have portrayed, I was quite amazed by the similarity. Goodman and Arkin provided the light and humorous side of the movie.My criticism here is pointed towards the 'artificial suspense' that the movie creates in several occasions. My point here is that if you have a bomb countdown, the usual Hollywood trick to create suspense is to stop the bomb at the deadline. Argo had several such moments. sometimes it felt fit and sometimes artificial, dragging time just to make suspense. Which on the other hand 'stole' time from the rescue operation and put some of its elements to the background.",7,1,2,20 March 2013
Alexander," One of the best movies in times.
","This is certainly the most underestimated movie in all times.First I saw the rating and thought that it's another history/mythology movie that is wasted ( like Troy ). But I read the reviews about it and decided I should see it, and thanks for that. Now I'm joining to those who are praising the movie.My friends that saw the movie complained about over homosexual reference. In my opinion the movie sets everything in proportion. There is nothing explicit, no porno. It's just the director trying to make us see the real story about Alexander. What person he was, whom he loved, what did he tried to achieve? And I think he succeeded. When the movie was over I could tell that this is how it was for real.The battle scenes, though short, are great. Specially the view of the battle field from an eye of an eagle. All the views were magnificent: the desert,the tropical Indian forest, snow mountains... The only movie that can be compared over the views with Alexander is Hero. The acting was superb. I can hardly see anyone else instead of Colin Farrel as Alexander. I can continue like this about everything the dialogs, costumes, score... I was paralyzed when I saw it.This is definitely the best movie for Oliver Stone, and one of the best in all times. And for those who despised it just because of the homosexual reference, think that this is probably close to true story of Alexander. I'm sure none would like the battle with the Ellefant to be omitted.",9,0,6,19 August 2005
About Time," Essentially Good.
","About Time is a really good movie, that manages to deliver a message and touch feelings. Someone noted here that this is the reason we go to see movies, and taking About Time as a whole, I totally agree. I was moved, and this feeling is still with me as I write. And I know I'll watch it again.Now for the technical side. About Time is a light comic drama with a good heart. From the very start one can see the good production values. Very good narrative, performances and cinematography. However, it also introduces some awkwardness, primarily due to the awkward, off bit characters, including Tim. In fact most of the male characters through the movie are such, and this is a bit of a down side. At start it reminds very much of Groundhog Day. But somewhere along the way it takes its own direction and Groundhog Day is forgotten. It is not always engaging, but for its' above 2 hours length, it has a very good pace, narrative and performances and never boring. For its last part, it starts to be engaging and very moving.About Time has some drawbacks. First are the already mentioned, off bit characters. I think they were made such to add a comic side, but it mostly felt a bit out of place. However, this wasn't too severe (not in terms of screen time nor in its intensity). The second was some of the occurrences Tim decided to change. He seemed to be quite smart, so understanding the major risks and outcomes of changing the past shouldn't be too hard. Instead, he makes a mistake of changing events too far in time, more than once, which makes him a bit less likable.However, nothing is flawless. And like a person, this movie has its own drawbacks. And while they're visible, they are outweighed by far by its benefits. About Time succeeds in getting the best emotions from ourselves. Making us think of how we can improve our lives, being us, but looking at things from a slightly different point of view. And just for this, I would recommend it as a must watch.",8,0,0,10 May 2014
The Prestige," One in a Million.
","There are occasions, when you know, you have seen something amazing. Something you don't see quite often. In movies, Prestige is definitely that something. I left the cinema with the feeling that I have seen an amazing movie, comparison to which I can hardly find. There were some good movies that came out recently, but Prestige is truly one in a million.Prestige belongs to the mystic genre of movies. It's mystic not only because there's a mysticism, but also because of the indirect narrator's style. It belongs with movies such as : Sixth Sense, The Butterfly Effect, Donny Darko, The I inside, Angel Heart, The jacket etc ... . Can't say it's the best in the category, but I definitely enjoyed it more than anything I listed.The ending twist point was already done before ( Snapdragon, Les RiviÃ¨res pourpres ). But as Michael Caine's character stated : You have got to know how to sell the trick. The outstanding way this twist point was sold to us, the viewers, makes the whole movie original.The interesting plot and the perfect performance make this movie enjoyable, and unforgettable. I'm definitely going to buy this movie on DVD to watch again with my friends and family.Just watch it!!!!!!!!!",10,1,1,5 May 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Lacks the charm of the first movie.
","First of all, I have to say that, If I were 10 years younger, I'd probably rate this movie 6 or 7. Mainly for the great visual effects and a quite awesome action.If 'Hellboy : The Golden Army' was a standalone movie, or if I didn't see the first one, I'd say that something lacks in this movie. Something that make this movie very childish. But after seeing the first one, I know what this movie lacks. It lacks the Hellboy character.What makes 'Hellboy' different from other super-hero movies is the character of Hellboy. Cool, quite egoistic, funny ... . His character and charm applied to the scenes he's in. However, in the second movie, it's quite the opposite. The scenes are built to fit Hellboy's character. For instance, it seems that the whole contribution of the 'Johann Krauss' character was that Hellboy could mock on his German accent.Some of the scenes were quite ridiculous: 1) When the paranormal bunch went to Prince Nuada's den they accidentally bumped into a creature that healed Hellboy, the emphasis is of course on accidental. 2) In the first scene of the 'good guys' against the 'little eating creatures', the humans FBI agents just stand still and shoot ( and await to be eaten ). They don't try to run or to avoid those creatures. Worse, is that no one of the superheroes there tries to do anything to avoid their death. 3) There supposed to be 70 golden warriors, though in the end, their number is close to 70,000.There are few more but, I'll settle with the above.I don't think that kids will notice the flaws I mentioned. So, probably they'll love it. Even more than the first one.",4,6,11,26 April 2009
Molly's Game," Great actors make a great movie.
","The movie is pure quality from start to finish. Good story, Great storytelling and perfect actors. A well thought, well executed film including casting, dialogues, costumes and camera work.Jessica Chastain is absolutely fantastic as Molly Bloom. She is the captivating, strong, attractive and smart persona capble to navigate in the world owned to rich men. She gracefully carries the movie on her shoulders. All other characters nail their role well. From Idris Elba, Molly's attorney to Graham Greene as the judge. Very good gestures and body langues from all involved.The only missing ingredient here is something to stand out. Basically, this 'Rise and Fall' formula - the lead starts to do well until he's doing too well to stay unnoticed and things start to go wrong - was done before several times before ('Wolf of Wall Street', 'Casino') so there isn't much novelty here.To sum it up, Molly's Game is a very good watch. One may have seen it all before, but it is a very well crafted movie with very sympathetic characters.",8,3,5,21 August 2018
Fast & Furious 6," Worth the ticket
","Fast and Furious 6 is quite on par with the rest of the movies in the series. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. The first hour and a half were quite good, and I didn't understand what the other reviewers were complaining about. It felt just like the other movies, and some parts were even better. But the last two action sequences were exaggerated.The good about Fast and Furious 6: All the members of the team were busy and had their parts. This is the first time that they were actually matched with a tough rivals. Luke Evans played his character well, and he had a crew that was physically tough, sophisticated and well equipped. The return of Letty is good thing as well. Michelle Rodriguez was perfect.The bad: The exaggerated last action sequences. It's not that Fast 5 had a credible last scene. It didn't have, but I didn't think about it when I was watching it. It was just fun. Here I found myself thinking 'this is too much'. Another think is Hobbs. I liked him in the fifth movie. Here I find him slightly annoying. And some fights in the end felt redundant. I think that if the director have settled on more casual action, instead of choosing the bigger but much less credible action, it would be better.",6,1,3,15 June 2013
American Hustle," Average
","Very, very average movie. And considering the cast, it's actually bad. I don't know why there is a comedy tag on the movie. There were about 2 comic occasions in a 138 minutes long movie. There is also a clear stance on showing the FBI as the 'bad guys' while trying to make Carmine Polito as Maria Teresa. Another irritating thing was the notion that the whole FBI operation was conducted by a single guy. And not a very bright one.I liked the plot. Though it took about an hour to ignite the engines, it progressed interestingly afterwords. Even the unnecessary relationship matters, that delayed the progress as the movie went on, didn't damage the plot extensively.Other bright spots are the performances of Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job, but her character got much more screen time that it should. Bradley Cooper, on the other hand, ruined what others built. Every scene he was in, brought some antagonism from my side. Instead of having a serious, smart and restrained type of agent we got a stupid and a cocky one. This wasn't the right type of character, and Bradley Cooper wasn't the right actor.In all, FBI looked like a bunch of clowns. Bypassing the chain of command, beating your supervisor.There is another drawback in focusing on the unnecessary meandering relationship between the main characters. However, on the most part, the actors played their roles well and it wasn't the accent.In conclusion I would say that the director, David O. Russel, has some gift of storytelling but fails to make it entertaining. And the latter happens mainly because of the implicit stupidity in the movie. For myself, I have a very low tolerance for implicit stupidity. As I see it, the director assumes the audience is not smart enough, and that is a major fault. For some movies it is alright to be stupid. American Hustle on the other hand, is plot and character driven drama, so it does not have any excuse of being such.",5,2,3,6 July 2014
Baby Driver," Minority review
","'Baby Driver' is one of the most praised movies on IMDb that I have ever seen, and after comparing different feature films that are currently screened the choice was quite clear. While overall I did like 'Baby Driver', I definitely do not share the enthusiasm of the vast majority of the reviewers here. I'll briefly go over my point of view on the movie and then share my likes and dislikes.'Baby Driver' is a heist movie; however, the accent here is on the getaway. The plannings and the robberies are in the background. Besides that there are the usual themes: the last job, misfits who find each other and psycho robbers/killers who pull off the heist.For me, the best parts of the movie were the car chases. Not perfect, but still great and quite original. They felt quite authentic as well. Reminiscent of the chases in the Bourne series but slightly better.The other things I liked were: the acting and the camera work. I think that every actors did well, but I'd mention Jamie Foxx as being the most convincing in his role.For the faults (from my perspective) I would pick the third heist as the major one. It is where all started to disintegrate and became quite stupid. It's first evident in the choice of the crew members, the relationship between Baby and Doc, The chain of events and the overlong, quite boring standoff between the main protagonist and the main antagonist.I'll sum it up by saying that It just didn't meet my expectation. Yes, after reading the description and reviews I thought that perhaps it would be something like 'The Town' or even 'Heat' with those ratings. However, unlike the noted movies, this one was full of idiots as robbers and stupidity ruled. The latter is probably on purpose but it didn't make my experience any better since I didn't find it funny either.",6,3,7,15 July 2017
We're the Millers," Not my kind of fun
","Rude, dumb, predictable and without any creativeness. All the jokes are flat, with much cursing. Most of them are sex oriented but with a very cheap feel. Very immature.I can't say it was a total disaster, and It made me smile here and there, but not to laugh. I must also admit that people around me were actually laughing, though most of them were teenagers while I'm at my early thirties.My thing is smart unpredictable comedies. I loved the original 'Couplings', which is abundant with funny sex jokes with very mature feel. I guess this is just not my type of a movie.",4,14,28,15 September 2013
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," For every kid
","I didn't really wanted to see this movie. Why? Because I was 24 years old student who really grew up from this kind of movies. Luckily, that year I was involved in a project of helping problematic kids. So I had an eleven years old boy to look after. Naturally when we decided to go to the cinema together he was the one to choose the film. I won't describe the joy of the kid and just say that he loved it. As for me, I don't really remember when was the last time I liked a movie that was meant for kids. And maybe it's not because I grown up, but because of the movies that are made. To me this levels with such greats as 'Neverending Story' ( Only the original) and 'Thursday after rain'. Of course the visual effects of 'Prisoner of Azkaban' are awesome, and the colors are very unique and interesting but these are not the main points. This movie shows creativeness, imagination and kindness of heart which most of the movies lacks. One of the best in it's kind.",8,0,1,8 September 2005
Now You See Me," Lacks a tight grip.
","Incoherent and pointless. That's the two words for me to describe this movie. Absolute lack of charm in a movie demanding one. A 75 million dollar budget spent ridiculously. Both me and my girlfriend left the theater with a bad taste, feeling we have chosen the wrong movie to watch. I was deceived by the trailer, the relatively good IMDb rating and the majority of good reviews. I didn't expect a masterpiece (based on the reviews), but it turned out to be much worse.The plot has some originality and it's mildly entertaining throughout but never lifting, never intriguing and never building real suspense. So when the end came there was almost nothing to look for. The resolution was quite bad, very loose, having a weak logical connection to the rest of the plot. Unfortunately, because earlier parts of the movie never built any suspense, I wasn't even disappointed.I think the director is to blame for all of the movies' faults. First is the lack of details. Sure, some of the tricks are shown, but some are not (how did they have access to bank accounts? how did they show immediate change of numbers on paper?). Some of the scenes look very awkward and very unrealistic (the chase part, all the last show). The second fault is the focus on the characters. Upon reading the plot and seeing the trailer, I expected the magicians to be in the center of the plot, but the focus is clearly not on them. Their characters lack substance and I ended up not caring about them throughout the entire film. The third fault is the CGI and the flashy lights. There is not much of them, but when they are present, they are boring and redundant. They didn't try to make them interesting, but to fill some space. The fourth issue is regarding the plot. There is no clear balance of power between the characters. What are the motives of each characters? What stands behind their actions? And the one-line explanations at the end to those question is just not enough. There is a good amount of reviewers here praising the movie, and so the score is probably representing the average. However, in my opinion, anyone who likes the movies to have a strong logic, with down to earth approach and with things to be explained (and not just happen somehow), should skip this (at least at cinema). To make my point, I loved 'Prestige' and 'Oceans' 11' and I didn't like 'The Illusionist' for the reasons above.",4,1,2,27 July 2013
Batman Begins," You will enjoy it if you know what to expect from it.
","I already passed that age when I was naively watching superhero movies, and didn't think to comment on this movie at first place. I have changed my mind. This Batman movie clearly differs from the other. The plot is still childish and naive but it appears to be less comic then the others. The characters are more serious and the villains don't laugh. This contrast in the Batman series reminds me of the difference in Bond movies when Timothy Dalton played James Bond.Batman wasn't the main attraction in the previous movies. It's the villains that made it. Their characters showed the imagination and the creativeness of the makers of the movie. Each one of them had his own style and uniqueness while Batman stayed the same ( Well he acquired some help and a few vehicles during the series but it's not much of a difference comparing to the villains). This movie is about the Batman. The villains are barely noticeable, though they maintain the traditional originality in their distraction plan.The cast and the cinematography is beyond the expected, but the best thing about this movie is the music. It just keeps your breath on hold. In my opinion this is the best soundtrack ever been composed. Surely it's the one I noticed the most during the film. Hans Zimmer made a lot of good soundtracks before ( Rock, Broken Arrow, Drop Zone, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down ... ) but this one distinguishes itself beyond.",Null,0,1,2 October 2005
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Entertaining enough.
","It seems that all the franchises in Hollywood have become mixed up in the past ten years. Die Hard IV and and MI2 have disguised themselves as Bond movies, while the Bond series have shifted to a new role model, the Bourne franchise. I would actually feel more comfortable, if this movie would be sold for Bond (from Pierce Brosnan Era), then being MI4.MI4 is too exaggerated, much things left to chance, and it's unnecessarily funny.MI movies were always walking on the brink of reality. Having 'maybe existing', 'probably existing' or 'could be existing' gadgets. And same goes about the personal skill. MI4 has taken the clearly unbelievable path, having gadgets designed for Bond, and agents with Batman skills.When a man hits his head from a 1 story fall, he would probably end up in a hospital, skull fractures. With such logic chain, Ethan Hunt should have died several times during this film. This fact alone will give away the credibility for this movie.The chance factor has too much weight. There was actually no mission that was executed as planned. Too many faults occurring. One of them is actually accepting Benji as a field operative. Though he's funny, that's not what I've expected from MI4.Another, unusual detail in this movie, is that Tom Cruise character doesn't get angry. Showing his anger is one of Tom Cruises characters' trademarks, and appears in most of his movies (and all of the previous MIs). Most of these were because he took issues personally, which doesn't seem to exist in MI: Ghost Protocol. It also looks as if despite Ethans age, the action takes less effort from him, so he doesn't look so tense. On the other hand, maybe it's because he knows that the stunts are so unreal, and he's not trying to be too serious about it.Beyond the said above, it's entertaining and never boring. The Dubai scene is amazing. Both the mission plan and the action looks cool. And though the light, funny mood doesn't suit, based on previous installments, my expectation from MI, it is funny. So compensated fairly.MI3 was my favorite, having interesting missions, amazing action and a superb villain. MI2 had nothing beyond it's relatively good action. MI1 had great missions, an OK action but was too complicated. Considering, that the MI movies don't have a certain standard, MI4 is fine and worth it's cinema ticket.",6,2,6,17 December 2011
Hellboy," Entertaining
","I just wanted to see the beginning of Hellboy, to decide whether I should watch it in the future or not, but wasn't able to quit. Sure it's not a Great movie, but I still liked it and have some good words about it.First of all I liked the character of Ron Perlman. Hellboy is a funny, very cynic and very close to human character ( even with his superhero ability) that makes this dark movie a little bit lighter and funnier.Second is the direction. Hellboy looked good. Maybe it's not as solid as X-Men but it's still very entertaining to watch. The fights of Hellboy with Samael are awesome ( Much better than Alien with Predator ). The Effects are amazing and impressive even in today's abundance of superhero movies. Overall, for me Hellboy was a good way to spend two hours and I would recommend it to others.",7,1,1,19 April 2006
The Bourne Legacy," Entertaining
","I think it was a nice addition to the Bourne film series. Redundant? Maybe. Bad and unworthy of the previous installments? No way. Overall, i had a good time watching the movie so I'll start with what I think was bad and then proceed with the good in order to finish with a positive impression. The script in the first half of the movie is the weakest link. The decisions of the heads of the operations were very questionable and I had lots of whys and hows running in my head. Is all this massacre was necessary? How did Aaron find the Dr and at such perfect timing? The factor of chance was too apparent here. It's slightly surprising given the fact that the director wrote the script for all the movies in the seriesEric Byer's character could be better written. I don't think that Norton is the best choice for the role, but it's beyond that. His dialogues were quite clichéd. Again this is more noticeable in the first part of the move.The Good: pretty much everything else. The action is well choreographed, not too exaggerated and exactly in the right amount. Just like all the previous installments had. The leads, and most of the support actors were great. Aaron Cross is not a copycat of Jason Bourne but a different agent, and Renner does a very good role at doing this. The script turned out for the better in the second half, and the actions from the operations headquarters seemed much more logical.To sum it up, I found Bourne Legacy less coherent than the previous movies in the franchise. However; with a very good action, acting and pace it was a very entertaining movie.",7,1,2,24 August 2016
Mulholland Drive," The Most complicated movie I ever saw.
","I didn't understand this movie when I saw it, but I had a feeling that there is some logic in this movie. I had no patience to see it again, so I read some reviews to figure it out. What a mistake. This movie has a brilliant idea, that was perfectly retold when thinking of it backwards. All the details that I thought to be 'holes in the plot' during the movie, appeared to be the clues to it's solution. I guess I have underrated David Lynch as director (although this is his first movie that I saw). The cinematography and the soundtrack are truly awesome and stylish. I just wish it wasn't so complicated and would be a little bit more approachable.",8,0,1,9 September 2005
Logan," Overrated
","Without referencing the previous installments I think that the general plot line is good. So does the acting. All the other is quite mediocre. So while I don't think it's the worse x-men movie, I was disappointed. So what went wrong?Firstly, is the action. It just wasn't fun enough to watch. And apart of one car chase, it was very dull. There was nothing interesting or new. Brutality replaced choreography.Another issue is sloppiness. This relates to the useless army involved and jeopardizing the innocent. Another related question is how did they escape from the Hotel unnoticed?Finally, Logan was depressed all the way through the movie, without any recovery (or trying to recover) and being constantly on low energy. For me it was depressive (as much as for Logan himself).",5,5,12,10 May 2017
Three Colors: Blue," Stylish, beautiful,
","For me, this is the definition of an art movie. Minimal crew, confined spaces, slow pace. Deliberately choosing some key objects and constantly returning to them as for some symbolism. It reminded me of some earlier Ridley Scotts' movies and of some lynch movies, though without the shocking images. Beautiful Juliette Binoche plays, wonderfully, a beautiful, both inside and outside, woman. I have sympathized with her character. Both the idea of the movie and the point at the end are very clear, and portrayed very well. In contrast to other movies where we have some turn in the plot, here we have a turn (change) in the character. So this is mostly a character driven movie.There are lots of concentrations on blue chandelier, blue swimming pool, showing Julie relaxing herself. Such accent on the art made a compromise in the plot. So there was not much going on. For an hour and a half movie, it felt slightly longer than necessary. Still, it was beautiful and well played.",7,0,0,9 March 2014
Die Hard," Left it's permanent stamp on the movie industry
","This movie is one of the best action movies of all time. I won't repeat others on why this is such a good movie, I will just agree with them. What I will mention is the impact this movie left on the movie industry. Looking back at the 90's, you can see the influence it had, because this was something new. Die Hard was different from anything that had been done before that. This was a new style of action movies. I will give a small list of movies that were actually made by the receipt of Die Hard: Deadly Outbreak, Cyberjack, Sudden Death, Under Siege ( Originally, this was meant to be Die Hard 2), Under Siege 2, Air Force One, The Rock. I'm sure there's a lot more, some i don't know, some just can't think of. Everyone of this movies has the basic formula: Terrorist captures 'something'... There is ( sometimes there are) one (few) good guy (guys) in this 'something' that takes over it from within, while it takes him most of the film to do it ( I mean that he doesn't kill all the bad guys in the same time, thus Executive Decision doesn't fall in this category, but does it slowly throughout the whole length of the movie). Non of the listed above came close to Die Hard, though some of them were OK.",8,1,3,31 August 2005
Edge of Tomorrow," I wished the movie had lasted longer
","The plot is known from the trailer, half an hour through the movie you already know everything and the end is guessable. But getting to the end is very entertaining.The pace of the movie is perfect. No unnecessary scenes were repeated. You could clearly see how the plot advanced from A to B. And at the end, it felt short despite being almost 2 hours of length.The leads were perfect as well. They had the necessary on screen chemistry between them, and the difference of age was not so visible. I liked Emily Blunts' English accent, it sounds very sexy. As for Tom Cruise, he is the one who pulls it through. He just doesn't know how to disappoint.Visuals are fantastic. Aliens are very interesting and I found them to be quite original. Sometimes however, the camera movement was very quick, and it wasn't always clear what is happening during the fight. I saw the 3D version, which had its interesting additions but I don't think it's a must.Edge of Tomorrow doesn't have romance, which is quite unusual lately. Lead characters had an affection towards each other, but it didn't evolve beyond that. I thought it was good (no unbelievable love story in the middle of nowhere), but maybe that's why my wife wasn't as entertained as I am.",8,0,2,1 June 2014
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Yu-Pi-Ki-Yey
","After the wonderful first Die Hard, and a little silly but still decently made second one, comes the worst in the series (at least until now). It's not all bad. Definitely it has good moments: The main idea of this film when the bad guy tells good guy what to do, or else he blows something. The missions are truly funny (in a good way). The action is OK. Samuel Jackson plays his part well, and definitely contributes to this sequel. The opening scene is wonderful when Joe Cocker's version of Hot Town plays in the background and ... Explosion... we are officially entered to the plot of the movie, can take our seats and enjoy. OK, I did enjoy the movie's first hour and a half. And then it's like the director ran out of script and began to improvise. An online plot. And i'm not trying to find holes in the script, i'm trying to find the script in those holes.Common, John McClane, the guy who fights till his last breath ( though doing it in his take-it-easy Willis way ) is get caught here? And what, the bad guys spare him? I mean Simon Gruber spares him after everything McClane did for his brother, I'm sure he would like to see him dead. I'm repeating, SEE him dead.I Suppose Simon didn't like his brother ( actually he and McClane agreed on that) and decided to half-spare him. But of course McClane dies hard and ... well .. actually he didn't die ( he was needed for the good ending and apparently for the Die Hard 4. Although he could die, but then they would make Die Hard Zero, or Die Hard The Beginning. This would tell us about early Johnny McClane). Zeus Carver also dies hard, that means he also didn't die in the movie, although he should die on the boat explosion cause his last scene was totally unnecessary.After The police finds out the 'bad guys'' location they go to get them, and what do you think of Zeus Carver ( Samuel Jackson). He also goes with them, he flies with McClane on same chopper to get the 'bad guys'. He must have been registered to the police force during the flight though the director didn't show us the flight itself. I still don't get what Zeus did on that chopper.He intended to shout at the villains? It must have been so. Maybe he has an ultrasonic voice that can damage the surroundings? Anyway the director was late about this, cause McClane already killed the 'bad guys'. He hit the electricity cable with his revolver from something like 90 feet and the cable hit the chopper where Simon was.End of story. Wait a minute. Did I tell you how the police finds the 'bad guys'? No first, how did they loose them. 17 Trucks full of gold, one after the other in a row, driving silently, unnoticed, in the streets of New York. Yeh, sure they are. Who can possibly think someone would notice them? The only logical explanation i find is that each of the trucks was in a garage where they made a new color and fixed the engine (GTA). OK so the dumb police looses the trucks and smart McClane, after 2 hours of sweat chaises and fights where he was almost killed in an explosion and solved a logic riddle while saving many innocent citizens' lives, he finally finds 'the bad guys'. McClain looks at an aspirin bottle that Gruber gave him before, sees where it was manufactured, and realizes that there must be the 'bad guys' where. Can you believe it? You can? Oh no, most of romantic stories don't go that far. Consider Serendipity: girl writes on a book, throws it and if this book somehow finds the man she loves then they must be meant for each other. Now Die Hard : With Vengeance : Simon Gruber gives John McClane a bottle of aspirin that finally causes McClane to find him because in all the places Simon could hide, he chose the address on that bottle. See it as a sequel to the first two ( if you saw them).",6,0,1,31 August 2005
X-Men: First Class," Very very rushed.
","Matthew Vaughn doesn't have the class of Brian Singer. X-men: first class is not the worst installment (I would honor X-Men origins: Wolverine with this title) but considering the standards set by the first two X-Men movies, it is quite a flop.Aside from repetitive patterned script, stupid moments and inconsistencies regarding the previous installments it tried to close all loose ends and to explain everything. It seems that the writers (one of which is the director) didn't have the long vision. They didn't think about spanning some of the events on several movies, building relationships so when they break them, it would be believable. Instead, everything is thrown at once. How Charles and Erik meet, how Erik/Magneto becomes the bad guy, Charles' injury (and more pieces on Beast and Mystique). So, considering the plot and the large portion of action, there is not much depth in the friendship of Erik and Charles. And worst of all is that half of these loose end closing occurs at the last 10 minutes. So it seemed very rushed and unbelievable.The bright spot is the majority of the cast. McAvoy and January Jones were very good. Fassbender is absolutely fantastic.",5,1,2,25 May 2014
Gladiator," don't deserve the credit it got.
","When I saw the movie in the theater for the first time I said it was OK. Not a great movie but worth seeing. Of course this is mainly for the battles that are amazing. And the score to the movie is fair enough. But I had a feeling that there is something wrong with this movie. It seemed that this is a replica of Braveheart. Only in Braveheart I got emotional without wanting it and in Gladiator I wanted to but I couldn't, It just wasn't so. The next time I saw it on DVD I noticed that each time I waited for the fights, because everything else is dumb. The plot unveils in turtle pace, the dialogs are over dramatic, it just like all the characters will burst with tears in minute after they say something. The most annoying thing is the plot itself. The characters look very unrealistic and unconvincing, a lot of time is wasted on unnecessary talk and the end can be predicted from the beginning.Well, a little bit of history for the end. There was an Emperor Marcus Aurelius that was considered as a 'good' emperor, that ended the era of 'the five good emperors'. His son that succeeded him was Commodus ( just like in the movie ), but he's not killed his father. Marcus Aurelius died from a disease. Commodus himself was an excellent fighter. He fought with his father in the north, and after he became an emperor he tested himself each time in the coliseum arena with the gladiators and the beasts, and won each and every battle. Commodus killed by an athlete called Narcissus in his bath. Commodus considered himself a god and wanted people to think of him the same which can be viewed as insanity but for sure he wasn't weak and Coward as he was portrayed in the movie. He also ruled for 12 years, something that the movie doesn't count for.One commercial movie for Ridley Scott, but definitely one of the dumbest he made ( there is always G.I.Jane for this title ). Go see Alexander. Much closer to history, much better movie.",5,2,4,19 August 2005
Donnie Darko," slightly overrated
","Truly a good movie. This movie is interesting to watch throughout all of it. Interesting plot, very good pace and great actors. Specially Jake Gyllenhaal that makes a very convincing performance of his not so easy character. Plus the support of some more known actors like Mary Mcdonnell, that plays awesome, Drew Barrymore and Patrick Swayze in good performances.The main idea of the movie is maybe not an original one, but it's execution is definitely different from anything that is done before. The main disadvantage of this movie is that it comes in a period of lots of other movies like it: Sixth Sense, Memento, Frequency, Butterfly Effect, Mulholland Drive, Identity, Heaven(1998) and probably some more. All these have non-standard storytelling and most of them have twist in the end. Which makes all of them better than average ( maybe except Identity) but naturally not equal among themselves. Donnie Darko also has shortcomings in inconsistency of the plot. No major holes, and nothing noticeably disturbing but after the end twist some question arise, and some remain unanswered.My personal subjective opinion places Donnie Darko below Frequency, which is far more breathtaking and compelling, Sixth Sense, whose twist is far more shocking and the plot is much more consistent and Mulholland Drive, that has superb storytelling, wonderful soundtrack and a down to earth realistic story. Not impressive as those three but better than most like it and far better than any average movie.",7,4,7,22 September 2005
The Great Gatsby," Simply Beautiful
","I saw the 3D version of The Great Gatsby yesterday and it was such a beautiful movie. The costumes, the music, the views and the general atmosphere of the movie were just amazing. I did have some prejudice against this movie because 1) This is one of my two favorite novels and I didn't want to see it ruined, and 2) The IMDb scores for The Great Gatsby are relatively low for that kind of movie. Moreover, reading the reviewers ratings, gave me the impression that this score should be corrected downwards. However, my girlfriend , who didn't read the novel, wanted to see The Great Gatsby more than other available movies in the cinema.I can't say the movie lived entirely to my expectation from the novel, because the novel has some depths that the movie doesn't possess. There is a sub-context and a meaning that F.S.Fitzgerald had gave to the book, and it's slipped from Baz Luhrmanns' adaptation.Someone noted here that the director has managed to cover about 75% of the novel. I think I could easily give it another 10 and say that the movie was true to about 85% of the book. All the characters, except for Nick, were perfectly matched and played amazingly. The only complain from my side was about Tobey Maguire, who looked slightly immature for the role of Nick. It was very visible at the beginning, but it got better as the movie progressed. It's not only that the director has matched the novel well, he has mostly matched my imagination of the views, Gatsbys' castle, Nicks' rented house, character look, cars and so on. In cases he didn't match my imagination, he outdone it. Some scenes were so beautifully done I couldn't even imagine it. And the 3D experience has only augmented my joy of watching The Great Gatsby. Some context has been lost, but it's very true to the story and there is also value added (the visuals and the sound). Beautiful movie.",8,2,5,23 May 2013
