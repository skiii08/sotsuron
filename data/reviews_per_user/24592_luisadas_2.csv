Blade Runner 2049," I've seen things you people wouldn't believe
","I've seen things you people wouldn't believeMaybe it was boosted by the IMAX experience, but I was hyperventilating.Visually, Blade Runner 2049 is a gorgeous, goose bumping, dazzling, mind-blowing, revamped and upgraded version of original aesthetic of Blade Runner.And it has been done in an honored and respectful way:1. We still felt that same neo-noir immersive sensation with the drizzling rain, huge shadowy buildings, neon billboards and flying cars through the misty night over an endless cyberpunk city.2. Hans Zimmer got us as close as possible to classic Vangelis music score (still the men to worship). Even the ending scene uses the exact same track ('Tears in Rain') for the Rutger Hauer's epic monologue.3. The audio archives of the dialogues between Deckard and Rachael, Rachael's picture and newly made replicant, short appearance of Edward James Olmos ('Gaff') and details go even to the hair and makeup of the girls.4. Harrison Ford, whose appearance represents, besides real human charisma, the decisive link to the original movie.However, the not so good parts of the movie are:1. The main relationship of the movie: Ryan Gosling (as 'K') and its stunning virtual girlfriend - Joi - an A.I. technological gadget. Because of this, the movie looks too focused on a theme that some other movies (like Her or A.I.) already went through: how technology and artificial intelligence can be ultimately enhanced to match humans. 2. There's too much time dedicated to Jared Leto (as Wallace) - a typical clichéd comics villain, which I think it is a misfit with the 'Blade Runner world'.3. The movie has some slow progression parts, that can make us look at our watch and then it seems that, suddenly, there was no time left – it rushes to a short and compressed ending, that could have been much more exhaustive (I am hoping for a 'Directors/Final Cut').It's not a perfect movie but, at least, I really saw things you people wouldn't believe...",9,6,13,9 October 2017
Prometheus," Finally... a better love story than Twilight!
","This is the sum up of some reviews and also my opinion.Pros: 1. Breathtaking Scenarios (H.R. Giger). And the probes? Technology of the future! Spectacular!Cons: 1. Too many concepts immersed in the film in a hurry and not adequately explored.a) Scene about the 'Reign' the old man's Weyland (Guy Pearce) with Vickers (Charlize). For what?b) Intimate and emotional talk between husband and wife about children. For what?c) Conflict with the old man's and android (Michael Fassbender). For what?d) First scene between Millburn and Fifield (Rafe Spall and Sean Harris). For what?e) The old man decides to say that he is dead and then is alive after all! For what? But why? What a simple and stupid final twist!2. Childish script (at least) and a lot of clichés. Movie to please the masses: not an intellectual film, raw and noir as we expected from Ridley Scott. It's a 'cool teen movie' and that children will also like.a) Android is not supposed to have feelings but, occasionally, has. We see decisions that seem random and then decisions that seem deliberate and thoughtful! Completely incoherent. How to compare this erratic, inconsistent and no credible behavior with Bishop (Aliens)?!?b) 'It's too late! Kill me! '(Charlie Holloway at the entrance of the spaceship). OMG!c) Surgical operations that cuts through the whole abdomen area and then she can run and jump only with staples and anesthetics!? At least put some super-advanced technology to heal and restore the cut! She could not even move with a cut like that! c2) the best machine in the history of mankind: was only made for men... d) Who created humans? What a profound question! And now the same guys who created us want to kill us! But they can not use a bomb! No way! Dangerous genetic material that they can't even deal with! Otherwise it is no fun!e) The first two characters who die (Millburn and Fifield). They have so little intelligence as credibility as characters! First they completely panic and want to go away all alone just because they saw a giant fossil! Then... when they find an alien in the form of sly snake, it's a funny animal and want to play with it!e2) is still the same ... despite all the technology (including the spectacular probes) they were lost! HAHAHAHAHA! What!? f) The scientist found their creators because 'It's what she chooses to believe'. WOW! g) I've never seen a captain and his crew (especially these) wanting to commit suicide so quickly, with such ease and with a smile on they faces! At least show us some internal mental conflict or between them when taking the decision!h) After so much that just happened out-there they decide to immediately open the doors of the spaceship just because 'someone knocked on the door'! I can already imagine the kids screaming in the theater: 'No! DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR! OH NO! THEY OPENED IT! SO STUPID!'i) One of the best: 'I'll take the helmet off! I can not take it anymore.' Yes, he risked his life against possible biological contamination only because there was oxygen in the air and because the helmet 'was itching!'... But... what is this?j) There is no kind of TENSION in any of the GORE scenes ... nothing! There is practically no moments that we stick to the screen or that make us shiver.k) Scene of the android playing with nice and beautiful technology is absolutely ridiculous ... just to look 'cool'.. What is the need of that charade? How about just a button to raise the ship and another to blow up a planet?!? It takes all these nonsense? This is not SCI-FI! It's a masquerade! It's Sci-Fi for kids!l) The desire to make a film full of mystery and (pseudo-deepness) just made the script unattached.m) the largest expedition ever in the history of humanity evolving trillions of dollars and they take two scientists (who take off their helmets first time they 'think it is fine') plus 5 or 6 stooges. Right. n) The deduction in 3 seconds: the scientist looks at the head: 'foreign cells' (wow!) and decide to get some electricity instantly. just because.3. Characters have no charisma and representation is mediocre / bad / very bad!a) Incomprehensible to give the lead to Noomi Rapace... compare the acting quality with Sigourney Weaver...b) Dialogue is dull and no credibility at all. does not convince anyone! c) even Charlize does a bad job! Within the total mediocrity, the prize for the less bad (even with the inconsistencies of script) goes to the Fassbender. Still, Lance Henriksen (Bishop) and Ian Holm (Ash) had better performances.4. Weak 3D effects! Serves no purpose! I took the glasses very often because it was more uncomfortable than cool. Characterization of the old guy is scary... How about hiring actually an old men rather than Guy Pearce?'Prometheus' is an example of modern cinema and that Ridley Scott surrendered: all about money, sacrificing intellectual script and the acting quality. Broaden the film to most of the ages and use appealing CGI visuals, clichés and simple emotional elements.Conclusion: Prometheus is a better love story than Twilight!",2,2,3,6 March 2013
