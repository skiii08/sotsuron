The Blair Witch Project," Very annoying & disappointing
","Highly promoted as 'scary as hell,' this independent film of three student filmmakers who disappear mysteriously in the Maryland woods while trying to find the alleged Blair Witch is extremely disappointing.  There is no acting ability whatsoever, unless you consider Donahue being annoying as acting. The few 'scary' moments are not at all scary, and the camerawork is pointless. Only rent it if you're desperate. Gets *1/2 out of ****.",Null,0,1,2 September 2000
Chinatown," A must see for film noir fans
","Engrossing film noir type mystery set in 1937 Los Angeles, with  a private eye hired to follow a man of power who is suspected of adultery, but stumbles across a strange cover-up involving water supply and a young girl. The cast is simply marvelous headed by Nicholson, Dunaway & Huston, along with a superlative music score, and Oscar-winning screenplay makes this a classic.  Sequel made in 1990: The Two Jakes.",Null,0,2,13 July 2003
Se7en," Very disturbing, but worth while
","Gripping, well-written psychological thriller of two New York City police detectives (Pitt & Freeman) trying to solve the murders of one serial killer who patterns them after the seven deadly sins.   Unique chiller has some unbearable, gory moments, but the ending will make it worth your while.",Null,0,2,2 September 2000
North by Northwest," The Best of all the Hitchcock Thrillers
","This is certainly one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest suspense/thrillers he made in the United States.  Why he wasn't at least nominated for the Best Director Academy Award for this is unbelievable.  It is a bit long, but attention-holding story of business executive Grant on the lamb from two spies who think he is a secret government agent, and then becomes wanted by the law for a murder he did not commit.  During this ordeal, he falls in love with the beautiful Eva Marie Saint.  Of course, this is the one in which Grant fights for his life against the airplane in a crop-dusting field, and the one where the riveting finale occurs on the peak on Mount Rushmore.  Four stars!",Null,0,0,30 July 2001
The Exorcist," Breakthrough horror film
","If you read my other film reviews and comments, you can pretty much tell I like older films. Recently, I have been getting into more of the classics from the 1970s and 1980s. In particular, I do enjoy the horror films and thrillers and believe it or not, I finally got around to see 'The Exorcist' this past fall season. I have had a few opportunities to see this movie on TV or rent it, but just never did. Seeing it on TV, I am sure I missed most of the controversial content that was a taboo in 1973, but still some of the scenes are pretty shocking and unforgettable even by today's standards. Linda Blair and Ellen Burstyn literally went through 'hell' in making this, both suffered injuries and were put through grueling preparation for some scenes. The special effects are pretty good and the voice of the devil, which was done by 1950s actress Mercedes McCambridge was believable. I read she had to sew Warner Brothers because they originally did not give her credit as the demonic voice.",Null,1,2,12 December 2004
Dog Day Afternoon," Brilliant, one of the best New York movies
","A truly amazing and brilliant drama with Pacino in one of his greatest roles as a married man with children, who holds up a Brooklyn bank so he can pay for his lover's sex-change operation.  If it sounds amusing to you, it certainly is, but this film is filled with lots of drama and tense moments along with some laughs.  Being focused on one specific location and story, one would think it would be boring, but this manages to grab your attention all the way through until an exciting, semi-predictable finale.  Keep in mind that this really happened in August 1972.",Null,1,2,8 August 2001
The Game," Very unique, clever film
","Enjoyable film about a lonely millionaire (Douglas) who receives a strange birthday gift from his brother (Penn) that puts his life in danger. This film will certainly hold your attention, since it is loaded with action, adventure, and all sorts of psychological twists, but the overall plot is totally implausible.",Null,0,1,4 September 2000
The Graduate," One of my new favorites
","Hoffman (in his second feature film) plays Ben, a recent college graduate who is uncertain about his future.  He spends his summer bumming around, relaxing in his father's luxurious pool, and being seduced by older & married Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), whose husband is Ben's father's best friend.  After all that, he becomes infatuated with the Robinson's young daughter.  This is certain a timeless & classic comedy of the 60s with the unforgettable and certainly fitting soundtrack by Simon & Garfunkel, memorably 'Here's to You, Mrs. Robinson.'  4 out of 4.",Null,0,1,27 August 2001
Rosemary's Baby," Classic horror, but not really scary
","This is certainly a chilling tale, but don't expect to jump from your seat or scream.  It is scary in a different fashion, because you know what is going on, but all of it is not displayed on the screen. 'Rosemary's Baby' is a very odd, but brilliantly unfolded story revolving around a young New York couple (Farrow & Cassavetes).  She is desperate to have a baby, he desperate for success as an actor.  Their neighbors are a lovable, but peculiar couple, who just happen to be Satan worshippers. You can figure the rest out without me spoiling it for you.  Ruth Gordon, in an Oscar-winning role as 'Minnie' is just one reason to watch this.  Earns 4 stars.",Null,0,0,30 July 2001
Halloween," One of my favorite horror films of all time!
","Masked serial killer Michael Myers, who murdered on Halloween as a young child fifteen years earlier, escapes from mental hospital only to stalk Curtis (in film debut) and her friends on Halloween. Not what you expect for a low-budget horror film.  This might be quite hair-raising for some to watch, especially late Halloween night.  Followed by numerous sequels.  One of my personal favorites in the horror genre!",Null,0,0,1 September 2000
Saboteur," Along the lines of North By Northwest
","A plot that Alfred Hitchcock would use many times again, most memorable in 'North By Northwest' seventeen years later. Robert Cummings is wrongly suspected of being the saboteur who blew up the plant where he worked.  He then goes on a cross-country run from his enemies, encountering a beautiful girl, a traveling circus (the unforgettable bearded-lady), etc.  This is another odd Hitchcock film, but very well done, especially the climax atop The Statue of Liberty (shades of Grant on Mount Rushmore).  Earns three stars.",Null,0,2,31 July 2001
