The Equalizer," Let me tell you why I love this
","As we all know just from the drive to work that the world is full of sh*theads and I love a film that shows the 'underdog' kicking their a**.This film has it in spades. Think 300 vs the Persians with B and Q or Homebase (UK reference) thrown in.Please, please, please make a sequel, prequel or any other quel and I'll watch it. Denzil you were awesome.Perhaps the worst review ever but I loved this film, perhaps you can tell?From a review point of view I would perhaps liked to have seen the scenes where Denzil gets the ring back for the checkout assistant or a few scenes from where he enters the Russian baddies home but I also have to admit that it did set the scene for Denzil's character.",10,0,9,13 December 2014
