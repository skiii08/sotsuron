The Incredible Hulk," My favorite depiction of hulk
",Never understood why the didn't make the current hulk as badass as this one. I've seen this movie so many times since hulks one of my favorite characters and it doesn't get old. It shows the hulk ferocity without making him look too much like an ape. Will always be one of my favorite movies.,10,1,1,11 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Doesn't fit with MCU
","Feels like a forced addition to the MCU. Im a huge marvel fan, including both the comics and movies and this just doesn't feel like a necessary movie at all. Small details like how fury lost his eye or where the avengers got their name from infuriate me. On top of this the acting felt stale, or maybe it was just the pompous attitude of Brie Larson. This movie definitely doesn't sit well with me at all but if it was a stand alone and had nothing to do with the MCU then it wouldn't but as bad (Still pretty bad though).",3,2,5,11 June 2019
The Green Mile," Amazing Movie.
","Doesn't matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old. I'm no professional critic but this is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen.",10,1,2,11 June 2019
