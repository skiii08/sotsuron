Sucker Punch," One of the worst movies ever
","The imagery and all other visuals are outstanding. It has some of the sexiest young starlets nowadays. But I really felt like punching Director Zack Snyder, and it's was the best way to describe what I felt after watching this movie. It really sucks, if I am allowed to use this word on this forum. (Sorry if I'm not)The script is a mix between any of the dark Tim Burton's animated films and a French movie like 'Last tango in Paris', promising so much and giving a harsh and uncomfortable amount of disappointment. Somewhere when the film was running, I had the strange sense of reading a Hindu mythology book that gives a lot of hints but ultimately leading you nowhere.I'm so sorry I have wasted my time, instead of watching a master piece of film just like 'Citizen Kane'.",2,4,11,6 January 2014
