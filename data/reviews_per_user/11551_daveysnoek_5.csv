Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Great great movie, just an inch below Pulp Fiction.
","everything I missed in part 1 was made up here (the famous Tarantino dialouge was back) I was also glad this film was less gory than it's predecessor. and Bill's dead - which some people thought was disappointing - was very well executed. I mean, if she just had sliced him to pieces it wouldn't have been as emotional as it is now. Bill just walks away and falls down slowly.The role that Michael Madsen played was small, but awesome. The Pai Mei bit was excellent (tarantino said his next film will be in this style, so I'm already looking forward to it) Daryl Hannah was convincing as the bitch Elle Driver. And some pieces were Hilarious. (The Pai Mei bit, The eyeball between the toes, Budd's wakey, wakey eggs and bakey line) The absolute star in this film was David Carradine, to me he looked like a father figure, a wise Indian. Cunning and intelligent. Uma Thurman (who isn't really one of my favorite actresses) was fabulous and convincing in the emotional area.I rate this film a 9.",9,0,1,20 February 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Everything in this room is *eat*able. Even I'm *eat*able. But that is called cannibalism, my dear children, and is in fact frowned upon in most societies.
","When I first heard about this project I thought Burton went nuts. I just couldn't see him do Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for some reason. But boy, I was wrong. This is an extremely entertaining film and one of the best of 2005! Johnny Depp gives an excellent eccentric performance as the strange Willy Wonka. Freddy Highmore is very good as Charlie Bucket and I expect him to have a beautiful movie career. All the other actors are great too. The characters violet Beaugard, Mike Teevee and (especially) Augustus Gloop are spot on. But the biggest show stealer of this film has to Deep Roy who deserves a lot of respect for playing ALL the Oompa Loopa's. The music is truly fabulous and the Oompa Loompa songs are so much fun (It really sounds like some kind of tribe music). This is one of Danny Elfman's finest scores. And that says a lot. Production design is truly magnificent. Bright colours and unique visuals everywhere. Eye candy - literally.Tim Burton proves he is one of Hollywood's most talented filmmakers. You will walk out with a ear to ear smile on your face.",9,1,3,18 October 2005
The Departed," A triumph
","Scorsese spend a lot of years lingering on different projects. Gangs of new York was okay, The aviator was quite good but every fan of Marty was secretly hoping for a new crime flick from the master. And this is the one! The Departed is brilliant. Absolutely stunning. Like Goodfellas, it's one of those rare movies where everything just..works. The acting is amazing. I was never a big fan of Leo DiCaprio but the performance he gives in this changed that. His character is very well developed and you feel for him right away. Matt Damon gives a surprising turn as a underhanded moll infiltrating the police. And of course there is Jack Nicholson in a blistering performance. Jack radiates menace, madness and charisma as Irish mob boss Frank Costello. A true legend at work. And he hasn't lost his touch. There is a reason for his 12 academy award nominations. And for this he will undoubtedly get his thirteenth.In the supporting roles Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin deliver the goods. Wahlberg is a scene stealer with some of the best lines and he has fabulous chemistry with both Sheen and Baldwin. Ray Winstone also shines as Costello's right hand man, Mr French. His part in this movie is overlooked in many reviews. But it is a golden one.The crew knocked this out of the park once again. The camera-work looks effortlessly smooth and Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is impeccable. To top it off there is a very strong soundtrack with the indestructible Scorsese-favorite Gimme Shelter.The Departed is Scorsese rising back to the up. even though he was never really away.",10,3,6,22 November 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One of the best movies Ever made.
","This is truly one of the best films ever made. While watching this movie it never feels like you are watching actors. It's very natural and subtle. The first portion of the movie is hilarious with excellent performances of Jack Nicholson, Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, William Redfield, Brad Dourif and Louise Fletcher. You really get involved with the characters and will love them. This part is followed by some of the most heartbreaking scenes ever. Which will give you goosebumps every time you watch it again. This movie is without a doubt very much recommended.",10,1,3,20 May 2005
Goodfellas," Mob Masterpiece
","Watching Goodfellas is a rare experience. The characters, their lifestyle and tone of the film suck you in and will not let you go. Goodfellas contains flawless acting with Ray Liotta who shines as the shy, modest gangster who doesn't really fit in between the ball breaking tough guys. His performance is outrageous yet subtle. Like Joe Carnahan said: Ray Liotta can say more with one look in his eyes than other actors can with a 5 minute monologue. Joe Pesci is hilarious and very disturbing as the aggressive Tommy DeVito. He is like a ticking timebom without display; you can't predict when he's going to explode. Robert DeNiro is scary but likable as Jimmy Conway and the other actors like Paul Sorvino are excellent and really contribute to the overall feel of the film.Goodfellas truly delivers on every aspect of film-making; acting, soundtrack (with ''Layla'' and ''Sunshine of your love'' being the most memorable) editing (The chaos that Henry goes through on his last day as a wiseguy is one of the best edited scenes ever)Highly recommended.",10,0,2,16 October 2005
