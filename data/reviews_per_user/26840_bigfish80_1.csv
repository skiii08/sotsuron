Lucky Number Slevin," The greatest movie ever........
","This is the best movie I've ever seen, bar-none. There needs to be more information posted on the web about 'The Kansas City Shuffle.' The performances put on by all of the actors in this movie is superb, and the actual story line for this movie goes above and beyond what a good story line is. This was an excellent movie in every way and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will not go into depth about what the movie is about, because I refuse to ruin it for anyone who wants to go see the movie. This is definitely the kind of flick that you don't want to miss, nor do you want take a bathroom break during the show while watching it. Hopefully this sums up my approval for the movie. I rated the movie a 10 out of 10. Make sure you go and see this movie as you will not be disappointed. This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again. It is also the kind of movie that raises the bar in the movie industry.",10,0,6,30 April 2006
