Hereditary," The Geezenstacks
","The film here is reminiscent of the episode, 'The Geezenstacks' on Tales from the Darkside. I believe their treatment of spiritual domestic presence is more horrific than in Hereditary. The drawback of this film is its 'noticeable' qualities. We notice the effects as production rather than as in story, such as the built sets. The sounds were a good example of this noticeable quality, but the horror elements, staging, fear of strangers, were too shown to us. I'm sure the filmmaker reads these reviews, so take note to give the audience subdued horror than predictable. I'd review this lower, but your effort should be given a minimal six.",6,0,1,3 November 2018
