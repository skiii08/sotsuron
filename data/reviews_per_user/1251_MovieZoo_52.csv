The New World," The New World wows with wonder and beauty
","I'll cut right to the end of the journey that is this review. I wanted to give it a 10 but didn't because of the ending. The ending should have followed the path the rest of the movie took. It is only because they got to the end and seemingly just decided to succumb to destiny that I did not give it a 10. The movie started out so beautifully, I almost began to wonder if National Geographic had actually found a time machine and went back to the time of Pochahontas. And while the scenery was beautiful, I am not referring only to the scenery being beautiful. I truly felt the movie's intent was to make the viewer believe he/she was being born into this time in history - acknowledging the presence of wondrous scenery and the mystery of humanity.I found it hard to compare it with any other movie I have ever seen. Try to remember the days of your innocence and you may find the same feelings while watching The New World.No performer performed so beautifully as Q'Orianka Kilcher. I will be disappointed if she doesn't at least get nominated for teen awards next year. Neither Colin Farrell nor Christian Bale impressed me but I do believe it was intentional to make their characters less attractive than Pochahontas.Just remember when you see this movie, if you want to enjoy and understand it, view it as you are just being introduced to a new world for the first time. Q'Orianka Kilcher will take you along with her gladly.BTW, the violence is nearly nothing more than gratuitous so don't expect violence to provide satisfaction.Beautiful job, Terrence Malick!!",9,3,8,21 January 2006
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 and all is well, DAMN WELL!
","When a western is made, it seems a wind blows by carrying whispers of discontent and doubt. Words you hear will be like, 'Why?', 'Who cares?', 'So what?', etc.In my mind, any doubt was definitely blown away. What a great movie! It is not that I like westerns, but I love good movies. As movies go, this western will go down as one of the best made.Why great? Bale and Crowe for one thing. These two fantastic actors got a chance to show their stuff and spared no bullets in the process. The chemistry worked as good as any chemistry can. Everyone worked as well together as expected from any great movie. Well enough that you may want to take your favorite hanky.You get the best of good and the best of evil. The writing was done well enough to make good and evil become like a dust storm clouding the obvious.The type of action you get is not going to surprise you at all - it's what all westerns are made with. But the way that it is done is hard to match. I never saw the original version so I cannot compare this to that. But when it comes to violence and action you can compare this to any of the best westerns out there.I give it 8 out of 10 and will definitely see this one again.",8,3,6,7 September 2007
Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette - pop-art pleasure for minimal measure
","I went to this movie knowing I was going to hear some non-period music so I expected a sort of long-play music video. From the trailer, I also expected some beautiful visuals Â– nice color of clothing and such.You get a taste of what it must have been like by being dragged along on a slow ride in a carriage. Look out the window, get some sleep, play a game, look out the window, get some sleep. Wow, that was interesting. Great if you want to be reminded that not every generation had fast cars, planes or trains. Who would have guessed? OK, enough of the sarcasm. You will need to be ready for a slow pace. Enjoy the nuances in color, music and clothing. Accept this movie for what it is, pop-art. It is not much more than that and, unfortunately, not great pop-art.I feel there has to be strength in relationships. Normally I would think Coppola would want the same since she did such a great job of it in Lost In Translation. I think the difference between the two movies is, it was easy to relate to someone in LIT but MA was lacking in that area. I could not relate to anyone. Matter of fact, I didn't want to relate to anyone.Don't worry about history beyond grade-school levels, it doesn't matter. I think if Coppola wanted to stick to a history lesson, she would have been making a movie that does not fit her style. So, I am proud of her for sticking to her own style, but she really needed to give us more than a stylized, long-playing music video. Marie may have truly been a very interesting person, but it was not finalized in the movie. She looked interesting, she began to get more interesting, but like her husband, I lost interest.I hate to say this was not worth the money, because it really started off with some very appealing ideas, but before it was all over for Marie, it was all over for the movie-goer. It definitely is NOT over for Kirsten Dunst. She is a beautiful actress and pulls off playing a 15 year old beautifully as well as a 30+ mother. But not even Kirsten can save Marie.",5,0,2,27 October 2006
Star Trek," Star Trek: Great Galactic Glory
","WOW, being a Star Trek fan is good again! Pine as Kirk: Not a clone of Shatner, but often engages his 'Kirk-isms'. With his mannerisms, intonement and posturing, he often did resemble Shatner but definitely made his own Kirk.Quinto as Spock: Again, not a clone. Definitely a great choice as Spock, especially a youthful Spock who is learning how to be human and Vulcan, merging logic with emotion. Quinto also perfectly puts to use some terrific mannerisms which were made famous by Nimoy.Urban as Bones: If only DeForest Kelley could have seen this movie... Urban was spot on PERFECT as Bones. Everything he did was an homage to DeForest Kelley. And there was nothing wrong with that.The movie may have failed without them. But I will say not one single performer did a bad job. Bana as Nero, Greenwood as Pike, Zoe Saldana(excuse me while I drool) as Uhura, Pegg as Scotty, Cho as Sulu, Yelchin as Chekov were all as perfect can be. Leonard Nimoy could just stand around and be given credit for his performance as the elder Spock, but thankfully, he did more than that. I cannot leave this one out, Chris Hemsworth as James Kirk's father was fantastic! For what little time he had in the movie, what a great job of portraying the brave father of a newly born legend! He blew me away.The brilliant use of current movie making technology gave us hopeful insight to future technology without drawing us back into our 'viewership' status. To me, the escapism we often seek in movies like this drew me into the very core of this alternate reality created by Gene Roddenberry and revived by J J Abrams. Abrams, who has admitted not being a fan of the TV series(probably because he had other things going on), latched onto all the gimmicks, gadgetry and glory of this 'old friend' from days gone by and made them new - a 'genesis' of sorts. The old sounds and old visuals were enhanced and made to feel new. Putting it all together the way everyone did, this was as good as it gets.My hopes for the next Star Trek movie consist of holding onto the camaraderie and technology with subtle and relative humor, not going overboard for the laughs as old Star Trek sometimes did. That said, I loved all the attempts for laughter in this movie. It was acceptable here because it was Star Trek coming home after being gone for an eternity.Perfect is as perfect does and perfect gets 10/10",10,2,13,9 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Inglorious indeed
","I have never gone to a Tarentino movie expecting great things. Matter of fact, the only Tarentino directed movie I enjoyed was Reservoir Dogs. That movie was solid all the way through. Except for a few scenes, everything was connected. Basterds, is the first one that I had hopes for. So much for hopes and dreams.I didn't get enough of Pitt. He had the best 'interesting' character that anyone could stay attached to. Christoph Waltz's Colonel Landa was definitely interesting and scary at first but soon lost my interest when he became inconsistent and clownish - not something you want from the lead baddie who, at first, appeared devious, evil, and unpredictable. Everyone else had their 15 seconds of fame and then wiped themselves off my memory.The movie had too much talk(is there such a thing as gratuitous boring talk?). A true Tarentino obsession. I got bored during most of the conversations. It seemed intentional. Was that to distract from the occasional blood-lust? Yeah, it was bloody, and I got the dark humor in it, but it was clumsy. The best scene was near the end which occurred at a theater and affected the audience in a dark and disturbing way.The best the movie had to offer was some great imagery and choreography but nothing that should earn anyone any awards. What killed that was the lack of emotional attachment. Really, when I think about it, this movie came across more as a study of Coen brother movie-making and failing to achieve anywhere near that level. Is Tarentino trying to imitate them? There is no way to talk anyone out of seeing this movie so I won't try. However, it is doubtful I will ever consider seeing another Tarentino film.3/10",3,18,53,21 August 2009
Iron Man 2," Iron-Man 2: Stark raving mad over Favreau's folly
","All these months of waiting on Iron Man 2 and my worst fears have been realized. You can rest assured that I am not going to glorify any of what I saw because I feel like I owe it to anyone or anything or because I was happy with at least a small part of the movie.This was like Spider-Man 3 or Superman 4 Quest for Peace. It was only a shell of a superhero movie. Why any time was spent on Tony's ailment, is a puzzle to me. Why? Because so much time is spent showing us that no ego is stronger than his.How can anyone care that he is sick? I know I didn't. Nothing endeared him to me. His self centered, near sighted outlook on life made me sick. His overinflated ego is the near death of my interest in this franchise. It is not Downey's fault, although I still wish he had not been selected as Stark in the first place.It had plenty of boom and bang tempered with ooh and ahh. Unfortunately for fans of the noise, it was short-lived in two different parts of the movie. For me, I don't care how loud the noise is or bright the flashes are as long as they are used intelligently. In my mind, that was the only thing that Favreau decided to give the fans, apparently not knowing we are not all like he is. To help you understand how much Favreau disappointed me, his presence on the screen repulsed me. When he decided to put his character in one fight scene, all I could think of was how little he must have understood what makes a superhero movie a good movie. I thought it was totally self indulgent and neglecting the attention the moment required. He just couldn't help but rush to a joke throughout the entire movie. Hopefully, this was his last shot at making a superhero movie. But wow, thanks for making money for the studio, eh? I give kudos to Rourke, Paltrow, Cheadle and Johannson. Paltrow's involvement was upgraded to a different level, showing her strengths just as she should have. And although they never got much of a chance to build much, Johansson and Cheadle made their presence very noticeable with hopes of more to expect in what I hope is a recoup of quality in Iron-Man 3(which would mean Favreau-less). My favorite scenes though were with Cheadle, as the denied friend and as War Machine. He was truly the best part of the movie. I hope Johansson comes back as Romanoff again, I liked her in this role. As little time she had on screen, this was one of her better roles. I think this character fits her fine.Rourke was a great villain. But I felt he was not quite as fearsome as the trailer made me believe. I was entirely engrossed with his character until he died. While his Vanko seemed truly capable of being evil, his demise was almost anti-climatic. His leaving the story made it even more of a disappointment because Rockwell's Hammer was allowed to live. BTW, I never liked Rockwell's Hammer because his character was as much of a joke as Favreua's take on this movie.Getting back to the loud explosions and bright lights, one scene near the end is the best example of why this Iron-Man is a great example for a weak superhero movie. While a large portion of the city is in flames, where is Iron-Man? Why, he is too busy talking to Pepper about her future. Dying children, women and men, ahhh, too busy here, folks. Iron-Man has a thing for this woman. Can't be bothered now. Give me a superhero who can't be bothered to help mankind and I give you nothing in return. I was hoping throughout the movie to see his ego fade away. Matter of fact, I had thought he learned a lesson near the end of the first Iron-Man. Guess I was wrong.4 out of 10 - plain and simple. Suggestion: wait til the DVD hits Redbox. And disregard the positive reviews for the movie itself, it sucked.",4,8,16,7 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," I like my Sparrow well-done but you can keep the cheese
","Happy to say I thought the movie was OK. Sad to say, I am rating on the lower end of a 7.So much repetition and too much time taken up with repetition. This is one of the few times I will say a movie was too long. But it is because of so much 'same ol', same ol''. And I am not saying it the same ol' stuff from other movies but the same ol' stuff from the first movie.Jack Sparrow is still entertaining and so is his soul, Johnny Depp. Orlando Bloom does everything right. He well deserves his own swashbuckling lead part. Keira's character is a nice ornament that I wouldn't throw out with the rum. But for the other characters, none held any intrigue for me. Don't get me wrong, they fit in but they had nothing spectacular going for them.I think the very best part of the movie was one long action scene that played out some of the best choreographed action I have ever seen. This includes the best 3-party face off since 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly'. AND this one far exceeds that face off.You should see the movie if you liked the first, but be ready for a very rocky boat ride. Too much dialogue, too little good action, too much 'filler' action, too many old faces, not enough of anything new and way too long. This movie could have been done in 90 minutes or so - and probably should have. Enjoy it, but don't expect anything except for a lot of makeup. Oh and that reminds me, there is one very interesting make-up scene but not enjoyable as it reminded of a last ditch effort to mix it up just for the sake of mixing it up(sorry, but no spoilers here).I hope the end of the trilogy comes from the heart and not the pocket book as this one obviously did.",7,2,4,7 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Chronicles of Narnia; one for the books and the movies!
","The only thing that kept me from giving this a 10/10 was acting by the 4 siblings. I thought, for the most part, they did a good job but too often I found myself squirming in my seat because they irritated me due to their lack of acting skill. They were still lovable though.Otherwise, this movie is better than Harry Potter movies when it comes to fantasy. I found the movie more pleasing and fascinating than HP - less dark and disturbing. The story itself is dark and so goes the movie, but because it was easier to follow, I was more interested and less bothered by the darkness.I loved Tilda Swinton's performance as the White Witch. She was evil and believable. While it may not happen, she deserves an Oscar.I highly recommend it for everyone who doesn't require the site of sex and/or violence to get enjoyment from a movie. Those who remember when movies had moral messages should also enjoy this movie.BTW, the CGI was fantastic! Very well done, and I do not believe I have seen a CGI lion look so real. All the other fantastic creatures looked as good as my imagination's version when I read the book as a child.Loved it and give it an 8/10",8,2,4,9 December 2005
Public Enemies," Public Enemies is a friend of mine
","The name John Dillinger sends a chill down the back of people from several generations. The memory of his fame fades faster and faster. Those directly affected by his actions probably wish they could forget. Born to people who were children during his rampages, I heard the stories of adventure and crime. While the same lips would warn of the evil, bloody acts done by that horrible demon of a man, how could I not wonder while shuddering in terror, 'What made this person do these things and why?'. To this day I still wonder. There is no better explanation than the basic 'evil'. Any movie about him and his peers before today would tell you that.Now comes Michael Mann with his version of a man gone wrong. I still have no pity for the man but I left the theater more satisfied after seeing a more complete movie about the destructive legend. Not only are bad guys bad, but we get to see good guys go bad. Johnny Depp was excellent as the self absorbed, money and power driven bank robbing murderer. His sneers from overconfidence were chilling and even funny when, in one scene he particularly shows his disregard for police by challenging their intellect, or in another, where his picture is glaring over the audience in a theater while he struggles not to look at the attendees' reactions. You just knew he wanted to see how people would react if they knew he was there. Great performance Mr Depp!Marion Cotillard, you were even better. The smoky, glassy-eyed local girl trying to hold on to her values(perhaps) gave it all up for a wicked man who should never be lucky enough to know a woman as lovely as her. She fought off the temptation for as long as she could, but that one man was able to make her feel needed in a way no other had. Marion is the kind of actress I would like to see in any love story. Her emotional performances were classic. Myrna Loy, from the really old days, appears on the really old screen and one can instantly see the comparison in skill and beauty.Christian Bale is a very intense actor. I like what he does in about everything he has done. While I have no complaint about his performance, I was caught daydreaming temporarily when his first appearance during a testimony reminded me a lot of Oliver North. Thank goodness for gangsters shooting everyone up because that's what it took to shake that image.OK, so the performances were great, but there were times I had to wonder why this movie sometimes seemed to be going downhill. I am glad I stuck around because it all paid off in the end. The slowest scenes were actually sticking in mind as the story built up to a climax that I thought made a different kind of twist. While you may think you know how it ends, just knowing the 'punch-line' is not enough.This is definitely not a fast paced movie so adrenalin junkies may need to adjust a little. It is a smart movie but not Shakespeare approved. I have to call it stylized drama suited for most ages(anyone who is allowed to play violent video games). While it is not blood gushing gore, there is plenty of violence.Great movie gets a great 8.",8,5,9,3 July 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," X-Men Origins rates right behind X-Men 1
","Count me as a fan. Wolverine/X-Men Origins is an engrossing movie. I found this to be a treat for the senses. All the emotions are tested and hope was restored in my mind's eye for the X-Men franchise which X-Men 3 had almost destroyed.Not only is superhero sensationalism satisfactory, but romance and mystery played an important part. Nothing is to be taken for granted. Deny denial if you dare.Acting was well done by everyone, well, maybe most. Characterizations were fine for the most part if you are not a die-hard X-Men fanatic. I understand why the die-hard may be disappointed but if you, the reader, are not expecting canon fare, you should enjoy the movie a lot. The action and wit were as fast and furious as anyone should hope for in comic book style. But then again, remember this is not a comicbook rendition of Wolverine's origin. You may find the beginning to be somewhat like a video snapshot of events preceding the so called present, but it was understandable and well played out. Take it as it was apparently intended - artistic stylism and not fan gratification. This is definitely one of those movies that is trying to please both the die-hard and the novice X-Men fan.There are more than a couple surprises, so again, don't give up hope. Oh, and stick around for post-credit gratification.7/10",7,2,5,1 May 2009
Orphan," Orphan: Psycho-drama and horror for family fun
","This was one of the best surprises in recent years. As horror stories go, I usually expect 'more of the same'. When seeing posters and trailers, I thought pretty much 'more of the same'. But I am glad to report, this was not 'more of the same'.The story was extremely well written with twists and turns that easily kept my attention. I'll admit there were some pretty slow moments that made me think it had peaked out early, but I was wrong. Stay with the movie as it squeezes out the last of your disbelief. Just don't believe everything you see and your reward will be the unforeseeable twist. Even if you think they can't be serious, the explanation is justified and real.I liked how the movie was done, almost seeming like 'Damien' may have had a sister (btw, she was one 'twisted sister'). At first feeling like a Brady Bunch movie gone bad, it soon became more like a docu-drama for discouraging adoption. While this movie could easily become competition for Psycho, Friday the 13th and The Omen I felt this movie was a lot smarter. I never expected the big twist. I certainly appreciated the explanation. Without the explanation, this would have been a major disappointment. Is it realistic? - I don't know. I only know I went in doubtful and came out a believer.Again I loved the writing, the camera work, the twists, the suspenseful events. And even minor disappointments fit in extremely well. I have to say, I didn't like the final moments but you will have to just take that and do with it what you will.While all the actors did very well, I think Isabelle Fuhrman had the biggest challenge and she pulled it off extremely well. She has 'disturbing' down perfectly. 8 of 10",8,5,11,24 July 2009
500 Days of Summer," 500 Days of Summer: I counted them just to stay awake
","In trying to determine how I will write this review, I decided to start off with honesty. Honesty was a big problem with this movie. One person thought honesty opened a direct line to an excuse for escape, while another relied on honesty to cement the relationship that this movie was about. And it was that cement that took this relationship to the bottom. For me, honesty means I am stuck with telling the truth about my feelings for this movie. I am terribly disappointed. In one word, B-O-R-I-N-G.I can never say anything bad about Zooey Deschanel but I hated her character, Summer Finn. At first sight she was cute but one moment later, there was a sense of danger for this charming beauty. She obviously stood out as standoffish at that point but later weakened and became deliciously accessible. It was a cycle that repeated more than a couple times in the movie. I have seen this kind of flipping before and nothing good ever came of it.I have so little to say about Tom because, well, he was indeed the whipping post he was made out to be.While there are so many positive comments about this movie, I have to admit I do not see it. To me this movie was a clinical observation on the process of love - nothing inspirational. Whatever hope you may have for either of the main characters, it is quickly made obvious that only one character deserves the benefits of hope...the whipping post. This movie did more to separate one of the hope for, need and meaning of love than to encourage the feelings of love.If you want to see a reality tainted yet soul-immersing movie that draws someone into the world where love is something that hurts and heals, see About Last Night. It's an oldie but it is what I hoped this movie would be similar to.I give this a 4 out of 10 and all points go to Zooey.",4,17,32,9 August 2009
Match Point," Match Point annoys
","This is the easiest review I'll ever write: You have to be a Woody Allen fan to like this movie! I have nothing against him but I find his movies boring. Match Point was no exception. The dialogue bored me. Without action, one has to rely on other aspects like dialogue, story, beauty, historical accuracy, fantasy, sex, tension, comedy, music, etc. It seemed Woody made the movie after a really frustrating day. I never got a single chuckle from it. The only funny thing was that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers seemed to be a clone of Woody's. There were a couple of times I could have sworn I saw images of Woody standing in Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' place. Maybe he has been delving into trick photography - you know, like subliminal messages.Well, Scarlett Johansson helped but Woody came up short - never got it straight. I gave it a 4 for each sex scene Scarlett was in, plus just the fact she was in it.No matter, there was not enough to keep me interested or appreciative.",4,1,2,28 January 2006
The Prestige," The Prestige - promises and delivers
","Before going to this movie, you may want to consider reading up on Nikola Tesla and his nearly invisible presence in the history of modern electricity. I'll explain later.Going to this movie I expected magic, love, rivalry and maybe even the supernatural. There was definitely magic, although the movie itself did not feel magical. However, that should not keep you from seeing the movie. There was love, but I did not love this movie as I was watching it. There was rivalry and plenty of it. And 'supernatural'? Well, I still struggle with that because one of the mysteries of the movie has quite an interesting but unresolved history.In my opinion most people are going to see this movie because of the excellent actors and the potential for supernatural thrills. What I fear is that most people who see this movie will not know how to relate Tesla to the 'supernatural' and magic of electricity. So, for your own good, check out Wikipedia or some other resource for information about Nikola Tesla. If you know the story of Tesla and his experiments, you will find the movie and ending even more satisfying. Remember all through the movie what the three parts of the magic trick are - the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige. Does Michael Caine only refer to the tricks the magicians perform or does he have a deeper message? Does Christopher Nolan have a deeper message? I for one, think he was very clever with the ending.Performances, twists, the ending and direction make this movie well worth the money for the viewer who wants some intelligence out of a movie that promises magic. It can be slow but it gives you time to think(I needed plenty of that).I pledge 8 of 10 canaries.",8,1,4,21 October 2006
Shutter Island," Shutter Island: A great movie on either side of the walls
","The trailer had me wondering if the movie would miss its mark. I was expecting the haunting atmosphere with a mystery to boot. I kinda wondered if there were going to be ghosts or evil creatures. But I left that in the back of my mind. I opted more for the mystery and atmosphere.Unfortunately, I expect DiCaprio to disappoint me because he just doesn't have that 'quality actor' appeal for me. I am also aware I am probably not in the majority. But as it goes, I am slowly coming out of my cloud of negativity. This was one of DiCaprio's better roles. I liked him best in The Departed but Shutter Island is going to stick in my mind for a long time.Ben Kingsley was at the top of his game here as the mysterious Dr. Cawley. He was an easy man to be suspicious of thanks to his squinty eyes and devious smirks. Thanks also to the implications and direction of the movie. While DiCaprio and Kingsley easily filled the bill for leads, all the actors did a great job of keeping this viewer's attention.The atmosphere and scenery provided satisfactory background while the action and actors merged well to make this such a great, void-less movie. Yes, the sea was angry that day my friend, but actions, icons, trinkets and memories kept the restless mind rolling. Push came to shove when doubt tried to overrule belief. 'Up' and 'down' had no meaning or relevance when it came time to analyze. What did have meaning was the love for the mystery and love itself.Once again, Scorsese puts it altogether in such a beautiful way. You sir, are the boss! And I mean that in a good way. Thanks! 9 of 10",9,5,11,19 February 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne Ultimatum outdoes itself and the others
","This in no way is a spoiler because it doesn't matter: 'You get more of the same in Bourne Ultimatum'. You get more of the same and more. Matter of fact, it is quite nearly the ultimate. Paul Greengrass has another hit with this movie - a HUGE hit! The camera sways just like a lot of people say, but in no way did that take anything away from this movie. It is fast paced, smart, painful to watch at times because of the beatings you can almost feel and, all in all, it was totally enjoyable thanks to the high energy.Watching the fight scenes, it became apparent that Greengrass has done what every Kung Fu/Karate movie should do. They lack the quality acting, script, plot and even fighting.Damon plays Bourne with the same intensity so it isn't like he is doing anything different. However, it is so much fun to watch him play this character. I think Bourne is a part of Damon or vice versa. Quite honestly, I think Damon plays Bourne just the way fans of this series wants him to be played. Another thing important to this movie is the character interaction. Especialluy when it comes to Julia Stiles. He and Stiles should get together again in another movie. There seems to be very good chemistry there. I think they could be another historical Hollywood couple.I loved the movie and am giving it an 8 of 10. You can bet I will be there for Bourne #4.*fingers crossed*",8,0,2,3 August 2007
Watchmen," Watchmen: another so - so reality show
","Right up front, the fact is, this movie was just interesting. The story seems to imply that superheroes are just people too. My reaction is 'so? superheroes aren't real.' I can go to any movie knowing that any person is just a person. Am I supposed to be drawn to these superheroes because they are people? Am I supposed to suffer with them because they acted like people? Not every person is the same and not every superhero is the same. So? Can we get to something substantial please? Guess what? We do. We find out that superheroes are like people when things are good AND when things are bad!. Wow. Another lesson in life - redux.The special effects were simply OK. I challenge critics of special effects in other superhero movies to give this a higher grade. Dr Manhattan and his 'fortress' were cartoonish to a fault and should have been given more attention.While some of the action was enjoyable, it usually felt gratuitous and simply distraction from the slow moving pace. I can say I did not go to this movie for action but some more would have been nice. At one point, I was even imagining Rorschach fighting Batman - that would have been fun.Rorschach(Jackie Earle Haley) and Nite Owl II(Patrick Wilson) were the most interesting characters and yet were both still underused in my opinion. Malin Akerman was enjoyable as Silk Spectre II, well, because I am a person and I have person desires. While Mr Comedy has the most action, I enjoyed the action the other three provided much more.I did enjoy the story somewhat for having a different take on what it can mean to be a superhero and some of the characterizations were noteworthy. For the most part, though, it felt too preachy partly because of the extensive narration. Although, in a weird way, because the narration was done by Rorschach it did lend some sincerity to the story as it is Rorschach who really is the bonding agent in the movie.I know this is a confusing review but the movie itself was somewhat confusing and frustrating because it was only 'just interesting'. It gets 6/10",6,3,7,6 March 2009
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Being a virgin really is something to laugh at
","You can't help but think that this movie is somehow going to fail. Once it starts, you hope you are wrong. Thanks to the fertility gods this movie was hilarious. There is something very special about Steve Carell. His subtle approach makes practically everything he does or say worth paying attention to. Even the scene where he (this harmless, naive 40 year old going through his first childhood still) verbally abuses an innocent woman is hilarious even though all the while you can still feel sorry for the poor lady. But heck, even she is laughing. They must have forgot to tell her to act. The only bad part is not worth mentioning except I don't want to leave the impression this movie is perfect. It is too long by about 20 to 30 minutes because it does have that slow part in the middle and towards the end that just about all comedies have for some reason. All in all, this is as perfect as any comedy can get. I feel if Wedding Crashers had made the Vince Vaughn part for Owen Wilson and given Wilson's part to Steve Carell, I would even have enjoyed it.",8,1,2,27 August 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Men Who Stare At Goats: for people who stare blankly at the big screen
","A great trailer to laugh at is a good way to sucker, I mean DRAW, people to a movie. Or maybe someone was controlling my brain(I refuse to take total blame) and made me want to see a movie about goats being killed by a superior mind. But then the title of the movie itself was so enticing. I could have spent hours trying to decipher the meaning of the title, 'Men Who Stare At Goats'. But after the disappointment with this movie, I am glad I only purchased a matinÃ©e ticket and wasted only 93 minutes.Dry humor helped me appreciate the desert environment. Boring dialogue helped me keep my eyes on the sky for alien life. Drug trips, dealing with indifference, and underused talent just sent this thing all over the place for no reason at all.My God!!! Clooney, McGregor, Spacey and Bridges...what happened??? I saw Robert Patrick too. Yep, he was there. This is not me saying I don't care for these guys, because I do. But someone did not know how to use the talent made available. Someone didn't know how to connect the dots.The story was inspired by what? - a true story??? So what? The silliness in the movie was just that, SILLY. So, silliness was inspired by some silliness? Really?? WOW. Someimes I hate going to movies.There is an Oasis in the movie but when you find it in the credits alone, there is nothing to give credit to. The trailer is indeed the funniest part of the movie.Miss it, please. 4/10",4,12,34,6 November 2009
Jarhead," The Mother of all war movies
","The movie started too soon. I was still in awe of the King Kong trailer! MY GOD, it was GREAT! So anyway, the movie started while I was overwhelmed by the Kong trailer. I was already thinking 'this sucks', before the first minute was up. But I thought to myself, 'hey, this isn't fair! I need to give it more time.' Welcome to the suck. What a roller coaster ride! What a welcome to reality - a reality most do not see. The movie most definitely sucks all your emotions from your soul at one point or another. Before this movie is over, you have sucked in as much as you can handle. Every breath you drew sucked in fresh air from stale history.Check your political views at the door. There is no need for that extra baggage. You will be subjected to insight you more than likely never had before. You thought war was ugly? Hey! You win a prize, congratulations! The thing is, you don't know what ugly is unless you have been up close. When you see this movie, you will be sucked into all that is ugly. Despite its ugliness, this movie is beautifully done. Art covers a broad area and this movie covers it all.After the first moments of the movie, it is easy to laugh because it is safe to laugh. After a certain point in the movie, when you know things are going to get serious, you are tempted to laugh(I am sure the movie makers tempt you, daring you to laugh) but you will probably hold it back because you can't see yourself being a part of the dirty jokes and wicked tricks on-screen. Subject yourself to the training and torture that these men have to endure and you may begin to see the humor. But in the meantime, thank God you do not have to go through this. Thank those who did this for you. Welcome to the suck.If you go (or went) for big war battles, disappointment will be your friend. Lucky you! But there is no disappointment for the movie fan who gets a taste of reality from a padded seat while crunching on popcorn and slurping a tasty softdrink while taking in reality from afar. Yes, it is reality and it is well done by everyone. The creators and the actors all were great. It is my understanding that Jake Gyllenhaal broke a tooth when he jammed a gun into his mouth because he was so wrapped up in the moment. That moment in the movie was one of the best performances I ever saw. But even that moment is not so special compared to the performances everyone else gave. When you can remember these people are actors, you then realize, how great they were.This movie DID NOT SUCK! It doesn't deserve a 10 because I personally cannot give war movies a 10, but I came close. I give it 8 out of 10 sausages.",8,3,7,4 November 2005
District 9," District 9: Hug an alien today
","A science fiction movie that makes one relate more to the aliens which remain mysterious from beginning to end, still should have explained why the aliens were on Earth in the first place. Not knowing that bugs the heck out of me. But in the end, as it was in the beginning, my attention was never lost.My admiration for this movie is unexplainable to say the least. I can truthfully say that this movie has the realism that sci-fi often understandably lacks. A spaceship from outer space? Yeah, its there! Why? Who knows? We just accept it because the real story is going on all around it and us. We get to see the documentary build its tale of 'truth', which is one dimensional because the truth is only what we humans know. When one of ours is forced into a life never expected and inconceivable to everyone(including aliens), we then become involved by trying to relate to what we do not understand and understand what we cannot deny.The action is not a big part of this movie because this movie has too much going on for any one aspect to get all of the attention. But what action there is, will keep you engrossed and distract you from reason as I am sure it was intended. But, action or not, I was seat-bound in hope for resolution. Watching one man trying to remain a part of his heritage but forced to accept an unforeseen destiny was, for me, the biggest part of this movie.These aliens did not seem so foreign to me which is why I loved their look and the way they moved. I think the creators of this movie did a great job of making them '?loveable?'.There is nothing wrong with this movie that I can think of other than the one point I made earlier - I don't know why they were here. Maybe that will come up in the prequel or sequel if there is one or the other.I gave it a 9 because it deserved more than an 8 and because a 10 would be pointless without a certain explanation. I really hope to see a continuance.",9,8,15,14 August 2009
Batman Begins," This Batman is the first real Batman movie
","It is hard to even consider that any of the previous Batman versions are nearly as good. First of all, this Batman really does draw you into the city of Gotham and gives a feel for why it needs to be saved. When Bruce Wayne says he wants to save it, you believe! You actually follow along because you are now a part of this movie once you have joined Batman in his need for justice. This movie rocks for its high energy, clever writing, and its ability to draw you in to the city of Gotham and Batman's world of dark, vigilante style of justice. I feel good about feeling bad! YES!! Please, though, no more Katie Holmes. She is a negative because of her lack of style. And the few one-liners often fail. But I still give it a 9 out of 10.",9,1,2,17 June 2005
2012," 2012: Mayans knew 2012 would be the disaster film to end all disaster films
","Once I saw the first trailer, I knew the movie was going to be exactly what the trailer told us it would be. One disaster after another with people dying and certain people just escaping death by a hair. If you really expect to see a mystery then forget it. On second thought, go anyway, this movie is fun for fun's sake.I can't even remember if the Mayans were mentioned, but they may have been. There! There's your Mayan fix. The Mayans were mentioned. Now sit back and enjoy the long wild ride.A spectacular film, the lucky ones only have to keep running and dodging. You have to hold your breath longer than is humanly possible while the actors do all the work. Images of concrete and glass flying all around while intense audio nearly blasts you out of your seat and grabs your attention and shakes it til your bones rattle. Family tragedies are used as a buffer to slow things down a bit but not for long. 2012 is one excellent fun film. But it is not for fans of great acting.I have no problem with any of the acting because even though none were great, none of them distracted from the movie. 2012 is like but better than other tragedy films in a big way. Compare it to Poseidon, Day After Tomorrow, Deep Impact if you want, but none come close to being as fun and spectacular as 2012.A free from thought movie, I give it an 8",8,1,7,13 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Men, Y me?
","It is not my intention to offend X-Men fans who liked this movie. But this movie should be the 'X'-it sign for the producers if they have any self respect. In my opinion they had no respect for the X-Men fan, but they may have tricked many into believing they did. Throughout much, if not most, of the movie I could not help thinking this movie was styled from bad B-movies from the 50s. I almost half expected The Blob to enter into it or the Swamp Thing even. Why? Continuity and dialogue. It...was...so...stiff...and...weak. The actors didn't have a chance to act. The scenes were too short and fast. AND OMG! The score was so damn awful. Who said it was a good idea to overplay the horns and percussion for even the slowest and least dramatic moments?Back to the actors. They did what they could but what they really needed was that guy from the last airing of American Idol who thought he was another Clay Aiken! LOL, This movie sucked so bad. I don't even want to get into what should have been involved, dramatic twists. Instead, it was as if someone said, 'Hey let's have a twist here!' and then dropped it like a hot potato.Go away Rattner! You bother me. Someone please get that Singer guy, PLEASE!I gave it a 2 out of 10 Because I liked the 2 previous movies so much and I figure they deserve at least one point for the heck of it. Make sense? - more than this movie!",2,1,2,26 May 2006
Stardust," Stardust escapes the galactic vacuum
","This movie would have worked so much better if they had left out the 21st century dialogue and mindset. The 21st century is great for special effects which was almost excellent. But when a movie takes place in another period, please leave out lines like 'This is the part where you tell me...'. De Niro can say that all he wants when he plays a cop or bad guy, but why waste great acting on really bad dialogue? Unfortunately, the writing often seemed cheap and non-relevant.What saved the movie was good special effects and the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer, De Niro and Claire Danes along with some very good performances by side-kicks and lesser-knowns.Throughout much of the movie, you have to accept 'changes in the rules' like it were some game that was played by rules which could be changed at anytime(especially at the end). It's like watching a Superman movie where you know what powers he has and you wonder what he will do to get out of a mess. In this movie, disaster can be avoided by simply having a writer toss in a 'Scooby-Doo' type explanation to appease the audience rather than enveloping the audience in beauty, awe and mystery. In this case, when beauty and mystery made itself obvious, writing all too often drew the viewer away from its comfort zone by tossing it into a kiddy carnival atmosphere.I accepted the fact that the writing was not geared to the more mature audience. I also accepted the fact that the movie was not quite what it could have been. I think it is safe to compare this movie to Haunted Mansion. It started out good but cheap comedy changed a good story into something that didn't have a ghost of a chance at being a huge hit.I gave it a 7 out of 10 because most of the time, I had hope it might get better. Just don't hold your breath thinking the same.",7,4,8,10 August 2007
The Illusionist," The Illusionist upstages the doubters
","What a surprise I got from The Illusionist! When I saw the first trailer I wanted to see this movie. Then I heard various negative reviews that gave me the impression this may not be one I want to see. I am so glad I ignored those reviews.I found The Illusionist to be magical.This is a story of 'young love rekindled' like no other I have seen before. While the young girl grows up to be a beautiful young lady who enjoys special privileges, she obviously is not happy. The boy grows up to be a young man with a special talent which amazes people where-ever he goes and threatens those who it have it all and think they deserve it.Pity those who do not understand this power or the magical love planted in the hearts of young ones trapped in unforetold destiny.Along with the usual attractions, The Illusionist accomplishes something few movies do - all the characters were extremely interesting. This was not about just one or two people. Everyone had a part and all the performers played their characters with love! I found myself actually paying attention to everyone in this movie just like we pay attention to a magician who is about to attempt tricking his audience.You may have noticed I rated this a 7. There are problems and that's why I didn't rate it higher. The Illusionist needed a better score. while it was pleasing for the most part, it seemed out of synch during some important parts of the movie. I think narration was very good and probably should have replaced certain parts of the score. Along with the score one other flaw did not escape my attention - the fast paced ending. It is unfortunate these two flaws existed but still, the acting, narration, story and cinematography excelled.",7,0,2,1 September 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Silver Surfer Surfs to Stardom while the Fantastic 4 Flounders
","Initially, I was going to wait for a week so sincere reviewers would get a chance to write this one up. I became so tired of the fake reviews which were written with ulterior motives. But, I caved in, anxious to see the new, improved version of The Fantastic Four. I came out 'not impressed' but grateful it was not as bad as the first.First, the good stuff: the characters individually and independently were better, Silver surfer was a very good character, the special FX were better, the action and movie as a whole was definitely geared towards satisfying the young and family oriented movie goers, and the humor was sometimes better.I still do not get anything out of the relationships for the most part. It feels like there is just no connection between the characters. Reed and Sue getting married? Why? They are no more in love with each other than The Thing and Human Torch. Adding to this bland relationship tragedy is the horrible dialogue which is just as bland. Dialogues come across more like announcements than engaging conversation. While I managed a couple chuckles, the humor seemed forced and cheap. I found nothing funny in scenes where devastation surrounds mankind but time is taken for the F4 to ignore the crowd around them while they make a wisecrack or two. Superhero action seemed to be inserted as an after thought sometimes. Why does it seem there is always a crowd around when you don't need one?Not only was camera work stiff, it was almost like flashing snapshots on the screen a lot of the time. And why do they always have to stop to have a discussion while fighting evil. Is Tim Story telling us that his viewers are too stupid to follow a conversation on the move? Believe me, I got bored watching action stalled out for the sake of one-liners.Speaking of one-liners, here's one for you, the background music seldom matched what was on-screen. And I am sure the gun fire sounding like muffled firecrackers was not a problem at the theater. I do not know if it is Story's fault or 20th Century Fox's that this movie still does not make The Fantastic Four as fantastic as they deserve to be. I only know that because one failed, they both failed. Both should remove themselves from Superhero movie-making.Like I said, I was not impressed but thankful it was slightly better. I struggled to give it a 5 out of 10. No thanks to Doom who did nothing much at all.",5,4,9,15 June 2007
Transformers," Bay transforms high expectations to total disappointment
","I am surely in the minority but I can't help it. This was a disappointment for me. But I am not surprised...thanks for nothing to Bay. The idea of the Transformers was good enough. The first part of the movie was good enough. I actually started to like the movie because the introduction to the characters was very well done and the Transformers looked believable. But during the action back in the US of A, it lost its way. The interaction between the characters was so unbelievable. Sure the story is a fantasy, but when you have such a fantasy as this one could have been, making the characters act like idiots doesn't help the movie. Of course Bay had to exaggerate everything. I am not sure why he has to push everything over the edge, and I do mean everything! Go if you loved the Transformers as a child, you can still feel like a kid at this movie. Just don't expect lasting quality beyond the appearances of the bots.",5,4,10,8 July 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Pride and Prejudice is perfection to say the least
","I cannot believe I almost passed on Pride and Prejudice. I wanted to see it all along, but I chose other movies instead. This week, the only thing that was new and nearly enticing was the Kid and I. I chose the better of the two.Pride and Prejudice was without a doubt the best romantic period piece I have ever seen. I tried Vanity Fair and Girl With a Pearl Earring and others in the past but none were as delightful. The others were so stiff and stodgy by comparison. They usually are aren't they? P&P was so beautiful and lively.Every performer was perfect. Nearly every camera shot was a work of art. Even one of those 'line dances' was so artful and absorbing, I nearly didn't notice in one scene that the ballroom was subliminally emptied to imply Elizabeth and Mr Darcy were so drawn to each other that they didn't feel anyone else's presence. When I finally caught on, I thought, 'DAMN good camera work and direction!! DAMN good acting!!'.Donald Sutherland was given a chance to show his best stuff ever! He is a great actor but now he has proved he is a GREAT actor! Judi Dench was great as well. Of all the characters, hers was the most distinguishable due to the wickedness and cold-heartedness of her character. She was someone you could easily despise and pity at the same time. Keira Knightley and Rosamund Pike...WOW!!!! I had no idea Keira was such a fantastic actress. Sure we all know she is a beautiful woman, but what a wonderful performance she gave. Rosamund was equally as attractive and will be on my list of talented beauties to watch.All of the performers were so talented and easy to watch, I had no time to let my mind wander as it often does. But it is not all due to the acting of course. Joe Wright was THE right director for the job and Deborah Moggach succeeded with a succulent screenplay. Thanks to everyone involved for making this move as beautiful as it is.I have a widely varied taste when it comes to music and movies so I can attend most any style and remain objective and I encourage those with equally varied tastes to see this splendid, heart warming movie without hesitation. True, if you do not want to see this type of romance, you may be best off not seeing it. But you never know what may change your mind and your taste. This one may just be the one to make that change. I give it a 10/10 and I do not feel that is sufficient.",10,5,8,2 December 2005
Alice in Wonderland," Alice In Wonderland: Take it or leave it, sadly
","Prior to the movie, I was still holding onto hope. I had read the complaints about Alice In Wonderland. After the movie all I can add is confusion. This is what happens when you feel disdain and admiration. Thankfully the feelings are separated distinctly To cover my butt, I am starting off with what some may consider spoilers. You decide.***** POSSIBLE SPOILERS***** 3D or not 3D: I opted for the 3D version. What I feared from 3D is that the special attention to 3D might interfere with the attention to story and acting. THat indeed happened. While, for the most part, 3D was done well, so many times, the intricacies which should dazzle were too flittery and fast and sometimes fuzzy so it was not used to the best of its ability. But the staples were used in terrific fashion. Depth, color, stationary backgrounds, and normal motion fit well into the 3D scheme of things, however. So I am guessing that the non-3D version may have a definite advantage over 3D. Given all that, I am sure if you have half a notion, you will still want to see it in 3D if possible. So go, but be forewarned.Acting: Depp and Carter were beautiful. Mia Wasikowska played an excellent Alice but I think her character was so distorted by Burton's darker desires that it will soon be forgotten who did play Alice. On the other hand, Depp and Carter were so absurd and colorful as Mad Hatter and Red Queen they immediately drew my respect and admiration. However, the Red Queen was the only one of those two characters that I felt remained most closely relevant while Mad Hatter often reminded me of Depp's flaky Jack Sparrow thanks to unforeseen feistiness in some scenes. That takes me back to why I was not too happy with Alice - didn't like the warrior in armor scene at all. As for Glover and Hathaway, neither offered much talent. Hathaway's quirkiness as the White Queen was just too unappealing.Story: I so wish the story was the original Alice and not a sequel of sorts. While it was definitely Burton's story it was not a great story at all. Again, making Alice a warrior was not what I, personally, wanted to see. Characters seemed too self absorbed. Fast paced humor came and went but only would have worked well if there was enough time to feel some endearment to the character.Overall: Right down the middle because things felt way too fragmented. I will say that I am thankful that the job of bringing book-true Alice In Wonderland was not given to Burton but I hope we get a version that looks as good artistically as this one did and then some.5 out of 10",5,6,14,5 March 2010
Avatar," Avatar: The parts that miss are good enough and offer hope for more
","Avatar, Avatar twinkling from afar. I wish I may, I wish I might review your wonder near as bright.UPDATE: AFTER SEEING THIS AT A DIFFERENT THEATER, I WANT TO ADD THAT 3D EFFECTS WERE BETTER, AS WAS AUDIO, BUT IMPROVEMENTS ARE STILL NEEDED TO MAKE 3D A RELIABLE ACROSS THE BOARD STANDARD. BUT STILL AN EXCELLENT MOVIE.This is not a negative review, so everyone can breathe free now. I liked the movie as it was done, Unfortunately, for those of us who can be overly analytical, I really think some things needed to be done to make it a better appreciated 3D movie. Perhaps I should say that I have my doubts about the capability of the theater I was at even though it is one of the newer ones. As a result, I have to see the movie again at another theater.****SPOILERS HERE**** The 3D effects were good but with obvious fault. The less important, tiny features stood out better than the more important, screen filling creatures. Colorful plants were cute and charming, knives and arrows pointed at the screen seemed almost real and disarming. Flying and falling, which I thought would thrill, were flat, giving me little more than a chill. Running through the jungle was exhausting to say the least, dodging bushes, branches, huge trees and wild beasts.Seriously, after all the hype and high expectations I did find some things that needed more attention. For a true 3D movie, I wanted 3D sound as well. The beasts and huge machines that should have made the ground tremble and send sounds of thunder were not as impressive as they could have been. It seemed that more attention was given to vision than to the audio and it was way too noticeable. Again, I will be seeing Avatar at another theater which may correct that problem. However, I am not able to see Avatar at IMAX, so that's out.While the Na'vi were well done, I didn't see the advantage to watching in 3D as opposed to seeing it in digital. I could have been happier seeing it in digital because I would have been less critical of the faults of 3D. Not that I disliked the effort, because I think Cameron did a great job - much better than most other directors probably would have done. But he could have used something that J. J. Abrams used, flaring or glaring flashes of light that gave screen images the appearance of being lively. Abrams may have used it a little too much in Star Trek, but it worked very well. It's just that bright lights in Avatar were not as bright or real as they could have been.While the story was good, it was a little much to see military and corporate people in the year 2154 being so cruel and soulless as some appeared. I do not believe we can be such idiots so far into the future. The Na'vi were much more appealing and spiritual. Their desire to work with nature gave them a definite advantage in the 'smarts' department. I was wondering why no one gave Enya a vocal part during rituals at the tree of souls. She would have fit beautifully. Yeah, that's right, I like Enya. And yeah, that's right, I am saying this is somewhat of a chick flick with heart and soul. At least Avatar has huge battles and Tarzan-like scenes with wild animals doing harm to man-kind. And there were wild animals that were tamed and loved. So there was definite balance.So, to finish, I say see Avatar. It is a very good movie and 3D effects were very good but they also missed the mark when it came to getting the full affect from visual and audio immersion. That's not a complaint, just an observation. I hope Cameron continues in this effort to perfect 3D because I think he can do it after learning from his mistakes.Even after all the things I did not like, my love for the movie as a whole I am glad to give this a 9/10",9,2,6,18 December 2009
Invincible," Invincible - well, not quite. Reality outscores interest.
","I know nothing about the book written by Vince Papale other than what I believe to be true after seeing the movie. The movie appeared to be factual and thats why this movie was less than great. So much time was put into making Invincible look real that spectacle, glamor and intrigue seemed to be mostly overlooked.I can relate somewhat to the movie as Papale tried to overcome hard times while just trying to stay alive - without hope for any future. Opportunity made the difference for Papale and intense desire carried him to a great future. Even if I had the opportunity, I do not know if I could have ever been one to stick with the goal he had made for himself. So, being able to relate; being able to understand his place in life, you might think I would say I loved this movie. I wanted to but I came away slightly disappointed. I didn't see any spectacle, glamor and intrigue.He got what he wanted and the movie was over, or so it seemed.I was OK with the acting - nothing really spectacular there. The story dragged for so long that it was easy to get ahead of myself. I don't think replaying relationships needed to be done so often. No wonder instant replays are limited in the NFL, they really DO slow things down.I apologize to fans of 1970's music, but damn, they could have used a lot less in the movie. I understand they wanted the movie to look real but overusing the music cheapened the affect of the movie.No matter, the movie was good enough to see and good enough for a couple chuckles and a few tears. Add this to the list of good sports movies but do not expect it to get inducted into the Hall of Fame.Greg Kinnear was an excellent Coach Vermeil(Vermeil is my all-time favorite coach). Mahlberg scored with his performance as well. Elizabeth Banks just gets better and better but can still be even better - and I am sure she will.I gave this movie a 7 of 10. The overall story was good, though they could have played it out much better. If the objective was to get people into the theater, they accomplished their goal but it didn't win the game. They needed to try harder. It will make a lot of people glad they saw the movie but will not make the masses stand up and cheer. It just doesn't have that heart-warming that most great sports movies have.",7,1,4,25 August 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," HP was good but I shoulda seen Walk the Line
","First, I never read any of the books and I was not happy with the other 3 movies. I agree this was the best of the 4. But as it was with the other movies, I went because everyone claimed this is such a good story and each movie following was supposed to be darker and better. I know I am going to be in the minority but I am not impressed with the movie. It was indeed darker but not much else was different.The movie had some charming characters; had some charming moments; had plenty of good CGI; had some beautiful scenery; and I felt I had been had again.I am not sure what it is, but I do not get the thrill out of Harry Potter that so many others do. I tried to figure it out and all I can come up with is it seems to be contrived. It is entirely possible the dialogue never seemed real. Matter of fact, the CGI seemed more realistic than the dialogue. With that said, the CGI may also be part of the problem for me. It is not that I do not like CGI. I love so many movies in which CGI is used, but none of them use it so much. On the other hand, I loved every Lord of the Rings movie and that makes it harder to explain my feelings. So I guess I have to say that the combination of things must just rub me the wrong way.I give it a 7(I gave LOTR a 10) because the story was good, the special effects were good, the effort was good, and the fans are good. Soooo, the movie was good but I wish it could have been better.",7,0,2,21 November 2005
The Happening," The Happening never happened
","How is it that a man, who has so many fans, can so blatantly insult everyone's intelligence and hope to get away with it? I never made an attempt to become a fan of Shyamalan's and now I never will. The only thing I saw of his that I liked was Sixth Sense. It was fun and interesting even though I remember figuring it out before it was half over. I could explain why I failed to like The Village and Lady In the Water but I don't want to bore anyone, including myself. Although I can tell you why I was excited by Lady In the Water. Simply, the first trailer with Josh Groban singing beautifully and the look of a dark, wonderful fairy tale sucked me in only to lead me to a futile, fatal attraction.For me, seeing The Happening was a weak moment and an effort to forgive.I cannot blame poor acting because I think the actors all did as they were told. What some may blame on poor acting was instead, in my opinion, a matter of poor, deceitful directing, leading the performers into a belief that they were a part of a great film which would deliver with fantastic editing - and their shallow characters would fit into a grand plan of the great master's philosophy and plan. I feel sorry for all the performers whom I really do admire. It is because of one man's self servitude and shallow vision that many others may suffer. Hopefully I am wrong.This is not a movie. I went to see a movie and all I got was this stupid philosophy lesson. I get my lessons from life Shammy and I get my kicks from movies. When you decide to get back into the entertainment business, you're going to have to fight real hard to get me into the theater.The Sham-fan will get their fill but I will not understand why. But the movie fan will find that there is no artistic value to this sham of a flick. In my mind, the reason for this film was lost in the wind. This makes it easier to believe that he gives himself far too much credit for artistic value, which, in fact, in my opinion, has indeed been blown away by the winds which we all know affect us if we let them remove from reach the real reason why we are here.1/10 if not 0/10",1,4,10,13 June 2008
Zombieland," Zombieland: More of Woody kicking butt would have saved it
","I never go to a Zombie movie unless it looks like it contains some quality. What hooked me on Zombieland was the opportunity to see Woody Harrelson doing some butt kicking in a light hearted way. I liked him best when he tried to be funny. I felt sorry for him in earlier disastrous movies. I avoided him until I saw the trailer for Zombieland. Seeing him dressed up to kill Zombies really got my hopes up. So I went to see Zombieland.Woody was the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, the movie didn't know how to use his character. Just from the trailers alone, I felt this was going to be great fun watching dead walking people get even deader. Woody shooting the walking dead...Woody hacking the walking dead...Woody smashing the walking dead - what more could one want? Seeing him do this sort of thing in more serious roles with non-dead people just didn't do it for me. I saw the trailer and felt, the guy's humor is back and he is going to have fun. I am glad he had the role of Tallahassee but apparently the geniuses behind this movie thought Eisenbergs character would win us over. WRONG!!! Eisenberg has a definite cute factor but he is always wimpy. He should never be a main character. How anyone saw it best to let his character override Harrelson's is beyond me. I will admit that the beginning of the movie had me feeling optimistic. Starting out as though some early teenage kid had just written this Zombie movie in his bedroom in a few hours, the narration had me smiling from ear to ear and laughing out loud. It had a great feeling in the beginning. But then the long (I mean l-o-o-o-n-g) musical introduction kicked in and began to drag everything down. That is until Woody made his first appearance. I was once again hopeful. Sadly, as his character was moved from front and center to off center stage, the movie became less and less funny.Bill Murray's short appearance helped break monotony. But, to heck with that, let's get back to the wimp and see if he can get some sympathy from Emma Stone. YAWN. Eisenberg translates to 'boring; must avoid future possible funny films with him'.I will be fair, though. A younger generation may appreciate this movie for its abused zombies if they couldn't care less that this felt very much like an extended, bad Saturday Night Live skit. You have to go in knowing this is a comedy involving stupidity and flesh eating zombies. For that alone, it gets a 7 but denying Woody a better developed and more completely used character earns the movie a 5.",5,8,14,2 October 2009
The Departed," The Departed - Professor Scorsese teaches us all a lesson
","If you think this is the usual blood and guts gangster movie, you will be wrong. But I do not think you will be disappointed. There is so much more to this movie as long as you can put up with fiendishly clever and excessive, blood, guts, swearing and downright beautiful acting, writing, direction, camera work in an incomparable style that will be hard to beat at the next Oscar awards.It's easy to say that the people going to this movie want to see at least one of the numerous famous actors. By far the best was Nicholson, but for the rest, everyone very nearly as great, they were nose to nose at the finish line. I want you to know that I have not been a big fan of the grown but still young brat pack, Dicaprio, Wahlberg and Damon, but I am now a believer and no one twisted my arm. Seriously, everyone in this movie performed extremely well. If you have something against 'blood and guts' movies and decide not to go, the choice you make will deprive you of the best group performance I have seen in a long time. The acting is very stylistic and sometimes comically over-the-top. The writing and camera work will almost make the normal mystery buff drool for more.And now, for the master himself, Martin Scorsese. Bravo! The way you manipulated the characters, drained the Red Cross of every last drop of their reserve and yet managed to make the story so easy to follow despite its surprises was sheer genius. On top of that, this was an extremely fun movie to try to figure out. When I knew there was going to be a twist, I was surprised each time how you tricked me. I suspect Jack has taken you to the dark side. Good move! Great movie!!I do not give bloody movies a 10, so giving it an 8 of 10, you can see how nearly perfect this movie was.",8,2,5,6 October 2006
Glory Road," Glory Road shoots a long 3
","I went thinking I was going to see a basketball movie with an inspirational message - you know, like Hoosiers or Miracle or Rudy. I left with a bucket of tears and a smile in my heart.Once again a trailer failed to show the strengths of a movie. Basketball was played. Strategy was laid out. Love was shown. Sometimes people smiled. More than that, evil, hatred and ugliness destroyed lives and hope. But, above all, determination is the victor. Thats the way it was in the movie and that's the way it was during that time in our world's history. It seemed that the movie could have gone a little further to condemn the racism and hatred during the mid 60's but I think the intent in this movie is to show how love and determination were more important than fear and hate.See this movie for any number of reasons but do not expect to see a perfect movie with spellbinding performances. The message is everything in this movie and my message is, 'Go see it'!",8,4,15,13 January 2006
30 Days of Night," 30 Days of Night makes a journey through hell a joyful fright
","When you have to ask yourself if you want to see a Vampire movie, you know there is a good chance you may not want to. But you, that particular person, should watch the trailer. Watch that scene of the vampire on the top of the SUV. Notice the style with which that scene is shot. Doesn't it give you a feeling of nostalgia in a way? Perhaps that scene gives you memories of 'vampire movies when vampires seemed real'. Memories of what was scary was the vampire itself and not just what it does. I am here to tell you that is the case with this movie.I was caught up in trying to understand this vampire movie from the start. In the opening, the one lonely man trekking across the snow covered tundra - is he villain or victim? And what was it behind him as well as ahead of him? How do puny humans defeat creatures that feed on fear and blood when they have so little to give them help or hope? It's a story in a nearly barren snow covered village that empties out once a year because it is that time when everyone knows they will not see the light of day for 30 days. A few remain, willingly or not. Some will see the light of day and some will not, nor should they.This is not just one that offers you blood by the case. You get that and talent that doesn't go to waste. The talent is in the writing, cinematography, direction, makeup and performances. These vampires were going to take care of business and had no time for fancy kung-fu or flashy dialogue. They wanted blood, they smelled blood and they took blood.While there were slow periods which gave me time to think to myself, 'Hmm, that's Josh Hartnett' and a couple lines that made me wonder, 'Hey, where is Josh Hartnett', I left the movie thinking, 'Hey, that was Josh Hartnett and he was great!'. But you will give credit to all the actors in this movie. I loved watching Melissa George, Mark Boone(Flass from Batman Begins), Ben Foster(Charlie Prince in 3:10 to Yuma) and all the very creepy vampires who reminded me why vampires scared me when I was a kid. An especially creepy vampire was Danny Huston who played the head vampire, Marlow. Danny Huston, in my opinion, gives Bela Lugosi a run for his blood money.Thank you director David Slade(whose Hard Candy I will have to see now) and Writer Stuart Beattie(Pirates of the Caribbean).8 of 10",8,17,32,20 October 2007
Wedding Crashers," Hindenburg All Over Again
","Wedding Crashers,eh? Why couldn't it have been Wedding Crasher? If Owen Wilson had been the lone Wedding Crasher, I believe this movie would have had a better chance. Maybe he doesn't think he is funny. Is that why he went along with this two man idea? Personally, I think he can be hilarious. It's too bad there was this 'funny-man wanna-be' talking over him all the time. The only times I wanted to laugh out loud were squashed by the obnoxiously unfunny Vaughn. Wilson has such a great on-screen presence, why would any writer, director, producer, or co-star think otherwise? Maybe they think like me and know that Vaughn makes everyone around him look talented, afterall. I dunno. Such a waste! Owen Wilson, Rachel Mcadams, Christopher Walken and Isla Fisher all deserve kudos for their efforts. Wilson and Mcadams had a great chemistry that should have been given more time to develop but too much time was given to a previously mentioned individual who shall no longer be mentioned. Isla Fisher was hilarious. She performed extremely well. The story also deserved credit. It was a great idea that crashed and burned beyond recognition. Ohhh, the humanity!!",1,9,18,17 July 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Stranger Than Fiction - In a word, EXCELLENT
","I 'watched a book' today and the sounds and visuals drenched me to the point of satisfaction like no book has ever done. Yes I mean to say it just that way. I have not seen many movies any better than this one. And I have only seen one movie that kept my attention in the way 'Stranger Than Fiction' did. Coincidentally, or by design, that movie, 'Stay' was also directed by Marc Forster. As a result, I guarantee I will not miss a single Marc Forster movie no matter what diversion may attempt to block me. His direction was sheer genius. I truly believe that Forster deserves an Oscar for this movie (he really deserved it for Stay too).This may scare some people away but I hope not. Book-readers should be encouraged, though. Watching this movie was exactly like sitting down in your favorite chair in an atmosphere you choose, with a book you cannot put down. I have not read a good book in a very long time and I suppose it is mostly because I do not feel I have time to read a book. But after watching this movie, I felt like I soaked in everything just like you do with a good book. I felt like I was part of this remarkable experience and not the client in a sales job.Will Ferrell was remarkable! I have not been a great fan of his and always thought he should have stayed with Saturday Night Live. But his performance takes him out of the scatterbrain slapstick comic mold. He was so charming in this movie, I hope he can refrain from going back to silly, nonsensical, nonstop slapstick. But never fear, he was still comical when it was required and beautifully so.Maggie Gyllenhaal was seductive, beautiful and totally enchanting. As the person everyone loved she proved to be just that. She easily had the 'Meg Ryan innocent young woman with a delicious smile' appeal but was able to also exhibit the kind of power hard headed people have when they make up their minds to hate someone.Queen Latifah added her charm as a mysterious, dedicated and determined beauty who made her presence known but kept you in the dark with her performance.Dustin Hoffman provided everything that only he can. Subtlety was a total stranger to this direct, arrogant, yet totally charming and strange professor. I didn't mention funny did I? He was that, too.After all is said and done, no performance was as satisfying as Emma Thompson's. She also should be up for an Oscar nomination. The characterizations, mannerisms, timing and expressions were a professional's dream come true Â– perfect, without flaw.Zach Helm should not be left out. He wrote such a strange and certainly satisfying story that everyone helped to make a masterpiece which I will see again and again. I might even start reading again because of him.If you are a book-reader who believes movies are a waste of time or a movie goer who cannot stand to sit and read a book, do not miss this magical work of art. You will find yourself stunned.This, in all its glory, gets a perfect 10 from me!!",10,0,3,10 November 2006
Inception," Inception: The epitome of cinematic love
","Before going to Inception, I know this much about Nolan, I loved Batman Begins and Dark Knight and I didn't like Memento but I don't remember why - it may have been my state of mind, so I will rent it again to see what happened. I also knew I was excited about seeing Inception thanks to fantastic trailers and reviews.Arriving at the local, usually 'ok' Carmike theater, I was upset they put Inception on the smaller, non-digital screen. I hate you now, Carmike.Leaving Inception, I was mostly fretting over the ending, not knowing what it was that happened. I will have to get back to figuring that out later. As for the rest of the movie, I can safely say I have never seen a solid, mature movie like this. As one wonders if we leave our brains at the door or bring it ready for action, don't concern yourself. There is absolutely something for all. Where thought seemingly is abandoned and action takes over, we all know what happens when bullets fly...or do we? Because of the varying levels of involvement, you have to analyze the action and the possible consequences of it. Believe me, consequences are always in the middle of the moment.Visually, I do not see how anyone can be disappointed. I do believe the true adrenaline junkie will be disappointed, however. Despite the amount of action, Inception, to be so truly admired, requires much thought, and that's a much appreciated positive concept these days.Personally, I am so thankful there are people like Nolan out there. He convinced me that he cares about his creations. Inception is probably one of the most completely respectable movies as far as I am concerned. Nothing lacked except for one thing - the explanation for the ending. I need more time to finish my thoughts on that. Everything else was great. Acting, action, visuals, the cute musical allusion to one of the best performers in Inception, the mystery, and the perplexing concept of the story itself all come together as the key to true cinematic success.You might think I would give it a 10 but because of the stymieing end, I am going to be stubborn enough to give it a 9. Loved Inception and thanks again Mr Nolan!",9,2,7,16 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes: Taking names and dragging them through the mud
","This review may seem as schizophrenic as Downey's Sherlock. As others have noted, there are reasons to like this movie and reasons to hate it.Starting with why I hated it, this is not the Sherlock Holmes I remember. Sure the name is used but do not expect to see the quality detective story and character as done in the past. What we get instead is a distorted, cartoonish version of a great detective. The movie could have used other characters instead of Holmes and Watson. The movie would have been more appealing if it had in fact used a new pair of detectives. Ahhh, but Ritchie is going to make money thanks to the currently popular name of Robert Downey. In the meantime he gets to recreate, and even pollute the name of Holmes for the sake of opportunity, glory and money. That is even more devious than a plot from Blackwood or Moriarty. Even worse, Holmes is not a man of great confidence and intelligence. He resembles someone who is everything and yet nothing. A lonely, alcoholic, schizoid with little regard for sense and sensibility, he seems more able to succeed thanks to luck and surprisingly loyal friends. And yet he is an accomplished fighter, again with a great deal of cartoonish luck. How sad and pathetic. That being said, nothing really need be said about Watson.Now for the good. The story, imagining this is not about Holmes and Watson but some other unkowns, was pretty good. I liked the mystery and the evil Blackwood. I liked old London. I liked the fast pace in picking up clues and developing mystery. The action was good and the humor was OK. I preferred Watson over Holmes. Jude Law's interpretation of Watson was more appealing than Holmes( I even got to the point, where I didn't care much for Holmes). Well, that's it for the good.If you don't care for the traditional Sherlock Holmes, you may very well like this movie. But if you want to see the traditional Holmes and Watson get a clue and you will miss this slap in the face of tradition.2 out of 10 for destroying tradition but a 6 out of 10 for a good attempt at making a fun detective movie. That averages out to a 4, Lestrade.",4,13,28,26 December 2009
Casino Royale," Casino Royale, James Bond brings the house down
","I can only write a positive review about this movie and hope that you believe everything I say. There is not a better Bond movie in its entirety. I can say there were some parts in other Bond movies I enjoyed quite a lot, but not one single Bond movie is as good as this one. And now, I am going to offend someone. Sorry! Daniel Craig is the best damn Bond in Her Majesty's service.From the very beginning of Casino Royale, it was clear this was going to be the introduction of a new Bond and we were going to like it whether we were prepared to or not. I think even M went through that experience as well. She couldn't help herself, she had no choice but to respect this 007.Craig shoots straight and without missing. And he has a big gun. His less slick appearance and more acrobatic display keeps you watching so you don't miss anything. And believe me if you blink, you may miss a lot.This can be a very fast paced movie but does slow down occasionally for some smart dialogue. Although, when it slows down, do not blink yet! Sight gags and tight shots can be missed if you look the other way. Be sure to look for the Aston Martin. Oh yeah, can this guy order a drink or what!! Very different from other Bonds.Nothing misses in this movie. Acting, action, mystery, camera-work, comic-relief - it's all there like never before.Director Martin Campbell earns a 009 out of a possible 010. Great Work!",9,1,3,17 November 2006
Beowulf," Beowulf barks and sometimes bites beautifully
","I went to Beowulf because of the animation and Anthony Hopkins. Here's what I got: A beautiful piece of art spiced with the voice of one of the best performers in movie history.The story is a wonderful piece of lore. Too bad that masterpiece has to compete with another masterpiece, which is the CGI. So you have the classic story working against visual splendor. What a weird thing to happen. It was not bad, I gave it a 7, it was just almost irritating. I was dodging things thrown at my face and blood dripping into my eye. I lived to tell about it though, thank God.Here's the problem with the CGI. The faces often didn't stay the same. It wasn't a matter of facial expression, they just changed so it looked like more than one person had his/her own impression how the face should appear. It wasn't a major problem, it was just noticeable. BUT, one big problem with the CGI is they still cannot make a beautiful woman look like a beautiful woman. Sure they have no problem getting Hopkins' aging wrinkled skin right but they still make young women look like plastic Barbie dolls. Yes it sounds picky and probably petty but it is a fact. They will get it right one day I am sure.As far as they have come with CGI, this movie deserves credit for its historic achievement. I applaud everyone for a job well done. But I want to say, they just need to learn to stop trying to overwhelming the viewer with art so other aspects are not drowned out.See it for the CGI and you will not be disappointed.",7,2,13,16 November 2007
Munich," Munich gets you where it hurts.
","Munich is one mess of a movie. Not because it is a bad movie. Matter of fact, it is an excellent movie. A movie that assumes you know the reality because it doesn't tell you where the reality ends and where the non-reality begins. In this case, you should know that Black September really happened, but it's the cause and affect that is being dealt to the public. It's the cause and affect this movie is really about. Whether the after-effect really happened, it doesn't matter. A mess was made and someone needs to clean it up. How do we fight fire? - with fire of course. How do you clean up a mess? - make a bigger mess.That reminds me, this is a Spielberg movie that is nothing like the War of the Worlds he released earlier this year, but had the name not been used already, they could have called this one War of the Worlds, too. All the worlds - personal, political, familial, sociological, and any other you can think of - go off course and face possible annihilation. Gravity sucks you in and you can't escape. Maybe it was the black hole. No matter, you will become as engrossed in this movie. If you can forget about what you know politically or religiously, you will be ahead of the game. Forget about who is out to get who; watch what happens to those who let themselves get wrapped up in someone else's war.Eric Bana's Avner becomes so wrapped up in death, life seems impossible to accept and yet becomes so dear. Daniel Craig will impress you as well. I think I see now why he was selected to be the new Bond. Cirian Hinds does a great job, also.Why see this movie if you know about the true story? The story, the mystery and intrigue, Spielberg's best movie so far, great acting, self-realization...you name it. Just don't miss it.I give it a 9/10 thanks to all the above reasons.",9,1,4,24 December 2005
Fantastic Four," The good, the bad, the ugly and the beautiful
","They should probably change the name of the movie to 'The Good, the Bad, the Ugly and the Beautiful' for several reasons. 'The good' = Johnny Storm; they finally got the movie on the big screen; the characters were mostly OK except for Mr Fantastic; the story; for the most part, the CGI. 'The bad' = Reed Richards and Von Doom(bad as in evil for Von Doom but not that great a portrayal for either character); the director's concept of the Fantastic Four; the background music was horribly distracting and out of place in many instances; the background characters. 'The ugly' = Ben Grimm; warm fuzzies were more like nitric acid; some CGI. 'The beautiful = Jezzica Alba, BABY!; Jessica Alba, HONEY!; Jessica Alba DOLLFACE! Fantastic Four comics will always be one of my favorites but the movie will need a more appreciative director for the sequel.",4,2,4,9 July 2005
Moon," Moon: no place on earth for this movie
","Are you dying to see a movie that looks like it could have been done in your garage? Well, you have struck gold with Moon - or better yet, moon dust.With Kevin Spacey sounding like Lex Luthor doing HAL 9000 and Sam Rockwell sounding like Sam Rockwell, who could ask for more? Welllll, if you're stuck on the moon, you may be satisfied. I was not on the moon and so I stayed because it was my choice. It ended up being one of the worst decisions I ever made.I was asking more questions about the sensibility of this story than I was asking about the characters and their purposes. The movie is advertised as Mystery, Sci-Fi and Thriller. IMO, there was never any thriller; the mystery died quickly when Rockwell's presence on the moon became nonsensical; Sci-Fi was not so Sci-Fi after all, but more of a delivery of Sociological Fiction. The scenery was one dimensional which, with a better story, may have been OK as a Twilight Zone episode. And, actually, it came across as a bad Twilight Zone rip-off.Spacey and Rockwell performed fine but I found it hard to appreciate their performances because the story was so bland. The intermittent jabs at humor were lost in the Moon's atmosphere.I went because I thought it was going to involve a good science fiction story. This is not good sci-fi. This is not good entertainment 2 out of 10",2,23,61,12 July 2009
The Proposal," The Proposal: who cares if it isn't hilarious, it has a puffy white puppy
","Once again, the trailer is not quite about the movie. Matter of fact, once again, the funniest scenes are in the trailer. You probably are braced for a bad review. See!?!?! That's what foreshadowing does to one's expectations. I'll let this review do more for you than the trailer did for the movie.If you are going to the movie to see Sandra Bullock, Ryan Reynolds or Betty White, I do not think you should be disappointed in their performances. Betty White was fun to watch as was Mary Steenburgen. They all pulled off a good job for their parts. A couple of the performers pulled off a little more than you might expect from this movie, but then, they did get a PG-13, just a close shave from an R.The movie starts off as good as I expected. I got plenty of laughs from the role reversal, you know, the woman is the boss while the man is subservient. I think I read one review where it almost seemed like this could have been a Rock Hudson and Doris Day movie. It's true, that comes across rather clearly. It made for some good laughs. Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between after that observation. I found myself paying more attention to character contradictions as the movie went on(and on and on and on).Apparently, going home is not always a good idea. That's when it all changes for me. Daddy issues, family warmth (or the fear of it), weird dancing grandmas, old needless relations and multiple sociological intrusions and infractions just tore at the heart of potential for this movie that I thought was Bullock's 'welcome back'. I still love Sandra Bullock and I do not think the problem with this movie had anything to do with her. I only know that a certain director has soured my taste for anything that director may do in the future. For me, the movie came across as a brand new jig-saw puzzle with pieces missing right out of the box. And a couple scene/time-line edits were inexcusable and sloppy, dismissing the viewer's skills of observation.If you are going because the trailer leads you to believe this is hysterical humor, you will be saddened by what you see. If you go to get a few chuckles added to a smattering of character development(perhaps I should say 'distortion'), then you might enjoy this. I for one wonder why Bullock's and Reynold's parts weren't played by Whoopi Goldberg and Jack Black. The mere idea of those two playing the misdirected characters had a better chance of keeping me in tears of laughter instead of disappointment.I give it a 6 out of 10 for early laughs, Bullock, Betty White and a cuddly puffy white puppy.",6,2,8,19 June 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Law Abiding Citizen: Challenges the system and imaginations
","As justice too often goes, so go movies about justice. The law abiding citizen does not always win. But then, what does it take to win? Do we know when we have won? Some call it 'good enough' while others who feel cheated define justice their own way. Law Abiding Citizen was just that. One man's definition does not agree with the system's definition and now one man steps up to challenge the system because he can and he is mad.Gerard Butler, in my opinion, pulls off the best performance of his career. A monstrous Dracula, a misunderstood phantom and one ticked off warrior among Persians could not stand up to the anger this 21st century man used to overpower a system gone wrong. He was able to display that anger in a way I do not believe many others could have equalled.People who will like this movie will be those who feels justice has too often gone awry and needs adjusting and also those who pull for the underdog.As good as the story was and as good as performances were for the most part, the movie disappoints in the end. An exciting concept of one man fighting the system so ruthlessly met an early, anti-climax. The ending was rushed either because the end result could not be either conceived or possibly achieved.The system wins but the citizen scores to satisfaction. 7/10",7,7,14,18 October 2009
V for Vendetta," On a scale of I to V, V gets a V
","I liked this movie a lot! The creators were not afraid to go against the grain. They made a movie unafraid of the status-quo movie makers, unafraid of the critics and unafraid of the viewer. The main character, V, was as mysteriously charming and psychotic as I had hoped for. At least for the most part. It is not that the man wanted to be that way, because who knows what he might have become had he not been brutalized by a self-serving government. Don't let that description deter you from seeing this movie. The main character was not much stranger than the way this movie was delivered. This is the type of finished product that will be remembered for a long time. The offbeat introduction to the less important characters was as strange as V, himself. Comic relief is handled better in this movie than any other 'graphic novel' movie that I have seen. The story is very well done. The imagery was excellent. And you just have to love how Hugo Weaving made the mask come alive though it was nothing more than a stiff, lifeless, representation of life lost - a work of art in its own right.There was a time when I began to sense a slight bit of the British TV show 'The Prisoner' and even some British comedy but it only added to the mysterious beauty of this movie. The creators succeeded in making this movie play out like someone reading a graphic novel to you, pointing out the pictures from time to time.I found myself relating more to Natalie Portman's character than to V. And I think most people will. V is too unique and only an original personality can even begin to relate but he can easily be loved while feared simultaneously. Don't pay attention to those who fear you will see this movie and will want to become a terrorist. Also, DO NOT pay attention to those who want you to believe this is political. Politics is essential but a small part of this movie. The biggest part of the story is the personalities. People who want to turn this into a vehicle to tout their hatred for political figures are totally missing the mark. They, themselves, are the problem - not the movie. It IS a M-O-V-I-E!8 out of 10 because I loved it, would have ended it differently and because I think some parts were cut or changed to protect the innocent. I am counting on the DVD to put it all back together.",8,0,4,18 March 2006
The Island," Sci Fi, the lie and the truth
","So you want to go to a Sci Fi movie? These days, who knows what sci fi is? You want Logans Run? OK, you got it! You want Battlefield Earth? OK, you got it! There's no aliens, just a lot of people with personal interests. You're going to get a lot more than Sci Fi from this movie, though. Add some good IL' scenes with violence and a few chuckles. Yes, you get some Sci Fi, but really, you get more of the other stuff. If you are expecting thought provoking Sci Fi, forget it. But I think most Sci Fi fans can accept the rest of the movie's action and humor. At first I was cursing the change from Sci Fi to action but later I found myself enjoying the movie. Seriously, go with the flow. You'll appreciate it more if you do. The Island is there, just don't look too hard for it. Also, all the main characters were portrayed very well.",7,1,3,22 July 2005
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Talledega Nights, crashing before the race begins
","Will Ferrell has a comedic talent that can endear him to his fans. This is usually seen in reruns of Saturday Night Live when he was a star of that show. Unfortunately, there is no endearment in this movie. He was rarely funny. Sad to say he was at his funniest in 30 minute intervals. The movie was horribly slow and unappealing. What was funny was that because the movie was so dull and tedious, when a funny part arrived, I found myself in tears. Partly because there were a few hilarious scenes and partly because I was so grateful that something finally made me laugh.I went to the movie hesitantly and I was tempted to walk out about 20 minutes into the movie but I struggled and stayed. In the past, I have found myself completely disappointed with other Ferrell movies but I refuse to believe he is going to be so unfunny. I want to say he should have stayed in TV doing skits but thats unrealistic. What he really needs to do is find a movie that will allow him to be his old endearing self instead of the pitiful characters he seems to do quite a lot of. Hopefully, his next movie can remove that 'jerk' from his portrayals.Not a single one of the characters was funny to the point that you wanted to see more of that character. More often, I was thinking, 'go away'.I guess the funniest part of the movie was in the closing credits when Ferrell, Reilly and Duncan were seen enjoying themselves in out-takes. Glad they had fun but it is too bad I didn't.This movie finished 2 out of 10 laps as far as I was concerned. Once it hit the pits, it never got back in the race.",2,15,32,4 August 2006
