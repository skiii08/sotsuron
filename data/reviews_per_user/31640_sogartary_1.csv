Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Unusual
","One suggestion for the non-English speaking, don't watch the movie if you don't have a good English. The way you perceive the movie will change drastically, if you have lived for a while with citizens of the former USSR in a English speaking environment. I don't know if Kazakhs speak like that, but Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian have this kind of accent. The main character imitates very well this. The unreal grotesque of the presented cultural difference must not be taken as it's face value, like some people do. The grandfather of a friend of mine, who fought in the Second World War and suffered the invasion of the Red army in Bulgaria, was telling me that some of the Kazakhs in the ranks of the Red army haven't seen a hand watch by that time. I don't know what Sacha Baron Cohen was trying to present, but the movie ridicules the outdated view of many Americans for some parts of the World, who only left their home towns to go on a vacation in Florida for Christmas and New Year's. The singularity of the movie creates huge disapprobation, like most of the unique productions do.",10,2,17,24 December 2006
