The Blair Witch Project," Tripe
","What can I say about this film that hasn't been said before? How about, I'm glad it's not in the top 250!Hammed-up acting, bad script, bad idea, bad everything. The only reason this film was successful was the hype surrounding the 'is it real?' element. Sure, if you think people act badly in real life.I will say this though, in reality 'plots' don't exist, life is just a bunch of events. That's where this film shines, the plot is realistically incoherent and flow less. Is it a good idea to base a film on the things about life that don't work in film? No.I hope this film goes down in history as something that was hyped up beyond reproach and then turned out to be one of the worst films in recent history. I couldn't believe this was the same film I'd heard about once I'd left the cinema, and they",3,0,2,20 May 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Twice as pointless as Magnolia and half as entertaining
","Firstly, as an anti-drugs film this is flawed, because the characters come across as being generally dislikeable regardless. Secondly, instead of pier-pressure or anything like that, these people chose to become drug addicts.Apart from the drug related messages in this film there's nothing of interest, there's no dialogue, no humour, nothing. This film is void of anything remotely intriguing.Whether intentional or not: the TV show kept releasing more information throughout, but never completed itself. This alone made the film fall flat, because too much effort was put into a segment that was left unfinished and pointless. Unless there's some message about life being a TV show and dying early through drugs means you will never get to see the end (yes I'm reaching).My point is this: with this type of anti-entertainment film the only point in watching it is the messages and guidance it may contain within, but this film doesn't contain anything. It's just a crap story about crap characters that the writer decided he wasn't going to end properly.If you want an anti-drugs film that gets the message across far better, and actually is entertaining then check out Trainspotting. I get the impression from this film that this is an attempt at a `cleverer' Americanised remake, obviously the writer of Requiem For a Dream missed the point entirely.Pure rubbish - 1/10",1,17,37,26 January 2002
Shrek," Computer animation and toilet humour unite!
","I'm not a prude, far from it, but even I found certain elements of the film disgusting and unwarrented. Especially for a childrens film.Exibit A: Donkey urinates on a fire to put it out. Exibit B: Shrek farts in a pond, killing natural wildlife. Exibit C: Shrek farts, burps, etc. throughout the rest of the film.Normally I wouldn't mind, but there's no other humour in this flick. Apart from the 'Gingerbread Man' scene. Other attempts are poor at best, for example: the 'Robin Hood' scene, and crime on crime, he's doing the riverdance and is french (?!?!).Shrek wins the accolade of, 'Having the most predictable ending since The Sixth Sense'. Formulaic is this films middle name.On to the acting, it's not awful to say the least, apart from Mike Myers awful Scottish accent (even worse than in Austin Powers 2). John Lithgow is superb as usual, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy surpassed themselves.So then: to summerize, take your children to this film if you don't mind them laughing constantly as the main characters: fart, burp and urinate.",Null,0,0,11 July 2001
Evil Dead II," The funniest film ever made?
","The script, comic timing, and everything else that makes a great comedy is contained within this film. Instead of the serious, boring (seriously boring?) 'The Evil Dead' we're served up Troma style comedy with the worst looking blood a film has ever contained (looks like dyed water to me). You won't be able to stop the laughter, your jaw will hurt, your sides will split (and spill red water). You'll never look at your hands in the same way again, in fear of them trying to kill you! Don't watch this for the horror, because it doesn't even try to provide it.",Null,0,0,17 May 2002
