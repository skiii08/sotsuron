Your Name.," An entertaining film with gorgeous visual but mediocre plot with flaws.
","'kimi no na wa' is the recent addition to Shinkai collection which is a phenomenal success overnight but box office collection doesn't decide the quality of the film, the film like twilight earned in tons. Is it overrated?Yes,highly. Is it masterpiece?HAHAHHA,only if twilight is your favorite love story,on serious note just average.STORY-First of all the plot isn't original, to begin with,I could relate a lot of work that gives close resemblance. Let's start with 'Ditto' a Korean film where two people living twenty-one years apart in time able to contact each other through radio or 'Lake House' an American film with the same concept but the time difference is two years and mean of communication is through letters. Bringing another work to notice, 'It's a Boy Girl Thing' Where two individuals swapped bodies,adapted to their surroundings and over time fall in love. How does it sound? Finally mixed it up with Japanese settings and some unexplainable science fiction stuff,here comes the idea of masterminded plot for 'Kimi no na wa'SUMMING UP ALL THE POINTS IN SHORT-SUMMING UP ALL THE POINTS- (*) Promising start,entertaining to watch but nothing explain why they were swapping,they didn't even check the dates nor contacted each other for real,you didn't even care to look for the place where the girl is in neither the girl care to look for the boy. Plot convenience. (*)A strange girl gave you braided cord in train and you don't even know her,why care to keep it for three years?Plot convenience. (*)The relationship between the main characters were so vague,I know this is Shinkai's usual style but for a change I thought he'll give us something more but it turn out another clich√© romance,I wonder if the use of word 'romance' is right or not. Neither of them knows each other for real,just share the empty shell and experience each other lifestyle,suddenly feeling started to burst out from where? WOW. (*)The way he time travel back to save her,the way he convinced the friends in her bodies,the final execution to evacuate the village all feel so foolish and out of the line. (*)confusion of different timeline- It's the most complicated part,Mitsuha's timeline was parallel to Taki's timeline of three years ago,she eventually died over there. But the taki that had the body swapping and all the interaction with her is the one in the future three years ahead,so when he realized that he fall in despair and tried one last time to change the past and he succeeds in the most unrealistic way ever,anyway the thing is that what happen to two different timelines,did they merge or separated?we never got an explanation of that,it's like thing happens so let move on and observe the emotion not the logic behind it. If we bring the first couple of minutes in the film,we get a clear image what trigger the emptiness inside them,the feeling of missing something important in their life,it was since the day meteor pass by. -Taki in the current timeline never had the feeling before he interacted with her and even he had no knowledge of the meteor and stuff,he wakes up with vague memories in the mountain after the effort to save her whereas taki's of the different timeline was shown to have all the knowledge of the incident and even had the empty feeling ever since that day. For mitsuha,she might have more reference to what happen as in the ending,when taki asked her 'if they ever met',the way mitsuha reacted to give a good idea of that. The emotions aspect can never overshadow such part. MUSIC AND ANIMATION-Stunning visual with shivering music by 'RADWIMPS',literally the combination of this two somewhat make the the film enjoyable overshadowing the weak plot.ENJOYMENT-I got a mixed feeling about this,I thought it'll make me laugh,cry and would be a whole different experience for me,I did enjoy in the in the first half but as soon it progresses,It felt like the plot was trying too hard and with all those illogical stuff going on,nothing much to say.OVERALL-A decent film with pretty colors, the execution was good too but no near perfect, just above average.STOP LETTING YOUR EMOTION GET THE BEST OF YOU AND JUDGE LOGICALLY.",6,36,70,4 October 2016
