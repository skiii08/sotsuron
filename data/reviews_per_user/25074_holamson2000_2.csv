3:10 to Yuma," Subtle and courageous
","The acting from the two leading roles are absolutely brilliant. Christian Bale's performance is captivating as the one-legged rancher fighting for his family. In fact, he takes over much of the attention at should be given to Russell Crowe as well. Crowe is given a hard and complicated role, yet he did brilliantly. In my opinion, Crowe's character, the outlaw Ben Wade is the more interesting. It is like the film is just a glimpse of Wade's life where there is so much more going on. Many people will be confused at the end by Wade's choices. But if we watch Crowe more carefully, there are many subtle hints through out the movie that will explain a lot about this special character, that in the end, you won't be able to characterize him as good or bad. The film is beautifully directed, very well paced. The music and cinematography are powerfully done. The only weak point of this movie is the acting of Logan Lerman who plays William. But it is a hard role for a young actor so it's understandable. This is one of those movie that will grow on you as you watch it over and over. I rate it 9/10.",9,2,4,15 January 2008
Slumdog Millionaire," Hip teenage story, morally weak
","On the upside, the directing and editing for this movie is quite good, totally deserving of the nominations. The 'hip' titled camera angle is rather gratuitous, but overall the cinematography is a plus point. The music is interesting, but not outstanding. Now for the downside, this is meant to be an entertaining, feel good movie. Yet it contains one particularly violent scene that can be mood-snuffer. (Those who watched it know which one I'm talking about). None of the 'good' characters in the movie are morally strong enough to the challenge the violence that they face. (Alert the police or something for Pete's sake!) I can't say more on this point without making this comment a spoiler. On the other hand, the children violence portrayed is worse than child-slavery, and I doubt it can exist in this day and age. Yet the film shows it for the sake of thrilling the audience. In my humble opinion, I highly disapprove of this. All in all, this movie is an achievement in the artistic point of view, but the morally weak story will not make the hype last long enough to be a classic. If Rocky (one of my favorites) gets 8.0 rating, I think number 7 is a generous rating for this film.",7,2,5,25 January 2009
