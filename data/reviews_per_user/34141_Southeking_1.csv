Your Name.," A true life changer movie , a true masterpiece that you ill not forget
","I remember once i was studying story boarding and scenario , one of my teacher who was really wise in everything let's say ... he tell us that if you wanna get a masterpiece project you should give it a special identity that identify your culture in term culture life and mythological story and finally a creative love story cause love is what our life stand on ... during watching this movie i was impressed of the contrast they make between the characters , the places , the culture the religion the mythological past and the story line , that in term of story and creativity 
when i pass to rate the 2D drawing , the animation and the art , everything was perfect and more , the environment was unique the details was unbelievable and as an animator i can say that the animation was more than amazing each frame and each pose and even the acting was wooooow <3<3 , finally the character was magnificent even voice actor and the music are awesome that touch your soul and move your heart .... 
the studio was really focusing in all the details they really make a movie thay i cannot forget or get bored from it even after watching it more than 5 times <3 <3 and that what i did truly",10,0,1,4 October 2018
