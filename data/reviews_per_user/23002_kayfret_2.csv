Deepwater Horizon," Does what it says on the tin...
","An action-thriller disaster movie based on true events - basically you go in already knowing what to expect and that's pretty much what you get. I certainly wasn't bored, but I also wasn't overly thrilled. The tension does build up to good effect, though unfortunately there were no standout moments or performances. (I've never been a Mark Wahlberg fan, though he is perfectly tolerable here, Kurt Russell is decent, as is John Malkovich, though I found his Cajun accent jarring). Loss of human life is, of course, tragic and it's understandable that this was the focus, but I'm disappointed that they barely even mentioned the horrific ecological disaster that followed.",6,5,8,19 October 2016
Arrival," Clever, contemplative and dreamlike...
","I was expecting a good movie as I enjoyed the recent Prisoners and Sicario by the same director. This turned out to be a GREAT movie! If you've seen the trailer you'd be forgiven for thinking this is a standard alien invasion film, and perhaps that you've seen all the best bits already. But Arrival is clever, contemplative and dreamlike, and not short of surprises. Amy Adams is wonderful and her character carries the entire film. In fact, for a film about aliens, the overwhelming theme is of humanity. The main message is one that is extremely important to me - we are all in this together and communication is the key.",8,4,12,1 November 2016
