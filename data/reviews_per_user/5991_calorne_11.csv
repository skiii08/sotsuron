The Hangover," Why is this not funny?
","Elsewhere on the web I have seen comment saying that people in the USA find the film funnier than UK folk. There seems to be the suggestion that there is a completely different sense of humour between the countries. I do not think this is right. I am from the U.K. and I think there is fabulous comedy from the USA. Great USA comedies from over the years easily spring to mind; Some Like it Hot, Harvey, Nelson Dynamite, Brother Where Art Thou and on and on. When it comes to TV series, Seinfeld, for example, is fantastic. I loved the episode about the English Patient in which 'Elaine' voiced precisely what I felt about the film in the funniest way.But the Hangover neither made me laugh nor smile. I saw no funny wit and no funny slapstick. Incidentally, I watched a few episodes of Friends recently and noted that there is some terrific slapstick there that I had not picked up on before, often involving 'Ross'.",2,1,2,10 July 2018
Aquaman," Decent enough but Animation rather overbearing
","Overall I found the narrative pretty engaging and so kept watching, but I found the fishy animation rather out of plaice with the 'reality' scenes.",6,1,2,20 March 2020
The Bourne Identity," Great action packed thriller.
","This is a great film that I have seen a few times now and it never gets old.The movie flows very well with a combination of action and detective work. There are some great moments of detail such as the short climb down the outside of the American Embassy. Not a spectacular climb by any means, but plausible and well observed and it made me want to try it, but I would want a big air bag at the bottom just in case. I think the fight choreography is very good and appears realistic to me and lots of scenes remain in the memory such as the out-witting of the Clive Owen character in the countryside and the car chase with the little mini.Within the imaginary world of the film the characters all perform well and true to the story.",9,0,0,10 July 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Good entertainment - Spoiler alert
",Some great thrills and spills. Really terrific stunts.I was cross with Ethan for saving Benjie though. Even though Benjie was less goofie than in the last outing I was still rooting for his demise.,3,0,1,18 June 2020
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Great action, but square Pegg and an anomaly in the creaky script.
","Overall some great scenes and exciting action. But Simon Pegg didn't work in this and was an awkward distraction rather than a smoothly integral part of the film. At times it was veering toward Clouseau. He is a great writer and comedian, but not a plausible Mission Impossible character, especially so when, or so it appeared, he was directed to try to throw in a bit of Ricky Gervais into his performance. I hope Simon Pegg does lots more fabulous comedy in other films, but that his character meets a swift and tragic end in MI.Also, the ending did not make sense as it was completely at odds to something we were told earlier.",6,0,0,14 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Compromised by factual links
",There were some very funny moments including the canine capers and also Pitt & DiCaprio are a great pairing. But I felt that linking the story to a factual crime compromised this work. What could have been a much shorter and soaring tale of pure imagination was hampered and brought somewhat clumsily down to earth by pinning on to it elements of true life.This is the second film I have seen recently (Transit was the other one) which is blighted by narration.The excellent sound track (Neal Diamond and the Stones were my favourites) failed to lift this to an above average Tarantino outing.,5,3,7,16 August 2019
Mary and Max," Enjoyable animation marred by sound problems
","I enjoyed spending time with Max and Mary and learning about their struggles with life and their attempts to understand and overcome. It is a quite dark but entertaining tale which includes consideration of the day to day impact of conditions such as loneliness and Asperger's syndrome. It is irreverent, but I think the overall message is one of hope and understanding.I saw this on Amazon Prime. It was one of those gems that are buried away on the site. I found it by chance, searching the name of the film as it was recommended on Kermode & Mayo.I do not know if this is unique to Prime, but the sound was off - with the narration way too low in the soundscape so that it could not be heard clearly or at all when there was music or background sound.",7,1,1,4 October 2019
Cloud Atlas," A great movie
",A number of interwoven stories that work synergistically so that the the overall appreciation of this film is somehow greater than the simple addition of the individual parts. It put me in mind of Crash but with the added dimension of time.,9,2,3,3 July 2018
Green Book," A well acted and entertaining story
","The two male leads were excellent, both really brought the characters to life and both had strong interesting traits. It is often funny but it also brings us examples of man's inhumanity to man. Viggo Mortensens' character had quite an appetite - reminiscent of Joey in friends. I can well relate to folk who enjoy their food.",8,0,1,14 June 2019
Annihilation," Interesting, enjoyable, engaging.
","This was a train journey tablet watch and so I may have enjoyed it even more on the big screen.I could not help but compare it to Arrival, which I found insipid and dull by comparison.Annihilation is a great film, although it does have its flaws. I thought the line 'So it is alien' near the end was one of the worst film lines ever. Yes, it's alien, imagine that, it could so easily have been from the far aisles of Tesco Metro (sarcasm alert).I was engaged throughout, I thought the main spousal characters were enigmatic and intriguing. The progression of the story made sense within its own set up and still provided surprises. There was horror and paranoia along with camaraderie and self-development. The monsters were monstrous wth a twist. The science was comprehensible and plausible. There was, in my view, poetic imagery which was pleasing to the eye.All in all a very good sci fi / fantasy watch.",8,5,12,15 March 2018
Joy," Forty minutes too long
","Jennifer Lawrence, Edgar Ramirez and Bradley Cooper put in creditable performances. However, the scenes with Robert de Niro and Isabella Rossellini, especially one involving a document signing are poor and contribute to making what good have been a good movie irritating and disjointed. The issues relating to patents were handled in a clumsy and half-hearted way and this could have been played out with more intelligence and intrigue.",2,0,2,10 February 2018
