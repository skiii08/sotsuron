The Lobster," One word review: awful
","The lobster is possibly one of the worst movies ever made.
The characters are thrown in a dystopian world where singles have 45 days to get back on track and find a soul mate or be transformed into animals. And it gets even worse. Inmates at the 'coupling hotel', which is a mix between a lunatic asylum and the love boat, are forced to hunt each other with anaesthetic darts to prolong their stay at the hotel and get more chances to mate.
Acting is pretty dreadful: Colin Farrel could not act to save his life, and apparently it was an 'artistic' choice to make all characters behave like lobotomy patients.
The hero does not get a better deal with the revolutionaries, singles that chose to live in the woods, and whose rules are even more stringent.
In the end, if you have to choice between watching 'the lobster' or doing anything else, including plucking your nose for two hours, please choose the latter.",1,5,6,13 July 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Amazing tale of redemption
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a movie about making extreme choices and dealing with the consequences.
As other reviewers noted, character development reaches new heights here.
All characters, no matter how negative they appear, or how badly they behave, get the chance to show their good side.
The movie starts with a pretty grim settings: the mother of a raped and murdered teen-ager is ravaged by guilt and tries to expedite the investigation (a 7 months old case with no leads and no witnesses) by renting three billboards on a secondary road (where her daughter was murdered on her way home) and displaying three (barely) legal taunting signs addressed to the chief of police.
The main characters are all wonderfully cast (Frances McDormand as the bereaved mother, Woody Harrelson as the chief of police and Sam Rockwell as the dim-witted, macho, racist and closet homosexual cop).
The director plays with stereotypes, but the only constant is that in the end almost all are broken. There is decency in every single character: the letters from the grave by Chief Willoughby are particularly touching, and so are the displays of forgiveness by the two characters that (physically) suffer the most in the movie.
All the individuals are given a chance to redeem themselves (and they make good use of it), with the exception of the unspecified townsfolk.
Small town people cannot stick to their own business, so what should have been a direct confrontation becomes a confrontation between factions, with the typical mob behaviour that is so American.
The ending shows that even in the worst possible scenario there is still hope. 
With the rapid decline of our civilisation, we can only believe it's true.",8,0,1,20 June 2018
