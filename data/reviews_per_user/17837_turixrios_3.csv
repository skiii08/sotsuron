Ford v Ferrari," The Perfect Lap
","With it's fast pace and long runtime, this movie doesn't waste your time. It tells a beautiful story of two men achieving what was thought impossible at the time, and about the people who helped them make it happen.It was a lot of fun, better than I expected, and emotional. There were some scenes that almost made me cry because the movie made me so invested into the characters. Christian and Matt have so much chemistry it's insane.My only flaw is that they portray Ferrari too negatively at times, but the story needs an antagonist. And Im glad they didn't go overboard with that, but it was kind of annoying since I like Ferrari.",9,2,3,18 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," This is where the fun begins.
","Not a single Star Wars movie has surpassed this in the last 15 years...From it's inspired and tragic story; almost if inspired by Greek Tragedies of old, to it's amazing visuals and score. This movie was such an improvement and remains to this day my favorite prequel.The irony of Anakin's fate and how everything wraps together like a nice present is delightful, the only flaws I could give this movie it's at times it's wooden dialogue and acting (although much improved since Eps 1-2).The themes explored in this movie and it's uncompromising way for telling the story George Lucas had always wanted to tell makes this one of my favorites. I could spoil some things, but I rather not. Even if this movie is almost 15 years old.",9,12,13,17 January 2020
Tombstone," Tombstone is a true Western!
","This movie has good action set pieces, very funny jokes, iconic dialogue and great performances. Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday and Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp sets this film apart from the other adaptations, it's just too good.My only issue is with the pacing near the end of the film and the very beginning, but it's a minor complaint compared to the rest of this Western.Beautifully shot and directed, this is in my opinion one of the best Westerns out there. Such a classic movie!",9,2,4,19 November 2018
