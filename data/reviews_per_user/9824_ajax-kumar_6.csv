Ford v Ferrari," Don't go by the name... There's lot more to the movie
","It is a well crafted movie with every scene and actor well chosen. Christian Bale and Matt Damon were amazing. The movie takes you a part of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles's life and how their combined passion, ambition, determination and dedication lead them to a success which everyone thought impossible. It's the kind of movie you can watch again and again.",9,1,2,23 November 2019

Avengers: Endgame," A beautiful ending
","I will not call it a fitting ending.. but it was definitely beautiful. The movie ensures that every character is given enough space, but not too much. The ending battle is epic! But what stole my heart was the credits. It's a must watch for the franchisee fans.",9,42,66,22 June 2019

The Lion King," The remake has its hits and misses.
","Firstly.. I am a big fan of the original LionKing. So when Disney decided to remake the LionKing, I knew I had to see it. What's good.. the CG looks very real and at no point in time does it look unreal. You want to believe that the Lions are really talking or moving. It's almost a remake of the original movie scene to scene.. almost. What's bad.. certain scenes in the original movie had a lot of charm.. like Rafiki advising Simba to come back, which I thought was quite tame in the remake. Because the original movie was animated the expressions from the characters added to the emotional scenes which could not be achieved in the remake. Watchable.. but I am still a fan of the original movie.",6,3,4,24 August 2019
