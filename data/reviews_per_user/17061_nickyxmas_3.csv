Angels & Demons," Lighting up the Ridiculous
","Before we start this action packed, edge of your seat review of Angels and Demons I am going to take a little time out to explain to you what a film review is, the origins of film criticism and why knowing this will help you understand the subsequent paragraphs. Now you might be thinking, this is a little long winded I want to get to the action, I can pick up on the theory as I go along Well if you are thinking this, and I wouldn't blame you, I wouldn't recommend you see Angels and Demons! Let me attempt a brief overview of where we are before we hit the main review (Ron Howard, David Koepp take note). Following on from the critically panned but box office success of The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown's novel Angels and Demons reunites Ron Howard and Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon in another religion come politics come art history romp against time. There done! Having read both Dan Brown novels, Angels and Demons is by far the more entertaining book and should on all counts be a better film, which to be fair it is However this is like saying being crucified upright is better than being crucified upside down – there really isn't much in it and either way it is going to be pretty miserable.One of the many criticisms thrown at The Da Vinci Code was the film's inability to balance the historical storytelling with the modern day action, which in the end slowed the narrative to a plodding lethargic bus ride of a movie. Ron Howard has obviously listened to his critics; by stripping a lot of unnecessary narrative from the book the overall film seems much lighter on its feet, which in general is a good thing. Langdon jumps in cars and runs around Rome with a map in this one! However and here is my big concern the dialogue is appalling. We still have the tour book commentary from the know-it-all Langdon, who doesn't talk to people he lectures them. The plot twists are inevitable and completely ludicrous and don't even get me started on Ewan McGregor's accent or ability to fly helicopters. If you thought Sean Connery's Irish accent was bad in The Untouchables MY GOD! The joy of discovery is totally lost in this film with over explanation after over explanation completely bombing any finer detail out what could have been a decent if not particularly clever plot.Condescending, unsophisticated and ultimately ridiculous The Vatican must be wondering what it was so worried about. This film isn't anti-Catholic it is anti-intelligent.",3,10,27,27 May 2009
The Young Victoria," Victoria Sponge
","Britain's longest serving Monarch gets a style makeover in The Young Victoria, transforming her from a grief stricken Judi Dench to a young and feisty Emily Blunt (with snazzy clothes, pearly white teeth and a spray on tan).The film follows Victoria as a queen in waiting, unable to take control of her life and the throne until she is 18. Imprisoned in her Kensington Palace, she is bullied by a power hungry politician who has been allowed to rule the family nest by her weak willed mother. All the while overseas her uncle is training a young Prince Albert the art of seducing the soon to be Queen in the hope of retaining some political advantage over his rivals in Europe. You can imagine the young Princess feeling trapped, used almost like a pawn in some sort of chess match well actually you don't need to imagine it, the obvious metaphors and visual imagery give it away. Constant shots of gates shutting, keys turning, and doors slamming do the trick and if this doesn't work the chess game between Victoria and Albert with all eyes watching should hammer it home.The overburden narrative picks up pace once Victoria takes over the throne from William IV (played by a bellowing but amusing Jim Broadbent). The costumes and locations become more sumptuous as we are introduced to the world in which Victoria must find her feet. This she does, skipping lightly into her court only to be faced with the sudden realisation that life as a Queen can be a lonely one. She makes mistakes, faces tough decisions and relies on advisors that perhaps have their own interests in mind (draw your obvious comparisons to Cate Blancett's rip roaring Elizabeth I here). Sidelined in Germany, Albert must wait until he is summoned by the Queen to take his place by her side. Once he does the love story takes stride and it is satisfyingly sweet although not as bodice ripping as one might have hoped.This is the crux of the problem; the film is merely satisfying on a visual leave, more Victorian Sponge than Crème Brule. The plot's political conspiracies are not deceptive enough to carry the story so tends to falter and the two love interests do not see enough of each other to make this film burn with passion. The decision to fictionalise parts of the story by allowing Prince Albert to get shot while trying to protect Victoria from an assassin just makes the flaws in the narrative all the more obvious. It is a shame because the cast is full of strong actors and the story of Queen Victoria and the era in which she reigned is fascinating. Personally I would like to have seen more of the intense desire and attraction that Albert and Victoria shared which produced nine children and led her to mourn his passing everyday for the 40 years that followed his death.Stunning costumes - tick. Gorgeous scenery  tick. Romance and Intrigue at court  tick. The Young Victoria is a paint by numbers historical drama, beautiful to look at but could do with a little more originality and substance.",5,24,43,6 March 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Enchanting
","Any good critic will tell you that when you write a review you should start by introducing the plot, examine the overarching themes of the film, and then reveal your personal opinion which of course will be grounded in cinematic theory, and I would normally go along with this But if Benjamin Button has taught me anything it is that life is too short, so I'm just going to come right out and say it. I loved this film! From the intriguing beginning to the heart breaking end I was enchanted.Based on an F Scott Fitzgerald short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button sweeps you up and carries you on an epically intimate portrayal of a life lived backwards. The film follows Benjamin as he makes his way from birth as an old man through middle age to youth. Along the way he meets a fantastical array of characters, he triumphs and he encounters tragedy, he finds love, loses it and finds it again. Like Forrest Gump (also written by Eric Roth) Benjamin Button dances through a life touched by extraordinary events with wide-eyed innocence and naive charm, he meets his 'jenny' in the form of Daisy and their love story is intricately weaved through the history of the 20th Century.It is to David Fincher's complete credit and talent as a filmmaker that the comparisons to Forrest Gump stop there. It would have been very easy to take this film down a path of bombarding imagery and obvious song choices but instead Fincher serves up a film swimming in warmth, sentimentality and whimsical reality. But let's not forget, this is still a David Fincher film; along with the romance we have unforgiving melancholy. Fincher takes his time getting his two love interests together, for the first half of the film both characters flit in and out of each others lives all the while the audience are astutely aware that time will catch up on them. Finally Fincher allows us to enjoy them together by presenting a montage of chocolate box moments but the idealism is soon replaced by reality, their love always will be fleeting. Indeed this is the heartbeat of the film, love in all forms, whether it is a mother's love or friendship, comes and goes. Time does not allow us to hold on and it doesn't matter which way we move through life, we can't rewind it.The visual imagery is spectacular, from the faux 1920s shutter camera to the techniques used to age the actors; Benjamin Button is a feast for the eyes. What is even more impressive is the ability of the actors to make the special effects seem so natural, no more so than Brad Pitt. Is this Brad Pitt's finest performance? No, but I do think it is he's most accomplished. He carries the film with such subtlety and restraint that it would be simple to overlook his character as nothing more than a passive observer, however there are scenes where through Pitt's acting skills Benjamin Button personality shines. The supporting cast are also top notch, leading the charge are the ever wonderful Cate Blancett and scene stealing Taraji P. Henson.So as I said, I loved this film. With Awards season upon us it is becoming apparent that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button will not be winning as many awards as it has been nominated for which isn't a surprise if Brad Pitt and David Fincher's awards CVs are anything to go by. I don't think it much matters; this film already feels like a classic for the ages. Unlike Benjamin and Daisy's love for each other The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is timeless and we as an audience will be able to rewind it and enjoy it forever.",9,1,3,13 February 2009
