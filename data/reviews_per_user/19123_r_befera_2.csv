Scarface," Great movie
","When I first saw this movie my first reaction was ' incredible ' . How can a Cuban immigrant become one of America's most powerful drug-lord. Well it's possible and this movie shows the life of Tony Montana, and in it's 2 hour and 30 minutes it never fails to deliver and it never bores. If you're expecting a action packed unbelievable movie well don't see this movie because this movie it's what it's all about in life : money , greed , love. And the moment when money and greed starts to take over love that's the moment where there is no future for America's most powerful drug-lord.This movie changed my life 10/10",10,1,2,18 June 2006
The Secret in Their Eyes," Possibly the best foreign thriller of the year !
","This is another good foreign thriller , one that could have been made by Hollywood ! The movie tells about the Morales case spread out over 25 years . We meet Benjamin Esposito who is a retired criminal investigator who decides to write a novel about the case , where a young girl was brutally raped and murdered . It sure isn't a movie about who has done it , in fact we already know that very early in the movie ; because of the flashbacks. The flashbacks tells us about the case when Benjamin was working on it . There is a constant degree of high performance acting in this movie especially Ricardo Darin ( EL AURA , NUEVE REINAS )who gives another solid performance . In fact this movie is more about the people who get left behind when someone we love dies . It's about loss , dozens of memories and bittersweet revenge . Oh and another thing ..... with such a powerful ending of the movie we learn another thing about the cruel nature of us human beings . There are a few thrillers that get a high rating from me , in fact the only thriller that i gave a high rating this year was SHUTTER ISLAND from Martin Scorsese , now i have found another one ..... It really deserves every point that i'm giving it . 8 / 10 .",8,7,11,17 April 2010
