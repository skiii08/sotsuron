Angels & Demons," Hideous
","This is one of the most boring films I have watched in ages. It was dragged out to the point where I almost fell asleep! Tom Hanks and Ewan McGregor acted well but the plot was terrible. As someone else commented, it kept hopping from one thing to the other and never really explained properly why certain things were happening. The last half an hour was most probably the worst. So stupid and pointless. I like the way that the police kept leaving Tom Hanks and his co-partner alone! Like that would happen? Several scenes are left with them and the baddie alone - that just wouldn't happen. Well, maybe once but several - naaah! I kept shaking my head thinking, this is ridiculous. I like fantasy in a movie, as do most people, but when the film is trying to be serious, then no. What a waste of a couple of hours - wish I'd read a book! lol.",Null,1,4,7 August 2009
