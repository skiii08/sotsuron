Skyfall," Gripping and Entertaining!
","I've heard mixed reviews from people prior to watching Skyfall. Hence, I entered the cinema without setting any high expectations. Boy, was I blown away by the outcome! (I watched the film twice).Skyfall carries a darker and sullen theme compared to the past Bond movies. Here, Bond is depicted as a vulnerable, struggling CIA agent. He isn't deemed as fit anymore after suffering a serious injury (that costs him 4 ribs and some not so vital organs), yet he stubbornly tries to regain his 'licensed-to-kill' character and proves his ability to everyone else. Bond's process in doing so is fascinating to watch as we get to connect with him emotionally. In Skyfall, it isn't all about flashy go-go gadgets. Bond is simply armed with a simple Walters and a radio. No exploding pens or whatsoever. Even the Bond ladies are just a sprinkled few. The show's focus is going 'back in time'. A more intimate side of Bond that we've never seen before in the past films – His family, childhood, birthplace- is revealed. Then there's the James Bond car, a silver Aston Martin DB5. Oh so classic and adorable.Daniel Craig's portrayal as James Bond was excellent. He comes across as fierce and gritty yet surprisingly witty at times. He brings a lot of depth to his character as he not only appears strong, but also has a fragile and more 'human' side to him. (It really got to me when he shed tears). Judi Dench was amazing. It's refreshing that her relationship with Bond is pivotal in this film. The main highlight in this movie would be Javier Bardem. His portrayal as the campy villain Silva is played with perfection. Silva is a slick, notorious, maniacal individual whose life goal is to seek vengeance against his former employer. He exuberates insanity, yet there is also a comical side of him which I deeply enjoy. Ben Whishaw as the new Q brings some hilarity into the movie. Who knew Q would be so technologically competent yet old-fashioned at the same time? Ralph Fiennes, best known as HP's Voldemort, is likable as the tough agency boss, Gareth Mallory. However, the movie is not entirely smooth-sailing. There are a few bits that are questionable; however, one can easily overlook them. The Bond girls are dispensable – Naomi Harris is decent. Her character has an easygoing and solid friendship going with Mr Bond but did not develop into something deeper. Berenice Marlohe is incredibly alluring but....she died way too soon.Skyfall is the best Bond movie for me, hands down, and Daniel Craig is now officially my favorite Bond. The action scenes are terrific,the cinematography is stunning and the plot and characters are immensely engaging. If you are into high-tech Bond gadgets and perhaps more Bond girls scenes, this movie may not be your cup of tea.",7,3,10,14 November 2012
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel Slays it Once Again! Bravo!!!
","I had a feeling that Captain America: Winter Soldier would be an amazing movie once the trailer was released. Turns out, I couldn't be more accurate. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is not the usual superhero movie, it underlies a dark theme of politics and conspiracy beneath it. Haunting pasts, betrayals and fake deaths all come into play. In this film, we get to see Steve Rogers' full potential in terms of his heroism and leadership. When the leader of S.H.E.I.L.D., Nick Fury, takes the fall, it is up to Steve Rogers to determine the fate of S.H.E.I.L.D and most importantly, the livelihood of mankind. As the stoic and fearless hero that he is, Rogers takes charge and enlists the help of Natasha Romanoff aka The Black Widow as well as a new sidekick, Sam Wilson aka Falcon, to defeat HYDRA. He exuberates skills that we have never seen before with his gravity defying flips, kicks and punches, even single handedly defeating a whole vessel of villains. It is also exciting to see the strong bond between Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon. The trios are as loyal as ever to one another, never once faltering despite near death scenarios and with multitude obstacles being hurled their way like a violent hurricane. They displayed excellent teamwork in the process of defeating the baddies. The movie also sheds some light and heart-warming moments as well. The playful and snarky banter between good friends Natasha and Steve is fun to watch. The escalator scene, anyone? Also, the scene between Steve and his former love, Peggy was priceless. Here, we get to see the vulnerable and raw side of the Captain which he hides so well on a daily basis.This film is a perfect blend of thrill, action and drama with an intriguing plot. The action sequences are plentiful; there is not just one 'special' moment. I was gawking and gripping the edge of my seat throughout the movie. The stunts are top notch and are the best in its genre, perhaps even triumphing the likes of action movies. There are tons of extraordinary fighting combats, insane car chases and fiery explosions that would blow you off your feet. All the actors did a splendid job in portraying their characters convincingly, particularly Chris Evans, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson. Scarlett has a major role and takes up pretty much most of the screen time; so take note of this, fanboys.Captain America: Winter Soldier has claim its spot as the best Marvel movie ever produced in my list as it exceeds my expectations in every single way. I daresay it is even better than The Avengers (It is a large statement to make as I am a massive Avengers fan). I can't wait to see the next installment of the Captain America sequel and The Avengers: Age of Ultron. Bring it on, Marvel!",10,35,59,28 March 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Another Splendid Score by Whedon
","Avengers: Age of Ultron casts a different mood from the first movie. Age of Ultron is significantly darker and grittier than 2012's Avengers, which has a funnier and lighter tone. The new enemy, Ultron, is actually a handiwork of Tony Stark. Ultron is a formidable machine with wicked dreams. To create a new and better world, Ultron believes human beings need to be sacrificed to give way to the birth of a new society. Age of Ultron sets movie goers on an emotional journey. The vulnerabilities of the valiant avengers were revealed in flashes and we get a better understanding of the characters' pasts and fears. We also see the avengers turning against each other in a moment of conflict and the strong bonds they formed on the verge of breaking. A particular avenger even thought of 'running away' because he feels that he is a threat. Despite all the obstacles, they managed to put aside their differences and assemble as a team once again. In Cap's words, if they are going to defeat Ultron, they are going to do it 'together'.Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner reprise their existing roles to perfection. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, who is somewhat a mystery in the last film, enjoys extensive screen time and character development in Age of Ultron. There are many sweet 'science bros' moments between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner that are fun to watch. The unexpected romance between Natasha and Bruce caught me by surprise because there is no indication at all in the first movie. Nevertheless, it adds a warm touch to the movie. Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are remarkable in their roles, playing Pietro (Quicksilver) and Wanda (Scarlet Witch), the Maximoff twins. Both of them share great chemistry as on-screen siblings. Wanda is an exciting character as she goes through so much regret and pain in this movie, and her powers is a force to be reckon with. James Spader totally nailed his performance as Ultron and Paul Bettany's role as Vision is outstanding as well. There are brief appearances by ex-boss Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Falcon, all doing their best to support the avengers team. As expected, there is no short of action, fight scenes and uber cool CGIs. The scene where the avengers stood in a circle and fought the enemies coming from all direction is pretty badass.Age of Ultron has a few let downs. The movie sheds some funny tears, with sprinkle of one-liners and cheeky quips. The Thor hammer scenes and fight between The Hulk and the Hulkbuster Armor is hilarious. However, the humour appeal is certainly not on par as the latter. The first film is so effortlessly entertaining with its many comical moments (Loki vs Hulk, Hulk saves Iron Man) and priceless dialogues (Stark quoting Shakespeare, Loki's mewling quim). Sadly, Age of Ultron simply does not have the same effect as the first (One-liners aren't that funny). Character development is a tad lacking for the old characters besides Hawkeye. Too many characters perhaps? The ending also felt sort of anti-climatic. Overall, Age of Ultron is a cinematic fest with a strong cast, decent storyline and loads of fancy action. It's still quite a good movie despite minor flaws. 7.8/10.",8,1,6,27 April 2015
Furious 7," For Paul.
","I'm an avid fan of the Fast & Furious franchise and even more so since Fast Five was released. Paul Walker's passing have left me stunned and saddened beyond measure and left me wondering on how Furious 7 will turn out with his absence. The end product has turned out pretty good as I imagined it would be. James Wan (of Saw, Insidious and Conjuring fame), with his fresh take on action movies, has created a bigger, better, faster and louder movie than its predecessors. The movie starts off with the introduction of the new villain, Deckard Shaw (Jason Staham), the big brother of Owen Shaw who appeared in the last two movies. Deckard Shaw's mission is to eliminate the people who are responsible in the downfall of his brother. Furious 7 is all brawls and bangs and jumps right into action right off the bat. Agent Hobbs discovers Shaw hacking into his office computer to retrieve information about the crew. We are greeted with an intense battle between Agent Hobbs and Shaw, which sees Shaw succeeding in injuring Hobbs with explosives.The original crew is back once again with their familiar faces and kick-ass energy. With Hobbs out of the picture, they have to hunt down Shaw on their own. Shaw has blown up Dom's house via a bomb package and killed their crew member Han, reiterating the need to track down this dangerous man as soon as possible. Deckard Shaw, however, is a lurking shadow and virtually untraceable – that is, till they met Mr. Nobody and Ramsey the Hacker; in addition to having their hands on 'God's Eye'. However, things went South at an alarming pace. Shaw has formed a secret alliance with a terrorist who is eager to coerce Ramsey into helping them control the 'God's Eye'. Furious 7 delivers a non-stop action fest in its two and a half hours entirety. Bountiful car chases, death defying crashes, leaps between fast moving vehicles, crazy shooting and colorful explosions ensure viewers that there is not a dull moment. There are also many fancy camera tricks used by Wan that I really like. The most memorable action scenes would be the 'car drop from sky' over Caucasus Mountains and 'flying car jump' through the magnificent Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. How very creative, insane and ridiculous.Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, Tyrese and Ludracris shine through their roles and display solid acting. As always, Diesel plays the cool, headstrong leader, with Walker as the equally strong and fearless sidekick, Rodriguez as the tough cookie, Tyrese and Ludracris as the witty, bickering old 'couple'. Nathalie Emmanuel did a decent job as the sexy and smart hacker Ramsey and Kurt Russell as the mysterious yet helpful Mr. Nobody. Staham's good as what he does, playing the elusive, gun-wielding, grenade master Shaw. Johnson has his share of limelight by appearing at the final hours to save the day as the last minute hero. Furious 7 has its touching moments. When Letty painfully clutched at an unconscious Dom and recalled her old memories, I almost shed a tear. The final beach scene that bides farewell to Paul Walker and character Brian is beautiful and simply perfect. The gazes written on the faces of every crew member as they look upon Brian and his family is a mixture of emotions – pain, sadness, longing - as they say their final goodbyes to their close friend and brother-in-arms. 'For Paul.' These two simple words shook me to the core and brought me a new wave of sadness all over again. I cried.In a nutshell, Furious 7 is a popcorn fest, with its galore of fast cars, hot chicks, high octane action but also serves as beautiful tribute to the late Paul Walker. Non-action fans may not appreciate the movie as the stunts are over-the-top and breaks every law of physics known to mankind. You just have to suspend your disbelief and stop questioning whether Vin Diesel is a human or android in order to fully enjoy the movie. Watch the movie, for the memory of Paul.",8,1,4,18 April 2015
