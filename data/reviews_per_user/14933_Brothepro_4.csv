Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I kind of like
","When people were telling me about the jokes in Borat, my immediate instinct was to watch this film, because it sounded hilarious. Critics, comedians and cinema lovers alike heaped praise on this film for being the funniest thing in 2006. So did it deserve the hype it got or was it just sheer over-rated fodder. I can tell you it's neither. Whilst being outrageously funny the film does repeats its jokes a bit like sexytime. Also if you are easily offended this might not be the ideal comedy for you as the laws of political correctness are completely thrown out the window as it makes the likes of Team America the patron saint of being polite. Hopwver if you think rules are stupid then you will love this film. For me personally it did push my boundaries and I am quite sweary so it's basically a two way street. If you love gentler comedies then you will detest this if you love insults then you will be quoting this film for a long time. It's like marmite, you'll love it or hate it.",7,0,6,20 December 2007
Taxi Driver," Top 100 but not top 10
","Taxi Driver is in my opinion an extremely good film. But, and this is a big but, it does not deserve to be in the top 10 films ever which many film critics put it in their top 10.The story shows a man who is a taxi driver called Travis Bickle (who is played by Robert De Niro) wanting to get rid of what he calls the 'scum' in New York City. Seems simple. Well it is not just quite like that as you see him as an average joe at first falling in love with a girl called Betsy and he wants to help this young girl Iris who is a prostitute to get away from the 'scum.' Robert De Niro's characterisation of Travis is superb, as he plays this creep who keeps in track of things through a diary. His voice his body language, everything he does is brilliant as you can see his transformation from Mr Nobody to Mr Violent Hero. There is also a tiny bit of humour in there as well as the violent transformation. For example De Niro pointing guns at the mirror saying one of the most famous lines of all time, 'Are you talking to me?' The other characters though are not as good which in some ways are unsurprising as Robert De Niro reigns supreme as his character making the other characters look pathetic. Take Betsy, Bickle's love interest, she's plain and just a normal character. The problem is right there she is plain. Plain as a packet of Ready Salted crisps.She has nothing interesting about her except she supports senator Palatine which makes Bickle support him as well. That is the only thing that is remotely interesting. Although it did not help her getting a role that lasts for about twenty to thirty minutes.The great thing is that it's a clever, well-crafted film as there are many perceptions from Travis, Betsy and Iris. Travis thinks that Betsy is good looking, he wants to help Iris because she is young and has potential and he wants to clear the mess up in this town. Meanwhile Betsy thinks Travis a weird average joe and Iris perceives Bickle to be a 'nark' but she deep down realises that he wants to help her.Overall, Scorcese has done magnificent work here by getting you to know and feel like Travis as he unleashes the beast within him and that is a good portrayal of what we want to sometimes do where the bitter aggression we have deep down wants to be released destructively and it is sown excellently in this film. 9/10",9,1,3,15 July 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Different from the other films in the Die Hard series.
","Len Wiseman has been notorious for making and directing bad films such as Underworld and it's even worse sequel Underworld: Evolution. So it came as a surprise when he got the task of directing Die Hard 4.0 (Live Free or Die Hard in the United States.) Would this film with hardly known actors (excluding Bruve Willis) and a less than good director live up to the previous films standards? The answer is a definite yes. However if you are expecting a claustrophobic environment that the first two Die Hard's did and you did not enjoy Die Hard with a Vengeance then this is not the film for you. Die Hard 4.0 is widespread reaching from areas to Washington DC to Baltimore. Which by the way is even more than the free roaming Die Hard with a Vengeance. Therefore the action is guaranteed to be more explosive and wily and it certainly was like that as John McClane (played by Bruce Willis, of course) was sending cars into the air and jumping off planes. But the action can feel a bit too fake at times yet nearly all these stunts were pulled off without CGI especially when he sends a car into a helicopter. Yet despite people being shot there is hardly any blood which can kick reality out the window.The story is pretty good and pretty relative to post 9/11 action films or TV series like 24. It's all about terrorism and villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) being the best computer programmer of all time hacks into every system that depends on the US government. This cause chaos and havoc in Washington DC meaning people are running around like headless chickens wondering what is happening and means attempting to kill a few hackers to stop them from stopping the cyber-terrorism such as Matt Ferrell (Justin Long.) Except he fails to kill Matt as John McClane saves his life. This gives us a great partnership for the rest of the film creating wit during the non-action scenes for example Matt taking the mickey of McClane's lack of technological knowledge and good teamwork with McClane taking the mickey of Matt's lack of knowledge on how to handle himself in a gun fight. With Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Lucy McClane being as mentally strong as her dad these three good guys make a very good team.Unfortunately the bad guys are less impressive as Maggie Q's Mai seemed stronger than the main bad guy that I nearly thought she was a character cross-breed from House of Flying Daggers and The Matrix which for a full throttle no holds barred film such as Die Hard 4.0 it is a tad bit silly. Timothy Olyphant did act his role well but he wasn't sinister enough or scary enough to be a memorable bad guy unlike Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber in the original Die Hard or else wouldn't the character of Lucy McClane be scared of him. The only other bad thing is that his legendary quote, 'yippee-ki-yay motherf****r' is cut off by a gunshot.If it wasn't the use of the s-word this could have been a 12A (it is a UK rating means under 12's can see as long as they are accompanied by an adult for people who live outside Britain.) as the lack of blood and the storyline appeals more to a young audience but not to worry for the fans of the original as the action is still pretty tense. Overall, director Len Wiseman has definitely proved that Bruce Willis has still got it to be John McClane as his hair is gone but his attitude certainly hasn't. Die Hard 4.0 is as good as the rest of the Die Hard series.",8,2,5,17 July 2007
The Simpsons Movie," About time!
","Since the show began back in 1989 it has been a phenomenal success launching itself to become one of the shows to watch in the 90s. Since then it took a dramatic dip for the worse with good episodes coming in few and far between. The movie was rumoured for ages since the show was at it's prime and finally these rumours have come true as it was confirmed in the summer of 2006 to be released in July/August the following year. So would it live up to the standard of the old episodes providing classics each and every week or would it fail and flop miserably like the newer episodes? It's a bit hit and miss I must say as it feels like a new episode but extended hugely with some old style jokes gone a tiny bit ruder than usual. For example when Bart skateboards down Springfield naked is very funny and Homer using film and book character names for his pet pig. However this happens early on the film where this was a lot better than the average expectations given by critics. From then on in the plot seems to fell like a new episode, past its prime, which is stupid. Long story short The Simpsons get expelled from Springfield as the town gets quarantined after Homer ultra-pollutes the town. Typical new Simpsons.Yet unlike a fresh episode of the series it seems funnier which gives an edge over the sceptics opinion in it being too silly. Yes it is silly but it ain't to the point of extreme, like the episodes where it based itself on bible stories or something crap like that. Unfortunately, for hardcore fans of the show characters like Moe, Mr. Burns or Apu seem to only have a part worth approximately a few seconds which is bad, because these characters seem like ordinary people except they are portrayed to be funny which is not like the Simpsons family who are different people which sometimes can be less hilarious. What is worse is that the characters added to the movie like that EPA guy who wants to destroy Springfield is unfunny.Overall there are some good parts and there are some bad parts to this film but nonetheless it is a good animated comedy, not to the standards of the classics but far better than the new episodes. Expect this film not to get the best animated film at the Oscars as it isn't good enough.",6,2,3,26 August 2007
