Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Masterful
","It has to be said that Quentin Tarantino quite simply rocks and is the epitome of cool in modern-day film-making. Nobody stamps their mark on a film in the manner he does and with the possible exception of the peerless 'Pulp Fiction' this is his finest work to date. Vol.2 is utterly absorbing. The loose ends and questions from Vol.1 are seamlessly threaded into the next passage of Beatrix's vengeful odyssey and flow perfectly through to a wonderfully crafted and satisfying denouement. Effortlessly stylish and original, the dialogue and characters come together with the plot to create what can only be described as a masterpiece of modern movie-making. Utterly, utterly brilliant; there is simply nothing more to say.",10,2,4,22 April 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Enjoyable caper
","'Catch Me If You Can' is a beautifully crafted caper from Spielberg. Featuring terrific performances from DiCaprio, Hanks and Walken the film exudes quality from start to finish. The depicted time period is captured and expressed to perfection: the sets, cars and clothes are a joy to behold at times and you find yourself genuinely lost in Frank Abagnale JR.'s world of deception. The lighting is wonderful, all sunlight streaming through windows and half closed curtains, giving the film a timeless, fairytale look, perhaps serving as a metaphor for the make believe world of young Frank as he impersonates both a doctor and an airline pilot whilst conning America's banks out of millions of dollars through bogus cheques, all before his 18th birthday. The characters are fleshed out extremely well and the reasons behind Frank's descent into a life of crime are carefully illustrated and conscientiously referred to throughout the movie. I highly recommend 'Catch Me If You Can' as it is refreshing, well made and absorbing.",7,1,3,21 March 2005
Oldboy," Striking
","Having heard good things from a friend of mine and noting it's current lofty position in the top 250 coupled with several interesting good and bad reviews, 'Oldboy' intrigued me both with it's premise and Korean origins. I subsequently obtained the newly released 2-disc special edition and settled in to watch, not entirely sure what to expect. In short I was blown away. Having only recently become acquainted with this wonderful site (iMDB) and having resolved to sharpen my cinematic knowledge and radar I couldn't have hoped for a better starting point. Striking visual content, strong performances and a wonderful score are to name but a few of the film's qualities. As I said, I was blown away. The central character is Oh-Dae Su, randomly and mysteriously abducted and incarcerated against his will for 15 years in a makeshift 'prison' resembling a dilapidated motel. The central theme of the picture transpires that it's not who is responsible for this, but why they did it to him and how he proceeds to uncover this with the 'help' of both his nemesis Lee Woo-Jin and new love, Mi-Do. As the story unravels and moves towards it's conclusion the film reveals itself to be a dark, twisted, enigmatic masterpiece. The colour scheme throughout the film renders it almost cartoonish in style: both vivid and dull greens, purples and reds form the common thread and each come to symbolise different things. This and also effective use of contrast and imagery (the film's opening shot is that of Dae-Su's clenched fist grasping the straining tie of a suicidal businessman) combine to at times mesmerising effect. Little touches, like the opening credits collapsing as if the hands of a clock to show that a pivotal aspect of the movie is the passage of time are scattered throughout the film, rendering it on a base level a visual feast of impressive proportions. I personally found the plot and it's twists refreshingly original. Unexpected, shocking and unlike anything i've encountered before. Certainly the final revelation in the penthouse as Lee Woo-Jin illustrates visually his shocking final revenge on Dae-Su, 15 years in the making, followed by Dae-Su's symbolic, self-inflicted penance took my breath away. This film provided a wonderful, startling insight into what world and particularly Asian cinema has to offer and that to me makes 'Oldboy' a seminal work and one that will linger on in the memory.",8,11,119,18 March 2005
Hotel Rwanda," Awareness
","Having heard excellent things about this film I finally had the opportunity last night to see it before it left the cinemas here. I thought it was fantastic, extremely moving and well made. Don Cheadle excels in the lead role. The pacing and tension in the film is fantastic as Cheadle gradually takes on the role of protector for the Tutsi refugees, pleading and bargaining for their safety through his various connections forged as the manager of the luxurious Milles Des Collines hotel. His torn allegiance between his immediate family and the refugees he houses is at times both difficult and fascinating to watch. The ambush by Hutu rebels on the UN convoy with Cheadle's family on board is simply heart-stopping film at it's very best. Also the river road and Joaquin Phoenix's shame at being escorted to safety by the man with the umbrella are two of many unforgettable moments. The film opened my eyes to a wider world and I now feel ashamed of my relative ignorance and, more importantly, indifference to world events. It's true that I alone cannot make a difference but if more people are aware of incidents such as the one depicted to such breathtaking effect in this film then maybe in future people won't be left behind. Whoever, if anyone, reads this post, please either go or urge people to go and see this film. It is relevant in so many ways and it opened my eyes to problems so much bigger than working late and traffic jams.",10,1,1,16 March 2005
Lost in Translation," Refreshingly Different
","'Lost In Translation' is a novel movie experience. With it's languid pace, soft focus and sparse dialogue it possesses an almost dream-like quality. Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansson hold your attention as two disparate, lonely strangers in a foreign land (Tokyo itself is effectively a central character) who seek solace in each other's company to escape their self-imposed exiles at the Park Hyatt hotel. Murray, an international movie star, is on location filming a whisky commercial whilst Johansson is accompanying her photographer husband (a quirky Giovanni Ribisi) on a business trip. The film charts their burgeoning friendship forged through a mutual apathy borne out of loneliness and frustration. They talk, drink, sing karaoke and hang out in the hotel bar. 'Lost In Translation' is a film about finding both friendship and inspiration in the most unlikely of places. The fact that the central characters find understanding in such a foreign place demonstrates this to perfection with Tokyo proving an inspired location for a movie about finding meaning. In fact you could say it's wholly ironic. A clever and subtle film which rails refreshingly against convention, making Sofia Coppola clearly one to watch as a director.",9,0,1,7 April 2005
The Green Mile," Moving
","'The Green Mile' is an unforgettable film. It is by turn moving, inspiring, magical and uplifting. Written and directed by Frank Darabont of Shawshank Redemption fame it tells a tale of prison life in Louisiana in the thirties and the experiences of a set of inmates and guards on death row there, commonly known as 'The Green Mile' due to the colour of it's linoleum floor. Based on a story by Stephen King, the main thread of the film concerns a new inmate on the mile, John Coffey ('like the drink just not spelt the same'), who is facing the electric chair on account of his murdering two young sisters. It soon becomes clear there is more to Coffey (a breathtaking turn by Michael Clarke Duncan) than meets the eye and he takes centre stage in this expertly crafted, layered tale of compassion, friendship and loss. Along with 'Hotel Rwanda' this is possibly the most emotional film I have seen and as you follow the paths of the condemned inmates to their final reckonings you will find yourself on several occasions moved nearly to tears. The cast as a whole produce stellar, career best performances (even Tom Hanks) and the character development and pacing of the film is wonderful. I'm a big fan of 'The Shawshank Redemption' but for sheer raw emotion you will probably never see a better film than 'The Green Mile'.",10,0,1,6 April 2005
