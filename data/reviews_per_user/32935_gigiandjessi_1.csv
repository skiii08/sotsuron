Come and See," Casualties of War
","This is a devastating film about the realities of war. Set in 1943, Byelorussia, we meet Florya (Aleksey Kravchenko) who at the ripe age of 14 is prepared to become a hero for his country. His mother begs him to stay, yet her cries fall on deaf ears. Florya is determined to fight at all cost. What follows are a series of events that are shocking to the senses in every possible way.A heartbreaking scene is when Florya returns home in search of his family, in hopes of sharing a warm meal only to find a barren cabin. We are at once aware of his naivet√® when he is convinced he knows where they are hiding. Which leads us to another grueling picture that only Glasha (Olga Mironova) and we, the audience are privy to. Our worst fear is revealed to us as we see, and almost smell corpses lying on top of one another, left there by the Nazis to rot.Another image that will stay with me for life is where Florya and Glasha are trudging through a thick, disgusting muddy swamp, that seems to swallow them up like quick sand. I felt as if I was there sinking, fighting for my life alongside them. Still they make it to the other side only to find more tragedy. Klimov, doesn't skip a beat in creating a full body experience for his viewers, and to further add to the intensity, there is a haunting soundtrack howling throughout the film that cuts through you. Sensory overload to say the least. Despite the many close encounters with death Florya escapes every time, or does he? It's hard to imagine what his life will be like after witnessing the mass genocide committed by the Nazis. One can't help but wonder if he wouldn't be better off dead. Not having to live with the brokenness and painful memories brought on by this atrocious war.It is my hope that many will be exposed to this film, that their eyes too will be opened to the harsh reality that is war.",10,3,3,11 February 2011
