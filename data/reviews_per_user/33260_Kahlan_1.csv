The Blair Witch Project," My Humble opinion
","OK, I've just come back from the cinema. This is my immediate opinion of The Blair Witch Project'.Some said it was the most terrifying film ever and others said it was the biggest load of rubbish.  While not the scariest film ever, it does make you think. Myself and 7 friends (all girls aged 16-18) went to see it. The film has been hyped up so much I honestly was not expecting much, something along the lines of a low budget Scream' set in the forest (I was not impressed with Scream'). Or this generations The Exorcist', a film which, in my opinion, is laughable (I did laugh when I saw it). But I must admit that I was quite mistaken.While watching the film you're not that scared. True there are some tense moments, the part where they're in the tent and it's like someone's pushing at it from the outside while there are crying noises, or when they wake up and find the 3 mounds of stones around the tent. Or how about those little stick figures strewn all over the place? And the children's hand prints on the wall of the ruined house. OK, there are more than just a few tense moments.There were times when all I wanted to do was shout at them for being so stupid. Heather found Joshua's nose, teeth, and eyes, and yet she still chased after his voice! And then there was when herself and Mike found the house, how could they have let themselves get separated? If that was me I would have been clinging to him for dear life!The final few minutes are a blur, the cameras are shaky and the images unclear. When she runs into the basement It's unreal! When the film was over the whole audience just sat there, waiting. One person exclaimed What? It can't be over!', while others sighed in relief. Everyone was waiting for more. What a brilliant way to end a film! It leaves you free to draw your own conclusions, which is scarier that any special effects or gory images could ever be. The things 5 of us came up with in the car home were just chilling, and I'm not the type of person who is easily disturbed.The acting is amazing. I can see how American audiences believed it was true. When they try and leave the forest and end up walking in a circle Heather's  words cut through me like a spear: It's not the same log. It's not the same log. It's not the same log It's the same log It's the same log.' How could someone act out that fear? But what I think affected most people was the scene when Heather has the camera on herself and she's apologising for causing their deaths: It's all my fault.' Everyone one I spoke to could not help but stare at her tears.I strongly recommend that this film should be watched in company, just so you have someone to walk home with! Especially if you have an overactive imagination. Or any imagination at all! It's by far the best film out at the moment, and one of the best I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot).The Blair Witch Project': don't believe what other people have said about it - see it for yourself.",Null,0,1,6 November 1999
