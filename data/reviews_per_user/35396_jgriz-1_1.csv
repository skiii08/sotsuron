Miracle," Do you Believe in miracles?????
","The 1980 Olympic hockey team of the United states is one of the most inspirational David and Glioth stories that I have ever heard of. I was not yet born when the Soveits fell to the younger, less experienced, less talented team from America. Inspite of this, I am a sports fan and of course I knew the team the would win, but this movie flat out captured just about everything it could have. Great acting I don't know who played Ralph Cox, or basically anybody except Herd Brooks, but all the way through the acting was impeccable, great setups, excellent atmosphere in the prelim game against Sweeden I think it was, I know the squad was going to win, but I was still nervous that the team was going to lose and be eliminated, then the tieing goal came, basically thats how the whole movie is, edge of you're seat action and all the elements to be a potential top 10 film on anybodys list and an instant classic.",9,0,0,22 September 2006
