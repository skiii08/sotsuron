Blade Runner 2049," Don't watch this film watch the original Blade runner
","It seemed almost perfect with 3 actors reprising thier roles and Denis Villeneuve directing. I was more hyped for this film than any movie in 2017, and when I saw the reviews I thought it would be great, too bad I was wrong. In its overlong run time it doesn't even come close to capturing the experience of watching the original blade runner.The visuals aren't half bad but the thing is that you don't need to make a sequel to an already perfect film. The movie is a cinematic achievement on its own right with good casting and practical effects but as a sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time it doesn't hold up. The score is not even near as good as the original either and on the philosophical side it doesn't present any new ideas that the first blade runner didn't have already. As a whole I would say don't watch it, if you're a blade runner fan you'll be disappointed, if not you'll wonder what the heck you just watched.",3,21,46,7 October 2017
