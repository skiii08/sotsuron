The Blair Witch Project," Toooo bad!!
","I loved this movie! Problem is that I have a bad time knowing that this movie, is nothing but a adaptation of the swedish movie made a few years ago titled 'Det ukjente' (The Unknown). Blair Witch project ain't half as scary as the original swedish flick, and that's to bad. People seems to think that this is a work of art by the creators of Blair Witch Project, while the few of us know that this flick was actually created by the brains of two swedish brains. The fact is that the original swedish version is far more scarier, than Blair Witch Project. Hopefully, the swedish version will eventually be released in the US. That way people can get really scared. It's to bad that the Blair Witch project got to be so popular. The Uknown is the real deal, and far more scarier!",Null,0,1,8 March 2002
