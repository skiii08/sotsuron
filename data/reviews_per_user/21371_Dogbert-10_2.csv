Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Fans just don't get it...
","In my opinion, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace did its job of creating new worlds for the audience to explore and telling us the backstory to a legendary epic.  It was no less and no more.  Many people cite character development as the Achilles heel of this movie.  They compare it to the original trilogy of how Luke, Leia and Han go through character changes.  Well, the character development of Episodes 4,5,6 cannot be done in one movie.  And, Lucas didn't feel obligated to make Qui-Gon, Obi, and Amidala go through the same character development as Luke, Han, and Leia did in Episode 4.  Lucas has the promise of developing his characters in Episodes 2 and 3 while Episodes 5 and 6 was not guaranteed after making the initial Star Wars movie.  Most 'fans' went in with a cookie-cutter view of what the Phantom Menace should've been.  And it didn't fit.  I went in to have fun in the adventure, and I did!  In fact, the second time was even better than the first!  Legends weren't made in a day and the greatness of The Phantom Menace won't be realized for years to come.  Star Wars is still continuing to pave the way for better filmmaking--maybe not necessarily better screenwriting.  That was never Lucas' strong point.  Although I hope Lucas can hire a screenwriter, such as Lawrence Kasdan, in the future, The Phantom Menace did its job in giving us an action-packed, visual masterpiece while not pretending to be an Academy-award winner by any means.  I give it ***1/2.  There's room for improvement, but it is one of the only movies in recent memory where it delivered the goods that it promised.  They never promised Oscar-winning dialogue or deep character development.  So, put away your cookie cutters and lighten up!  And who cares if it never beats Titanic...as if dollars signs symbolized validity.",8,0,0,21 May 1999
Meet the Parents," For anyone who is married...
","I got to watch an advance screening of this movie and I was expecting a so-so picture.  What I got was the best comedy I've seen in the theatre since I saw Bowfinger!  More recently, Nurse Betty was also very good, but Meet The Parents is just plain hilarious.I guess it was extra special to me because I saw it with a couple one year away from a wedding and when i saw it, I was about one week away from being the best man in another friend's wedding.With Mystery Men and now Meet The Parents, I think Ben Stiller has legitimized his comic acting.  DeNiro was also brilliant playing a somewhat eccentric father.The movie starts out slow, but in no time when the ball got rolling, the laughs kept on coming!Definitely the best comedy this year and probably the late 90's.",Null,0,0,1 October 2000
