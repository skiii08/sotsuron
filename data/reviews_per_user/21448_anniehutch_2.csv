The New World," A Beautiful Film
","I loved watching this movie. The scenery was amazing! I'm a little bias since some of the movie was shot in and near my home town of Virginia Beach. It's breathtaking, but certainly isn't for people who like movies that have a lot of talking and action. This is a movie for people who like to sit down and enjoy beauty. It's really more of an emotionally driven movie, with the dialogue as an accessory to the story, not the driving force. I loved the way Virginia was shown. It really is a beautiful state. And, of course, everyone knows the story, but to see it again was lovely. I heard a lot of negative things about this movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only criticism I have is that it did drag in some parts. It's a slow paced movie, but it's not too bad. Because of the dragging, I'm only giving it 9 out of 10 stars.",9,1,3,4 March 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Wonderful and fascinating.
","I enjoyed this movie to no end. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it would be an OK movie, so I didn't see it. When it came out on DVD, I bought it on a whim and I am very grateful to that whim.This movie is very inventive on it's take on really living life. When I watched it, it made me appreciate the quirkiness of my own life. It makes you think about how mundane an existence can be and that you shouldn't start to live life after you find out you're going to die. It's deep, but whimsical. It has humor and disguised serious undertones.I have to say, Will Ferrel surprised me. Most of the time he's playing a mindless character that will do anything for humor and he can be very funny, but other times he can just be crude. This was a wonderful departure for him. I was impressed and look forward to other movies from him.The performances were stellar, especially from Will Ferrel, Emma Thompson, and Dustin Hoffman. It's a wonderful movies that makes you laugh and think.",8,1,2,20 June 2007
