First Man," So realistic made it turns boring
","Its not enough to make a movie that is true to where the story takes place in the history of time. It also has to capture the viewer. This is absolutely not the case here. You get a lot of fragments and small clips with men smoking cigarets, talking and discussing things, numbers being mentioned and spacecraft expressions being said out loud - things that you dont understand unless you are a spacecraft ingenier. There are clips with a child and a woman in various situations at home while daddy is up in space - all made to look like a documentary - which is all fine - if only it would capture the viewer. But it just dont. Instead it seperates the viewer from the story beeing told making it boring to be frank - which is quite impressiv in a way when you think of the fact that this is a movie about one of the biggest achievements in mankind - The first man on the moon",3,1,6,1 June 2019
Peaceful Warrior," Magnificent - This one will change your view on life forever!
","This rare movie is one of those very, very few that could change your life - forever. It is a movie, that tells the story of the fear of failure and inner emptiness we all encounter in life - but it also tells the story of a hidden treasure within - if we just dare to look inside - we will find it. Go on a journey that will transform - not only your view on life - but the view of WHO YOU Truly ARE!Look closer, look within!",10,0,1,26 June 2017
Whiplash," A masterpiece - Straight up!
","Just do yourself a favour - watch this movie! Its both fascinating, surprising and chocking - made with a lot of charm and wit! A masterpiece - Straight up!",10,0,0,14 July 2018
Mother!," Like watching someone throw up - over and over again!
","This movie certainly is weak on almost every level. Even if you judge Mother in its genre it is weak. Whats the point of dwelling into all this violence, death, screaming and pain? You could certainly tell the story line with much more wit and elegancy - and reach a much broader audience. No way I will recomend this movie. Life simply is to beautiful and grand to waste time on a movie? like this. Its like watching someone throw up. Over and over againIf you truely like this type of movie I recomend masterpieces like 'Lost Highway' or 'Birdman' instead - or Aronofskys own masterpieces like 'Requiem for a dream', 'The Wrestler' and last but not least 'Black Swan'",1,2,5,9 July 2018
