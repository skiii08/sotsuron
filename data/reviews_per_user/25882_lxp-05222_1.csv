Hereditary," Horrible
","My brother, best friend, and mother all got kicked out of the movie because we could not stop laughing. A majority of these actors in this movie do absolutely amazing jobs on other roles. But this one is humiliating for their careers. Tons of plot holes and the ending was absolutely horrible. Waste of money",1,10,23,11 June 2018
