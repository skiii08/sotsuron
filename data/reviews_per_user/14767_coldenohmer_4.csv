10 Cloverfield Lane," Almost perfect
","Much better than the first movie. The first movie is still fun, but this one just can't compare. John Goodman's performance is easily the best part of this movie and totally got missed during the Oscar season.
I can't recommend this more. Very scary and well acted film. I recommend this to anyone.",8,0,0,4 May 2020
Bird Box," The most overrated movie EVER.
",I can't recommend this movie the concept is stupid. The characters are annoying. Don't watch it's a big waste of time,3,7,9,4 May 2020
Sinister," This movie broke me
",If you want to be scared for a whole week you you should watch.,8,0,2,7 May 2020
Joker," Easily the most disturbing superhero movie ever
","When I first watched this I felt like I was about to throw up, I can't even fully describe how I felt. A movie had never effected me like that before. I recommend this movie to anyone.",10,0,1,5 May 2020
