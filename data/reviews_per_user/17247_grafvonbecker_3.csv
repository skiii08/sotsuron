Come and See," One of the greatest movies I ever seen
","First of all: this is not a piece of propaganda, at least no more than thousands of bad popcorn-American-hero-films of Hollywood.Second: this movie isn't for the faint-hearted; the film includes several scenes of tension and incredible well done FX, and scenes where the most crude human nature emerges to mesmerize us.I find myself empathizing with the main character, Flyora, after the first half hour (by the way, the movie starts in a strange way for the western audience, but don't be fooled; soon the movie starts to make you revolve around your chair); this movie manages very well to show you the real life of a peasant boy in the Soviet Union, the trivial and the transcendental moments as seen by the young, both Flyora and Glasha. Scenes of tenderness and sadism are well blended.There is no caricatures, not for the soviets, not for the Nazis. There is no 'we are the best army in the world' message (as many American films do), but a delicate patriotic message.If you want to spend two hours watching something unusual but yet very touching, please watch this piece. You will not be disappointed.",9,2,3,8 August 2015
Aliens," Best movie ever. Period.
","I still remember the first time I saw this movie; I was 14 and, after watching the original cut, I had to applaud. Alone.James Cameron did an excellent job here. Not only excellent; I like to think that this movie set a milestone for both the sci-fi and the action genres.Aliens is a movie about monsters, about our future as humans, about love, about the human nature. It have its own philosophy. Are the xenomorphs the only bad guys in this story? I like the way Ripley fills the void of her daughter with Newt, and how she endures herself during the movie.*** SPOILERS *** The only thing I don't like is the way the original version was edited: it left out some memorable scenes: the discovery of the derelict by Newt's family, and the sentry weapons in the hallways. Both of them adds tension and drama to the movie, and explains some obscure points in the original version.*** END OF SPOILERS *** If you didn't watch it yet, do it! Is one of the best movies ever, and deserves to share the glory with Shawshank Redemption and The Godfather.",10,0,4,6 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Stop saying this is Tolkien; this isn't Tolkien at all!
","This is one of the worst movies I ever seen. Yes, the former was a cliché phrase, but it goes very well with a movie full of them.*** SPOILERS ***First of all, who the hell is Tauriel? Where in all the Tolkien mithos is that unnecessary character? And why Tauriel gets more screen time than Bilbo? Damn, Jackson! Second, the extreme overuse of (bad) CGI. Sometimes seems that the orcs are just a mediocre 3D model with a poor AI in a bad video game. Sometimes they seems to have been copied and pasted by the hundreds. Where are the details, Peter? Third: the plot is simply awful. There is a lot of clichés, stupid Matrix-like action scenes and, worst of all, the forced love story between Kili and Tauriel. Again, who the hell is Tauriel? Fourth: Where is Beorn in this movie? One of the main characters in the book gives here fifteen seconds and no more, while 'Tauriel' gives hours.Fifth: What happened with the treasure, with all the gold? What happened with the people at the lake? Sixth: the goats. Why? The PIG. Can you believe it? A damn PIG in the middle of the battle.*** END OF SPOILERS ***I can write hours and hours about how awful this movie is. Even when I watch it keeping in mind that this isn't an accurate adaptation. But you have the idea.My advice? Don't waste your money. Read the book. Again if necessary.",1,58,103,6 January 2015
