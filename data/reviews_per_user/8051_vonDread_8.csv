The Ring," Ringu did it better, and without the Hollywood excess.
","Spoilers maybe.I saw the original Ringu first, so there's no way I can talk about the remake without comparing the two. I really did enjoy the remake, particularly Naomi Watts' performance, but I do think the original is marginally better. In both versions, the tension is extremely tangible and builds slowly, the atmosphere is equally creepy, but the original isn't riddled with Scary PartsT designed to make you jump, which American horror movies just can't seem to leave out. I appreciated that, and because of it, the ending was more effective in the original. Not to mention during the end sequence they didn't need to (but probably didn't have the budget to anyway) use digital effects to make it look 'cool'.Seriously, the ending of the original is much more well done. And much creepier. As so many great foreign and independent movies have proven, a bigger budget does not necessarily equal a better movie. With a low budget, the movie's not going to be clogged with pointless special effects and filler, but instead concentrate more on telling a story. In that respect, Ringu succeeded marvelously. The remake did as well, it just did it flashier. It tired to impressive its audience with eye candy, instead of just letting this great story tell itself.Also, the video tape sequence is better in the original. When a movie gets Americanized, I always dread what invariably happens--it overexplains things. Such is the case here. I completely got the all the elements of the story in the original, even if the video tape didn't make sense. In the remake, they just felt the need to explain everything, severely detracting from the supernatural mystique of the story (which is at its heart, a traditional ghost story--the best kind of horror story). The original doesn't need to beat you over the head to get your attention, particularly in the case of the subliminal reference to the title, and I appreciate that as well.The remake definitely has better actors going for it, but I don't think it stands up quite as well. Whichever version you see first will probably have the scarier ending though, and thus may appear a consistently better film. I'd give the original 8/10, and the remake 7/10.",7,0,0,10 December 2002
X-Men," I feel vindicated.
","This ranks up there among the greatest comic book movies ever made. Thank you Bryan Singer. Thank you David Hayter. Thank you Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, and Hugh Jackman. And most of all, thank you Ray Park. In my eyes, you guys have done a fair bit to redeem the genre. Fans of the comic will probably find this a lot more satisfying than non-readers, though it's a pretty enjoyable movie regardless.  Hugh Jackman is incredible. He simply is Wolverine. I'm so glad they chose not to cast an established movie star in the role. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are great as always, though the fanboy in me wants to have words with the wardrobe department about how silly Magneto's helmet looks. The biggest surprise by far is Toad. Ray Park breathes life into the pathetic little troll, turning him into an exciting, dangerous, and formidable X-Villain, even paying homage to his Darth Maul role for a moment. Magneto's lackey no more, he was beyond a doubt my favorite character in the movie. I'd only venture some minor critiques. Firstly, we all know how  that one line of Storm's is. You know the one I mean. It's not Halle's fault entirely I guess, but it still makes me cringe every time I hear it. And Storm's character wasn't nearly developed enough in the first place. Then there's Magneto's plan. Though it does make sense and provides an interesting plot, it's just not his style. Genetic-engineering and DNA manipulation is Mr. Sinister's bag. Other than that, it's all good. 8/10.",8,0,1,10 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Brilliant adaptation.
","I don't think many people realize how lucky we are to have had such a brilliant and imaginative writer share his astoundingly detailed, rich, and colorful fantasy epic with the world. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings for his grandchildren, but if it wasn't for him the fantasy genre as we know it today would not exist. Everything that followed The Lord of the Rings borrowed from it in one way or another. Dungeons & Dragons, Star Wars, Final Fantasy, and Harry Potter, among countless other fantasy worlds, wouldn't be around if The Lord of the Rings was never published. We owe Tolkien a great debt of gratitude. Everything, from the expansive and awe-inspiring natural surroundings of New Zealand, to Sir Ian McKellan's triumphant and thoroughly entertaining portrayal of Gandalf the Grey, contributes to make The Fellowship of the Ring a film for the ages, a wonderful tribute to Tolkien's masterful vision. Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, Best Original Score, Best Director (Peter Jackson), Best Picture of the Year. 9/10.",9,0,0,10 December 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Okay, we get it. Tom Cruise is 'cool'.
","Spectacular belief-defying stunts... and not much else. Apparently not many people fully grasped the plot of the first installment (a much better movie), so its sequel was dumbed down to a generic summer action flick. And isn't MI supposed to be about a team of covert agents? That's what I remember when I used to watch the show as a kid. So where's the team? All I saw was a movie about how 'cool' Tom Cruise was supposed to be. I used to admire John Woo; he's a better director with a smaller budget and no big-name American movie stars. 2/10.",5,1,3,10 December 2002
Enemy at the Gates," Not really a war masterpiece.
","Maybe there's something nostalgic about Russians and German characters not speaking with their proper accents in war movies, because that's how a lot of war movies used to be made, but it's something that just gets on my nerves. The opening battle scenes are on par with Saving Private Ryan, the tension of the two snipers' duel is nail-biting, but the love triangle subplot is forgettable, and the filmmakers fail to utilize and comment on the propaganda used by both the Soviets and Germans in any meaningful way. The movie does get points for showcasing the Eastern front of the European theater. Hollywood would have us believe the US won the war single-handedly, but the Russians were in fact instrumental in the defeat of the Nazis. Still, I just can't get past those Russians with British accents. 6/10.If you'd like to see movies that highlight the Eastern front even more effectively, check out Sam Peckinpah's Cross of Iron from 1977, or the German-made Stalingrad from 1993.",7,1,3,10 December 2002
Signs," Shyamalan is one ignorant person
","If he thinks that's how and why people become atheists anyway.  I think the man is shaping up to be a great director.  His two previous efforts rank among my favorite movies ever.  But I couldn't help but be offended by Signs.Visually, the movie is stunning.  Very suspenseful as well, and in that respect I applaud Shyamalan's work.  He's the next Alfred Hitchcock.  But I just couldn't get past the religious BS this movie is riddled with.Someday, someone's going to write an intelligent script about a character losing their faith, and nobody's ever going to see it made into a film because from the tripe we've seen in recent years (ie. Bless the Child, End of Days, etc.), filmmakers believe us godless heathens could never be heroes.  Everybody triumphs in the end if they just have faith.  Excuse me, I need a barf bag.",4,1,1,23 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Escapist Entertainment for the Ages
","One of the most revolutionary movies ever made. It's not often Hollywood has to invent new technology and techniques to film a movie. I can still remember seeing it as a kid on my parents' tiny little black and white TV when it aired on CBC. Even then it was one of the coolest things I'd ever seen. And it stands the test of time. The opening sequence from the 20th Century Fox fanfare to the Corellian Corvette being pursued relentlessly by Vader's dreaded Star Destroyer is now one of the most memorable in the history of film, and it still gives me chills every time I see it (upwards of fifty by now I'm sure--I think the only movie I've seen more is Batman). Though Lucas did borrow a lot from The Lord of the Rings, The Wizard of Oz, and Akira Kurosawa's movies, he blended them together in a really unique way, along with the tried and true elements that made westerns and Saturday afternoon serials so popular. At its core, Star Wars is just a fun adventure movie. It wasn't made to win Oscars, but to simply entertain. And it does that like not many other films can.  Out of the original trilogy, this was by far the most improved upon with the release of its Special Edition. Though the extra scene with Han Solo and Jabba the Hutt was completely unnecessary, and of course Greedo shooting first ranks up there with Jar Jar Binks as one of the worst ideas Lucas ever conceived, the movie as a whole seems so much more alive and enjoyable to watch. Too bad the same can't be said for the other two movies' Special Editions. What happened? It's like they stopped trying once they got to Jedi; it's barely improved at all. The Rancor scene still looks horrible. Guess they spent too much money on that slappy-ass musical number. Anyway, I give the original Star Wars 9/10.",10,0,0,10 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Time for the bad guys to shine.
","I've always thought the bad guys were the coolest. The Empire Strikes Back is perfect. The introduction of the Super Star Destroyer is my favorite scene of any Star Wars movie. It still gives me chills every time. A great character--Boba Fett--was originally introduced in Empire. The saber duel between Luke and Vader remains my favorite in the series. While the duel in The Phantom Menace is probably the most visually dazzling and awe-inspiring, it's far too short, and there's no motive or emotion involved. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fight Maul based only on the fact he poses an immediate threat, and it's their duty to combat evil. Luke goes up against Vader because the Force guides him to it. He's destined to confront the Dark Lord and learn the truth about his father. The ending of Empire is the most dramatic of the series without a doubt. It's the only one of the bunch that doesn't end on a happy note, like a fairy tale. 10/10.",10,0,1,10 December 2002
