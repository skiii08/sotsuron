The Blair Witch Project," I honestly walked out of the theater pale as a ghost and trembling like a leaf.
","This is not only one of the horrifying films I've ever seen, sitting in the theater that night was one of the most frightening experiences of my life. This film is so convincing, after an advanced screening, I over heard a woman say to her husband 'My God, why didn't we hear about this on the news?' A film has never had such a strong impact on me. The directors and the stars of this picture deserve their places in history. I expect that this film will go down as one of the best ever made.",Null,1,2,22 June 1999
