Hereditary," Scary but Confusing
","Saw this movie the other day and honestly didn't get at first,I hadn't read the book but found the movie very interesting.The movie was very off track and would leave a character behind and never really mention them again after explaining about them for 30 freaking minutes.The movie wouldn't tell you what's going on and I ended up having ask someone what just the hell was going on.But it was a good movie and I would recommend it for fans of horror and of the book.",9,3,9,10 June 2018
X-Men," Spoiler but question
","What was supposed to be the love story behind this it was like a love triangle ( not that it was a romance story) But,I didn't understand who liked who.But that doesn't matter it was a pretty decent movie overall besides,their making a new one in 2019 along with the other great stuff coming out that year.So I guess I could fastforward 20 years worth of X-men because why the hell not?",8,0,0,15 June 2018
Ready Player One," It brought Pop-Culture Movies back to life
",This movie was fantastic with another hit made by Steven Spielberg. It brought back the 80s and 90s films and games along with some new stuff.It was actually one of my favorite movies ever because of all of the references.THE MOVIE LITERALLY GAVE ME CHILLS!!,10,10,22,14 June 2018
Now You See Me," Breathtaking
","The movie actually at points left me speechless and was really interesting to watch but, this is coming from someone who was obsessed with magic as a child.Don't listen to all the other reviews saying 'it was terrible!' because they probably don't watch as much sci-fi and don't understand that their doesn't half to be Science behind everything that's why it's called science FICTION.Seriously the best movie ever and I'm so glad they made a sequel.",10,0,1,21 June 2018
Avengers: Endgame," I love it 3000
","Any Marvel fan would enjoy the movie no problem but having a sister who doesn't enjoy most movies and getting her to cry to a movie she doesn't know much about now that, that is an accomplishment my friend.The movie is literally for everyone all you have to do is have a little context and you'll fall in love with all the characters and you'll end up being back to their beginning listening to their story and becoming a true fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",10,0,2,1 May 2019
Friends with Benefits," Literally a big mood and so incredibly true
",The movie was hilarious and it made since 100% of the time.They were saying things that were really relatable and Woody Harleson even topped it off with a gay comedy performance (which was the best by the way.) seriously really recommend this movie.,10,0,0,30 July 2018
Die Hard," MAXIMUM ACTION INCLUDED
","Does anyone remember when Chandler and Joey from 'Friends' would always watch 'Die Hard' because it was their favorite action movie of all time,well they weren't joking it's seriously so much action you want to become the person in the movie.",10,1,2,25 July 2018
Whiplash," I used to be a drummer but then I stopped.This movie made me want to be a drummer again.
","This movie is a fantastic story based off of a short film made a while before the movie came out.The movie is fast paced, musical, and unintentionally funny for some viewers like myself. I found the film very dramatic and found myself really feeling and sweating for the character. Though, the characters cussed in scenes so much to the point where it was kind of unrealistic, I thought it was absolutely fantastic and I'd even consider it on my list of favorites.",10,0,0,15 September 2019
