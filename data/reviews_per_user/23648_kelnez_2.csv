The Blair Witch Project," Most inventive way of telling a story I've ever seen.
","I was shocked when the mostly adolescent audience booed at the conclusion of this film.  But then, maybe I shouldn't have been shocked as teens rarely appreciate innovativeness.  If you like your stories wrapped up and concluded for you, then don't see this movie.I found that the mode of filming created the fear it intended.  I found the acting to be excellent.  I loved this movie.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Impossible to live up to expectations (as is everything else in life)...but excellent movie nonetheless.
","What most people tend to forget is that they were children when they saw the first trilogy.  As children, we tend to be more impressionable.  Who hasn't, when recollecting their youth, realized that things just don't seem as 'neat' as they did when they were kids?  Such is the case w/Episode I. Our memory of the thrill Star Wars created in us as children is impossible to recapture once we've become adults.  Episode I is an excellent movie.  The plot is as entertaining as the originals.  The acting is better.  The special effects are better.  Don't listen to critics...this flick is worth it.  Don't even try to compare it to Episodes IV-VI.  Enjoy this movie for what it is...an excellently told tale that begins weaving the web that unfolds in the later trilogy.",10,0,0,9 June 1999
