Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat! VERY NICE
","This is easily the funniest film I have seen since the 1st Austin Powers movie. I am talking laugh for laugh. My eyes were watering at about the 10 minute mark with laughter, and did not stop until the credits at the end started to roll.Forget all that crap about Anti-Semitism, and cruel humor. The people saying this have no sense of humor and do not get the joke here. This movie shows just how stupid stereo-types and prejudice are in this day and age.I promise to spare you spoilers, but this movie delivers everything it promises and more. It's crude, obnoxious, vulgar, but the humor is smart and Cohen is a comic genius that can improvise so fast it's almost unreal.Easily some of the best gags ever put on film and looking back on seeing it over 24 hours ago, I amazed at the daring attitude this guy has. Brilliant comic styling's, Sasha Baron Cohen has created a character that will be hard to forget anytime soon. Rumors of a sequel must already being talked about, how can you pull this off at making 20 million I don't know. This will let filmmakers know that the R rated comedy is back and people are tired of watching the same lame estrogen laden, 'romantic comedies'. You can have your lake house, I'll hang with Borat.",10,2,16,6 November 2006
Transformers," My favorite movie of the summer and that says a lot
","What is easily the best non sequel movie of the summer. Transformers is the most action packed, fun thrill ride of a movie I have seen in many years. I saw an 11:40 pm screening of this movie at the Arclight Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, with a sold out crowd.This movie is better than I could have ever imagined. I have always enjoyed Bay's flair for flash and trash, this guy should have directed Miami Vice. He knows cars, and car chases better than anyone today. and this movie is no different. Action scenes so packed you have to see it again just to grasp it all. Great pacing between a national security storyline and a boy and his car, woven perfectly together.The movie is fun, over the top and funny in all the right places. Megan Fox is the resident hot chick and the entire movie plays to the inner teenager in all of us. My only regret is my 2 year old son is not old enough to view this with me.The first movie I'll be seeing a second time in the theater!best movies thus far:Transformers Die Hard 4 Knocked Up Pirates 3 Spidy 3",9,3,5,5 July 2007
Grindhouse," Rodriguez and Tarantino are firing on all cylinders with this one
","I have been waiting for Grindhouse for about 3 months now. Well today was the day I finally got to see it.I have to say this film is amazing. However it will not please casual film goers. This is not the kind of thing everyone will get or enjoy. This is for fans that LOVE the culture of film and cinema in all it's forms Even I am just a tad young to really appreciate what 70's Grindhouse pictures were, but after seeing Planet Terror it's hit all the points nicely. Bloody, funny, and very well done at not being well done. I really enjoyed the scratches and pops that came with it. Felt like I was at a revival house watching a print that was run over and over.What really pisses me off is everyone crapping all over 'Death Proof', Quentin Tarantino's, portion of the film. I thought the dialog, although was a bit wordy in parts, really added depth to the female characters. Keep in mind I disliked Kill Bill vol 2 for the reasons people don't think this. KB2 was wordy and pointless. Death Proof is paced just right to make you appreciate what is happening when it happens. It also helps that the entire 3rd act is one long (and totally AWESOME) car chase, and has ending that will satisfy even the most bitter of critics. What was lacking with Death Proof were the pops and scratches that made Planet Terror so fun. Death Proof was to clean. Which also brings up the fact this is a film to be seen in theaters, I am not sure it will be as fun at home on DVD.Both directors really showcased why they are to me the Spielberg and Lucas for a new generation, putting a twist on genre films that they loved growing up. Hats off to both Tarantino and Rodriguez I paid 10.75 to see this, and I have to say it was some of the best money I have spend at the theater in awhile. It took 30 minutes just to stop smiling. It was just a great time. I hated 300 and have been bored with a lot of other films lately. If you are a film fan round up the guys and check it out. If you are looking for something that is going to solve the worlds problems you'd better look elsewhere. Oh yeah make sure you go with the guys, most girls are going to care less about this one.",9,0,6,7 April 2007
The Departed," Scorsese proves why he's America's best living filmmaker
","Today I went to see a movie, I really didn't start hearing about until the past few weeks. While the internet has been the cause for much time away from my family, I never really seek out movie info, part of me still likes the surprise of seeing trailers at the theater, but I also have adopted a 'I'll see it when I believe it' attitude when it comes to movies in the works. I have other things to do than bad mouth movies that have not even come out yet... with that being said....I went to see the latest Martin Scorsese film 'The Departed'. First of all 'Goodfellas' is easily the top 2 of my favorite films of ALL TIME (right up there with 'Empire Strikes Back'). I have seen 'Goodfellas' easily over 20 times in it's entirety. I am in the camp that believes that Martin was robbed of the Oscar in 1990, by Kevin Costner and his 'Dances with Wolves'. Don't get me wrong 'Dances' was a good film, but I really think that for me it lacked the emotional journey and overall power that 'Goodfellas' had. GF is film-making at it's best and honestly 'The Departed' is like a breath of fresh air that's missing from so many big Hollywood films. Like many, I believe that Scorsese is arguably the best American director still alive today. Admitingly I was not a huge fan of the 'Avaitor', and while 'Gangs of New York' had it's flaws, it was still an enjoyable film. Of course films like Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, and Mean Streets stand on their own through the test of time.The film centers around Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who is an undercover cop working inside Frank Costello's (Nicholson) gang and Colin Sullivan (Damon) who plays a cop working as a spy for Costello and his crew, keeping the Boston police off his tail.What follows for the next 2 and a half hours is an intricate crime drama with richly developed characters and an often vulgar, blood soaked story that will have you fully enthralled for the duration of the film.I don't want to spend all this time discussing the plot, I don't want to be put in the position of spoilers and giving away the best parts of the film. I am here to say that this is easily the front runner for the best film of 2006. Scorsese returns to his mobster roots and does not miss a beat. For a Scorsese fan all his signatures are there, from a soundtrack that could not relate better to the images on screen, to the brutality of the violence... This is no cheesy WWE John Cena film, this is a raw, bloody 'R' rated movie for all the right reasons. This combined with the Boston setting make this a choice film for this boring time of yawn inducing October releases.The cast is suburb, Damon, DiCaprio, Nicholson are all equally amazing. Nicholson especially pitch perfect as Frank Costello, the aging crime lord that gets the sense there is a cop in his crew. Matt Damon is also amazing as the prick dirty cop working for Costello keeping him out of harms way. DiCaprio of course proves why he is worth every penny and this role really solidifies that he is the real deal. On a side note I find it funny that Ben Affleck gets tons of press, but has been in only one good movie ('Chasing Amy'), but friend Damon, has not only been getting quality roles, but roles that make money as well.While these are the key players, they take nothing away from an amazing supporting cast including Alec Baldwin, Mark Walberg and Martin Sheen, all do an amazing job in bringing very complex, unforgettable characters to blistering life.Worth a second, and third viewing, just to watch the acting alone, but also to really immerse yourself in the complex world of cops and criminals.Highly recommended, and worth every penny. This holds up as a very good reason than great movies can still be made. It's just sad that there are not more movies that are of this quality.",9,2,4,8 October 2006
Lord of War," Really Good Overlooked Film
","I just rented this the other day. I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. The story was thought provoking, interesting and about something that speaks to these times. It seems that all to often films don't want to deal with the real world, because the 'PC POLICE' will come out after them. This film takes a pretty good look at how one's actions can basically affect the world. 'Lord of War' had a really strong message. I think the directing was amazing Andrew Niccol did a more than credible job. Too bad this movie didn't fare well at the box office. I think people would be pleasantly surprised. But then again, since it wasn't overloaded with CGI, based on an old TV show or comic book it's no wonder the general public never sought this out.",8,1,2,6 July 2006
