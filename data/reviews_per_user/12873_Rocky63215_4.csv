The Longest Yard," Good Movie
","It was an excellent movie with great acting. By the way there are only two former professional football players in the movie as well as two former wrestlers in Bill Goldberg and Stone Cold Steve Austin. As for the movie it was good and it was well written. If Tom Cruise can date Katie Holmes then Adam Sandler can play a QB and for your information if you have blockers it doesn't matter how big or small you are if you are able to throw the football you are going to be making plays. Sandler also took a lot of punishment playing as well and I'd gladly see this movie again. So, if you're looking for a movie to go and see thats worth your time go see this movie don't waste your time on some stupid movie like Star Wars Episode Three Revenge of Darth Vader who is really Anakin Skywalker. No one cares.",10,1,7,29 May 2005
Spider-Man 2," Sucked
",I went to see an action movie and all I got was a boring beginning that didn't start picking up into the end which I didn't' get to see cause I was sleeping through it. I love Kirsten Dunst she's a great actress very pretty too. I mean could they make the movie seem more realistic. Daredevil was more realistic and I still believe that it was a better movie than the two Spidermans combined. Tobie Maguire isn't' that great of an actor and he just flat out stunk again. The only reason I went is because my family went and the only worthwhile thing was seeing how beautiful Kirsten Dunst looks like in a wedding dress. By the way it was so easy for her to figure out that he was spiderman she knew it at the end of the first why didn't they go into that instead of drawing it out and having her engaged to some wack off in NASA.,1,7,20,6 July 2004
To Kill a Mockingbird," Even Worse Book
","I had to read this book. It was one of the most horrible books I've ever had to read. Then we were stuck watching the movie in class. It was horrible and boring to watch. Maybe you think I'm young and I don't know a classic when I see it, but I do know this isn't a classic. If you want to watch a classic watch Casablanca there's a movie to watching that's a classic. Or Aresnic and The Old Lace there's a great movie too. Horrible acting the only reason to watch the movie is to see who plays that deranged neighbor. I'd like to give specifics why I don't like it but I haven't read it in a while but I do know I couldn't stand the book. Then again people thought the Lord of the Rings was a good movie. I don't' get it, it was sooooooo boring I fell asleep in the first one. The second one was more action packed but still wasn't the best movie I've ever seen.",1,16,91,1 December 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Boring
","This movie is so damn boring. One of if not the worst film ever made. Give me a real movie with real actors with a producer with real talent. These movies made me want to throw up they were so horrible, don't waste your 3 hours watching this movie it's not worth it there's better ways to spend your time. Did anyone really believe that green thing that can't even talk. It was like that stupid Jar-Jar character they put on Star Wars. Now if you want to see a movie with action and adventure with better writing then go watch Face/Off don't waste a minute of your time on this movie. Please, who ever voted and made this movie #3 where it doesn't belong it should be along the lines of worst movie ever. I rather watch From Justin To Kelly a billion times then waste my time watching a movie like this.",1,6,26,8 May 2005
