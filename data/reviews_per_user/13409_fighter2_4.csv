The Avengers," Action Satisfaction
","Overall, this film delivers and this compliment comes from a Marvel fan. Though each individual hero remains true to character from their singular franchise, the film is nearly a live action cartoon. There is a humanism that live action brings to screen that animation lacks; It's called emotion, and Marvel's 'Avengers' noticeably void of it. Regardless of that critique, no one goes for these types of films for ultra realism, but more so for the production value. Great action choreography, Johanssen is terribly hot in black leather, plenty of explosions and the Hulk does what he does best: 'SMASH'. The idea of some of my favorite hero's banding together, overcoming inter personal differences during a time of dire need and ultimately saving the day left me satisfied. This one is a must see and I recommend paying the extra to watch it in 3D. BTW, don't forget to hang around until the FULL EXTENT of the credits have passed. There are two additional scenes, one of which gives clues to a sequel and if you're a Marvel Fan, you'll be giddy as a school girl with a bag of lolly pops when you see it.",7,2,6,19 May 2012
Sucker Punch," Sucker Punch...Sweet, Tart and Satisfying.
","Snyder brilliantly translates the story of a victimized girl who has been wrongfully incarcerated in an insane asylum and uses her creative imagination not only to escape the ruins of her life in her mind, but to hatch and execute a creative plan to escape the throngs of her captors in reality. Visually stunning and truly touching. Browning and Malone compellingly portray innocent femininity and strength without going overboard. For the girls: Girl Power. For the guys, hot chicks with loads of gun/sword play and action. Watching this film is like a stint in a daydream. Jump aboard the roller coaster and simply go for the ride.

Super 8," Super 8... Super Satisfies
","Hats of to Spielberg who truly has a talent for spotting a great story. The film is a bit of a period piece that follows a young boy still coping with an emotional loss who unwittingly embarks on an adventure of finding himself and discovering love all while unraveling the mystery of a tragic train accident that hits his small town. This film strongly resembles the mystery of E.T. and the camaraderie of goonies. Good plot, great story. Abrams is great at using the camera and angles to build suspense and to properly place you in the action. I do feel the film suffers from snip happy editing; too much footage left on the cutting room floor. Though the released version is already near the two hour limit, an additional 30 minutes of character and story building would have made this an undisputed instant classic. As I'm suggesting the film should have been a little longer, I certainly enjoyed it ;-). Recommended.",7,2,4,12 June 2011
X-Men: First Class," Surprisingly 2 Dimensional for Live Action Film
","The movie follows the development of a not so unlikely friendship between a young Charles Xavier (soon to be Professor X) and Eric Lensherr (Magneto). Though the story successfully ties in critical world events of the past, which serve to date the piece and connect with audiences, I found the film lacked a certain depth expected of a Hollywood production. Certain still camera shots, the noticeable lack of extra's and dialogue that seemed far too convenient at times made this installment of the X-Men franchise appear more like the traditional 2-D cartoon than a live action film. This from a Marvel super-hero fan: I grew up reading the books. Hollywood's cutting corners yet ticket prices are going up. Decent film. Wait for Digital Download / Blu-Ray / DVD.",7,0,2,12 June 2011
