The King's Speech," An entertaining and lavish crowd-pleasing event
","Much like The Fighter, I saw The King's Speech just before Christmas and never got around to writing a review until now. It had been hyped since its premiere at the festivals in Telluride and Toronto in September, and was always thought to be a front runner for the big prize at the Academy Awards. I clamoured to see the movie as it got more hyped as the weeks went on, and when I finally got to see the film in limited release, in a surprisingly packed theatre no less, I was more than just a little surprised.Taking its tale from a true story, Prince Albert, the Duke of York (Colin Firth) has a stammer and cannot speak properly in front of a crowd, or just about anyone. Many 'unconventional' treatments are sought to try and fix it (the audience sadly does not get to see just how many), before the future Queen Mother Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) finds Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian living in London whose eccentric methods just may do the trick. After a rather disappointing first session, Albert leaves in an aggravated hurry, not thinking Logue's methods were of any use. But as it becomes clear that he may soon get a seat on the throne as the King of England, Albert heads back to see if Logue can truly help him overcome his speech problems.While British period pieces have always been Oscar fodder, they typically run rather long and despite housing incredible performances, usually end up being rather stuffy and boring (Stephen Frears' The Queen is a particular standout in my mind). And while there is a bit of stuffiness and boredom in some of its proceedings, The King's Speech manages to evoke an even greater sense of emotion than I thought it ever would. It is heartbreaking in some instances, outrageously hilarious in others, and when it gets to certain crescendos, deeply moving. The controversial and much discussed scene involving Firth yelling out a series of expletives in anger is of particular note, because it manages to be all three at once. But above all, the film manages at all times to be a crowd-pleasing event, always anticipating the audience's reaction. Having seen a plethora of films last year ranging from incredible to absolute garbage, I can say this film was the one that elicited the most varied and prominent reactions from the audience.While all of the technical elements are as great as you expect them to be, it is the acting that delivers in spades at every turn.Firth is simply magnificent as Albert and future King George VI. He pours his heart into every scene, and helps take the audience on the wild range of emotions the film helps deliver. He is enchanting and animated in every single one of his scenes, and you just cannot help but feel for him throughout his ordeal and ultimate quest to overcome his stammer. Firth is simply inspiring, and delivers yet another incredible performance to add to his already overflowing collection. His work in A Single Man was already enough to deserve every accolade possible. His work here only further establishes it.While Rush's performance as Logue is not as Earth-shatteringly incredible as Firth's, it is still rather excellent and considerably entertaining. He is more nuanced and low-key in his portrayal than I thought he would be, but he manages to hold his own even when he is eliciting scene chomping responses from Firth. His work here is much less pronounced (even though he has a few bizarre over-the-top scenes), but is the exact ingredient needed to make Firth's as astonishing as it is. Seeing them play off each other, just chatting between each other in often lengthy scenes, is worth seeing the film even if it was not the as wildly acclaimed as it was. Rush knows exactly what buttons and emotions to convey, and while he is nowhere near as consistent as Firth has been, he still manages to prove what an awesome talent he is.Supporting turns from Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi and the always reliable Guy Pierce are all great, and help keep the film as lively as possible. Carter as Elizabeth is of particular note, because even though she is completely overshadowed by Firth and Rush, she still delivers some of her best work in her role. It is a thankless job as she is more of a background figure than anything else, but her grace and silent affections are quite visible at all times. She is the woman behind the man, and she always manages to make something of her character in every scene she gets. Her great work here more than helps to wash out some of the awful taste she left in her ridiculously over-the-top performance as the Red Queen in the horrifically disappointing Alice in Wonderland.But for all its greatness and how incredibly entertaining a film that The King's Speech is, I found that it was merely content with being a great film driven by incredible performances, and nothing more. I have had trouble in the weeks following seeing the film just trying to pin-point what holds the film back from eternal greatness, and it has held me back from writing how I felt about the film. I do not want to dwell or criticize it like some have for how it feels like a glorified 'Movie of the Week' (only for fleeting moments, never to the exaggerated depths some have indicated), but in a year that gave us such wildly original films like Black Swan, Inception and The Social Network, which really challenged us as an audience, The King's Speech seems merely content as being an entertaining throwaway. It is a great film, but compared to others, it just does not seem great enough.8.5/10.",8,0,0,25 February 2011
Black Swan," A beautiful and nightmarish masterpiece
","There are not enough words in the English language to describe the praise Darren Aronofsky deserves for Black Swan. It was one of the most talked about and sought after films at this year's Toronto International Film Festival (which I managed to snag a ticket for), and for good reason – it is a masterpiece that is just as much beautiful as it is nightmarish.Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) has toiled for years within a New York ballet company, always pushing herself. The company has fallen under hard times, and director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) makes the swift decision to put on a new rendition of the classic Swan Lake. With the company's go-to lead pushed into retirement, Nina is quickly selected to be the lead in the new ballet. With competition arriving in the form of new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis), and the demanding desire for perfection from both Thomas and her overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), Nina begins a journey into dark uncharted territory.Black Swan is an enthralling and visceral experience from beginning to end. Aronofsky has used what he has learned from making the raw and unflinching The Wrestler and the cerebral horror and incredibly disturbing Requiem for a Dream, and has crafted a film that you will simply not be able to take your eyes off of. He builds up rather slow, but right after that first moment of off-the-rails insanity, he delivers one hell of an incredible piece of cinema. One that is not easily able to be classified to any one genre.While you may have read suggestions that Black Swan and The Wrestler are two halves of the same film, make no mistake at looking at it any further beyond the comparison of being about two people toiling within two very different forms of art. Black Swan is never a low budget character piece. It is a film that navigates between being thrilling and horrific at the same time. While the horror elements start to take more prominence in the second half (specifically the rather squeamish elements of body horror, done in a way that would make David Cronenberg proud), the film never lets one completely overtake the other. It manages to maintain this sense of dread, darkness and rather graphic wound/injury infliction throughout.The visuals and editing are the drive of what helps make the film so well done. Contrasting blacks and whites so frequently give the obvious hints of good and evil, innocence and darkness. But Aronofsky likes to throw in hints of ambiguity at every turn, changing the colours for each character depending on the scene, and depending on what they may or may not be doing. Even the scenery and set design is in plain black and whites, always making the audience guess the true motivations and intentions of both character and creator. Adding in the element of reflection, both in others and the self (mostly through mirrors), only helps compound these feelings of ambiguity and confusion. It will consistently keep audiences thinking about what is being shown and what is actually going on. The subtle visual effects and astoundingly well done score only help add to the greatness.Aronofsky also deserves recognition for the film's lean running time. When so many films are often far too long and dragged out, this film maintains a sense of momentum that never gets lost at any point. The film's slow points are never dragged out, merely well padded out for the shift from Nina being innocent to adrenaline soaked horror as she descends into the realm of darkness. Rather gracefully, Aronofsky manages to balance the goal of Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin's script to blend Nina's tale with the story of Swan Lake itself, and never loses sight or direction at any instance. This is bravado style filmmaking at its finest, and more than suggests that the brilliant direction in Requiem for a Dream was not a fluke.Portman, who has shown her acting merits before in the likes of Closer, delivers a startlingly intense and beautiful performance as Nina. At once you can see the innocent, sexually repressed little girl who just wants to please her mother, and the sexually depraved fallen angel, inching closer towards independence and adulthood. She is very clearly not 'well' in the beginning of the film, and as the film progresses, you can practically chart her 180-degree reversal in character. She is downright terrifying in many instances, and more than proves her worth as an actress. When she finally dons makeup late in the film, her transformation from a once promising talent to a full blown powerhouse talent becomes simply marvelous to watch.The supporting cast only helps to further complement Portman's extraordinary performance. Cassel is amazing as always as the slimy and twisted Thomas. We never really get more than hints at his true intentions, but Cassel makes every moment on-screen simply amazing. Kunis delivers a level of depth I never thought was possible for her. She commands the screen with every new scene, and this performance will easily act as a starmaking role for her. Hershey is even better; practically stealing the screen away from Portman's magnetizing performance. She makes Erica into that monster of a character everyone loves to hate, and brings a level of intensity to every mere moment she appears in. If anyone is even nearly close to equaling Portman's performance, it would be her. Despite only appearing for a few minutes, Winona Ryder is amazing in her role as the former lead ballerina Beth. I just wish she could have chewed up more scenery.Black Swan is an incredible film from beginning to end, and will not easily leave you. It is a masterpiece of unheralded success, and is easily the best film I saw at TIFF. Watch out for it at Oscar time – it just may steal the show.10/10.",10,915,1277,19 September 2010
Changeling," Crumbles under its own ambition for more
","Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) is a single mother, raising a young son, Walter (Gattlin Griffith), while working as a supervisor to a telephone operator agency. She leaves Walter at home when going to work one day, and find him to be lost upon her return. She calls the police, an investigation is launched, and she is reunited with her son months later. Only, she is convinced the child is an imposter, and is not her son.I wanted to really enjoy Changeling. I always give Clint Eastwood a chance with his frequently Oscar-nominated films (having thoroughly enjoyed his last offering, Letters from Iwo Jima), but I am finding that I may be a little too lenient. Yet again, Eastwood gives us a movie that proves he has talent, but lacks the right formula to be considered as anything extraordinary.While the basic story is there (a very interesting true one at that), it gets muddled into a deeper subplot of corruption, scandal and murder. It is not confusing in the least, but becomes frequently annoying. Once the film starts moving and Collins is reunited with her 'son', it just loses its focus and starts swinging its hands into other things. Sure, they are integral to the film, but they feel so open-ended and thrown on that they look and sound superfluous when they first appear. A meeting between the integral characters Det. Ybarra (Michael Kelly) and Gordon Northcott (Jason Butler Harner) is set up as being merely scene filler, but only becomes important much later in the film. It is troublesome in every instance, and plagues the film from beginning to end.What does not help is the film's running time. Clocking in at 141 minutes, Changeling feels about 20-30 minutes longer than it needs to be. When Eastwood is not hammering us over the head with how distraught and confused Collins is, he is packing on the emphasis on the near-superfluous items that become important only as the film draws to a close (or on scenes that were clumsily added in for an effect lacking any subtly). It feels like writer J. Michael Stracynski knew he had found a great story to tell, but had a few too many problems adapting it to screen. Why else would we have a wonky timeline, repetitive sequences, and all-too predictable moments that are meant to shock, but instead induce the audience to rolling their eyes? This is not meant to be a life lesson-style story, but merely a recreation of history. Stracynski, in his attempt to stay true to the source material, cuts very little out of his storyline, and the film suffers under its own weight because of it. Where it needs to be fast-paced, it drags its heels. When it needs to slow down and dwell on something shocking, time just flies by. Is there any real need to not know which way you want to play the film? Jolie, as the main character, has seen better days and far superior performances. Yes, her exquisite acting chops are put to the test in some scenes, but a lot just require her to almost act beneath herself. We saw her as a struggling, very pregnant wife in A Mighty Heart, acting as journalist Mariane Pearl. While by no means a great movie, Heart gave a great means for Jolie to express herself in a depressingly serious role, allowing her to pull on heart strings and prove she is not just a one-trick pony turned paparazzi fodder. But here, where she plays a very similar role, she seems to be merely aping off her old performances. Shades of Pearl are obvious, and shades of her Oscar-winning turn in Girl, Interrupted are even more noticeable. She just seems incapable of giving any real means of attention to the part, and looks like she is merely going through the motions, just hoping for that next Oscar nom. A scene near the end of the film, where Collins acts totally and inexplicably out of character, only makes her role seem that more staged than it already was. Her character goes from somewhat believable to a total fantasy in less than three minutes; which is never a good sign for anyone.Jeffrey Donovan, playing Captain J.J. Jones makes for a great antagonist, but he is very underused. His accent may be a bit wavy, but he beams brightly when he shares the screen with Jolie. Much the same goes for John Malkovich, who plays a local radio-based Pastor who loves to enthrall his listeners with stories of corruption and evil within the LAPD. He too is shafted (much like in Burn After Reading), merely acting as an over-sized prop for Jolie as the film progresses. Both Kelly and Harner do great work for the small roles they are given, but as the films drags almost exclusively around the story behind these two characters. In a stronger film, both of these guys could have been stars.While the film suffers under the weight Eastwood and Stracynski are forcing upon it, it does manage to set the 1920s scenery up quite well. From the costumes to the cars to the sets to even the drab and dark weather, Changeling is a tour-de-force for its technical means. The artists who put together this maverick vision clearly have a grasp on the material, and have an even better idea on where it is headed from moment one. They put a lot of effort into these designs, and it shows in how realistic and authentic they look.Changeling is an interesting movie, but gets bogged down under too much being pumped into the story. It knows what it wants to be, but it makes itself out to be something totally different. Jolie is the star, but the supporting cast does a much better job holding it up than she does. Its watchable, but not more than once.6/10.",6,9,16,8 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Enjoyable, but not as extraordinary as it could have been
","Although it provided an absurd amount of fun and adventure, not to mention one of the most iconic film characters of the past decade, I kind of wish Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl failed miserably and just became a cult hit. Despite enjoying both of the cash-grabbing sequels that followed the first time, rewatching and further recollections of the events that transpire have proved the films to be miserable, messy and often times inanely silly attempts at trying to recreate the magic of the first film, but failing on almost all counts. So you can immediately see where the skepticism comes in when preparing to watch On Stranger Tides, the fourth film in the franchise. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back in London, where he finds out about an impending trip to find the previously teased Fountain of Youth. While he is not really prepared to go on a quest to find it for the King of England like Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is, he does get roped into coming alongside former flame Angelica (Penélope Cruz) who is also searching for it. And her father, the captain of her ship, just happens to be the notorious pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane). Even though it may not sound like much (especially after the unbearable amount of subplots that seem to describe this franchise), On Stranger Tides still manages to dedicate plenty of time to a few story lines and each of the main characters. But this is not nearly as terrible as it may sound. Rather wisely, this is the shortest film in the series by a long shot, and it never feels nearly as stretched out as the rest. The majority of fat has been trimmed, and the story follows as straight a path as it can as these pirates journey to find the mythical fountain. There are no silly anecdotes and minuscule character scenes devised to pad out the running time and in turn, make the film obscenely lengthy. There are no useless supporting characters designed merely to provide some sort of wacky comedic effect using their fake body parts, asinine methods of speech or general stupidity. In fact, outside of Depp and Rush, the only returning non-cameo character is Kevin McNally's Gibbs, who is even more downplayed than I thought he would be. As wonderful as this may sound, it comes at a price – there are no real standout characters in the film at all, and this includes returning characters. Blackbeard is built up to be an evil dictator and heinous villain, but they barely give McShane any time to let us see that side of his character. He gets a pretty awesome introduction, then sits back and looks bored for the rest of the film. The addition of Sam Claflin and Astrid Berges-Frisbey as an unconventional lovestruck pair may remind audiences of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, but they lack chemistry and come off more annoying and forced than anything else. Rush seems to have been toned down and held back from stealing any scenes or time from anyone. Cruz looks like she is enjoying herself, and seems to be getting the most enjoyment out of what her character says and does. But even with the conflicting emotions Angelica displays at every turn, we never really get the opportunity to feel for her as a character. Which leaves us with the former Captain Jack. Depp has been wisely dialed back, and is more conventional in his zany, over-the-top antics. He is more in tune with his Oscar-nominated performance in Black Pearl than he is with his amped up, overcooked roles in the films that followed. He is the best part about On Stranger Tides, and it is because he actually looks like he is attempting to act, as opposed to doing his very best to make a complete ass of himself. He has a lot of great lines and even better character moments, and these help bring back that initial sense of fun we had when we were first introduced to him eight years ago. The special effects are just as great as always, even though there are no show stopping additions like Davy Jones and his crew. It actually felt more realistic than I imagined it would, and a whole lot less fantastical. I can say I appreciated the more minimalistic approach, and liked that the film did not really overdo it in any specific instance. A scene involving the attempted procuring of a mermaid is of particular note, not just because it is the lengthiest and most significant action scene in the film, but because it is done incredibly well and effectively. The 3D offers very little to the film, but rather surprisingly does not get in the way of any of its visuals. For all that works and fails in On Stranger Tides, I found that the film provided a light amount of entertainment and mild enjoyment, but not much else. They just could have done so much more with this film than what ended up in the final product. It certainly made up for the past two entries in the series, but it feels like it has come much too late. The franchise is dead, and this last hurrah is simply that. It may set up for future sequels, but could easily just be content at going out with a finale that was satisfying enough. I know we inevitably have not seen the end of Jack Sparrow, but I can only hope with a bit more effort, they can make another movie that feels like it could reside on the same plain as the original film. 7/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",7,2,4,29 May 2011
Frost_Nixon," Langella is astonishing in this fascinating film
","After resigning the Presidency, Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) lived a life of silence. He never spoke about his misdeeds, and he seemed to want to just leave the life behind. Enter David Frost (Michael Sheen), a British talk show host who botched his job in the US and is now syndicated in Australia. He gets the great idea to interview Nixon about his life and the scandals that plagued his presidency. But no one really wants to go for it. But Frost never loses hope, and eventually the interviews are set.The entirety of the film is a mix of fact and fiction-style storytelling leading up, obviously, to the legendary interviews between Nixon and Frost. But even if part of it never actually happened, there is still some rather fascinating film-making going on here.I am not usually a fan of Ron Howard, but coupled with Peter Morgan (who also made a very interesting story out of The Queen a few years ago), he is practically on fire. Here is a movie that could have just been a biographical-esquire piece laced with boring, uninteresting Oscar-baiting material. But instead, it makes even the tiniest of details seem important and worthwhile. From courting Nixon to researching material to coax answers out of the man, Howard and Morgan have crafted something surprisingly well done and all the more relevant for the times (as another disgraced President was in the process of leaving at the time of the film's release).The filmmakers seem to have an eye for detail, and every costume and set looks straight out of the 1970's. Even for someone who was not even alive at that point in history, looking at the sheer production design of the picture is a clear mark of accuracy. The harsh and minimalist style lighting make the film look like it was even made at that time, instead of in 2008. The immense amount of smoking done by characters is also a nice touch, and hearkens back to the days of All the President's Men, and puts it right firmly beside it as a piece of historical fiction.Sadly, the film follows the historical fiction genre a little too close, and frequently drags itself out longer than it needs to. I was interested throughout the film, but felt it frequently drifted away from its point. If it stayed on course throughout, I think it could have been a real candidate in the big race, as opposed to being merely a good film.Although it is not entirely unique, the film loops in character testimonials every few scenes to help accentuate both the bit players in the film, and help with the historical accuracy. It almost makes the film transcend its status of merely being a dramatization with a heavy amount of fictional elements, to being a full blown recreation of the actual events. Again, it makes the film feel authentic, and gives it a documentary style feel, almost like the camera is an unacknowledged film-making team keeping an eye on both camps in order to make a film like this years later.The supporting characters are given quite a bit to do, but never get any real time focused on them. But with the small amount they do get, they help complement the film in a way that would have made the film far too boring if it was a two-man show. Matthew Macfadyen, Oliver Platt and especially Sam Rockwell are excellent in their roles as Frost's researchers. Macfadyen continues to prove why he should be miles further ahead in his Hollywood career, and Platt was as good as he was here. Rockwell, a heavily underrated actor, gives a flavor to his performance that makes it distinctively unique. Coupled along with his raucous performance in Choke, he is slowly on his way to making a stronger name for himself. I can only hope he is up at the Oscars with a nomination in a few years. Being an almost totally obscure character actor can only work for someone this good for so long.Surprisingly, Nixon's side gets very little material between them, other than the blink and you will miss it performance by the always reliable Toby Jones, and from Kevin Bacon. Yes, Bacon is the punchline of a lot of jokes (and even has that incredibly amusing 'Six Degrees' game basically dedicated to him), but he is rather slowly making his rounds into becoming a great actor. It took a long time, but with his small role here, he seems to be on to something. Just watching him emote in his small amount of scenes is just great.Of course, the heavy hitters are the best thing about the movie.Langella's portrayal of Nixon is just astonishing. He has the man down to the most minute of details, and watching him recreate Nixon's history making scenes is downright chilling. He is that close to the man in his performance. Yes, he may still look like Frank Langella under the makeup (and is evidently taller too), but it would be very hard to tell the man apart from the real thing if he was still living. If Sean Penn and Mickey Rourke were not already battling it out, Langella would have been the obvious Best Actor of the year.Sheen unfortunately, has to compensate for how towering Langella is in his performance. He does a fabulous job playing the man who is trying to measure up to greatness, but he looks visually like he is putting in too much effort. It looks like it will be a running schtick for him (as he was the same in The Queen), but he makes the most of it anyway, and delivers a wonderful performance, miles ahead of everyone else.Frost/Nixon is a good and fascinating film, but it could have been stronger. Langella's performance is nothing short of astonishing.8/10.",8,1,2,21 February 2009
Walk the Line," If Only Ray Hadn't Come Out First...
","I really wish Ray did not come out in 2004, before Walk the Line. Because Line unfortunately suffers greatly at the hands of that overly boring and overly flawed film, which basically had an amazing performance by Jamie Foxx, some great Ray Charles music, and not much else.Line, while essentially almost the exact same story as Ray, but without all of the racist elements, and using Johnny Cash, is a much better film, and has a much better story. In fact, everything about it is better, even down to Joaquin Phoenix besting Jamie Foxx's Oscar winning performance (but unfortunately not Phillip Seymour Hoffman's).The music is of course, great, and as said, so are the performances. Phoenix is fabulous as Cash, and undoubtedly, will probably never be any better. While not really shining at first, Witherspoon makes a terrific performance out of June Carter Cash, and was rightfully given her Oscar. They are heartfelt (as is the rest of the cast, even though Robert Patrick is underused), and even though the movie is a tad bit long and boring (what's with these musical biopics?), it makes up for it in all of the technical departments.The mythology of the Man in Black is very well presented, and is very interesting as it goes on. And while Ray asked us to feel sorry for the main character at every turn, you can't help but feel angry at the main character in Line. The emotional impact is stronger, and it helps drive the heart of the film.The film could have done with a good few minutes cut right out of the film, and it would have been all the better for it. And if they missed out on the Ray boat, it would have been nominated as Best Picture instead of Capote.8/10.",8,0,0,9 March 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Totally imperfect, but packing one of the best character performances ever
","For months, I could not go anywhere, see or read anything without hearing something about Borat: Cultural Learnings of American for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. It was being hailed as groundbreaking, and hilarious beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Everyone I knew wanted to see it, and I just stood back and could not understand what the big fuss was about. Yeah, it looked fairly amusing, but nothing more than that. Sacha Baron Cohen's Da Ali G Show never impressed me when I watched random episodes, so I was not in belief that this film would.But with all of the hype, it made me want to see it opening weekend. Unfortunately, I never managed to. I caught it a few weeks later without the benefit of a huge audience watching it with me. And for the most part, I think my original assumption was correct.Basically for the two people who have zero clue what the movie is about (despite it now being on DVD), Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a Kazak journalist sent to the United States to observe the American way of life. He brings his TV crew with him every step of the way, and begins to explore the country. But because of his origin, he is outrageously obnoxious in his behaviour. But for some reason, it only becomes more tolerated as he continues on, allowing for many surprising responses from the people he comes across.The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is racist, misogynist, raunchy, and just downright vile in the way he acts. And the Americans he talks to either do not realize what is going on, or actually agree with him. The tour he takes across the United States involves a plethora of random, everyday citizens being duped in this fashion. The fact that the film was marketed so well in the US, and then further made millions, attests to the idea that this may just be the greatest practical joke every played.But unfortunately, it is a one-note joke. The film loses steam after thirty minutes, and can barely pick up afterwards. It strikes a pretty solid barrier, and just cannot recover no matter how hard it tries. Yes, the proceeding minutes had their share of laughs and shocks, but nowhere near as much as the first little bit. It just sets itself up far too well, and fails to live up to its original design. Its nifty idea and execution really should have told people from the start that it would not work for a ninety minute long film, but I guess they had more faith in the picture than I did.Another upsetting thing about the film was the grand amount of preplanning. It was continually being sold to the audience as being spur-of-the-moment, and very uncoordinated. But as the film progresses, you can tell that some moments are actually being filmed this way, and that some reek of being rehearsed. It takes away from the satire the film had built up for itself, and really brings down the genuine enjoyment for the film. I know it had barely anywhere to go from the start, but making it almost so that it was written unnaturally before hand, just takes away from the genuine impact that the film has. The fact that the writing was nominated at the Oscars also does an effective amount of damage to the final moments of the film, which otherwise would have been drop dead funny instead of just amusing.The film-making techniques on the other hand, are just magical. You really get a sense of the gritty and grungy documentary look the filmmakers wanted from the minute the film starts, right up until its finale. The hand-held camera works beautifully in every sequence, and the very personal diary feel that the film gains during the second act works very well. Just trying to keep up with Cohen in certain scenes seemed to have been a test of endurance on its own. The film is very low budget, and it shows in how unique the film looks. If it had not been so heavily publicized, I think I actually would have had trouble deferring whether or not it was an actual documentary if I saw it while flipping through TV channels.There are no proper words to describe Cohen and his schtick. It really is a sight to marvel all on its own. His dedication and perfection in this role is nearly unheralded in my mind. He goes beyond transcending himself into the character. Every moral fibre of this character is ingrained in Cohen's performance. You do not see Cohen, and you do not see an actor. You see a rude and ignorant Kazak journalist. He never lets up for a second, and is always acting in character. This fictional character is brought to life with so much energy, that he actually forms into a real life person. The line between reality and fiction is just so thin here, that it really begs the question of how far an actor will go for his character. And he is absolutely hysterical to watch.Ken Davitian, who plays Borat's producer and sidekick Azamat, is also very good in his performance. He is almost always watching, and is so subtle. He never breaks a smile, and he is just so serious that he complements how perfect Cohen's character is. He is obviously not as strong an actor (and is barely understandable), but his valiant efforts do go rewarded.Even with its flaws, Borat is an experience everyone should take. Some may find it funnier than others, and some may not find it funny at all. There is a bit of a middle ground, but not much. And in the process of watching, everyone will be able to marvel at one of the greatest character performances ever committed to celluloid.7.5/10.",7,85,152,25 March 2007
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Entertaining and a lot more fun than the original outing
","As much as I loved the character interactions and insane chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, I was very much let down by Sherlock Holmes when I first saw it a few years ago. It was a really stylish and well-made film, but the storyline bored me to tears. I came in incredibly excited to see it, and left wishing it had ended sooner. With the obvious sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows upon us, I figured I would go in with much lower expectations and brace for something along the same lines.Europe is at the brink of war, with many little seemingly unconnected events occurring across the nations. Sherlock Holmes (Downey Jr.) believes it to be the work of the brilliant Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris). He enlists the help of his sidekick, Watson (Law), to help him uncover the truth, before it is too late.With less of a focus on the occult, a stronger plot and a significantly more interesting villain, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows outdoes its predecessor in many respects. It ups the thrills and the action, continues the fun, and delivers one of the better sequel going experiences this year.Even though the story is a bit wonky in certain respects (more on that in a moment), I feel A Game of Shadows manages to feel a lot more grounded than the original. There is a clear storyline, and an even clearer path of where the film wants to go. It stalls here and there, as I imagined it would, but it never lingers like the original did. The art direction is just as incredible as it was, and the special effects seem to have been improved greatly. Where the first film flopped around, this film picks up the slack. While Downey Jr. and Law are just as impeccable and well matched as they were the first time round, the film benefits greatly from the addition of Harris as Moriarty. The character's presence was felt throughout the first film, but the film noticeable lost its edge by simply referring to him in passing and hinting at what a sequel could have had in store. Bringing him into the fold, he immediately is tenfold better than Mark Strong ever could have hoped to be. Watching Harris match wits with Downey is simply astounding, and makes for the most wildly enjoyable parts of the film. There is never a dull moment when he is around, and instead of making the film drone on, he invigorates it with an immense amount of energy. Harris knows exactly how to look deceptive, even with a wide grin and dialogue that does not even hint at ulterior motives. His looks are downright terrifying in a lot of instances. This is his first major film role, and I can only hope filmmakers continue using his dastardly skills for antiheroes and villains alike. I think the film's biggest hurtle, and the one that hurts it the most, is that there are simply too many characters and too many of them did not need to appear in the first place. Rapace's character is nothing more than a plot device, used to connect certain sections together and forgotten almost entirely all too often. The practically blink-and-you- will-miss them moments for Rachel McAdams and Eddie Marsan feel more like Richie peddling to the fans, as opposed to actually serving a real point to the film. It is fun seeing them show up again, but considering they have little to no effect on the plot, they could have easily just never showed up at all. But the far worst offender of not serving any purpose is Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes. He brings a ridiculous amount of humour to the film, and he is a welcome addition on the onset. But as the film progresses, it becomes clear he is merely there simply to make the film even more ludicrous and silly than Downey Jr. makes it. When the inevitable third film drops, I hope they actually use him effectively, instead of making his appearance feel like a mere tease.What also hurts the film is Richie's incessant need to use slow motion in every action sequence. While it works insanely and surprisingly well for the film's centrepiece involving a foot chase through a forest, it feels like overkill in almost every other instance. We understand from the first film that Holmes likes to evaluate the moves of both his adversaries and himself before he makes them, but watching him plot it out helps drag the film out longer than it needs to be. It is fun and worthwhile when it is used sparingly, or used to draw attention to something specific. But when Richie is one-upping Zack Snyder in the worst possible way, it begs the question of whether he learned any mistakes from the first film or not. At just under 130 minutes, I feel like a good fifteen minutes of slow motion could have been sped up, and would have looked just as great. Hell, Richie potentially could have shown off a bit of his own style too, instead of just what he cribbed from everyone else.While the film still has its problems, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is an enjoyable ride from start to finish. It maintained my interest, where the first film had me counting the excruciating minutes before it would end. Richie still has a lot to learn about as a filmmaker (and even more as a man who creates his own style instead of Tarantino-ing from others), he does know how to make a crafty film. Now if he can stop hinting at future installments and just give us a film that sticks to being about the story at hand, then maybe we might just get the perfect rendition of this legendary detective.8/10.",8,114,206,15 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Better than I expected, but still could have used improvement
","Unlike most people, I really enjoyed Ang Lee's Hulk. Yeah, there was not nearly as much action as any other comic film at the time (or since), but the psychological undertaking that Lee envisioned for the character, to me, worked out quite well. It was boring at times, but it was a much more artistically driven attempt at a comic character that we probably will never see again.So enter The Incredible Hulk, a sequel/reimagining of sorts. The film picks up with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) in Brazil, searching for a cure to his 'disease'. The American government are still searching for him of course, and he is still trying to stay as far away as he can from them.What is interesting about this film, is that if they had done away from the flashback sequences detailing how Banner became the Hulk, it could have easily been a flashier sequel to Lee's original film. But unfortunately (or fortunately for most), the basic skeleton of a storyline is just about the only thing that holds these two films in the same realm of contemporary comic film adaptations.As said, this film is incredibly (no pun intended) flashier than the original. There are three huge action sequences involving the Hulk himself, and at least two other sequences where the Hulk appears not fighting others. These lengthy actions scenes are fairly well filmed, and nearly flawless in their use of CGI. The Hulk interacts with his environments excellently, and there was very little by way of him looking fake (whereas Lee's film struggled in a few scenes to make him look real). Making him smaller is an obvious help to the creators, and clearly allows for better character interactions. I was actually genuinely impressed by the action set pieces, and marvelled at how far special effects have come since Lee's film (obviously, he does not need to be hidden in shadows throughout the majority of his appearances).What is also done well is how nostalgic the film feels. Yes, Lee had Lou Ferrigno and Stan Lee show up, but that was about it. Here, director Louis Leterrier has added the two of them back into the mix, but as more than just small cameos. They actually have parts to play in the story, and Ferrigno even gets to voice the Hulk again. Not to mention the use of the theme song from the 1970's television series.But for anyone looking for any sort of exposition, they may be in for a bit of a disappointment.The story is interesting (about as much as a film that is primarily dictated by being an extended chase can be), and not just a typical sequel story. But it never delves into anyone's motivations for their actions. There is never a real reason why Banner wants to be cured, other than to lead a normal life. No reason for Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) to get Banner back to the US, other than to retrieve what he believes to be 'government property'. No reason for Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to go to the extremes he does, other than to take out the Hulk. It just seems all very one-dimensionally based, and any interactions just seem to be placed to move the film from one action piece to the next. Hell, as amazing as the actions scenes are, they seem extended simply to avoid having the characters engage in any development (outside of dropping obvious things that people who already know something about the Hulk would know).For all the controversy leading up to the film's release, even to the naked eye, it looks like Norton is being held back in lieu of his green CGI counterpart. He never gets a real attempt to chew scenery, and never looks comfortable in any of his scenes. His brilliant repertoire of films suggest that he would have truly made something of this role, but it looks like it was either cut out, or he just failed to take the time to even try. Any character building scenes he has (especially when interacting with Liv Tyler's Betty Ross) are either cut short, or begin and end faster than they started. I will say that his emotions and body language do a lot for his character, but unfortunately, not nearly enough to make this role be on par with anything he has ever done in the past.The supporting cast is much the same. Roth really makes at attempt at making Blonsky to truly feel villainous, but he just seems too over-the-top to make it seem like anything other than a villain straight from the pages of a Hulk comic. I liked him in the role, but he too could have done with a bit more backstory and motivations for his later actions. Hurt is great as always, but only because he has very little to do with the material he is given. His obvious relationship (or lack thereof) with Tyler's character is almost entirely missing and we never truly understand his actions outside of their obviousness. Tyler is almost entirely devoid of anything to make her character feel worthwhile at all, and Tim Blake Nelson's character feels tacked on as a mere indication of a sequel.It may sound like I hated the film, but it was so much more enjoyable than I imagined it would be. Leterrier had a huge undertaking to make his film feel completely different than Lee's, and whether I like his alternate vision or not, it cannot be said that he did not do a hell of a job making it come to life. It does not help that the film merely feels like a piece in the grand scheme of Marvel's attempts to bring an Avengers movie to life, but the film merely makes the most of what it was given. And it only could have been better if it was given more.7/10.",7,2,5,28 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," A story would have made the great action that much better
","Although I was very young at the time, I did enjoy the original Mission: Impossible film in 1996. The special effects were great, and the whole thing was tense as hell. Yes, there were zillions of holes in the plot as I've since found out, but it was a great action thriller with enough story to hold over for the action. But when I finally got around to catching Mission: Imossible 2 in 2000 after the buzz died down a little bit, I was less than impressed. They replaced all the story with extra action, and made the very little story that was left, absolutely ridiculous.So now, we have Mission: Impossible 3, again with Tom Cruise, but headed by Alias and Lost creator J.J. Abrams, aka ABC's Jesus. I was a little intrigued by the trailers, which said absolutely nothing about the film, and was fairly hyped going into the film. But now, I feel a touch disappointed, but a little relieved that Abrams tried to fix the mess that John Woo made, profit worthy or not.Without ruining anything, I will say that the film starts up tense, and doesn't let up whatsoever. Action abounds at every turn, and the break neck pace keeps up the whole way through. Cruise does his actioner best, and keeps it much more serious than it should be. Ving Rhames, as with the rest of the series, makes a great supporting character for Cruise. The rest of the supporting cast including Maggie Q, John Meyers, Billy Crudup, and the very, very little used Larry Fishbourne and Shaun of the Dead's Simon Pegg do excellent as well.But yes, there are problems.The story is almost non-existent, and like it's predecessors, is bullet-holed and ridiculous. As Cruise and Co. go around doing their missions, you never really get a sense of why or how they manage to pull any of them off. There is like 5 minutes of story, and then 20 of action. It goes around and around like this, until all that is left is action. Yes, it's tense, and really thrilling, but there's very little story to back any of it up. No, it's nowhere near as bad as M:I 2, one of the worst yet most profitable sequels in recent years, but it still leaves a lot to be desired.Another bad item is the lack of anything for Michelle Monaghan or Phillip Seymour Hoffman to do. These are both talented actors (Hoffman coming fresh off his Oscar win in Capote), and they're given almost nothing to do. They get very little screen time, and a lot of the screen time they do get, they either are gagged or just not talking for one reason or another. Yes, having a packed cast does take away from a lot of things, but unfortunately, it ruins the overall effect of the film. Cruise cannot carry this baby on his own. And while Rhames helps a lot, players like Monaghan and Hoffman sit in the back row, not having anything to do. When they finally do, it's to attempt and further the plot, only to get sideswiped into even more action. They try their best, but unfortunately come off as next to useless in the whole scheme of things. Given a lot more to do, they could have been fabulous. But at least we know that Hoffman will not be portraying characters things like this anymore.As a first time director, Abrams does a valiant effort to not just make this film out to be all thrilling action, with zero substance. There are many instances in which it may feel like an episode of Alias, but then there are many where it really does compare to the excellent original attempt by Brian De Palma. But where the movie succeeds is unfortunately in its action, and not in its plot. Major story elements are completely glossed over by the action that comes before and after it, and leaves no chance for the audience to actually grab a hold of what has happened. Abrams does a great job on his shows helping this problem, but cannot do a thing here, and it is totally unfortunate.What started out as a tense intelligently flawed blockbuster, evolved into mindless action drivel, only to become a cross between both, with more action than plot. This Cruise franchise has been plagued since the start, and Mission: Impossible 3 does not change any of that. Yes, the film is enjoyable, but is definitely one that requires very little thinking. It is superior to Woo's sequel, but does not match anything that De Palma did. A lot less action, and more character driven material would have made this film an absolute astonishment.But if it's action at every turn that you want, than look no further.7/10.",7,2,4,5 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Pretty good, but too clever for it's own good
","Although I only had caught TV spots and screen-shots from Lucky Number Slevin, I avoided watching the trailer like the plague. It looked interesting enough, with a great cast, so I didn't want to ruin it. After managing to see it, I'm glad that I missed the trailer, but still a little disappointed with the final result.After a short interlude (of which I will not spoil), we are introduced to Slevin (Josh Hartnett). He's in a bathrobe, has a broken nose and has just gotten into New York. He's there to meet with his friend Nick Fisher, whose apartment Slevin is in, but no trace of Fisher. After some knocking, Lindsey (Lucy Liu) enters the picture, a neighbour who is looking for Nick, but just decides to flirt with the stranger instead. After she leaves, he gets another knock, and its the goons of a local crime boss aptly named, The Boss (Morgan Freeman).After taking the smart-ass Slevin into their car in the bathrobe, and breaking his nose some more, he meets with The Boss, and is informed of a rather large debt Fisher owes. The Boss doesn't seem to care that Slevin is not Fisher, but offers him a way out of the debt, by killing the son of another crime boss, The Rabbi (Sir Ben Kingsley as he is credited in the credits). Slevin agrees, only to return home and be picked up by The Rabbi's boys. After he meets with The Rabbi, he finds out Fisher has another large debt to pay, and The Rabbi only gives him a few hours to get it to him.Still following? Need I even mention Bruce Willis' random hit-man character Mr. Goodkat who keeps popping around every corner, or Stanley Tucci's Detective Brikowski who is hot on the trail of Slevin? The film just seems to tie more and more characters to this one confusing plot line, and it seems like the addition of Liu was simply just to try and make sense of the whole thing, while proving as a mere somewhat good love interest for Hartnett.The film isn't too hard to follow, but as the story keeps rolling around and around to its conclusion where anything that seems a tad bit coincidental, or just does not seem clear, is completely crystal clear to that point that it becomes a little too clever for its own good. Things are all tied together (some for little to no reason), no plot point is left unturned (even the ones that make absolutely no sense until later, even then staying ludicrous), and in the end, it just becomes a nice tight little package. You cannot argue with this unfortunately, but for a movie like this, it ties the package way too tight. The film needs to breathe, and unfortunately, the film's plot line will not allow for it.If the substance is a little shifty, the style makes up for it. The cinematography is topnotch, and the colours are just fabulous. The film is totally anti-noir, but it takes the concept of film-noir, and adds colour to it. Sets are well photographed, and the costumes all match excellently. Hartnett's consistent nose injuries are also of note, as they contrast to the backgrounds wonderfully. The cast's main players are all very good, for as long or as small their roles are. The film's plot line may seem murky, but the dialogue is great. The delivery of the script's lines are all great, and all the witty smart ass quips are nailed to a tee (even though some of the conversations go around and around and around to the point of being like a conversation with David Caruso).It's not that Slevin is a bad movie. It's a great movie that is just too clever for it's own good. A little bit of touch-ups here and there to the plot would make the movie so much more better. It's an exercise in the reasoning of why tying everything up by the end, just does not always work.7.5/10.",7,5,15,14 April 2006
Requiem for a Dream," A haunting masterpiece of modern cinema
","Requiem for a Dream was almost six years old before I had a chance to watch it beginning to end. I had seen a few scenes from it on television before, but I'd never seen the entirety until a few days ago. What I thought would just be a standard 'good film', has turned out to be a merciless, haunting masterpiece, that leaves the viewer changed forever after viewing it.The film is a parallel story. It jumps between Harry's (Jared Leto) story about trying to score enough heroin with his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) to live out happy lives, and his mother Sara's (Ellen Burstyn) story about her desperate attempts to get onto television. The film chronicles these four individuals, and their ups and downs through the course of three seasons of a year.I have nothing but praise for this compelling and thought provoking film. It may be about junkies, but I'd be lying if I, who has never done hard drugs, said I could not relate to any of the characters. Each is played to perfection by their actor. Wayans performance is a total departure from his usual comedic roles, and is only a joy to watch some real acting chops being showcased by the young actor. Leto continues to impress me, and continues to prove why he'll be a heavy hitter in years to come. Connelly is excellent as always, shining through in a role that came just before her Oscar winning role in A Beautiful Mind. Burstyn is absolutely fabulous in her role, and clearly overshadows everything that won Julia Roberts her Oscar that year. Every supporting character, from Christopher McDonald's turn as infomercial king Tappy Tibbons to Keith David as the twisted Big Tim, to all the even lesser supporting characters, all are put to screen excellently and only complement the main actors.The writing is an absolute marvel. I cannot even begin to imagine what some of the sequences look like in Selby Jr.'s novel, but I can only come to think of them either being nowhere near as good as those created by Selby Jr and Aronofsky during the creation of the film. Watching some of the features on the DVD only helps to make the viewer feel more aware of all the planning and implementation that went into creating these gorgeous and appealing shots from the film. This is a Generation X film through and through, and the way it has been created only helps to make it more of a marvel six years later.But while the performances are all excellent, it's the style of the film that makes it absolutely unforgettable. Shots are all over the place. From crazy tracking shots, to shots of both characters view points, to the absolutely insane cuts all over the film, it all makes for a fantastic visual pleasure for the eyes. There are a few grainy scenes, but they only make the authenticity of other scenes become that much better. The cinematography and art direction are just astounding. Every piece of digital and normal camera work put into the film is put to the test here, and works magnificently in the final product. Not once does the editing falter, and not once do any of the visual elements not work. They all have been meticulously created to look and feel real, and they work as a result.This is just one of those films you cannot forget, and cannot keep your eyes off of after it starts. It is brilliant in every sense of the word, and deserved more praise than it ever got. The fact that it was nominated and lost its one Best Actress nomination is an absolute travesty. It is a visual treasure, and a true thought provoker. I was enthralled from the beginning to the end, and just cannot believe I waited so long to see it.Don't make the same mistake I did. See it now, before the opportunity evades you.10/10.",10,4,7,15 May 2006
United 93," A magnificent and harrowing film experience that is essential viewing for anyone
","Over five years after that horrific day, the world still is being influenced and changed as a result of 9/11. It was only a matter of time before a Hollywood studio would greenlight a film specifically about the event (instead of just letting scripts trickle in with blatant mentions of the event). And so, this year would be marked with two interesting takes on the event: one from veteran Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone, and one from relatively inexperienced British director Peter Greengrass. I have yet to see Stone's film, but as you can probably already tell, I was very impressed with Greengrass' film.Greengrass has done what most filmmakers and studios would almost never even dream of doing. He has written and directed a film with a cast of relatively unknown and/or inexperienced actors, to help dramatize the events that took place on September 11, 2001, in real time. Starting out on the terrorists preparations for the act, the film then transports us to the airport terminal and all of the characters either boarding or waiting to board Flight United 93 to San Francisco. What proceeds is a mix of footage from both the flight itself, and from the air traffic control stations at various airports across the United States.What makes this film so unique is the fact that besides a few phone calls and radio transmissions, there is really no hard facts about what exactly happened on Flight 93 that day. Greengrass has managed to use this fact to his advantage, and has written out a fictional basis of events based groundly in the actual known facts. While the set-up to the actual terrorist take-over of the plane is not exactly too exciting, the moments afterwards are absolutely fascinating to watch. Everything you may or may not have heard about happening on that plane plays out in truly dramatic fashion, and it strikes just the right chords at just the right moments. Seeing these almost completely unrecognizable actors give absolutely heartbreaking portrayals of these real life people is just that. You will be hard pressed to not feel like choking up as the film draws to its finale.And it is not only the passengers that shine. The actors portraying the terrorists are real, and are emotional beings. They are not the horrifying monsters that the American media have played them out to be. They have families at home, they are scared about the mission, they do not know whether or not they are making the right decisions. They are conflicted totally, and Greengrass and his flurry of actors allow this to play out magnificently on screen. In getting many of the actual military and airport personnel on duty that day to portray themselves, Greengrass stumbles slightly. While it gives the film a much larger push in means of realism, he also sacrifices these scenes to looking and acting amateur. You can almost pick out exactly who the actors are, and who is not. This is only a minor issue however, as it does not completely ruin the film at all. It just takes away from it at certain parts.The film has no big special effects, and relies heavily on the original CNN footage to showcase the sequences involving the planes crashing into the World Trade Center. The image has been played out far too many times for any of us to forget, so it was nice to see them not forcing themselves to have to redo the scene themselves for dramatic effect. The old footage is enough to allow the memories to flood back to us, and continues the dramatic feel of the picture. In fact, even with the recreated stuff, the film still strikes me as being realistic enough to feel as if these new items are not new at all. The plane itself, the air traffic control rooms, the costumes, even the food, look painstakingly recreated, and as a result, breathe total realism. Of course, the shaky and bizarre camera angles also allow for the viewer to feel as if you were standing right there on that fateful day. And if that does not make you any more emotional than the film already makes you, than there clearly is something wrong with you.I was not anticipating this film to be great at all. I was not in the camp of the film coming 'too soon', I just thought it seemed like a shameless cash-in that could have been spared for more original work.But now I realize that this bold work is in fact, quite original, and is frighteningly realistic to boot. Greengrass, while creating a controversial picture, has delivered a magnificent and harrowing film experience that just simply needs to be essential viewing for anyone who watches the cinema format, or just anyone in general. It may not be overly amazing, or have any real entertainment value, but the way it begins to absorb you and never let go is exactly what good cinema is. And of course, is the most we can ever ask from a filmgoing experience, entertaining or not.8/10.",8,1,2,12 September 2006
Star Trek," The legend returns with enough action and fun for fans and non-fans alike
","As much of a film geek and a science fiction fan as I am, I have never been a huge fan of Star Trek. I enjoyed the films I did see, I appreciated the legendary roles inhabited by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Patrick Stewart to name a few, and understood quite a fair bit about the mythology that took place since the 1960s. But when Paramount announced a reboot, with J.J. Abrams at the helm, I got fairly excited. And luckily, for good reason.Packed into a rather twisty and time shifty narrative, Star Trek details the lives of the most notable members of the U.S.S. Enterprise, and how they met and became a crew.Saying anything more would ruin the fun and the surprises Abrams and Co. have in store for fans and non-fans alike. From moment one, it is clear this is less of a film for Trekkers (or Trekkies, depending on how you feel about the title) and more of a film for everyone. Yes, there are stills terms and races of individuals that will baffle anyone not acquainted with Trek-lore, but screenwriters Abrams/Michael Bay-regulars Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman never exploit this. They ensure that everyone will be able to get some semblance of understanding from what is going on and what is being said. There are plenty of laughs as well, giving the film a more universal feel even as it becomes nerve-wreckingly tense. They leave just enough room to stay true to the original films and shows, while carving out their own identity as well.That idea inherently, is what makes this film work so well – it does not rely on everything that has come before to work now. Some purists may not appreciate the subtle and glaring changes the film makes to what has come before, but the film has the attitude of not caring and doing its own thing. There is enough originality and unique moments within the film that it is able to stand on its own. Yes, the original Spock (played again by Nimoy) is integral to the plot of the film, but he never gets in the way of the film being able to start up a new series, a new lore and a new generation of fans. Everything about this film feels like it has been treaded on before, but never like this. Everything old, feels new again. Even the special effects, so important to the series from the start, look incredible and more believable than anything we have ever seen in the franchise before. Anyone expecting something in the vein of what has been done before is going to be sadly disappointed.While I will not complain about the far too common lens flare that appears in an abundance of scenes, but the film does drag itself out in some cases. There is a lot to digest and a lot of characters to flesh out, but for a movie that starts off with the speed of a lightning bolt, it slows down a bit too much in the middle area of the film. It manages the rare challenge of remaining interesting throughout, but it feels like it spreads itself too thin in its midsection. While a lot of recent films seem to have trouble in their pacing, this film especially could have done with a few minor cuts.Despite having a relatively little-known but being fairly recognizable, the cast is excellent in their performances. Chris Pine has just enough arrogance, swagger and charm to embody the eventual Captain Kirk from his first appearance on-screen through the finale. He does not descend into the overacting and self parody of Shatner before him, but he is believable enough to be a younger version of the well-known character. Although known more for being a villain, Zachary Quinto manages to give a stunted and emotional performance as the near-emotionless Spock. He still has the gleam of a villain in his eyes, but he has enough power and gravitas in his performance, especially when we can easily compare him to the original and legendary Spock (credited as 'Spock Prime' in the end credits), that it is obvious he was born to fill the shoes.Zoe Saldana as Uhura, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov and Simon Pegg as Scotty, all put forth great work in their supporting performances, no matter how silly some of the material is (Yelchin's Russian accent is stretched a little too far, but is not overbearing). I would have liked a little more of Pegg, but he easily steals the majority of scenes he appears in. Karl Urban stands out among the supporting cast for his straight-laced and often hilarious rendition of Bones. I am not as familiar with the original character as most, but while everyone else is either being dead serious or as offbeat as they come, he gets the most time to just kick back and have fun with his lines and actions. One particular scene involving multiple diagnoses on Kirk is masterfully done by Urban, who despite being set back by a few cheesy lines, makes the performance as strong as any other. Eric Bana, as the Romulan villain Nero, gets a few seriously deadly moments on screen, but is not nearly as fleshed out as everyone else. We understand his motivations, and he appears on-screen frequently, but he just does not have the same spark as everyone else does.For only his second feature, and such a huge project, Abrams has delivered a fine product that is easily the first great film of 2009. The short delay only helped the picture become even better than it could have been. The cast is great, the story is well done, and the film is more fun than I ever imagined it could have been. Here's hoping for a great summer of film.8.5/10.",8,6,14,10 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," A fantastical, imperfect, unapologetic, and totally Tarantino period piece
","Inglourious Basterds really defies description. Like other films by Quentin Tarantino, the film revolves around a plethora of characters. There's the titular Basterds, a Jewish American gang of soldiers lead by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), who administer their own brand of justice to the Nazis they cross behind enemy lines. It also concerns Shoshanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), a Jewish survivor hiding out in Paris as a theatre owner. And at the same time, the film mainly revolves around Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), nicknamed 'The Jew Hunter' for his habit of rooting out the Jewish people in France for the S.S.Although Kill Bill was quite the bloody epic, Inglourious Basterds is his first true epic film in the sense of grandeur and scale. It is a fantastical period piece, combining his trademark dark humour, his great use of music, his adoration for homage and his love for blood soaked visuals. Make no mistake: this film is just as violent as every other film he has worked on. Look no further than when the 'Bear Jew' Sgt. Donnie Donowitz (Eli Roth) makes good on a promise to kill a German official with a baseball bat to know exactly what I mean. From the moment the film opens up, Tarantino truly makes us believe we are seeing his vision of Nazi-occupied France in the early 1940s. When we are not listening to long conversations or watching people get killed in ways only Tarantino could have imagined, you may find it hard to believe that the film is a Tarantino one. The cinematography, set and costume design is just so well done that it almost feels like an epic in the proper sense of things.But being a Tarantino movie, he turns that epic convention on its head and creates his most original work in years. While the man has always been of a different cut than most American filmmakers, Inglourious Basterds is unapologetically different from any other World War II film ever made. For one thing, Germans actually speak German, and the French speak French. Subtitles are almost non-existent in most war movies, and here they are on display for more than half the movie. Sure, there are a few historical inaccuracies, but the film relies on a style all its own. In more than a few instances, it is a historical epic that aims to tell the story of a large group of individuals in World War II era France. But then it also combines in the wit and bravura of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs to become something altogether different. It comes off as pure fantasy in some cases, but in others, it works to make it infinitely more watchable. I find myself hard pressed to think of a war film that ever looked or felt anything like this one did.What brings the film down, and has always been a problem for Tarantino, is how winded some of the conversations get. Going in, you know that the film will be a very talkative picture, but some scenes (especially one lengthy scene in a village bar) just go on far too long for their own good. He got the formula down perfectly in Pulp Fiction, but ever since, has had a lot of trouble with brevity in his speeches. Inglourious Basterds is no different, and sadly, drag the film out a bit longer than it should be. This film could have been a lean and mean epic that runs just over two hours; it does not need to feel like it is thirty minutes short of three. The exchanges are always entertaining, but you can easily spot where some cuts could have been made. I loved the dramatic tension in suspense in almost all of these scenes (especially the opening scene introducing us to Landa), but a bit of a chop here and there could have only made them look greater.What is immediately more impressive are the characters. Having such a diverse and large cast does lead to some characters being nowhere near as developed as others, but that seems to be okay for some.Pitt is quite good as Raine, bringing what is essentially a tailor-made Tarantino bad ass to life in a way he cannot always pull off. He felt like a more subdued version of Tyler Durdan, albeit a whole lot more sarcastic. He spends the majority of the film as an enigma, ordering the Basterds around but from an arm's length away. Roth on the other hand, dives headfirst into what is one of the most daft and twisted characters Tarantino has ever created. This is a true headcase, and Roth is clearly perverse enough to make the 'Bear Jew' work in ways that no one could (especially not Adam Sandler, who supposedly was the original actor up for the role). But sadly, none of the other Basterds really get a chance to shine (although all of them are good nonetheless), and even Pitt and Roth's work is sorely underwritten.The most fleshed out and most extraordinary work comes from the relatively European-centric Laurent and Waltz. Laurent is both subtle and heartbreaking in her role as a Jew continuing to hide from the Germans. Her work is just as powerful as it is devastating. With the exception of The Bride, she is Tarantino's most fully realized female character. Waltz on the other hand, is simply marvelous. He is the heart of the movie. While he is not as disgustingly evil as Roth, his devilish undertones and intense 'What comes next?' delivery is as nerve-wracking as it is frightening. His horrific atrocities go mostly unseen, but his eye-opening facial expressions are more than enough.Inglourious Basterds is flawed, but it is still a great effort on Tarantino's part. He reinvents himself in a way, and shows his maturity as a filmmaker. A touch less talking could have only improved the film.8/10.",8,3,12,21 August 2009
Iron Man 2," Downey Jr. and Rockwell are outstanding, but this sequel lacks the balance and energy of its predecessor
","Without a doubt, Iron Man was a total knockout when it was released in early 2008. It was an all around awesome movie that surprised just about everyone with how well made it was. Having Robert Downey Jr. sizzle in the lead role likely helped, as did the blend of action, thrills and laughs. It was a great start to the summer, and one of the few movies people remembered even came out that year after The Dark Knight was unleashed almost three months later. With hype running high on Iron Man 2, is there any way it could even possibly match up to the original film? The film opens with an interesting introduction to Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who does not appear to be much of a fan of Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Rather quickly, the film jumps a few months after Stark's announcement to the world that he is Iron Man. He has become an even bigger celebrity, has helped bring peace to a few warring nations, and the US government is hounding him to hand over the technology for military use. And that is just the start of his new set of problems to go along with his new public identity.While Iron Man was a fairly straight forward story with fairly little jumping, at times, Iron Man 2 feels like a convoluted mess. On top of Stark coming to terms with his new life and problems with long time friends and colleagues Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard), writer Justin Theroux throws in rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to turn up the heat alongside Rourke's Vanko, new 'assistant' Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) and a more fleshed out Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). While a movie like The Dark Knight was able to use its multitude of story lines to its advantage (with no small help to its longer running time), Iron Man 2 seems to have problems not too long after blasting through the starting gate.The multiple stories going on and weaving throughout the film are not bad, they just lack the interest and the drive the story at the heart of the original film had. At times, there is just so much going on that it becomes boring and feels like it is dragging the film out. I originally envisioned the added emphasis on S.H.I.E.L.D. and the first real push towards 2012's The Avengers would hinder the film, but at times, they are the most interesting things about it. Their mere mentions and initial origins feel more fleshed out, and more developed than half the ideas Theroux seems keen at throwing at the audience. They are the elements that stick, and despite having just come from the film, seem to be the only real integral things I can take from the film.Even worse is the character development. With the exception of Stark and Hammer, the rest of the cast gets very little time to really do much of anything. We get hints at how deadly an adversary Vanko is, but outside of a moderately thrilling sequence at a racetrack, we never really see how devastating he can be. Rushman is more of an enigma if anything, and seems to be here strictly to offer a tease for what may be a pivotal character in a later Marvel film. The chemistry between Potts and Stark is the only thing worthwhile thing Paltrow really gets to offer in the film, and Rhodes seems even more downplayed here than in the original film (even though Cheadle seems to be a much better fit for the character than Howard ever was). Spider-Man 3 had this same problem of adding too much to a good thing, so why did anyone think it would work out for the best here? But I digress. Downey Jr. was perfect the first time in the role as Stark, and looks even more at home in the role here. We really get to see the psychology and inner workings of the character more in this film, and Downey Jr. pulls it off with finesse over and over again. There are times where he looks like he should and wants to be doing more, but even at his most subdued, he is chewing up everything around him. He was born to play this role, and at no point does he ever seem to lose track of who the character is or how he should be played. At the same time, Rockwell knocks his role right out of the park. He plays Hammer with just the right amount of sleaze and sarcasm that he nearly steals the show in some sequences. He does great as the villain, and while some may be annoyed by his character, I could not get nearly enough.The effects are stellar across the board. I had heard some of them were not quite up to par, but I could not find any scene where I was not impressed by what was happening on screen. They are not perfect by any means, but the wow factor of the original film is still on display here. And thankfully, the extended ending battle scene for the most part more than makes up for the stilted and much too short battle from the original film's finale.Jon Favreau took a gamble on Iron Man and it paid off. For Iron Man 2, I think the gamble was a bit too much. I really enjoyed his extended performance as Happy Hogan, but the film just lacks the balance and the energy of the original film. There are some awesome sequences, and excellent performances from Downey Jr. and Rockwell. But as a cohesive whole, the film just feels like a bit of a disappointment. A decent disappointment, but a disappointment nonetheless.7/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",7,1,3,7 May 2010
The Hunger Games," The odds are in favour of the first must-see film of the year
","After months of endless hype and speculation, The Hunger Games are finally upon us. With fan anticipation running high, I managed to check out the Canadian premiere of the film a few days early. And I must say, I came out significantly more impressed than I ever imagined.Set in an unspecified future, one boy and one girl are randomly selected as tributes from each of the 'Districts' that make up the country known as Panem to take part in The Hunger Games – a televised battle to the death. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of District 12 volunteers in place of her younger sister to take part in the games. But survival will not come easy, especially when she faces 23 other individuals.I will confess, I initially thought The Hunger Games would be nothing more than a dolled up, Americanized version of the absolutely brilliant Battle Royale. Thankfully, it was everything but that. For Gary Ross has helped create a film that goes above and beyond a simple adaptation. This is a living, breathing, full blown phenomenon just waiting to break out. He hits the ground running after a brief explanation of the titular games, and makes the film more and more interesting as it trucks along. I hate that I will compare this film to Harry Potter and Twilight so often, but it does so much right that the first films in these franchises did wrong that you begin to wonder whether it is because of the source material, or because they just found the right filmmaker from the on-set to bring this epic story to life.Lawrence, an Oscar-nominee for Winter's Bone, proves her worth and undeniable talent as Katniss. She carries the film on her shoulders from the moment she enters the frame, and never looks back. You feel every breath, every tear, every ounce of struggle she goes through. We already knew she was an exceptional talent before, now we know she is a star and this was the role she was born to play. She is very in tune with this character, and never wavers; staying strong from beginning to end. While the young cast of Harry Potter and Twilight took 2-3 films to really find themselves, Lawrence already knows who this character is and how to play it. Granted she stays focused through the next two films, this could go down as one of the best character portrayals in film history. Whether she is on her own or interacting with the rest of the cast, you simply cannot take your eyes off her. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, the other half of District 12, does a fairly good job supporting Lawrence. There is a lot left unsaid about his character (although significantly more than Liam Hemsworth's Gale, who spends all too much of his screen time brooding and looking longingly into the distance), but he is more than up to the task of showing off the skills he has been praying would make him a star for the better part of the decade. He does a lot of the emotional lifting in the film, giving his best work to date. He even helps make the more love-centric aspects of the story not feel nearly as dragged out as they seem to be. While the young leads are all great, I found myself most fascinated by the supporting cast of adult character actors like Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Wes Bentley, and especially Stanley Tucci. All of them are sadly underused, but are all incredible additions when they do pop on screen. I just wish it was more often.But what holds The Hunger Games back from perfection is its distinct lack of flavor or personality. The film moves at a wildly chaotic pace, barely slowing down for character or story development. It just moves from beat to beat, to the point where you can sense the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. And in this chaos, you never get a sense of what style Ross wants to infuse the film with. It has all the elements it needs to be a dystopian masterpiece or even a poignant and subtle social satire (ideas I already know will be developed in the future films), but it never quite gels together the way it should. It thrills you, but at the same time leaves you incredibly empty. I am not sure if this is how the book reads, or even if this was Ross' intention. Is he holding back on purpose, or is someone pulling strings to make sure the film does not truly become its own thing? I feel like I may be getting to the point of nitpicking (I will leave out my reservations about how shoddy some of the shots involving fire looked), but days later, I still feel like the film is missing that one crucial element that separates it from being a simply book-to-film adaptation and the truly wonderful epic it should rightfully be. While it may not be perfect, I cannot help but applaud The Hunger Games. This is the best first book-to-film adaptation since The Fellowship of the Ring, and did exactly what I secretly hoped it would – made me want to read the books as fast as humanly possible to find out what happens next. While it hints at oh so much of more, the film gives you just enough to stay riveting throughout. Lawrence cements her status as someone to watch out for, while Hutcherson and Hemsworth should brace for stardom. With Harry Potter an all but distant memory, and Twilight hopefully fading into obscurity, it's nice to know we have a series we can actually look forward to continuing. Bring on Catching Fire!8/10.",8,8,26,21 March 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Alright, but feels held back by a few inconsistencies
","I checked out the midnight screening of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest with mixed anticipation. I had thoroughly enjoyed the first film, and seriously consider it as one of the most recently released films that actually felt like it was made just to be fun. It was an obvious risky gamble as a film, and it paid off for Disney. As could be expected, two sequels were greenlit, and filmed back-to-back. And as one of the key highly anticipated films of the summer, it has some mighty shoes to fill. And understandably, there are mixed results.Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightely) are about to get married. Unfortunately, the newly appointed Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) has other plans. They are placed under arrest for aiding and abetting felon Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), and are told that their penalty will be death. Meanwhile, Jack, after a great intro, is informed that he has to pay an owed debt to Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), and is now a marked man.Revealing anything else would just give away some of the intriguing subplots, and the useless boring ones. Some elements felt a bit half-baked, but of course, will sound and feel a lot more developed come At World's End next summer. The script seems fairly well formulated, but it feels like they went heavy on story here, and cut back on the comedy and action that made the first film so much fun. There is plenty of it to go around of course, but it just feels totally lessened down in comparison to the first film. Another element missing here is a lack of character development. A few crazy developments do happen, but the characters really do not change at all throughout the film. Again, something that may be fixed in the next film, but nonetheless feels awkward here. One thing they did not bother changing from the first film was the intensely long running time. In fact, it's even longer. The editing feels a lot sharper as opposed to the original film, but there is still quite a bit of dialogue and useless add-ons that could have been excised.Although not at the forefront of attention this time around, Depp still has the right amount of flavour to pull off Jack Sparrow. His performance in the original film was flawless, and he just continues his fabulous Oscar-nominated role here. As said though, he does take more of a supporting role here as opposed to Bloom and Knightely. Bloom does great again as Will Turner, and while nowhere near as stunningly superb as Depp, he puts in another fine performance for what is arguably his short career's best character. Knightely is alright here, but she looks and feels a bit distracted for the most part. She does not have the genuine independence or the spunk that her character had in the original film. Her character instead feels a lot more static and uneven in comparison to the other two.Jack Davenport pulls in a great continued supporting turn as the conniving Norrington, as does Kevin McNally as first mate Gibbs. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook, although they could have done with a little bit less screen time, do great as the comedic pirate duo of Pintel and Ragetti. They were shining parts in the original film, and despite feeling overused, do very well here too. And although they only skimmed the surface of their characters, Nighy's Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgård's 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (who was only mentioned briefly in the original film) are great additions to the cast. The only thing they would have benefited from, was more screen time. I can only hope they get extended and more developed in part three. Other characters like Hollander's Lord Cutler Beckett and Naomie Harris' Tia Dalma are almost totally unreviewable, as they get even less screen time, and are given nothing but plot advancement/surprise revealing to do.The music, while featuring a few recycled/redone tunes, is just as great the second time as it was the first. The depth and feel of it only complements the film. The costumes, set designs and makeup also continue to be well done. Their authenticity adds greatly to the film.And even with their unevenness, the special effects dazzle. Davey Jones and his crew look absolutely phenomenal. Watch them in battle scenes and they look just as awestriking, if not more so, than the skeleton pirates in the original film. A particular standout for me was watching Davey Jones play the piano with all of his tentacles. It looks so realistic, and is done so well that it looks absolutely flawless on screen. However, the Kraken (a giant octopus that can be summoned at will) just does not look anywhere near as good. His tentacles, as they come around on the various ships, look fairly well done, but look weak when they attack any member of the cast. And when they do show anything more than just his tentacles, the effects look totally off, and feel inadequate in comparison to the great effects used for Jones and Co.In the end, the film really is a mixed bag. It does have many inconsistencies and a lack of completion, but it is watchable. The original film is obviously better, but at least this does not feel totally rushed and ill-managed. I can only hope that they fix up the loose ends in the screenplay, clean up the effects and get a better editor for the next round though. Otherwise, this really is going to be a one-trick pony of a franchise. 6/10.",6,4,8,7 July 2006
Hostel," So what's so horrific about it?
","A day after watching Hostel I still cannot help but ask myself, where was the horror? Because besides a small five minute scene, which was not all too terrifying, I cannot for the life of me, understand why anyone would define this as a horror movie. It's not, it's just silly throw-away trash.The plot, as most of us who have read anything about it know, is that three guys, two Americans and an Icelandic guy they meet up with, are in Europe looking to sleep with lots of women. Does not seem to matter, as long as they have a pair of breasts and a nice ass, they are there. So upon finding out that there are all sorts of women doing anything in Bratislava, the three of them go, only to find the women of their dreams, and the stuff from their nightmares.To define the movie into certain parts, it goes from thirty minutes of sex, breasts, alcohol and drugs, to ten minutes of a thriller, to the rest of the movie trying to be horrific (along with film noir and comedy elements thrown in for good measure), but failing mindlessly. People are brought in, and leave way too soon, either by dying or just by not coming back. None of the relationships or motivations are explained at all. The actors look like walking, swearing zombies. No character, even the sympathetic Jay Hernedez, is the least bit likable. Everyone is a jerk. And to top it all off, there is virtually no good dialogue in the film at all. And for some ungodly reason, there are way too many homosexual overtones at every turn this movie attempts to take, that you begin to feel that the characters should be wearing cowboy hats and making Brokeback Mountain with torture and murderous mayhem instead.When the whole idea of what is going on, and why all of these people are being tortured and killed actually begins to make some sort of sense, you are just left stunned trying to understand how ludicrous the idea is. And after you realize who the lead bad guy is, you still do not get a real sense as to why any of this is actually happening. It only becomes even more ridiculous than it was before hand. It all just seems like heinous and horribly random acts of violence put forth in order to try and achieve some sort of scareful momentum. But the movie fails to deliver it.But Eli Roth's problem is like every other modern horror director. He shows lots of blood, but does not push the envelope. There is nothing new here, and any methods that may seem 'new' are either not brought to their full potential, or just do not seem to make sense at all. There is quite a bit of blood spilled throughout the film, but its nowhere near as sick or vomit-inducing as this movie was hyped up to be. Instead, it comes off as a hyper-violent disappointment that some campy fans may be into, but traditional horror fans will see right through. He may claim to be trying, but this is really far from. Even Saw, which the movie is border line ripping off, seemed a lot more frightening than this film. And it had three times less blood, and just as bad acting.I have yet to see all of Cabin Fever, but even with the small parts of that movie and the entirety of this movie, I really get a feel that Roth thinks he is being clever, and does not realize that the audience is not as gullible as he thinks. If he's going to make a horror movie, he should make it. If he wants to make a comedy, he should make it. If he wants to make a porno, than he should make it. A film noir? A revenge tale? Merging all of these into one incohesive narrative is definitely not the way to go. It may work for Tarantino, but is does not work for Roth.Take a lesson Eli.Write good dialogue, make characters likable, and add some horror.And for god sake, let the movie make sense.You do not horrify the audience with your images, you horrify them with your horrendous way of putting the movie together and claiming it to be a horror film.3/10.",3,2,4,1 May 2006
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Bittersweet, emotionally uplifting and distinctly hilarious
","Crazy, Stupid, Love. is one of, if not the best, American romantic comedies of the past decade. This may come as a shock to some (as it surely took me aback) but there is no other way to describe it. Going into an advanced screening of the film earlier this week, I had my doubts that it would be anything outside of generic. But instead of tripe, I got one of the most unexpected surprises I have seen all year.Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) have hit a rough patch in their long-time marriage, and Emily inadvertently announces to an entire restaurant that she wants a divorce. Down and depressed, Cal starts drinking away his sorrows at a local bar, attempting to make sense of his predicament with anyone who will listen. Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a professional bachelor, takes notice and makes it his personal mission to help Cal get over his wife, and become a new man in the process.But this is just the main plot thread of the movie. It also follows Jacob's relationship with the absolutely stunning Hannah (Emma Stone), throws in a bit of curveball with Emily being romanced by David (Kevin Bacon), and even has a bit of a focus on Cal's son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) pining over his older babysitter Jessica (Analeigh Tipton). It may sound a little packed with threads and too many characters, but Crazy, Stupid, Love. is able to navigate between each character and couple with ease. It reminded me a lot of Valentine's Day, and how its main goal was to depict how different love is for a sizable amount of couples and singletons. Except it failed miserably at it, and stood out more as an example of every rom-com stereotype you could imagine. Thankfully, Crazy, Stupid, Love. takes the higher road and breathes new life into a stale genre.While the impeccable cast is more than enough reason why the film succeeds so well in being an atypical film in the genre, it is the crew behind-the-scenes that surprises even more. The film is written by Dan Fogelman, who is best known for a string of Disney films and the atrocious Fred Claus, and is directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who wrote and directed the sadly little seen I Love You Phillip Morris and wrote the now classic Bad Santa. These three would not be the first group on men I would turn to for a film like this, but their relative lack of expertise helps propel the film to the heights it reaches. It takes darkly hilarious turns in certain instances, plays other sequences totally unconventionally, play even more out with a foreboding sense of drama the trailer merely hints at, and trumps more than its share of genre stereotypes. Weaving between the plots lines, they make the film feel unique and different from others, all while giving it an aura of authenticity. While they stumble a bit in the final act with a series of sitcom-like shockers that border on ludicrous, they manage to pull off the rare feat of actually making the audience wonder if these characters will all end up together in the end, or if they will walk their separate ways; something that is truly uncommon for this genre.Acting wise, the film delivers in spades. Carell gives one of his best performances to date as Cal, moving as swiftly as the script requires between depression and humiliation, and touching and hilarious. The film stretches his dramatic muscle more than most, and allows him to give a performance that does not rely on laughs. The expressions on his face are just devastating in some sequences, and the wonder in other scenes is ridiculously hilarious. It is a performance I hope to see him come back to again, and make even better. Gosling plays against type, and gives an absolutely hysterical performance. He shines brightly in every scene, nailing every line and mannerism, while making this scumbag of a lothario become someone to really care about. He exudes chemistry and helps make everyone else's performance better. Moore and Stone also give great performances, easily balancing the humour with the drama. They are not given nearly as much to do as the guys, but hold their own on- screen.The supporting cast does even better. Bobo is phenomenal in his role, conveying an innocence and naivety that is more mature than I thought possible. He acts like more of an adult than some of the older cast does in many instances, and gives the performance a well-rounded other young actors would be incapable of. Tipton is not nearly as good, but plays the role of a confused teenager a little better than you would imagine. Bacon does great in a small turn as does Liza Lapira as Hannah's best friend. But it is Marisa Tomei who steals the show from everyone, playing one of Cal's conquests. She is dementedly unhinged and ridiculously over-the-top, but never falters. Her performance may be one-note, but it is easily the most memorable thing about the film.If I hold anything against the film (other than the final act stumble and the oh-so convenient way one particular scene comes together), it is that it ended. I know I have harped on how unlike other typical romantic comedies Crazy, Stupid, Love. is, but there is really no other way I can rave about it. I easily could have spent more time with these characters, and pined to find out what happened to each of them after the final fade out. The incredibly unlikely pair of Ficarra and Requa has crafted a truly wonderful and hilarious film that is nothing like what you could have expected watching the trailer. It is bittersweet, and easily one of my favourite movies of the summer. And this is coming from someone who loathes almost every single romantic comedy ever conceived.8.5/10.",8,302,385,16 July 2011
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Good, but not quite as good as the original
","While not being anywhere on par with its predecessor, this sequel tries its best at being a separate entity from the original film, while still remaining true to its original roots.Whereas the original was about 3 unconventional prehistoric animals teamed up to bring a little girl back to her family safely, this film is about those same animals fighting to survive during global warming, along with a few new characters. While the political agenda is almost blatant (global warming is bad!), the film still does not reek of being all about politics. The jokes are amusing in small doses, and some of the more adult fare does hit the mark pretty high, but a lot of the material included within the film is geared right at kids.The storyline is pretty good, albeit not as good as the original. Both do not pack anything but an entirely simple storyline, but here they added a lot of things going on in the background, from a fear of swimming, to a love story, to just random things Scrat is doing, that all of it ends up not flowing together in many sequences. The scenes are just kinda, there, and have zero substance to start, and only have a bit after it becomes more clearer why that scene is in it. The way-too-short run time affects this, in that all of it gets tied up in less than 90 minutes, and you just do not feel as satisfied as you could be with the final product. It's not a bad movie, but it's one that could have been better developed.The original voice talent of Ramano, Leary and Leguizamo are back, and while Leary gets very little screen time, they all still have the chemistry that worked 4 years ago, and its enjoyable to see them redoing their roles again, and still being the same. The new talent, from Seann William Scott and Josh Peck as two wise-ass possums, to Jay Leno as a crazy panhandling turtle-thing, to Queen Latifah as a female mammoth, they all come off as pretty well-done. I'm getting a little sick of all the films Latifah has been in lately, but here's something where her obnoxious attitude and physical demeanor do not shine through into the role.The CGI animation is clearly the standout of the film. While some scenes look hand-drawn (whether for effect, or just as crappy CGI), others are fantastic. Watching Manny in the water, and then seeing his soaked fur is a visual amazement for the eyes. And with all the trouble that Scrat (the trailer/poster boy of both films) gets into, it all turns into a visual feast. As said however, there are scenes that looked pretty horrible, and others that just did not seem quite as picture-esquire as the rest of the film. Another month or so in the animation department at Blue Sky probably could have fixed this.A key problem I had was the fact that Scrat takes up about 15 minutes of the less than 90 minute movie, and most of his scenes are in the trailers. Like I understand that movies are given away in the trailers, but whole sequences? Isn't that just overdoing it a tiny bit? I realize the character's purpose and his design, but it just takes away even more from the final product.Like so many sequels these days, Ice Age: The Meltdown is not perfect. While not being anywhere near as horribly half-baked as some recent sequels, this film does make a valiant attempt at being different and/or even better than the original film. It just does not to come to live to its fullest manageable potential by the end of the film.But for a light laugh, I can't see why anyone wouldn't be able to enjoy it.7.5/10.",7,13,23,2 April 2006
Oldboy," A total surprise...in a good way.
","A complete surprise for me.I had heard lots of praise and acclaim for this film, and decided I needed to watch it. I had imagined a revengeful bloodbath in similar style to Kill Bill, but was pleasantly surprised to find very little bloodbath, but a whole lot of heart and storyline instead.The idea of trapping someone in a cell for 15 years, and then letting them out, is quite original for its time, and its execution is just something to marvel. The cinematography and editing is fantastic, as is the entire visual scope of the film. The writing is superb, with many laughable moments coming to break the silence of the hugely dramatic moments. The much talked-about one-take fight scene in the hallway is something that will be remembered and ripped-off for years to come, as was the lobby scene in the first Matrix film.The acting is excellent for everyone, especially the main character. His broken heart, and troubled mind lead to plenty of excellent sequences, as is his female co-star.If I have anything bad to say, its that the movie goes on a bit long, and there should have been a bit more fleshed out of the past and why he was imprisoned without reason, just so the entire scope of the final act of the film doesn't hit you like a ton of bricks. Yes, it was probably meant to be like that, but there were more than a few scenes that could have been changed or replaced just to make the whole thing flow a touch better.And just for the record, I can't even begin to imagine how they are going to pull off an American remake.8/10.",8,8,85,17 February 2006
127 Hours," An emotional and unforgettable experience
","Despite having the opportunity to see Darren Aronofsky's absolutely extraordinary masterpiece Black Swan at this year's past Toronto International Film Festival, I did regret missing out on Danny Boyle's 127 Hours. The film was one of the few to emerge from the festival with momentous Oscar buzz, and even a bit of controversy over a specific scene late in the film that was causing people to faint in theatres.The film chronicles the true story of Aron Ralston (James Franco), a recklessly arrogant mountain climber whose arm gets crushed under a boulder during a trip through Utah canyon country. With no one coming to save him, he must decide whether he will die or fight for survival.The logline and description may not sound like much, but 127 Hours delivers one of the most riveting and incredibly emotional experiences I have had in a theatre in some time. I was unsure Boyle and his crew could top their Oscar-winning work in Slumdog Millionaire, but this film improves upon it in every way possible. Because of all the talk about 'the scene', the majority of people will know how the film ends well before they even consider seeing it. But everything leading up to Aron's life-altering decision is absolutely amazing and the stuff of pure filmmaking magic.From the very beginning up until the very end, you know you are in the hands of some truly special filmmakers, specifically Boyle. Everything in the film seems to have a pulse and a life of its own, whether it is the hyper kinetic editing, the lush and gorgeous cinematography, the often epic score, the thought-provoking writing or just the general style of the film. Where other movies pay very little attention to the little things, Boyle and company seem to have amped up the quality in the majority of those areas, and made a film whose elements very much complement each other. I could not believe the short running time at first, but they pack so much in and the film moves at such an aggressively energetic pace, that you barely have time to slow down and breathe once the film really gets moving.One of the unique things that really stood out for me was the use of flashback throughout the film. Ralston spends a lot of time thinking about what brought him to this life changing moment, and it is rather interesting how Boyle handles these thoughts. They act specifically as our way into Ralston's life and his character dynamic, but they never seem to overtake the bigger picture of his being pinned by the rock. They work rather brilliantly as asides, as mere stylishly and crazily edited set pieces (a naked party in the back of an SUV is a particular standout). They are among the film's few scenes of character interaction, and help the audience adjust deeper and deeper into Ralston's mindset. It aids the film in being an even greater experience of authenticity. His hallucinations are done in very much the same way, but do not work nearly as great as these off-the-wall scenes do.The lengthy cast list may not suggest it, but the film is really just the James Franco show. We only get fleeting and stylishly edited glimpses of him at first, but after the boulder comes down, the film becomes a deeply focused, claustrophobic and devastatingly candid character piece driven almost exclusively by facial movements and reactions. 2010 has been a year of transformations by actors, and Franco's turn as Ralston is no different. The camera gets right in his face and shows us the gritty reality of his predicament, and Franco is eerily authentic in his portrayal. You can see the gradual exhaustion and desperation taking its toll on him; you can see the visible fear on his face as he faces life or death. Not many actors are able to drive a film by mainly interacting with themselves and the static objects around them, but Franco delivers in spades at every turn. Whether he is being devastatingly hilarious or dead serious, he still manages to ensure the realism and intensity of his performance never changes. You will be unable to take your eyes off this riveting portrayal at any time.While it pains me to have to point out the film's small amount of imperfections (even with the attention to detail), it is only because I cannot wrap my head around the film being absolutely flawless. This is an incredible piece of cinema, but there are a few special effects, musical and editing choices made that are simply baffling. I understand the point and logistical ideas around some of them, but some just stand out as odd. Why point out the insects that inhabit Ralston's surroundings, and then make them so CGI'ed that they look visibly fake? Why throw in the out of place tunes to help try and convey his emotions? I know I am pulling at strings, but there were at least a handful of elements that seemed out of place and made the film slightly less than perfect. It just seems these extra steps easily could have been made to make the film even more pristine.127 Hours is not just a film â€“ it is an experience. It is only in limited release now, but I can only hope that audiences everywhere will get the opportunity to see the movie. It is an amazing movie centred around an absolutely incredible, legendary performance. Watching Franco bare his soul on-screen is practically a cleansing experience. I went in with high hopes, and left with a huge smile on my face. It is authentically emotional, and in a year merely punctuated with a handful of amazing movies amongst a sea of filth, it more than just stands out. It is quite simply, unforgettable.9.5/10.",9,197,264,21 November 2010
"I Love You, Man"," Utterly hilarious in some areas, but could have been a lot better
","Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) proposes to his girlfriend Zooey (Rashida Jones), and rather romantically, has everything already set up for the wedding. Zooey is obviously excited, and so are her girlfriends. But Peter seems to not take into account that he has no real guy friends, and thus, would be forced to stand at the front of the aisle with basically no one by his side. So, he searches for a best friend, and eventually finds Sydney Fife (Jason Segal). Only things do not stay as swimmingly as imagined.From the trailers, I Love You, Man looks like a surefire comedic hit. I practically sprang at the chance of seeing an advance screening of it for this very reason. And for the majority of the movie, it really is as funny as it looks.Rudd and Segal, Judd Apatow regulars, are hilarious acting together and apart (the former obviously working even better than the latter). Both have a great sense of comedic timing, and give their characters a surprising amount of depth. They are given the bare minimum of development throughout the film, but both breathe just enough life into the characters that they easily make them memorable. These two roles could have easily been filled by just about anyone, but they work and make the audience care because of who plays them.Rudd seems a little too old for his awkward role here, and it really shows in some of the scenes where he clearly looks like he should be younger. But nonetheless, he gives the character a such a unique voice that this fact is a little easy to overlook. Much the same goes for Segal, who walks all over Rudd in a lot of scenes. He is clearly the funnier of the two, but he manages to bring the best out of both of them. Even in the most ridiculous of scenes, Segal delivers in spades.But unfortunately, the film would have very little going for it if these two were not in it. Apatow may not be involved, but it feels like it was ripped straight from his book of tricks. Sure, dirty and offensive jokes are in right now (and thankfully are not toned down in the least), but it feels a little too close to the man than it should. Many of the jokes work, and hit the mark, but some fall so flat it hurts. It is a real shame that there are such stale moments in the film, but it just never tries to amend any of its wrongs. It practically just allows itself to revel in them.What also does not help is the film being entirely predictable. Leaving aside just how much of the film is given away in the trailers and TV spots, the film practically plays like a paint-by-numbers of recent comedies. Yes, it has the high-concept of being one of the first real bromantic comedies, and turns an age old cliché on its head (while only sidestepping into homosexual elements for actual comedy as opposed to doing so just for the sake of it). But it only uses this concept when it wants to. It feels like it wants to branch out, and really make something original of itself (why else throw in a random subplot involving Lou Ferrigno?), but ends up being held back by the constraints of wanting to play out to the Apatowian audience.Much like other Apatow films, the film also feels a bit too long. I do not understand why the man seems to have patented this idea, but it makes for some really irritating moments in otherwise superlative movies. I Love You, Man is no different. There is a huge gap in the film that continues to be funny, but just feels unwarranted. It is almost to the point of dragging itself out just to make the running time a pinch longer. And the inevitably Unrated DVD/Blu-ray is not going to help this dilemma out either.The film also falters in its treatment of the female characters. Jones has some genuinely hilarious lines sprinkled throughout the film, as do Sarah Burns and Jaime Pressly. There are some really funny exchanges between the three, but the film never seems to take advantage of the potential comic goldmine these three develop between each other. It instead seems content with amping up the interactions between Rudd and Segal, and only giving us minute doses of the other three. It is a real shame, but the material we do get is much funnier than I imagined it would be.Much the same goes for the supporting cast, headed up by Andy Samberg, J.K. Simmons, Jane Curtin, Thomas Lennon and especially, Jon Favreau. All five of these actors get to deliver some hilarious dialogue. I was almost in pain from how hard I was laughing at some of the things these guys say and do in the film. They each get a moment or two that practically steals the film from Rudd and Segal. But unfortunately, they also seem to be very undercut (especially Simmons and Curtin) in the general course of things. I realize I thought the running time was a bit too long, but it could have been a bit better swallowed had the filmmakers used more material from this incredible supporting cast. Here's hoping they get more time to shine on the DVD/Blu-ray.I really wanted to like I Love You, Man, but it is hindered by so many things that it only mildly delivers on the promises of the trailers. When it works, it is practically on fire from being so funny. But when it falls flat, it falls hard. There is so much more that this film could have done with itself, but it seems content with simply being average.7/10.",7,6,16,12 March 2009
Superbad," An accurately vulgar and hysterical representation of high school woes
","After being disappointed by Knocked Up (only in terms of it not completely living up to the legacy I built up for The 40-Year-Old Virgin), I was a little hesitant to get as hyped up for Superbad. Yes, it looked downright hysterical, and yes, everywhere I looked someone was praising it for its comedic excellence. So rather than prep for another disappointment, I held hopes up at a moderate level (and excitement to see it even higher), and I came out finding what is probably the funniest comedy since Virgin.Superbad tells the story of Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera). Both are in their dying days of high school, and have been best friends for as long as they can remember. With change on the horizon for both of them, they look to make the best of things, and attempt to make something of themselves with the girls they have been pining for. After hearing that Jules (Emma Stone) is planning a party for that very night, Seth and Evan are thrown into a day-long odyssey that will test more than just a few of their limits.Yes, it does sound like every other high school comedy with the average kids wanting to lose their virginity before the inevitable trip to college, but there is something sweet and endearing at play here as opposed to the typical comedies of the American Pie form (and just about every 1980's sex comedy). Even though the characterization of anyone other than Seth, Evan and their sometimes friend Fogell (newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the one you may know as McLovin) is very one-dimensional, the film gets across the needed messages about friendship and morality. Yes, the trailer may suggest just one long party of a movie without any embedded implications or significances, but when it comes down to it, there is a certain maturity that runs through the movie that is completely lacking in any typical high school related comedy (exceptions including Dazed and Confused, Rebel Without a Cause, the heavily overrated American Graffiti, The Breakfast Club, Fast Times at Ridgemont High and not too many others). It helps itself to overcome the borders of the genre, and truly plunge itself into 'instant classic' territory.What also sets it apart is the genuine authenticity of it all. Anyone who was not the most popular kid in high school can identify with the anxieties and desires of these characters, and if you were anything like me, can probably see a bit of themselves in them as well. Even when the film borders on being beyond raunchy, it still breathes an aura of reality and accuracy that is almost completely missing from the commonality of the genre.What it does not share with those other mature offerings is its vulgar and witty attitude that runs non-stop throughout the film. For any Virgin or Knocked Up fan, you will be right at home with the vivaciously crude dialogue. And much like that movie, even the most offensive of jokes comes off as downright hysterical. There is not one moment in the film where I had more than a few moments to collect myself before laughing again. The punches come furiously, and often, within only mere seconds of each other. Whole pieces of dialogue flew by without me catching them because just about everyone was laughing too hard. Even at it's most genuinely passive or dramatic moments, the jokes keep flying out, and never seem to stop. And much like those two films, you will be quoting the movie endlessly right after watching it. I was a little frustrated with the fact that some of the very best lines in the movie were already in the trailer (and even more in the R-rated trailer), but thankfully there was plenty left just for the film.What the film also shares with those Judd Apatow-produced productions is the general feeling of clunkiness right in-between the second and third acts. I noticed it after watching the Unrated Virgin, noticed it almost blatantly while watching Knocked Up, and noticed it rather subtly here. They all seem to share the problem that there needs to be a lull between these two acts where nothing seems to happen, and the whole film slows down as a result of it. Granted, it is far shorter an amount of time here than it was in the almost draggy Knocked Up, but it is here nonetheless, and takes away from the lasting effect of the film. Thankfully, the jokes continue to pop up during this time, so not everyone should get bored or antsy waiting for the movie to finally continue moving.Acting wise, the film is solid. Hill and Cera play off each other brilliantly, and while they are not quite the odd couple, they do make a great mismatched pair. They handle the most lewd pieces of dialogue with class, and handle the deeply meaningful scenes so subtly that you can barely notice the fact that these kids are swearing at breakneck pace. Mintz-Plasse, although nowhere near as crafty as either of them, practically steals many of the scenes he is in. He has a very obvious easiness with the material, and I can see this guy becoming another potential wonder of the Apatow crew (granted he can overcome his almost instant cult stardom).Supporting turns from Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as two unorthodox police officers weaving in and out of the boys' odyssey are fairly well done, if not slightly stretched out too far. I liked what they brought to the film, but I think they should have been in it a little less.Despite a few minor problems, Superbad is the comedy of the summer, and possibly the best comedy since The 40-Year-Old Virgin. And even with its unrestrained dialogue, it can successfully enter among the greats as being one of the most legitimate depictions of life in high school.9/10.",9,1,7,20 August 2007
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Rushed, silly and all-around disappointing
","Despite the unoriginality of the title, X-Men Origins: Wolverine accomplishes what few titles do: it acknowledges the main character in the film (as played again by Hugh Jackman), and tells the audience exactly what it is going to be about – the origin of Wolverine. Crisscrossing around timelines before settling on one undisclosed period before the first X-Men film, Wolverine chronicles how James Logan got his adamantium skeletal frame, how his relationship with Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber) began, and everything in-between.While my small amount of knowledge in regards to X-Men lore is not as vast as others, I had an idea of what to expect from the film story-wise. And while it deviates from the comics in some rather large areas, other parts are fairly true to them.But in adapting this story to film, the filmmakers stumble right out of the gate. The storyline, as fantastical as it is, descends into silliness and absurdity faster than Wolverine can bring out his claws. I understand the material is based off of a comic franchise, but the filmmakers take this for granted. Instead of fleshing out a jumpy origin story, the film rushes from one point to the next, throwing dialogue and characters at the audience that people will either understand or be completely thrown off by. It takes the time to really make you understand the bond between Wolverine and Sabretooth, but then never makes any of the motivations of anyone else clear. There is so much going on here, and so little explanation that it is a miracle any of this came together at all. The whole film hinges on explaining Wolverine's origins, and what lead him to the gang in X-Men, but the film feels incomplete – like something integral is missing.The X-Men series has always been about a group of people, and this film is no different. But whereas the other films had strong supporting casts backing up the main individuals, this film lacks any good supporting characters. Characters played by Dominic Monaghan, Kevin Durand, Will i Am and Daniel Henney are given so little to do that they could have been played by special effects. Each is given something to do, but so little is done to make them more than one-note that it is a wonder why they are even here in the first place. Other characters, played by the likes of Lynn Collins, the horrendously miscast Taylor Kitsch (who needs accent lessons) and Ryan Reynolds (in another stereotypical wise-ass role) are integral to the film, but have no time to really prove themselves as being useful to the film. They merely stand as plot devices, and items that the like of Jackman and Schreiber use to move from point A to point B. They have a point, but the filmmakers care less in giving them any real motivations or emotions. If they do not care, then why should an audience? If the story and the acting were a bit out of touch, the CGI fares even worse. In some scenes, it looks just fantastic and smoothly developed. In others, it looks fake and rushed. The bootleg copy of the film that circulated online before the movie opened apparently had very little special effects in place. That came out a month ago. Was that the working version of the film at that point, and everything else has been added in since? It would make sense for how patchy of a job some scenes look and how incredibly horrendous others look. Even simple scenes involving Wolverine's claws, which should look quite realistic by this point four films in, look horrible. Even the makeup effects (especially for one key character) are laughably bad. I know the film had its problems on-set and in post-production, but there is no excuse anyone could make for how bad some scenes look. When dated films from years past look better than something current, I think there is a problem.The villains played by Schreiber and Danny Huston are the most interesting part of the film. While not as key to the film as Wolverine himself, both deliver excellent performances that belong in better movies. Huston is deliciously evil as always, using his face to hint at ulterior motives while saying something else entirely. Schreiber gives a level of depth and ferocity that was totally missing from Tyler Mane's original performance in the first film. The animal of a man Schreiber becomes is nothing short of excellent. Both actors take the film seriously, even at its most ridiculous moments, and they make something of their roles that none of the supporting cast really attempts. Perhaps their scenes were not as cut up as others, but watching them act alongside anyone is proof that there is some form of a good movie buried deep within X-Men Origins: Wolverine.But the real strength of the film belongs to Jackman. He nails everything about Wolverine from his attitudes, to his mannerisms, to his behaviours. This is his most physical portrayal of the character, and it works the best because of how concrete and involved Jackman is. He knows this character, and never once does he leave him. He never falters. He dives headfirst into every scene he is in, and he gives it every single one the same amount of depth and complexity to make the character a real entity. This is not just a simple comic book character. We can see the layers of emotion, and the scarring this character goes through.I was not expecting a lot from X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but I got even less than I wanted. The film feels too rushed, too silly to truly be what was originally envisioned for this film. Jackman, Schreiber and Huston all make it work, and make it watchable because they genuinely try; even with the often horrendous material they are given. I just hope this is not the beginning of a lousy summer.6/10.",6,31,66,1 May 2009
Alexander," Alexander: Director's Cut is not all that bad.
","So I finished Alexander: Director's Cut today. And yeah, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.The first 90 minutes was very well done, and very well paced. But after that, it just becomes meddled in confusion, with the two plot lines of him growing up, and his rule showing up every 5 minutes. Like at least Godfather Part II had many moments pacing, this was strictly back-and-forth type meddling. And none of the characters are all too memorable, other than his gay lover, so you never know who's talking or who's being killed for defying the King.The acting isn't anything to jump up and down about either. Rosario Dawson and Jared Leto are criminally underused (although the sex scene between Farrell and Dawson was pretty hot, showing everything you could ever imagine), while Angelina Jolie shows up a little too often. Colin Farrell tries his very best with his awful hairpiece, but falls short due to some of the silly dialog that Stone comes up with for his characters to use. Historically accurate or not, the characters don't have to come off as retarded.The obvious standouts are Val Kilmer and Anthony Hopkins in a basic cameo role. They both do well for what they have, and show off the acting chops that nobody else can.The prevalent homosexual elements did not bother me all that much, but yes, they are prevalent. I had heard Farrell and Leto kiss, but did not see anything of the sort other than horrendous flirting. I did however see Farrell hop into bed naked (yes, everything is shown to the camera), and then gets another male lover to hop in. While not disturbing, it did come off to me as the key gayest moment in the film.The action scenes are all very well done, showcasing the gore and violence that Troy missed out on. With the exception of the final moment's of the scene with Alexander's army fighting the India army with their elephant, they're all well coordinated and well filmed. Yeah, there is some pretty fast cutting, but not to the point of Batman Begins. As for the fight scene in India, it starts off well, but when it comes to the conclusion, everything goes red and its totally hard to see or understand just what was going on. Yeah, this may be a great effect, but neon red Stone? To the point where it's so bright you can't see a bloody thing? Another misplaced item is the score by Vangelis. It's totally not epic, and some of the battle scene music seems a little too upbeat for people murdering each other on a battlefield. There were a small amount that did fit the music, but the majority was totally inappropriate, bringing up the 'wtf was Stone thinking?' question.Now here is what I don't understand.The real person, Alexander, was a bi-sexual. History tells us that. And history also tells us that Oliver Stone is a hack, exploitive film director. So does it come to anyone's surprise that he upped the gay level? Because it sure does not surprise me.And why the hell did he need to chop out about 18 minutes of this bloated epic, and add 9 more back in for this Director's Cut? Because that doesn't make sense either. From what I heard, the music is in different places, and some of the scenes have been moved around too. So maybe I will have to watch the Theatrical Version to fully see Oliver Stone's original vision.It's not a bad movie at all, it just could have been done much better and much smoother than it was. And of course, I still face the obligatory knowledge that Oliver Stone still has yet to impress me as a director.7/10.",7,1,2,12 December 2005
Hot Fuzz," American filmmakers take note - This is a hysterical parody done right
","When I first heard about Shaun of the Dead in 2004, I was a bit skeptical. It sounded intriguing, but so many parodies had come and gone and very little of them were actually good. So when I randomly went and saw the flick, I was more than just impressed. I was ecstatic. It was a breath of fresh air, and a very funny movie. And when I picked up the DVD, it only got better.So when I first heard they were going to do a parody of the buddy cop/action genre, I got a little excited. And after seeing it, I can say that the excitement was well warranted.Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a by-the-books veteran police officer in London. He lives for stopping crime, and works non-stop. But the devoted officer is not so well liked by his peers, who, for lack of better terminology, are looking particularly terrible in comparison to him. So the higher-ups (which include a very amusing Bill Nighy) decide that something must be done, and send him to a small village with a non-existent crime rate. Here, his skills are seemingly wasted, and his action-movie obsessed partner, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) is a bit too eager to hear about his high speed, shoot-'em up days in London. But when a bizarre string of accidents begin to occur, Angel becomes a little suspicious of the quaint village, and begins to attempt an investigation.Yes, it sounds a bit more complicated than Shaun, but is it as much fun? Just about.Pegg and his co-writer/director Edgar Wright have composed what is probably the funniest and most honest parody of American action films  and it was not even made in America. Everything from the awkward partnership, the homoerotic tension, the friendly supporting characters who do not appear to be all that they seem, a ridiculous villain, overbearing Neanderthal-esquire henchmen, and more, are all on display and are each given at least one moment to shine during the film. Think of every cliché and every element that makes action movies action movies, and you will have a pretty accurate description of what you will find in Hot Fuzz.The writing is sharp and quick-witted. Just as fast paced as the editing, you may find it hard to catch everything these characters are throwing at each other. You will either be laughing far too hard from the line before, or it will just come and go so fast that you will sit and think 'What did he say?' Every line comes off excellently, and the nods and homages to other films' dialogue is just so subtle that it may go completely unnoticed. They just work it in that well. Much like Shaun, the pair use the elements given from the films they are parodying, but they use these elements lovingly, and sparingly. They make the material their own, and use it in a very fresh way (unlike the classless American parody films like Date Movie and Hostel where they basically rip scenes directly out of other films, without making any changes, and call them parodies).As said previously, the editing is very fast paced. Scenes just come and go briskly. Wright has a very observant eye, and ensures that just about every detail is packed into his scenes. Unfortunately, the fast paced editing does not stay consistent. There is a very large dry spell in the middle of the film that just slows the film right down, and to a point, over analyzes a bit too much. Even more unfortunate is the fact that most of these scenes only have a few snickers or giggles that come out (from people who either think the line is really funny, or understand which film is being parodied), and nothing much else. I felt the same way when I first saw Shaun back in 2004 (although the former film also felt more consistent during these types of scenes), but felt it improved on further viewings. I can only hope that I will feel the same way when I see this film again.Pegg is absolutely hysterical. Although he is nowhere near as much of a buffoon as he was with his Shaun character, he still has the same lovable tendencies, and the same crazy attitude. He brings a certain enigmatic flair to his scenes, and his on screen presence is simply unmatched by just about anyone. Yes, his humour is dry, but it is a lot less British and much more on the brink between British and American. He plays his character along this brink for the entirety of the movie, and even when he is at his most serious, you cannot do anything but laugh.Much the same can be said for Frost, who gives another rousing performance as the even more lovable sidekick. His lines are even funnier than Pegg's, and his goofy work here helps offset the dead-pan seriousness of Pegg. While Pegg was just as good as he was in Shaun, I think Frost was a lot more downplayed and not as strong as he could have been. Despite that, his work here is still very good, and still very ahead of anyone in American parodies.The all-star supporting cast including Nighy, Martin Freeman, Timothy Dalton, Jim Broadbent, and Paddy Considine, are all very well acted, and are side-splittingly funny. Many of them do not get nearly as much screen time as they deserve, but their material is felt throughout.While it is not as good as Shaun, Hot Fuzz is still a very funny movie. I was a little surprised with how very violent the film is, but it only adds to how accurately portrayed the action genre is in the film. If you want to see parody done right, or if you just want a great time at the movies, than this is a definite must-see.8/10.",8,6,12,24 April 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Much more than just a 'gay' love story
","Well, the front runner for Oscar gold finally came our way, and I took full advantage of it. And well, I can't say I wasn't surprised, because I was much more than that.Yes, it's about gay cowboys. Yes, it contains male nudity (there is some female nudity to boot however). Yes, they do make out. Yes, there is male on-screen sex. Yes, I mean what I'm saying. And yes, I did accidentally cough when they first start making out.But it's much more than a love story about gay cowboys. It's a heartbreaking story about a friendship that is much more than just that, yet can't go any further because of social standards. They know they can't be together, and so does the audience. The most depressing scenes in the movie (its filled with them), just tear at your heart and really make you feel like this movie should be accepted as much more than a typical love story. Or as a gay love story for that matter.The scenery is beautiful, and some of the dialog is just fantastic. Ang Lee's direction is astonishing, and the way the actors come to the material is just marvelous to watch. Heath (even with his annoying accent) and Jake give Oscar worthy performances, while Michelle and Anne may be up there in the limelight a whole lot more if there was just more of them in the actual film. Because its all about Heath and Jake, the whole female presence gets cut right off (in the 135 minute-odd movie, anything that isn't male doesn't show up until at least 40 minutes in). While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, you just really notice how little scenery either get to really chew. Michelle gets more than Anne, but their performances still come out to being about equal.But another thing you notice is while the years in the film are moving by at break-neck speeds, the movie has a serious issue with slowness. The whole movie is just fantastic, but its bogged down with long tracking shots, and long bits of unneeded scenery or dialog. It could have easily had at least 15 minutes excised, and it would be the same if not even better. And like I said earlier, the movie is horribly depressing. I did not expect nearly as much heartbreak and tragedy as I got, but then again, I doubt anyone else did either, and that's why it is cleaning house at all the award shows.Overall, I wouldn't be upset about it winning Best Picture, but then find myself knowing there were at least 2 movies better than it this past year.9/10.",9,7,11,22 January 2006
Orphan," You'll wish the ending was not so laughably absurd
","After the loss of their third child, Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard) still want to have a child and decide to adopt. They want a girl, and after a visit to a local girls' orphanage, decide on the nine-year-old Russian Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman). She seems to know a lot for a kid her age, and acts more incredibly polite and proper than anyone could ever expect. But as strange and bizarre things begin to occur, Kate begins to think Esther is not exactly who they thought she was.For a movie as standard sounding and looking as Orphan, I was expecting a predictable movie with a few scares. I was told the ending well before seeing it, but even with expecting the twist, I still was fairly impressed by just how well done the film was. The film manages to work in solemn reverence of films about evil children that have come before, but adds its own stroke of frights and excitement. It aims to be bizarre and horrify, and it mostly manages to pull this small task off. The storyline stays consistent until the ending, adding layers of baffling questions on top of each other. We really feel for Kate as her whole moral fabric begins to fall apart trying to figure out Esther's past, and we really learn to hate Esther for all the games she keeps playing with the family.But then the ending comes, and it feels like a bullet train collided with your brain head on. I was prepared for the most unlikely twist I have ever heard, but knowing does not nearly prepare you for how laughably ludicrous it is. It just comes as so unlikely, so unpredictable and is played out so silly that you realize why it is so unique and why no one even bothered to think of it before. The only reason it works the way it is, is because of how original an idea it is, and how totally unexpected it comes after watching the rest of the film. I can only imagine how baffled people who knew nothing about the ending felt after the twist was revealed. It is not as earth shattering an event as finding out who Keyser Soze was in The Usual Suspects or the real relationship between the Narrator and Tyler Durdan in Fight Club, but it does make you briefly want to reconsider everything that happens in the film up to that point.In a way, the out-of-left-field ending actually ruins the film. Up to that point, it is a tense thriller that manages to disturb in ways few films can (with its surprisingly obscene violence and fairly enigmatic villain). But after that point, it just descends into being ridiculous and borders on self parody. I realize the effect the filmmakers were going for, but it just transcends into not being anywhere near as worthwhile an idea as it should. The audience should be mortified by the truth, not paralyzed into laughter. Even with the events that come after the big reveal, all you can do is laugh at what the movie quickly becomes. While I cannot really think of any better way to end the film, it just seems so off-putting letting the filmmakers get away with something so preposterous. It is the worst kind of cheat; one that does away with anything the film had going for it. And for a low key horror film like this, it makes for a truly disappointing final product.The film is not all triumph before the ending. While I enjoyed the slow build of revealing the secrets of how troubled the family was prior to Esther's adoption, the entire plot line of Kate trying to figure out Esther's past is a bit hit or miss. Watching everyone doubt Kate over and over again got a bit tedious, and got rather annoying after awhile. Watching the kids act out of fear for their lives was great, but watching the adults otherwise completely ignore their outright cries for help (sometimes literal cries) was nearly as silly as the ending. The film manages to wrap itself so well that these little tidbits just work against it deeply.Farmiga and Sarsgaard work fairly well together, delivering believable performances as a couple in crisis. On his own, Sarsgaard spends a lot of time basically going through the motions, giving the expected responses without an immense amount of emotion for the most part. This is a little disheartening to note, as Farmiga is a force to be reckoned with throughout the film. She has not been on the Hollywood scene for long, and has already acted in a similar evil child film (Joshua with Sam Rockwell), but she really proves her chops here. She rises above the material, looking every bit as worn and tired as her character is. It takes awhile to learn just what is wrong with her, but it is worth every moment you wait simply to see how she reacts to what happens.The children fare even better. Jimmy Bennett does a great job swapping tones and body language, and Aryana Engineer is simply magnificent as the deaf-mute daughter. Really impressive work here on the filmmakers' part by adding in a significant emphasis on the use of sign language by the characters (and totally muted scenes). But Fuhrman is the reason to watch the film. This twelve-year-old delivers the scariest child performance in a long time, and is reason enough to watch the film. She just has an aura all her own that makes every moment she pops up more memorable than the next. If she does not get more work because of this film, then there is simply no justice left in the system. The film may become a train wreck, but watching it get there with Fuhrman in control is the only way it stays watchable.7/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",7,3,7,26 October 2009
Terminator Salvation," Not terrible, but imperfectly balanced by lots of good and bad
","Unlike the previous three films, Terminator Salvation takes place in the future well after Judgment Day has ravaged the earth. John Connor (Christian Bale) is only a member of the resistance against the machines yet, but is on the lookout for his future father, Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin).While it is not as good as The Terminator and can barely even be mentioned in the same sentence as the legendary Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator Salvation is really not a bad movie. But it is not a great movie either.The film does what it can to salvage the pieces of Jonathan Mostow's Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, and for the most part, it does so valiantly. Wiping the camp and the ridiculousness of its predecessor away, Terminator Salvation settles post opening credits right into the gritty and dystopic nature of the first two films, only amped up considerably. The purely visual McG and his crew make it crystal clear that the future is bleak and depressing. Barren wastelands of deserts, dank sewer living spaces, and huge industrial spaces let the audience know they are not in for anything on the lines of escapism. While many of the set designs and features sample from more notable films (such as Mad Max and Blade Runner), there is enough desolation and despair sprinkled throughout that it manages to not feel like it is as clearly ripping off others as it is. Adding little homages to the original films was also a very nice touch.The special effects and makeup are done one better. The action borders on the lunacy of Michael Bay, but manages to stay in check and at a driven pace. Watching the hundreds of explosions, and the fights between humans and terminators is something that was never really done at this level before, but the film handles it excellently. The makeup is even more astounding, and has never looked more realistic. Never once was there a question of how fake anything looked (unlike the recent X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and each effect seems to one-up the next. Some of the set pieces are eye-poppingly well done, and while nothing will ever stun the way the T-1000 still does today, some of the effects here come pretty close.But these successes, in making a bombastic summer blockbuster, can only go so far.The story, quite simply, is a mess. Leaving aside the continuity errors (as they have always plagued the series incessantly), the film just never gets out of the mindset of wanting to be the beginning of a franchise. Never once does it want to be its own unique work. It manages to not rely so much on the previous three films rather miraculously, but this does not work in its favour. Characters are introduced at incredible speed, but none of them (outside of Connor, whose motivations practically write themselves at this point) are given any backstory or motivation for their actions. We know they hate the machines, and we know they have all continue to persevere through horror and tragedy since Judgment Day. But that is it. We are merely given strict, one-dimensional character outlines for this crew of fighters (and at least one notable villain), but it feels like stuff was either chopped out during editing or just was not even bothered to be added in.I realize that starting a franchise off is not an easy task. But if you are going to make it obvious that you plan to milk at least another two films out of this, you need to at least make an effort for people to latch onto characters that stick. If there is zero development here, then what hope is there for development in the future? It all feels so arbitrary and silly after awhile (and not helped by the cheat of an ending), that you begin to wonder why they even bothered making the film in the first place.With as little as they are given, it is a little unfair to pick on the supporting cast. Bryce Dallas Howard and Common are given little else than the ability to move the plot from moment to moment. Michael Ironside, Moon Bloodgood and especially Helena Bonham Carter are interesting characters, but are never given anything really meaningful to do. Yelchin seems uneasy as Reese, and frequently appears way too immature in the integral role.Bale on the other hand, is a bit underhanded. We can see that he is putting in the same intensity here that he has in every role he has ever done, but it just does not pay off the same way it did for Batman and Pat Bateman. He just never gets out of the mindset of wanting the character to be something he is not. This character was never written or intended to be at the level Bale's performance demands of it. It is always undercut, and it always feels lacking. This character may eventually fulfill a prophecy, but Bale's hokey monologues and forceful delivery of some lines is too good for what this character should have been.That leaves me with Sam Worthington. I have tried to stay as far away from talking about him as I can, because he is the lifeblood of this film. The little known Worthington is an absolute marvel from start to finish. Marcus Wright is the most interesting new character, and is the best thing about the film. Worthington breathes a vivid life into every scene he is in, and is clearly where the most effort went when the script was written. He is just impossible to take your eyes off of. It is truly a shame that his key trait was spoiled by the marketing team.While there is a lot to like about Terminator Salvation, there is a lot to not like as well. It is imperfectly balanced, but at least it was not terrible.7/10.",7,4,8,22 May 2009
Juno," A heartwarming and bittersweet little comedy
","Following all of the hype, it was impossible for me to not want to see Juno. Everyone has raved about it for months, and I waited patiently for it to be released somewhere nearby. And the wait definitely made it worthwhile.Juno chronicles the story of the titular sixteen-year-old girl (played by Ellen Page), and the fallout of her accidental pregnancy. After deciding to not have an abortion, Juno decides that she will give the baby up for adoption to would-be parents Vanessa and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) after finding an ad in the local classified section of the newspaper.It may not sound like a deep film, but right from moment one, the film draws you into Juno's bizarre world of teenage angst and wonderment. It progresses through the stages of her pregnancy (and the seasons that pass), and through the various problems and issues that arise as a result of the pregnancy.This is aided almost exclusively by the commanding presence of Page. Her work here is simply astounding, and watching her mature as the film goes on is the stuff of movie magic. She plays Juno with a chip on her shoulder, and a keen sense of tongue in cheek. She is very in tune with the role, and even though it is not wholly original, she makes it her own and gives it a grand sense of earnestness (and pathos when needed). She plays it even better during the more hormonal aspects of the pregnancy, and she makes her undeniable mark on the movie-going public as she does. After seeing her intense, calculating and downright terrifying work in Hard Candy, I knew that she would be a presence to be reckoned with. And in seeing Juno, I now know that she truly will continue to grow into a great actress.Supporting turns from just about everyone only further complement Page's terrific acting. Garner and Bateman, while not as well written as Page, do great as the would-be adoptive parents. While Bateman taps into his not so over-the-top side (which he used to his great advantage in scene-stealing roles in Smokin' Aces and The Ex), and gives a great character performance, Garner does even better as the over-domineering wife. She gives the role a slightly creepy tinge in a few cases, but for the most part, delivers one of her best performances. While not as commanding as he was in Superbad, Michael Cera, as the father of Juno's baby, gives his character a glossy sense of naivety as the film begins, but slowly falls into a grander sense of geeky goodness as the film goes on. His shy teenage chemistry with Page is astounding, and helps give the film its greatest moments of heartfelt drama. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney round out the cast, lending the film some of its deeply funny and dramatic moments as Juno's parents, and relative newcomer Olivia Thirlby does very well as Juno's best friend.But for how great the cast was, what I was really anticipating was the screenplay, by current sensation Diablo Cody. I was a little apprehensive at wanting to jump on the bandwagon of praising her, but the script is truly wonderful. While the start of the film feels a little forced with its witty and sarcastic banter, the film gradually progresses into a very fair balance of hilarity and drama. Its gradual depth does not go unnoticed, and as the film packs into its most dramatic scenes, it really becomes apparent that Cody has a great sense of how to write really well. First time screenwriters (or even screen writing hopefuls) can take notes in how well expressed the wording is here (and how obscure pop culture references can still be funny), and just how greatly written the film is. When dialogue comes so natural to some of these characters, it becomes very obvious that the writer knows what they are doing. If she keeps up like this, than I think she could truly be the prodigy that everyone is making her out to be (although Jennifer's Body really does not sound like a step in the right direction).I think what only slows the film down is the near forced relationship between Page and Bateman that grows as the film goes on. I understand its importance to the film and understand why it is here, but I just think they play it a little too loosely and way too longish to make it feel as worthwhile as it needs to be. The two work off of each other well, yes (although not nearly as well as Page and Cera, or even Bateman and Garner), but the dialogue and scenes between them just sound like an afterthought, and do not seem in sync with the rest of the film. They have the humour, they have the references (maybe a few too many), but they just do not jive nearly as solidly as they should. Maybe a little less focus on these scenes, and more with the likes of Cera (who is not underused, but probably could have been used a bit more) or Simmons or Thrilby (who are not used nearly enough) could have helped make the movie even better than it already is.Juno is not perfect, but it is heartwarming and bittersweet all the same. I laughed and almost got choked up by how exquisitely written and how superbly acted the film was. Page is marvellous in the lead role, and Cody just might be on the right path to be true greatness. If only all small Indies could be nearly as memorable or nearly as astonishing as this one is. An obvious candidate for being one of the best (and funniest) films of the year.9/10.",9,174,328,4 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," More enjoyable than I imagined, but still not as fun as the first film
","As much as I was hyped up for it last summer, I am still in disbelief over how disappointed I was when I saw Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I had bought advanced tickets, was in a packed and cheering theatre, and still managed to fall asleep from boredom. It was so disheartening, but I still enjoyed it for the most part. Unfortunately, on repeat viewings, I cannot say I have been so generous, but nonetheless, looked forward to the next film, At World's End anyway. And while it does the job a lot better than Chest, I cannot help but think that they really dropped the ball hard after the first film.End picks up a short while after Chest with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and the rest of the usual crew in Singapore. They meet with the revered pirate lord Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat), in an attempt to acquire the maps to Davy Jones' locker, where they hope to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is planning the extinction of all pirates, and is using Davy Jones himself (Bill Nighy) to help with the job.Of course, anyone who has seen the trailer or know anything about the movie can predict what comes from here, and sadly, this is where the film loses a lot of steam. Running just short of three hours, the film packs a lot in, and pads a lot of itself out. Whereas Chest was just a whole lot of build up to nothing, End does build to something, but that something just does not feel as well planned out as it wants to be. Through all of the action, double, triple and quadruple crossings, and all of the laughs, the film just feels very drawn out for no reason but to stretch itself out longer. With the number one complaint of the series thus far being the length of the films, you would have thought a real editor would have come along and chopped out the useless stuff and left just the meaty bits. But unfortunately, this is not the case, and yet again, the viewer has to sift through a vast amount of material where a lot of nonsensical drivel (like numerous useless scenes featuring copies of Jack Sparrow) overtakes actually useful elements.Where the film does do much better than Chest, is in its focus. While the latter was jumping all over the place, this film actually stays on course for the most part. It is a lot easier to follow, and despite some of the already listed issues, feels like a stronger film. But this comes at the price of basically throwing out almost everything that Chest brought to the franchise. All of those numerous subplots? Only a few are answered, and are answered in such simplistic fashion that they should not have even been questions in the first place. All the ones that are not? They are basically left to rot, and in a way, make Chest feel like a totally useless experience minus the final five minutes. It feels like a total cheat, and while it does not effect this film (in fact, it really enriches what is here), it totally kills anything the previous film had left going for it.And with the subplots getting underused, so too are the new characters. The mysterious Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) does next to nothing, and when the big reveal as to the purpose of her character comes, she ends up feeling like a waste of time (if you can even understand what she is saying). Much the same goes for 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), Hollander's Cutler Beckett, and Yun-Fat's Sao Feng. They clearly had something to offer the last film (and Yun-Fat in this film), but here, do a few things, and then not much else. Even the astonishing performance from Nighy as Davy Jones is neglected here, taking away much of what made him such a great character in Chest. Even older characters like Jack Davenport's Norrington and Jonathan Pryce's Governor Swann are pointless, as they get next to no screen time at all.Thankfully, Depp is even better than he was in Chest. He feels a bit overshadowed again, but his role is still as amusing and often bizarre as ever. At least here he actually seems like he is trying to do something new, instead of just aping his original performance. Bloom and Knightley are strong, and much more independent this go around, adding a great deal of needed emotion to their roles. Rush however, comes out on top of everyone. His over-the-top performance of Barbossa proves to be exactly what Chest was sorely missing. He steals every scene he is in, and breathes new life into the demented character. The rest of the crew, in all of their tiny roles, all help with some much needed humour to help liven up how dark it becomes at times (as a small cameo by a very make-up heavy Keith Richards).But for all of what it does so much better (the special effects are just as great in this film, looking rather breathtaking in some sequences), the film still does not capture the fun and greatness of the first film. Yes, there is the humour and the action, but it just feels forced. It never feels as genuine or as well captured as it was in the first film (in fact, it teeters on passing ridiculous and becoming absurd, in a bad way). While the first one may have been thought of as a throw away at first, these films just stink of being pumped out just to capitalize on a wildly random success. It may be enjoyable, but for anyone looking for anything but an explanation for how shoddy Chest was, you will be looking in the wrong place.7.5/10.",7,16,27,25 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," A grand finale that sets the bar for future comic book films to come
","Despite never really being into comics, I knew the Spider-Man mythos, and watched the animated FOX series religiously. When the first movie came out, I was underwhelmed, but thoroughly enjoyed the second. As the hype machine built up for his third outing, I had my usual skepticism, and really did not want to set myself up for disappointment. And thankfully, the film did not disappoint as much as I was lead to believe in the days leading up to it.The rumours are true. There is a hell of a lot going on in Spider-Man 3. So much so, that a quick synopsis will not do it justice. But in essence, much like the first two films, the third film is about Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) struggle to juggle his personal life, his love life with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and his life as Spider-Man. Thrown into the mix this time are two villains: Flint Marko aka Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), an ex-con looking for the money to save his ailing daughter, and Eddie Brock aka Venom (Topher Grace), a rival photographer just looking to move up the ladder.And of course, they also have Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), Peter's scheming friend Harry (James Franco) and another female love interest, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard).While it is heavy on plot and even heavier on story, it is held together fairly well. Despite clocking in at one-hundred and forty minutes, the majority of the film moves at break-neck speeds, rarely slowing down at all. There is a lot of emphasis on Peter, and his slow brooding ego-centrism, but there was a surprising amount of material for the supporting characters too. Franco's character is really well shown, and his motivations are felt throughout. His scheming tendencies are put to good use finally (and not just nudged at like in the previous film), and really helps to flesh out his character. Much the same can be said for Dunst, who is probably the most evolved of any of the characters. Church and Grace's story lines are done fairly well, although I wish they both had a bit more material to help flesh them out even further. Howard's character, while being a bit of an anomaly for comic fans, is not too bad, but she sadly is the most underwritten of anyone in the main cast.If anything can be said against the story, it is that they play up Peter's ego a bit too much. I understand that it is the central core to the film, but some of his most ego-centric scenes are played off more so for laughs than anything. I liked them, but they could have done with a lot more dramatic flair.The same goes for the dialogue. I laughed a lot, and I enjoyed his smart-ass quips, but when the real emotionally wrenching stuff comes, I still felt a bit of an urge to laugh. It is very true to the language of a comic, but it could have done with a bit of beefing up with how serious it had to be. Some of these sequences are downright heartbreaking, and having the characters just rhyme off comic book dialogue can only go so far for so long. I will say though, it did not help that I had a running commentary going on behind me, making a joke out of just about anything dramatic the characters were saying. But if it was that easy for them, then clearly something needed to be fixed.But even with saying that, the acting is not ruined. It actually is the strongest of the series. Maguire is at his absolute best, playing the conflicted web-slinger. Even the slightest touch of evil from him feels magnificent. If anyone was not convinced before that this was the best choice for Peter Parker, they will after seeing this movie. Dunst and Franco are both excellent, and bring a lot of previously unseen maturity to the franchise. They work wonderfully against Maguire. Church is great as always, and Grace is pitch-perfect. I was absolutely awestruck by just how good his performance was. Smaller roles from series regulars like Harris, J.K. Simmons, Elizabeth Banks, Dylan Baker and Ted Raimi are all done with just the right amount of finesse, and cameos from Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell are more than applause-worthy.Thankfully, the film does not skimp out on the action, or the special effects. With a mostly fast-paced runtime, the film weaves itself in and out of impressive action sequences that slowly become greater in both the stakes at hand, and the intensity of the scene. And even the smallest fight scene tops anything done in the previous two films. They are choreographed wonderfully, and are captured even better. The effects are really in high gear here, and never is a scene left looking too choppy or fake. Even the most ridiculous of sequences has great CGI. They are outstanding in every sense of the word, and are not easily going to be topped. The transformation of Sandman is a particular standout, as Church is blended beautifully into the sand in one fluid motion, leaving the audience wondering if the scene was actually real or not. It is unbelievably well done, and is one of the key highlights of the film.Spider-Man 3 was an ambitious project that could have been a complete disaster. But thankfully, despite a few blemishes, the film delivers and sets the bar for future comic book films to come. The acting is top-notch, and the effects are above and beyond superb. If this is how the summer of 2007 is going to begin, I can only hope that the rest of the films coming can live up to this one.8.5/10.",8,5,11,4 May 2007
Match Point," Renewed my desire to continue watching Woody Allen films
","I am not a huge fan of Woody Allen, but continue to give him a lot of chances to redeem himself. I understand the very small niche he contributes to, and can appreciate it for what it is, even if I never seem to end up overly liking any of the films I have watched of his. But after getting tons of great reviews and even an Oscar nomination, I knew I had to see Match Point. I am very happy to say that after viewing it, I was actually impressed.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) has moved to London and is looking for a job. Being a minor professional tennis player, he gets a job teaching at a local country club and ends up meeting Tom Hewitt (Matthew Goode). Tom happens to be a member of a rather rich business-orientated family, and happily welcomes Chris to join his family to watch the opera, and later to go to a party the family is hosting. Chris meets and almost instantaneously becomes very acquainted with Tom's sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer), while charming his parents (Brian Cox and Penelope Wilton). At the party however, he ends up meeting Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), a sexy American actress, who just happens to be engaged to Tom. He is obviously smitten for her, but attempts to resist his primal urges and stick with Chloe.It may not sound like too much, but the movie is not really that complicated. It is fairly straight forward and like every other Allen film, is very dialogue driven. The film itself feels very slow and pretentious for its first half as a result of this fact, but then picks up and does not let up afterwards. By moving and sticking to a London setting instead of his traditional New York, Allen has transcended his standard film-making process, and has carved himself out something almost totally different than his past films. It has its darkly humorous moments, but for the most part, is a slow building, and totally worthwhile thriller. 2005 was a year of maturity for many prolific Hollywood personalities, and Woody Allen is no different.The cinematography really captures London, albeit from a very tourist looking prospective. It does not feel gritty or glossy, just very much in vein with something that feels a bit amateurish. It still looks wonderful of course. The editing is quick and does not bother lingering, something that many of Hollywood's newest filmmakers need to master. The script is very well rounded, and has the sense of being created by a master auteur. The dialogue is great, and very individual for all of the characters. Unfortunately, it does get a bit unrealistic at times, and becomes slightly silly. There were a few exchanges that just felt out of place in the film, and really beg the question of why they were even there in the first place. It is not terribly original (begging the question of the real reason for his Oscar nomination), but it still works and is much more clever than most modern cinema is. The addition of the opera music is a particularly great touch. It ascends and descends majestically and artfully throughout the entire film, and is absolutely fascinating to listen to and revel within. I have never seen a real opera in my life, but I feel Match Point would be a fairly close representation of one.Meyers is great as Chris. He is a bit flakey at first, but as his naivety begins to get the better of him, his performance really begins to shine. Much like the film, his performance is a graceful build right into something worthwhile. Not to give anything away, but as the film nears its ending, you can tell that this guy is really going to make something of himself in years to come. Johansson is her regular smoldering gorgeous self, and much like Meyers, gives her performance a while to build up. It is nowhere near as strong a performance as Meyers, or even some of her previous work, but is still very much proving that she is one of the best young actresses in Hollywood today (and obviously, one of the most beautiful). Supporting work is excellent across the board, from Goode to Cox to Wilton to everyone in-between. Allen has put together a very good ensemble, and all of them work wonderfully together. Mortimer is of particular mention, as her character's transition throughout the film is outstanding.Quibbles aside, the film is a great watch, and renews my desire to watch more of Woody Allen's older films. It is a very well made film, and is a definite worthwhile watch.8/10.",8,0,2,17 August 2006
Zodiac," Meticulously detailed and authentic, but overly boring in some cases
","Despite having borrowed it from my friend more than three years ago, I cannot fathom watching more than the first twenty-five minutes of Alien³. Fortunately enough, it is the only film directed by David Fincher that I have yet to watch. The rest of his films I have seen, and really like (other than the not so great Panic Room). So I waited for Zodiac with great anticipation. I held high hopes despite it being delayed, but after watching it, I think it should have been delayed a little longer.Starting with a hideous murder on July 4, 1969, the film chronicles the mass hysteria caused by a killer who only referred to himself as the Zodiac. He sends a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle listing off details only he would know about the murder. Crime reported Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) begins to follow the case intently, while cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) slowly becomes more obsessed with finding out the truth. At the same time, Inspector Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Inspector William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are following the case turn by turn.Fincher's long-awaited return is meticulous in its depiction of 1970's San Francisco. Every setting looks like it was recreated exactly to fit the time period. The newsroom looks like a near recreation of the one in All the President's Men, with all the smoking, lit up telephone lines and typewriters to boot. The attention to even the most minute details is just jarring, but only adds to how authentic the film feels. The film is also fairly homage filled, with one sequence involving a taxi cab looking exactly like the overhead tracking shots in Taxi Driver. The amount of material that Fincher covers in the film is just astonishing. The first hour or so covers almost a year of recreated details, and as the film goes on, it just trucks along with how much time goes by in the case. It was also very interesting to see how some days were covered in the film, frequently having moments spent dwindling on some days, and just blasting through others. It helped to have the little subtitles telling us the time of day and what day it actually was too.But it is the great attention to detail that also hurts the film. It feels like Fincher did not that with adding so many details, just makes the film's runtime extend out for quite awhile. I did not figure that the 158-minute runtime would be all that bad, but it just feels really stretched out after a while. I really liked all of the little details and quirks he added for all of the characters (including Toschi's adoration for animal crackers) and situations, but a lot of them just unneeded after awhile. It becomes downright boring in some places, and really begs the question of just how much material Fincher originally had covered in the film. It reminded me a lot of Robert De Niro's recent directorial effort The Good Shepherd in many places, with how much detail and material it covered. But at least here a lot of the material is interesting rather than in the former, but the film really struck me as being more like a documentary than like a regular film.All of the acting is thankfully wonderful. Downey Jr. is pitch perfect as the consistently drunk/high journalist. He brings a lot to the table, and even though he is not in the entire film, his presence is felt throughout. He is spot-on in his acting, and he also brings a much needed humour to the film. Ruffalo is also very good in his role. The slow obsession the character goes through and eventual realizations are all very well depicted, and only continue to show off his true acting chops. I have liked this guy from the start, and he only continues to impress me as he continues acting. Just watching his nervous demeanour during a screening of Dirty Harry is just marvelous in how well he conveys the character's feelings on screen.Gyllenhaal however, I was a bit on the fence with. I really like him as an actor, but here, his character just does not seem 'right'. His emotions are great, and so is his acting as per usual, but it just does not seem to be enough for his character. For some reason as the film shifts from focusing on Downey Jr. and Ruffalo to him, it just feels awkward, and is one of the reasons the film feels dragged out. He just does not seem to be able to hold all of the fabric together in a lot of scenes (despite the film being inspired by his real life counterparts books), and as the film spins out of control in how long it goes on for, so too does Gyllenhaal's character. He does great for the most part yes, but he just does hold up well against the other two main actors.The supporting cast, despite their small amount of time on screen, are all pretty good in their roles. I have not seen Edwards in a long time, but he really impressed me as Toschi's partner. He is clearly overshadowed by Ruffalo, but he does well for himself anyway. Phillip Baker Hall, Brian Cox and Elias Koteas also do very well for themselves. I was a little disappointed with Chloë Sevigny, but only because she is such a great actress, and is so underused here.On the whole, while it is so truthful and authentic in its depiction of the Zodiac case, it just feels overlong and becomes boring too soon. A little bit more editing and less focus on Gyllenhaal probably would have helped the film greatly. But as it stands, it is a good recreation of the events, and will probably be remembered for just how meticulously detailed it was.8/10.",8,1,6,9 March 2007
Milk," Great performances only strengthen an already powerful film
","There is something inherently wonderful in Gus Van Sant's Milk. Besides telling the mostly true story of openly gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk (Sean Penn), the film acts as a gay rights, and more importantly, human rights, piece that feels all too appropriate for the times.Leaving aside the homosexual bigotry we still face in 2009, it may be all too easy to see this as just another way of the Academy reaching out after the horrendous snubbing of Brokeback Mountain three years ago. That assumption is all too wrong.Milk stands on its own as a great film. Interweaving Milk's years running for political office alongside his own recording of a final will and testament, the film employs a fairly constant narrative structure of connecting the film's footage with stock footage from the actual events. In some cases, it may even be hard to tell the difference (save for some scenes where the stock footage looks blatantly worn down and grainy). It has been done many times before, but it works especially well for this film. It brings a much needed sense of realism to the film, and an even better sense of authenticity. You would never guess that the majority of these actors were even alive in the 1970s.Van Sant expertly uses Dustin Lance Black's original screenplay to weave the tale of Milk's final years living in San Francisco. We only learn vague notions of what his life was like before he met Scott Smith (James Franco) on his fortieth birthday. And while it may have helped flesh out Milk's backstory, the film succeeds without it. We learn enough about the man and what he did for the gay rights movement in 1970s America to appreciate and know who he was. The little tidbits we find out later on only cement the obvious feeling we get.And Penn, whose work I very rarely enjoy, breathes a fascinating amount of life into Milk. Penn puts his heart into the role, and really plays this one from down deep. You can see the hurt in his eyes, and the awe-inspiring joy. His body expressions say more than enough; with a simple twitch in his mouth, he can rather easily change the character's entire construct. He makes the acting look so easy, but I would be hardset not believing the real man acted in a similar way. While I think Frank Langella will ultimately win the Oscar, this is Penn's strongest work in over a decade (especially more so than that overrated Oscar-winning turn in Mystic River). His visual transformation into this inspirational individual is nothing short of amazing.Van Sant also succeeds in his use of love in the film. There are a few steamy homosexual scenes featuring Penn (none to the point of Brokeback), but they are all filmed so passionately and delicately that they look visually beautiful. In fact, the majority of this visually laden film is captured rather beautifully. Although it seems like there is particular emphasis on reflections and juxtaposition, there are some unique angles from crowd settings that help encourage the authenticity of the film even further.Josh Brolin delivers a startling performance as Dan White. If you have read anything about Milk, then you obviously know why he is so important to the story. But Brolin downplays the character for the majority of his time on screen (albeit, his first appearance comes halfway into the film). He practically quivers under Penn's shoes. But when he finally gets his moment to start chewing scenery, Brolin delivers in spades. He practically lets loose, showing off the excellent chops put to fine use in the underrated W. and No Country for Old Men. He too, plays a lot of his performance with his facial expression, and at times, he does not even need to say a word. We can just tell exactly what is going on. The man knows exactly what buttons to push to get a reaction.Franco, Emile Hirsch (Penn's leading man in the criminally snubbed Into the Wild) and Diego Luna all give fine performances in their roles. While I think Luna could have toned himself back a bit, I think Franco could have brought himself a little further. He too is quite important to the film, but he feels a bit too downplayed. I would have liked to see him do a bit more. Hirsch gets his moments, few and far between, and does a great job. He too could have done a bit more however, but nevertheless, his is a standout performance.If there are any problems, it is the fact that the film stretches itself a little too far as it nears the final act. It was not boring to the point of aping the sleep-inducing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but it was not exactly being very interesting either. I realize what is being shown is important and a lot of it thought-provokingly emotional, but there was about twenty minutes that could have easily been trimmed right down. It really feels like it is going the distance, but falters on the way there.It took a while, but it was well worth seeing Milk. Van Sant has helped craft a great piece of film-making that will surely not fade away anytime soon. While it is not clear how much of Black's screenplay is original and how much is real, the man clearly has talent and can only continue to go up from here.Milk may not be the best of the year, but it is surely among the ranks. Even if you are not gay, the film still provokes an immediate reaction I doubt will leave me. This is powerful stuff, and exactly what this film-making medium should be striving for more often. I can only wish more films will follow its example.8.5/10.",8,1,5,7 February 2009
The Prestige," A little confusing, but excellent performances make for an otherwise great all-around film
","I was stoked to see The Prestige from the moment it first began gaining buzz. Hugh Jackman. Christian Bale. Scarlett Johansson. Michael Caine. Christopher Nolan. It just had the marks for something great, and the trailers only continued to perpetuate this ideally amazing film. While the film does deliver in many instances, I cannot help but feel that it was anywhere near as good as I could have imagined. Whether I hyped it up far too much or not, is up to interpretation.It is the late 1800s, and magicians are the key theatrical acts in London. Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two up-and-comers who work together, and then instantly turn into rivals after a particularly devastating incident early in their careers. What follows is a tale of both men finding a means of one-upping each other at every turn, whether it be physically sabotaging the other person's act, using the sexy assistant Olivia (Johansson) to help get secret information, or gaining help from the even more secretive 'wizard' Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, in a rare film appearance).The thing about the film is that you have to pay attention at all times. It has moments where the film feels speedy, and others where it feels downright slow. But no matter what, something integral is always happening. Despite it being told in a particularly bizarre narrative structure (the present flashbacking to the past flashbacking even further into the past, and then back again), the film follows the key three-part magic act sequence (which any trailer fan should probably already know about). The film suffers here because it does not really stay consistent with the direction it wants to go in, and becomes a bit confusing and inane as a result. It may be a bit of a struggle to grasp the structure at first, but slowly becomes more easily accessible. At times it works strongly, but in others, it just feels like it wants to toy with the audience and do nothing else. We know every little detail matters, but should the material not be a little more solidified than it is? A bit of extra padding and focus here could have helped greatly.Being a period piece, you can see the great care and devotion taken to ensure that the film looks like it is occurring at the turn of the twentieth century. It may be dark, but there is just enough light to shine through and make everything all the more colourful. The costumes are all lavishly gorgeous, as are the backdrops and set pieces. It feels distinctive and authentic, but not to the point of being overkill. The score is just about perfect, and the editing really helps to act as the drive of the film. The great British accents are all highly in tune with the rest of the feeling of the film as well, even from the American actors.Jackman and Bale are excellent in their respective roles. Right from the start, you can tell these two are steering towards destruction, and as their characters slowly move into becoming downright evil, it becomes even more of a pleasure for the audience to watch. They play off each other well in their scenes together, and their presences are downright smoldering. These young actors really show off their chops, and show off the deeper range that only a few select modern actors can even pray to be able to show. While I really enjoy Jackman as an actor, I cannot help but realize this is one of his deepest roles yet. He's very striking in the role, but at times you can see that this is one of his first real attempts at doing so. Bale on the other hand, can add this right next to his already brooding library of ranged works (his most astonishing being his turn in American Psycho), and looks like he is right at home with the material. I know they probably will not get recognition during the awards season, but I can only hope this is a taste of things to come from both of them.Caine is great as the wise manager character that he has perfected over the years, and Bowie's small performance is practically intoxicating. He does not play the character up too much, but he plays it with just the right amount of intensity demanded. He is complemented by Andy Serkis, who thankfully plays a real-life character and not one made totally out of CGI. It was something different to actually see him literally acting, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it be just as good, if not better, than his CGI-work. Although they only have so much they can do, the three main female characters, Johansson, Piper Perabo, and newcomer Rebecca Hall all perform excellently, and work well off their co-stars. I would have liked to have seen a bit more material being used by these three, but they really stand up well against their much more heavily used male co-stars.Inevitably, the comparison to this year's 'other magician' film, Neil Burger's The Illusionist, must come up, and thankfully, it works at about the same level. They both have strong acting (although the female acting is far superior here), a good storyline, and beautiful sets. If anything, The Prestige feels like it wants to accomplish more than it can handle. Thankfully, it does not become too overbearing, but some of the confusion the film generates really does detract from it.Although not as good as Memento or Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan has added another strong film to his short resume, and continues to prove his worth in Hollywood. I can only hope that the audience does not get too overly distracted by the film's structure problems, and can truly appreciate this all-around great film.8/10.",8,14,28,20 October 2006
Cloverfield," A uniquely enigmatic and satisfying monster movie
","So here it is, after months of speculation and hype, Cloverfield has finally arrived in theatres. And the wait just may have been well worth the price of admission.A plot synopsis this late in the game may sound a bit like overkill, but suffice to say, a gigantic creature appears in New York City, and lays waste to it. Meanwhile, a group of friends, who happen to have a videocamera, record their point-of-view of the attack as they try to make it out of the city alive.What is surprising about Cloverfield is how it lacks any real depth or three-dimensional motivations for any of the characters (including the monster), but it draws you in anyway. It works in a way of saying very little, but packing a lot of strength into the things it does say. You feel an enigmatic sting right after the movie gets going, and it never manages to subside. It leaves a lot to the imagination, but at the same time, it works in so much that you fail to notice the many discrepancies and minimal plot details that would otherwise destroy a film.The storyline itself is heavily convoluted, and at times, melodramatic at best. I realize that the subplot of the party is integral to getting the group together (and the explanation for the camera), and I realize that some of these characters needed to be more than just a walking cliché waiting to get killed, but it really seems like a bit of work could have been done for them. The pathos for their situation is there (and their varying heartbreaks, including one powerfully done scene on a train platform), but the film never seems to take a crack at really making us feel for them. A lot of the dialogue exchanges between the characters are what drag the film down in its already blazingly fast running time, and could have easily been fixed up. They have their poetic moments, but they could all have had some work done (not to say that the adrenaline saturated performances here are not terrifically done as it is).Instead of focusing on the characters so much, the film's key strength is what is going on in the background. The satire and political allegories are just stunning in more than a handful of occasions. All at once the film draws on xenophobic ideals drilled into us by 9/11, old monster movies of yore (especially Godzilla) and the war on terror. The film even has a sequence that borders on being a recreation of 9/11, bringing the true realism and fear of the characters home to the audience. Seeing some of these scenes are downright terrifying, and mainly because we have seen scenes just like them in real life. Hell, the film even toys with the actions of the current generation. Instead of running for their lives, a group of people take pictures of the fallen head of the Statue of Liberty with their camera phones, presumably to later post on Facebook or MySpace. It prods around with these ideals, and in the process, creates a film that is undoubtedly immediate, and belongs to the kids of 2008. It may feel a little too close in touch with its excellent Korean brethren The Host, but its uniqueness lends itself to being more than a copy.And while some may write off the use of the handi-cam as a gimmick, it is what makes the film so enthralling and so strong. I had my doubts about the movie being entirely shot in this format, but as I watched it, I could not imagine it being nearly as powerful, or nearly as watchable if it were made with a standard film camera. Instead, the camera treats us into a sort of all-access pass, allowing the audience to feel as if they are a character themselves. And once the actual characters get running, the audience may feel like they are in for an endurance test as well. The edge of your seat mentality the film lends itself is more than enough to suggest that the film will get your blood pumping. It is not blazingly original, but for a suspense filled, mass-marketed, Hollywood film, it is definitely somewhat of a unique experience. Yes, the dizziness of some of the camera work is a bit jarring, and more often than not you may not be able to tell what is going on (and you will unlikely realize all the little things going on in the backgrounds of shot until it is too late), but these minor inconveniences only make for a more immediate and gratifying trip. The audience involvement tactic may not be for everyone, but is something that those who are willing to try, should. What impressed me the most however was how great the monster itself looks. It never stays in one spot for long, but the fear and terror that grips the characters as they catch glimpses of it is just enough. For such a small budgeted film, I was expecting something a little less realistic. Instead, it looks authentic and scary enough to be more than just someone's nightmare. Describing it will ruin the fun (and watching it tear up New York is the real treat), but the short glimpses do not last all that long thankfully. I was a little less enthused about the smaller parasitic looking beings that show up halfway into the film (and in one shot, you can tell it is clearly CGI), but they still look very well done anyway.Cloverfield is a flawed creation, but it is also very strong. Its enigmatic presence and genuine satire is something that monster movies tend to lack, but is quite hard hitting here. A little less melodrama could have made this terrifyingly and satisfyingly quick ride a whole lot less bumpy.8.5/10.",7,3,9,18 January 2008
Silent Hill," A great atmosphere, but not really much else of anything else
","Now, before I continue on, I am just going to put this right out there right away: I never really played the Silent Hill video games. As a result, I watched the movie purely from a film standpoint, and not as a comparison to the video game.And in that respect, I found the movie to be fairly terrible, if only rescued by a few things that could only have been made possible by the game.Sharon Da Silva (Jodelle Ferland) is having nightmares, all of which consistently mention a place called 'Silent Hill'. Her mother, Rose (Radha Mitchell), is getting increasingly frustrated, and one night decides to drive to the mythical place in an attempt to see if anything could be done to fix these nightmares. After an unfortunate run-in with a cop, Rose finds herself almost in an accident. She awakens in the town to find Sharon missing, and sets out to find her. While this is all going on, Rose's husband Christopher (Sean Bean), is out to try and find his wife and daughter, and uncover the secrets of the town on his way.Thinking about this plot from a gaming perspective (even though the original game's lead protagonist was male), it works magnificently. The story, the set-up, the events, and more all work out in perfect unison. Hell, the camera angles are set-up specifically to look like they did in the game. Thinking of the film like that, as a grander version of a video game, may lead people into actually thinking this movie is good.But it is not.What works in a game, does not in a movie. Everything just kind of feels thrown together, with little to no explanation. Things just seem to happen. We learn more of a 'history' of the town, and why it and its townspeople are in such rough shape, but because the game's characters and stories are not really fleshed out beyond the one-dimensional point, neither are the film's. Are we supposed to feel pity for these people, or are we just supposed to laugh at them? Are we horrified when the 'evil' shows up after a loud bell sounds, or do we just stare and wish that we were actually being scared? None of it really seems to want to work, and none of the actors or filmmakers seem to give a damn in trying to make it. Making the film have the same spirit and feel as the game is one thing, but not making the movie actually work in movie terms, is another.Like I said, all the characters are one-dimensional, and none of them really seem to stand out at all. Absolutely no one puts in a captivating performance, they just kind of look crossed between zombified and stupefied. How are we as an audience, supposed to make anything of the film when we get actors being stiffer than a piece of wood? The film is terribly boring as a result, and really, left a sour taste in my mouth. I was not sure what to expect, but I expected so much better than what was delivered.But I digress, the main measure of where this film actually has failed potential is in its visuals.This is a very atmospheric movie, and the look has not been skimped on at all. Glorious fog stays sparkled throughout the film, and the constantly dilapidating town looks really well done. Special mention goes to the effects used when the 'evil' shows up and everything begins to fall apart. Mitchell is usually found right in the middle of it, and nowhere does it ever seem fake. This sudden falling apart, and the hellacious looking creatures that appear from the beneath the cracks in the ground are fascinating to watch. They all look horrific, and all make for the film to really rise up beyond its pre-determined range. If only we could say that for the rest of the movie.Overall, the movie is only worth the invested time if people expect to look at the effects. If they come for acting or a storyline, they are well advised to be better off renting and/or buying something else.4/10.",4,0,1,22 September 2006
Crash," Compelling, but ultimately unrealistic
","On Oscar night, I do not think anyone was not at least slightly surprised that Brokeback Mountain lost Best Picture to Crash. Both were good films, but Crash, a crazy ensemble film, winning Best Picture? It seemed like a long shot going into the competition, but it managed to pull it off, and grabbed up Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay in the process. I managed to see Crash before Brokeback, and really enjoyed it, but even with some of it's problems, I still feel that Brokeback deserved the award.Crash chronicles the lives of various individuals over the span of two days, and how their lives and stories intertwine through violence and racism. The ensemble cast, including Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon (the only Oscar nomination amongst the cast), Thandie Newton, Sandra Bullock, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Ryan Phillippe, along with many others, bring the story to life, and are all given a very ample amount of time to prove their worth in the full scheme of the story.I was mesmerized by most of Crash as I watched it. The acting was great from almost everyone. These are actors playing real characters, and not cardboard cut-outs. Yes, a few members of the cast (like Bullock, Howard and Dillon) are nowhere near as good as others (like Cheadle, Bridges and Phillippe). And unfortunately, some of the great performances are overshadowed because of the need for some form of equal time on the screen for all of the actors. And for that reason, only one of the actors managed to pull off an Oscar nomination, which easily could have turned into numerous nominations if some of the other stronger actors had a chance to shine more. No one said being in an ensemble cast was easy and rewarding.The gritty feel of the film also added to the authenticity that the film contributes. Even though Paul Haggis is a Canadian, I will be damned if I do not contend that he paints a great picture of Los Angeles. His great screen writing talent only becomes better as a result of his excellent directing. His co-written words emanate throughout the entire production, and make for a hell of a greatly made film.But, even with us living in racist times, the question of just how racist everyone is really comes to mind. This film paints a picture of everyone in a city being totally racist. Some fight against it, but cannot help but turn out to be just as racist as the next person. But how realistic is that sentiment? I know for a fact that a lot of people are tolerant of others and their culture, so how is it fair to make it seem like everyone is racist? Had Haggis and Co. made some of the cast a lot more tolerant, the film would only become even more realistic than it is. At the point they left it at, it just really feels half-baked and incomplete. It feels weak in these instances, and it really does take away from the feeling the film has when it finishes.If Brokeback had its boring points sparked with fabulous performances, Crash has problems with its realism. It wants to be totally real in its creation, but the way it ends up being painted just is not. Crash is a great film, but it is one who is unworthy of the Best Picture prize.9/10.",9,4,9,3 June 2006
The Expendables," Stallone's nostalgic touch makes for a fairly well done action picture
","After undoubtedly helping kick-start the current fascination with bringing the 1980s back to the big screen, Sylvester Stallone has fairly successfully continued the trend with The Expendables. The film, an obvious action movie throwback, follows a group of mercenaries hired to take down a dictator in South America. But, as any action movie fan should know, there is a bit more to their plight than what the group initially expected.Seeing both The Losers and The A-Team, I was a little apprehensive about what to expect from The Expendables. On one hand, it was a similar film about a rather eclectic group of guys killing everything that stands in their way (albeit, with an added R-rating). But on the other, it was the only one that was merely inspired by other works, instead of outright based on something that had come before it. As well, there is thankfully no revenge subplot to speak of, something the former films followed each other a bit too closely on. With those ideas in mind, it is a bit hard seeing The Expendables as its own distinctive film on the outset. Each film has its own set of balls-to-the-wall action sequences, wise-ass one-liners and quips, and gigantic explosions.But what sets The Expendables apart, and what is likely its biggest selling point, is the nostalgia factor. Sure, The A-Team was about a group from a beloved TV series. But a few of its original stars merely had cameos in the film. In The Expendables, it is a wild mix of who's who of action stars. 80s stars like Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke are mixing it up with current action stars like Jason Statham and Jet Li, not to mention 'athletes' like Randy Couture and Steve Austin. And for added measure, two huge action stars from the decade show up in what may be the greatest cameo appearances ever conceived. It is just a shame that the trailers and press coverage ruined what is essentially, the best scene in the entire film (to think it could have been as well hidden as the zany cameo in last year's Zombieland). This cast alone is reason enough to check the film out for the sheer enjoyment of seeing them all mixing it up on-screen.But sadly, no one outside of Stallone and Statham really gets a chance to really make something of their characters, outside of the one-dimensional archetypes that set their characters up. Li gets at least two great fighting scenes, but is otherwise to crack a few jokes and be made fun of for his Asian heritage. Roberts makes for a great villain, but gets not nearly enough time to truly feel dastardly. Lundgren gets a real dramatic sequence that could have truly made something of his character, but the performance is almost entirely relegated to happening off-screen. Rourke merely has an extended cameo, and looks like he shot all of his scenes in less than a week after wandering off the set of Iron Man 2, makeup and all. You have to expect that not everyone will get a chance to really do a lot with such a big cast list, but it felt like a bit of a copout having so many recognizable people cast in the film, only to do much too little with any of them.If there is any benefit in having such a huge cast, it is in Stallone's performance. His character is for all intents and purposes, an offshoot of John Rambo. The film plays much closer to his last outing as that legendary character than it does the other mercenary-based films from this year. But instead of being the timid introvert confusing audiences with his 'depth', he is actually quite great in the leader role here. He plays off everyone well, and the added interactions allow for him to pull off a much more enjoyable performance as a result. Statham on the other hand, is the clear standout of the film, alternating between the comic relief and the genuine bad-ass of the whole film. He steers his role well (even with the needless subplot involving an ex-girlfriend played by Charisma Carpenter), and holds his own against everyone, including Stallone. He has a lot of fun in his role, and he is obviously the best thing about the film.What I really disliked was the rather horrendous looking special effects used for anything outside of stunts and fighting sequences (all of which are rather vicious, but fairly epic to watch given the fighters). The majority of explosions look horribly CG'ed, and any scene with an extended shot of fire looks like it was painted in as an afterthought. With much of the final battle taking place in and around fires and explosions, you can immediately tell how irritating this quickly became. Much the same goes for the blood, which looks like was all added in after the fact. There is nowhere near the same amount of bloodshed as in Rambo, and even less gritty realism. It just looks all too sloppy on Stallone's part, and seems rather careless. This could easily be chocked up to Stallone making the film seem closer to its 80s brethren than it should, but is still a pretty weak excuse for something that easily could have looked a lot better.The Expendables is an exciting and explosion filled action romp, but it makes clumsy mistakes that easily could have been fixed during production or even afterwards. This is a hard hitting film that hits so many marks, but falls short of a few too. It is Stallone's best work in the past few years, but it also proves that he is much stronger when acting as part of a heavily emphasized ensemble, as opposed to primarily on his own. Here's hoping we are done with mercenaries for a while.7/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",7,11,30,12 August 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," A haunting and fantastic experience that needs to be seen to be believed
","There was only one film in the last year that I have regretted not seeing in the theatre when I had a chance: Pan's Labyrinth. Everywhere I looked, there were rave reviews for it, and stupidly, I just never bothered to see it when I could have. After months of kicking myself, I snatched it up on DVD and watched it as soon as I could. And while it was not what I was expecting, I am still in awe days later.In a nutshell, Pan's Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944, and is about two people: the young and innocent Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and the evil tyrant Capitán Vidal (Sergi López). Ofelia's mother has just married Vidal, and is carrying his child as the film opens. Vidal is the leader of a sect of the Spanish military, who are holding up in the mountains of Spain, and are being consistently attacked by mercenary rebels fighting to end the civil unrest. But a strange insect begins to appear to Ofelia soon after she arrives in her new home, and even sooner does she realize that she may not be who she thinks she is.That small snippet does not even begin to crack the layered shell that is Pan's Labyrinth. It is just stunningly original in its fantasy, and totally unlike anything I have ever seen. The imagination and uniqueness at work here from writer/director Guillermo del Toro is more powerful than I could have ever imagined it would be.The very visual film packs in a lot of images to comprehend. The colours used to express the difference between characters like Ofelia and Vidal are brilliant and vibrant in their usage. And the indelible impressions they leave on the characters are only multiplied for the audience. One looks no further than to a bright scene in a bathroom with Ofelia looking at a book. She opens it, and the pages turn blood red. No sooner does this happen than she opens the door and looks into a gloomy room that has all of the brightness of the bathroom before it, but none of its visually appetizing features. Multiple scenes look like this, and whether it is dark, grim and moody (which is what most of the film looks like), or brilliantly well-lit, every image looks dazzling (even at its most graphically violent of times).Those colours only lead into how horrific and fantastical the film truly is. The horrors of war are never too intense, but they feel as authentic and real as the grimmest and bloodiest of war films. The emotion at play here, especially from the character of Vidal, is just too horrific to bare in some cases, and really play more into the imagination of just how much a tyrant he truly is, as opposed to the tyrant he comes off as. And the fantasy does not make the horror any less scary than it is. The scene with the creature called 'The Pale Man' is of particular relevance here, because when he is sitting still he looks kind of sheepishly fantastical and laughable, but once he begins moving, he becomes one of the most terrifying things ever put on screen.But that is what this movie is: an emotionally driven work of art that evolves and changes back and forth on a whim. The editing is that precise, and the storyline that well rounded, that such a feat is easily accomplished.What I did dislike though, is the fact that the movie spends a lot more time focusing on Vidal than it does on Ofelia. I absolutely adored every fantastical moment of Ofelia's journey, but I just enjoyed the moments with Vidal. It becomes a bit tedious and boring in some cases, and in others, becomes a bit too much. Some scenes just go on a tad bit too long, and feel unneeded. Of course, they also made me hyped for the next moment of fantastical beauty, but they offset it a bit too much. I understand the need for the grim reality of the situation these two main characters are in, but I think less focus on Vidal (and even less focus on the throwaway rebels) could have helped liven the fantasy up even more than it already was.For what the film lacks in pacing, it makes up for in its spectacular make-up. The tricks employed to transform Doug Jones into the Pale Man, and into the titular Pan are just nothing short of miraculous. He may start out as pure fantasy, but as the film goes on, becomes more and more close to reality. These creatures are as real as they come, and their authenticity is unnerving in a lot of cases. Kudos to Jones for the wonderful body language he employed to make these two feel so much more real than they could have been if they were just CGI.Every performance in the film is grand. Baquero is the picture of innocent, and brings a calm and beautiful resonance to Ofelia. Her pureness is marvellous, and is unmatched by the majority of her counterparts in the United States. López is excellent as the villain, and strikes a particular chord of emotion with every scene he is in. Should the audience hate him, or should they pity him for his stubbornness? He makes every moment he is in memorable, and I can only hope I will see more of him in the future. Every supporting character, especially Maribel Verdú, brings something unique to the table, and even at its most bland moments, helps make Pan's Labyrinth a worthwhile experience.It is far from perfection, but Pan's Labyrinth is an experience that every fan of cinema should take. Its fantasy, its horror, its genuine human (and creature) emotion is so far above most of its counterparts in the US, that missing it would simply be a terrible waste.8.5/10.",8,2,5,23 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A gothically twisted and darkly satisfying musical epic
","In Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Johnny Depp plays the title role of a barber sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, losing his wife and daughter. After fifteen years, he returns to London to seek revenge on the man who helped send him, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). But to lure him in, Todd needs to become a barber again, albeit one who slits throats now too.It may have been hard at first to imagine the film being true to the Broadway show, but Tim Burton has helped craft a Gothic and darkly satisfying version that is all his own, but still does the original musical justice. Every set piece, every costume and every minute that passes breathes an authentic stench of old 1800's London, only matched by those recreating the work of Charles Dickens (and in many cases, Burton's vision tops those too). The painstakingly detailed art direction is simply marvellous, and even with the film's graphic content, is enough to make just about anyone feel the need to see the movie.The cinematography and editing (stylistically wise) are also very well done, capturing quite a few great angles, and giving the sequences just the right amount of exposure that they need. They also help showcase the grand set pieces rather well. The cast is fairly small (speaking wise anyway), but everyone helps make the film exuberantly capture the murky and lurid feel of Burton was obviously going for, and also help to allow the film to fit neatly in with his twisted visions in his older films like Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and Batman Returns.Depp plays Todd brilliantly, leaving behind his over-the-top Jack Sparrow persona and tapping into his decades old emo-style he helped perfect in his previous work with Burton. He is quietly menacing throughout the entire film (and frequently frowning when he is not yelling at the top of his lungs), and his brooding sense of destruction only helps to make this another one to add to Depp's list of best performances. He outshines everyone, musical number or not, and never once does he allow let up in his intensity.Supporting turns by Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett, the baker who works under Todd's barbershop, and Rickman as Tirpin are both very well expressed, and help complement Depp's performance beautifully. Carter has genuine chemistry with Depp, and plays off him very well (even when his character is not giving into any of her advances). Their musical numbers together are probably the best in the entire film. Rickman, while a little underused here, does very well in the scenes he does have and has a great singing voice. His twisted malice is used very well here, and further makes him a shady icon in the film world. Sacha Baron Cohen and Timothy Spall do very nice work in their small roles as well, further proving their use as great character actors.I was really impressed however with the rest of the cast, including Jamie Campbell Bower, Laura Michelle Kelly, Jayne Wisener and Ed Sanders. Despite their relative newness to the film scene, all four of them do fantastic in their roles, and work fabulous with the more commonly known actors. Special mention must go out to Sanders' work, who goes above and beyond the needed maturity for the role, and nearly steals every scene that he is in.Anyone who felt the all too important element of Todd's throat slittings would either be trimmed down or cut out entirely will be very surprised to see quite a few moments here, in all of their bloody glory. While some of the blood may look slightly excessive, Burton has amped it up to truly express the rage Todd is feeling, as well as the sheer violence of it all. I was intrigued and disheartened by how bright red it was at first (and how it resembled the geysers spilt in the likes of Kill Bill: Volume 1), but it slowly grew on me. It just felt right to have it so vividly expressed, and it helps lend a darkly comic touch to more than a few of the throat slittings. What is even more intriguing is how the blood is actually the brightest element in the entire picture, and that says a lot about what Burton was obviously focusing on rather deeply.What brings the film down from true greatness is how it feels every minute of its near two hour running time. I loved every moment of it, but I think the film really dragged in the middle section, and even near the beginning. There is just no fair balance for the film, and even at its best moments, it still feels like it is kicking its feet and delaying its eventual ending. I realize that quite a few songs were trimmed or completely taken out of the film (whether this is good or bad, I have yet to decide), but the ones that were left in do not make the film feel any brisker. I also did not like how the film did not attempt to correct a few of the woes of the original show. Tirpin's character is still not developed enough. The emotionally bleak finale still feels a touch rushed. Fans of the original show will pick up on these details rather quickly, and while they do not make the film any worse, it just makes it so that the film cannot be any better.It may be the darkest and most graphic musical ever put to celluloid (at least, until Evil Dead: The Musical graces the big screen), but Sweeney Todd is also very authentic in its capturing, and is packed with great performances and even better musical numbers. It is not perfect, but it is a step in a much better direction than Dreamgirls made last year.9/10.",9,3,5,7 January 2008
Nacho Libre," Needs a lot more laughs than it has
","I watched Nacho Libre because it looked amusing. I had my doubts of course, as the reviews were virtually bad, director Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure of viewing, and I really do not love many of Jack Black's performances (save for High Fidelity and King Kong). It is with heavy disdain that I must say that the reviewers were right.Ignacio (Black) is a Friar at a local Mexican orphanage. He wants to be a man of faith, but his fellow Friars think of him as something of a joke (I wonder why?). He works at as a cook, and despite wanting to give the children better food, he is unable to give anything but the regular disgusting meal. But Ignacio seems to have a thing for wrestling, and after seeing an ad asking for amateur wrestlers, decides to try it out with a local thief, Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez). Throw in a bit of a love interest in new teacher/nun Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera), and you have the basic set-up of the film.It may sound funny on paper, with Black playing another clueless idiot of a character, but the results are much less than that. There are a few snickers here and there, but never is there a single thing that struck me as laugh out loud funny. Black has an intoxicating presence on screen, but usually lacks the acting chops to back it up. Jiménez is much funnier than Black, but he never comes to any full realization with his character. Reguera looks gorgeous, but does basically nothing throughout the entirety of the film (Peter Stormare's tiny cameo does even less even with a mention in the opening credits), and with the exception of a 'lion-esque' wrestling duo, no one else really stands out as much of anything in this production. They just go through the motions with the screenplay, and collect their cheque. There is no heart or soul in this picture, and it shows in the fact that no one even wants to try, they just want to swing by and pray for the best.The main problem here is Black himself. This is not, and probably never should have been thought of, as a character for him to portray on screen. He just does not have it in him to play this doofus. His character is clearly set-up to be absolutely hilarious, but he is just lifeless and boring. Hell, his Mexican accent does not even stay Mexican throughout the entirety of his dialogue. Much too often does Black's normal American voice creep in, and give the audience a dose of who this guy really is. Another issue is in the fact that we never really understand what Ignacio's fascination with wrestling is to start with, just that he likes it and wants to live the life. The movie is short as it is, what is another minute and a half of explanation describing why he likes the sport so much, and strives to want to participate in it? Is it too boring of an ideal to give to an audience who probably should know better than to watch a movie like this in the first place? Can Black even handle any more dialogue with his disappearing/reoccurring accent? The story itself is not too bad, although it becomes heavily repetitive and predictable as it goes along. The jokes come few and far between, and I can only hope this is intentional. It is bad enough that the few jokes that do appear are only worth a small snicker, but if there were actual jokes in the middle of these lulls and they just fell far too flat for anyone's tastes, than that would only continue to perpetuate this film's badness. It works in many ways better than Napoleon, but in other's, it feels like the exact same picture, only with more direction on the story and not just the main character's goofy quotes that are increasingly less funny every time you hear them.Another jarring thing, and a bit of a surprise for me, was the blatant CGI. There are a small handful of sequences within the film that use special effects, but the ones that do stand out like a sore thumb. They look blatantly fake (which is a no-no in any film with any form of special effects), and they look like they belong to the wrong movie. Seeing Ignacio get whacked by a bull is funny, but seeing Ignacio go up and fall back down in complete CGI form and not a more seamless CG-created version of Black is just disrespectful for the medium. In an age where a giant ape can look photo-realistic and epic battles are being fought by millions of fake machines, ancient beasts and human beings without looking any different than the historical representations of any war, crappy CGI just does not cut it anymore. It needs to look realistic, no matter how small the shot. And here, it just looks silly and awkward.Even with the problems, the visuals are all in check and very vibrant in their use. I love the red on blue outfit that Ignacio wears when he is Nacho, and I was really digging how realistic the villages and costumes the characters were wearing. I have never been to Mexico, but from what I know and imagine of it, this is what I am thinking. So the film gets some props for that at least.On the whole, Nacho Libre is just one of those movies that may make a funny premise and a great trailer, but just ends up being DOA when it actually starts playing. A better script and much stronger acting could have helped this film become something actually worthwhile. But instead, it is just Napoleon Dynamite-lite. And that movie was not all too great to start with.3/10.",3,0,2,28 December 2006
Shutter Island," The trip to Shutter Island is worthwhile if only for DiCaprio's amazing performance
","There are only a handful of filmmakers whose work I compulsively follow and run out instantaneously on or near their film's release date to see. But there are very few filmmakers who can make a movie, not a predetermined blockbuster, feel like an event. Yet somehow, Martin Scorsese manages to do it every time. And when Shutter Island was delayed from October 2009 until February 2010, you can imagine how disappointed I felt. But it helped build the anticipation even greater.U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent to the titular island to investigate the disappearance of a patient at Ashecliffe Hospital in 1954. The hospital houses the criminally insane in various buildings, including some of the worst offenders in the country. As the pair begins interviewing doctors, nurses, patients and the like, they quickly realize not everything is right at Shutter Island. And with a ferocious storm heading their way and Daniels suffering from recurring hallucinations, getting out intact may be even harder than discovering the truth.Let me be clear on this, Marty Scorsese never makes bad films. He makes flawed films, he makes overly long self-indulgent films, he makes good films, he makes great films, and he makes brilliant films, but never bad films. Coming off his historic Oscar win for The Departed, it was clear Shutter Island was not even going to attempt to come close to repeating how incredible that film was. But in spite of that, Shutter Island comes off as a good movie but one that has flaws Scorsese easily could have corrected.The film is a slow burn of a mystery-inspired thriller. There are a lot of macguffins, a lot of inconsistencies and plenty of clues scattered throughout the film (almost surpassing the body count of The Departed), but it has a lot of trouble translating into something truly inspiring. When the film really begins unravelling and eventually hits its eye-opening climax, it becomes just as awesome as we all know Scorsese films can be. But for the most part, the content comes off as alternating between incredibly boring or incredibly fascinating. There is no middle ground at any point in the film, and I found the experience to be maddening in a lot of instances because the film just could not deliver on how incredible its trailer was. To me, Scorsese has always had a problem with the length of his films (looking simply at his last four films, two are pushing three hours in length and none are under two hours), and Shutter Island makes it incredibly clear how big a problem this can quickly become. For a thriller to be as riveting as it needs to be, it needs to keep the audience on its toes throughout its runtime. And unfortunately, Shutter Island only manages to do this half the time.Equally aggravating is the use of green-screening and special effects in the film. In some instances, it almost looks amateur in how badly edited some scenes are. It is fairly common knowledge that few films in 2010 feature the actors on actual sets but more often on special effects soundstages, but many of them trick the audience into thinking it is all real with some really good editing techniques. It seems these same techniques were only employed half the time for Shutter Island and with how much of a master craftsman Scorsese is, he really should have known better and put more time into ensuring the film looked perfect. And with a five month delay, there is next to no excuse for why some scenes cheapen the look of the entire film.But even if Scorsese is faltering as a filmmaker, DiCaprio continues to strengthen as an actor. He carries the film entirely on his shoulders, and never once do we take his conviction for granted. Daniels is a war veteran who suffers from hallucinations, and DiCaprio breathes depth, sorrow, anger, confusion and genuine fear into every frame he occupies. He is the focus of the entire film, and he fills its running time with a complex character that nearly makes his Oscar-nominated turn as Howard Hughes feel juvenile. The man continues to grow as an actor, and with each new role he takes on, he is moving ever closer to his eventual acting Oscar. And after seeing his whirlwind of emotions on display here and his emotionally devastating role in Revolutionary Road (the real film Kate Winslet deserved an Oscar for last year), I can only hope it comes very soon.The supporting cast is all excellent in their roles. Ruffalo continues to impress as a supporting actor. He has yet to truly master leading man status, but he plays off with DiCaprio better with each scene that passes. Max von Sydow, John Carroll Lynch and especially Ben Kingsley all deliver great performances as the main members of staff Daniels and Aule encounter. The three of them are just great alternating between being cooperative and sinister all at once. Michelle Williams is an even bigger standout, despite the trailer giving away her main function in the film. I would have liked to have seen a whole lot more from Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine, Elias Koteas and Jackie Earle Haley however. As great as they all are, they all appear basically in extended cameos. A little disappointing for how haunting their parts all turn out to be.If you can look past its boring sequences, the trip to Shutter Island is worthwhile. It is a good movie, but it falls short of greatness. DiCaprio is truly amazing in his role, but I cannot help but feel disappointed in the film as a whole. It easily could have been much better, but I think the five month delay ended up being more detrimental than beneficial for it.8/10.",8,2,6,21 February 2010
Capote," Performance amazing, movie terribly boring
","I finally got to see Capote to bank in on its recent Oscar success.And well, I was disappointed tremendously.It's not that Capote is a bad movie by any stretch. The filmmakers clearly know how to make a movie, and the acting and writing is topnotch. It's just that...the movie is boring. It drags out for what seems like hours, but are only painful minutes. It harps on some plot points, but misses others or just pokes at them.It seems like they were going for a real arty feel, and just ended up forgetting to add any invigoration to it. While being topnotch in many categories, it just doesn't have the uplifting, or movement needed to make a film be enjoyable on all counts. I wanted to fall asleep for much of the movie, it just was too boring for my liking.The story itself is tremendously interesting, but the movie just lacks the life force and power to make the entire thing work. If they chopped a bit out, and added some more interesting elements to it, then it would have been a whole lot better.Of course, Hoffman is fabulous as Capote himself. The mannerisms he inhibits are excellent, and you can really almost see the real man he's portraying. Whereas Charlize just wanted glory for Monster, and Jamie Foxx faltered in more than a handful of areas in Ray, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is perfect as Capote. He chews up every scene he's in, and completely blows all the other actors in the film into the wind. Catherine Keener may have got an Oscar nod, but she completely lost out on making any sort of impression, because Hoffman stole it from everybody.The movie may be lacking, but he is not. He deserves the award hands down. It's a boring film with a astonishing Oscar worthy performance. If you have to see it, see it for Hoffman, and nothing else.7.5/10.",7,0,3,7 February 2006
The Devil Wears Prada," Better than I assumed, but Streep's excellent performance does not make up for all of its flaws
","Going into The Devil Wears Prada, I was not expecting all that much. It looked intriguing, but looked like it was a chick flick through and through. Despite Meryl Streep's obvious Oscar nomination, I still was only vaguely interested in seeing it. And despite my thoughts to the contrary, I did enjoy it a whole lot more than I assumed I would.At a price of course.The film tells the story of Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a recent journalism grad who is down on her luck, and is basically forced to apply to be a personal assistant at a fashion magazine. Despite her lack of fashion sense, evil boss Miranda Priestly (Streep) hires her on, and puts her right through the gears from the start. Even with the amounting stress from Miranda and her other assistant Emily (Emily Blunt), who hates Andy from the start, she has to continue to work there, or risk not having a shot at a job she really wants.Thinking I was going to fed standard issue fluff, I was very surprised by how hard-hitting the film tries to be. Everyone at Runway, the fashion magazine Andy works for, are downright obnoxious. I figured they would just poke fun at her, and treat her like trash, but these people are just mean and awful to her. Although it got frequently interesting, I was downright horrified by some of the phrases and words being thrown around, and was impressed by the amount of pathos the filmmakers made for Andy's character. Watching her have to run around like an idiot added a jolt of realism that I did not expect to see at all.But almost carelessly, any uniqueness about the film is thrown away in the latter half when it just becomes a cookie-cutter tale of becoming what you hate. The morality tale it slowly becomes is just nowhere near as interesting as its original 'boss from hell' storyline. Just watching the film slip into this mode was very disheartening, and almost ruined anything the film had going for it. It was as if they realized that their novel idea was only vaguely novel, and just decided to make the rest of the film dull and predictable to try and make up for it. It essentially became exactly what I half assumed it would.Another neglectful aspect of the film is the need to continually bring in Andy's friends into the mix. So much is going on with Miranda and the world of Runway that when these characters continue to enter the mix off and on, they just feel awkward and forcefully put in to help bridge gaps. All three of her friends, Lily (Tracie Thoms), Doug (Rich Sommer) and her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier of Entourage fame), just feel tacked on haphazardly, and really stand to do nothing in the film. Yes, they do have a point in it (especially Grenier's character), but none of them are developed at all, and essentially become useless in the grand scheme of things.Hathaway is barely developed herself. Yes, she does go through a very drastic transformation as the film goes on, but her character's stupidity and naivety are never quite explained. We know she wants to get ahead, but any secondary details are just completely negated from being told to us. Her second love interest, Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), only continues to add confusion for the character, and just makes for some of the most clumsy and angering moments in the entire film. Her interaction with this guy should have been replaced with more scenes with her friends and/or boyfriend. On one level, she does fairly well for herself. But on the other, she just brings the entire film to a standstill, and seems to be channeling an older version of her character in The Princess Diaries.Streep on the other hand, is pitch perfect in her deliciously delectable role. When she first came on screen, she looked a lot like Cruella De Vil. But as the film went on, I realized she was so much more evil than that. Her barely wincing and thoroughly melancholic portrayal is marvelous, and makes her one of the most convincing antagonists of recent years. Just watching her coldly directing everyone around her is the key to her devilish demeanour, and it lights up the film in a way that no one else manages to do. She does truly memorable work here, and more than deserved an Oscar nomination.Supporting turns from Blunt and Stanley Tucci are both particularly memorable, if not for working great against Streep, but for completely showing up Hathaway at any point they are on-screen with her. The two of them bite right into the scenery around them, and make their supporting roles feel so much more important than they should be. I have come to expect this great level of character work from Tucci, but having never seen Blunt in anything made me have doubts about her performance. But thankfully, she delivers in spades, and makes her presence known. She will definitely be one to look out for in the future.The costumes are also very well done as they needed to be. In some cases, they almost seem like they are characters themselves.On one hand, the film works very well in its depiction of the 'dog eat dog' world of fashion. On the other, it really feels like something we have all seen done before. It is disheartening, but Streep does a fine job in her magnificent role to try and make up for its shortcomings. Backed up by great supporting performances from Blunt and Tucci, she really is the reason the film is watchable in the first place. If for any reason, watch the film for her, and just ignore the storyline.7.5/10.",7,1,2,2 March 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Not perfect, but all around excellent otherwise
","Even to this day, I have yet to understand how the trend of Ben Affleck bashing started. Yeah, the man has starred in some pretty awful films, but then, which supremely entertaining and brilliant actor has not? Is there really something so godawful and putrid about Affleck's style that just seems to irk everyone into stereotypically bashing him? It bothers me to no end, but after being one of the few campaigning for awards recognition last year for his dazzling supporting turn in the otherwise forgettable Hollywoodland, and now after seeing his written/directed effort of Gone Baby Gone, I can only hope that these stereotypes will come to an end.Gone Baby Gone revolves around private detective Patrick Kenzie (Ben's little brother Casey Affleck). Kenzie is hired, alongside with his live in partner Angie (Michelle Monaghan), to help police find a missing little girl. Kenzie, known for his knowledge of many of Boston's degenerates, seems to be a natural fit for the job. What follows, at its core, is a tale of morality. While I have never been the biggest fan of preachy films, Affleck manages to side step any reverend-esquire moments, and focuses in on simplistic cause and effect. Thankfully, in all of his years in Hollywood, he has managed to understand the thin line between gracious ponderings and blatant throat shovings. Even at its most convoluted moments, Gone Baby Gone stays very focused, and does not attempt to dwindle into the territory better suited for veteran directors and writers. The film does not play itself off as amateur on any instant, but it does not feel well rounded enough to be considered having been created by an expert.And as much as I wanted to adore each and every frame of this film, it does have its flaws. The opening hour, as you more than likely have read, plays off immaculately, even if it feels like it could have been tightened more than it already is. For someone relatively new to the production side of things, Affleck pulls this off with finesse and grace. He knows just the right moments to play tense, and just the right moments to stay soft and brooding. It is thrilling and just all around excellent. But then, the film kind of trails itself off after it hits its emotional peak in the middle. As it builds towards its inevitable conclusion, it just plays itself a bit too loosely, and packs in a bit too much. Never once did I attempt to calculate its plausibility or question what was happening, I just think that Affleck wanted to cram far too much of Dennis Lehane's original work into the relatively short running time of the film. As said, for as convoluted as it gets, Affleck tries his best to keep it straight-laced, and for the most part, content aside, he does very well for himself.What he also does well (or at least helps to do well), is bring the grittiness of Boston to life. Filled with images of his former neighbourhoods, the film is positively loaded with a sense of authenticity. This is a movie about Boston, from somebody who knows Boston. And with every passing moment, the film just reeks of being accurately depicted. I felt like I was living in that city, and never once did I think anyone had traveled out of there. It is just so accurately represented that the visuals practically become a character of their own. Having all the normal townspeople appear in crowd shots and in passing was a nice touch on his part as well.He also does wonders with the script. Having co-written with Aaron Stockard, Affleck brings a real sense of urgency to the film. The words are hard-hitting, and have a solid impact on each scene. I wanted to try and not compare to the Oscar-winning Mystic River, but as the film went on, it just became impossible. Except while River wallowed in its own pedantic melodrama, Gone succeeds in consistently delivering the same awe-inspiring tone. It is heavily dramatic (and darkly hilarious in more than a few instances), but it knows when to stop pushing itself. It never overstays its welcome, and not once did I feel like it was trying to one-up itself like Clint Eastwood's take on a Lehane novel. I just think they could have better worked out the kinks of the second half of the film.And if Affleck does great behind camera, than his actors do equally great in front. His brother Casey is an absolute marvel leading the film. I never thought of him as a lead actor, but seeing his genuine finesse and bold attitude at work here, I think that Hollywood just may have a new young lead to add to its rank. There is never a dull moment when he is on-screen, and his character's ballsy attitude helps propel him past even the likes of his own brother's best performances. This is a career making turn, and I can only hope that we can see such unbelievable work in the future.The supporting cast is excellent as well. Ed Harris does wonders for the enigmatic detective Bressant. Tapping into the same frightening and thought-provoking demeanour as his character in A History of Violence, Harris lays on the strong acting and never once lets up. Morgan Freeman, much like Monaghan, appear very little in the film, but help really round out strong moments in the film. I just wish Affleck used them more. Amy Ryan is another particular standout as the mother of the missing child, and helps to bring a solid sense of pathos to the characters and to the film itself.Even with its problems in the second half, Gone Baby Gone is a solid and well rounded effort from everybody involved. It deserves all the attention it gets, and I can only hope that means good things for Ben Affleck.8/10.",8,3,6,27 October 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," A wildly entertaining summer adventure
","Despite going in with incredibly low expectations, I was horrendously disappointed by Thor. It was everything I hoped it would not be, and made me worry about Captain America: The First Avenger. Even with my excitement over that film, Thor's romp through the desert made me incredibly apprehensive to think Cap's adventure would be worthwhile.After a short modern day intro, we are thrust into wartime in 1940s New York. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to fight for his country -- but has been turned away five times for health ailments and his size. Shortly after another attempt, Rogers is intercepted and quickly chosen for a Super Soldier project the US is quietly developing. He is turned into Captain America, the soldier that will help turn the tides and end the war. But while he is selling war bonds, the German science division HYDRA run by Johann Schmidt, better known as the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), is gaining more power behind enemy lines. And obviously, Rogers cannot just let that slide. I will immediately say that Thor does not deserve to breathe the same air as Captain America: The First Avenger. Minutes into the film, you know immediately where Marvel was focusing its attention all along and why Thor felt so undercooked. This film is without a doubt, the best superhero film since the one-two punch of Iron Man and The Dark Knight in 2008. Anyone weary of it being a period piece should rest at ease, as this is one of the most unique entries into the genre to date. The time period only helps bring the characters to life even more vividly than they already are depicted on-screen. But the reason the origin story works so well is because it is so wildly different than everything that has come before it. Captain America is a movie that feels right at home in the 1940s and transcends itself into the time period. From Rogers' introduction on, Joe Johnston frames the film with a sense of wonder, imagination and authenticity. Much like Inglourious Basterds before it, this is a reconstructed history. But it is done so convincingly that you may second guess yourself, trying to picture whether this very real world is actually what really happened. Johnston also layers the film with an aura of fascination and bewilderment, frequently leaving the audience in the same disbelief as the characters. When Rogers is discovering his new abilities for the first time, we feel the exact same way. But instead of embracing this astonishing feeling and letting the film breathe life into a genre that is on its last legs, it fumbles and takes us away from it all too quickly. While the first half plays out beautifully, developing the world and its characters, the second half amps up the gas and zips by without a thought for explanation or near sighted investigation. It felt like the filmmakers realized they took too long developing everything, and decided to just rush through the rest without stopping to think whether the audience would notice or not. But once you notice all of the montages, and how there is zero explanation on who the 'Howling Commandoes' are, you know Marvel may have missed out on a few crucial steps along the way of story development.For the most part, Captain America: The First Avenger is a deeply focused and ridiculously invested story of the origins of an extraordinary soldier who just wants to do his part for his country. Yes, Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) is an important character in the film, but he is the only real tie to the rest of the Marvel film canon. But as the film draws to a close, the tacked on ending starts, and suddenly, Marvel's investment in Cap suddenly turns into just another agenda pushing entry for The Avengers. It is sad and disappointing, but after four films, I should have assumed they would not have suddenly changed tactics.After playing such a great Johnny Storm, I was worried that Evans would not have the chops, charisma or gravitas needed to play Captain America. Was I ever wrong. He is absolutely flawless in the role, quickly shifting from scrawny weakling to beefy hero with ease. He remains throughout as a boy from Queens, and the look of wonder and awe in his eyes never dissipates. No matter what he is doing, Evans maintains the character, and never even considers becoming anything other than a loyal boy scout. He is a true hero through and through, and watching him in action makes me wonder why it took this long for a good Captain America film to be released.While his accent is imperfect, Weaving is exquisitely evil as the Red Skull. He is downright disturbing in some instances, and deliciously over-the-top in others. I cannot imagine anyone being as brooding and insanely evil as he is here. Cooper, Sebastian Stan, Toby Jones and Tommy Lee Jones all give excellent performances in their roles. Relative newcomer Hayley Atwell also shines in her role as the hardnosed Peggy Carter. Her subtle romance and chemistry with Evans is magnificent, as are her ability to effortlessly create a strong female lead. Special mention also must go to Stanley Tucci, whose Dr. Abraham Erskine is a welcome departure from his atypical roles as of late.While it botches any attempts at perfection (and really did not need to be post converted to 3D), Captain America: The First Avenger still manages to be a wildly entertaining adventure that is even more impressive than you may imagine. Evans is amazing in the role, and the whole film is ridiculously pulpy fun. And I dare you to not feel a warm feeling of nostalgia while humming along to the deliriously catchy 'Star Spangled Man' propaganda jingle. It makes the film worthwhile all on its own.8/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",8,63,113,31 July 2011
Burn After Reading," Disappointingly pedantic and boring
","Well over a month after seeing it, I am still disappointed by Burn After Reading. The massive amount of talent involved, the fresh from winning Oscars Coen Brothers, and the premise of a classic screwball comedy, should have meant instant gold. But instead, it rather came and went with nearly a whimper.The film jumps around quite excessively, but basically gets kickstarted after Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) quits his senior analyst job within the CIA. He gets drunk, annoys his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton), and ends up writing his memoirs. One way or another, a CD with a lot of this material is found in a local gym. Thinking it could be used as leverage towards an expensive plastic surgery bid, trainer Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) (with the help of co-worker Chad (Brad Pitt)) attempt to blackmail him into paying money to get it back. When that does not work, they go to the Russians.Throw a subplot involving the gym's manager Ted (Richard Jenkins) pining for Litzske, Cox's wife's affair with another CIA agent Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a whole lot of paranoia and intrigue, and J.K. Simmons, and you basically have what the Coens figured would be an appropriate follow-up to the mesmerizing No Country for Old Men.The problems only begin to start with the story. The film runs for 95 minutes, but it feels about a half hour longer. About five minutes into the film, I was totally bored. Sure, it had plenty of laughs here and there (and many of the Coens' signature hilariously pitch black moments), but the whole thing just lacks the zest to make it run properly from beginning to end. Hell, even comparing it to The Big Lebowski, a comedy classic ten years after its initial release, is a bit of an insult. While that movie packs laughs with a ridiculously silly story that works, this movie tries to want to give a touch of laughs and a ridiculously silly story that may have worked as an concept on paper, but not on film.Moments that should be funny are plagued by boredom, and when the emphasis on paranoia begins to sink in, the film only hurts itself more. I am a big fan of the Coens, but watching this almost made me think they may have truly lost their touch. With the exception of No Country, the brothers have yet to make anything remotely better than decent since O Brother, Where Art Thou? almost ten years ago. They clearly still have some creativity left in them, but they are barely polishing any of their movies before churning them out. This film feels like it could have been able to measure up to the greatness of their classics like Lebowski and Fargo, but the magic seems to be missing. It is almost as if they are trying to recreate something they used to have, but no longer can even muster to make work. Yes, the movie is funnier than a lot of the usual film offerings, but at the expense of putting the audience through agonizing torture waiting for the next funny moment. I would like to think that No Country was not merely a fluke, but with something as rushed and pedantic as this, I cannot fathom thinking of it as anything else.The acting is almost just as disappointing.I have heard the raves, but as far as I was concerned, McDormand and Swinton were fairly bland in their roles. McDormand gets a lot more to do than Swinton, but both look and sound like they are merely taking up space, and getting ready between takes to grab their money. I usually like McDormand, but her character just seemed so plain and lazy that I could never take her seriously for an instant. This may have been the intent, but when we have to watch the pathos and desperation build for her, I think we can assume she needed to put a little more effort in. Swinton serves as a mere catalyst to the reasoning for the whole film in general, but she is so underused and underwritten it hurts (especially after coming off an Oscar win for Michael Clayton). Even worse, she puts less effort into her performance than McDormand does.Clooney, while clearly putting more effort into his character, is just too silly for this film. His zany, oversexed nature is a little jarring when it first springs up, but it gets to be a little bit of a handful by the end of the film. He is clearly just trying to ham it up as someone who may or may not be a close representation of the real-life Clooney, but the results of this bizarre attempt are hit and miss. Malkovich on the other hand, gives a valiant effort with his character. Although his character is nowhere near as important in the second half as he is in the first, he shines rather brightly within the cast as someone who takes the role seriously, but clearly has the ability to play funny too. I think if the focus reverted and stayed on Malkovich the whole time, he could have made up for more than enough faults the film has.As it stands however, Pitt is the one who steals the movie. Playing totally out of character, his silly performance is the only real reason anyone should sit through the movie (and the criminally underused Simmons). His weird portrayal fits in very well, and is nowhere near as jarring as Clooney's. Pitt is clearly having fun, and is giving it his all to convince everyone that he is playing the anti-Brad Pitt. It is just too bad that he is negated to being a mere supporting character to the rest of the cast. If they all worked with one screw loose and put in some effort like he does, the movie could have actually been worthwhile.6/10.",6,7,15,29 October 2008
Watchmen," A breathtaking motion picture event
","Director Zack Snyder has done the impossible. He has made the 'unfilmable', legendary graphic novel, Watchmen, into a film. But Watchmen is not merely a film  it is a motion picture event, unlike many that have come before it. The stakes were high, and the furor of fanboys worldwide would cause anyone a touch of anxiety over such a beloved property. But after the reverence and blood-splattered brilliance of 300, did anyone actually think Snyder would do a bad job?Featuring a plethora of a cast, Watchmen takes place in an alternate 1985, where Richard Nixon is in his fifth-term as President, America won the Vietnam War, and costumed heroes have been banned. The film picks up with Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) investigating the murder of Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). He finds out early on that Blake is actually another costumed hero, The Comedian, and gets it in his head that there may be a 'mask killer' on the loose, and Blake was just the beginning.What unfolds of course is the stuff of comic book legend. Mixing intrigue, action, suspense, romance, horror, and pitch black comedy, Watchmen is a tale that is not for the faint of heart, and may leave more than one person baffled. The reverence for the source material bleeds right through each frame of the film, from the obnoxiously bright yellow opening to the colourfully drab finale. It is clear that Snyder, writers Alex Tse and Solid Snake himself, David Hayter, and the rest of the crew had the graphic novel close by at every waking moment to ensure authenticity to the book. So much of the graphic novel's twelve chapters have been reproduced here, and with such a heavy attention to detail that it is nearly a carbon copy.Yes, there are some changes here and there, but many nuisances will only be picked up by the most avid of fans (the most obvious is the ending). They are simply well concealed, or have been modified so casually that it should not matter to anyone that it has been altered. The filmmakers even improve on a few of the flaws of the graphic novel (and still wallow in a few as well), almost complementing it as having a stroke of originality to it. Yes, some things have been outright removed as well (and should appear in the future, already announced Extended Cut DVD releases), but again, many of these removals are for the better.This is of course, due to the editing of the picture. At 163 minutes, this movie is a touch gargantuan in nature. But after sifting through the lengthy backstory moments early on in the film, the film practically flies by. For such densely loaded material, Snyder and company have managed to address practically everything, and have not sacrificed the film's pacing. There are a few slow spots, but never do they feel as drawn out as the likes of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. I was genuinely surprised by just how fast it flew by, and how new the material felt even though I knew every beat that was coming. They just make the material so interesting that it becomes too difficult to bear looking away for any instant.But the film's pacing manages to still be an issue. The filmmakers managed to make the film accessible and understandable to readers and non-readers alike, but at times it may feel a little overwhelming for anyone new to the story. It is clearly not to the point that the film is for fanboys only, but there is a certain aura about the film that stalls it from immediately registering for everyone. I even had to second guess myself on more than one occasion, and imagine I will be explaining this film for a long time coming. The film is incredible either way, but I think a few extra minutes of explanation could have helped the film go a long way.The acting is great across the board. Haley is an absolute marvel as Rorschach, exhibiting an even greater performance than his Oscar-nominated turn in Little Children. He plays him with just the right amount of psychopathic touch that the audience is still able to feel pathos when needed. His attitudes are so twisted and his personality so convoluted that it is almost like watching two different people, instead of just him. He is so in tune it is downright frightening. Much the same goes for Morgan. He does not get an immense amount of screen time, but he does an amazing job with what he is given. This character is the worst kind of scum, but Morgan still makes him likable, and brings a gritty edge totally missing from the graphic novel. It will be hard not thinking of his portrayal anytime I read the graphic novel from here on out.The rest of the supporting cast, no matter how significant, are overshadowed or downplayed because of these two overbearing performances. Despite being on screen for a significant amount of time, I just could not latch onto Patrick Wilson's Nite Owl II. He just lacks the right strength and looks, to make something of this character. Malin Akerman does a great job with Silk Spectre II, as does the heavily CGI-ed Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan. But the two of them never seem to be totally immersed in their characters like Haley or Morgan. Their stories and dialogue are there, but they lack the intensity of the original work. Matthew Goode is simply not given enough to make the impression he needs to as Ozymandias.Watchmen is not perfect, but then it never was going to be. Despite this, Snyder and company have crafted a truly reverent work unlike any other we will see for a long time. With breaktaking scenes, and amazing performances from at least two cast members, Watchmen needs to be seen to be believed.8/10.",8,2,6,6 March 2009
21," A shoddy script and terrible characterization make 21 barely watchable
","Ben (Jim Sturgess) is a math whiz-kid at MIT. He dreams of going to Harvard Med School, has the grades and the acceptance, but has nowhere near enough money to put himself through it. Enter Professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey), who takes a shining to the kid after a rather brilliant mathematics discussion during a class. As it turns out, Rosa is running a blackjack counting group who goes to Vegas on weekends and make tons of money.Obviously, we know as an audience that this can lead to no good, but are taken along for the adventure anyway. Unfortunately, the ride does not last very long.What plagues 21 incessantly is its wanton desire to be a more complicated and intricate movie than it is. Yes, it does deal with a lot of intense mathematical equations, but it never tries asking the audience to answer them. It does give us a rather lengthy montage as to how this team works (using hand gestures and certain words in phrases), and then tells us again when anyone mentions one of these words. It almost gets to the point where the filmmakers begin beating the audience over the head with these simple words (such as 'eggs' and 'sweet') that we wonder if they had any subtle notions over their subject matter. We see the varying hand gestures multiple times too, but at least they blend in a lot better than a blatant cut to that specific scene in the original montage.The story itself is a bit of a mess in that it plays out almost frame for frame like any other film with a young person looking to make money the quickest way they can (with an interesting, little-seen twist nevertheless), right down to the supportive mother and neglected friends. And after seeing movies like Martin Scorsese's lengthy epic Casino and the small Canadian film The Last Casino (based off the same material as 21, but somehow ended up being a smoother and more interesting film), you can tell exactly where this film is going to end up by its last frame. Hell, Lawrence Fishburne shows up for less than thirty minutes of screen time, and right after he starts talking, predictability more than just sets in. It gets comfy and makes you feel stupid for even attempting to give this movie a shot.And because it is so predictable, the movie becomes boring quickly. Seeing the same montages over and over again becomes tedious, and watching these characters move to their eventual ending is almost painful. But the film drags its heels for every minute of its just over two hour run time, and rather than try and attempt to make the film interesting, everything thrown in just makes it more dull and repetitive.The characters are not much of a help here either. The main character has his motivations for joining the club, but we are never given any sort of indication why any of the other group members are there. Jill (Kate Bosworth) is the supposed sexpot goddess of Ben's dreams, Fisher (Jacob Pitts) is the has been of the group who has a grudge against Ben, and Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Choi (Aaron Yoo) are there simply as glorified seat fillers. Those two do the majority of the hand signaling, and just about nothing else (Choi has a bizarre, albeit useless, subplot where he steals bottles of booze and cheap hotel room pens). Jill and Fisher serve their purposes, and then spend the rest of the movie in a daze, basically going through the motions right up to their character's final moment on screen. I realize this story was based off a book, which in turn was based off a true story, but there has got to have been more to these characters than these simplistic cut outs.Sturgess, in his first truly lead role (Across the Universe was an ensemble to its very core), is weak as Ben. We can see him struggling to hold the picture together from the start, and he does not get much better as the film goes on. I think it could have been significantly stronger without his continuous narration, but even without it, Sturgess just looks uncomfortable with what he is doing, and almost looks out of place. I can understand that Julie Taymor's uniquely flawed musical opened a lot of doors for him, but this is one he should have either missed entirely, or trained up for a little bit better.Out of the supporting cast of young people, Bosworth is the only one who really gets a chance to shine, and she does a fairly lousy job of it. As said previously, she plays the supposed sexpot goddess, and she does that. But only, that. She never makes any attempts at giving the character something interesting to do besides watch Ben, and gives even less of a reason for Ben to be so infatuated with her.Spacey and Fishburne on the other hand, appear to be enjoying themselves as they chew scenery literally limb from limb. This is clearly not their best work, but their roles allow them the space to give their characters a certain finesse and originality that this script clearly made no mention of having. If only they could have rubbed some of their talent off on these young actors, we could have truly had a watchable movie on our hands.Even with an interesting concept, 21 managed to entertain very little, and frustrate even more. Even with great performances from two seasoned character actors, there is no saving this film from its shoddy acting, and even worse storyline. A solid polish, and less feeling like those that have come before it, could have only made this film worthwhile.4/10.",4,1,1,12 August 2008
The Hills Have Eyes," Outstanding makeup, but the film just does not have the same edge as it did in 1977
","In an act that only continues to prove Hollywood's infinite wisdom, the film studios continue to greenlight remakes of older films. But the modern filmgoing audience keeps eating them up, so is there any wonder why they continue rolling them out, subpar or not? While there have been many examples of such thinking, the remake of The Hills Have Eyes is somewhat split down the middle. On one hand, it does better for itself than Wes Craven's original film could have ever hoped for itself. But on the other, it just lacks any of the spirit or the intensity of one of Craven's master films.The basic way to explain the film is just to simply state that the films revolves around two families. One is the good, wholesome Carter family lead by Big Bob (Ted Levine), on their way to California with their truck and camper in tow. The other is a family who has been mutated by radiation from American nuclear test weapons, and now live in the deserted hills in the middle of nowhere. After the Carters get some really terrible directions, they hit a snag and end up mangling their truck. As Bob and his son-in-law Doug (Aaron Stanford) set out to get help, the rest of the family stays back and sit idly waiting while the mutant family begins to devise their own plans.In comparing the original and remake side-by-side, the thing that works the best in favour of the remake is the backstory for the mutant family living in the hills. In the original, they just seemed to be a small group of deranged hillbillies who happened to live out in the hills. Here, it is a rather large group of people, who just never left their home town when they were asked to by American nuke testers. As a result, the testers dropped their bombs and thus the people began to mutate. Unfortunately, as a result of making this contribution to the sequel, Writer/Director Alexandre Aja and his partner Grégory Levasseur have sacrificed any sort of development they could do with these characters. Instead of having some form of conscious and thinking like Craven's hillbillies, Aja and Levasseur's mutants are just monsters. They are evil and sadistic on purpose, not just by chance. They lose any of the terror or intensity they built in the original film right after we find out that they are the reason for the Carters crashing.But then, purpose is also a problem for the Carter family too. They have no humanistic traits, they are just the bait to the monsters. Yes, we understand that they are like sheep being led to slaughter, but they just do not seem to feel real enough for us to care. No one stands out as a likable character, and no one is developed enough for us to dislike them either. When members of either family start to die, the audience just cannot fathom the proper way to react. Aja and Levasseur just keep feeding the story along, and just do not seem to have any idea what kind of reactions they want to get from what is happening. In Craven's film, he managed to ensure that the audience had no idea which group to sympathize with. Here, no one seems to care what anyone does.And of course, the characters are not helped by any of the performances. Levine's Big Bob, the mother Ethel (Kathleen Quinlan) and their eldest daughter Lynn (Vinessa Shaw) are completely downplayed throughout their limited screen time, as is Papa Jupiter (the always excellent Billy Drago), who Aja and Levasseur do not even bother explaining to the audience to be the leader of the mutants. While they were not exactly big characters in the original (except for Jupiter, who was actually a key part of that film but is basically worthless here), they still had the audience caring for them. Not here. Putting every single ounce of focus on Bobby (Dan Byrd), Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) and Stanford's Doug just does not cut it. This movie was longer than the original, but lacks any of the dialogue or story for the actors to use for their characters. How does that work? I must concede however that the gruesome makeup and gore shots are fabulous. The continued excellence from the wizards Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger is absolutely astounding. From simple blood shots, to the brutal wounds and bruises inflicted upon our cast of characters, all of it is just as bloody and horrific as it should be. They do not skim on any brutality like a PG-13 rated horror film does. They revel in their R-rating, and they totally deliver on that rating's promise. As a result, the much hyped sequence inside of the trailer half way through the film is for the most part, very well executed and squirm-inducing. The makeup that brings the mutants to life is award worthy on its own. The look and feel of these monsters is absolutely terrifying, and should send shivers down people's spines as they look at these grotesque creations. It's just too bad they border on parody when they are actually doing something on screen.And while you would not exactly think it from the type of film it is, the cinematography and set direction is very well done.Yet again, Aja has fumbled. While the mutants make look nightmarish, and the look of the film is fairly terrifying, the script just does not make anything good come out of it. The acting is nothing special, and the story just does not have the same edge as it did in 1977. But hey, what do I know? They are already in production of the sequel as I write this. I guess it really is just a matter of taste.5/10.(An edited version of this review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",5,0,1,11 September 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," A great family dramedy with excellent performances all around
","I saw the trailer months ago, but it never clicked in my head that Little Miss Sunshine was the big film from the Sundance Film Festival. It looked like an Indie, but not to the point that the usual batch of Sundance films do. But I waited anyway to see it anyway, and after opening wider within the past few weeks, I finally got the chance.Little Miss Sunshine is basically a road movie revolving around a completely dysfunctional family on their way to a beauty pageant in California. The family includes the father Richard (Greg Kinnear), a motivational speaker who is always pumping his 9 step program while waiting for the book deal to come in; mother Sheryl (Toni Collette), who is unsure of what to do with herself as the family faces financial ruin; Sheryl's brother Frank (Steve Carrell), a gay Proust scholar who just happens to be suicidal; Grandpa (Alan Arkin), who is obsessed with porn and snorting heroin; Dwayne (Paul Dano), the son who is taking a vow of silence; and Olive (Abigail Breslin), the daughter who is getting ready to act in the titular pageant.The characters may sound like they were tailor made for a sitcom, but they work brilliantly on screen. There is an electric presence between these six actors, and it only gets more intense as the film goes on. Their chemistry together is absolutely awestriking and is exactly what every film studio hopes and prays for from their actors. And they deliver here in masses. It is a totally dialogue driven film, and every actor pulls their weight here to make it as enjoyable as they can. While they handle the comedic elements of the script with the most perfect finesse, they handle the dramatic elements all the better. This is a family dramedy in the truest sense.While each of the actors are great, Carrell and Dano stand out as the best of the bunch. Their performances are put together and acted to the point of being so smooth, that it becomes fascinating to watch. While Carrell's career is only going to continue to soar from here on, Dano's looks to be headed in the right direction. He is definitely going to be one to watch in the coming years. However, if he was given more screen time, I think Arkin would have been the best of the bunch. He steals scenes from everyone in the cast, and proves his worth as a veteran actor. More time on the screen could have only helped his performance become so much better than it already is.While the characters are great, the plot really does not deviate too much. It stays fairly straight forward right until the end, and mostly allows for character interactions and not much else. There are a few supporting turns, but most of them are basically cameos, as each has less than five minutes of screen time a piece. While it sticks to realism (and really gets heavy and satirical when the pageant comes closer), there were more than a handful of completely ridiculous and absurd sequences, and a few that felt like they belonged in another film entirely. It does not take away from the film for the most part, but felt a little strange in context with the rest.If you like dialogue driven comedy, then this is a definite must-see. It is hilarious and dramatic all at once, and the main six actors are just fabulous in their roles. Do not be surprised by a Best Original Screenplay nod and possibly more come Oscar time.9/10.",9,5,11,27 August 2006
Hugo," Simply stunning to watch, but a bit of a chore to love
","Martin Scorsese directing a kid's movie? You cannot be serious.That was the thought that ran through my head when I first read about Hugo, based on the children's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. While it seemed like an intriguing idea, I was a bit skeptical that a man who has spent almost fifty years in the business directing violent gangster pictures and sweepingly violent period pieces would really be well equipped to direct something that was directed at youngsters. Add the fact that it is in 3D, and you have the first real time I had a doubt in Scorsese. Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives as an orphan rotating and setting the clocks properly at a train station near Paris post 1930s economic depression. He is caught by the local toy store shopkeeper (played by Ben Kingsley), who confiscates the sketch pad filled with inventions and ideas originally owned by Hugo's father. Hugo obviously wants to retrieve it, but there is something deeply troubling the shopkeeper. And with the help of his granddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), the pair set out to find out just what is troubling him.For all the critical praise it has and will continue to receive, it does not negate the fact that Hugo is two-thirds of a horrifically boring movie. It starts off interesting enough, but then it slows right down and barely picks itself back up. Until the subplots kicked in about the pioneering of the filmmaking medium, I had absolutely no idea where the film was going – and neither did the film. It just plays itself out without much concern, introducing characters, ideas and elements which may have proved valuable at the time, but are next to useless in the final end game. I found myself frequently questioning just what Scorsese was trying to accomplish, and found that the film was more often than not, at odds with itself. It is not a children's film by a long shot, but it is not necessarily an adult film either. There are moments of adventure and whimsy, but then there are some really dark and disturbing moments as well. It just does not know what it wants to be, and suffers as a result of it. When I am fighting the urge to pass out during one of the most highly anticipated films of the year because I am bored to tears, then there is clearly an issue.While we can blame the lack of any semblance of plot development on the source material (I have not read Selznick's novel, but it sounds like a mish-mash of ideas that barely come together), I feel that Scorsese is a talented enough director that he should have been able to see through the problems, and fix them with relative ease. He is out of his element here making his first real 'children's movie', but his craft is just as impeccable as always. Surely he could tell that he needed to make his thinly veiled plea for cinematic restoration and preservation a lot sooner and clearer than he does, right? He clearly has a passion for the material, but the film lacks that electric feel that most Scorsese films have. It lacks that jolt, that spark that really transcends the medium, and sets his work apart from everyone else's. If you had very little knowledge of the project and left Hugo before the cinema subplot kicks in, you may not even know the film was part of Scorsese's oeuvre. It may simply look like a very gorgeous film, with some intriguing characters and a total lack of a cohesive story. But for all the story related issues, I must say that the film is very impressive to look at. The sets, the costumes, and the editing style – all of it is just as incredible as we have come to expect. Scorsese knows how to make a really authentic and meticulously designed period piece, and his work here is no different. But what really makes it dazzle and come to life, rather surprisingly, is the 3D. It is generously employed throughout the film very carefully, very rarely coming off as the gimmick it inherently is. Instead, it adds depth and a stunning realism to the film. It feels like you are in the movie, experiencing what Hugo sees and feels. It may look extremely fake when it hits Blu-ray, but there is no questioning how astonishing it looks here. Seeing the clocks in action is particularly wonderful, as is the subtle use of snow outside and dust inside. And even though it is used quite frequently, you never grow tired of it. You just sit in your seat, and wait for the next effect Scorsese throws at you.Acting is strong across the board, from main players like Butterfield, Moretz, Sacha Baron Cohen and Kingsley, to bit players who serve very little purpose like Frances de la Tour, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee and Emily Mortimer, to blink-and-you-will-miss-them extended cameos like Jude Law and Ray Winstone. Everyone is on their A-game, and shines well above the dialogue and actions they are given. Particular attention needs to be played to Butterfield, who shoulders the majority of the film almost exclusively. His plight is the stuff of wonder and imagination, and would have been simply riveting had the film's content been a bit better focused. While Hugo is a positively stunning experience to view, the majority of the story leaves a lot to be imagined. Even with the great acting and wonderful 3D, the film suffers from a horrendous element of boredom constantly. When the third act kicks in, it finally figures out what it wants to be and suddenly the film becomes the masterpiece it should have been all along. I did enjoy Hugo, but this is quite simply a good movie that could have been brilliant. 8/10.",8,9,14,26 November 2011
American Beauty," Without Spacey's dazzling performance, it would just be another pretentious and amateur glorified independent film
","Almost eight years since first seeing it, I still cannot fathom why everyone was so smitten with American Beauty. There is practically nothing about it that seems relevant as to why it won a smouldering amount of critical acclaim then, and still has yet to show me why it will stand the test of time as the years go on. Instead, it still is just frighteningly average.Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is in a downward spiral. After years of living the good life, he has hit his midlife crisis. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is straying away from him and is stuck in her own rut of depression, and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) just seems to loathe his very existence. But after a new family moves in next door, and Lester meets Jane's gorgeous best friend Angela (Mena Suvari), he begins to turn his life around.The plot description really does no justice for what little good there is in the film, but it does say what is wrong with it. It is just plain uninteresting and far from blazingly original. Breaking the film right down to its plainest terms, makes it just another story about redemption. Spacey's Lester just wants to be redeemed for everything that has happened and brought him to this moment in his life, and spends the whole movie seeking that one true thing. It never bothers lingering on what was wrong in the first place, and it never makes us truly understand why he needs to make such a radical change in his life, and rip up the family unit even more so on his way doing it. Much of what Lester does is not darkly comedic, satiric or even dramatic. It comes off instead as awkward and disturbing. There is a fine line to walk between both, but this film cannot do it. Instead, it falls flat on its face right from the start, and barely ever recovers.First time director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball set out to craft the perfect take on dystopic suburbia, but really are only half baking the whole thing. What some may have taken to be perfection at its very core is strictly pretentious. There is a lot of attention given to the vivid colours in the film (used obviously to show certain emotions), but the film's underlying messages are far too mixed for any of them to actually matter. The long, straying shots only help add to the confusion that sets in rather rapidly, and its attempts at genuinely effecting moments do nothing for it. It struck me most often as an homage to ideas from the past and present, but nothing more than that. The work done here is amateur at best, and bites off more than it could ever chew. Some of the dialogue is indeed very clever, but the majority either comes off as useless or just a sheer attempt at being powerful. It only drags the movie out even further. And do not even get me started on that silly plastic bag.But while the filmmakers and the film itself meanders a bit too often, Spacey is actually quite uncompromising in his performance. He has yet to do anything since (Se7en and The Usual Suspects notwithstanding) that even remotely compares to it (unless you count his wonderfully narcissistic and deliciously evil take on Lex Luthor in Superman Returns), and I doubt he ever will. Spacey paints Lester as a closeted basket case beautifully, and at times, rises well above the screenplay and the film's limitations. He has just the right amount of dry wit and dramatic tendencies to pull off such a brilliantly written character. His voiceovers, as ridiculously pretentious as they slowly become, are reassuring and at times, poetic. His zany performance is calculating and brilliant. Never once do we as the audience see an actor, we see a man whose life is slowly deteriorating all around him. The only problem is, he outshines everyone around him, and manages to completely spell out how Ball managed to completely sidestep writing anyone else nearly as good (or just left them to the audience's own enigmatic devices). All of the other actors do as best as they can to overcome this hindering, but Spacey's presence is felt throughout, and all of the actors show it in their performances whether he is on-screen or not. They may as well have been mimes.I digress however. The film is nice on the eyes, especially when not in the dark or through the lens of a worthless videocamera disguised as a unique plot device. The score is also fairly well done. And the comeback story that takes place always makes for a rather enchanting picture (albeit one that has been told far too many times).But American Beauty's pretentious over and undertones drag it down into just being merely watchable, if only to witness Spacey chew up and spit out every last ounce of scenery and character moments. He never lets up once, and singlehandedly does the film some form of justice. There is nothing to look closer at. It is just another overpraised film that seemed relevant at the time, but has slowly began to die off since. I wish it was only Spacey's performance that won awards instead of the entire movie. It did not deserve any of its accolaids.7/10.",7,0,1,19 February 2008
Over the Hedge," An enjoyable film with a bit of everything for everyone
","Unbeknowist to me, Over the Hedge is based on a comic strip. I've never seen it, but I can only imagine that it would be just as good as the film, if not better. And while it's not an astonishment, I can say that Hedge is genuinely enjoyable, and great fun for everyone.R.J. (Bruce Willis) is a hungry raccoon, who just happens to make the mistake of his life when he tries to steal the huge supply of food that Vincent (Nick Nolte), a bear, has stored during his winter hibernation. Vincent is obviously upset, but he gives R.J. a week to collect all the food and everything that went with it, or he'll eat him. So as R.J. sets out, he comes across a new suburban area, filled with food and all of the things he needs. In the neighbouring forest, he finds a 'family' of animals, lead by Verne the turtle (Garry Shandling). They are all searching for food as well, so R.J. helps teach them things about the human world that they are unaware of, and sets out to get the food he needs.Of course, this is the main premise of the film, but it takes a few turns as all animated films do. And like many animated films before it, it has a great message, and is great for kids and adults. The film is packed with light laughs for children, and then the even bigger laughs for the adults. At the heart of the film, it's all basically about the effects of living/creating suburbia, and abusing consumerism. While it only touches on being satirical in this sense, it does offer the usual pop culture references, and many others too. And luckily, it was saved from the obligatory song and dance number that plagues other animated films.The story is well written, but feels very brisk. It starts, it continues for a bit, and then it ends. It is not as short as some films, but you can't help but wonder what more could have been done if they had a little more running time. It is a much stronger film than other Dreamworks titles like Madagascar and Shark Tale, and really seems like it can stand next to the likes of Shrek 1 and 2.The voice acting is all top-notch, from Willis' take no-nonsense raccoon, to the sadly missed Shandling as a neurotic turtle. Steve Carrell also stands out as the absolutely insane Hammy the squirrel, as does William Shatner as Ozzie the possum. As I had read before seeing the film, Shatner does an absolutely fabulous job playing possum. I couldn't stop laughing any time his character did something, it's just that great. The rest of the voice cast, from Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as parents of hedgehogs, to Wanda Sykes as a skunk, to Thomas Hayden Church as an exterminator, to Nick Nolte as Vincent the bear, all are great and well suited for their roles. They all have quite a bit of screen time, and none feel over-used at all (unlike Madagascar's blatant overuse of Ben Stiller and no one else). Of course, the random inclusion of Avril Lavinge as Shatner's daughter Heather was a little bizarre, you can see that she is at least making an attempt at voice acting here.And as usual, the animation is excellent. While not being a total improvement from the likes of other Dreamworks films, the advancements are still very noticeable. The grass, the fur, the emotions and gestures, all of them are perfectly captured, and look gorgeous on film. All the colours are great too.It's a funny movie, and a fabulous cast. It's one of the better animated films of the last few months.8/10.",8,72,80,25 May 2006
Warrior," It has some great fight scenes, but the rest is a manipulative and predictable washout
","Despite what you may have heard or read, Warrior just may be one of the most melodramatic and manipulative films ever conceived. Yes, it is a sports movie and gets a pass from most people because of the genre's varied history. But that is not nearly a good enough excuse for the dreck that Gavin O'Connor has helped concoct with this film. The Conlon family has been irreparably damaged after years of abuse at the hands of the former boxer and alcoholic patriarch Paddy (Nick Nolte). He is trying his hand at sobriety, but his estranged son Brendan (Joel Edgerton) is not ready to let Paddy get too close to his family. Other son Tommy (Tom Hardy) has just mysteriously returned from fighting in the Middle East, and recruits Paddy to help train him as an MMA fighter in order to compete in an upcoming tournament with the best fighters in the world. At the same time, Brendan, a school teacher, begins training to fight in the same tournament in order to keep a roof over his family's heads.Should the trailer not have told you already, it becomes increasingly obvious throughout Warrior's often excruciating 140-minute running time where these two brothers are heading. The film makes no bones about it, and plays through almost every single underdog trope you can imagine and even a few you may have forgotten. The notion of being subtle was apparently lost on O'Connor, and I wonder if the original script played out just as annoying and silly as the film does. The comparisons to Rocky are more than fair, because the movie practically rips off entire segments right out of that legendary Oscar winner without shame. But looking aside from the formulaic and absolutely asinine plotting structure, as well as the clear jumps in logic on the parts of almost every single cast member (specifically towards the end of the film), I think the film is most guilty of being too long, too self-indulgent and just plain boring. Warrior lacks the charisma and finesse needed to really make you forget the predictability of it all and actually care about the plight of these characters. It beats you over the head with moments dripping with pathos and sorrow, but never answers the question of why you should care. It merely goes through the motions, playing out lengthy scenes that could have easily been cut for pacing or reworked to give us a reason for watching the struggles of this collapsed family. It fails to connect on almost every level, and merely feels like a stretched out, half-baked drama that drags its heels getting to the tournament the film is building towards. Even then, it still takes its time getting to the fights. I dig Hardy as an actor and look forward to seeing him truly break out, but he does not really put any effort into Tommy. He is brooding and conceited throughout, hinting at an inner pain that is waiting to be unleashed. But he never really gets the opportunity to showcase any of it. He spends most of the movie not saying a word, and merely looking at the camera or his cast mates with saddened and hollowed eyes. His sad eyes can only do so much, and his dialogue does absolutely nothing. It looks like he took the movie merely for the chance to bulk up and prep for The Dark Knight Rises. Edgerton, who I also look forward to seeing break out, does a little better. He actually puts in the effort needed to be convincing, and even with the atrocious dialogue, comes off as genuine. He takes even the worst of moments in stride, and does almost the entirety of the heavy lifting in the film. Should the film have focused entirely on him and cut out the silly brother subplot, I think it could have worked a whole lot better.Which brings me to Nolte, who gives what is likely his best performance in over a decade. While that may be true, I find it hard to find anything to really praise about it. He appears to be playing a fragmented archetype along the lines of Mickey Rourke's character in The Wrestler. Both characters are washed up shadows of their former selves, and not surprisingly, the lives of the actors playing them mirror the roles. But instead of giving the emotional breadth and genuine authenticity needed for this character, Nolte overacts the entire way through it. He hams it up for part of the film, and in others, completely destroys any semblance of attempting to give a great performance. Instead of letting it flourish, he seems more concerned with ensuring everyone know what kind of thespian he can be when he wants to be, and ends up becoming comically bad in some scenes. When there are people laughing at your character's most deadly serious scene, not because it is funny but because the delivery is stilted and amateur, it says a lot about the character and even more about your work.But for all of its problems and everything it does so horrifically wrong, the fight scenes at the end of the film are simply magnificent. They are raw and realistic. You can feel every punch, gasp at every bone crunching submission, and practically smell the sweat coming off the mat. You can sense immediately that great pains were taken to ensure these scenes looked as authentic as possible. You become immersed in them, and feel like you are right there in the scene. Not surprisingly, I completely forgot how long I had been sitting watching Warrior because these scenes were just so breathlessly entertaining. But after wading through almost two hours of melodramatic pandering, I think they deserved to be.4/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",4,19,51,2 October 2011
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," A solid, albeit a little weary, addition to the Apatow comedy canon
","Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story chronicles the rise and fall of fictional singer Dewey Cox's (John C. Reilly), showcasing the changes in his music as each decade passes, and the struggles he faces as a musician.Just when we figured we had enough of the typical singer bio-pic, co-writer/producer/comedy golden boy Judd Apatow has delivered yet another one, albeit his first real straight on parody since he first struck gold with The 40-Year-Old Virgin. There was obviously plenty to mine here, and just the brief synopsis should evoke memories of recent Oscar-winners Walk the Line and Ray. And while a lot of the moments that pass do allow for the filmmakers to take grand shots at these two films, it also allows for plenty of satire on the state of music through the various decades, from the rise of rock and roll in the 1950's, to the hippie peace movement in the 1960's and beyond. Also added to the mix are quite a few cameos by actors playing famous musicians of the time including Frankie Muniz as Buddy Holly and Jack White as the King himself, Elvis Presley (and an absolutely laugh out loud sequence featuring The Beatles).But in packing in a lot of this material from sources that were already too bogged down in the first place, Apatow and co-writer/director Jake Kasdan have bogged themselves down to. For a movie that is under one hundred minutes, it drags a bit too much for its own good. Some sequences run endlessly long, and some just pass by with ease. I do not want to say, or incur, that I was bored at all by one of the best (if not the best) parody films in a long time (especially if I have such tripe as Meet the Spartans to look forward to in the future), it just dragged itself along too much. I understand the effect the Kasdan and Apatow were going for, but I think they could have limited themselves a little bit more. What does not help even more so is knowing that many of the trailer's scenes are cut right out of the movie, suggesting an even longer Unrated DVD (along the lines of the way too long Virgin DVD). There just does not seem to be a middle ground in the area of pacing throughout the film, and it tarnishes the film as a result.The actual material itself is fairly hysterical. There are plenty of laughs to be found at any given turn here, and many laugh out loud moments to go with them. Just watching these actors delivering their lines in purely serious ways, especially during the some of the film's most ridiculous moments (ironically, moments that fall very close to those found in Line or Ray), is just too much to not be able to laugh at. All of these actors seem very at home with the material, and look like they are having a lot of fun with their characters. This also seems to be one of the closest followed scripts of the past few Apatow films, and rarely does it appear that the characters are improvising (or they have just really improved from their consistent ad-libbing). The sets, backgrounds and costume designs, evoking the specific periods, are just as funny, if not more. There is a grand sense of authenticity at work here, and anyone watching the movie can pick out specific ties to their own memories (real or imagined) of those eras. Of course, there are a few too many nods to current fashion trends, but it stays very keenly in the area of that specific era depicted during that point in the film.Reilly as Cox is a marvel in the lead role. He brings his more refined dramatic style to the role, and I think it helps lend a certain aura of credibility to the performance. It is just as serious and realistic as Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, and only a few steps below the mastery of Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles, and Dewey Cox is not even a real person. He really makes this character his own, and when he is not being downright hilarious, without even breaking a grin, he is being heartbreakingly hysterical. It is a mixed bag, but Reilly makes it work, and he makes it work very well. His performance as the actor is only topped by his performance as the singer. He leads songs brilliantly at every point in the film, and even though the subtext of most of them is a bit risqué, they are still wonderfully written songs sung by someone with a great voice. If this role does not spring board Reilly into more leading actor work, it just may give him the needed boost to be a singer (or at least, to do more musicals or head to Broadway).The supporting cast, although not nearly as funny as Reilly, all lend a hand in making Walk Hard a very funny movie. From Kristen Wiig and Jenna Fischer as Cox's wives, to Tim Meadows, Chris Parnell, and Matt Besser as his band mates, to Raymond J. Barry as his father, everyone manages to steal a scene for themselves, and manages to deliver some solid laughs. Yes, there are quite a few flat jokes that are given by the supporters much more often than Reilly as the lead, but for the most part, they do a great job backing him up. It also helps that it seems like everyone has some sort of minuscule amount of chemistry with Reilly, allowing their jokes to fly very easily.Despite its faults, Walk Hard is a solid addition to the growing canon of Apatow comedies, and is one hell of a funny parody. Reilly was the best man for this role, and I am happy to say that he makes the film more than just watchable.7.5/10.",7,5,12,21 December 2007
Disturbia," Problems aside, the film is an effective and solid thriller
","Kale (Shia LaBeouf) is a troubled teen, and seems to not be learning any lessons. A provoked assault leads him to court, where he is sentenced to house arrest for three months, and is fitted with an ankle monitor ensuring he is not going anywhere. He slowly begins to grow bored, and eventually, begins to spy on his neighbours. While he begins to take a liking to Ashley (Sarah Roemer), the new girl next door, he begins to suspect another neighbour, Robert Turner (David Morse), may be a serial killer.When I first saw the trailer, I immediately equated Disturbia together with Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (and all of the classic imitations and parodies that have come with it since its debut well over fifty years ago. And while it does follow some very familiar ground in its premise, Disturbia actually turned out to be much more than a simple re-imagining for the teenage crowd in the 2000's.For one, Disturbia is more thrilling than you could imagine. Yes, it is highly predictable (although the opening ten minutes, if you know very little about the film, may come as a surprise), but that does not stop it from keeping you on alert for almost the entirety of the last third of the film. It does a lot of building up to certain moments, and when they hit, they hit rapidly and do not stop coming. It is suspenseful right to its core, and does not feel like it is trying too hard to be like so many other teenage thrillers. It is not particularly scary in most respects however (unless you are a bit too easily jumpy), but for what it sets out to accomplish, it does a very good job.What may prove to be bothersome is the fact that the film takes a bit too long to build towards the actual spying Kale does after he begins to suspect Turner as a killer. He is not introduced as any character of importance until well into the film, and after he is, it takes another little while before he really begins to do anything for it. Instead, we have to endure through Kale slowly losing his sanity (and never once really using the Internet, despite it and the living room cable TV being the only thing his mother Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) does not seem to take away) and almost stalking Ashley. I realize that they want to flesh out Kale as much as they can, but there is only so much that can be done before the film becomes overly tedious with its fleshing out. The creepy voyeur aspect to the film is a little weird to accept at times, but its merit as a social satire is quite intriguing nonetheless. And when Morse finally gets to chew up some screen time, the film does not want to let him, and almost forces him to continue to stay in the background.And speaking of Moss's character, what purpose does she serve in any of this? She has a point in the ending, and she serves a point to take away Kale's X-Box Live and iTunes accounts (at least the product placement does not get nearly as bad as in Transformers), but does not do much else. Her character has basically no motivations, and when she gets a little bit of the emotional material in the film, you do not know whether it is worth feeling for her or just wishing they completely cut her out of the film entirely. Much the same goes for the annoying Jose Pablo Cantillo playing Officer Gutierrez, the police officer who always seems to be on hand if Kale steps out of his proximity zone. He gives the film a few laughs, but is pretty much useless in the grand scheme of things.I do like what they tried to do with the story and the focus on Kale's character, but I think they could have tightened a bit further by losing some of his exposition and making Turner's a little more honed in (so when the inevitability of the predictable moments begin, there is more to him than the plainly obvious things). This is a movie with a very small cast of speaking roles, and they easily could have shifted things around and reworked certain moments in the film to be a lot more synthetic than others. As said previously, I was actually kind of surprised with how much better the film was than I ever would have assumed, so these gripes could have only made the film all the better than it already is.LaBeouf does very well as the main character. He has a certain likability about him that makes us genuinely invested in what his character feels and does throughout the film, and he never once loses it. He makes the character very believable, and lends him a certain aura of authenticity. This is a character that LaBeouf could actually be like in real life, and it shows in how easy it seems for him to be acting within the role (and how he is not straining so hard like he does in Transfomers).Morse, as always, does very well in his role. I do not want to spoil his most meaty scenes, but suffice to say, he is very kind and terrifyingly frightening all at once. He easily switches from emotion to emotion like someone is flicking a lightswitch, and much like LaBeouf, makes the role believable and real.Roemer, Moss and Aaron Yoo as Kale's friend Ronnie all put in worthwhile performances that only further complement the work done by LaBeouf and Morse. Each (especially Moss) could have done with a little bit more exposition though.As much as I hate to say it, I was rather impressed with Disturbia. It is an effective thriller with a few problems, but is otherwise quite a worthwhile watch.7.5/10.",7,0,1,19 February 2008
Dreamgirls," Hudson is magnificent, but the film is too uneven
","For anyone who follows movies and the awards season, Dreamgirls was one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. It was the frontrunner for Best Picture from the start, and only continued to pull in steam as Oscar season came closer. While some of that steam has worn off a bit, the film is still one of the frontrunners, and is still pulling in lots of buzz. After an overextended limited theatrical release, the film has finally gone wide, and thus, gave me the opportunity to see it.I was skeptical about the film, not being a huge fan of musicals and all. But surprisingly, it was better than I thought it would be. But even with that statement, I am still a little conflicted about the film as a whole.For the uneducated, the film is based on a popular award-winning musical from 1981. It is fictional, but is based in fact. After narrowly losing a talent contest, the three members of the Dreamettes, Deena (BeyoncÃ© Knowles), Lorell (Anika Noni Rose) and lead singer Effie (Jennifer Hudson), are signed to a contract by Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx). Despite Effie's complaints, they become back-up singers to popular singer Jimmy 'Thunder' Early (Eddie Murphy), and soon after, become their own group. But as the group becomes more famous, relationships begin to dissolve and betrayal and heartbreak begin to become more predominant.The most noteworthy thing about the film is exactly what all the critics have been saying: Hudson's earth-shattering performance as Effie White. Watching her perform made me think the title of the film really should have been A Star is Born, her performance really is that great. Her angry diva-licious role is done with such a high-degree of perfection that it really is hard to believe that all she has done other than this film is American Idol. Her acting chops are well refined, and easily make her the best member of the cast. She brings soul and genuine emotion to her character, and makes the role absolutely unforgettable. Her singing voice is even better, and even stronger than the excellent acting. When she belts out 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going' halfway through the film, everything and everyone bows down to her.But this is a large problem for the rest of the film.The first half before the song comes is fast-paced, and practically flies by. Bill Condon and company really immerse you in the action and drama of what is going on, and really churn out an excellent movie. Songs besides Hudson's big number are all catchy and well converted to the screen. The costumes, set designs and choreography are above excellent, and the editing is absolutely wonderful. But after the song, the film just loses any sense of speed it had, and instead, just drags along quite painfully at times. It feels like it just stopped knowing where to focus everything, and just decided to try and concentrate on anything it possibly could. And even then, they miss key plot elements and characters in favour of others that are not so key to the rest of the film. It feels awkward, and having not seen the musical on Broadway, I am unsure if I should blame the source material, or blame Condon's script. Thankfully none of the artistic elements fail (save for the really inane fade outs), but the loss of focus really hurts the movie.Another issue are the leads in the film.Hudson can only do so much, and even with stealing scenes left, right and centre, she cannot hold the weight up of everyone else. Knowles and Foxx, despite being the lead actors, are completely overshadowed by everyone. Their singing is not up to par, their acting (although better than expected) is not up to par, and their hearts just do not seem to be in the film as much as everyone else's. They look like they could have easily been replaced by lesser known stars, and had their roles actually mean something to the film. As it stands, they just look like background characters that are integral to the story, but just do not have the importance that they should.Murphy is disappointing as Early, because despite the critical praise, he is basically playing himself. Early thinks is stubborn, egotistical, and washed up. That is basically the picture the media paints of Murphy, so would you not think he would do well for himself playing a role that is so close to his actual self? Truth be told, he really is not in the movie a whole lengthy amount of time, and does nothing all too fascinating when he is.I actually was a lot more impressed by the underrated Rose and television regular Keith Robinson as lyricist C.C. Robinson. Both are supporting characters, but they command the screen when they are front and centre. Their acting is great, and they really help make their characters stick out. They are nowhere near as strong as Hudson, but their acting helps complement her amazing performance. In a way, they make up for the fumble of the main three, but on the other hand, prove that having a lesser known cast probably could have helped the film be much more powerful. Small roles from Danny Glover and Hinton Battle are also well done (as is an amusing cameo by Jaleel White).When I said I was conflicted, I was not kidding. On one hand, we have a film that has amazing technical feats, a memorable supporting cast and a star-making turn from Hudson. But on the other, the main cast really is subpar, and the film becomes tedious and boring in the second half. If it had stayed consistent, I think I could have justifiably given this film the blessing to win Best Picture. But as it stands, it just does not feel like a worthy winner.7/10.",7,2,4,19 January 2007
Face_Off," A clever trade-off of action and emotion that still feels relevant
","Sean Archer (John Travolta), a senior FBI agent, has been tracking Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) for years. Besides wanting to take him down for his terrorist crimes, Archer also has revenge in mind, as Troy accidentally murdered Archer's son years earlier in a botched assassination attempt. But shortly after finally capturing him in a comatose, he learns of a bomb that has been planted within Los Angeles, and only Troy knows where it is. So, with the aid of brilliant science, Archer trades faces with Troy, and goes undercover in prison to try and find out how to stop the bomb from Troy's brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola). But things take a turn for the worst when Troy shows up with Archer's face.Yes, this synopsis may sound a bit convoluted and murky, but the film makes it work at almost every hairpin turn. In fact, that is half the fun of the film. I watched this film when I was a kid, and loved it. And nothing has changed in ten years. Through every suspense filled moment, the film packs on one hell of a wallop, both through its clever trade-off of action and emotion. Yes, it has its moments where things happen that clearly never can, but the rest of this dead serious romp is very much based heavily in the real (and the predicted real). Indeed some of the thrilling stunts are right in tune with the usual crap spoon fed by Michael Bay (who actually directed Cage in his best work to date, The Rock, just before this film), but the majority of the actions that these characters do are based quite blatantly in the real world.The stunts and action set pieces are all brilliantly constructed from head to toe, and never once does anything look fake. It has all the trimmings of a John Woo film, from the pigeons to the double handed gun fights to the grand explosions to even the elevated use of slow motion, and never once does it take itself for granted. Right from the scene in the chase/shootout scene in the airport hanger that begins right after the credits conclude, you know you are in the hands of a master action storyteller. Woo takes great pride in how he envisions and creates his sequences, and every single scene action-packed or not, has that aura about it. Unlike the aforementioned Bay or even The Wachowskis, every detail looks perfectly thought out and even more perfectly directed. It is hard to spot blemishes in everything that is going on, and even harder to pick out the fabricated from the realistic (considering how little an amount of CGI is actually used in the film).But the real drive of the film is in the acting, and it is fairly well done across the board. Both Travolta and Cage are clearly above the material, but they do a wonderful job conveying most of the absolutely devastating emotions shown throughout the film. Both play off of each other well, and both do an even better job aping the other's performance. While I did really enjoy Cage here (more so as the good guy), it is Travolta who gives the better performance. He just brings such an evil zest to the Troy role that we never really get to see as an audience. Yeah, he was over-the-top in Broken Arrow, fabulously poignant in Pulp Fiction, and at one of his all-time highs in Swordfish, but his deliciously evil turn here is what really shows off his talent and range. The otherwise all around good guy playing someone who is the quintessentially evil bad-ass. His every delivery just has that solid, methodical brilliance to it, and seeing it again was a real treat.Supporting turns from Joan Allen as Archer's wife, Dominique Swain as Archer's daughter, Gina Gershon as Troy's moll and Nivola are all particularly well acted. Yes, they are overshadowed by the two main characters, but they put in some fine performances all on their own.What kills the movie a little are some of the blatant plot-holes, inconsistencies and some really goofy dialogue (that stupid hand thing still bothers me too). I understand some of the movie should be tongue-in-cheek, but some of the scenes just got a little out of control. Just the sheer idea of swapping faces is a frightening idea all in itself. But then why does no one quite grasp the changes that these characters are clearly going through? Why do we not even know more than just a slight backstory on neither Archer nor Troy? Questions like these bothered me ever since I first saw the film so many years ago, and they only continue to echo. I understand the whole movie hinges on the idea of revenge for Archer's son's murder and everyone not knowing the truth except Archer and Troy, but some of their actions are just far too bizarre for someone to not notice. This may be a problem having changed the script so vastly from its original science-fiction form, but it just never quite jives as easy as it should.I must admit, even though it is quite obviously an action film, Face/Off will always so much more than that. The undertones that run throughout the film are so heavily dramatic, that if you take away the action scenes, you still could have a taut and calculating character drama. The painstaking work done by Woo and his crew to make this film so much more original than it could have been is crystal clear throughout the film. Its sheer predictions of a dystopic face swapping ability is enough to make the film valid and not dated in the current year, but at the same time, shows just how imaginative movies used to be. Problems or not, I can only hope that Face/Off continues to stand the test of time.8/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",8,2,4,9 September 2007
Jarhead," Underrated with a sense of originality
","Sam Mendes was a wonder kid. He managed to pull in five Oscars for his debut feature, American Beauty, including Best Picture and Best Director. I was never a big fan of the film, but nevertheless, stood in awe at the achievement. Luckily, I fared better with his fantastic follow-up Road to Perdition. Of course, it only pulled in one Oscar (for the astonishing cinematography of course). When his third film, Jarhead, came out last year, I was fairly enthusiastic. I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, but it did not seem to be a shared sentiment among others. After watching it a second time, I have realized that it was still as good as the first time I saw it.The film starts off with Swoff (Jake Gyllenhaal) in boot camp. The scene is fairly Full Metal Jacket-esquire with the abusive drill sergeant, and the recruits not really knowing how to handle it. This quickly moves into Swoff being deployed to marine training with his new staff sergeant (Jamie Foxx). After going through his extended training, the troops are sent out to Iraq to become ready for what would become Operation: Desert Storm. None of the troops in the desert believe they will be there for very long, but they get more than they ask for.I really am still unsure what people did not like about this movie. There were great performances from Foxx, Peter Sarsgaard, a great cameo from Chris Cooper, and a much more Oscar worthy performance from Gyllenhaal. The editing, cinematography and screenplay are all top notch, and feel genuine in their sentiments of making the deserts of Iraq feel totally real (and it frightens me to know that there are parts of California, where they shot the film, that look like that). Mendes continued his streak of directing great films, and it looked like the film would pull in at least a few nominations come Oscar time.But the film came and went, and it really just seemed like they had finally rejected the wonder kid.There are numerous ideas as to why this happened, but none strikes me as a possible explanation more than it being advertised as a war film, and being more about the people in the war, than the war itself.All wars are the same, and all are just as senseless as the next. We have learned this through history and Mendes amps this ideal up throughout the entirety of the film. The troops get pumped up for going to Iraq by watching the village bombing scene from Apocalypse Now. They even hum along to the 'Rise of the Valkyries'. A marine gets The Deer Hunter sent to him while he's stationed in Iraq, and everyone crowds around to watch it. Swoff and others get upset going through the desert, and having helicopters fly by playing music from the Vietnam war. They want an original war, but they know they cannot have it. Going on would only ruin what happens as the film progresses.Yes, the film has its boring points. And yes, the pacing is not consistent in many sequences. But Mendes wanted to be different, and he managed to pull it off. It just seems like no one liked his real attempt at originality. But do not let the bad reviews allow you to not see this fine work. If anything, let it make you want to see it more. It's a great film, and is heavily underrated. I can only hope it becomes more appreciated in time.9/10.",9,1,3,3 June 2006
Ratatouille," A great animated fable packed with enthusiasm and absolutely amazing animation
","After last year's horrendously average and overrated Cars, I was unsure how to approach Ratatouille. It looked impressive, and it looked like another great entry into the Pixar/Disney lineup. But then, so too did Cars. But something about Ratatouille struck me as immediate, as something that needed to be seen now and not simmered over later. And thankfully, albeit with a few minor flaws, the film comes out as being just as excellent as I could have hoped.Ratatouille tells the story of Remy (voiced by Patton Oswalt), a rat who has a keen sense of smell. So keen, that he outright refuses to eat just about anything that his rat colony/family finds in the dumpsters or just laying around. He is put to good use as the poison checker for the colony, but still chooses to search out good food, and not just anything. He dreams of being a famous chef, but is hindered by the fact that he is a rat.What follows is a bitter sweet story of just finding the place to belong. I will forego the mention of the various subplots and surprises, but I will incur that Remy does meet up with the lousy cook Linguini (Lou Ramano), and the two become partners in cooking at the famous Gusteau's Restaurant (as just about anyone who knows anything about the movie can tell you).Even with its bizarre storyline, and even more bizarre main character, Ratatouille is a treat from start to finish. Never once did I not feel like I was watching something from anyone other than a master storyteller, and even at its most fantastical moments, Ratatouille warms with animated joy at just the thought of continuing the storyline. Unlike many other animated films that go around in circles over its simplistic plot and overused morality tale, Ratatouille takes its moral tale, and wraps it around all sorts of plot elements. Children will love it for how comical and cutesy it is, but the adults will love it just for how layered and dense the story is.What it also packs is a wallop of enthusiasm totally devoid from almost the entirety of Cars. While the former moved along slower than animated movie I have ever seen, and was dull right to its very core, Ratatouille is exactly the opposite. It runs at just the right pace throughout the film, and each and every actor delivers their lines with finesse and conviction. They are devoted to these roles wholeheartedly, and are putting some actual effort into their lines. It may help that the majority of these actors are not big time Hollywood superstars, but what also may help is the fact that they all seem to have an interest in these characters and this story, and are not just in it for the paycheque at the end of the voice sessions. They are all clearly having fun with it. Even Peter O'Toole, who plays the menacingly wicked food critic Anton Ego, seems to be amused by his role.In fact, all of the voice actors do great with their roles. Oswalt gives a great balance of naivety, desire and pathos to his main character. I know there was some trouble trying to market the idea of a rat trying to make it in the human world, but I think Oswalt's voice skills helped greatly flatten this idea out into something great. Ramano also does great as Linguini, giving just the right amount of struggle in his voice to truly make his neurotic character truly interesting. Supporting turns from O'Toole, Brad Garrett, Janeane Garofolo, James Remar, and in particular, Ian Holm, are all very well done, and help make the film truly wonderful. Their French accents are all quite amusing. I also liked the small addition of John Ratzenberger, always a great voice to hear in a Pixar movie.The only thing that harms the film is that it runs too long. Director/Screenwriter Brad Bird had this same issue with his other excellent Pixar film (and Oscar winner), The Incredibles. Both pack in so much, and as a result, drag in places that should be more fairly fast paced. Here, these dragging scenes take place near the beginning (Remy does not meet up with Linguini until at least a half hour into the film), and part-way through the middle. All the elements are there, they just do not all add up into something blazingly fast paced. I can appreciate all of the little things Bird is doing to make the film appeal to more than just the children in the audience, but he almost lost me a few times doing it. A little bit of extra trimming could have helped avoid this problem.The animation on the other hand, is brilliant. There is no other word to describe it. Just the one scene where Remy realizes that he is in Paris, and overlooks the entire Parisian skyline, is enough reason to see the film. It looks fantastic in every scene, and never does the beautifully rendered scenery or characters look any less amazing than they did in the scene before. Pixar has really fine-tuned their style over the years, and it shows in how astonishing these characters look, even down to the minuscule little details like a few stubbly hairs on Linguini's chin. It just looks that realistic.On the whole, Ratatouille is not a perfect film, but it is still far greater than the likes of Cars or even this year's Shrek the Third. It was clearly put together so lovingly, and created with so much care that it cannot be seen as anything less than great. The animation, the story and the voice acting all come together to create what is probably going to be one of the best animated films of this or any year.8/10.",8,4,6,30 July 2007
Goon," A lot of fun when you embrace the ridiculousness of it all
","I plead ignorance: I have never seen Slap Shot, the holy grail of non- Mighty Ducks hockey films. When I ventured into the world premiere of Michael Dowse's Goon over a month ago at the Toronto International Film Festival, I felt like I missed out on required reading. But while it may be deeply indebted to the Paul Newman classic, I think Goon still manages to be unique enough that it works pretty well on its own. Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott) is a loser. His father and brother are doctors, yet he is stuck as a bouncer in a seedy Orangetown bar. A rather heinous act of self-defense at a local hockey game gets him noticed and brought in to play in the minors as a goon, someone who fights with others and protects his smaller teammates. He does so incredibly well that he is quickly drafted to a semi-professional team in Canada, where his main goal is to protect star player Xavier LaFlamme (Marc-Andre Grondin), who has not played the same since a brutal hit from the legendary Ross 'The Boss' Rhea (Live Schreiber).Goon is the type of movie that begs not to be taken seriously. If the synopsis was not enough, then the key opening shot, a bloody tooth falling in slow motion over classical music, is an obvious suggestion of the borderline ludicrous film that follows. There is nothing subtle that occurs at all, everything is incredibly blatant and wildly over-the-top (and frequently incredibly gritty and disgusting). The film wears its pride for the sport on its sleeve, and sometimes goes to ridiculous lengths to make sure you always know that. While hockey seems to be an oddly frequent theme in Canadian pictures in the past year or so, this was the first one I saw that had the sport front and centre – not simply existing as an underlying theme or plot device. But what sets it apart from the other Canadian hockey films is its glorification of violence and carnage on ice. Glatt's main objective is to destroy and take out the other players, and everyone around him is constantly stressing that. While we get to witness the struggle he has trying to understand if there will ever be anything more for him, the film still paints him in the corner of always needing to fight, which leads to some horrifically bloody battles. Dowse does not shy away from how violent the sport can be; instead he makes it incredibly gratuitous and takes it dangerously close to the limits of decency. I laughed at how silly the violence became, but I was surprised at just how gory it was in many instances. It will no doubt cause a minor controversy, and I would not be surprised if a lot of people ignore the fact that the film is one of the few to actually deal with the topic head-on.Goon is also set apart through its rather colourful use of profanity, specifically at the hands of Jay Baruchel's Pat Houlihan. He adapted and co-wrote the script with Seth Rogen's usual writing partner Evan Goldberg , and spices up almost every line with a unique expletive. Some are too overdone for their own good, but others are near perfect. They lead to some rather hysterical one-liners more often than not, and help shape the film around the hockey. I found it particularly amusing that Baruchel gets to be the most vulgar of anyone in the script, allowing him to provide the most laughs and steal scenes from everyone. It also makes the film, at least in my mind, a bit more authentic to the sport itself. It can be family orientated as some films have tried to suggest, but it is much more at ease when it is adult.If I hold anything against the film (outside of the ending I wanted so much more from), it is that no one is really developed at all. We get to see a few different shades of Scott's Glatt, but no one else in the film changes. They are one-dimensional all around, with some minor throwaway moments that could have been used to better characterize them. It feels like a missed opportunity, even with the short running time, and nearly puts the talented cast to waste. Even Scott himself seems to be having trouble trying to really make something of his character. They all make the most of what they are given, but it seems like the acting must have come a close third to the sensationalizing of hockey and the glorifying of violence.That said, Scott does a lot better in the role than I want to give him credit for. He is very meek throughout, and is always downplaying the character. He is the complete opposite of Stifler, and shows that he has some range. Schreiber is great as Ross, but he leaves the film for far too many interludes. Same goes for Kim Coates as the head coach of Glatt's team, who never appears on screen for nearly long enough. Sadly, Grondin and Alison Pill, as Glatt's love interest, seem to fare the worst of anyone. They get so very little to do, despite their importance in the film. They just end up looking awkward and out of place more often than not, almost like they do not belong at all.In the end, there is a lot of fun to be had watching Goon, especially if you really embrace the ridiculousness of it all. It is a really silly film, but manages to be enjoyable even with the massive flaws that plague it. With a little more work, it could have been one of the best sports movies ever. Instead, it will have to contend with being the best among a long string of Canadian hockey movies that will hopefully end sooner rather than later.7/10.",7,74,109,31 October 2011
Saw III," Better than Saw II, but ultimately not satisfying enough
","I had wanted to see Saw III when it was in theatres, but never managed to get a chance to go and see it. When it came on DVD, I attempted to rent it right away, but was too busy and all the copies were always sold out. So I had to wait until now to finally get my chance. And despite the simplistic content of the film, I am still really conflicted about it more than a day after seeing it.Opening with a rather bizarre string of 'character tie-ups' (and two not-so elaborate death sequences), the actual key characters in the film are not introduced for the first fifteen minutes at least. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is on his deathbed. So a brain surgeon, Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) is kidnapped and put into a game where she would have to keep him alive, or will end up dying with him. At the same time, Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) is being put into multiple tests to see if he can conquer his ultimate fear.Simply put, Saw III is not as good as the original film, but does improve in a few areas over its disappointing predecessor. The film is focused on a small number of characters this time around, and does not make the audience try and feel for more than a half dozen like the previous film. As a result, it feels more focused when these characters are on screen, and allows for more character development. Of course, we do not hear a lot of it until the film's dying minutes (much akin to the other films), but it feels like a vast and much needed improvement.The performances are also much better done here. Even though he is stuck in a bed for most of his scenes, Bell proves to be the most menacing and evil dying film character ever. All of the fear and chills he has given in the past, is all present here, and never wasted. Just looking at his sad and twisted body, now heavily dependent on oxygen, as he is introduced to Lynn, is just terrifying. Shawnee Smith, who returns as Amanda, is also very good. I did not like how emotionally twisted she was at first, but as the film goes on, her actions make a lot more sense and feel much more authentic and proper. Newbies Soomekh and Macfadyen do an adequate job in their roles, with Macfadyen really pulling in the brunt of the emotional sequences. They deliver, but are overshadowed by how good Bell and Smith are.But they are also overshadowed by the fact that the movie, while being about their struggle to compete in Jigsaw's twisted games, is not about them. It serves more as a backgrounder on the events of the first two films, filling in the gaps of logic and questions that many of us have had since seeing the films. I will not ruin all of the surprises that the film reveals, but there is a lot of back story covered for both Jigsaw and Amanda. It was a nice touch to also have former game 'players' Leigh Whannell (Adam in the first film) and Donnie Wahlberg (Detective Matthews from the second film) return for a bit of background on what happened to their characters (no Cary Elwes appearances though). Having so much historical background material though, takes away much of what is happening in the present, and makes it take a bit of a backseat in a lot of cases. These events are just nowhere near as important, and their lack of definition is felt throughout the movie, right up to the ending, which fails to deliver like the other two films as a result of this.Another thing I resented was how mean-spirited and violent the film was. Yes, the previous two films had their shares of gruesome violence, but the limits are really being tested here. The death and the torture scenes just do not feel 'fun' anymore (for lack of better terminology). What impressed us about the originality of the violent ends in the first two films, feels a lot more dull and half baked here. Yes, they are still intriguing ways to kill, but they just do not feel like they are on the same level. On the same token, the blood seems to have been anted up to help compensate for the loss. I cringed in a few sequences, and in others, I just felt like the gore was being way too overdone. It was bordering on the self-parody of Hostel for much of the film, and considering how horrendous that movie was, is not much of a complement.As well, the whole scheme and meaning of the games that Jigsaw tests people with has been changed all around. What we are meant to believe in the first two films, is not the true meaning given in the third. It takes away a bit of the morality felt throughout the first two films, and just gives into the mindless excess of every other horror film being released every few weeks. What was original and unique, gave in to becoming mainstream. The deaths were characteristic, and had importance. Here, they just feel like they are being done just for the sake of it. There is no love or emotional attachment to anyone, because they are introduced and last even less time after.Some people may have liked some of the liberal changes made in this film from the previous two, but I really think it took away from the mythos and emotional appeal that made the films so uniquely successful in the first place. I appreciated how much light was shed on some of the questions I had about the other two films, but on the other hand, I was not completely satisfied in the end. I just hope Saw IV is not exactly the same.7/10.",7,0,0,22 March 2007
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Edgar Wright's precious little movie
","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty-something slacker living in Toronto, who basically leeches off his friends. Despite being in a 'relationship' with Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), he keeps dreaming about another girl. He quickly finds out this dream girl, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is actually quite real, and decides to pursue her. But before they can truly become the couple Scott hopes for, he has to defeat her seven evil exes.I did not think it was possible, but Edgar Wright has fairly successfully brought Bryan Lee O'Malley's epic graphic novel series to the big screen in the most uniquely entertaining way possible. It is his first adapted work, but it feels every bit as fresh (I use that word very loosely) as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz did upon their initial releases. It deviates from the books a bit (much like Matthew Vaughn's excellent adaptation of Kick-Ass earlier this year), but the majority of the film stays true to the series and gives the fans everything they might expect from a Scott Pilgrim film. Right after the film opening with an 8-bit Universal logo and score, you know you are in for a treat.What propels Wright's epic and inspired vision is the editing style. All of the little idiosyncrasies, background/foreground items and ideas, everything that made O'Malley's books so revered in the graphic novel community are all in full force here. Some shots in the trailers suggest the comic book-style feel of the film, with the sounds of the actions appearing as words on-screen and the video game-related pop-ups appearing the same way they would in the game. But that is only the start. The entire film is filled with them, and with references to numerous pop culture entities (specifically video games), to the point that it looks and sounds like a ridiculously enhanced motion comic or game. Add to that the quick cuts and multiple panel style of the format, and you have the closest film representation of a comic since Robert Rodriguez attacked Frank Miller's Sin City.Even with all the nods and references to the original work, Wright's film still feels very much his own work. He makes Scott Pilgrim's epic quest to defeat Ramona's exes into an understated work you will likely not see replicated too soon. After seeing Christopher Nolan's Inception just under a week ago, I did not think that mainstream Hollywood would release something so blazingly original and something so astonishly unique so close together. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is not nearly as strong a film as Nolan's masterpiece is, but Wright has clearly given it his all here. He has sidestepped away from following the lead of other comic book/graphic novel-style films, and has created something he can truly be proud of. The visuals on display are simply remarkable, and are worth the price of a ticket all on their own. The musical choices are even better. If you have seen the trailers, you are merely only getting a hint for what Wright has in store for you here.If I do have an issue, it is that the film is a little too exposition-heavy in the first half, and way too jumpy in the second. It never loses its tone or its style, but it becomes all too blatantly obvious where the books stop and the deviation begins. The pacing here is also a touch off, and on further research, thoroughly suggests there is material missing or altered from the final cut of the film. I understand that Wright and his co-writer Michael Bacall wanted to set-up the story and where it plans on going for the few who venture into the film without having read a single issue, but there is too much detail given in those early scenes, and not enough to pivotal moments later in the film.Another gripe, although it is one I hope will be less bothersome on repeat viewings, is that a good chunk of the characters feel incredibly underused. The books are stacked to the brim with an eclectic mix of supporting characters, who are present in the film, but they feel very stunted and get absolutely no development. Kim Pine (Alison Pill) is a very important character in the books, but she merely appears in the background here and delivers some of the best dialogue. Wallace Wells (the absolutely incredible scene-stealer Kieran Culkin) is the moral centre and source of an incredible amount of exposition, but he is barely in the film after the first half. Envy Adams (Brie Larson) almost feels like an extended cameo as opposed to an indispensible figure in Scott's character development. But then, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh and especially Jason Schwartzman all deliver stunning performances as three of Ramona's exes, despite the lack of time on-screen.Cera on the other hand, is perfect as Pilgrim. The character plays a little too close to his stereotypical neurotic and off-centre archetype, but it works out beautifully here. He makes the character real, and brings a depth to Scott Pilgrim that no other young actor could. He has the right look and the right sound down pat. It was a little weird to see him get so physical in some sequences, but this is a vintage fit for Cera. Although they are downplayed more than I liked, Winstead and Wong are great as Ramona and Knives. They both have a certain edge throughout the film, and even at its most ridiculous, deliver strong performances. It helps too that they have insanely good chemistry with Cera.I jumped at the idea of an advanced screening of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and I do not regret seeing the film in the slightest. It is a bit of a niche movie, but it is one that is lovingly made through and through.8/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",8,24,57,28 July 2010
Quantum of Solace," A barrage of action and thrills sacrifices plot and development
","In a year of disappointments, Quantum of Solace is no different.Picking up moments after the finale of Casino Royale, Quantum follows James Bond (Daniel Craig) as he tries to discover more about a mysterious organization (codenamed, obviously, QUANTUM), and the shady dealings of 'philanthropist' Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric).I am not sure if I was expecting a bit too much after the greatness (minus the finale) of Casino Royale, but this film feels miles apart from it. Despite having Paul Haggis back in the writer's chair, Craig acting as Bond again, and critical acclaim sensation Marc Forster behind the camera, the film just lacks the spark that made Royale so interesting.For one, the film has little to no plot taking place. While Royale was heavy on story and plot, Quantum allows this to totally take a back seat to the action. It takes about a half hour before the players (minus Craig) start moving towards a mere suggestion of what the film regards, and even then, it takes the rest of the movie to put it all together. Not because it is such a complex plot, but because we are only given momentary exchanges of dialogue before something else happens. And with little focus on plot comes even less on development. You know Bond's motives if you have seen Royale. But if you skipped that one, you will be totally lost attempting to decipher what he is doing. The main Bond girl, Camille (Olga Kurylenko), takes the entirety of the movie to reveal her motives. Supporting characters like Amalric's Greene get the mere moments between action scenes to get his bits in, but at the expense of developing even less than Mads Mikkelson's unabashedly underdeveloped Le Chiffre.The action scenes, while choreographed amazingly well, seem to take away from the film. Opening with a high speed car chase, the film never takes a moment to breathe before another action scene takes place. The first forty minutes amount to more than half the time focusing on action, and very little given to any dialogue or story. Sure, the action junkie will be reveling in their glory, but everyone else might feel like the film is being a bit tedious and underhanded with what they want to do for the remaining time. It feels like the majority of time was spent here, and everyone just forgot to add in the gaps to fill the moments between action scenes. I realize that an obvious complaint of Casino Royale was how slow moving and not-so-action-orientated it was, but that does not mean it is acceptable to do away with everything else just to run at a totally break-neck pace and filling in more action as it goes along.The editing is a bit problematic as well. In a scene taking place after the brazenly bizarre credits, the shots are cut so quick that it is nearly impossible to see who is doing what. This was a problem with some scenes in Batman Begins, but at least those characters did not start to blend into each other as the scenes went on. It continues to be quickly edited as the film progresses, but by then it is too late to fix anything. I realize the filmmakers had wanted to make a quick, painless sequel (the first official one in the never-ending Bond saga), but it feels like more of a last minute Director's Cut addition to Casino Royale than anything else.Craig, in his second round as Bond, suffers because the film paints him into a corner of being an unapologetic revenge seeking bad ass, and nothing else. Even during the minor slow moments where Bond is clearly searching for clarity, he still gets no time to make himself appear as anything different. The gritty and heavily masculine touch of the character is amped heavily here, and makes it very hard for Craig to really prove his performance chops. He does not fumble at all like I imagined he would, but he is not overly impressive either. He never even gets a chance to say the trademark 'Bond, James Bond' line at any point because of how fast-paced the film is. He does what he can, but the proclamations of his being the best Bond ever appear to have been heavily exaggerated.Kurylenko and Amalric both turn in convincing performances as the Bond girl and Bond villain respectively, but neither get the opportunity to really chew on any scenery. Kurylenko spends most of the film sobbing, or looking helpless or angry, while Amalric adds next to nothing as a villain. For the majority of the film, having a cardboard cutout replace him probably would not have made much of a difference on the overall impact of the film. Jeffrey Wright returns, and gets even less to do than before, and Judi Dench is again given the chance to play M, and to great effect here. As Bond slowly becomes more involved trying to discover the facts of the company, Dench gets more involved with what is going on. It makes for some interesting banter between her and Craig, and provides a much needed social and contemporary context to a character sadly missing any real traits.The film is not a bad film in the least. The action sequences (or at least, most of them) are quite thrilling, and translate well on screen. The story, when something is actually being said, is quite unique and interesting to these times. Craig's acting even does some form of good at some points. An homage to Goldfinger was also particularly well done.I just think I went in expecting far too much from Quantum of Solace. Granted you can take partial plot holes, very little story or plot, a whole plethora of action, and Craig looking like Craig, you may truly enjoy it. But for everyone else, you may be out of luck.6/10.",6,2,5,15 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," A hauntingly flawed unconventional masterpiece
","Days after seeing it, I am still haunted by No Country for Old Men. There is just something so effectual and uncompromising about it, that mere words will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display.At its most simplistic, the film is a game of cat and mouse. The mouse here is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon two million in cash after a drug deal gone wrong, and takes it thinking nothing of it. He tries to cover his tracks, but ends up letting the group looking for the money, figure out his identity. The cat is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hit-man hired to find Moss and the money. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane. And another man, a law man this time, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), is on the trail of both men as they criss-cross around Texas.Right up until its dénouement, the film is simply brilliant. Taut and thrilling, it blows right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease. Even during moments of slowing down, the film stays right on track and never feels like it has run its course. It engages even when it appears that nothing is happening. The Coen Brothers truly crafted what appears at first glance to be a masterpiece, even if it is their first real shot at something that is not indelibly and inarguably their own. Even without reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I know that the Coens have done it justice, even with their bitterly twisted and dark sense of humour scattered throughout the film.But all of that comes to a standstill as the film concludes. The last twenty or so minutes feel like hours as the film wraps itself up, and it almost feels like these scenes belong to another movie entirely (one that borders on being pretentious and monotonous). I realize now that McCarthy's novel probably ends the same way, but it does not help provide closure to the fact that the movie is so break-neck paced right up until this happens. Its brilliance is shattered by what looks to be a series of tattered events thrown together to provide closure for all of the characters, alive or dead, and for its audience. It speaks volumes to the film's title, but it just does not feel satisfying compared to the rest of what we saw. Even with its enigmatic devices at play, I still cannot come to terms with how the film closes. It does haunt, and in a way, it may prove to be a significantly stronger ending as time rolls on. But as it stands now, it just feels weak.What is also a bit of a surprise, and only seems to appear as the film concludes, is the music. It is not so obvious at first, but the majority of the film is audibly shown with just the sounds the characters make and no background music to speak of. This element is brilliantly used, as it helps intensify every situation and makes the film downright terrifying in some cases. It just helps truly make the film come together, and only helps establish the quick pacing even more so. It was definitely a surprise, and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even stronger.The lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film. Despite the film taking place mainly in deserted areas, or the desert itself, the camera manages to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting is conveying. The isolation and the terror almost become characters themselves through these visuals, and are sure to be recognized as the award season rolls in.The film's acting is also very well done. Brolin anchors the film and even when it is just the audience reacting to his attempts at saving his life, he manages to deliver the best performance of his career. He breathes life into Moss, and truly brings a sense of pathos to the character. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself countlessly. Jones, as the law man stuck on the fringe of every event, also does very well for himself. Most of his work is simply delivering dialogue, but it is delivered in such a fashionable sense that you feel like he is speaking to the bigger picture of things, and not just himself. I would have liked a bit more development in his character, but what little there is helps his performance greatly.Supporting turns from Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are also done well, but are overshadowed by the main cast by both Brolin and Jones.And even more of an overcast is Bardem as the ruthless Chigurh. He absolutely nails this character down to his very bones. If anyone is merely toying with the idea of seeing the film, it should be specifically for Bardem. His performance is calculating and plagued with petrifying silence. When he chooses to talk, his words sound like they are being given by the essence of evil. This is a man with a plan, but it is one that only belongs to him. His enigmatic presence is developed throughout the film, and never once does it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace comes from. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. His terrible hair only helps to make his character that more scary and formidable.No Country for Old Men is one of the best pictures of the year, even if it is flawed. Its brilliance and lasting impact with leave you haunted.8.5/10.",8,601,1002,26 November 2007
District 9," A wildly original tour-de-force that needs to be seen to be believed
","District 9 is perhaps the best science fiction film since The Matrix. Startling words for a little film out of South Africa with a mostly untested cast and crew, but it is doubtful that the phrase will be contested by many.Going in knowing very little is key to the success of this enigmatic masterpiece of contemporary cinema. Blending techniques from the schools of cinéma vérité and avant-garde, District 9 details an alternate history of the world where a spaceship lands in South Africa in the 1980s. Its occupants, some 1-million-plus aliens, are given refugee status and forced to live in a shanty town fenced off from most of the human population.Using government official Wilkus Van De Merwe (first time actor Sharlto Copley) as the central character of the film, District 9 jumps between being a faux documentary loaded with expert interviews, hand-held camera footage and security camera footage, to a gritty, dystopic allegory mixing in elements of Apartheid, big business and even Nazi Germany. But through seamless editing, the major jumps are barely noticeable. While some films find it hard to move from style to style without feeling jarring or blatantly forced, District 9 manages to find a masterful way of movement that feels all too natural (much like Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning Slumdog Millionaire).It is because of this wildly original motif that District 9 stands out as such an amazing piece of film-making. Low budget miracles aside, the film plays out unlike anything you have ever seen. It is truly a unique and original film. Using the relatively untapped documentary style narrative for the majority of the film, the method of storytelling here is so powerful that one wonders why no one else has ever thought to make a film like this before. Doing away with complexities, it is so simple it almost pains me to think that some people just will not get it. In a decade littered with films that ape off of significantly better films or just feel stale altogether, here is a small film that is so wildly off the grid that it practically demands to be seen to be believed.I mention some not being able to grasp the story and ideologies director Neil Blomkamp is putting forth because the film is undeniably and unapologetically anti-Hollywood. There is no flare of contemporary glamour, no big name actors or crew members (outside of producer Peter Jackson), no Transformers-style big budget effects; nothing that screams contemporary American studio-produced cinema. But at the same time, it does not feel like a low budget indie or a foreign produced festival film. It feels like it is one-of-a-kind, a starting point for a breed of experimental film-making. Films like Children of Men, Cloverfield and United 93 have used the stylistic and experimental means of cinéma vérité to their advantages over the past few years and stand out as uniquely made films. But District 9 is the first film in a very long time that really harnesses the medium as an experiment, and succeeds at being so unlike anything that has been released for the entirety of 2009.Being so low budgeted, one would think that the special effects would not be nearly as well done as a film like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen or Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. But rather surprisingly, this film has a sense of epic grandeur that begins with a shot of the alien spacecraft near the opening of the film, and never fades away. So much is done with so little that the story of its production practically begs to be taught in film schools immediately. The aliens, or 'prawns' as they are referred to, are so realistic and lifelike that some shots look even better than those heavily budgeted films. They even have their own language, inexplicably understandable to humans, but so easily used here that it is a great special effect all on its own. Some of the makeup effects are simply astounding for how authentic and terrifying they look. And when the film saunters into being fairly violent, the horrific depictions on-screen are almost too genuine. District 9 is so polished and so seamlessly edited that one wonders why every movie does not look nearly as well done as this one.The acting, as untested and improvised as it is, is strong across the board. Everyone feels natural in their roles, and never once do we question their acting abilities. Copley is the clear standout of the picture, expressing a multitude of emotions every chance he gets. You would never know this is his first role with just how much effort and ease he appears to be giving. I can only hope we will see more of him in the future.The film has too few faults (outside of a few minor plot holes) that it almost feels criminal to mention them. There are a few character motives and perspectives that feel off in the final act of the film. They do not ruin the greatness of the final product, but they do detract from it. And while the film's running time practically soars by, there are more than a few things that seem a little too glossed over. A good movie always leaves you wanting more, but there were a few too many points that went unanswered that easily could have been explained in a piece of dialogue. It is a minor quibble, but nonetheless takes away from the film.Imperfections aside, District 9 is one hell of a ride from start to finish. Some may be turned off by its style, but the film is such a great piece of art that any fan of the medium owes it to themselves to see this film. It is easily one of the best films of the year. Now, do not ruin it with a sequel! 9/10.",9,3,8,16 August 2009
Batman Begins," Not perfect, but one to check out nonetheless
","First off, lemme just say it. Christopher Nolan, you are the man. Schumacher killed Batman (I'll forgive the nipples on the Batsuit, but a flamboyantly gay final film, with Arnold as the main villain?), and you have fixed it for the WB. God bless you.Yes, it was an awesome movie. I won't say that it's one of the better comic book movies as of late, because it seems like a lot of the latest ones (Spider-Man 2, X-2: X-Men United, Hulk, Frank Miller's Sin City) are all very good. But it's one of the better comic books films, and one of the best films of the year.Christian Bale does fantastic work as the Dark Knight. Just fantastic. He's no Michael Keaton though.Overall, the storyline is very good. I was deeply enthralled the entire time. And the atmosphere and mood? Perfect darkness. Yeah, there's a few laughable moments (and one liners, specifically from Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman), but this ain't the flamboyant Batman we saw in Batman and Robin (or should we call it 'Death of a Classic Superhero, Directed by Joel Schumacher'?). This is dark, scary and freaky Batman. And Tim Burton was the only one who did that right.The villains aren't too bad either. I would have liked more out of the Scarecrow, but that's just nitpicking. It was amusing to see the purebred Englishman Tom Wilkenson being a rough Italian New York Mob boss though.And since he deserves his own paragraph, Oldman owns too. I know he's barely in the trailers (if at all), but he's all over the place in the movie. He's actually a very vital sub-character in the film.The back-story is well done too. Liking how the death of his parents, laced with his training, all worked very well. Him getting the goodies was very good as well (especially 'the Tumbler'). And of course, the Bat signal. Katie Holmes as the love interest isn't bad, but isn't anything terribly amazing either.And who could forget the classic.'I'm Batman.' My only real problem starts about halfway through and goes to just before the end. Like it's excellent and all, but it gets kinda goofy in areas with the setups and the way things work out. The lines too, they're all a little cheesy, and kinda misused. It's only in certain instances though, because it doesn't let up in others. As well, it also becomes a tad bit predictable. But what can you expect? It's not like this is the type of psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end.The score was another thing. I enjoyed it, but I miss Elfman's. That was what made Batman to me.Another was the setup for the next villain at the end. I won't ruin who it is if you don't already know, but I will say it's someone who has already been done in the WB films. Like, why can't they just stick with new villains? I know they're re-imagining the entire series, but can't we just hold onto the old films, and maybe say 'Oh, that's Batman when he's older and wiser. This is Batman when's he's young and naive, still learning the ropes.' Wouldn't that make sense, instead of redoing a villain that's already been done? Won't that confuse the hell out of the audience? Oh well.9/10.",9,0,1,7 February 2006
Django Unchained," Brutally hilarious and quite messy, but a total blast from start to finish
","I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino – he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django's editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino's work up until now.But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he's ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie's adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django's shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst. 8/10.",8,673,1057,23 December 2012
The Number 23," An intriguing and thought-provoking idea, but a very disappointing film overall
","I was born on February 23. Right away, you can tell my interest in The Number 23, which just so happened to come out the same day. It did not look particularly good, but it was an intriguing idea and had Jim Carrey, who I have always been a big fan of. Sounded like an alright combination in retrospect, but less than stellar in reality.Walter Sparrow (Carrey) is living a quiet life. He is a dog catcher, and on one fateful day, his birthday of all days, he is called in to grab a dog just before the end of his shift. He fails to get it, and as a result, is late to meet his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen). When he finally gets to her, he finds that she wandered into a book store and began reading a book. Entitled 'The Number 23', she finds in intriguing and buys it for him. Slowly afterwards, the book and its titular number begin to become more than just an obsession for Sparrow.Casually moving back and forth between Sparrow's slow obsession and the characters in the book itself, Fingerling and Fabrizia (Carrey and Madsen again), the film sets out to accomplish a lot. But with on again, off again Joel Schumacher at the helm, someone had to know that the movie was in jeopardy from the moment it started.While Sparrow's story is told rather simplistically, the novel's story is told in all sorts of formats. It tries to be noir in many instances, and tries to be overly stylish in others. Half the time, you are sitting attempting to get involved in the really silly and boringly narrated story (again, by Carrey), and the other half is spent squinting attempting to see what is going on on-screen. The majority of scenes in these sequences are either far too dark or far too bright to make out anything distinguishing. Yes, we can see Carrey, and we can see other characters, but anything else is a real chore. It relies far too much on CGI, and far too little on the set design itself. And it got really annoying seeing some of the camera angles and slick editing techniques done during these scenes. They glared of being overdone and glared even moreso of overcompensating.Overcompensating for what you may ask. And the answer of course, is the story. Yes, it is intriguing, but the end really does not satisfy what the beginning sets out for. It wants to be a psychological thriller, but it does not dare to dig deep within Sparrow's head. It wants to be a guessing game, but it only offers a few guesses before giving away the answers. It reeks of leaching off older films that did similar things, but were done so much more clearly, concisely, and better. Watching this just makes me think Schumacher had no idea how he wanted his picture to end, or even how he wanted the middle to be. Fernley Phillips was only a first time screenwriter during the production phase, so his cuts and edits would have more than been legit. But of course, he failed to act, and therefore has set himself up a simple twisty thriller that could have been a lot more complicated.What is the real core of the movie, and what will essentially be why it was ever popular at all, is the titular number. I spent countless minutes before, during and after watching the movie trying to find combinations of numbers that would equal out to 23, or just already pre-existing numbers to see if I could find it. I did more than a few times, but it more than frightened me when I actually did. I felt the fear, and the desperation of wanting to be rid of it. But of course, I am stuck with it, and even now I am questioning where I can find other 23's. In that respect, the film delivers high in its thought-provoking nature, and even higher in the fact that you do not need to see the movie in order to become obsessed with the number and idea of the film.Carrey does not seem totally at ease in his part. Yes, he pulls out the stops and has pitch perfect emotions, but he looks bored. He has the scheming look on his face of 'There really was nothing better?' for about ninety per cent of the film, and the other ten per cent is at random crazy or happy intervals. He just lacks the spark needed to really make the film zesty, and unfortunately, having to hold up the film on his shoulders, Carrey fails.Madsen is not all too bad as the wife stuck in the middle of the broken down husband. She plays the role convincingly, but it really does not look like there was much more for her to do than what she does do. If her part was written with a lot more action, than she may have been able to help life Carrey's performance, and actually made it worthwhile to have do. Danny Huston does fairly well for himself on the other hand. He is deliciously evil in one scene, and very subtle in one scene. You know from the start that something is up with his character, and Huston does a great job in ensuring that the audience never quite places what. Unfortunately, the script does not say much of his greater aspirations for the film, and as a result, only contributes to its disappointing finale.On the whole, the film is disappointing and not all that great. But for the sheer idea of becoming obsessed with a number more unlucky than that historical number 13, it is a worthwhile and decent watch. Just do not expect anything more than average at best.6.5/10.",6,2,5,24 February 2007
Ghost Rider," Alright, but has many problems, especially with its humour
","Despite knowing very little other than the basic mythos, I was still rather hyped to see Ghost Rider. I was disappointed at first at the fact that its release date was pushed back from last summer until now, but figured there was a good reason for it. Unfortunately after seeing it, I think they should have held it off even longer.As a child, Johnny Blaze does death-defying stunts on a motorbike alongside his father. When he receives word of his father having cancer, he makes a deal with the devil, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda), to save his father's life. In exchange, he signs over his soul to him to do a job that will not be required until much later in life. Zap forward at least fifteen years, and Blaze (Nicolas Cage) is doing positively insane bike stunts and thrilling crowds all over the United States. At the same time, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) has arrived back on earth, looking for a long lost contract of souls. Only then is Johnny contacted by the devil again to stop him, and becomes the title character.The movie itself is not all that bad. The storyline is pretty good, and stays consistent throughout despite the addition of a few subplots. Everything just practically flies by.But that is what hurts the film a lot too.The origin of Johnny Blaze is done very well, and quite speedily. He is introduced, signs the deal, and is an adult faster than you can say the devil's name. But after that, when it should begin to meander and slow down a bit, it just keeps up the pace and does not stop. Characters introduced part way through and should get more of a chance to do things are just held back, and random moments go on for longer than they should. It feels imbalanced in some sections, and feels undercooked in others. Battle scenes are especially hit, as they last varyingly between a few seconds and a few minutes. If you blink during some of them, you may miss them.Which leads us to the next issue: it is too damn cheesy. I understand that comics are very tongue-in-cheek and heavily ironic/predictable. But the movie versions usually have some form of seriousness to them. Here, it is almost all laughable moments, and no sheer moments of seriousness. Just listening to Ghost Rider is like listening to a cheap comedian. A cheap comedian who looks bad ass of course. Lines like 'You're pissing me off,' and 'Guilty,' are just too funny for words. But they should not be. This comic book story is dark and morbid in its content, so why is that not reflected in the film? A lot less cheese and a lot more seriousness would have gone a long way.The special effects are another iffy area. Ghost Rider himself looks great the majority of the time. His flaming skull head looks natural, and never looks pasted on in any instant. When he jumps on his bike and starts riding is when he looks particularly good, as it is evident that the filmmakers spent extra attention on getting these two details down pat, even during moments of fighting or driving. Clumsily however, when Blaze first transforms into the vigilante superhero, the effects look really terrible and really cheaply done. They still look decent, but in comparison to the easy transformations later on, they stand out as fairly bad.The scene involving Ghost Rider and the helicopter has some of the worst effects I have seen in a recent film (although nowhere near as horrendous as the shoddily produced The Brothers Grimm). The deaths that Blackheart is responsible for look okay, but looks the last one he does looks rather obnoxiously edited in. When he and his cronies show off their powers, it looks a hell of a lot better, but nowhere near as powerfully and majestically created as Ghost Rider's.Cage is alright as Blaze. He is very laid back, and acts up at the appropriate times. I think he tried a little too hard to be seen as being younger though, but he does manage to pull it off. His lack of melodramatics (like in the recent World Trade Center) also helps, as he stays grounded in the role, and does not make it out to be a complete joke. When he is Ghost Rider though, as said, it just does not totally work. Fonda and Sam Elliot who shows up off and on, are both on about the same page of being alright. They do an admirable job, but they just do not make the roles anything more than they already are. Bentley on the other hand, really does a good job as Blackheart. He plays him up and is great in this villainous role. If he was handed better dialogue, and had a few more scenes, he would have really become a force to be reckoned with.Eva Mendes however, is very haphazard as Blaze's love interest Roxanne. She does nothing for the movie except for bringing an added hotness to it. Her dialogue exchanges with Cage are alright, but their chemistry is not all that great. She does not seem like she is all in it like the rest of the cast, and just feels like the weakest link (albeit a hell of a lot stronger than Ms. Katie 'Useless' Holmes in Batman Begins). And despite how gorgeous she is, it really is awkward seeing every shirt (and dress) she wears undone right down to the exact same button, revealing the same amount of cleavage in every single scene.On the whole, the film is just alright and nothing else. It could have used a lot more work than it got in that short period between last summer and now. As it stands, it just does not hold a candle to some of the better comic book films.7/10.",7,1,2,22 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," A solid effort that has a few shortcomings
","Growing up, I was an oft comic book fan. I read a few, but I paid more attention to the TV series of the 1990's, which from what I've seen, heard and read since, followed the comics much closer than any movie could. So with great anticipation, I watched the first X-Men film back in 2000, and was fairly disappointed. Yes, it set up the foundations for everything else to come, but it just did not feel right to me. When X2: X-Men United came out, I was fairly stoked, but was ready to be disappointed again. Luckily, I was not. The film was excellent in all phases of the word, and stands as one of my favourite comic book adaptations.But then, Bryan Singer left the production of the inevitable X3 and Brett Ratner stepped in. I can't say I was immediately impressed, but I was still very hyped to see it. After seeing the film, I can say that I was happy that it was not completely mangled from what Singer delivered in the first two films, but it still does manage to deviate a bit from what I can only imagine was the original vision for the film.So there really is not a whole lot to say about the movie that most people do not already know about. A drug has been discovered that will help 'cure' mutants of their powers, and let them be completely human. Of course, there are some who embrace this idea quickly, but many do not. Leading the charge is Magneto (Ian McKellan), whose ideals for mutants and humans have always clashed with that of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). So as this whole 'cure' business begins to come together, many begin questioning their ideals about being mutants, and in a sense, take a stand (an obvious nod to the subtitle of the film) and choose how they will continue to lead their lives.All of the core performances, no matter how big or small they are, are all well done. I was a little worried about how Kelsey Grammar would handle Beast, but he puts all worries to rest. Hugh Jackman continues his perfection of playing Wolverine, while Halle Berry is given so much more to do as Storm, that you begin to understand that she may not just be total eye candy (although she still does not prove to me that she deserves an Oscar). Stewart and McKellan continue their great performances, and returnees like Shawn Ashmore, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn, Aaron Stanford, James Marsdan, Daniel Cudmore and Famke Janssen are all completely at home with their roles, and continue playing them gracefully. Newbies like Ben Foster as Angel, Ellen Page as Kitty Pride and Cameron Bright as Leech among others were questionable choices and additions to the cast, but unfortunately, are given very little screen time and real character developing moments to be anywhere near comparable to all the returning actors. Vinnie Jones is sadly underused as Juggernaut, but his few moments are memorable and show off his talent greatly. Cameos from Stan Lee and R. Lee Ermey are also quite memorable.The story on the other hand, is iffy. It seems like the filmmakers really wanted to cram a lot into this movie, but still use many of the characters we know and love. So unfortunately, some come and go, and some unfortunately get very little screen time at all. And while the film completely changes some of the key story lines (like Dark Phoenix), it tries to continue the momentum of Singer's pictures, and not allow it to completely halt any of the continued ones that were in the first two films. While some changes are downright upsetting, others are handled very well and are easily acceptable. While Ratner may have directed it, you can still feel the heavy influence from Singer. For that reason, he does not completely mangle everything the films had going for them. He does add a lot more comedy, a lot more sex, and a lot more emotion, but he makes a solid attempt to stay close to what Singer had. While he does not handle the emotional scenes the same way Singer does, his valiant effort is not unnoticeable.Ratner's main change from Singer was the amping up of the mutant powers, effectively upping the number of special effects within the film. And they are all a marvel to see. While being much more low key in the original films, they are very much present and being showcased here. All of the shots are well done, and look extremely realistic, even when we know what is happening is downright absurd. From Storm's weather changing, to Iceman's ice, to even Wolverine's quick healing, all are captured excellently, and help really bring to life the powers these people have. Beast's complete agility and fierce fighting are also great to see finally brought to screen after so long.While Ratner made a solid effort to not completely destroy the X-Men series, I can't help but say that some of what ends up happening in this vastly shorter film, is a bit of a disappointment. What built into something excellent, ends on just a great note. Ratner lets it falter a bit, but his handling of the rest of the film is valiant and a compliment to Singer. I just cannot help but wonder what could have been done if Superman Returns had not finally been green-lit. It's a worthwhile close to the franchise (at least for now), and is very entertaining, but do not expect it to hold a candle to the second film.8/10.",8,1,3,26 May 2006
I Am Legend," A half baked story ruins the film's chances of being legendary
","In a few years time, a cure for cancer has been discovered. It works perfectly at first, but then a virus emerges that begins to wipe out the human population. Fast forward a few years later, and scientist Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the only living human in New York City. Along with his dog Sam, he searches and prays to encounter other survivors. But while day time presents only the challenge of outgunning wild animals, the nights bring mutant zombies just trying to stay fed.I never saw The Omega Man or The Last Man on Earth, but I am very curious if they were anywhere near as disheartening as this film. I did not go in with the highest of expectations, but after sitting through at least an hour of this movie, I began to actually think I was going to leave surprised in how great it was. Sadly, that did not end up being the case.The story, as unoriginal as it sounds, starts off intriguing and genuinely nerve-wracking. We see Neville and his dog going about their day-to-day routines, and we begin to realize the loneliness and terror that he is going through. He nostalgically watches old news programs from before the virus hit, keeps pictures of his family laying around the house, and frequently dreams about the last night he saw his family. These moments provide just the right amount of pathos needed to feel for this character, and as an audience, we grow dependant on wondering if he will achieve his dream of interaction and end the frightening isolation he faces. Much the same as Tom Hanks in Cast Away, we learn to appreciate what is basically one character interacting with another who cannot speak back.But this is about all we get from his character by way of development. He spends much of the film searching for a cure for the epidemic, and we learn early on that it was his job to do so before the population was wiped out. But never once are we told why it was him chosen, or even how the epidemic started in the first place. We see articles and cut-outs littered around apartments, but never once does Neville stop and mention anything. Even worse, why is he the only one left? Just what exactly happened to everyone else? Unfortunately, obvious questions like these (and many, not so subtle others) are never answered. One can possibly leave it to the imagination, but with as perplexing an idea as this film presents, you would assume that the filmmakers would try and cover every angle of personality of this character. Instead, he is a few steps above being a one-dimensional card board cut out. The last third of the film does not help much either.There are also a few annoying gaps of logic in reference to the zombie characters. Besides appearing at night, emitting horrible howls at any given moment and running like Olympic marathoners, none of them are given much else to do as characters. We are introduced early on to what one would assume is the leader (played by Dash Mihok), but never get a sense of why he leads. We just get terrifying yelps and near horrifying visuals. It does not help either that the makeup and special effects used for these creatures seems like they were just thrown together, instead of being molded into perfection.Smith, as the lead and only real intelligible character for the majority of the movie, is a mixed bag. This is not his best performance, but it is not nearly his worst either. He seems to be throwing his whole heart into the role, but its demand just does not seem to be wearing off on him. Even though we are meant to believe that he is slowly going crazy from a lack of social interaction, Smith never truly shows this trait. He pokes and nudges at it, but there is something off in his calculations. Hell, his most emotionally packed sequences are almost laughable compared to some of the material in last year's The Pursuit of Happiness (and that movie was only watchable because of him). His dedication to the role wears off far too easy, and never do we get even a remotely close attempt at emulating the brilliant performance Hanks made on that island years ago. Smith is good, but just not good enough.What the film loses out on in the story and in Smith, is completely different with the visuals. They are simply awestriking. Looking at the ravaged New York, it is almost too scary to think of it ever looking anything as dystopic and plant-friendly as this. These sets were created with precision and care. While the zombies look a little haphazard, these backgrounds are just stunning. Even his apartment, where much of the film takes place, looks simply amazing. There is nothing simplistic about them, and they end up working great for the film. The colours conveyed throughout the film are also very interesting, and are well captured by the camera.The special effects on the other hand, are a little shifty. The monsters do not look that great, but some of the animals look photorealistic, and some of the sequencing (including a nighttime scene on a dock) are very well thought-out and put together. It is visually pleasing, and when they are actually on, the graphics look astounding.Plagued with problems, I Am Legend could have probably done with a solid rewrite to pack in a few more answers. Leaving it to the audience's own devices is simply uncalled for. I realize they wanted something fast paced, and the film delivers on that ideal for the most part, but only because it sacrifices too much of the all important story. More work here would have only made the film stronger, and Smith's performance potentially legendary.6/10.",6,14,33,14 December 2007
Kick-Ass," A riotously hilarious blood-soaked film that lives up to its namesake from start to finish
","Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) is bored at school, bored with life. He is not quite a loser, but he is by no means popular either. He enjoys reading comics, and decides one day it may be a good idea to become a superhero and fight crime himself. After a rather messy mishap, he is soon caught on camera helping someone getting beat up, and becomes an internet sensation. And then he starts to meet other people wearing masks.Much like the comic/graphic novel it is based on, Kick-Ass is exactly that. It is a riotously enjoyable time from start to finish. I had originally thought Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman would run into more than their share of problems trying to adapt one of the most ridiculously violent comics in recent memory. But the independent funding and creation of the film seems to have worked in their favour, because the film has a go-for-broke style unlike most mainstream films.While I imagined it would be worse, Kick-Ass is an incredibly brutal and often disgustingly violent picture. People are chopped up, crushed, beaten, or shot, and the film revels in how red the screen quickly becomes. It does nowhere near equal the same insane amount of blood shed in the comics, but it does more than a worthwhile job attempting to come close. Some of the unique and creative angles and designs for some of the deaths are simply awesome all on their own. I am not overly squeamish, but the film is not for the weak of heart. This is a very hard R-rated film, and one that surprised me by how much made it through the censors.Unlike Robert Rodriguez and Zack Snyder before him, Vaughn has crafted a film that loosely follows the Kick-Ass series, but takes its own turns. I re-read the comics before seeing the film just as a refresher, and I found myself riveted at just the right intervals, whether they were originally in the books or the film's own deviation. A lot of the material and moments in the film feel just right, and help amplify the plot in some areas, and simplify it in others. I particularly enjoyed that they kept with the zany, Quentin Tarantino-style profanity-laden dialogue, and kept all the references to other comics. It would have been easy for Vaughn and Goldman just to re-create the comics, but making it their own without much sacrifice makes it feel and come off almost as great as the trailers do.If there is anything I do hold against their changes, it is the fact that some of the mean-spiritedness of the original story is missing here. Some of the changes, specifically with the character of Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca) and to a point, the origins of Hit Girl (Chloë Grace Moretz) and Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage), lack the power and the message found in the original works by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. The book was a dark mess of humour, satire and gruesome violence. But it was deadly serious in many areas. The film on the other hand, when it is not falling into second act ill paced melodrama (not necessarily bad, but not well paced either), never once takes itself serious. It just wants to be fun, and it wants to entertain the audience. A good chunk of the film's ending feels like it belongs in a comic book more than the material in the books themselves. I can respect this, but the two integral pieces of the original story I mentioned, seem like they should have been recreated here. I am all for the majority of changes made, but that vast majority kept with the integrity and style of the original work. Taking stuff like those mentioned out, seems like a disservice to the audience.Acting wise, everyone does a terrific job in their roles. Cage, almost unrecognizable, delivers a subtle and bizarre performance as Big Daddy. I figured he would ham it up for the majority of the film, and while he does, he manages to come off as a heartfelt and interesting character. This is not the typical off-the-rails performance Cage is usually known and loved for, but his strange twist on the fairly one-dimensional character is reason enough to see the film. Mark Strong is great as mob boss and primary villain Frank D'Amico, and rather surprisingly, Christopher Mintz-Plasse brings a life and energy to Chris D'Amico/Red Mist that I never knew he had. Yes, there are times when he is channeling McLovin, but he makes Chris the character he needs to be.The relatively unknown Johnson is a marvel as both Dave and Kick-Ass. His juggling act of trying to make something of himself while fighting with teenage angst is something we can all identify with, and is what makes the character so endearing in the first place. To see him brought to life so well and so realistically is simply magnificent. We feel his pain at every turn, and we understand all too well what his problems are. He is the real approximation of what it would be like for any one of us to act like Batman, and Johnson never once stops being that character. But unfortunately, the film really belongs to Moretz. She alternates at random between cute and cuddly Mindy Macready and the violently vicious assassin Hit Girl like a seasoned professional. She steals the show every chance she gets, and for good reason. Her dialogue, her actions, everything about her is amazing, and a testament to how incredible this young actor is now, and will quickly become.If you can stand the violence, Kick-Ass is an incredibly enjoyable time at the movies. What it lacks in seriousness, it more than makes up for in fun and humour. It is unlike any comic book movie you have seen, and likely, ever will see.8.5/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",8,8,23,16 April 2010
Shrek the Third," The animation is great, but the rest just feels like a missed opportunity
","Despite its heavy amount of popularity, I was never that much a fan of the original Shrek. It had laughs, and a great story, but it just did not completely jive for me. Something was missing, and I was left devoid of any of the enjoyment everyone else got from it. Years passed, and after Shrek 2's release, I actually was impressed. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and felt it more than made up for the shortcomings of the original. So with Shrek the Third, I obviously had some hopes that it would at least attempt to live up to the second film. Unfortunately, no such luck.While the trailers have basically gave the entirety of the plot away, I will give the briefest of explanations. The king has perished, and the heir needs to take the throne. Shrek (Mike Myers) is obviously not fitting of the job, so he takes Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) on a quest to find the second-in-line, Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) cousin, Artie (Justin Timberlake). Meanwhile, Fiona and her friends are stuck in Far, Far Away as Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) is assembling a group that will help him become king.What one notices straight off the bat is that the film is a whole lot more mature than the others. There is very little to goof around about, as the majority of the film is very plot and dialogue driven, unlike the other light-hearted films in the series. Not to say that this film does not have its share of the silly wit that made the other two films popular, but it just feels like it was not of the utmost importance here. This one, dare I say it, is extremely serious about what it wants to accomplish, and it tries its best to stay on that course from beginning to end. You can tell in certain scenes that this way is working, but in others, it just looks awkward.As well, the overall darkness and adult humour is almost through the roof with this film. Very little, if any of the jokes that do not involve farting, pooping or being smelly, are directed at children. The rest are totally thrown right at the adults, and it is practically sink or swim with most of them. And even the best of jokes do not work, because unfortunately, they are not all that funny. There are a few drop dead hilarious moments littered throughout the film, but the majority may just raise a smirk if anything at all. The earlier films had very clever references to adult-style humour, and they were very well disguised. Here, they are out in the open almost blatantly, and they have just lost any of the cleverness they could have had if they were hidden. They look, and they feel like the filmmakers did not want to put too much effort in, and instead just wanted to gun it towards another record breaking animated film.The story is another problem. It stays consistent in the directions it takes, but all of them lack the strength to motivate the audience to keep watching. The whole Artie being a social outcast seemed a bit too forced, and just to clichéd and obvious. The Prince Charming scheme starts off intriguingly, but as it keeps moving along, it just begins to flop (maybe because they realized halfway through that far too much of the plot seemed to revolve around him, and more needed to be said for Shrek and friends?). The filmmakers were clearly going for a more mature tone, but then why not make the story truly excel and not just feel like it was written by a second-rate has-been? But for all of its problems, the animation takes over and shows just how excellent it can be. If you thought that Shrek 2 had plenty of minute details, be prepared to see even more here. In a lot of cases, the characters look almost human in design, and would only look out of place because of how bright their clothing is. Their look has just been perfected to what I imagine is an all-time high, just waiting to be topped with totally realistic looking humans. When you have characters who get minor close-ups, and you can see just how much stubble is growing by the minute, can you really have anything less? It is a pleasure to watch, and was amusing to pick out some of the extras the animators threw in.The voice work is a bit here and there. Myers feels very held back, and does not seem to have the same amount of enthusiasm that he did in the first two films. He was having fun then. Now, he is just doing it because he has to. Same goes for Murphy, who while being ecstatic at all times, just does not stay on par for the entirety of the film. Diaz is sadly underused, and Timberlake is far too overused. I understood the need for it, but it just got annoying after awhile.Banderas on the other hand, is a standout for how much heart there is in his performance. Sadly, he is not used as much here as he was in the predecessor, but he does a great job anyway. Everett is on fire until the finale. I absolutely loved every moment he was on-screen, and I just wish they would have rewritten the entire end sequence. It only half flows as it is. Supporting talent from the likes of Julie Andrews to Larry King are all used very abundantly, and offer plenty of laughs and giggles.Sadly, Shrek the Third is only mildly watchable. The maturity of the film will turn children right off, but it still does not account for how obnoxiously botched an opportunity this was to make an even better sequel.6/10.",6,3,8,19 May 2007
The Hurt Locker," A refreshingly thrilling and exhilarating experience from start to finish
","While some movies are immediately forgotten moments after watching them, I can still remember the feeling during and after seeing The Hurt Locker four months later. It is being hailed now as one of the best films of the year, and it deserves every accolade it is given. The film follows a bomb defusing unit in Iraq, lead by the adrenaline junkie and borderline-insane Staff Sergeant William James (Jeremy Renner) and including Sergeant JT. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty), and their trials and tribulations during their tour of duty.While films about or involving the Iraq war are a hard sell, and make for rather pitiful films, The Hurt Locker is something of an anomaly. It deals with the war head-on, and manages to be a riveting thriller from start to finish. This is the most realistic and disturbing film to come out of this conflict thus far, and it shows in how well made it is. It borders on feeling like a documentary on the real men and women in bomb squad units in more than a few instances. It knows exactly what beats to strike, what buttons to push and what emotional chords need to be yanked at. It is a hard film to swallow, and never winces even at the most intense of times. It merely packs on more hard-edged realism.Kathryn Bigelow is not necessarily the first director you would imagine taking on such a heavy topic as this in a film (her previous films include K-19: The Widowmaker, Strange Days, and the much beloved action film, Point Break), but she proves to be the most capable filmmaker to have attacked it thus far. Her interpretation of one of the most controversial moments and ideas of the decade is one that is unlike anything you could even attempt to imagine. She captures the terror and horror of war so well that she seems more than well versed in the subject. Her research and passion for the project is more than simply evident from moment one.The editing of the film is what really makes the film as powerful as it is. Music is used very sparingly scene to scene. Moments of silence are compounded by the ticking of bombs, and the clipping of pliers. We hear the unit's every breath, and feel their sweat. We are in the desert with them, feeling their every move and thought as they have them. Their fear and caution are downright terrifying, because we as an audience are so heavily invested in what happens to this small team. We do not want to see anything bad happen to them, but as the film shows us on multiple occasions, no one is safe from injury or death on the battlefield.What also helps the film is the relatively unknown cast. The three principal actors are recognizable supporting characters from many films and TV series' over the past decade, but none have them have really carried a film like they do here. Because we are not watching the likes of a Brad Pitt or a Will Smith, our investment and believability in these actors is heightened. How are we able to distinguish between an actor inhabiting a role of a soldier in combat, and an actual soldier in combat, when each of these actors just seem so immersed and buried within their roles? They each have their own arch in the film, and each manages to breathe a life into their characters that no other actor has been able to do thus far.Renner is the particular standout of the bunch because he is both the lead, and the character with the most emphasis placed on him. He carries the film, and makes you genuinely believe in it. All of the heartbreak, the sorrow, and the triumph this character faces, Renner makes feel unparallelled. He is not exactly method acting like Marlon Brando would, but he looks like he is coming close to it. He is just that well versed and professional in this role. And only compliments his two supporting cast members.Interesting small roles from Guy Pearce, David Morse and Voldemort himself, Ralph Fiennes, are all handed well. Each brings a unique piece to the film that gives it more depth, and allows the audience to wrap onto someone they may recognize a bit better. These critically acclaimed character actors almost act like they are passing the torch on to the younger actors, to give them a chance to really make something of their film careers as they move onto their next generation of acting roles.If the film falters at all, it is in a humanizing subplot between Renner's character James and a young Iraqi boy nicknamed Beckham (Christopher Sayegh). It is meant to show that James is not a total whack job who spends his day knocking on death's door, but there are more than enough scenes and exchanges between the principal actors that these scenes are unneeded. Yes, the subplot does give us one of the most truly horrific and emotional scenes in the entire film, but this scene is not enough to make up for how dragged out the film becomes with the addition of the subplot. It easily could have worked much the same way without it, even if it does help break up how monotonous the bomb defusing becomes at times (as realistic and pulse pounding as it is).The Hurt Locker is the best film about the Iraq war currently, and is just a great war film in general. Not only that, it is also one of the best films of the year. It is a thrilling and exhilarating experience from start to finish that may be a test of endurance for more than a few people. But that experience is more than just rewarding.8.5/10.",8,5,11,17 December 2009
The Illusionist," A gorgeous looking film with magnificent performances from Norton and Giamatti
","I had only heard of it as being a film from Sundance, but after some positive word of mouth got around, The Illusionist started making its way around theatres. It found its way to a theatre near me, and having seen everything else that was actually worth seeing, I gave it a shot. While it is not perfect at all, I still was fairly impressed by it.Set in Vienna circa 1900s, Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) has arrested Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a local magician who practically rakes in the cash from everyone in Vienna coming out to see him. As it turns out, Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) is not to impressed with him for a number of reasons, not withstanding his love for Leopold's fiancée Sophie (Jessica Biel). After the arrest, Uhl spends the rest of the film telling Leopold the story of Eisenheim and how he managed to find himself in the predicament the film starts him out in.The description may sound interesting, but the way the film plays out is not. Nothing exciting or particularly thrilling really happens at all within the storyline, and unfortunately, once it starts getting going, it becomes a little bit too predictable. Do not fret though, besides ending on a note similar to a critically acclaimed 1990's film, the film still holds a few surprises for the viewer. I understand that it was adapted from a short story and made a whole lot longer, but the film could have really used a whole lot of extra padding. It is not that the film is boring, it just does not really make itself out to be an attention grabber.Of course, this is all that can be found 'wrong' with the film, as everything else is excellent.The film itself looks like a piece of art. The art direction and cinematography really allow this film to believably recreate the early 1900s, and it looks gorgeous. You can almost see the fine brush strokes. It really plays off on the atmosphere of the film at the time, and deviates accordingly. When the film is happy for its short time, the colours are warm and bright. When the film gets dark and moody, the colours become drab and shadow-like. Scenes in the darkened theatres are of particular interest, as are some of the outdoors scenes. The childhood flashback scenes, with the watered down colours and scratchy picture quality really impressed me, and really stood out in the film. Continually doing transitions with the circle wipes either closing or opening up the image got annoying very fast though. The score and special effects used to showcase Eisenheim's illusions are also quite majestic and well done as well.The acting, even with the iffy accents and bizarre facial hair, is very well done from the three chief male players. Norton continues with being a great performer, and while it is not as strong as his work in the likes of American History X, Fight Club or The 25th Hour (which I have yet to watch in its entirety), it is still very strong. There are a few moments within the film where he is just gazing right into the camera, and doing nothing else. While some actors may completely ruin scenes like these, Norton relishes in it. His expression, his body language and demeanor, everything about him is perfect. All you can think about is how strong of an enigmatic presence he has on screen, and how his performing skills have yet to wither.While his choice of work is not always great, Sewell plays his role of the conniving Leopold quite well. Not as strong as Norton, but much better than Biel, who ends up not only being useless eye candy, but useless altogether. She has little to no chemistry with anyone on the screen (least of all Norton), and just feels like a totally wasted character (even though she is so important to the story). A better choice of actress could have only helped this performance actually be worth anything in the grand scheme of things.But of course, I must contend that the standout performance is from Giamatti. The recent Oscar nominee practically chews a hole right through the scenery and the screen as Uhl. We are never too sure whose side he is playing on, and Giamatti has just enough charisma and energy to pull this supporting role off magnificently. He steals every scene away from everyone on screen (including Norton), to the point that his smoldering presence on screen is enough for the price of admission alone. This role yet again proves why he is one of the hardest working and best character actors in the business, and shows that he is not a one-trick pony at all.In the end, the film is worth it for the great way the film looks and the excellent performances from Norton and Giamatti. Go to see those things, and you will not come away disappointed.8/10.",8,0,0,5 September 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Has its problems, but does a much better job than the first film
","I was never a big fan of the first Fantastic Four movie. Despite my limited knowledge of the mythos of that comic franchise, I could still tell how sloppily made the film was. It had a few good areas, but not enough to make it pass being merely watchable. After watching it, I held hopes for the obvious sequel, and whether or not it would be able to truly make the franchise fall in line with other superhero films. But while Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer does improve a few of the errors of the first film, it still is plagued with a lot of the same problems.Picking up some time after the events of the first film, the sequel finds the team still trying to wrestle between leading their lives, and the media circus that follows their every move (even down to the point where Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm/Invincible Woman's (Jessica Alba) wedding is the celebrity event of the year). But when a strange force begins to cause unnatural phenomena, as well as bizarrely gigantic pot holes around the world, the team is thrust into trying to stop it before it does any devastating harm to the planet.While the origin story in the first film was quite sketchy and dare I say stretched a bit too far in the literal and emotional senses, this second story is a bit of a mixed bag. It is definitely a lot more concrete and straight-forward, but there are plenty of moments where I sat wondering why it was being so jumpy with what was going on. The opening seconds of the film even has a bit of an integral plot device going on. It was surprising and a bit jarring, and became even more so when I realized just how quickly it ended. There was plenty of exposition, but there was just something missing from the overall storyline with it being so short and fast-paced.What also did not help was the juggling act the film did with its themes and its tones. At the drop of a hat, it jumped from slapstick comedy to a drama, to just bizarre science fiction. I know that the comics were known for their humour, but much like the first movie, a little bit of it feels a little ill placed. I did indeed get plenty of laughs from the odd pairing of Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm/The Thing (Michael Chiklis), but much of the other humour seemed a little weary and flat in some cases. The shaky tone of the film probably did not help this (as even the music became quite whimsical when even confronting what should be an intense action sequence). The themes were also a bit of an issue, as they did not stay as straight and narrow as anyone could have hoped. They too jumped around, focusing a little too much in some places that did not matter as much as the places they did not focus on.The special effects on the other hand, have greatly improved since the last go around. No longer does Mr. Fantastic look completely computer generated. He actually looks like a living entity this time (even during his hokey dance sequence which was nowhere near as effective as the one in Spider-Man 3), and actually moves a lot more gracefully. Same goes for the Human Torch and the Invincible Woman, whose powers now look a lot more life-like, and a lot more natural than they did before. The star of the show, the Silver Surfer (acted by the impeccable Doug Jones and voiced by Lawrence Fishbourne), may not get a lot of real backstory, but he looks absolutely amazing. It is immensely hard to even realize that the character is not totally computer animated, and in fact, looks even more realistic than the powers the superheroes are wielding. Kudos to the filmmakers for putting some extra money into one of the key areas that needed help (although I think Galactus probably could have done with an extra touch of work).Sadly, two years has done nothing for Gruffudd and Alba. They still do not work well as their characters, and they work even less as a believable couple. A key plot element within the film is about their wedding that keeps getting postponed. But when you see these two interacting with each other, you will be hard set even trying to imagine how they co-exist. There is not even an ounce of chemistry between them, and the film suffers as a result of it. Gruffudd is just too lifeless in his role as Mr. Fantastic, and Alba is too classless for Invincible Woman. She plays the character more like a narcissist waiting for the right moment to run to the bathroom to throw on some more makeup than she does as a strong willed scientist who just happens to be a superhero.Evans on the other hand, is pitch perfect as Human Torch. He has the egotistical mannerisms down solid, and is just enough of a wise ass to truly feel authentically created by the comics. Chiklis is a lot stronger this time round, but is sadly, the most underused of the four. I would have liked a little more sinister villainy from Julian McMahon, who returns as Dr. Doom and has a lot more screen time than I ever would have imagined. A little more dialogue from Fishbourne would not have been a bad idea either.On the whole, the sequel does a better job than the original, and seems to be headed into the right direction if they make a third film. While it does have a lot of the same problems as the first movie, it does an adequate job making up for a lot of them. I just wish everyone in the main cast was as perfect as Evans.6.5/10.",6,2,5,7 July 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Spectacular makeup effects do not make up for a densely boring narrative
","David Fincher, as brilliant and astonishing a filmmaker as he is, is a meticulous perfectionist. Some films show this off for the better (Fight Club, Se7en and The Game), while others falter and are weakened by it (Zodiac and Panic Room). So it should have surprised no one when the buzz came in over all the problems associated with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. And unsurprisingly, this film also suffers from that perfectionist stroke.Benjamin (played prominently by Brad Pitt) is born just after World War I with a rare disease that makes him age backwards; appearing older when he is young, and younger when he gets older. He is left on the porch of an elderly home as a baby, and is almost carelessly discarded for how hideous he looks. But one of the staff members, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) takes him in and raises him as her own. Gradually as Benjamin ages, he grows younger and can begin to do more. But he is seen differently by everyone who meets him, leading him down various journeys and paths.Fincher has crafted his second epic (the first being the slow-burn crime drama Zodiac), and has stumbled on the same mistakes he did the first time. He starts off with a great opening and first act, packed with the minutest of details that I doubt anyone could spot everything he is conveying in one sitting. But as the film takes off into its second and third acts, it becomes inundated with too many details and too few interesting moments. The film is a mere fourteen minutes longer than The Dark Knight, but it feels like an eternity longer. As it trucks along, Benjamin Button just slowly becomes more boring when it should become more interesting. What should be focused more heavily on is not, and what is, should not be. It feels like Fincher is trying to up himself over and over again, while still pleasing everyone else. He used to know when to say cut, but here, he seems to have totally lost himself in trying to build an epic that did not need to be as lengthy as it is.A key reason for this is because of a love story between Benjamin and Daisy (played prominently by Cate Blanchett). He meets her as a young boy (although he looks like a senior nearing death), and falls in love. The love story between the two seems cute and sweet at first (despite being a touch creepy because of Benjamin's initial appearance versus Daisy's), but slowly becomes melodramatic and overbearing. Yes, the character of Daisy is integral to the story, but by the end, she seems to be a nuisance. An epic is not an epic because of an eternity spanning love story. It is the storytelling method that makes an epic, and unfortunately, hinging it on something like this is a bit amateur. Surely Fincher could have helped fixed up Eric Roth's screenplay to be a lot stronger?What also does not help is the chemistry between Pitt and Blanchett is not all there. Yes, they work off each other well, but for long lost lovers to become connected after so many years, they do not do a convincing enough job. The chemistry practically emanates between Pitt and relative newcomer Madisen Beaty, who plays a teenaged version of Daisy. How can Pitt make a relationship more convincing with someone who is so much younger, than someone he has actually worked with in the past? Sure, we can chalk it up to the CGI wizardry being used at that point in the film, versus later on, but surely Pitt can act better as himself than as a special effect?Pitt carries the film fairly well, but is not particularly well suited for the role. He does well as the younger Benjamin, exploring and learning about life, but as the wiser and older Benjamin, he seems to waver. Like the film, he is great in the first half, and slowly falls apart as the film goes on. Blanchett has done much stronger work than this, and is surprisingly tame in her performance. It is actually the supporting cast that does a great job. Henson is astonishing in her nurturing mother role, bringing just the right amount of humanity and zest to a character that could have easily been phoned in as a stereotype. Jared Harris does excellent work as Captain Mike, and Jason Flemyng is great as Benjamin's dad Thomas. But the real reason anyone should even attempt to sit through this mess of an ambitious film are the spectacular special effects. Making Brad Pitt look like a feeble old man who looks nothing like the actor is clearly not an easy thing to do. But every scene, whether it is actually the man himself caked behind enormous amounts of makeup (whether to make him look ancient or to look like the golden boy we first remember him as back in the early 1990s), or he is digitally placed in there, looks just as realistic as the next. You will believe that Pitt is really that age. The effects are just that believable. I was simply stunned watching him on-screen, interacting with other people. It is almost terrifying to think how far we have come that something like this could look as realistic as it does (likewise to Blanchett, who spends a good portion of the film behind an endless amount of makeup as well).The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is not a bad film, but it is not the great film it could have been either. It could have been so much stronger if Fincher was a little less of a perfectionist. Cutting a good forty minutes out would have done this movie an immense amount of good. For such an ambitious effort, it makes a lot of silly mistakes.7/10.",7,30,59,21 January 2009
Transformers," Amazing special effects cannot totally make up for how disappointing the film is
","Despite some of the negative publicity surrounding it, Transformers was one of the most hyped movies of the summer for me. The trailers suggested it was going to be an all out action-orientated blockbuster, and despite the shoddiness of some of the films in Michael Bay's repertoire, I got pretty excited for it. Sadly, it failed to meet all of my expectations, and left a rather sour taste in my mouth that has lasted for the weeks since watching it.Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is in high school, and is desperate to get his own car. He uses eBay and even his own history class to try to hawk off some of his grandfather's prized possessions in the hopes of making the money for it, but seems to be failing on all counts. Eventually, his father Ron (Kevin Dunn) caves, and helps purchase one for him. It runs beautifully, despite some rather strange occurrences in the used car lot, and is just the kind of car Sam has dreamed for. But rather soon after, the car begins to move on its own, and no sooner does Sam realize this when he actually witnesses the car transform into a robot and fight another car turned robot.This is the basic set-up for Transformers, which merges in elements of government intrigue, blatant Middle East war propaganda, epic CGI action sequences, and rather absurd humour, all revolving around the Autobots (good transformers) centuries old battle with the Decepticons (bad transformers), and both of their races' search for a highly technical piece of rock that just happens to be hiding somewhere on Earth.Regardless of any fanboy pressure, Bay created the movie he wanted, and it turned out to be a totally convoluted and mixed bag. Looking away from the basics of the story, it seems like the writers and Bay himself tacked on a bit too much in the way of getting the film from point-to-point like any good highly stylized action film attempts to. Scenes with lengthy hacker technical jargon go on far beyond the point they pine for, and scenes where they attempt to go simply for laughs fall flat on their face as near frivolous wastes of time. I rarely see movies that seem to jog around the point for much longer than they should, but for a master of cuts and edits, it seems like Bay just wanted to add in every idea any writer could have ever had for this film, and just make the film a lot more bulky in its running time than it needed to be. It just begs of needing a qualified editor to tell Bay just when enough is. It ruined the near great concept he had in The Island, and it almost ruins everything here.But the story is really secondary here to the CGI. And does that ever deliver on the promises of the trailers. Every transformer looks sleek and polished, to the point of looking above and beyond realistic. Their interactions with each other, and even human characters is at a level of animation that is rarely seen with mainstream films. Where the likes of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix just has their characters look almost blatantly fake in front of their CGI backgrounds or characters, the animators on Transformers have actually taken the time to make everything look authentic and look real. Half-way through the film you stop thinking these robots do not exist, and start wondering how long it is going to take before you actually see one up close and personal. And that is just looking at them walking around, the scenes with them in battle between each other are even better (even with them being highly stylized edit-wise).The voice acting is all top notch, across the board (I particularly dug the ever reliable Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime yet again, and Hugo Weaving as Megatron). The real actors acting is not as great. LaBeouf does his best to support the robots, and pulls off a fairly decent performance. We have obviously seen him in much stronger roles demanding much more of his acting capabilities, but for the little amount of real acting he has to do here (which does not include the running, screaming or genuine awe at what is going on in front of him), he does pretty adequately. His mandatory love interest, Mikaela (Megan Fox), does about as much as her gorgeous one-dimensional character needs to. The rest of the supporting cast, rounded out by Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro (in his most uselessly over-the-top performance ever) and Jon Voight, all do sufficiently enough, but like all the supporting characters in Bay films, basically serve the function of helping the film move from beginning to middle to end (and of course, help explain the jargon being employed by the extras).But while the film may have its follies, what truly destroys the foundations it successfully employs, is the deliberate product placements scattered throughout the movie. Unlike the cartoon versions of Transformers, almost every single car is a brand name one. Mentions of eBay literally fly through character's mouths, and there's even a whole two minute long conversation about how great Nokia is. I understand the need for product placement, but when the film dwindles on these symbols for more than a mere second, it just shows me how unashamed these filmmakers were in creating this film. If I wanted to see an advertisement for cars, phones, Burger King and Mountain Dew, I would sit through a television commercial or read a magazine.It disgusted me to see just how far Bay and company milked the placements, and to me, stands as the one true killer of everything that Transformers has going for it. Yes, it is a fairly good action film with some amazing effects, but at the price of being one huge commercial.7/10.",7,3,6,19 August 2007
Children of Men," Visually astounding, but the storyline lacks depth
","I am not sure why, but Children of Men never stuck with me as one of the must-see movies of the latter half of 2006. It looked interesting yes, but never seemed to be anything more. But curiosity got the better of me, and despite being disappointed by the film, I can still honestly say I was visually astounded.The film takes place in Britain in late 2027. War has plagued and destroyed many of the world's nations, and Britain, albeit in ruins, is the only real nation left standing. Activists are continually trying to undermine the government. At some point, women became infertile, and thus, no children have been reproduced for almost twenty years. The film opens on a television broadcast announcing that the youngest person alive had been murdered, and thus, has left many people in tears.Theo (Clive Owen), a public servant and former activist, seems very numb to this depraved act, and just tries to continue living his borderline alcoholic lifestyle. Soon after, he is picked up by a group called The Fishes, who just happen to be lead by his ex-girlfriend Julian (Julianne Moore). She wants him to get the necessary papers to allow a woman in their care to get to an unseen group called 'The Human Project', who are championing the human cause and trying to discover a cure for infertility. He gets the papers, and has to escort the woman, Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to this sanctuary, only to find out later that she has somehow become pregnant.What follows is a slow-moving, thrilling spectacle that just has one key problem inherent within it: it is far too straightforward. The movie sets itself up within its first thirty minutes, and then does not waver at all afterwards. It just becomes a race to see if Kee can be saved after all, and very little by way of surprises or subplots occur. The characters are all transfixed on that one goal, and thus, never develop completely. Theo develops within the first act when he decides to take on the mission, and then just stays the same throughout the rest of the film. And this becomes really disheartening because it was all shown in the trailer. Despite being well written and darkly humorous, the film just becomes a tad too predictable, and really falters as a result. This could potentially be blamed on the source material (a novel written in the early 1990's by P.D. James), but you would think the filmmakers would have changed it up a bit to make it more of an appealing storyline to follow, and not just get exhausted with.Although there is little to no development of the characters, the acting is all very well done. Owen is wonderful as the protagonist, and brings a great emotion to his character that would undeniably be missing had another actor taken on the role. Relative newcomer Ashitey also does a great job as Kee. She has just the right amount of believability and pain to full this character off. She breathes life into Kee, and we get to reap the benefits as the audience. Supporting turns from Moore, Michael Caine, and Pam Ferris are all well done. I was a little disappointed with Chiwetel Ejiofor, only for the fact that he is such a great actor, and his role had less than enough scenery for him to chew through.But while the story and characters are plagued by a few problems, the visuals are where this movie really shines and is reason enough to see the film. Writer/director Alfonso Cuarón and his crew have created a disgustingly vibrant dystopia that ranks as one of the best depictions I have ever seen in the film medium. Settings and backgrounds are dark and dirty. It stinks of having been defiled by all the citizens who once lived and loved the land, but have now destroyed it. This is a place no one wants to live, and is the stuff of people's worst nightmares. A totalitarian and fascist Britain was already shown this year quite excellently in V for Vendetta, and Children of Men succeeds in trumping that film (by visual means only). It is so simplistic yet so complicated. Just the sheer idea of trying to bring some of these visuals to screen really boggles my mind, and shows just how much enthusiasm these people had for the work.The cinematography and editing are just outstanding. Everything is stark, and to the point (much like the film to my dismay). It really becomes a blessing and a curse with much of how the various shots were filmed. At some points, they are clever and well framed. And at others, they are done through the use of a handy-cam, and the audience feels as if they are a character alongside Theo and everyone else. The screen shakes frequently, and it gives it a hint of authenticity. This dystopia is all the more real and frightening. It dazzles with how much detail is put into some of this work, and really becomes outstanding during some of the unedited long shots that take place over many minutes of screen time. One battle sequence goes on for at least five minutes, and it is just the cameraman running behind Owen as he dodges certain death. It amazes and it terrifies all at once. Unfortunately, the effect of these hand-held shots is lost in the fact that it becomes annoying after so many straight intervals and just becomes dizzying.Overall, the film is a bit of a mixture of good and bad. On one hand, the story is interesting, but just stays too straight and narrow to make it anything more. On the other, the visuals are absolutely stunning and have obliviously had a lot of time spent on them. This film is a terrifyingly real experience as a result, and really stands out as a result.8/10.",8,1,4,6 January 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A great film, but an acquired taste
","The last Best Picture nominee for me to view for the year, and while it does not disappoint, it is not on par with some of the other films nominated.George Clooney has officially become more than a pretty face. The entire construct of the movie is excellent, and I'm glad that Clooney has reaped some of the benefits that have come from it. The cinematography is utterly fantastic, and the entire storyline is fascinating (from a future journalist's point-of-view). David Strathairn is perfect as Murrow, and the rest of the supporting cast is spot-on, even if they get very little screen-time to chew (as is the case with poor Robert Downey Jr.).The entire dramatized fight between Murrow and McCarthy, and everything leading up to it, is done very well, and the excellent use of black and white photography just makes it all the more better. I had never liked black and white films before, but as I keep seeing movies like this, I wish it was used more often. It looks just gorgeous for the time period, and adds to the authenticity. The use of the actual footage from the trials is also, a really good touch.Although there is a bit too much smoking going out throughout the entire film (maybe one or two people don't light up at one point or another), it only adds to the beautiful imagery and photography of the picture. Plus, Clooney makes up for it with the humorous advertisements seen within the film.If there is anything wrong with the movie, its that the entire thing seems a bit dry. Everything is authentic, but the fact that a modern audience would not be as captivated as a 1950s audience would leaves a lot to be said for the film. The first hour moves along fairly briskly, but then the last 30 minutes just drags on. It's nowhere near as boring as the likes of Capote, but there is still a lot to be said for the fact that it tumbles a bit just as its peaking.A great movie, but an acquired taste is needed in order to find any enjoyment from it. George Clooney may get passed this year for everything he did with this film (maybe not for Syriana), but if he keeps up making films like this, Oscar will surely come knocking soon enough.8/10.",8,1,2,22 February 2006
Evil Dead," A satisfying and brutally bloody mess of a remake
","When I initially heard about a remake to Evil Dead, I was a little disappointed. I was never a huge fan of the original film, but the sequels remain two of the most wildly entertaining films I have ever seen. With my doubts in mind, everything changed the moment I saw the first red-band trailer. And now after catching a screening of the film last week, I wonder why I doubted Fede Alvarez's re-imagining in the first place.Five friends venture to a cabin to help Mia (Jane Levy) kick her drug habit. Things are not as they seem from the very start, but it only gets worse after Mia's claims she was attacked by a demon in the forest. Her friends just think she is adjusting badly to going cold turkey, but strange occurrences start to take place within the cabin, and it quickly becomes obvious that Mia is not quite herself. I went in with low expectations, but Alvarez does a great job bringing the film to life. It hints at and replays certain key moments from the original series, but for the most part, Evil Dead is very much its own individual thing: a re-imagining that exists all on its own. The story is not all too important here, but it does more than enough to move the film along from beginning to end; something the horror remake genre has botched all too often. Better yet, Evil Dead never feels like it is struggling to live up to lofty comparisons, and seems very content at having fun mercilessly torturing these five young people. Fans will love seeing how Alvarez reinterprets some of the franchise's most popular scenes, but non-fans will still get a hint of glee seeing just how depraved the film quickly becomes. It may take a while to get there, but it never lets up afterwards.The trailers and marketing elements suggest that the film is terrifying. Indeed the trailer was absolutely horrifying. But I found myself not so much scared as why I was mortified by some of the kills and ludicrous ideas inflicted on the cast. I say ideas mainly because some things that happen should result in a criminal diagnosis on everyone involved. The film is definitely not for the squeamish, and revels in the amount of blood and gore it spills at every turn. It uses the original franchise as a barometer, and then throws it out the window in favour of being more 'inventive' and eclectic with its choices. The trailers may have prepared you for some of the brutality, but it only hints at the lingering after-effects. Expect to hear a lot about the vivid and fully realized makeup effects – they are so much better than you could have ever imagined, and are light-years ahead of the minuscule CGI effects employed during the film.For how enjoyable and loving a tribute this re-imagining is to Raimi's work, there is still plenty wrong with it. Roque Baños' score, although tense throughout, is way too serious and overbearing for the film. It helps create plenty of frightening moments sprinkled generously throughout the film, but I feel like it belonged in a much different film. It never gels quite properly with the tone of the film, and feels off even in the minute sections where it does work. Much the same goes for the prologue that opens the film – a totally new invention of Alvarez and crew. It tries to set the tone for what is coming, and tries its very best to totally set itself apart from the original films (even going so far as to introduce an actual 'identity' to the demons possessing the precocious young adults), but ends up feeling totally out of place. About halfway through the film, I forgot it even happened because of how little it affects what comes after. Why bother adding it in the first place?While I take issue with a number of idiosyncrasies involving a bizarre third act twist I should have seen coming, my bigger concern is with the characterization of everyone except Mia. Their driving force is to help her get better and rid her of her drug dependency, but they seem to have no other motivations outside of that. Lou Taylor Pucci's character Eric unleashes the demons in the first place, but he never really gives any hint of why he commits this act of malice or even how he can read it so well. Elizabeth Blackmore's Natalie is a glorified stage prop, frequently disappearing for whole scenes at a time, only to reappear when the film suddenly needed her to be on hand for reaction shots. The only reason I had any idea of who this character is supposed to be was because she shows up with Fernandez at the beginning of the film. Should she have already been hanging out at the cabin, I do not think we would have been afforded that luxury. But I digress. For what it is, and for what I can only assume most people expected, Evil Dead is a satisfying, albeit bloody mess of a movie. It does enough right, and does an admirable job being its own film – as opposed to coasting along on the tail of the original film. With a little bit more work, this could have been a significantly greater film. But whether you look at it as pieces or in the sum of its parts, it is more than worthwhile to see.7.5/10.",7,113,277,23 March 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's comeback does not disappoint
","Kill Bill: Volume 1 marked the return of Quentin Tarantino, one of the most innovative directors of our time, after a six-year hiatus (his previous film being 1997's disappointing Jackie Brown). Even though it was split into two parts, the first two hours of Tarantino's epic bloody masterpiece still resides with me as the better of the two.While this film really does not get into much of the key story line that Volume 2 taps into, it still introduces us to 'The Bride' (Uma Thurman). She's a deadly assassin who was once part of what was known as the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. She decides to leave the squad one day, settle down and create a family. The squad feels otherwise, and their leader, Bill (David Carradine), sends the squad to kill her. The entire wedding party is decimated, and they leave The Bride for dead with a bullet in her head. Four years pass where The Bride is in a coma, and what proceeds after she awakes, is the start of a personal vendetta to kill all the members of the Viper Squad who ruined her life.It may not sound like much coming from an auteur like Tarantino, or very original for that matter, but his brilliance makes it original. Through his stylish use of dialogue, story telling, martial arts and especially camera angles, he creates an absolutely amazing film that makes us remember why he was anything to talk about in the first place (along with a beautifully drawn anime sequence). This film is something to see to believe. It has its intensely violent moments, but it's done so tastefully that it ends up looking like a modern piece of artwork, and not something horrifically violent. The choreography in every scene is just so perfect, that it cannot be seen as anything but art. His gigantic colour palate, flying between uses of black and white, to all sorts of colours, is just astonishing. It really brings into question why this film missed out on an Art Direction nomination at the Academy Awards that year (or any award for that matter). It is intensely violent yes, but the way it is done is artful and brilliant. Thurman is fabulous as the blood-soaked weeping Bride, and she makes for a great anti-hero for the ages. The way she comes at this role is just so hard-nosed and strong, that it gives wonder to where all this acting talent has been bottled up for so many years. A faceless Carradine serves as the main antagonist, and serves excellently in the scheme of things. The supporting cast, featuring Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and Sonny Chiba all are perfect in their roles, no matter how short. But the real supporting character to watch for is Chiaki Kuriyama, who first got noticed in Battle Royale. She had a bizarrely frightening aura about her there, and it translates flawlessly to her role here. For as small as the role gives her, she steals the show, and proves her worth. If only she could continue getting roles like these.Another key greatness to the film is in the music. As has become standard for Tarantino, much of it is ported over from old tunes from the likes of much older Japanese Martial Arts films. But, just like those older Tarantino films, they flow beautifully into the film. Every blood soaked arts filled image has excellent and memorable music to go behind it that leave powerful visual images in the viewer's mind. They give it an authentic and distinct feeling that is so much different than most modern Hollywood made film. In a way, it just shows how Tarantino can make every facet of the picture work, and make it visually astonishing to the eyes.As long as you can stomach the intense graphic violence, Kill Bill: Volume 1 is not one to have missed out on since it's initial release. This homage to the great Martial Art films of yesteryear is both insightful and brilliant. Tarantino has returned with a vengeance, and I can only pray he keeps it up.10/10.",9,3,8,16 May 2006
Saw II," Fails to capture the spirit of the original film
","Saw II is clever like the first, but definitely not as good.Whereas the first was original, and genuinely scary at times, this movie just fails to live up to it. It's an alright movie, don't get me wrong. But nowhere near on par with the original (which wasn't all that amazing to begin with).The acting is alright for what it is. Donnie Wahlberg does Cary Elwes proud with the really bad overacting, and everyone else just makes an attempt with what they have to work with. Adding more characters was not a step in the right direction.But the entire movie just feels a bit rushed. Yeah, there are many nods to the original film, but the rest of it is just there. Characters are dismissed all too quickly, and the characters that stay are not the least bit interesting. There are a few shock moments, but it loses a lot of the terror the original packed. The terror made it jump so far ahead of modern horror films, especially ones coming from the United States, and it just is not the same here. Those few moments are also marred by some fast editing that really takes away from it all. The ending rocks hard when it comes, but everything leading up to it just feels a little forced, like they had the ending, but just needed to come up with some filler to get to it.While both movies failed to really captivate, this one just doesn't leave the same feeling with you afterwards that the original did. And that's a shame.6/10.",6,0,0,22 February 2006
Clash of the Titans," Entertaining enough for a throwaway laugh or gasp
","I watched the original Clash of the Titans merely days before the new remake to try and understand why it has become such a cult classic since its original release back in 1981. While people will tell you it is one of those films that are so bad it slowly becomes good, I actually found the film to be quite entertaining. It was by no means a great film, but it had heart and an epic scope limited only by its need to employ the effects of Ray Harryhausen.Enter the remake, or reimagining as it so conveniently seems. As the people of Argos lash back against the Gods, including Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes), the Gods start to lash back. Caught in the crossfire is Zeus' bastard son Perseus (Sam Worthington), who seeks revenge against the Gods, but quickly finds out it is his destiny to save the townspeople and to help Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) from being sacrificed to the mythic Kraken.What was charming about the original film was its lack of dimensionality and complications. Perseus is raised and trained to fight against the Gods, and find his calling in saving Andromeda out of love. The plot was focused entirely around him, and the Gods took a back seat to his storyline. Hell, there really is no specific bad guy in the film at all. In the remake, it seems like they attempted to pile on as much story as they comprehensively could, cutting out certain Gods almost entirely (or having them stand almost as a placeholder and do next to nothing, such as Danny Huston's Poseidon or Alexander Siddig's Hermes), cutting out or changing characters around entirely, or curbing the screen time of some of the first film's integral characters (Jason Flemyng's Calibos immediately comes to mind).But even with the changes and the added dimensionality for some, the film lacks the heart that drove the original almost entirely. There is nothing charming here, nothing fun. Sure the film is exciting, but it lacks the pulse that made the original so enjoyable. Of course, this is not helped by the script, which plays itself out much too seriously for its own good. There are a few amusingly ridiculous one-liners sprinkled throughout (the blatant sexual euphemism 'Ease your storm' is a gem that sticks out), but the majority of the dialogue jumps quickly in scale of bad to worse. There was a reason huge chunks of the original film did not have any dialogue. Apparently the filmmakers here did not get the memo, and decided to jump amp up the silly dialogue as much as they could at any moment they could. And was there really a reason to replace Bubo the mechanical owl with a not so subtly camouflaged ripoff of Chewbacca? Acting wise, the film is entirely hit and miss. The majority of performers are lifeless, and emotionally banal. While Neeson and Fiennes do their best to overcome the contrivances of the script, you can tell almost immediately that they really have no place in a film like this. They are much stronger thespians than that (although Fiennes appears to be channelling his inner Voldemort in far too many scenes). While it is nice to see them in a goofy picture like this, I find it very disheartening to note the last film they appeared in was Schindler's List. Bond veterans Gemma Arterton and Mads Mikkelsen seem to get the juiciest material in the whole picture, but both lack the real charisma and drive for the audience to really care about their characters, or their relationships to anyone else. Davalos fares even worse, seemingly making even a damsel in distress look difficult to pull off.Worthington is the glue that holds the film together, and for the most part he does well. Even when he is clearly being held back or delivering the silliest pieces of dialogue, he still has the emotional presence to carry the film and make you care about his plight for revenge. I was not overly excited about the overly cliché revenge plot, or that he was playing an off-shoot of Jake Sully from Avatar here, but he still manages to make the character unique enough to stand alone. He may have been a breakthrough in Terminator Salvation, and simply great in Avatar, but here he merely maintains his status as an excellent newcomer. I look forward to his next film with great trepidation.While there are a few bad green screening moments (and a few throwaway shots clearly thrown in to appeal to 3D viewers), the special effects are quite excellent. Gone is the stop motion and claymation of the original film, and in its place are CG effects that make everything look more realized that I imagined (and even include a few great makeup effects too). I was impressed by just about everything thrown at the screen (outside of the absurd scorpions), as they looked a lot better than I imagined they would. While not every scene is as polished as the next, they all come away looking very well done.I did not expect a whole lot from Clash of the Titans going on what the trailers offer us, but having the shell of the original story still in place works in its favour. The film, even at its worst, still manages to be entertaining enough for a throwaway laugh or gasp. Although it is done in a more epic way in the God of War video game series and with more heart in the original film, there are still some things to like about the film. It is not a great film by any means, and it likely will never find the cult classic status its brethren did. But it is enjoyable enough, and could have been so much worse.4.5/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",4,3,7,7 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," One of the most suspenseful and thrilling theatrical rides you will ever take
","I never saw The Blair Witch Project (I saw it's very rarely mentioned predecessor Cannibal Holocaust, which I try to forget), but I imagine the pandemonium and terror that filled theatres back in 1999 was nowhere near what anxiety and horror has been brought ten years later by Paranormal Activity. The faux documentary about a young couple Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherson)'s attempts at documenting nightly disturbances by a demon in their new home is every bit as frightening and scary as you have heard. It has taken me days to figure out what to write about this heavily demanded film, and I remain just as much on edge now as I was after seeing the film.For just under ninety minutes, Paranormal Activity acts as the ride you really want to take but immediately regret hopping onto. Filmed for an incredibly small amount of money, this two-year-old indie horror flick falls into the same company as District 9 in how much it accomplishes for its genre with so little. It offers an excessive amount of pulse pounding scares, and two fantastic leads that we actually care about. We only learn a small amount about either character, but the performances by these two amateur actors is more than enough to make us feel their pain and dread as they try to figure out why the demon is tormenting them night after night. This is what true horror is, and now that it is has struck gold at the box office, I can only hope horror films in pre-production take note on what this film does right.The reason the film works is right in its set-up. The film takes place entirely in and around the couple's house, and is all shot on a camcorder that Micah purchases at the very beginning of the film. Right away, director/writer/editor Oren Peli sets up the film to jump between the couple's interactions with each other and guests during the day and their sleeping during the night. The audience acts as voyeurs for the majority of the film, watching the two sleep while the unexpected takes place with little notice. It makes for a very uneasy picture, as the pair does not always wake up to scary things happening in their bedroom. They frequently only discover the same horror we have seen the next day as they examine the footage. The times they do wake up lead to some of the most terrifying sequences in recent memory.But the sequences are only terrifying because of how the audience reacts to them. I saw the film in a sold out theatre, and you could hear a pin drop during the night time scenes. Everyone was filled up with trepidation and breathlessly expecting the worst each time. And while the film is merely only freaky (and slightly boring) for the first half hour before kicking into high gear, the audience reacted the exact same way to each scene at night. The collective exhale as the day scenes began is something that simply must be marveled at. I do not think there has been a movie in recent memory that has impacted an audience so unified the same way Paranormal Activity does. It practically screams that it needs to be experienced with an audience in order to get the true effect of what Peli and crew envisioned when they made the film.Another source of wonder is the special effects. While many of the effects are practical and are pulled off with ease, some of the later effects will simply horrify you into trying to figure out how they were possible on such a small budget. They are so simply and effectively done that they make Michael Bay's bloated effect-filled epics like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen pale in comparison. They are just so tastefully done and used so well that you have no choice but to try and figure out how they were pulled off with so little an amount of money. They look far too real to be fake.While I really enjoyed the ride Paranormal Activity provides, I cannot help but be disappointed at the fact that the film will never provide the same experience more than once. It was clearly not made for repeat viewing, and it hurts the film as a whole in the end. The scares and effect of the film was not made to be seen in the same way as a Saw film or a Friday the 13th film would be. Sure, there may be some new things to discover that you did not see before, but the film is ruined ultimately by only being effective enough to scare once. I imagine a lot of people will think one viewing is enough, but for someone who watches movies more than once, it will no doubt sadden you. If I did see the film again, I imagine I would be watching simply to see the reactions of the audience, not feel as immersed into the film as I was during the first viewing.The triumph of Paranormal Activity is in the fact that it was made for so little, but has the ability to terrify so many. It works on so many levels that its few faults are more than easily redeemed. The film is short enough to not overstay its welcome, and scary enough to make even the most hardened film-goer wince in fear. It's the most suspenseful trip to the movies I have ever taken. And if not anything else, it speaks to a young generation of future filmmakers the same way District 9 did. If you have an idea for a story, the equipment to pull it off, and a little bit of time and money to invest into it, then there is no stopping what you can create.8/10.",8,11,22,28 October 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," Another example of why science fiction and romance rarely mix
","Forgive me if this sounds hopelessly derivative: a rising politician named David Norris (Matt Damon) meets up with a ballerina named Elise (Emily Blunt) by chance on the night of a major election. They part ways, but David cannot seem to get her out of his head. By chance they meet again, and David remains smitten with this mysterious woman. When he enters his office, he finds an odd group of individuals who call themselves the titular Adjustment Bureau. Apparently they are a group who ensure people act according to a plan that is predetermined for them. And a relationship between David and Elise is not part of the plan.Going into The Adjustment Bureau, I only knew of the short story by revered sci-fi icon Philip K. Dick. But going by the track record of successes, failures and cult classics based on his work, I assumed this film would at the very least be worth a look just because of the legacy of films his writings have created. Sadly, going by the plot synopsis I described above, I am certain you can guess which category this film falls into fairly quickly.When The Adjustment Bureau is focusing on the concept of people's lives being pre-determined and how free choice adds to the mix, it delivers in near remarkable fashion. Seeing how the 'Adjustment Team', who are referred to mainly by their last names, works and how omnipresent they are in people's lives is downright thought-provoking on the same level as Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report, and just as intriguing. This is the kind of material science fiction has always worked best on, and some of the things that happen are just as fun and unique as you can imagine. I would have loved to learn more about the notebooks these team members read like gospel, and would have greatly enjoyed significantly more emphasis on these elements.What also impressed me was the lack of obvious special effects used throughout the film. There are a few scenes which looked blatantly enhanced by CGI, but the majority looks practical in nature. This can be chalked up to the fact that the film is not one that needs to be drenched in effects (unlike so many other science fiction pieces), but the simplicity and nuances of opening doors to other places and the use of real sets was something I felt worthy enough to be mentioned on its own. If only more films could follow the production examples set by this one, we would have more natural looking big-budget films.Sadly, it is the romance that wins and drowns out almost every instance of science fiction-esque explanation (minus the initial reason for why the Bureau exists in the first place). It seems like writer/director George Nolfi was merely intrigued by Dick's story, and decided to build an against-all-odds romance around it. But it feels stale in comparison to the ideas surrounding it, almost like an afterthought. The familiar and clichéd romantic beats are all here, but Nolfi never takes them anywhere exceptional – they merely stay grounded in the ordinary of whatever freakish form of reality the film takes place in. There is more than enough room for development in some scenes, and others could have become instantly more exciting if there really was something more to it.I would be a little less harsh on the romance, except it leads to one of the most ridiculously uninventive endings of the last decade. The film takes on its own liberties in the quest between David and Elise for ultimate happiness and free will, and forsakes and ruins anything intriguing and worthwhile within the plot (namely the explanations on how the Bureau acts and reacts to situations). The film's release was delayed and I think the final act may have been what was tinkered with the most in the ensuing wait. It feels choppy, weak and just not all there, like there was something more to it, something that helped make all of the romance easier to swallow by the time the credits roll.But sadly, as one moment passes into the next, each more outrageous and near farcical than the next, the horrible ending unfolds. I want to say it is the kind of movie that would benefit from ending ten-twenty minutes sooner, but even that would not help make it any less preposterous than it quickly becomes. There is a scene stuffed in here between Damon and one of the 'adjusters' played by Anthony Mackie, where Mackie looks delirious and incredibly baffled by the words he is saying to Damon. I am fairly certain I had the same look on my face trying to comprehend the inane and downright silly turn the story takes at that exact same moment.Much like he always does, Damon delivers the best performance he can with what he is given. He is never one to back down from a challenge, and he makes David a compelling character at all times. You really do feel for him, even when so much is going wrong around him. Blunt has the unfortunate task of being the beautiful background character, one that gets very little to do outside of eliciting a reaction from Damon. She looks great while doing it, but does not offer all that much here. Mackie is great when the film wants to use him, and Terrence Stamp is so deadly serious that he feels like he belongs somewhere else. But did they really need to completely undercut and make John Slattery be so useless? The Adjustment Bureau is greatly enjoyable in parts, but is never able to maintain the right focus. It is worth a look, just to see what it easily could have become, before squandering it away on melodramatic romance.6/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",6,1,3,23 March 2011
World Trade Center," Nowhere near being the bold film that it should be
","Even thinking about it days later, World Trade Center is a terrible disappointment. I was not feeling overly excited to watch the film in the first place, but the obvious idea of the subject matter is captivating. September 11, 2001 was a day that everyone can remember, and no one will forget. So having been the second film in less than six months about the subject, it had big shoes to fill. Sadly, it is not up to the task.The film, directed by controversial Oscar-winner Oliver Stone, focuses around two PAPD officers trapped under the wreckage of the World Trade Center following its collapse. Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) has a wife, Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and a child with another on the way. John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage), is an expert on the towers, and has a wife Donna (Maria Bello), and four children. The film goes back and fourth between these four characters, simultaneously showing the pain that Jimeno and McLoughlin are being forced to face, and their wives, hoping and waiting to hear that their husbands are alive.The storyline is very simple, and I think this is where the film finds itself in trouble. When it starts out, it paints itself to be about the towers. Many blatant scenery shots of the New York City skyline have them both emblazed in the background almost like a huge target. They are totally in your face, and even if you have no idea where to look for them in really far shots, you can still find them right away. When the planes hit, we do not actually see the impact, but the chaos taking place on the ground does feel authentic, and well done. I liked the shadow of the plane on the huge skyscraper moments before it hit, but was less impressed by the unrealistic CGI shot of the burning building. Likewise, when the police crew watches a person tumble to their death, the poignancy and meaning to this person's ultimate death is so contrived that it almost looks like we should laugh at as a CGI effect, it looks awful. As well, out of a just over two hour film, the trade center only appears in less than the first thirty minutes.Another thing I disliked was how the movie was based entirely around the two characters, with little to nothing being actually about the trade centers, other than the event that causes their problem. If the movie is going to be called, World Trade Center, you would assume the film would be about the event a whole lot more. Yes, there are the media coverage scenes, and the very well captured early moments of on-the-street chaos. But as the film goes on, there is really nothing to distinguish that the film is about the trade centers at all. It is almost as if it could be about any other disaster, maybe even a fictional one. It just feels half there, and half not. United 93 was actually about that plane and the people on it. The World Trade Center does make a small appearance in the film, but after that, is not really what the film is about anymore. I understand the poignancy and the human emotion the film wanted to evoke, but it could have been called something much different since it is about something much different.Where United 93 excelled at its fast-paced editing and its heart-racing thrills, Center just fails. Its opening is fairly fast, and almost as fast as you can snap your fingers, the trade center comes down. From there, it just kind of drags on. The characters are bland, and really have a lack of definition among them. The men want to get out, and the women want to ensure the men are alive. Okay, you can only convey that so many ways on screen before it becomes repetitive. I know they were going for some authenticity, but just having the actors do the same thing over and over again becomes tedious and loses the emotional focus at the heart of the film. We, as the audience, know the ultimate outcome of the situation, and need to have something interesting going on while the film progresses to hold our attention.United 93 shifted focus from the effect the media had on everyone watching the news footage, to the knowledge that terrorists were holding the plane hostage. We know what is coming, but director Paul Greengrass draws us in, and makes the events seem fresh and not drilled into memory. Here, Stone just wants to tell the story, and does not bother looking back or even caring whether the audience is paying attention or not. No subtext, no shift in focus, no good editing, it just stays the same and drags itself out.The acting is okay at best. Cage has seen far better days, and has put a whole lot more effort into other performances. Bello looks and feels subdued. She is clearly being held back, and her role suffers as a result. Pena is excellent, but only to a point. I really enjoyed Gyllenhaal, but like Bello, she feels like she is being held back, and not giving the role everything she has. Supporting turns from Jay Hernandez and Stephen Dorff are well done, but are barely shown. And despite his character actually being a real person, Michael Shannon takes his role far too extreme and becomes too propagandist for his own good. His over-the-top character is a real low point in the film, and had I not found out he was real, I would have assumed he was put in on purpose by Stone.On the whole, the film is just a disappointment. It has an okay storyline and a good message, but is just not the powerful film that it should have been. You are better off sticking with the far superior United 93.6/10.",6,0,2,3 February 2007
The Dark Knight," A gritty hard-boiled thriller that will leave you breathless and wanting more
","Words cannot describe the awe I feel for The Dark Knight.I usually try and wind myself down before getting too hyped over movies, but The Dark Knight was different. This was a Batman movie, almost completely like no other.Somehow, despite being immensely hyped for it, The Dark Knight basically shattered all of my expectations and more.The film focuses on four different characters. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) is still playing the vigilante Gotham loves and fears, but is wrestling with his commitment to the job. Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) is one of the few good cops left, and is trying to end the crime. Newly elected District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is fighting against the scum of Gotham, and trying to make it a safe place again. And of course, there's The Joker (Heath Ledger), a psychopathic terrorist determined to ensure chaos rules Gotham City.The film handles these plot threads rather delicately. It knows that with the slightest force, it could throw the entire course of the film off. For every moment of greatness these stories development, it reverts and dodges bumpy, cliché-ridden paths. It works because it aims to be unique the whole way through. Writer/director Christopher Nolan (with the help of his brother Jonathan) bit off a lot putting this movie together, but in their dedication to detail and to an inherently complex story, it manages to feel simplistic (and somehow manages to add a bit of emphasis on smaller plot lines involving mobsters and a love triangle between Wayne, Dent and fellow D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal, replacing Batman Begins' horrendously weak link Katie Holmes)).But in accomplishing the complete synthesis of the main plot lines, the Nolan brothers have also managed to make a truly one of a kind film. Yes, it does build off some ideas from Begins, but it does not depend on them. This film is one that can truly stand on its own, and is an exceptional enough sequel that you do not necessarily need to see the first film to understand what happens here (although it sure does help). It tells its own story, and relies very little on previously related materials. It is what every good sequel should set out to be like. And thankfully, it revels in all the corruption and darkness that the Batman films should have always been about. The grittiness and fearlessness of this film is unlike almost any comic book film ever made, and I doubt it will soon be replicated.But in creating such a screenplay, there is an inherent issue with length. Batman Begins felt a bit too longwinded, and could have rather easily been trimmed. The Dark Knight on the other hand, while it feels too long for true comfort, does not have any bulky areas. It is very spot-on with its scenes, and nearly every scene has a reason to be in the film. If anything was to be done away with, I think the film would have been a much less and not so fulfilling effort (not to mention would lose its thrilling edge it keeps up for the entirety of the movie). So while it does feel a bit too lengthy, it lacks the superfluous nature that films like these usually have. I could have appreciated a few changes made to a near ending action sequence (as it felt a bit too ridiculous and rushed for its own good), but it could have been a whole lot worse.Another area the film shines in is the impeccable special effects. Every last detail is perfect, and not once did I not believe what I was seeing. It amps up everything Begins had, and makes it better. Specific scenes that would have looked horrendously fake years ago look miraculous here. And the speed fighting that plagued Begins has disappeared to a certain extent, leaving the audience a much better way of seeing the action. And of course, the makeup to bring both villains to life (especially a certain 'Two-Faced' character) is beyond extraordinary. It is downright terrifying for how real it looked, at any time.Acting wise, everyone does a fairly great job.Bale, while overshadowed more so than last time, builds upon his pathos-ridden superhero and brings certain three-dimensionality to him. We can see the hurt in his eye, and can see the pain. Even when the majority of his face is covered, he brings an excellent sense of emotion to the character. Much the same goes for Eckhart's Harvey Dent, who spends most of the movie doing what he thinks is right. He is a boy scout for the ages, and delivers a richness and depth to the character I did not think possible. Oldman does another superb job playing Gordon. He was an anchor in Begins, and here he does even more work.Gyllenhaal, while a much better thespian than Holmes, is not given nearly enough to do here. She is not totally useless, but she looks and sounds held back by the confines of the role. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are used very sparingly as well, but when they appear, they do a great job.Which leaves me with Ledger's Joker.Just about everything you have heard about his portrayal is true. He is a complete psychopath, and is totally unrecognizable in the role. You may laugh at some of his shenanigans, but then will take them back when you see the horrifying things he says and does. This brilliant performance is even better than I could have hoped, and is enough to see the movie alone. He may have died, but you will wish he would come back and start acting the moment he opens his mouth.For its small amount of problems, The Dark Knight still manages to be uncompromising in its uniqueness and greatness. It will leave you breathless, and craving more.9/10.",9,6,14,18 July 2008
Friends with Benefits," A raunchy sex comedy that starts off sweet but becomes sour all too quickly
","I was unsure what to expect going into Friends with Benefits at an advanced screening a few weeks ago. It always seemed a bit too close in plot to No Strings Attached (made extra odd as the female leads Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman had literally just starred together in Black Swan), a film that came out less than six months ago, and while the trailers looked amusing, they seemed to look a little too close to an atypical romantic comedy. But the film actually ended up surprising me. Well, the first half at least.Jamie (Kunis) is a headhunter in New York City who helps aspiring graphic design artist Dylan (Justin Timberlake) land a prestigious job at GQ. They become good friends, and after a discussion about their relationship failures, decide to start having sex without the relationship schmaltz (hence the titular phrase). But the good times cannot stay uncomplicated for long.Rather surprisingly, the first half of Friends with Benefits is a ridiculously raunchy sex comedy that is sweeter than it is crude. The dialogue and one-liners drop at a steady pace, and there is plenty of laugh out loud moments. I was genuinely surprised at just how much I was enjoying the film, and how well co-writer/director Will Gluck (who knocked Easy A out of the park last year) helped capture the tropes and stereotypes of romantic comedies, and went entirely against them. The scene that starts the initial sexual antics is a complete dissection of the genre, and seeing the film twist and turn around the familiar plot devices was wonderful to see. It made the film feel hilarious, but also made it feel like it was attempting to do something different at the same time. Adding in a couple of random cameos from notable actors was a bit wacky (which the trailers have ruined slightly), but helped add to the humour.Except the film comes to a screeching halt just about halfway in when Jamie and Dylan come to the all too obvious realization that they may want something more. The film then becomes drastically more dramatic, a lot less sweet, and significantly more ordinary. Even the laughs suffer, landing less with a snicker and more with a groan. Everything it does to shift itself away from the romantic comedy genre feels wasted because it falls into all of the stereotypes quicker than it poked fun at them. It almost feels like they wanted to desperately feel different, and then decided to just go the safer route as opposed to sticking with its offbeat early tactics. I was really enjoying the film significantly more than I imagined, but suddenly felt bored and totally thrown off by the drastic tonal shift.While sketch comedy has proved to be one of his strong suits, Timberlake seems to have a lot of trouble carrying the film. We know he has the chops to command the screen and be absolutely magnetic (we have David Fincher and The Social Network to thank for that), but here he seems to be struggling with every other scene. He lands most of his jokes well, does decently with the dramatic bits and has plenty of chemistry with Kunis, but he lacks the spark I think most people will expect him to have in this role. He comes off as just okay, and more amateur than anything else. He would have been better suited in the film as a key supporting player, as opposed to the lead.Kunis on the other hand, is significantly stronger and proves that her turn in Forgetting Sarah Marshall may have been an early suggestion of the formidable comedic talent she may quickly become. Gluck is not able to achieve the same level of breakthrough that he got from Emma Stone in Easy A from Kunis, but she manages to carry the film almost single handedly. Even at the script's weakest moments, she grins and pushes forward, never once appearing to be struggling as much as Timberlake does. I think my only complaint against her is that she spends a good portion of the film completely nude, yet ends up wearing all too obvious pasties under a white shirt in one scene. It seems more like a complaint against a horrendously bad editing and lighting decision than against her, but it was a scene that made her seemingly-realistic character feel a whole lot less believable.Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins both deliver good performances, but sadly feel like they are just plagiarizing from characters they have played better in the past. Jenna Elfman (who I did not realize was still acting) does a little better in a warm and significantly low-key role as Dylan's sister Annie. But it is Woody Harrelson who steals the entire show as gay sports writer Tommy. He plays the character ridiculously over-the-top, but never feels like he is encroaching on any stereotypes. He makes it his own, and is almost too good in the role. He gets all of the film's best dialogue quips, and runs circles around everyone on screen. In more than one instance, Timberlake looks legitimately shocked at some of the things Harrelson says and gets away with. I think the film could have only benefited from including more of him.In the end, Friends with Benefits is both surprisingly well done and unsurprisingly ordinary. It tries so hard initially to be the anti- romantic comedy, and then just ends up falling into the same predictable elements that every other film in the genre has already done countless times before. The film is genuinely hilarious when it wants to be however, and this does save it from being a total waste. But it could have been so much more.7/10.",7,79,128,5 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Haphazard film-making makes for a rather disappointing fifth part of the series
","Even though I am only a moderate fan of the books (meaning I have yet to finish the last book, despite having it since the day it came out), I usually look at the release of a new Harry Potter as something to get excited about. Even though the quality is not always spot-on, there is just something about them that allows them to feel wondrous and fantastical all at once. And even with their numerous problems (albeit, not as bad as those associated with The Lord of the Rings trilogy), they still end up being rather enjoyable. Sadly, I think the quality has really begun to slip, as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the first film since Philosopher's Stone that actually disappointed me as a film-goer and reader of the books.I will not shed too much light on the plot (and the numerous subplots) that densely layer this fifth instalment, but suffice to say for those who have yet to venture through the book, will find Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) on thin ice with the wizarding world in regards to his accusations over the return of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). But as those close to him rally to fight against the Dark Lord, Harry just may have to face a few more problems than he probably would like to.Going in, I knew Order of the Phoenix was going to be a challenging watch. The book is the longest of the entire series, and is probably the densest. I liked it when I first read it, but subsequent re-readings of mere selections from the book have proved tiresome, and quite long-winded. Much the same then, has to go for the film. There is quite a bit going on, but you never quite feel like you are truly experiencing a genuinely well written storyline. Yes, it does feel very in tune with being just part of the larger framework of an entire series, but at least the others (with the minor exception of Goblet of Fire), have attempted to stay fairly within itself and not completely determinant on the audience having seen the previous films in order to fully understand this one.While Order of the Phoenix does pack in a whole lot more of the book than the previous film did, it does so at a price. Many of the key subplots and even key story lines have been compacted into sometimes lengthy montage sequences. And while this would not be a problem in any other movie, it quickly becomes irritating here for just how many times it is done as time progresses on. At one point, it would be safe to say two montages were split by a sheer two minute scene. And these were five-minute montages! I am certain that they could have either compacted some of these scenes even further, or just fleshed a few more out. It would have helped the characters and the story be so much more well rounded than it is.What the film also does not do is improve upon the shallow and ultimately anti-climactic ending. Instead, as hard as it is to believe, it is made worse. The initial start of the build-up towards the finale is very well done, and very well realized, but right when the real heavy hitting elements begin to pop up, the film falters. Besides not looking anywhere near what J.K. Rowling's original written words described, it feels genuinely rushed, and almost a second thought. If I had not read the book, I probably would have found much of the sequence to be rather incoherent, and other parts just totally misplaced. It just does not seem to be as well made and polished as other scenes in the movie, and everything from the acting, to the special effects, to even the story itself, suffer as a result.Speaking of special effects, what happened to them? In previous films, the artists and designers worked hard to make everything look so realistic and so well blended together that one would never realize the difference between reality and fantasy. But here, almost every effect (with a few minor exceptions, one being the awesome opening sequence of the finale) looks very haphazardly created, and with zero to no enthusiasm for what was being created. People look fake in a lot of scenes, and the totally CGI-rendered characters stand out as almost blatantly not real.But then, that is what this film really stands out to me as: a blatant unenthusiastic romp through a very messy book. The performances are all very well done (with a brilliant standout being Imelda Staunton as the quintessentially evil Dolores Umbridge), even those with very miniscule roles. But they are the only thing holding this production together. Everything is very erratically designed, but nothing feels anywhere near as magical or as fantastical as those earlier films. It just lacks the genuine zest that has become accustomed to the Harry Potter films, and replaces it with a very dull sheet of blandness. Yes, this can be blamed on Rowling's flawed fifth book, but the last four films have had even their most boring pieces cleansed over into something that feels keenly tied to the fantasy elements of the books. Here, there is a more heightened sense of realism for the actors, and not much else. It feels devoid of any of the magic that made these films so popular in the first place. Pitch black darkness content-wise is nowhere near a viable excuse for poor film-making.With its problems, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix still pulls through as being heartbreakingly average. The story is still there, and the performances are some of the best to date, but I cannot help but feel that the magic is sorely missing from this instalment.7/10.",7,7,12,1 August 2007
Blood Diamond," Could have been a lot better if it was more focused
","Leading up to its theatrical release, Blood Diamond had a lot of controversy over its depiction of the conflict diamond industry. It arrived, and was met with apprehension by critics, and did not exactly light the box office on fire. It went on to a few awards, and eventually, five Academy Award nominations. So was there actually a good movie here, or was it just overly average? Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) lives a tranquil life with his wife and three children in a village outside of Sierra Leone. One day, a group calling themselves the RUF, the Revolutionary United Front, comes blazing into the village, devastating it, and capturing Vandy. He is put to work mining diamonds, and happens to come across an extremely rare diamond everyone wants their hands on  a blood diamond. He buries it, and ends up getting arrested with much of the RUF and other prisoners. It is in prison, while having an argument with one of the leaders, that diamond smuggler Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) takes a shine to him.This description only skims the top of the immensely subplot laden film. While the essential plot is for Vandy and Archer to go and get the diamond, there is also bits with a female journalist named Maddy (Jennifer Connelly) trying to cover the conflict diamond story, the search for Vandy's son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) who has been captured by the RUF, and the whole big scheme of the international diamond sellers who are both battling complaints about accepting conflict diamonds, while they are waiting for Archer to deliver on giving them this blood diamond.It gets to be a little too much in some cases, racing around in circles and introducing characters at a moment's notice. A lot of them barely get any screen time, but they are introduced anyway and are thrown into the mix of the storyline. But even saying that, the film is downright boring in some cases. I had to turn it off because it just stopped going anywhere after awhile. It sets itself up pretty nice, but then falls into a lull that lasts for almost the entire second act. It takes long enough to get there, and even longer to reach the third. It just feels awkward, and begs of needing much stronger editing. At a sluggish 143-minute runtime, it could have done with it and could have ended up being so much more focused than it is. It is interesting, but could have been a lot shorter.Another issue is how preachy the movie gets. We understand that there is deep trouble concerning the mining for these diamonds. We do not need characters to bash us over the heads with their prolific and exhausting dialogue. In some cases, it comes naturally off the character's tongues and feels like it needs to be there in the conversations. It feels right, and only adds to the film's goal of authenticity. But in the majority, the dialogue feels like it was tacked on just to get a rise out of the audience. A call to action, sort to speak. What is worse is these moments are glaringly obvious, and make the film out to be more amateurish than it actually is. This is a big budget Hollywood production, not a film student's sociology film. Adding unnatural dialogue just for the sake of it, only stinks of trouble.The actual action and film-making techniques employed in the film are not all that bad though. The cinematography is excellent (if slightly feeling a bit too much like a take on the visually superior Children of Men), and the art direction is wonderful. The pieces of Africa that they capture are just so majestic, that even the most brutal of violence still looks great on camera. A huge gunfight sequence on the streets of Sierra Leone is well orchestrated, and is filmed gorgeously. Another helicopter raid sequence is almost right on the same par. The action is raw and gritty. It feels authentic, and also feels horrific in its brutality. The very blood reddish colours used throughout the film are a testament to this, both during scenes of massive violence and in scenes of tranquil beauty. Even the grounds walked on are red.Acting wise, everyone is a bit mixed. Hounsou is clearly the best of the bunch here, but only really begins showing the needed genuine emotion near the end of the film. He has a bit during the middle, but throughout the rest, he just has nothing. He is vastly talented, and he plays his role with an absolute desire for perfection, but he is just not totally right in every case. DiCaprio fares much worse. His accent, while being truthful to South Africa (or so I am told), is one of the most annoying things I have ever had to listen to. It works sparingly, and when his voice is not breaking into his actual American accent, just does not feel right for this film. His acting is good as always, but not up to the same calibre as Hounsou, or even himself in The Departed. He really needs to work on his inner 'scumbag' role. He is supposed to be selfish here, but he really just looks undecided in how he should act.The rest of the supporting cast is okay in their small roles (especially Kuypers). Connelly is good in her role as the journalist, and is very strong for a character I never expected to be anything more than slight eye candy. She has done much better work in the past though.Better focus on the story, and more genuine emotion would have helped this film a lot. It is too long as it is, and gets really preachy in some cases. It is an interesting, albeit flawed, film to watch, but it does the job. It just could have been a whole lot better.7/10.",7,3,5,24 March 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Simply brilliant in all dimensions of the word
","I had no idea what Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was about until the end of March. I had heard some small rumblings about it around the Internet for a few months, and also saw a few short TV trailers for it, but that was about it. Basically, all I knew was it was another dramatic Jim Carrey film, written by the same guy who wrote two of the weirdest and somehow great films to come out in a long time, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. But does this film succeed to be just as weird yet excellent as the other two? Or is it even better? A big yes on both counts would be highly appropriate.The film's main protagonist is Joel (Jim Carrey). He was in a relationship with the very free-spirited Clementine (Kate Winslet), but slowly, they began to pull apart. So, the very impulsive Clementine decides to have a wicked new procedure done to herself in which every memory of Joel is erased from her brain. Of course, Joel fails to find out right away, and only thinks upon various attempts to try to speak to her that she is simply just completely ignoring him. That is until, he finds out about the procedure from friends who were supposed to be keeping it a secret.The company performing the procedures is called Lacuna Inc. Upon heading to Lacuna for answers, Joel finds out from the head doctor, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), that he cannot be given any whatsoever, as everything is confidential. The Doctor does however, tell Joel the details of the procedure that Clementine had. After some passing time, Joel decides to have the operation done to him, on the night before Valentine's Day. So Joel goes home that night, takes the special pills given to him and falls asleep on his bed. It is then that Mierzwiak's assistants at Lacuna enter in to perform the procedure.What follows from here, is a seamless blend of both memories of Clementine and Joel within Joel's head, and the real world where Patrick, Stan and Mary (Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo and Kirsten Dunst respectively) are performing the procedure on Joel, as well as doing random things around his house. Only everything doesn't go so sweet. After the procedure's initial reactions begin to set in, Joel isn't as enthusiastic as he once was about having it done. So he begins to try to fight off the erasure. This begins to complicate things for the assistants working on him and serves for the main basis of where the film goes from that point.Despite how complicated and bizarre the film may sound, it still is a great and maybe even brilliant film. All the actors shine brightly in their performances, especially Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet. I don't think I've ever seen these two as good as they are in this, both within and outside Joel's head. Their chemistry and romance comes off very well on screen as well as being very believable. The writing is also just as good, if not even better. It must take quite the effort to continue to write films such as these, but the writer, Charlie Kaufman, is seemingly getting better and better with his scripts. By the same token, the scripts are getting stranger and stranger.The editing and look of the film is very well done as well. The film is quite jumpy in many instances, looping back and forth from activity in Joel's brain to the real world outside of it. The way the imagery is shown is quite stylish, and truly shows the complete agonizing nightmare Joel is going through. It is evident that a great deal of time was spent on the final product of the film both by the editors and the director, Michel Gondry. Although Gondry hasn't had a hit film as of yet, he does show off his excellent film-making skills with this film. Hopefully, this director will continue to excel with films like these and become much more mainstream as the years go on.I have nothing but praise for the film. It is definitely a must see. The complete brilliance of every aspect of the film is far superior to many of the 'hit mainstream' films being released in theatres these days. It can even be considered as a very early candidate for the best picture of the year. If you have the chance to see it, this film is not to be missed.10/10.",10,19,27,6 April 2004
Once Upon a Time in America," Director's Cut is too long, and nowhere near as good as I thought it would be
","I decided instead of returning it unwatched, I would actually sit through the 229 minute Director's Cut of Once Upon a Time in America. It has DeNiro and Leone, so it's gotta be really good right? Right?Nope.Like, it's not a horrible movie by any counts, but it's just way too long. Like some movies benefit from being longer, fleshing everything out, and making it great. And some movies just eat up the time, and make it seem to go by fast. This does neither.A lot of it is just purely random. Characters pop up, and don't come back. Some show up for a bit, then come back and have zero significance later on (Joe Pesci being key example). And a lot of it is just plain confusing. People are getting killed for no reason. People are arguing for no reason. Things are grazed over, and not really talked about. Things happen, and aren't explained. There's random breast rubbings with a gun barrel, random sex sequences, and just random things in general going on. There's even a wild rape scene featuring DeNiro. And after watching it, you're just left saying 'What the hell?', especially because she openly talks to him later in the movie.This is a 4 hour movie for Christ sake. You'd expect everything to be tied up by the end.Now I see why Once Upon a Time in Mexico is so flawed.But it's not all terrible. The actors are all fairly good, even if I've seen them do better stuff before (yet I still don't look at James Woods the same, ever since Videodrome). Leone's direction is great, having the trademarks of a usual Leone film (little dialog, long drawn out shots), but more focus on story as opposed to style (so sadly, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, this movie is not). And Ennio Morricone's score is just perfect.All in all, it's worth watching, if just for once. By no means is it really Leone's masterpiece as I have heard, but it's worth a look anyway. I'm just really disappointed because of the fact that it just drags for long periods of time, and isn't as stylish as I would have thought.8/10.",8,3,7,7 February 2006
Taken," Expecting less is key to even attempt enjoying it
","Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) has retired from his job, and is trying to reconnect with his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). He is divorced from her mother, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and has basically been a ghost to her while she is growing up. Kim gets the chance to go to stay in Paris for a few weeks with a friend, but needs parental permission before leaving. Bryan reluctantly signs off, but under many strict conditions, including calling him when they arrive. He finally gets a hold of her, only to listen to her being kidnapped. He vows to find her, and use all of his 'skills' to do it.It may not sound like much, but the trailer for Taken looked interesting, and sounded even better. But after seeing this all occur in the first twenty minutes, it leaves a lot to be desired for the next hour.The film, action movie or not, has virtually zero character development. In my brief description, I basically give away everything you learn about Bryan and Kim. Sure, there is a throwaway bit about Kim's intentions in Europe (which are completely unrealistic in 2009), and vague proddings at what Bryan used to do. We obviously have an idea of the type of work he was in from the way he moves, and these skills he speaks of early on, but never anything that really furthers our knowledge of him. It works in the way of him being a bit of an enigma to the audience, and really surprising everyone with what he can do, but it makes the film that much less believable.The story itself, looks like it was just culled together from half-hearted movies previous, and any form of surreal, overly choreographed action genre picture from the last ten years. No The Matrix does not take a ripping here, but anything featuring Jet Li, Jason Statham and the like does. Hell, I have not even seen Banlieue 13 (or District 13 as we better know it in North America), and I know this movie is stealing from it. Taken even throws in some torture scenes just to leave no post-9/11 stone untouched. Have action films gotten so stale that you can easily tell which pieces of other films got thrown into a blender to create this one? Is it really that hard to create something as unique or at least vaguely different like Wanted, Iron Man, or even The Dark Knight? Even No Country for Old Men has more interesting action scenes. It just feels like we have seen it all before, but the film tries to make it feel more original by throwing Neeson, an actor who has done such varied work in his career, into the mix.The editing, in a sense, makes and breaks the film. On one hand, the film is never boring. It moves at such a rapid rate that you may find standing up to leave even faster than you sat down. Sure, the film adds in an entirely unneeded subplot about a popular singer (Holly Valance) and completely does away with Kim's friend Amanda (Katie Cassidey) all too easily. But the shell of a one-dimensional, point A to point B film that is left over is quite easy to just sit through without drifting off. The film moves at such a hyper-kinetic pace that it will leave you virtually no time to breathe or take anything in (if you can even manage to see the majority of the action scenes as it is). And with such a shoddily written plot, that may work out in the filmmakers' favour.I think what it comes down to, is that I just expect more from Luc Besson. Since The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc he has done very little directing, and has spent more time writing. And looking at his writing credits, it is easy to see where a lot of films since have gotten their sense of action. But Besson is stronger than that. Look no further than The Fifth Element, Nikita (La Femme Nikita) or one of my own favourite action movies, Léon (The Professional). The man is a visualist who I imagine can write almost as well as he can direct. Thinking this, why has Taken fallen so far from these other three films? Yes, Element and Nikita are nowhere near the brilliance of Léon, but they had a very genuine feel and style missing from almost every film Besson has written since (with exceptions to the heavily underrated Danny the Dog (Unleashed) and even to a small point, The Transporter). Has he really lost the touch after so short a period of time? Neeson does what he can with what he is given (read: not much). For such a vastly underdeveloped character, he makes him work and feel human. We feel his pain as he struggles to find his daughter, and we can see the remote expressions he gives suggesting what this guy must have gone through in all his years. It is his most subtle performance in years, and he deserves credit for breathing such life into the character. The movie rests on his shoulders, and never once does he take it for granted. I only wish he could have picked something better to act in, the man is not going anywhere near an Oscar with movies like this.The supporting cast does what is needed and nothing more unfortunately. Again, chalk it up to the film being an action movie.I was vaguely intrigued by Taken, and if you do not expect much, you will not be disappointed. It has some nice action scenes, and Neeson makes you believe in his character. If you go in looking for any brain or substance though, you should keep on looking. Maybe rent Léon instead.4/10.",4,6,12,28 January 2009
Avatar," The most ambitious film of the decade is an incredible wonder that is worth every bit of its hype
","Do you remember the first time you saw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park? The day you watched Gollum interacting with Frodo and Sam in The Two Towers? Or even the day you first saw Star Wars? That sense of wonder, that sense of excitement, that emotional connection to something you witness on screen that was created in an effects warehouse and does not exist in the real world. That is how I hoped I would feel when I watched Avatar, James Cameron's first film since his mighty Titanic set sail back in 1997.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic marine sent to the distant planet Pandora to take part in a program where humans are being hardwired into the genetically grown bodies of the native population called the Na'vi. The mission is to become part of a clan, and learn more about the Na'vi people's culture. But not everything always goes to plan.Simply put, Avatar is an astonishing piece of film-making in all senses of the word. I had doubts that Cameron could top himself after breaking huge ground in the film-making medium with the likes of Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic, but those twelve years of documentary film-making and preparation (and maybe even helping create Aquaman) seems to have helped launch Avatar into the stratosphere. The film is difficult to describe, but it really is something to be marvelled at.The special effects that drive Avatar are some of the most advanced we have ever seen in a film. WETA has created a living, breathing world filled with a plethora of highly imaginative creatures, weapons and vehicles. Even the most sinister of beasts looks richly detailed, and awe-inspiring. There is just too much work that has been done on these creations that it is painful to even fathom how many hours it took to design everything that populates Pandora. Even the set designs and backgrounds, whether it be in the wild nature of the planet or in the militarized bases smack in the middle of it, are fully realized creations. There is no stone left unturned here, no half-assed effects in certain areas (which is more than can be said for the disgustingly effects-heavy Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen); everything has the same amount of shine and polish added to it. The added gloss of 3D effects only help to further bring these effects to life, and seeing the film in a 2D setting would just be a disservice to the crew who put in all the effort to create them.When we reflect years from now on the film, the Na'vi people themselves are undoubtedly what we will continue to discuss. These giant, slim, blue skinned humanoid creatures are sensational creations. I wanted to believe at any given moment that they were real, because they looked and sounded that good. Better yet, Cameron managed to ensure they had their own language and their own culture as well. If they were not real, then the man has gone to great lengths to ensure they are the next best thing to it. There is so much going on at any time with them that I am speechless even attempting to decipher what to say next. If the film does not revolutionize film-making as people have said it in the months leading up to its release, these special effects wonders will.The acting is extraordinary across the board, whether it be someone acting as a human or as a Na'vi. Worthington continues from his film-stealing role in Terminator Salvation with another fantastic performance here. He is just so charismatic, so emotional and so real that even with his relative inexperience, he leads the film like no one else could. Zoe Saldana does a great job as Neytiri, Jake's connection within the Na'vi people, as does Michelle Rodriguez as the fighter pilot Trudy. Joel David Moore and Giovanni Ribisi also put in some great work in supporting roles. Although I was not expecting much from her, I was really impressed by Sigourney Weaver, who has a much more significant role in the film than the trailer may suggest. But the only one who even remotely comes close to the greatness of Worthington is Stephen Lang as the villainous Colonel Miles Quaritch. He gladly joins into a club of fantastically written and even better acted bad ass Cameron-film villains. At times, he is just downright terrifying to watch as he works his magic on screen.If there is anything wrong with the film besides its nearly obscene running time (which is not as bad as it could have been), it is that it plays out slightly predictable. It is not as by-the-numbers as movies like Clint Eastwood's Invictus is, but it does not take a lot of sharp turns after the plot makes itself known. If you know anything about it at all, you probably have a fair idea of what is coming once the film starts. I appreciate that the film does have a few surprises (and its share of hokey dialogue), but there were a few areas where I wish I did not already have a solid right guess as to what was coming next.Despite issues with the script, Avatar still manages to be the single most ambitiously conceived film-making project of the decade, and the rare film that is every bit worthy of its hype. It is the type of film where you need to look past its issues, and look at the worthwhile endeavour Cameron has helped give us for what it is – a truly unique science fiction that is unlike what we have ever seen before, and will not be easily recreated. The film practically begs to be seen to be believed.Welcome back Mr. Cameron. Hail to the king.8.5/10.",8,7,15,18 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Not quite Evil Dead IV, but Sam Raimi's return to horror is as ridiculously scary as it is outrageously hilarious
","Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer, looking to score a big promotion. By chance, she ends up serving the clearly sick Mrs. Ganush (Lorna River), who has just been served papers by the bank to repossess her house. Despite promising to try and give the feeble old woman more time to pay the bank back, she tells her nothing can be done. So Mrs. Ganush curses Christine, and as unexplainable events begin to happen, Christine finds out she has three days to save herself before she is literally dragged to hell.After how enjoyable a throwback the Friday the 13th remake was earlier this year, I had my doubts that I would enjoy another horror movie nearly as much. Of course, I am sure there were many doubts Sam Raimi would ever return to his roots. But Drag Me to Hell does return the legendary cult director back to the genre that first brought him fame, and the results are simply spectacular. I thought I would find some enjoyment from the film, but now wonder why Raimi ever left the genre in the first place.The film is simply a riot from start to finish. Anyone who ever liked The Evil Dead is in for a real treat with Drag Me to Hell. This is 1980's horror brought back from the dead, and served as ice cold as it gets. The film is unrelenting in its terrifying moments, and gradually becomes more horrific as it goes along. There are some genuinely frightening moments at play here, but just as many hilarious moments at the same time. All of them are played exactly as anyone who knows Raimi's early work would expect – as ridiculous and ludicrous as you never would expect. The film practically one ups itself at every turn, offering one gruesome gag after the other, really pushing the PG-13 rating out much further than anyone could have imagined. But much like its Evil Dead trilogy brethren, the film never borders on being gratuitous. Anyone expecting to see another Saw clone will be greatly disappointed by the film's slapstick, cheap scare style.Obvious homages aside, the film plays itself out with the many Raimi touches fans have come to appreciate, from the moving stationary objects to the whiplashing camera (although two Raimi mainstays are suspiciously missing). The frantic camera angles are consistent from the opening scene, right until the final frame. While there are no unique, budget-pushing Evil Dead angles, there are still enormities of unique angles staged throughout the film, giving it the lowered budget feel the film needs to work in the current film environment. It knows it is playing with bigger budgeted films, but it never attempts to feel like one of them. Instead, it feels tightly bound, and right on the directive of Raimi's earlier films. Coming off the Spider-Man trilogy, it would have been an easy mistake to make this film more in line with contemporary horror films. But Raimi wisely stuck to a tried and true formula, and its greatness shows in how absurdly entertaining the film quickly becomes.The makeup (and puppet(!)) effects are all well done, harking back to a time when cheap effects like these were a lot more common in films. But the addition of CGI in certain scenes (especially during one particular 'eye-popping' scare) just feels lazy on Raimi's part. Why make the film look and feel so low budget, but then add in really needless effects into other scenes? Yes, making these effects into effects similar to Evil Dead's would have looked even sillier than the special effects do here. But at the same time, they stick out noticeably, and look like they should not be anywhere near this film. They do go with the campy feel the film is obviously going for, but that does not give the excuse to make these effects look like they are any more needed than they obviously are not. Some of them are so laughably bad that you may not notice them, but others totally take you out of the movie and feel useless.Lohman, while a much better choice for this character than the originally cast Ellen Page, delivers a fairly solid performance for someone who is given very little to do outside of scream, be tortured and be constantly looking to continue living her life. She has just the right amount of finesse and gravitas to make the role work without looking like she is deliberately attempting to be campy. She nails her most emotional scenes greatly, and never falters in the role. She just becomes zanier as the film goes on. She is not quite on par with the man himself, Bruce Campbell, but she does a more than adequate job filling his shoes. Justin Long, as her doctorate professor boyfriend, is given even less material to work with, but still manages to pull out some decent work. Wisely, he is given very few lines to be funny with, but the few he does have make for almost as much comedy as the film itself gives. Supporting turns from Dileep Rao, David Paymer, Adriana Barraza and especially Raver are all fairly well done, and work off Lohman quite well. They each get their moments to shine, and do wonderful jobs helping the movie to be as fun as it is.In the end, if you go in expecting something on the lines of The Evil Dead, then you will love Drag Me to Hell. It is a twistedly awesome return to form from Raimi, with few faults. It is obviously not perfect, but then a movie like this could never have been expected to be. Loaded with plenty of cheap scares and lots of laughs, could you really have hoped for anything better? 8/10.(An edited version of this review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",8,1,4,31 May 2009
Grindhouse," As uproariously funny, perversely disgusting and outrageously awesome as everyone hoped it would be
","When I first heard about Grindhouse, I was pretty excited. I have enjoyed practically everything Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez have ever done, so the idea of such a nostalgic homage as Grindhouse really peaked my interest. I was really hyped for the movie, and managed to snag free passes to an advanced screening, and was it ever worth it.Grindhouse consists of two very different films. The first, Planet Terror, is directed by Rodriguez and is a horror movie about zombies. The second, Death Proof, is directed by Tarantino and is a thriller about a crazed killer who murders women with his car.Just knowing these two simple plot lines is enough. They are two stand alone films, and they are just as awesome as I thought they would be. This is the closest to a true homage that either director has ever done, and it works amazingly on screen. I was never a big on watching real grindhouse-style films, but these two films are exactly what I would expect them to be like. Just watching the films together was an experience that is simply unmatchable.I was not expecting anything more than an obscene amount of violence, but the films were a lot more than that. Despite some missing reels, both films have just enough story to actually make them work as conventional films. As said previously, they could easily stand alone away from each other, and still be just as good (but probably not as awesome as they are back-to-back). Having part of the films missing really does not even matter, they work that well without them, and have all the trademark carvings of a Rodriguez or Tarantino film. Planet Terror drags on a bit near the finale, but that seems only because Rodriguez tried to pack in a lot more story to offset the action than the premise really set out for it too. Death Proof is loaded with dialogue, but it comes off brisk and so much faster paced. But all the same, both stay very much in tone with their particular genre.The missing reels are only a complement to the fact that both of the film's actual picture quality is intentionally absolutely terrible. The films (more so Planet Terror) are scratched up and tarnished to the point where some scenes are practically unwatchable. You just stop seeing the action on screen, and only notice how beat up the print is. It looks old and worn out. And it works wonderfully, and makes the experience all the more authentic. The DVDs will not look anywhere near as stylistically worn as the films do here. Watching these films in perfect quality would just ruin the true homage-style the pair were going for.The violence in both is another key element to the true impact of both films. Both are quite obscenely violent, and just become downright disgusting in a lot of sequences. They set out to push the limits of conventional 2007 era violence, and they more than do that. People are decapitated, ripped limb from limb, and just shot left, right and center. These people are destroyed beyond all comprehension, and just when you think they have done enough, it just keeps coming. Gorehounds will be in heaven, and those who have trouble looking at more than the slightest hint of blood may need to sit this one out. It gets to the point of being sick and twisted, but it works beautifully in the films, and they just would not be the same without it. The makeup artists put in a lot of work here, and it shows in how graphically violent the films are.But by pushing it to the limits, the films also become darkly hilarious. It is not just the dialogue that will give you a chuckle, it is the effects and the action happening on screen. In some places, it just becomes so downright ridiculous that you cannot do anything but laugh. A lot of what happens is downright vile and inhumane, but it is done with such style and wit, that it just cannot be anything but hilarious. Every obscene and violent action done in previous Rodriguez and Tarantino movies is more than topped here, and fans will be hard set on not wanting some more by the time Death Proof concludes.The faux trailers are also a nice touch, and in a way, push the boundaries of violence and hilarity even more so. I do not want to ruin any of them, but I just could not stop laughing. They are absolutely perfect, and they connect the films even more than they are already (not to mention the old-school ratings and preview reels). Rodriguez's Machete trailer that opens Grindhouse is amazing, and sets the tone for everything that follows. They only further how dedicated the filmmakers were to their original visions, and make the film all the more authentic.The acting is campy, cheesy and right on the mark. Everyone is at their best, no matter how small their role, and no one feels like they are wrong for their part. Rose McGowan is a particular stand-out in both films, delivering every line and action to the highest degree possible. Kurt Russell is another stand-out, playing a character that is so evil that he exhales cool with every breath. And Freddy Rodriguez more than proves that he has what it takes to be a leading man. I did not like one particular character's sudden change half way through their film, but it works for the most part anyway.There is nothing more I can say but that you need to see this film. It may be imperfect and a bit longish, but it is the closest thing to a brilliant homage that any filmmaker or audience has ever seen. It is everything that anyone could have hoped for and more.9.5/10.",9,250,375,4 April 2007
The Artist," A wildly enjoyable dose of cinematic magic
","Looking back at the ride that was this year's TIFF, I continue to find multiple errors in judgment in regards to what I could have seen versus what I did see. While I saw some extraordinary works, I find that I missed out on some truly incredible films. One such loss was The Artist, a decision I regretted immediately afterwards. I have heard nothing but praise since the film's debut at Cannes, and missing out when I had a remote chance was a terrible mistake. Luckily, I only had to wait a short while before getting another chance to see the film. And let me say right from the start, if you have the chance to see this film, do not think twice about missing out.George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is at the pinnacle of his career as a silent film star in late 1920s Hollywood. He is a megastar, beloved by his fans and loathed by his studio. On chance, he literally bumps into Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) and helps get her film career started over night. But as talkies start to take over and Miller's star rises, Valentin's starts to fall. It does not sound like a lot, but the simplicity of The Artist is where the film finds its charm and its wonder. Michel Hazanavicius, a relative unknown on this side of the Atlantic, has composed something truly extraordinary and ridiculously unique by 2011 standards. Who would have thought that creating a silent film would provide one of the most enjoyable experiences you will likely have at the movies all year?Of course, the most widely discussed item regarding the film is its use of silent film tropes and language. This is a silent film about a silent film star. Hazanavicius takes his cues from the pioneers of cinema, and wisely and effortlessly fuses together a film that would not look entirely out of place should it have been shown in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Where filmmakers have been using a widescreen canvas since the 1950s, Hazanavicius stubbornly sticks to the method of the time and displays everything he needs to in the 1.37:1 ratio. I imagine the film would look great in colour, but again, he stays true to the time and gives the film a glorious black and white image that shines brighter than any colour image ever could have. It gives a certain aura of authenticity to the picture that borders on being a gimmick not unlike 3D, but instead allows the film to become all that more special and unique.I must confess that I have watched very few silent films, a hurdle I envision many audience members may face when they see The Artist. But right from the opening frame, Hazanavicius makes it incredibly easy to put those fears to rest. Through the lovingly created and often nostalgia-inducing visuals, I found myself swept up and deeply engrossed in what was happening. While I could read the lips of some actors, I found that you never really needed to in order to get a full grasp of what was being conveyed. It may sound a bit pedantic of me to even consider discussing the semantics of my literal viewing experience, but it is something that demands to be noted. This film is not an easy sell, and its silent nature was initially a little startling of an idea for me. I do not know if Hazanavicius envisioned this problem from the offset, but I cannot imagine the film would be anywhere near as enjoyable had it had sound.While Hazanavicius does deserve a lot of praise for the sheer fact that he made this film, I find an equal if not greater amount of praise should be bestowed on Dujardin. Without letting us hear him say a word, he is simply marvelous from beginning to end. He is a true artist, brilliantly using his emotions at every turn. He hams it up when he needs to, and then goes deeply serious even quicker. He works twice as hard as any actor working today to really make his plight from silent film icon to a distraught and lost has-been truly believable. His actions, whether wholesome fun or downright depressing, are one-of-a- kind, and make us truly appreciate what icons like Charlie Chaplin, Lou Chaney and Harold Lloyd had to go through when they made their films. The expressions on Dujardin's face are simply astounding, and are more than enough reason to see the film, if there were not already more than enough.While Bejo's chemistry with Dujardin is the stuff of magic, I found that she was nowhere near as strong without him. She does some great work, but she never really comes out as a character that I truly believed in. I found that I was watching an actor act her way through a silent film, as opposed to Dujardin whose work simply transcends the medium. It makes for a slight disappointment, but thankfully she shares the screen with him enough times that it makes up for her fumbles on her own. Supporting turns from James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller and especially John Goodman are all above and beyond great, but again, simply pale in comparison to the artistry on display by Dujardin.It may be overly clear already, but rather simply put, The Artist is every bit as good as you have heard and probably even better. There are a few minor elements that simply do not add up, and a bit too much of a lull in the middle act, but this is a really wonderful film unlike any other this year. It is wildly enjoyable from beginning to end, and packs one of the best performances of the year that will leave you astounded. This is the kind of movie magic we see all too rarely. Do not let it pass you by.8.5/10.",8,4,7,29 November 2011
Invictus," Great work from Freeman and the story, but everything else feels average or amateur at best
","While not exactly a biopic per se, Invictus does tell an important piece of Nelson Mandela's (Morgan Freeman) life as President of South Africa. With the country's rugby team losing horribly match after match, he looks to Captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to help unite the team in time for the country's hosting duties of the 1995 World Cup, and in turn, unite a country still reeling from apartheid.Clint Eastwood continues to defy all Hollywood conventions with Invictus, his ninth film of the decade. The man is going on 80, but he is pumping out more movies than heavyweights like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. And with each passing film, he continues to up his craft and his scope for what he is capturing on screen. While Invictus is nowhere near the epic undertaking of the twofer of Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, it still stands as a very accomplished work. But much like Flags, it is a very flawed work.The story itself is fairly well done. It is predictable of course, but is sappy in some wrong places. It is not quite Remember the Titans for adults like I heard it described as, but it borders on feeling much the same way. I find it interesting that the first real story we get about Mandela dramatized on screen is more about rugby than it is about the man, but Eastwood presents it in such a fascinating way that it manages to work as a depiction of him. There is a great reverence on display from the beginning, with actual TV footage digitally manipulated to add in Freeman over the real Mandela, and at every turn, the story stays consistent with these early images. It jumps around in focus between Mandela and Pienaar, but it never feels bothersome and always feels like a well rounded tale. Unfortunately, that tale does not always stay as interesting as it could.But while the story is not bad, the editing is all over the place. After really beginning to hit his stride, Eastwood seems to be falling back and looking more amateur in some of the scenes on display here. Some run too long, others too short. Others are left far too open ended, and some too preachy. Even worse, some scenes have characters fading in and out like ghosts, pushing a heavy handed message about the unfairness of the system too far. Having seen his previous work, it is clear Eastwood knows better than this, so why allow these elements to take away from what could be a fantastic piece of work? The ending rugby match that seems to run on forever has a lengthy period of time where everything runs in slow motion. While this is typical for a sports film, especially for the team playing, Eastwood makes everything run in slow motion: the team, the fans watching in the stadium, the fans at home and at bars, Mandela himself. And it runs for more than five minutes like this, overkilling and destroying any suspense or tension the film has going for it because the audience begins to laugh at how ridiculous the scene looks. It reminded me a lot of what I can only explain as the 'Gatorade' sequence from Spielberg's Munich, where one of the most intense scenes in the film is ruined by a goofy slow motion sequence. It takes you right out of the movie; the last thing any filmmaker wants to see happen.The music fares even worse. While the African inspired songs that play throughout the film are very well used in their sequences, there are a few English-speaking songs that are just wrong for the film. Thankfully Eastwood does not sing any himself (unlike the hilariously bad tune that nearly ruins Gran Torino), but the lyrics are just awful. Again, they took me right out of the film, and made me laugh more than anything. They may help describe what is going on, but in the forms they are given to us, they do nothing but take away from everything. While I was a little disappointed to hear another similar Eastwood score in other cases, the addition of an African influence causes the score to sound all the better and more original. The man can only use a similar score for so many films before it becomes stale, and thankfully it is altered to sound all the more unique.While his accent is not perfect, Freeman delivers another fabulous performance. The man may be ageing as quickly as Eastwood, but his technique never wavers. His soft spoken and generous nature is only complimented by how easily he slips into the character. He has just the right amount of power and gravitas in each scene that it is hard to realize it is not actually Mandela playing himself on screen. It is a very personal performance that is just as inspiring as it looks. It is not the performance of the year, but it comes really close to competing with it.Damon on the other hand, does not fare so well. He just does not come off as believable as the rugby team's Captain. His accent falls somewhere between Freeman's great accent here and Nicole Kidman's horrible attempt at Italian in Nine. But even despite that, his character is just not compelling enough to make us really care about his struggle to help Mandela achieve his goals. When he does make it work, he does well for himself. But those moments come too few and far between.I wanted to like Invictus more than I did. Freeman delivers, and the story is fairly well done as well. But the rest just feels either average or amateur at best. The film is not bad, but it could have been significantly better edited.6.5/10.",6,20,41,17 December 2009
Super 8," A wildly nostalgic and truly spectacular must-see event
","As the marketing and hype started to build for Super 8, I decided to try my best to not watch any real trailers or promos for the film. It was a difficult task, but somehow I managed to pull off allowing the film to be a mystery leading into its release. When I got the opportunity to see the film in advance fell into my lap, I did not second guess the hype – I ran to the theatre as fast as I could. Taking place in the summer of 1979, Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney) is part of an atypical group of friends making a film to enter into a local film festival. While shooting on a train platform late one night, the group witnesses a horrific train crash. They survive the mysterious crash, and do not think much of it. But then strange things begin happening in the town, and the US military suddenly shows up to clean up the damage, not to mention some bizarre things are being recovered from the crash.I already feel like I have said too much regarding about Super 8, but my enthusiasm for this ridiculously well done film is too hard to contain. Abrams, alongside producer and obvious inspiration Steven Spielberg, has crafted something both special and truly extraordinary. What is on the outside a very keenly and nostalgically made film about the loss of innocence and the wonder of personal discovery, is also a period picture examining a time when the slightest enigmatic occurrence could lead to an accusation of Soviet invasion. Many will instantly equate the film to the early work of Spielberg himself (not only because of the various homages), but this is a film that was never meant to draw such easy comparisons.With Super 8, Abrams has matured into a great filmmaker who is very quickly on their way to becoming a master of the craft. He tenderly embraces the format of a monster movie and the hard lessons behind growing up (not unlike Joe Cornish's significantly grittier Attack the Block), and never lets either get too far ahead of itself. While it can be thrilling and fused with electric intensity, it can also be very tender and moving. We know the focus is on these adorable, wide-eyed kids, but Abrams invests enough time into the adult characters like Kyle Chandler's Deputy Jackson Lamb and Louis Dainard, played by the obscenely underrated Ron Eldard as well. By doing this, he allows the audience to follow in the wonder of the children's vague cluelessness of the hell that is going on around them, and the adults trying to unravel the mystery. He also lets the script speak for itself, directing the increasing action brilliantly and allowing the actors to truly become the characters they are playing. I just hope he quickly realizes his stylish use of lens flare is beginning to border a little too close to overbearing.Acting wise, the film fires on all cylinders. Chandler and Eldard are excellent in their fatherly roles, as is Noah Emmerich's absolutely despicable Nelec. But the show is completely stolen far and away by the children. This is really their movie, and they shine in each of their scenes. Casting relative unknowns in the majority of these roles, not least Courtney in the lead, helps give an enhanced sense of authenticity and fascination. The looks of fear, confusion, sadness and fun are real in the most flattering way possible. There is not one instance where any of these kids look like they are acting against a green-screen, or acting on a set. They act like seasoned veterans, and will surprise you consistently from the opening frame right until the end of the credits. Special mention also goes to Elle Fanning, who is rapidly proving to be a formidable talent who might be even stronger than her famous sister Dakota.While I will not give away too many specific details, I can say the special effects should already be considered an early front runner for the best of the year. The train crash sequence involves some of the most incredibly and intensely depicted images of destruction I have ever seen. You will be on the edge of your seat unable to look away from just how amazingly realistic it all looks. With Super 8, the visual effects are taken to the extreme, and look absolutely astounding every time they are employed. Without ruining anything else, I can safely say you will be both terrified and awestruck by just how much effort was put into making these effects look so realistic.If I hold anything against the film, it is the finale. The film is brilliantly paced and the tone is never taken for granted, but it just comes off a bit odd when compared to the rest of the film. It is not as disappointing as some may have you believe, but it was a bit too soft and cuddly for my liking – a little bit too close to what Spielberg would have done. We know the film is a nostalgic homage to those films that so many of us remember watching on weekends as kids, but the ending just does not jive as well as it could have. It feels like Abrams just did not want to commit to anything darker, and just went with the safest route he could think of. If you are still reading this review and can see Super 8 now, than you have made a big mistake. With only his third film, Abrams has made a truly spectacular must-see film that demands to be seen as quickly as possible. Allowing some of the surprises to be spoiled is simply not an option. This is the best film of the summer thus far, and will be remembered well into the end of the year. 9/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",9,26,51,5 June 2011
Up," Imaginative, fun and moving - as close to perfect as Pixar has ever been
","Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone – young 'wilderness explorer' Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.The fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.Coming off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.What makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a 'bird' named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story – the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl's backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.But the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun – something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up's favour.But of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl's facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).I cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.10/10.",10,301,382,29 May 2009
Some Like It Hot," A must-see comic classic
","Some Like it Hot is one of the funnier movies I've seen in a bit, and even though it's been ripped off, parodied and homaged in countless films since, it was still a joy to watch. It's surprisingly violent, and definitely threw me off guard with what to expect. It gave me a good laugh at the looking back at the mob years in 1959, and comparing it to the likes of what we have now.It was great seeing Jack Lemmon grace the screen again, and he rocks the casbah with Tony Curtis. But clearly, Curtis is no Walter Matthau. Monroe though, other than being eye-candy...is totally useless. Seriously, like I know I've never watched a movie of hers before, but she was so totally useless, and didn't deserve being the best credited star. Definitely a weak point of the film.But the direction, the acting, and the slapstick style of the movie is excellent, and is far better than what we have now. I hadn't seen anything by Billy Wilder either, and now feel the need to continue.I love the last line though. Just utter perfection, and makes the film live up to its name in gold.'Well...nobody's perfect.' Just, fantastic. I was giggling for a good 5 minutes after. If you're looking for a bit of a light laugh, and some screwball antics (laced with sexual innuendos that soared right over the 1950s crowd), here's something for you.8.5/10.",8,1,2,7 February 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Has it's moments, but not totally rewarding
","Is there really anyone who has not read The Da Vinci Code? Dan Brown's behemoth best seller was a definite page-turner, and clearly had the makings for a film. So when it was finally announced, there was obvious skepticism over whether it would work as well as the book did. Casting decisions were brought with heavy criticisms, but the hype machine persevered anyway (if anyone had doubts about that, I am certain they did not last). So despite reading the book and not being overly impressed by it (and seeing the film have key moments practically ruined by the trailer), I still decided to give it a shot.The curator has been murdered in the Louvre, and the French Police decide that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), an American symbologist, is the best man to go to in order to find out why. Of course, when Langdon arrives, he finds out that he is totally over his head, and that his symbology skills will become more than handy. What follows is a totally political story, which questions our faith in the knowledge we have, and brings on a whole flurry of new questions for us.Brown's page-turner was fast-paced, and practically flies right through its four hundred plus pages. But as any film fan should know, a good book does not always make for a good film. Ron Howard's film attempts to fly through its one hundred fifty minute runtime, but hits the roadblock of the immense historical elements of the book, and just slows down entirely about halfway through the film. And as it tries to recover, you realize that it just does not have the same charm as the book did. The book had flashbacks, it had motivations, it had emotions, it had everything you could expect from a good writer. It was practically written like a screenplay. So then, why did Akiva Goldsman find the influence to cut those things out, and allow the film to only make total sense to the book readers (while changing other things around, taking things out and adding in comic relief)? It totally takes away from the overall impact that the book had, and the film suffers as a result. When the interesting parts come, they just do not have the same thrill, or just come off as totally uninteresting.Howard does make a valiant attempt at staying true to the book though, even with the changes. The editing in of Langdon's puzzle solving work helps the audience better understand his thinking, and the footage used to show off the historical events is pretty well done as well (except for when they try to seamlessly edit it over the modern day, with Hanks and Audrey Tautou walking through it). But while that may work sparingly, the entirety of the soundtrack quite simply, does not. The songs seem out of sync, as if someone edited them into the film at the wrong frames. The volume loudens at the wrong moments, and goes quiet at the even more wrong moments. It seems totally misplaced throughout the film, and lessens the film even more so.Hanks was the wrong choice from the start, and he shows it with his lackluster performance. It is nowhere near as good as the majority of his work, and he just does not seem to be enjoying himself. Tautou, the female lead, does not fare much better, but at least she puts some work into her performance. Unfortunately, like in the book, these two characters are the most seen, so excellent supporting character work from Jean Reno, Alfred Molina and Paul Bettany falls to the wayside. In fact, Bettany's role as Silas is the most underrated here, because he has nowhere near as much to work with as he would have if his character was adapted a whole lot better. On the other hand, Ian McKellan is fabulous in his role, and shows up anyone he's on-screen with at all times. The passion he has in this role almost makes me want to forgive Howard for even bothering to give Hanks a shot at this.The film has it's moments, but is ultimately unrewarding to book fans. Some things work, but many do not. The film feels rushed, and feels like it needed much more time to be developed. Brown's book was not disappearing off the best seller list, so why the need to rush out the movie? With time, and a few choice changes, this film could have met the same raving success that the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter films met. But unfortunately, it falls short of any expectations. Even without reading the book, you may find some enjoyment out of it. Just don't expect it to feel totally complete.7/10.",7,0,2,7 June 2006
Thor," Has the potential to be great, but never really gets the chance to achieve
","When Marvel announced its intentions to create a film based on The Avengers, most fanboys cheered with delight. I remain to be incredibly interested in what the company and Joss Whedon have in store for us next summer, but in the interim we have Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to look forward to. While every new image and trailer has kept me excited for Cap's entrance, I have always remained skeptical on Thor. The trailers did nothing to help my hesitation going into the film, and after watching it, I am even more apprehensive Marvel's future plans.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a ridiculously powerful god living in the 'realm' of Asgard. He is due to be crowned king by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), but during his commencement, Asgard is briefly invaded by rogue members of the Frost Giants, a group who hold a long standing truce with Asgard. After acting out recklessly and endangering the lives of his warrior companions, Odin strips Thor of his godly powers and his hammer Mjolnir and exiles him to Earth. As he searches for hammer, Thor ends up in the care of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), a scientist studying wormholes, constellations and the causes for certain spatial phenomena.I find it incredibly difficult to go even further trying to describe Thor. The ending is ridiculously obvious moments after the film begins, and the proceeding moments make no attempt at trying to do something outside of playing by-the-numbers. Origins are vaguely discussed, and there is such little emphasis on character development and explanation that you wonder why Marvel even bothered giving the character his own film in the first place. The best part of the film is the initial introduction to Thor, Asgard and the powers possessed by these godly warriors. Everything past his exile feels secondary and almost useless.One of these reasons is the simple fact that Thor's journey on Earth is not interesting in the slightest. It is the battles, the characters, the settings on Asgard that offer the most fascinating, engaging and enjoyable scenes in the entire film. The film has a habit of jumping back and forth between what is occurring on Asgard as Thor treks on Earth. Almost every time, I found myself more focused watching those scenes that keep jumping in, and was ridiculously bored by everything else. I figured these scenes would be the most satisfying parts of the film, but never figured they would make me totally oblivious of everything else that was happening.But I digress, because it seems like the plotting and story existed only because Marvel needed some time to show Thor off to anyone who does read comics on a regular basis. He is the character with the most 'development' in the film and his role in the film is defined merely to tease how he comes on S.H.E.I.L.D.'s radar and becomes a part of The Avengers. Hell, they even go so far to only give us small dialogue exchanges, a few nods and two awesome cameos as they build towards that film (unlike Iron Man 2, whose second half revolves almost entirely around increasing audience awareness), and spend the rest of the time trying to tell us who Thor is. I appreciated less emphasis on Avenger lore, but considering Thor is not an incredibly exciting character, that appreciation can only go so far. Special effects wise, the film is a mixed bag. Many of the scenes on Asgard are simply astounding to watch. They are truly breathtaking, and provide one of the only reasons anyone should bother watching the film. But a lot of the fight scenes are the exact opposite. They move too fast, are hard to see, and are almost cartoonish in nature. I know Thor and his warrior compatriots exist in a place of pure fantasy, but that does not mean everything has to look so preposterous. The 3D adds to a few of these scenes and makes them infinitely more impressive. But at the same time, it also helps mask how terribly composed a lot of them are as well. Hemsworth as Thor is one of the other small amount of reasons to see the film. He is built like a tank, and has a powerful aura about himself. He easily embodies the character's superhuman abilities with ease, and makes something as silly as waving a hammer look ridiculously bad-ass. He transcends the role, and stays strong throughout, whether playing the character as an arrogant and pompous warrior, or a meek and mostly powerless stranger. He has a lot of fun with the role, but he never forsakes or even attempts to not take the role deadly serious. Sadly, much like the interchangeable story, the majority of the supporting cast simply does not match up to the power of Hemsworth's performance. Portman, fresh off her Oscar win, is supposed to be a brilliant scientist. But one look at Thor, and she is thrown into a giggling schoolgirl like trance that she is unable to shake for the entire film. Stellan Skarsgård is decent, but he does nothing outside of answer a few questions and hint at future developments. Kat Dennings exists solely for comedic purposes. Hopkins and Idris Elba are two stand outs, but they are so horrendously underplayed that it is practically criminal. I was actually really impressed by Tom Hiddleston's performance as Thor's brother Loki and Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson of S.H.E.I.L.D. But sadly, they can only do so much in light of being overshadowed. While there is quite a bit to enjoy about Thor, there is way too much to dislike. It had potential to be something great even with what it has working against it, but it sadly just never makes anything for itself. It exists merely to help Marvel fit an agenda. And Kenneth Branagh seriously directed this? You could have fooled me.6/10.",6,15,34,30 April 2011
The Happening," If only the script could have reflected Shyamalan's great ideas and imagination
","M. Night Shyamalan has a habit of making movies that look and sound genuinely interesting. The man clearly has an immense imagination, and it shows in the content he produces. But after the disappointment of The Village and the absolutely terrible Lady in the Water, I think I was one of the few that still held out hope for The Happening.For good reason too.As the title and promos suggest, The Happening revolves around an 'event' that is making people in certain states in the US commit suicide. Originally pegged as the work of biological terrorists, everyone in the top most Eastern states attempts to flee, but the threat continues to wreck havoc on the populous. The film focuses on the plight of Elliot (Mark Wahlberg) and Alma (Zooey Deschanel) Moore, who are attempting to get out of Philadelphia with the daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), of one of their friends.Intriguingly, Shyamalan starts the film right off with the event beginning to take place in New York City, and barely breaks pace to breathe from there. Much like Cloverfield, this is a movie about running and survival. We are barely introduced to Elliot and Alma before they find out about what is going on, and attempt to leave Philadelphia. He leaves very little time to get to know anyone the two encounter (much less the pair themselves), and spend more time on how they are avoiding what looks like an inevitable death. And in this respect (minus some really bogged down exposition near the final third of the film), Shyamalan manages to recreate the breakneck thriller style we knew him for back when he was first starting out (so basically everything pre-Village).He is also very effect in his use of violence. It is never too gruesome, but it is fairly graphic nonetheless. The film was advertised heavily as his first attempt at an R-rating, and he uses this minor hindrance to his advantage. But instead of being in-your-face about the violence, he builds up to it, hitting us with graphic images for only a few minor seconds (as opposed to the near pornographic depictions in 'thrillers' like Saw IV and Hostel). He teases and shows only what he needs to, and then throws up the rest quickly in the cases that need it. And when he is not being ridiculous with his death sequences, it looks like he is making a genuine attempt at scaring the audience.But unfortunately for Shyamalan, this is not the movie that will deliver him out of the rut he is in. If anything, he just made the hole a touch bigger.For one thing, the storyline becomes ludicrously bad after the devastating effects begin to become apparent. It just seems like he cooked up the idea for the story, wrote an amazing opening, and then had no idea what to do afterwards. Everything that comes after the initial set-up either feels half baked, or feels haphazardly thrown together at the last minute. There is little commitment to these scenes, and there is even less in the cohesiveness of the story. The film is not long at all (and practically flies through its running time), but it feels like a lot of loose ideas Shyamalan had super-glued together in his script, than it does something he actually spent real time working on. I admire and like the reasoning behind the attacks, but Shyamalan only has the idea on display here, not the real workings of it.Laughably bad death scenes aside, Shyamalan also needs to work on his dialogue. The Happening is nowhere near as dialogue heavy as any of his other scripts, and as a result, leaves a lot of room for error. I know that Wahlberg is a decent actor capable of greatness. But here, his character is worse than one-dimensional. Yes, we have the pathos for his character built up in nearly every scene, but his dialogue does not sound like that of any human being I have ever met in my life. If I am being faced with a life-altering decision, I doubt I would ever just say 'Oh no', and not really mean it. If the audience is laughing at what your characters are saying, instead of being terrified of what may or may not be coming for them, something is most definitely wrong.We know, at the very least, that Shyamalan can write decent dialogue. The man was not nominated for a writing Oscar simply based off the crazy ending people still talk about. So what happened here? Did he really set out to write the most wooden dialogue of the year? Did the studio really push him into the project based solely off the main idea that is expressed with the first ten minutes? Valid questions yes, but ones that will never be answered by the man himself.Acting wise, the movie is nearly unwatchable. Wahlberg and Deschanel are the essence of mismatched pair, and not once is their relationship believable. I realize that some of their subplot involves the troubles they are having in their marriage, but it does not explain the fact that they never show any real desire for having liked each other in the first place. Sadly, Deschanel fairs even worse than Wahlberg's cardboard acting. I really liked some of her previous work, but here she looks confused for the majority of the film, and completely out of it for the rest.The supporting cast is not much better. Sanchez does not even bother making an attempt at trying to look desperate, John Leguizamo gets next to no time to develop anything, and Betty Buckley's character is just too quirky for words.The Happening has some great ideas, but no foundations to do anything with them. Shyamalan has the ability to make something of his movies, why not use it instead of giving us this half-baked garbage? 3.5/10.",3,2,6,17 June 2008
The Fountain," Visually astounding, but far too flawed to be looked at as anything more
","After seeing the brilliance he delivered in Requiem for a Dream last summer, I was up for anything Darren Aronofsky had to offer. I never had a chance to view his first film, Pi, but I did want to make a point of seeing The Fountain as soon as I could. And despite the heavily negative reviews I read, I figured it had to be somewhat worthwhile.So as anyone who has read anything on this film can tell you, The Fountain cycles through a thousand year cycle of a man named Tom (Hugh Jackman), and the love of his life, Isabel (Rachel Weisz), and his search for everlasting life. In 1500, he is a Spanish conquistador, searching for a tree that will keep his queen alive forever. In 2000, he is a lab scientist trying to find a cure for his ailing wife. In 2500, he is a cosmonaut, traveling through space with a tree, haunted by old memories.While the film is undeniably unique and original, it often played itself out to look like a movie that was originally envisioned to be so much grander. It really does feel like Aronofsky made a compromise and took out the real lavishness of the film, and just left the bare bones. Not that the powerful and deep seated core of the movie is not there, it just feels like that is it, and nothing more.While this would not usually sound like a bad thing, it proves to be one here. Whole sequences go on for minutes at a time, and they just point to something that is either not there, or not worthy of retrieving. Every moment in the film is interconnected (hence why some are overplayed quite annoyingly), but every moment does not feel like it is needed. It just turns boring really quickly, and leads to a lot of eye-rolling as the movie barrels on. And for a movie that is just over ninety minutes, that just does not work. While editing probably would not have solved this, more coherency in these redundant sequences probably would have helped.And while the film is fairly easy to follow at first (despite the jumpiness between time periods and its numerous allusions to everything from the bible to medieval times), it completely turns itself on its own head during its denouement. I expected my mind to get screwed with, but it just did not seem to make a whole total whack of sense the way Aronofsky did it. It seemed more like he wanted to play out every idea he has, and just throw it at the audience all at once and yell 'Gotcha!' My mind hurts even now, just attempting to comprehend the ultimate point of The Fountain. Was it all an exercise to toy with me, or did Aronofsky genuinely believe he delivered the film he set out to originally? If the whole film did anything for me, it is the fact that I am now curious to see what the original vision was, and if it was just as buggy as this one.What the film also loses in a lot of cases is emotion from the cast. The entire supporting cast looks like they are either watching a train wreck or just seem completely confused at why they are even there throughout the entirety of the film. None of them are particularly notable, and most are seen for fleeting minutes, if at all (and the majority are only used in the events that take place in 2000).Jackman seems like he is really trying, but only makes it work half the time. You can see the pain in his face and in his actions, but when brilliant ideas that make the film progress occur, he just does not seem too phased by what has hit him. He looks just like the script reader told him that something big just happened, and he just runs along and goes with the flow. He is lifeless for the majority of the film, and when his poignant moments come, you stare in agony just wishing that he was not so stiff delivering it. Weisz fares even worse. Despite being the key to the entire production, she goes totally underused. I never got a real sense of why Jackman was moved to keep her alive in any of the scenarios, and got even less a sense as to what she brought to the film besides being the reason for the search. She is good for what she does, but her character does not feel complete. I can only hope this too, was something that got cut.The film succeeds however, in astonishingly detailed style, in its set design and visual effects. They are just totally awe-inspiring, and so totally unique. It is quite the trip, and it never lets up in any case. The colours used are just totally out of this world. Every single visual spec is more than a treat for the audience. It guides them through this totally flawed movie, and is visually appetizing. If I continued watching for any reason (or recommended this to anyone), it was because of just how much effort was obviously used in bringing Aronofsky's vision to life. He clearly is very vivid and imaginative, and his film benefits as a result. It all feels so fluid and so real, even at its most overt-the-top moments. It really breathes life into how biblically and epically laden the film is, and suggests just how much greater it could have been if it was shown in its originally conceived form.Although it is heavily flawed, The Fountain works as a beautiful case of visual direction. Aronofsky clearly was far too ambitious with this third project of his. If he dug a little deeper into his original screenplay, I think he could have made this compromise a whole lot more watchable than it is.6.5/10.",6,0,1,19 May 2007
Zombieland," Entertaining but ultimately disappointing, and nowhere near as great as Shaun of the Dead
","Touted as an American version of Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland follows Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), and sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) as they fight and drive across the United States, avoiding becoming the next statistic of an all encompassing zombie infection. For those wondering, to avoid any real connections to each other, the group goes by city names to avoid exchanging their real names. An interesting touch in an otherwise bafflingly disappointing film.I wanted to love Zombieland the same way I do Shaun, but sadly, the film fails to deliver the same way that low budget British rom-zom-com did five years ago. It has the intentions to be an amazingly hilarious horror film, but it never delivers on the promises of the hysterical trailers.Speaking of those trailers, they are the biggest point of contention I have with the film. They reveal almost every single one of the best jokes. Outside of the crazily hilarious and out-of-this-world cameo appearance, the trailers show and tell almost everything else. And if you have had the misfortune of learning which actor appears in that cameo, half the joke has been ruined already. It feels a bit mismanaged on Sony's part, especially for such a ridiculously short film (80-minutes and change), to basically give away all the best parts. It is something that a lot of studios have tended to not really do so much anymore, but here it just feels silly. A lot of these lines were laugh-out-loud hysterical the first time, but on the second round, seem not so clever or unique. Many of the lines suffer even worse fates. They simply lose their luster, and end up being not funny at all.The film also lacks what is key for every good film involving zombies: satire. George A. Romero became famous for his zombie films, but only because of the ulterior messages he was using the flesh hungry horrors to put across. Isolation and fear were always apparent in his films, and every film from Shaun to the incredibly overrated 28 Days Later has used some part of his famous works to make their own film shine all the brighter. Zombieland does away with this almost entirely. It wisely does not elaborate to in-depth on the cause of the infection, or even how far it reaches (is it just in the United States, or has the whole world become zombies?). But outside of Columbus' rules to live by, which comically appear every few minutes during his narrative speeches, the film never makes an attempt at satirizing anything. It just makes jokes at the expense of pop culture, the cameo actors previous films (good and horrible), and Harrelson's bizarre redneck attitude. Any attempts at drama fall flat on its face.The film also suffers from having an episodic feel. I found it strange how the film seems to take place almost blatantly in acts; sticking to one conflict, subplot or setting at once, and never moving out of it. Learning that the film was supposed to be a television series helps shed light on why it felt this way, but does not explain why the filmmakers did not attempt to jazz it up with more scenes in more places. It gives the film a great low-budgeted feel, and makes it feel more authentic and diverse. But after seeing what a group of amateur South Africans did with 30-million dollars in District 9, I have come to expect a bit more of low budget film-making. Even Shaun manages to do a whole lot more, and from my understanding, it was made for a fairly smaller amount of money as well. The problems Zombieland suffers from here could have only been amended in editing. But with how straight and to the point the film tends to be, I doubt there was any room for added filler at any point (outside of a very dry section taking place shortly after the two groups meet for the first time).The inventive camera angles and consistently dystopic feel are the most powerful points in the film. While the entire film is not made of crazy and unique camera angles, there are plenty that feel original or used far too often. They give a certain taste to the film that makes it much better than it actually is, but do tend to make the film all the more uncommon. The hard rocking soundtrack is pretty well done as well, setting the tone for the film right from Metallica's opening note over the hugely entertaining opening credits.Eisenberg, while saddled with playing almost entirely the same character as he does in Adventureland, does some fairly good work here. His narration adds a comical element to the film that would have been sorrowly missed, and even with his same-note performance, he manages to be convincing in the role. Branching out and doing more unique things with the character could have only been beneficial to him. Harrelson, much accustomed to playing silly and unhinged characters, is solid throughout the film. He has enough finesse and charisma to work off his much younger supporting cast, and manages to make his role fun from beginning to end. Seeing him in roles like this begs the question of why he has not been playing and sticking to characters like these at all times. Stone and Breslin do some decent work in their roles, but are never really explained like Eisenberg and Harrelson are. Their one-dimensionality is a bit silly in the long run (especially when looking at their actions in the final act), but both actresses are convincing in their roles.Saying Zombieland was anything like Shaun of the Dead was the first mistake anyone made with this film. It is a fairly competent film in its own right with good performances, but nowhere near the classic Shaun is and will always be.6.5/10.",6,5,12,8 October 2009
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Funnier than I imagined, but way too random and ridiculously unbalanced
","I randomly entered a draw for free tickets to see Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny, and after winning, was unsure of what to do. I was sure I was not going to like the movie as I was never a big fan of the band, and am fairly indifferent to the work of Jack Black. But I went anyway, if for any reason, just sheerly for fun. And what I got was a fair mix of bad and good, but I was most definitely surprised at both how the film was so much better than I expected, and just how terribly random it is.After a short musical interlude about the sad and rock-impaired childhood of JB (Troy Gentile, the spitting image of Black) followed by a kickin' credits sequence, we move onto him as an adult (now Black himself) and his meeting with Kyle Gass (as himself). He had wanted to become part of a group, and is instantly attracted to Gass as a fellow band mate. Gass is reluctant at first to do anything, but after witnessing a chance encounter where Black is beat up by a gang straight out of A Clockwork Orange, he takes him under his wing and lies to him about being a major player in the music business. Eventually Black finds out the truth, but decides against making his new friend hit the road.I have already said too much, but suffice to say that the newly formed band needs to create their 'masterpiece' and sets out to acquire the 'Pick of Destiny' in order to do it.The film stays on course for the most part with a healthy dose of humour and musical interludes. Other than one scene, every song used is from the band, and plays along excellently alongside the film (of course, the lyrics tend to also be about the certain scene, but their elaborateness really makes for an excellent combination). But while it does stay on course, it does feel unbalanced. In some instances, everything that is said or done is just hilarious specifically for the fact that it is so ridiculously random. But in others, the randomness really just ruins the audience's suspension of disbelief, and just becomes downright stupid.I do not think I have ever seen such a random film in my life, and while some of it feels very well thought out (Black, Gass and director Liam Lynch wrote the screenplay), other parts just feel thrown together and out of place. It is obvious that the film knows its genre (very broad comedy), and knows its ideal audience (fans of the band and Black, and of course stoners), but almost wants to steer onlookers away by throwing in these atrocious and awful scenes. Yes, a lot of them make for smirks and a few broad laughs, but mostly out of the fact that they just do not feel right here. It knows exactly what it wants to be, and in a way that is great. But in another, it really segregates the audience, and makes for anyone not feeling the jokes to feel completely awkward while everyone else laughs. The whole film works on this good and bad principle as a give-and-take type of thing, and sadly never attempts to move away from it.Black and Gass work off of each other quite well, and make for an interesting pair. Black clearly steals the show away, as he actually knows what he's doing when he is not standing beside Gass, whereas Gass seems very confused without Black. I realize that Black is the popular comedic personality, but despite all the jokes and laughs he delivers, Gass just seems DOA without him. They have a solid chemistry, but Gass just cannot do it on his own. The music is also a big highlight, as it is both vulgarly original and disgusting vile all at once. It is a bit hard to take in some instances, and in others just feels like total overkill. But for the most part, it works, and adds a very distinct extra layer to the film. As a sidenote, I do not think I have ever heard the word for male innuendo that starts with the letter 'c' used so frequently like I did here. It is clever at first, but just becomes annoying after a while.Going along with the randomness is the cameos. Meat Loaf, Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller are just a few of the recognizable faces that show up here, and they help add to just how wild the film becomes. All of them play ridiculously over-the-top one-dimensional characters, but there is something to be said for how frequently they pop up and how funny their small amounts of time are on screen. And really, what is Robbins doing here? He did the same thing in Anchorman, so I really am beginning to be a little curious as to his random presence, especially so fresh off of his Oscar win.Another interesting thing is the subtitles and animation that pops up to show the various transitions (and of course, the history of the Pick or 'POD' as they call it). This same style is used during the credit sequence to great effect, and it looks pretty good during the film too. It works well, and feels seamlessly branched right into the film without problem.For the most part, the long-awaited Tenacious D film is a lot better than one would expect. Yeah, it is ridiculous and so terribly random, but it does have a few genuinely funny moments too. Just do feel forewarned that not everyone will enjoy it.6/10.",6,5,10,18 November 2006
The Departed," Another excellent addition to the ever-growing cannon of Scorsese films
","By far, I think Martin Scorsese is my favourite film director. He has a solid film resume under his belt, and despite losing all five of his Best Director Oscar nominations, continues to pump out movies. When his movies are good, they are usually absolutely fantastic. When his movies are bad, even then they still have some form of redeeming quality saving it from full ostracizing. And while I was a bit apprehensive about him doing a remake of the Asian film Infernal Affairs, I have now realized that I was wrong. The Departed brings Scorsese back to his roots on the mean streets, and back to what he does best.The Departed (named after what people are commonly referred to after passing on) chronicles the stories of two Boston police officers, both involved in the continued case to apprehend infamous mobster, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). One is Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), a kid with a not-so-great family history who goes undercover within Costello's group soon after graduation. The other, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is a member of Costello's group undercover within the police department, quickly moving up the ranks. Costigan and Sullivan do not know each other, but as the film heats up, both began seeking out the other.The film is just about phenomenal. I went in with high expectations, and came out totally and utterly impressed.I refused to watch Affairs on principle of being so hyped for this film, and to a point, I think this helped. I knew some basic outlines and ideas of what happened in the original version, but as they played out on screen here, they look just as astonishing as I could imagine. The film is downright intense during many sequences. The cinematography and editing is seamless and absolutely awestriking. There were a few obvious nodes to his older works, but for the most part, is generally what we have come to expect from Scorsese and his films. As well, the writing is sharp and extremely strong. You may find yourself laughing hysterically at a few of the things people say, but you will also sit in fear of these people. Everyone here is a bad, yet highly realistic person. So when one of these characters makes some great jokes, you will be conflicted as to the proper reaction to give.I had no problem with Gangs of New York or The Aviator, but you could tell that Scorsese was having a bit of trouble with the ambitious projects. Seeing him here, back in the same style of film as the likes of Goodfellas and Mean Streets, just brought a smile to my face after watching the entire film. You can tell the precise touches of a Scorsese film from miles away, and this film is no exception. He brings a fine art out of these dark streets like no one else can. And of course, he has the most perfect music selection of any Hollywood director currently alive and employed. He uses them to make his undeniably brilliant and memorable moments all that much better, and as per always, he succeeds.DiCaprio and Damon are excellent in their roles (albeit it took a little bit before I was very trusting of either of their accents). Their slow deterioration and the fear slowly creeping in on them is an absolutely pleasure to watch. While DiCaprio gets a lot more screen time and is fleshed out more, Damon is definitely the better actor, and had the better performance. These two are believable and frightening all at once. As the film keeps moving and you get more of a sense of who these guys really are, these feelings only continue to progress. Nicholson is in top form here. He chews up scenery left and right, and practically steals the carpet right out from the other two. While I saw shades of The Joker in his performance, this is still one of those essentially totally evil acting roles. You cannot help but be scared by this guy, and seeing such a masterful actor in such a great director's hands, is just too memorable of an idea to miss.The supporting cast, which includes Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, Anthony Anderson and Vera Farmiga are all superb in their small roles. None of them can even hold a candle to the other three, but their valiant try cannot go unrewarded. Farmiga and Wahlberg are particular standouts, which didn't not surprise me at all granted his newer material. They are a strong ensemble, and they bring out the great movie watching style even more.If there were anything wrong with the film, it would be the pace of it all. Everyone is on the ball (even through blood-saturated death sequences), but the editing is not completely. At some points, particularly the first hour and the last thirty minutes, the film just whizzes right by. But in others, the film just slows right down. It makes the film feel totally uneven. Some exposition scenes just go a bit too long, and others are just straight and right to the point. I know that the film relies on all the exposition (and the graphic violence, which never lets up), but some of it just felt forced and a bit awkward. They make the film seem a whole lot longer than it really is. It is only a small quibble in an otherwise fantastic film, but still worthy of mention.On the whole, The Departed is one hell of a movie. Packed with strong performances and a great story, this is another excellent addition to the ever-growing cannon of Scorsese films. It obviously is not as good as some of those films, but it makes an astonishing contribution to the library. I can only hope it is recognized at Oscar time for how memorable a film it is.9.5/10.",9,2,5,7 October 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A lackluster sequel that disappoints on almost everything
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is this year's version of The Dark Knight: the big summer sequel that everyone knows and feels the need to see. Undoubtedly, with the possible exception of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the enigmatic and potential game-changer Avatar, Transformers will be this year's highest grossing film. But looking past these two similarities (and a handful of scenes filmed to take advantage IMAX screens), Transformers and Dark Knight have absolutely nothing else in common. While Dark Knight was a masterpiece and is one of the greatest sequels ever made, Transformers just may be one of the worst.Taking the old adage of bigger is better; Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen revolves around the continuing battle between the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Once again, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is thrust into the middle of the war after he accidentally finds a shard from the AllSpark that was destroyed in the first film. The resulting pulse the shard gives off gets the attention of the surviving Decepticons, as does Sam's weird habit of writing ancient messages that is read mainly by Transformers. And that is where the titular character of The Fallen, the leader of the Decepticons, comes in as he wants to kidnap Sam to use as bait against Optimus Prime.Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a busy film that is filled to the brim with ideas and subplots. Virtually everyone in the film has their own storyline and it makes for a movie that has just too much going on. For one thing, it introduces plenty of new Autobots and Decepticons, but the majority is either killed, or does one thing in the film and then is never seen again. They barely even get the time to say one line. New additions to the human cast like Ramon Rodriguez as the conspiracy theorist Leo Spitz, Isabel Lucas' alluring college bombshell Alice and John Benjamin Hickey's punching bag of a government agent Galloway, get very little backstory and are taken out of the film almost as fast as the robots are getting killed. But even the returning cast members (read: practically the entirety of the cast from the original film) get so very little to do that one wonders why they even bothered coming back in the first place.Because the film is so busy, and Michael Bay seems so intent on filling his explosion and action scene quota to quadruple the size of scenes of exposition and explanation, the film virtually moves from point to point on a whim. A character is introduced late in the film merely to explain everything that has happened, and everything that will happen. He has no development; he is merely a plot device. So very little is explained that it gets to the point where things just happen for no reason, and then the audience is given all of a minute to digest what just happened. Characters die, yet no one seems to really mourn for them. They just pick up and soldier on to the ending. And then when scenes actually do become emotional, they get so melodramatic that you wish there was no focus on them.There just seems to be no middle ground in the film. Characters, no matter if they are main or supporting, are saddled with horrible or non-existent lines. I realize the film was cobbled and stitched together during the Writer's Strike, but two of the three credited writers are coming off the excellent redo of Star Trek, which ironically was made by the same company as Transformers. But it was affected by the strike too. How can one film be littered with such a wealth of thought out exposition, while the other is basically hobbled by almost none? But what mangles this film even further is the insistence on being funny. The first film had a bizarre sense of humour that got in the way more than once, but this film is just so over-the-top ridiculous in some scenes that it almost becomes parody. John Turturro is brought back simply to be zany and off kilter and the Autobot 'twins' Skids and Mudflap are so overtly annoying in their quest to be comic relief that they make Jar Jar Binks look like Brando in The Godfather. But these two examples are just the tip of how much 'funny' is added into the film. Sex jokes and innuendos are tossed at random (including a scene where a small Decepticon humps Megan Fox's leg), an entirely needless scene with Sam's mom Judy (Julie White) eating 'green brownies' becomes the focal point of an entire scene, as does a scene involving LaBeouf's odd screaming like a girl. Some of the laughs are genuinely funny, but the majority either fall flat or are totally out-of-place.What is done right, again, are the incredible special effects. It is still amazing to watch these Autobots and Decepticons face off against each other, and even more so when the newer, larger Transformers come into the fold. The entire opening chase scene in Shanghai is simply marvelous to watch (and such a downer by the end since nothing matches up to it at all). Some of the scenes looked incredibly fake however, especially scenes involving human and robot interaction. Not all of these scenes look the same, but it still makes for a bit more added disappointment.If you go into Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen hoping for anything outside of awesome effects, just do not even bother. It may look great, and have amazing effects, but the lack of a cohesive plot, too many characters, and its inane humour is so horribly done that you may insist on getting your money back. So little is done right that I genuinely fear for Transformers III.4/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",4,5,13,1 July 2009
The Holiday," Has its share of problems, but is great for a light laugh
","I am a sucker for romantic comedies. I have always enjoyed watching them, no matter how cliché-ridden or awful they are. So when The Holiday was announced, I was immediately intrigued. Kate Winslet and Jack Black in a romantic comedy? Cameron Diaz doing a comedy that looked mature, and not raunchy or animated? It spoke to me as something that could have been different. And while it partially was, it still was inherently just as clichéd as romantic comedies always have been.Amanda (Diaz) and Iris (Winslet) are alone for the holidays. Having just gotten over some devastating news regarding the men in their lives, they meet by chance on an online house swapping website. The two instantly bond, and decide to swap their homes, despite Amanda living in Los Angeles and Iris living outside of London. And despite going on vacations to stay away from love, they end up developing romantic relationships anyway.Even without mentioning the Jude Law or Black in the synopsis, I am absolutely certain everyone can tell what is to come when they begin watching the movie. It is very much in tune with being a romantic comedy, and only vaguely pretends to not be at certain points. For some odd reason however, it runs over two hours. It easily could get chopped down a bit (leaving out a lot of the idiosyncratic tendencies of the two women), and would feel a bit tighter than it is (although I did enjoy the little trailer moments that show up from time to time).The story, as ridiculous as the set-up sounds, is sweet and packs in a few really great character moments. Unfortunately, it also adds in a lot of subplots that seem a little random. The entire friendship between Iris and the elderly screenwriter Arthur (Eli Wallach) feels more like filler than anything else. Hell, it does not even make for the entire reason she and Black's character Miles meet in the first place. So as tender and poignant some of the moments between Iris and Arthur are, they feel a bit out of place for what is supposed to be the main focus of her plot line (as convoluted as it is).But even with its problems, Winslet delivers a fine performance. Switching between being totally depressed and as happy as can be, she brings a certain authenticity to her role that is usually completely non-existent in female rom-com leads. Coming from a background of fairly dramatic roles, she truly blossoms as the haplessly confused Iris. The majority of genuine character moments are given by her, and the real likability of the film rests solely with her. I was really absorbed by her moments on screen, and I could only wish that she would make more movies like this (or was the main character in the story).Sadly, the lead is Diaz, and she fares quite badly. Until her and Law's characters are developed beyond the limits of what the trailer shows, she is basically playing a caricature of herself. Not showing any depth or wanton desire to excel in any of these early moments, Diaz just kind of wanders around, seemingly acting as if she was living her day-to-day life. Now, I know I do not know Ms. Diaz personally, but from anything anyone has ever read, seen or heard about her, this would probably be a spot-on re-enactment. Could it be that this role was written so well and so close to Diaz that it is easy to see no difference between her and the character she is playing? Maybe. But if your likability starts off low, I cannot imagine that is the intended reaction.When she finally does come out of her shell and begin to at least look like she is acting, she still does not hold a candle to Winslet. She just does not seem nearly as strong, and is overshadowed in every way by her. Yes, she does give a few intentional laughs and acts adequately, but when paired off against someone with such a more unique and eloquent thespian style, one can truly see how mismatched and ordinary her acting talent is. It is not that she is a bad actor, she just does not seem to have what it takes to overcome the pitfalls of a role like this. If she does not begin picking up soon, I can only imagine that this is going to be the standard film she will be acting in exclusively (like her Charlie's Angels pal Drew Barrymore).The guys fare about the same. Law seems a bit confused for much of the film, not giving his usual intense and charismatic all for this character. Like Diaz, he does rise to the occasion a handful of times, but he just does not seem to be all there. He is the most enigmatic of all of the characters, and it shows in how loose and unconcerned his character is most of the time. Black on the other hand, delivers in spades. I was impressed with his astonishing range in King Kong, and again, he does not disappoint here. He clearly does not have to grasp as far, but his usual zaniness is curbed to a minimum, and it allows for him to really pull off a good performance. This is the stuff of a guy who does not just want to be known just as a bizarre joker.Small turns from Edward Burns and Rufus Sewell come off as a bit forced (especially Sewell), but they add a bit of depth to the movie that is usually missing. Wallach, as random as his plot line is, does great for the limited role that he has.It may not be a monumentally original achievement, but The Holiday is an enjoyable romantic comedy. It is better than most, and is great for a light laugh or two.7/10.",7,2,3,27 May 2007
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Teens will appreciate it, but it is doubtful anyone else will
","Nick (Michael Cera) is a bit of a mope, being freshly dumped by the girl of his dreams, Tris (Alexis Dziena), and is the only straight guy in an all gay band called 'The Jerkoffs'. Norah (Kat Dennings) is one of those lonely souls, searching for the right person and pines after the Tris' stalkerish ex, who she has never met. By chance, they meet at a club the band is playing at, and then begin a night's adventure searching for a secret concert being put on by their favourite band, Where's Fluffy.It may not sound like much on paper, but after seeing the trailer for Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, I was kind of hoping for something that would be more than your typical teen flick. And with Cera coming fresh off Superbad and Juno, I could have only hoped that my own hopes would not go unanswered.Of course, I may have been expecting too much. From the moment the movie starts, it is clearly aiming itself directly for a young teen audience. Yes, the whole idea of being able to search for this mythical band until all hours of the night seems like a bit of a stretch for a normal teen with curfews, but the immature and inexperienced attitude it took about relationships, life and hard drinking seem heavily seated in the realm of a young teenager's fantasies. This is the type of movie I would have been hard pressed to not have enjoyed five or ten years ago, and I imagine most young people feel the same way.But looking at it as an adult, the film only makes me feel older. It has a very nostalgic aura about it, and a type of innocence that only a person in high school could appreciate. It lacks the real world implications of Juno (or even Dennings' own turn in The 40-Year-Old Virgin), and lacks the all around appeal of Superbad, or even seminal teen flicks like The Breakfast Club or Rebel Without a Cause. So how can one who has experienced the life of a teen, appreciate it when they have moved past that stage in life? Should it not have even made a sheer attempt at being able to be accessed by more than one demographic? One problem it has is a lack of focus. In 90 minutes, the filmmakers seem to want to throw every sort of issue a 17-year-old might face, from sex, to making adult decisions, to relationships, to understanding life, into a subplot for the main characters to face. And unfortunately, these two characters are not written in a way that makes them able to deal with all of these things. Yes, the dialogue between the two is incredibly awkward, but both Cera and Dennings seem quite able to play it into something that still sounds natural. But this comes at the expense of never quite understanding the full motivations of either character, and merely having a small idea of where either is coming from. Sure, there are glimmers of issues either faces (Dennings' Norah seems to have an orgasm problem, in one very out-of-place subplot), but never more than a hint. By the end of the film, I was still attempting to totally grasp how these two lost souls managed to find each other in the first place (other than for the sake of a fantastical teen romance).What is worse is that the supporting characters have a bad habit of getting in the way of the two main characters' story. There is an ongoing bit about trying to find Norah's drunk friend Caroline (Ari Graynor), but every scene she has just seems forced and merely placed as a means of padding out a movie that feels too long already. Much the same goes for Nick's gay bandmates Thom (Aaron Yoo) and Dev (Rafi Gavron). Sure they get the most poignant and hilarious moments in the film (alongside their gay friend who is credited merely as 'Beefy Guy', and is played by Jonathan B. Wright), but their importance to the film seems a bit skewed. Taking away the fact that their being gay feels more like a gimmick than anything else, all three just seem to have little bearing on the film's events other than to drop hints of wisdom and help search for Caroline and Where's Fluffy. Jay Baruchel, fresh from Tropic Thunder, does okay in a small role as Norah's on and off boyfriend, but he does not get nearly enough screen time to make an impression.It seems the only person who is right on the money is Dziena. She plays the manipulative and spoiled ex-girlfriend to great effect, and seems to be the only person who wants to be taken seriously by all the non-teens watching the movie. She takes great pleasure inflicting pain on Nick, and her brazen control-freak chemistry with Cera is a particular joy to watch. Sure Cera basically ends up playing the same shay and nervously introverted character he became famous for last year, but Dziena's extroverted, over-the-top performance contrasts it so well that Cera almost comes off as being better than he actually is here.I think with a little more focus on appealing to all ages instead of just teens, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist could have truly soared as a film. As it stands, it has the makings of a good movie, but not the proper creative output. More development on the main characters, and less scenes with the supporting ones could have only helped make this film great. At least it packs a hell of a good soundtrack.6/10.",6,19,32,8 October 2008
30 Days of Night," Visually magnificent, but lacking a little too much in plot
","30 Days of Night as you can probably guess, is about just that. A town in small rural Alaska, the northern-most town in the US, experiences a phenomenon where darkness sets upon the town for an entire month, and leaves most residents scrambling to get out. But unfortunate for those who stayed, a pack of hungry vampires has found the town and decides they should get fed. And as the dead begin to outnumber the survivors, it becomes very clear that those who can stay alive need to wait out until the sun finally comes up.The sheer idea for the film, having the town being draped in darkness for a month, is nothing short of astounding. Yes, it was lifted and is based on a graphic novel, but compared to your typical vampire-related horror flick, it is quite the step up. And as the film sets itself up for the feeding frenzy, it really continues to breathe originality and a blazing sense of imagination. Some of the things happening may not strike you as being particularly relevant at first (or even, who would do some of these things), but as the film moves along, it just all feels so right. And with a very sombre and coked-out character only referred to as The Stranger (Ben Foster) making bizarre predictions of the inevitably obnoxious death scenes soon to come, the film really feels like it is going to jump past the clichés, the terrible American horror norm, and become something extraordinary and memorable.But then the film betrays itself. It takes far too long to set up the motivations of the main character, Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett), his separated wife Stella (Melissa George), and even more time on supporting characters like the burly Beau Brower (Mark Boone Junior). I just got far too restless, and even more so when I realized only a few of these characters would make it to the final frame of the film. Why should we care about these characters when these laggy scenes just do nothing but introduce their one-dimensional selves, and not much else? It felt kind of like overkill, but also like the film was trying to compensate for having such a great idea, but no idea as to how to flesh it out.And when the survival scenes begin to kick in, it becomes even more of a hit and miss. Some scenes are genuinely terrifying and suspenseful, watching the characters try to cope with decisions of wanting to save their fellow townspeople, or just sit in genuine fear of not wanting to be the next victim. But then others drag on with meaningless drivel about absolutely nothing. It just cannot find the balance it needs to survive this pitfall of the idea for the film, and just does not seem to want to attempt more than a handful of times to try and amend it. And do not even get me started on the preposterous ending, which seems ripped out of an entirely different movie altogether (sad to say, it is almost shot-for-shot intact from the graphic novel).But while the film does have its share of story and pacing problems, the scenes with the vampires attacking are just plain stellar. There are more than a handful of quick cuts, but the majority of the scenes involving them eating their dinners are stylistically beautiful. There are some shots that are just so majestic and so powerful, that one wonders if they are actually in the same horror movie, or if they randomly started splicing in some art-house horror. The tracking shots, the close-ups, the long shots, they are all here, and are all so brilliantly played that the style just takes anything the movie has going for it, and catapults it right into the stratosphere. And even as the violence gets even more senseless and even more graphic, you cannot help but watch in awe at the visuals captured by the camera (and by CGI). Their exquisiteness is enough to make me pray that other mindless (or near mindless) horror flicks take note, and start creating similar if not better visuals. The music is above and beyond top notch as well, giving the film a really heightened sense of style and intense violence (albeit, nowhere near as blood-soaked as I had originally assumed it would be).The cast, for the most part, is alright. Hartnett has seen better days, and for some reason, seems to be struggling as the lead here. Maybe he had something else on his mind? Some of the scenes he is in just do not completely jive, and when they do, there is awkwardness to all of them. I do not like to even imagine saying it, but it looked like he had more heart to show off in Pearl Harbor, then he does here. George on the other hand, does an infinite amount better, continuing much in the same way she did in the very poor remake of The Amityville Horror. She had an aura around her there that felt like she was above the material, and the same aura appears here. Foster, for his limited amount of screen time, does a great deal of delivering dread and despair for a few of the characters. I wish he had more scenery to chew.But it is John Huston, more of a classically refined actor, who owns as the vampire leader. He does not speak any English (he communicates in the vampiric language and through grunts and body motions), but that does not stop him from being almost downright terrifying. Seeing this guy at work was a real pleasure, and I just wish the rest of the film was as well done as his performance is.Nagging issues aside, 30 Days of Night is a decent horror film with aspirations of being better than it is. Watch it for the visuals, and forget about the plot.6/10.",6,5,11,19 October 2007
There Will Be Blood," Beautifully captured, but plagued by length and tone issues
","Going in, I was not exactly sure what to expect of There Will Be Blood. I was never too interested in the film leading up to awards season, but slowly warmed up to the idea of seeing it (if only because of the buzz around Daniel Day-Lewis and the film's eventual Oscar nominations). Yet even a day after seeing it, I am still a bit perplexed about it.There Will Be Blood is a little hard to describe. At once, it is a frenzy of good and evil themes, centred on a gold miner turned oil prospector Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis). He travels through the southern United States with his son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), buying up properties and making money off the oil on the land. On a chance tip, he ends up in California on the Sunday ranch, a rich potential source of oil. And here he meets up with Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a preacher and prophet in a local church, whose religion is not Plainview's forte.The film follows from here, as people know, with Plainview's gradual change of heart from a good natured oil man, to a greedy and self-absorbed money maker. It follows a few subplots here and there, but the main focus is on Plainview.And I think that is where some of the film's problems lie. At 158 minutes, the film has that grand epic aura about it, but the story stalls far too often for it to truly be legendary. I found it only worked in small strands, frequently jumping from time flying right by, to it dragging its heels through the oil. I got bored a few times watching, and for a movie that has more than its share of exciting moments, it truly says a lot. It is bogged down with too much filler for its own good. I realize it had to stay with the whole epic tone, but it just does not stay consistent at all. The subplots, as few as they are, never seem to truly feel resolved or even worthwhile. I really liked the material between Plainview and his son, but the relationship between him and Eli Sunday is never truly explored as well as it should be. For such a strong force in the film, Dano is not given nearly enough to do (even with two roles). When they clash on screen, it is pure magic. But there is not nearly enough of it. And all of the useless moments with Plainview's brother are just that. And for such a coldly serious film (with a rather oddly bizarre score), there were way too many 'funny' scenes. If the only way to silence the audience is for a character to be brutally murdered, I think there is a problem.What I did find most interesting about the film was its unique use of action. It takes almost twenty minutes for any cast member to speak (other than a few grunts from Day-Lewis), and all the entirety of the introduction to both Plainview and H.W. is done through movement and sound. It was not something I was used to, especially with a modern American film in 2008, but it brought a certain sense of beauty and majesty to the film. It allows for a lot less to be said about some of these characters, but it also makes for a greater amount of depth to be absorbed. Paul Thomas Anderson could have easily used an immense amount of dialogue (or voice-over like in No Country for Old Men), but the uncommon method works brilliantly for this film. As it goes on, it uses more dialogue, but it still has many focal points built upon speak-free scenes, and almost all of them work more than the last. The film's art and set direction and cinematography are simply breathtaking. There is a massive amount of detail in every scene, and the massive amount of work bringing to life is awe-inspiring. The one long take involved a flaming oil well is frightening and beautifully captured at the same time. The bright visuals, contrasting with the ever darkening material are just one of the film's strong suits. Anderson has always been a very visual storyteller, and he does not change his ways here. In fact, he matures even further, and gives a great idea of what we should continue to expect from him (and obviously his amazingly talented crew).Day-Lewis, for all of his acclaim, is really good. Not Gangs of New York good, but good nonetheless. His work here is still miles ahead of the competition, but I think I was just expecting too much. He commands every scene he is in, and he's ridiculously over the top as he seems to pride himself on being (especially in the popular 'milkshake' scene), but his effortless look throughout the movie looked to me like he just was not enjoying himself at all. His richly layered character is brought to the screen magnificently, but what is the point if you do not get any fun doing it? I was consistently thinking of Bill 'The Butcher' throughout the entirety of the film, and only a handful of times did he ever come close to matching the sharpness and complexity of that character.I was actually much more impressed by Dano. After Little Miss Sunshine last year, and There Will Be Blood this year, he is truly beginning to make a name for himself. His powerful performance holds its own against Day-Lewis, and he shines exquisitely when it is just him on-screen, or just having Plainview sitting and viewing in the background. I only wish he got more recognition.There Will Be Blood is a brilliantly captured film that has more than a few problems with its story and tone. It packs some great performances, but just do not go in thinking it will be the best of the year.7/10.",7,3,8,3 February 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Whitaker's superb performance turns up the heat in an otherwise inconsistent film
","Late last year, when Oscar pundits were not discussing Helen Mirren or the dozens of candidates for Best Picture, they were talking about one man: Forest Whitaker. He had apparently turned in an amazing performance in The Last King of Scotland, and it was touted right from the start as the winner of the Best Actor trophy. Having really enjoyed the main actor performances in Capote and Ray, I had high hopes for Scotland. And while he delivered, much like the other two, nothing else did.The film centres on idealistic young Scotsman Dr. Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), who has just graduated from college. Wanting to make a difference, he takes out his globe, spins it, and places his finger down on where he wants to go. Uganda ends up being the answer, and Garrigan turns up there just in time for the start of President Idi Amin's (Whitaker) reign. The doctor wants to help the Ugandan people out as much as he can, but after a chance encounter with the charming President, the charismatic doctor is taken in to be his personal physician. Only then does he get to experience what Amin is really like.As intriguing as the film sounds, it really is not all that great. It is riveting in a lot of sequences, but many just drag on without a point. If a point is to be made, it takes about five minutes to get to it, if at all. Numerous subplots are thrown at the viewer, and only a few totally pan out. The rest either crash and burn, or are just never spoken or acted upon after their brief mention. It feels more inconsistent than anything, and the two hour runtime really does help in any case. It just drags the film out longer than it needs to be.This mainly is indebted to the fact that the main character is Garrigan and not Amin. I realize that the film is based on a novel. But after some brief research, it turns out that it is very unlike the novel. So why not make this subtle change to? Focus less on the fictional Scotsman, and do more with the real person. Garrigan is an intriguing character on his own, but having him be the focal point of the movie is not too great an idea. Amin is the compelling character here, and the reason people are seeing the movie in the first place. He should not have to play second fiddle to a wavering fictional entity.But while the main characters have a few issues, the cinematography does not. The beautiful and brutal African landscapes are captured in the awestriking way that North Americans have come to expect. The lush atmosphere (even down to small sequences involving the annoying insects) is represented wonderfully here, despite the subject matter. But in comparison to other harsh African-content films (like The Constant Gardener or Blood Diamond), the film captures a lot of the more upper class areas well too. Every African-based film I have ever taken in is always focused on the deep, dark and ferociously violent areas of the continent. Here, we get to see the more royal side of it, and it is equally if not even better captured than the rough side.I liked the fact that it did not abruptly hold the movie up with historical details forcing the audience to feel the need to rush out and do something. Blood Diamond had that annoying element that totally ruined the film, and I am glad it is not present here. A movie should be subtle about a call for change, not in your face and halting the movie to tell you. The film is also nowhere near as brutal as I imagined, only having a lot of gore and blood appearing closer to the end of the film than to the beginning.I would be lying though if I said that everything in the film is overshadowed by the overbearing and positively excellent portrayal of Amin that Whitaker turns in. You will be hard set to not have your eyes glued to the screen whenever he pops up and starts talking. Right from the start as a bus simply passes Amin waving to a crowd, Whitaker commandeers the screen (and you do not even get to see him again for at least another fifteen minutes). His profound performance is simply not to be missed. Any sequences are livened by his mere presence. His aura is felt in all of the scenes he is in, and even when he does not show up, you can practically smell the impact he has made on the scene and the actors acting within it. And when his character suddenly turns from an absolutely frightening beast to a kind hearted chum and then back again within mere seconds, you know you are watching a master at work. Whitaker more than deserved his Oscar.As hard as he tries, McAvoy just cannot hold up against the force of Whitaker's performance. When he is on the screen for excessively long points of time, even he knows that the audience is begging for more Amin. It is not that his performance is not that great; it is the fact that it feels amateurish at best. He does very well for himself, just not well enough. I understand that this may have been for effect, and may actually prove just how right he was for the naïve doctor. But he just cannot hold the film on his own, and I am sure that everyone who watches it can tell in his struggle to even attempt it.While no other supporting actor even comes close to being good on screen, Whitaker more than makes up for it. The film is flawed and inconsistent, but he is not. His performance had people talking for a reason.7/10.",7,1,3,20 April 2007
American Gangster," An electric performance from Washington does not help the film's meandering storyline
","Much like Martin Scorsese before him, Ridley Scott continues to pump out films with his eyes set out on a little Gold statue for himself. Sure, his last real shot was with Gladiator, which won Best Picture and Best Actor, but failed to net him Best Director. Now, hot on the tails of Scorsese's own Oscar-winning masterpiece The Departed, Scott has climbed into the saddle and created his own crime film in American Gangster.Gangster, much like Departed, is a parallel story. On one end, it follows the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a businessman who deals in the purest heroin New York had seen at the time, and in being black in the early 1970's, is not exactly making a lot of friends. On the other side is Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), a sex-infused detective hell bent on defeating corruption and just being an all around good cop.Right from the offset, the audience knows Lucas and Roberts are going to meet at some point in the film. Scott hypes this up, much like Michael Mann does in Heat and Scorsese does in Departed, by juxtaposing Lucas' rise to the powerful heroin magnet he becomes over time, and Roberts continued battle against corruption both within the police and on the streets. The film never lingers on either one for too long, instead choosing to jump between either man's story every few moments. We share their conflicts, and we share their near triumphant moments. But it also brings about a sense of pathos and ethics, in wondering who we should be cheering for, and who we hope wins by the time the blockbuster meeting takes place.But on that same token, the film fumbles over itself. Yes, it is a rivetingly deep story for the most part, but it has more in common with misdirection and red herrings than I would have liked. Characters are continually introduced and brought into the fold, yet nothing really becomes of them (such as Cuba Gooding Jr., who I hope can now use this film as a replacement for half of the garbage listed on his resume after Jerry Maguire). Yes, they do build up the story, and yes, a lot of these events with minor characters help move the film along, but they just do not feel all that needed in the grand scheme of things. A few of the scenes feel like filler just to pad the film into getting prestige status as a three hour epic on par with the greats of the 1970's. It feels a lot like it is cheating itself out of being truly great by playing these scenes up, and really could have felt a lot tighter and stronger if many of these were cut right out of the picture. When the film wants to be electrifying and blazing fast, it is. But in many other cases, it tangles itself up in near boredom inducing sequencing.One reason they feel so unnecessary is the cheapening and misuse of many of the supporting characters. Characters like Gooding Jr.'s Nicky Barnes and Josh Brolin's rival Detective Trupo are clearly important to the film, but they get next to no time to really shine. When the film is not meandering through scenes it does not need, it races through scenes that could have helped strengthen it, especially if it was left at the same running time as it currently sits at. I wanted to know more about these characters, and I wanted to discover their significance. But despite some really great work coming out of these supporting characters (especially from Brolin), the film just does not call for anyone to really care about these characters and their impact on the film. It just seems to care about the Denzel and Russell show more often than not.Washington, in the main character role, is absolutely electrifying as Lucas. The role is his juiciest since Training Day, and he knows it. He plays the character with a smoldering sense of tenderness and downright evil. I have yet to see an actor who could trade the two traits off so interchangeably and so inexplicably easy as Washington does here. I did care what happened to his character and was scared for him, but at the same time, I was terrified of the guy too. He was not someone to mess with, and Washington makes it crystal clear that the man should be feared. Crowe on the other hand, is a bit of a tossup. He is really good here, but only when he wants to be. He looks very unenthused for the majority of the movie, but delivers when the scene asks for it. He is a strong performer no doubt, but his subdued and near unnatural performance does not any chance to stand next to Washington's overpoweringly memorable take equally.While it has story and character issues, the film itself is filmed quite beautifully. Harking back to imagery from the likes of Scarface, The French Connection and The Godfather, American Gangster paints the image of a nitty gritty New York. The film is a very dark picture, and it lends itself to some pretty stark imagery. There is minor light and bright images littered throughout the film, but there is a certain sense of subdued grey that is carried for the majority of it. It definitely felt authentic to the time period, and the details in keeping this way are numerous. Even the costumes have been detailed to a point of timed perfection. Both helped make the film more riveting when it was losing steam quickly.American Gangster, for as much as it does right, does not live up to everything people had hoped for. It has everything the greats have, but it just does not seem to know how to line up all the pieces. It is a worthwhile venture, but not one that needed to be so lengthy.8/10.",8,1,8,3 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Helm's great screenplay and Ferrell's astonishing acting make for an excellent film
","I liked the idea of Stranger than Fiction from the start. And I still like the idea after having seen the film. I was not a big fan of all the huge press first-time screenwriter Zach Helm was getting, but in comparison to the ballooning publicity with Sascha Baron Cohen and Borat!, it was not too bad. I continually looked forward to seeing the film, and am glad that the great trailer did not reveal everything like I had originally assumed.The film involves Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS agent who lives his life by a very strict routine. One day, he wakes up, and begins to hear a woman narrating all of his actions. Suspicious, Crick continues attempting to live his life out, but after an inexplicable comment in regards to his 'immenent death', he goes on the hunt for the voice. Randomly spliced into Crick's search is Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson). She is writing a novel about a character named Harold Crick, and is unknowingly the voice Crick keeps hearing. She is battling a case of writer's block, and spends much of the film attempting to come up with the finale for the character.Unlike many other existential comedies, Fiction is sweet and almost innocent in its design. Yes, the main focus of the film is pretty grim, but the life-altering questions that keep going around during the film do not become anywhere near as depressing and bizarre as those found in the likes of the work of Charlie Kaufman. In a way, Fiction feels a lot like a Kaufman-written film, but lacking in the means of being totally 'out there'; almost like being a decaf as opposed to a regular. As a result, while being an excellent film (albeit slightly predictable), it cannot break past the mold already set by the likes of the absolutely brilliant Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It just feels like it is missing that spark that could have sprung it right into the brilliance that all films like this strive for.Going along with the story itself, it feels a little ill-paced in some few instances, but for the most part sucks you right in and keeps you there. It has many comedic elements, and has some great dramatic sequences as well. They all play well, and while I still would not give him a ton of credit, I was very impressed by Helm's first-time effort. His writing feels vibrant and fresh, and in a film industry with absolutely little originality or thought, it is just great that movies like this slip through and get green-lighted. Every piece of dialogue and background feels well expressed, and just play out astonishingly well. On the topic of Crick however, I liked the idea of how neurotic and obsessive Crick was over numbers, but I thought it was a bit of an overkill to include special effect shots showing the numbers being counted within his head. It felt silly in The Da Vinci Code, so why did Sony feel the need to add it here too? On that note, much like my being impressed by Adam Sandler from time to time, Ferrell really pulls through here, and does give the best performance of his short career. The psychological trauma that his character goes through is evident in his facial and body emotions, and the way he conveys it on screen is nowhere near what I would have expected. He brings an amazing sense of what this character is really about, and gives him a poignancy that makes him so life-like that it becomes almost too great to explain. This is a pathetically sad man who you cannot help but pull for as the film goes on. And for all the right reason too. He may deliver some of the funniest lines in the movie, but he is totally mature and at ease in this role. Thankfully this means that he stays serious for the most part throughout the film, and does not let any Ricky Bobby or Ron Bergundy slip out. He could have easily blown it, but thankfully, manages to stay in check.Thompson is another particular standout, especially in contrast to Ferrell. She is broken and weak, searching for the perfect ending. The pain and sorrow that goes through her face as she writes and thinks has a poetic excellence to it, and she only continues to prove how good of an actor she is. Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifah work well in supporting roles, supporting Ferrell and Thompson respectively as the film progresses on. Hoffman has always had great comedic timing, and he does not let it go to waste here. He plays right off of Ferrell in grand ways, and just feels totally at home in the role. Latifah, while not in the film so much, is very good in her bit parts. Maggie Gyllenhaal also shines here, and clearly has the makings for an Oscar sometime in the late future.For its small problems, Fiction still is able to prove its worth, and is clearly one of the best films of the year. It will be able to stand proud among the other entries in the existential comedy genre, or just stand proud on its own. Helm's screenplay coupled in with an intoxicatingly great performance by Ferrell make for a great trip to the movies. And sure beats some of the crap that's been released over the past few weeks.9/10.",9,301,357,10 November 2006
The Reader," Not great, but nowhere near as bad as it is being made out to be
","Like almost everyone, I was stunned on January 22 to find that The Reader was nominated for Best Picture. Not just because it was in and the likes of The Dark Knight, Gran Torino and Revolutionary Road were out, but because it seemed like the nomination was almost out of nowhere. Controversy about the nomination brewed, but obviously, nothing is going to change it. So with an intrigued mind, I went in expecting the worst movie ever made about the Holocaust.A young Michael Berg (David Kross) is ill, and is helped by a woman named Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). She is young, but is about double Michael's age. He recovers in bed for months, and goes back to Hanna to thank her for her help. Shortly after, the pair begin a lustful affair that lasts only for a summer. Years later, as Michael sits in on a trial against female Nazi guards, he is shocked to find Hanna among the group.The film does a fairly adequate job jumping between this core story and the older Michael (Ralph Fiennes) remembering it and the fallout that came afterwards. He acts almost as a narrator, but more of an outsider looking into what his life was and became as the years went on.To say the film is a Holocaust film is not accurate. Sure, Hanna goes on trial for being a Nazi guard during the war, but outside of these scenes (and minor, haunting scenes in Auschwitz), the film takes place almost entirely in Germany well after the war. It is obviously easy to classify the film as a Holocaust film, but it spends more time dwelling on everything that came after than it does even mentioning the events that transpired. It is an intriguing angle, and one that does not come around too often in mainstream cinema.But the crux of the film is in the love story between Michael and Hanna. Seeing these two lovers passionately making love is at once just as beautiful as it is creepy. Director Stephen Daldry and the masterful Roger Deakins use very soft angles to express the feelings these two have for each other. And even with the immense amount of nudity, it is very tastefully done. A lot of time is spent lingering on the naked, imperfect flesh of both actors, and it helps to express the emotional hold these two have on each other.Unfortunately, it never seems to be explained why the pair gets together in the first place. We understand some of the motivations, but we never have a clear idea why Hanna would risk so much by having an affair with so young a man. In fact, the first scene the pair has that involves their love is jarringly unbalanced. It is powerful enough to evoke an immediate response, but just seems bizarre later on. Their relationship is vaguely acceptable (albeit slightly disturbing), but it hinges on so little that you wonder why these two have such a strong emotional bond. It almost seems weird to think, but with so much time spent on these early scenes, you would expect a bit more to be discussed and explained, as opposed to merely leaving it to the vices of Michael's older mind, remembering the majority of it as it happened.Another unfortunate thing is the lack of development in Michael and Hanna. Their backstories are never really explained before they meet each other, and the most we learn about Hanna other than her 'secret' is the bit about her being a Nazi guard. And even then, we learn very little of what she did, or why she did it. We get no explanations about what lead up to Michael's illness, nothing on how he ended up in law school, and even less on the events of his adulthood. We merely get mentions and vague ideas to help establish who he has become. These two are clearly well written characters, but not enough to make the audience feel like they were truly developed. There is too much of an enigmatic side to both characters that one will never feel satisfied with what is covered (even if it would have dragged the film out longer than it is already).Relative newcomer Kross is fabulous in his role. He helps hold the film on his shoulders alongside Fiennes, but he delivers the bravest performance of anyone. Sure, Fiennes is great and very subtle in his role, but he is not the powerhouse that Kross is. Seeing him develop from a teenager to a young man is an exercise is astonishing, and seeing his emotional range makes me wonder why we have very little American actors that can pull off similar feats. He just seems to know exactly how to tap into Michael's psyche, and knows just what darkest depths this character feels he has gotten himself into. Watching him question his ethical judgment merely through facial contortions is worth a review all in itself. He has sadly gone underrated through the awards circuit, and it is really a shame. I can only hope he keeps it up with work like this.Winslet is just as great as you have heard. Much like in Revolutionary Road, she is a character going through an existential crisis plagued by tragedy and heartbreak. She plays Hanna very coldly, only letting the audience in at a few points. She wants us to feel the character's pain, and she wants us to see her as the confused individual that she is. Her performance is strong, and her emotions even stronger. But she lacks the will to make this as devastating a portrayal as in Road, so it seems rather eerie that the Academy picked this role instead.It's not great, but The Reader is not as bad as most have made it out to be. The story just needed to be as strong as the performances.7/10.",7,4,6,17 February 2009
The Wrestler," A legendary performance in a dirty, gritty film
","Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is an aging wrestler who has seen better days. He was a huge star in the 1980s, but is merely reliving his glory days through the independent circuit now. He still has his fans, but things are obviously not the same as they were. He is relegated to living in a shoddy trailer home he can barely afford, and his only real emotional connection is through a stripper, Cassidy (Marisa Tomei) he has to pay in order to talk to.To say that this is Rourke's comeback film is an understatement. This film is a resurrection. He was barely recognizable under all the makeup and special effects wizardry in his excellent performance in Frank Miller's Sin City, and he is almost as unrecognizable here without the makeup. He transforms himself into The Ram, and makes a fool out of anyone that said he could never pull off a great performance again. This performance is the stuff of legend, and is almost miraculous in how it was pulled off.Rourke plays the character with just enough desperation and heartbreak it needs. Sure, it helps that the character is so close in ties to what Rourke had become, but giving it that personal touch gives the film a certain aura of authenticity that it needs to truly be believable. If the filmmakers had picked someone else, it is doubtful they could have given this role the heart and intensity that Rourke does. He knows this character, and he puts an immense amount of effort into bringing him to life. Watching him prepping for a match, coming out of a match as a bloody mess, sitting at a 'convention' with his aged memorabilia, or just seeing him attempt to be a part of regular society is just heartbreaking. He looks and feels alienated, and seeing this look on the hulking face of Rourke gives the film and the character a whole new meaning. This is someone who had it all, threw it away and now has to deal with the consequences. But fortunately enough, the outlook is a whole lot more positive for Rourke than it is for The Ram.But not all the praise for this miraculous transformation should go to Rourke.Darren Aronofsky does just as much, if not more to make this film as heartbreakingly real as he does. The amount of personal devotion to this film is amazing. Along with Cinematographer by Maryse Alberti and Editor Andrew Weisblum, Aronofsky has created a down and dirty independent picture about a down and dirty business. It is gritty and unflinching when it comes to portraying the risks wrestlers go through to provide blood-thirsty fans a piece of entertainment for the night. And these are not even the types found in the more commonly seen WWE-style matches on television. These are the amateur circuits, where anything goes and the money made is not always worth it. The low angled shots and filthy atmospheres are presented with such a look that you may wonder if you are not actually watching a documentary. It is that real, and that authentic looking.Sometimes, the film gets so real that it may be hard to take. I know I grimaced more than once at the gritty way Aronofsky shot the matches we see early on in the film. A weapons-laden match I would have clamored for as a kid looks downright disgusting and vile now. The film is laden with these sorts of in-your-face gruesome shots, but it shows the reality of what this lifestyle is like and the pains these people have to put up with in the name of entertainment. The reality is painful, and just terrifying in some instances. And made all the worse by the knowledge that this film is based in reality and is not entirely fictional.While there are many supporting characters, the only ones who get any real time to do anything are Tomei and Wood. Tomei is great in her role, and continues to prove that My Cousin Vinny was not a fluke. Her character is going through the same has-been mentality that Rourke's is, and you can see the saddened, sullied look in her face throughout the film. Her character craves more, but is unfortunately stuck in a rut she cannot get out of. She is clearly overshadowed by the powerhouse Rourke is, but she holds her own anyway. Wood on the other hand, is merely just good. Many of her films have been about misunderstood and ignored children, but her heart does not seem to be totally into this role. She gets very little screen time, and much of it is highly emotional, but she just does not have the chops to complement Rourke. She has done much better work in the past.The film is also dragged down by a lengthy running time. This is a blazingly paced movie, but scenes that come late in the film feels misplaced, and almost entirely unneeded. We understand The Ram from the moment the movie starts; we do not need even more additional tidbits. It borders on overkill, and frequently feels a bit draggy. It is a problem that has plagued many movies from 2008, but while it does not destroy the film like it does in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, it does not help it much either.The film is far from perfect, but is an excellent nonetheless. Rourke's performance is nothing short of amazing. If he had not proved his worth as an actor before, he has more than proved himself now. This is memorable and legendary work that will not soon be forgotten.8/10.",8,1,1,22 February 2009
Hancock," Good ideas spoiled by a messy movie
","I was not expecting much from Hancock. After his dramatic turn in the rather disappointing The Pursuit of Happiness, and the promising but fatally flawed I Am Legend, I was not sure I was going to be able to accept and genuinely enjoy another Will Smith movie. And sure enough, even going in with low expectations was not enough.Hancock tells the story of the titular hero (Smith), who in a rather original move, is a mean-spirited alcoholic. He helps save the day for many in Los Angeles, but at the price of causing millions of dollars worth of damage, and offending just about everyone. He saves Ray Embry (Jason Bateman), a public relations agent, from certain death, and as a thank you, Ray wants to clean up Hancock's image.The actual great thing about Hancock is that it is, for the most part, an original idea. Yes, comic book fans may recognize the alcoholism as a trademark of Tony Stark, but it makes for a hell of a character dynamic for this so-called superhero. As well, unlike the comic book film superheroes we have come to understand, Hancock does not want to be a hero. He just wants to be appreciated for what he does do, and left alone all the rest of the time. And of course, as would be typical for Smith, Hancock is a bit of a wise-ass. All of these elements lead to a superhero character unlike any we have seen (although he borrows from Superman's books and can fly and deflect bullets).But unfortunately, that is nearly the only great thing this movie has to offer.The movie plays itself loose and extremely fast. The brief explanation I gave for the film encompasses nearly half an hour of the film's running time. And for a film that runs less than an hour and a half, that may sound like a bit much to chew on. But somehow, the film flies through from point to point, only pausing for seconds at a time to explain what is happening. And much like I Am Legend, the film veers off into a completely different direction in the third act that nearly completely defeats the purpose of the previous two (although anyone who knows the big revealing moment already may be disappointed to know it does not build on much more). In this case, it attempts to explain the mythology behind the character, but fails because of how convoluted and useless it sounds. Even worse is the dramatic tone change from action romp to hardcore drama that is handled even less well.It is obvious even as early as the film's opening shots that director Peter Berg is trying to do something different. As if taking on an original superhero was not enough, Berg wanted to make it feel even less like a superhero movie, and more like a coming-of-age/outsider tale. While this is an admirable thought, the script is not nearly strong enough to let it happen. It just does not seem to know what it wants to be, and has an even bigger problem trying to understand its main character. Should we feel sorry for him? Maybe at the beginning, but less and less as the film goes along. Its three distinct acts are just that: distinct. They all want to accomplish something different, and when meshed together, they just do not work out. The ideas may be intriguing, but there should have been more experienced writers on hand to explore them.What is even more inexcusable is the lack of development in the supporting characters. While Hancock has something to work with early on, the rest of the cast has to hobble along just to hold themselves up. Bateman's character has an ongoing subplot about an idea he has for pharmaceutical companies to benefit the less fortunate, but we understand very little about who he is, and even less about how wealthy he appears to be (despite some rather negative feedback on the idea he has). He is basically negated to simply watching Hancock do his thing after he works his PR magic. Charlize Theron, cast as Bateman's wife Mary, has something about her right from the moment she pops on screen. You can tell the filmmakers are trying to play up on her development by making her so cynical about Hancock, but when her character finally needs to be used, she falters and flops in an instant. Her character serves a point, but at the expense of being useless all the rest of the time. The rest of the supporting cast, save for The Embrey's adorable son Aaron (Jae Head), are all underused to the point that crediting them would be a waste of time.Smith, attempts to make his character work, but the inherent problems at the core of Hancock's script plague his good work. Yes, he can play wise-ass very good, but he has some good moments of pathos, but not nearly enough to make the audience truly feel for him. Smith plays the character much like others, with very little regard for not basically playing himself (or at least, the image he displays for the public). Maybe another dose of The Pursuit of Happiness, where he is very un-Will Smith-like, is exactly what the man needs to wake up and actually show off some form of acting chops.Thankfully, the music and special effects pull through basically unscathed (although a few of the flying scenes looked terribly fake).While at its heart, Hancock may have been a good idea for a new superhero movie, it did not turn out to be one in the end. Bad writing and sloppy direction take away from any great ideas that could have been infused into the script, and sadly, it does not look like anyone appears to care. And unfortunately, that is the saddest thing about this mess of a movie.4/10.",4,2,5,5 August 2008
Inception," Words cannot begin to describe this enigmatic genre-bending masterpiece
","As I read reviews, theories and just general thoughts on Inception, it baffles me how so many people seem to be able to put their ideas about the film into words. I instantly knew how I really felt about the film less than a second into the credits, but trying to comprehend Christopher Nolan's daring vision, much less attempting to put it into words, is one of the hardest tasks I have had to do for such a recent film. That alone should tell you the power and gravitas this brilliantly conceived pseudo-blockbuster has and will continue to have an effect on audiences.In true genre-bending form, Inception revolves around Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man whose occupation is to literally steal the dreams of others. Using a rather incredibly looking device, Cobb can enter a person's dreams and literally extract their most treasured secrets. After a botched attempt on Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe), the man comes back to Cobb with a proposition. Instead of stealing an idea, he wants Cobb to plant an idea into the mind of oil company heir Robert Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy) – the act of which is called Inception. Cobb has his doubts about whether Inception could work, but he brings a team together, and then the real mindbending fun begins.Without a doubt, Inception is Nolan's enigmatic masterpiece. The film was hyped for months, but I can still not help but feel it came out of nowhere in how much of a chord it strikes. It is the kind of film that only comes around very infrequently, and tends to not have people talking until years after its release. But this film is far from a predetermined cult classic. This is an unequivocal blockbuster of the highest degree – one that never falters from its lofty and pseudo intellectual ideals. It obviously owes more than a small amount of gratitude to The Dark Knight for even being able to get made in the first place, but even more to the likes of The Matrix, Dark City, Blade Runner, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and so many more like them.The praise for this film comes specifically out of the script and the sheer ideas driving the film. Dreams and the imagery behind them are inherently difficult ideas to grasp. There are whole sects of researchers and theorists who devote their lives to understanding them, yet after an initially staggering explanation, Nolan manages to make sense of them and develop a whole film based around them. It is more than enough to chew, but it is still easily digestible. What occurs as the film goes on may baffle some viewers, but that is the beauty of the whole project. It develops and extrapolates on deep ideas rarely seen in the realm of summer movies, and even movies in general. There is just so much inherent ambition and drive to the film that you wonder why there are so few filmmakers willing to take the plunge into this kind of reckless, thought-provoking filmmaking.The film is also stunning in how majestically edited it is. Incredible special effects, camera angles, and wire acrobatics are only the beginning of how stuffed this film is. The running time was always the only problem I had with The Dark Knight, and I feared it would work against Inception as well. But the opposite happened. Inception feels all too short by its ending, as if it could have been longer. The film is a riveting, edge of your seat experience at any given time. It packs on the action, drama, suspense, and thrilling moments at every turn, grabs you, and never lets up. I actually am quite certain I forgot to breathe during the last twenty minutes of the film, and struggled to look away during everything that came before it. It is just that strong, and that unique of a picture. It is the rare type of movie that ends, and you immediately will want to watch it again, no matter how long it is.After an astonishing turn in Shutter Island (a film whose storyline and themes play all too close to this one), DiCaprio still manages to launch this film out of the park. He has just as much wild audacity on-screen as Nolan does off-screen, and he plays it with such recklessness that you can barely even attempt to think of someone else coming close to playing Cobb as great as he does. The man never lets up, and only intensifies himself as each scene passes. He is the emotional crux of the picture, and is just as riveting and spellbinding as the picture itself. He knows just what moves to make, what emotions to hit, and what chemistry he needs to have with the rest of the cast.My only real problem with the movie, outside of it being so enigmatic, ambiguous and generally left to the audience's own imaginations, is that the film has very little character development for anyone other than Cobb. As great as she is in her supporting role, Ellen Page's job as Ariadne is to explain the film and its mindbending concepts to the audience. Joseph-Gordon Levitt gets quite a bit of time to shine, but Tom Hardy and Dileep Rao get far too little to do. Watanabe, Murphy and an absolutely incredible Marion Cotillard are the only ones who seem to get some form of development, but not nearly enough.In the end, I know further analysis and multiple rewatches will negate this small gripe, but as it is, Inception is the must-see movie of the summer and the first great movie of the decade. Nolan has truly delivered a film I can only think to call brilliant. This is the type of magical filmmaking that only comes around too little. Everyone who enjoys watching films, no matter the kind of film-goer, owes it to themselves to experience Inception.9.5/10.",9,4,9,25 July 2010
Lord of War," Flawed, but fascinating
","It's not necessarily a bad film, but a flawed one that could have been improved easily.The entire premise of the film, following a gunrunner through his trade, and the constant narration by Nicolas Cage is absolutely riveting. You can't get enough of his character, Yuri Orlav. He's a very bad guy, but you watch the dissection of his character, from young guy growing up in Brooklyn slums, to a witty SOB selling guns to people who would shoot him in an instant, and it's all excellent. His performance on screen proves that there still is acting talent in Hollywood, and it's no wonder why Cage won an Oscar and is still pulling in crowds (albeit, not as huge as back in the day).But the problem with the film is not Cage. Or even his co-stars. Even though it's Cage-centric, Jared Leto, Bridget Moynahan, Ian Holm, Eamonn Walker, and even Ethan Hawke all pull in some very good performances, even though some of them are barely in it. Leto is really starting to seem more than a pretty face (maybe an Oscar nom for Chapter 27?).It's not the visuals either. From the fabulous opening sequence involving the creation, shipment and final resting place of a machine gun bullet, to the fast editing techniques throughout the film, it never lets up. The cinematography is particularly a standout, and the scenes in Africa come later in the film, be prepared for some really beautiful sequences. While The Constant Gardener may have nailed the life in Africa to beyond an art, this film still brings outstanding beauty to the landscape. The way that some of the shots are set up, even when not in Africa, are pure genius.No, the problem is the story. After the initial narration, and the setup of the film, it just falls apart. Yuri sells gun, Yuri gets in trouble with Valentine, Yuri continues selling guns. For 2 hours, it's the same thing. Even with significant plot points flying around, the cycle continues on and on. While the movie begs to be interesting, it just falls apart at the seams, and can't get back up on performances alone. Even though you can't stop watching, you know deep down that the movie has fallen into boredom territory. It's a real shame too.While the life of a gunrunner is an interesting concept, it could have been pulled off much smoother in its translation from script to screen. A polish of the script could have helped this film greatly, and made this underrated film even more appreciated, and seen during its initial run.7.5/10.",7,1,2,1 April 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Entertaining enough, but far from perfect
","Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) is terrorizing England until he is finally captured by Detective Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and his trusty partner Dr. John Watson (Jude Law). But after being put to death, Blackwood returns from the grave and intensifies his plot to control the country. Of course, with Scotland Yard only moderately helping, it is up to Holmes to defeat Blackwood.I was really pumped for Sherlock Holmes based solely off trailers, even if Guy Ritchie's contemporary interpretation did not necessarily coincide with the mainstream image of Holmes (a bare-knuckle boxer, really?). It also helps that in the tail end of the decade, Downey Jr. can basically do no wrong acting wise, as he either owns every movie he is in or makes subpar movies watchable for his performance alone (as anyone who has seen the Oscar-baiting film The Soloist can attest). But while the film's trailers make the film look like an riotously funny, action packed time, the film itself is a little different.Having not even attempted to view Swept Away (or Revolver in its entirety), I cannot speak for Richie's complete directorial resume. But Sherlock is both his slowest paced film, and the least stylistically edited. Whereas Snatch and RocknRolla were both off the rails editing wise, packed with plenty of style and Tarantino-infused dialogue and scenery, Sherlock comes off as a far more brooding film. Right after the opening sequence, I knew the film would feel every bit of its 130-minute running time, and to my surprise, it felt even longer. Some scenes drag out far past their best before date, and others just feel like they could have been edited a bit better. None of this makes the film bad per se, but it does take away from the lasting effect the film gives. I enjoyed the rocking action scenes, but by the end of the film, I just really wanted it to end more than anything.Compounding these lengthy scenes are more than a handful that take the viewer out of the film. I understand Holmes as a character has a penchant for being very particular about how he acts as a detective (by means of course, of someone from the late 1800s), but some of the more theoretical material just seems like it got beaten to death over the course of the film. One specific scene in particular, involving drugs and black magic, just looked totally out of place in context with the rest of the film. I was more confused than anything seeing some of these scenes play out, and really wanted to believe the filmmakers could have pulled some of it together more cohesively and in a shorter running time. I really wanted to adore the movie, but it was scenes like that which seemed like they were better off on the cutting room floor.What it seems like the filmmakers focused on instead was bringing the world of Sherlock Holmes to life. The atmosphere, the mood, the feeling of every set and every costume feels very much in the realm of what we have come to know and love about the character. It may have been made in the late 2000s, but it feels very much like it belongs in the late 1800s. Yes, some of the effects look like they could have been better rendered, but the world Sherlock lives in is near perfect. The scenery and art direction practically comes to life as the camera sweeps past its luscious beauty. Every single corner is very much of its time, right to the last minute detail. Visually, the film is stunning in every frame, and the running time only helps to showcase it strongly in each scene.But the greatness that lies within Sherlock Holmes belongs solely with the cast more than anything else. Even at its most incredulous or boring sequences, never once does the cast change for an instant. Everyone is right at home in their roles, embodying them with a hint of class and a great deal of precision. They all feel just as real as the next person, and help make the film all the more authentic.Downey Jr. as said previously can do no wrong and only further proves it in the title role. He is electrifying from start to finish, nailing the British accent to a tee, and nailing this new age Sherlock even better. While it is not quite as perfect a performance as his rendition of Tony Stark (who after multiple viewings, has proved to be the role he was born to play), his interpretation of Sherlock is very strong. The unreliable and questionable techniques Sherlock is known for are made all the better in Downey Jr.'s hands. The man has come a long way as an actor, and it is roles like these that stretch his range and make him all the better.While I was baffled at the thought of Law as Watson, he proves to be even better than I imagined he would be. It helps that he is actually from the United Kingdom and is not just putting on his accent, but watching him act alongside Downey Jr. in some of the more fun sections of the film only proves that he was the right man for the job. While I would have liked a bit more emphasis on Black's Blackwood, he does a more than adequate job with what he is given. Much the same goes for Rachel McAdams as the mysterious Irene Adler, who spends the majority of the film as more of an enigma than the love interest she should be.While it is far from perfect, there is more than enough to enjoy from Sherlock Holmes. The feel of the film makes it a worthwhile watch on its own, but the performances of Downey Jr. and Law are what really drive the film.7.5/10.",7,1,6,5 January 2010
WALL·E," Pixar knocks another one out of the park
","I did not quite know what to make of WALL-E when I first saw the previews for it. It did not look like a typical animated film at all, and seemed like a huge undertaking, even for as big a giant as Pixar is in the realm of animation. But imagination and originality is something Pixar has always been known for (as well as making great movies aimed at all ages), and this film is no exception.WALL-E tells the story of a robot who seems to be one of the last inhabitants living on Earth. He spends his days collecting immense amounts of trash, and then compacts it into smaller squares of garbage that he ends up building into large structures. He collects specific items that he categorizes in his pseudo-trailer home, and watches Hello Dolly! at night, hoping for some sort of interaction with something other than a cockroach. And as anyone can predict, his prayers are answered in the form of the female robot EVE who lands on Earth to carry out a classified mission. And getting to know her is only the start of this robot's adventure.I had my doubts, but Pixar have really outdone themselves with this one.Without a shadow of a doubt in my mind, WALL-E is one of the most original pieces of cinema I have ever encountered. While not necessarily a silent film, the film features very little talking, and mainly features characters who speak to each other through machine noises and the use of their name (and WALL-E and EVE are not the only two kinds of robots featured in the film). But one would be hard-set to notice the lack of dialogue because of how enthralling the film is. From the mere first glance at WALL-E, the film draws the audience into this little robot's role in life, and his inevitable adventure. This could have easily been made into a gimmicky film, but Pixar never lets it stray too far from the epic scope it set out for the film from the opening shot onwards.The story, without ruining it, is very simplistic. But not in a way that will make people easily write it off. Rather, it is simplistic in how very uncomplicated it is. The characters of WALL-E and EVE can only show so much depth, and for that reason, there is not a whole lot to their story. Yes, there are some genuinely moving scenes I thought impossible to see coming from CGI-animated robots, but this film manages to make a whole group of robots emote in all kinds of ways. There is a bit of social satire thrown in for good measure as well, which helps deepen the spiritual conscience of the film, and helps flesh out a few of the key points WALL-E's chosen career and lifestyle seem to nod at. But as said, the film never gets too ahead of itself, and never once bites off more than it can chew. It knows what it wants to accomplish, and it manages to do it very easily.But with it being a Pixar film, there is a certain assumption that the animation will be pristine and nearly perfect. WALL-E, although released a mere year after the visually stunning Ratatouille, could be the best any of their films have ever looked. The vast landscapes (both on Earth and through space), diverse range of characters and the breathtaking amount of action taking on place are all nearly jaw dropping. Watching the scene with WALL-E flying through space is a marvel all on its own, if only for the brilliant usage of so many colours. The animation is so detailed that you can see the ingrained dirt and patches of rust that cover WALL-E's body. Pixar just keeps upping their ante in how marvellous their animation is, and I can only imagine it is going to get better as the years go on.What truly sets this film apart from others, is that it does not try to be different. It feels just like any other Pixar film, and despite the lack of dialogue, is just as funny and charming as the rest of them. Somehow, director/writer Andrew Stanton has realized that the simplicity of the film can only help build up its charm and real world wit. The film is crafted in a way that makes it nearly impossible not to fall in love with and hang on every moment that passes. WALL-E wants to be seen on the same level as other animated flicks, and it looks like the filmmakers spent an immense amount of time making the film accessible to anyone, dialogue plagued or not.The film is not perfect however. The ending seems a little forced, and a touch silly (especially based on what the audience learns over the course of the film up to that point), but the genuine sense of adventure is enough to not make a big deal out of it. As well, even though the movie practically flies through its running time, there is still a bit of dull weight in certain scenes. They accomplish what they are set out to do, but there was more than a few instances where specific scenes could have been cut, and the film would have turned out the same way.But even through its imperfections, the film sucks you into its naive and adorable world where our hero is a robot who makes robot noises and says his own name a lot. It speaks absolute volumes that this film can be made and not make anyone at Pixar or Disney break a sweat. WALL-E is one of the most original and heartfelt films of this or any other year, and skipping it would be a disservice to the animation genre. It is one hell of a cute and funny movie, and easily one of the year's best.9/10.",9,7,13,28 June 2008
The Good Shepherd," Interesting, but hindered by its length
","I am a big fan of Robert DeNiro. And when I heard about his official second picture, The Good Shepherd, I was very excited and intrigued all at once to see it. I waited for months for a trailer or even a hint at whether or not the small Oscar buzz was actually right about the film. I was saddened by the dying buzz, and even more so when I heard some of the reviews.The Good Shepherd is about the 'birth' of the CIA and centres around Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a fictitious character based on a real life person(s) involved in its creation. The film starts out with the botched Bay of Pigs operation in 1961, and continues to jump back and forth between the days that followed and Wilson's past before that moment. Starting with his moments at Yale and his eventual induction into the ultra-secret 'Skull and Bones' group, it continues onto early savvy and spy-worthy tactic moments abroad during World War II, and then through the Cold War up until the Bay of Pigs.But The Good Shepherd is not primarily all CIA and political-based. There are many moments featuring Wilson's first love, Laura (Tammy Blanchard), a deaf woman he meets at school, and even more featuring his wife Clover, who later goes by Margaret (Angelina Jolie). As well, many of the key moments in the film are directed towards his relationship with his son, Edward Jr. (Eddie Redmayne as an adult, Tommy Nelson as a child), who he only meets after returning home from the war.On the whole, DeNiro's sophomore effort works well, but only to a point. It is excellently crafted, and the conviction he has for the work is shown throughout. The one thing that holds it back from being a true marvel or the so-called 'Godfather of CIA movies', is the fact that it is just too long. Clocking in at 167 minutes, the movie just could have done with a good twenty to twenty-five minutes excised right out of it. It is interesting yes, but it is not particularly thrilling in most cases and probably could have been much stronger had the film been shorter. It is not that DeNiro does not know how to focalize on something, or know when to say enough is enough. It is the fact that some scenes just go on and on aimlessly, and others just begin and end in no time. His ultimate success as a director is seriously hindered by this, and is ultimately why the film will not hit as many audiences as it should.Eric Roth's screenplay is very well done, and highly proficient in the history it covers. Yes, it may be fictionalized for the majority, but it is still quite the intriguing take on such a tumultuous time in world history. At times however, it covers a bit too much and rails a bit off course (which was a problem for DeNiro too). The cinematography excels in many areas, despite being fairly generic in many sequences. The costumes are interesting and authentic all the same. They feel slightly contemporary in a few cases, but at the same time, feel as if they are from the 1930's to the 1960's. The dresses the female cast members wear are obvious look-alikes to those worn at this time period, but some of the suits the males wear feel a bit too closer to 2006 than they do the 1950's. I also liked how refined everyone was, and how they all felt in step with the era. Many movies created now feel as if the extras are all living now, and the main cast members are trying to live back then. Here, everyone is all the same, and no one feels or looks out of place.Damon, although quite strong in Martin Scorsese's The Departed, is infinitely more powerful here. Although his character looks and sounds one-dimensional, Damon brings a sense of urgency to him. Defined by a stern and melancholic look for about ninety-eight percent of the film, he really has to work hard to show any emotion other than being angry and disgruntled. His trademark smile appears only a few times, as he stays in check with his solid frowning face. His eyes really do more of the emotional output for his character, and you can really see the intensity in them as certain things are occurring. The hurt and aging eyes he sports are the decisive factor for his character, and are what helps propel him out of one-dimensionality.Jolie is okay in her role as the neglected wife, but she really does nothing amazing here. Her chemistry is lacking with Damon, and he just does not have any strength at all in her role, disregarded or not. Blanchard and Redmayne are particularly inspiring in their roles, and really help increase the emotional intensity of the film. Supporting turns from DeNiro himself, John Turturro, William Hurt, Michael Gambon, Alec Baldwin and Billy Crudup are all well done, and very focused. A bit more characterization would have helped for most of them, as they appear multiple times, and very little is said of who they are and/or their importance to the story. Oleg Stefan is a particular standout as the Russian adversary only really known as 'Ulysses'. He really chomps into his pseudo-villainous role, and has great chemistry with Damon. Joe Pesci is a sad disappointment, as the trailers make it look like he is someone important, but he turns in barely a five minute cameo filled with preachy anti-Pesci dialogue.DeNiro's 'pet project' is an admirable work hindered by story and editing problems. The cast is top-notch for the most part, and despite its length, the film stays fairly interesting for the most part. A bit of a polish and more focus in certain areas instead of others could have only helped this film get the acknowledgment it should deserve.7/10.",7,2,3,29 December 2006
Music and Lyrics," It works for the most part, but is clearly not one of the best
","I am a big fan of Hugh Grant. I may not be the biggest fan of romantic comedies, but anything with him in it is usually something I would tend to watch. And after the absolutely grotesque spectacle that was American Dreamz, I was ready for just about anything to cleanse that god-awful taste out of my mouth. And even though Music and Lyrics is another film about the record industry, I think I am ready to forgive him.Grant stars as Alex Fletcher, an out of work 1980's pop singer who just happens to be one of singing sensation Cora Corman's (Haley Bennett) favourite artists. Needing a new single to complete her latest album, Corman gives Fletcher just over a few days to compose a brand new song, despite him not having written one in years. After a brief go with someone else, Fletcher finds his muse in his new plant lady, Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore), who just so happens to know how to write eloquently.Yes, it sounds rather lame, and just about anyone knows how the film will end, but that does not totally take away from the fun at play here.Grant is charming as always, even as a much older guy. He has really gotten to the point of perfection in understanding his romantic on-screen partners, and can really mesh in well against them. And even when you can tell he is not trying too hard, Grant still has a suspicious way of making it look like he is. And while he did genuinely attempt something different with Dreamz, you can see that this is where his heart lies, and probably where he is going to be stuck until he really breaks out as something more than the oft-spoken British guy in all of the romantic comedies everyone loves. But if that does not work out, I think he has quite a potential career in singing.Barrymore, another actor almost eternally cursed to this kind of role, also does well within it. She has some moments where she looks like she is lapsing into someone who is totally different from her character, but thankfully these only last for a few moments. She lights up the screen anytime she is front and centre alongside Grant, and even with unoriginal material, Barrymore makes something of her character and the film itself. She pales in comparison to Grant of course, but for someone who is not the quintessential romantic lead, she did pretty well for herself.Bennett in her tiny role is a bit bizarre, but was clearly written and acted on being someone who is just alien in her behaviour. To that, I think she does an adequate job, but she could have done better. If she really wanted to make herself out to be that much of a princess, she really should tried a lot less. She has a hell of a singing voice though.The only real bad apples here are Brad Garrett as Fletcher's manager Chris Riley, and Kristen Johnson as Sophie's sister Rhonda. I just have never liked Garrett, so maybe I am a bit bias when I call him a bad apple. But other than a few minor giggles, he really does nothing for the film. Hell, other than telling Fletcher about Corman wanting him to write a song, he basically does next to nothing. He would have just done better as a backdrop. Much goes the same for Johnson, who appears to have gotten another role written strictly for someone who resembles this bizarre person. I understand her rabid fanaticism, but there is a very thin line between comedy and annoyance. Johnson teeters on this line for the entirety of the film, and no matter what, she does not have the power to overcome any ridiculous stupidity this character acts out.As a film though, it tends to go on a bit too long. It could have done with a nice trim around the fattened middle, and this could have lead to a much faster and greater ending. As it stands, it falls into a few too many subplots that seem to want to put more influence on the characters than what is needed. I could have done with just minor background on Barrymore's character; I did not need to know as much as we end up being told. It just ends up feeling superfluous in the end, and drops the film down a few notches. If they really needed to keep it, I think they could have done it in a far more interesting way.But of course, I digress from my favourite part of the film  the opening scene. Mixing in Flock of Seagulls, Duran Duran and Wham!, the film opens with a music video from Fletcher's band PoP! that ends up being the perfect synergy of 1980's-style fads and 2007-style parodies. It works on so many levels that it almost overshadows the rest of the film. Everything is just pitch perfect, and if you did not realize that Hugh Grant was jumping around dressed as an 80's pop rocker, you probably could have mistaken it for the real thing. It is just that accurate, and clearly something everyone should watch whether they view the entirety of the film or not.On the whole, Music and Lyrics is a bit of a toss-up. On one hand, it has the immaculate Hugh Grant doing exactly what he does best, and being paired off with romantic comedy regular Drew Barrymore to boot. But on the other, it is flawed to the point of being superfluous in at least one section. For the most part, it works, and that should be enough for the majority of people watching it. But for any others, it can be used as a light snack, but not as a main course.7.5/10.",7,1,2,18 May 2007
The Queen," Interesting, and backed with a majestic performance from Mirren
","I was apprehensive about seeing The Queen when it first came out. Yeah, it had the Oscar buzz, but it really did not seem like it would be anything special. I had seen Capote the year before and almost fell asleep in the theatre with how boring it was, save for the earth-shattering performance from Phillip Seymour Hoffman. But with the continued buzz, I just could not help myself, and surprisingly, it was a whole lot better than I imagined it would be.Helen Mirren plays the titular role of Elizabeth II in the film which takes place in 1997. Following a short interlude in May during the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) to Prime Minister, the film quickly changes to August on the night of Princess Diana's death. The monarchy is visibly shaken up, but refuses to say anything to the equally shaken up British public. The film then chronicles the week leading up to Diana's funeral, and hypothetically plays out what happened during this time.While the movie is not perfect, it is much more than just a platform 'Oscar-gimme' for Mirren. The film is interesting and enlightening all at once in its depiction of the royal family. One would imagine it would be quite a spectacle behind closed doors, but they are played off to be just like every other family (of course, with a sprawlingly lengthy and beautiful backyard). The amazing photography and costume designs really pull forward the absolute majesty of the monarchy, and feel intensely authentic. I also liked how, even with the accents, the characters did not seem overly British. Some films really amp up the accent, but here, it is very low key, and barely noticeable. It was a nice change of pace, and made it not feel totally different like other foreign films. I also liked how the film made great use of archived newspapers and television broadcasts from the time. It helped make the film much more historically accurate, and allowed the film's events feel more recent than it is.The writing is note-worthy in how well it was done to produce a hypothetical story for what happened over those few days. It informs, while humouring the audience from time to time. The humanization of the royal family is not an easy task, but writer Peter Morgan really pulls through in how well his characters are written. Of course, it also packs in a bit too much action over this one week period. Some moments are totally worthwhile, while others just feel tacked on for no reason. It makes the film feel boring at times, and allows it to lose the edge it had going in. Other scenes are whip fast, and perfect in their length, so it really just feels like an issue that should have been dealt with during editing. A particular sequence involving Mirren and Sheen quickly jumps from a regular visit to see the Queen, to a total politically driven mockery of Tony Blair. It felt totally out of place, and more of just something to giggle at than something that actually was worth putting into the film.As pointed out already, Mirren is absolutely awe-inspiring in her role. Her look, mannerisms, body language and speech all look and sound exactly like the real Queen. She embodies her character much like Hoffman did Truman Capote, and she breathes life into an otherwise only momentarily interesting public figure. Her majesty and grace may look simple, but you can see just how much work she has put into the role to make it feel more than just believable. This is the kind of role that really shakes things up, and proves how well some actors can act on screen, and how much better she is than the majority of working actors today. I will say though, for all of the hype and amazement being placed on the role, she did not strike me as nearly astonishing as Hoffman or Jamie Foxx. She does a much better job than Charlize Theron did in Monster, but then again, Mirren's acting really has not changed all that drastically like Theron's did for her role.The supporting cast does a very amicable job in their roles, and again, are not completely pushed away by the majesty of Mirren. Sheen's spot-on performance of Tony Blair is particularly well done, and plays off wonderfully against Mirren and on his own. He has some genuine charisma in this role, and has just the right amount of timidness. Blair was fresh off of his election when Diana died, and you can see how well Sheen handles the daunting task of how he handled the situation being so new in office. James Cromwell also does pretty well for himself as Prince Phillip, as does Alex Jennings as Prince Charles (besides not totally looking all that much like Charles, particularly in his ears).It has some editing issues, but on the whole, The Queen is a whole lot better than what I expected. It is interesting, and has an excellent and award-worthy performance from Helen Mirren to back it up. Definitely one to check out.8/10.",8,0,0,17 January 2007
Iron Man," Downey Jr. is perfectly cast in a film that is better than expected
","There is really little to say about the plot of Iron Man that most people do not already know about. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is an obnoxiously wealthy CEO of a US weapons manufacturing company who is taken hostage in the remote mountains of Afghanistan. He manages to create an armoured suit he wears to escape his terrorist captors, and returns to the US a changed man.I was a little apprehensive getting hyped up over Iron Man. I was never a huge fan of the character, and with Jon Favreau at the wheel, it did not exactly sound like it was going to be as great as other comic book films like X2: X-Men United, Batman Begins or the Spider-Man sequels (my personal favourite remains Tim Burton's Batman from '89). But rather impressively, the film is much better than I think anyone could have expected.For one, Stark's characterization is a little more rounded than most. Much like Bruce Wayne, he is not really a superhero by the standard definition, but more someone who becomes one. He has the skeletons in the closet, he is a womanizing prick, and he's a border-line (if not full blown) alcoholic. He is not shown as in-depth as Batman was in Batman Begins, but the work put into his evolvement is much better than a typical comic book film.It also helps that Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Stark. I do not think anyone could have pulled him off anywhere near as well. He has just the right amount of cynicism, sarcasm and wit to make the character truly memorable. Any fan of the character, or anyone just looking for an actor putting in the work needed for his character to be believable should look no further. Downey Jr.'s own sketchy past only helps make his portrayal even more credible of someone living the high life, and then re-evaluating themselves and changing to be a better person. It almost speaks as a bit of a metaphor for his own journey, and makes his work here that much more personal. His wounded eyes speak volumes for him and the character.Unfortunately, as far as origin stories usually go, there is not a lot of room for the supporting characters to shine. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's assistant Pepper Potts, but Terrence Howard's Jim Rhodes is very much underused. We know of his importance to the story, but he never truly overcomes the flaw of just being a smarter and more successful tokin' black guy we all know from the years of stereotypes. He sets himself up for future installments, but I think his dialogue could have been fleshed out to be a little more useful than it is here. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane is another underused character, but Bridges manages to chew up a lot of scenery when he is on-screen. I think this may be his most involved and most fun performance since The Big Lebowski.The story itself is another great thing about the film, because it is nowhere near as far-fetched as most origin stories. While the creation of some of the more scientific elements may seem preposterous, its real world basis makes it miraculously relevant to the current war time events going on as we speak. This is a character who could only work after 9/11, and coming out now is probably the best move any studio could have ever made. Stark's story is one for this generation, and I think by not glossing anything over, the filmmakers have done justice to a character who cannot be any timelier. I also like that it focused a lot of attention on the meticulous work he does creating the suit, and showing his little failures along the way. The humour injected into a lot of scenes is also very well done.If anything at all, it could have used a bit of editing here and there however, shaving some time off in Afghanistan and the suit creations (as much as I liked them). Some of the dialogue is a little off as well (especially with Howard's character), and could have been tightened to better effect. I realize that these portrayals are based off comic book characters, but that does mean their dialogue automatically needs to be cheesy, or so silly that it needs to be funny.The special effects are another marvel, making the preposterous science elements seem even more real. Just watching the scene where Stark is trying out his suit's flying capabilities before creating the rest of the suit may be enough to make the film's imaginative structure look authentic. Yes, it does have a few moments where it looks fake and could have used more work, but for the most part, this may be the most fully rendered and realistic looking comic book character to date (in the realm of relying heavily on CGI of course).And as for Favreau, I was very impressed with the way the film handles itself. He truly kept it on the rails, and did not let its ambitiousness become too much for him. Yes, there are flaws, and yes, the film is imperfect. But for someone whose name I doubt could have ever been synonymous with creating action-orientated films before (not counting the family fantasy Zathura), Favreau has truly outdone himself. He has brought a complex character to the big screen, and has created one of the strongest comic book films to date. As I said earlier, I had my apprehensions, but his work here can only lead to bigger and better things.From its startling opening all the way up to its action infused finale, Iron Man is great film in every respect and one hell of a start for the summer movie season. It has its flaws, but the finesse of the story and the lead character make it truly memorable.8.5/10.",8,2,4,3 May 2008
Casino Royale," Pretty impressive, but far from perfect
","Sometime in 1996, I randomly rented a movie called Goldeneye. It turned out to be a really good movie and only after seeing it, did I find out that James Bond was actually a character in a long-running series. I became hooked on the series soon after. Being quite the fan, I was terribly disappointed by Die Another Day, but still loved Pierce Brosnan as Bond. So when Daniel Craig, an actor who has never impressed me at all, was signed on to play Bond in a remake of Casino Royale, I became a little disappointed right away. I saw it anyway, and to my surprise, was impressed for the most part.If I really go into the plot, I may ruin it, but suffice to say, the film is about James Bond's (Craig) first assignment as 007. After he botches the apprehension of a bomb-maker in Madagascar, he stumbles upon the code word 'Elipsis'. Not knowing what it means, he chases the leads, and eventually ends up at a fairly high stakes poker game at the titular casino, involving the obviously villainous gambling addict Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson).The film is not really deep at all, but it still does a good job. When they say that the film is darker and grittier, they really mean that it is just really violent. Die Another Day was plenty darker than this film. Same goes for the 'realism'. Yes, Bond takes a number of hard beatings throughout the film, but scenes like the fight in Madagascar near the beginning of the film are just as ridiculous as Bond films always have been. Not to say it is not well done or anything, but it is just as silly and over-the-top as one should expect. The film also contains the trademark cheesy dialogue, blatant sexual humour and badass one-liners from Bond himself. There are plenty of nods and homages to the earlier films as well (from Craig walking out of the ocean much akin to Ursula Andress in Dr. No, or his winning of a 1964 Aston Martin straight out of Goldfinger), and all are so successfully tucked into the film that only true Bond-philes will be able to pick up on them.As a Bond fan, I was quick to dismiss Craig as a bad pick for James Bond, but I was very impressed with how he pulled it off. Yes, he needs to work on the charm and charisma that made Sean Connery and Brosnan's portrayals so irresistibly cool, but his valiant first effort is very well done. He is convincing as the hero that we all know and love, and he does justice to the role. I did like seeing him actually make mistakes, and I did like seeing him not always win. The ego and rebel attitude he exhibits throughout the movie is very well performed, but as the film nears its finale, it becomes a little excessive. He is an amateur and the filmmakers just seem to want to drill us with this ideal until they are blue (like his way too prevalent eyes) in the face. I was still unsure about Craig during the film, but after finally hearing him say 'Bond, James Bond', I knew he was an alright pick.The supporting cast all do pretty well for themselves in their small roles. Mikkelson as Le Chiffre practically sizzles on screen, but is given far too little time to really develop. Same goes for Caterino Murino and Jeffrey Wright, who clearly look and feel underwritten. Judi Dench puts in another excellent performance as M, and it was great to see her finally letting loose in a few sequences. She was way too mellow in the last few films for her own good. Eva Green does great as Vesper Lynd, and despite some fairly inane dialogue, was great to see play off of Craig. She has just the right amount of attitude and sexiness for the role, and she never feels like she is getting too silly for her own good (unlike Halle Berry or Denise Richards just to name a few). She is a strong female character, and she holds her own against everyone else in the film, and does it with just the right amount of class that to be seen as a proper Bond girl.My only real problem with the film (other than a complete halt in the third that the film barely recovers from) is in the fact that it is contemporary. People are using cell phones, laptops, M is a girl, 9/11 and the war on terrorism are heavily prevalent themes. Now if this was not a really lengthy franchise, I would not have a huge issue. But after 20 films, they wanted to go back and redo it. Okay, that's fine. It worked for Batman Begins, and it worked for Superman Returns. But they left out things from the other films. Here, they seem to want us to just think that Bond randomly went from superstar double-0 agent, to a beginner within a four year span. It does not fit in right, and it sure as hell is never explained the way it should have been. It feels like a terribly awkward transition, and despite all of its greatness, makes the film really fall down a few notches. They could have at least set the film a few years ago, not in the present day. How is it supposed to jive continuity wise if there is better technology here than in any of the other films? In the end, the movie feels fresh, and is a definite step in the right direction for Bond. Now if only Craig can really grasp what it takes to truly be Bond in the next film and the filmmakers decide on how they want to make the film work against the others, will we truly get the Bond picture that we all really will praise.8/10.",8,1,3,17 November 2006
Toy Story 3," An emotional, nostalgic, and bittersweet ending to a legendary series
","Just under a year ago, Disney re-released Toy Story and Toy Story 2 as a 3D double bill in theatres. I had not seen either film in years despite owning them both on video and DVD, and never had the opportunity to see the sequel theatrically. So I jumped at the chance of seeing both films again. As the films progressed, I felt the nostalgia kicking in at every turn. Both were films that were released when I was still playing with toys, and both still managed to resonate with me now that I was grown up. They made me crave Toy Story 3 unlike any other film this summer, and after seeing Pixar's creative output in the past few years, is there any reason to why I should not have been hyped? Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen) and the gang (less a few members) are still in Andy's (John Morris) room despite having not been played with for years. Andy has gotten older, and has matured beyond his time playing with toys. They attempt to coax him into playing with them, but he has no time. He is moving away to college, and his mother wants him to pack what he is taking and get rid of the rest. She encourages donating the toys to a local daycare. While Woody is against the idea, everyone else is enthusiastic about being played with again. But after arriving at daycare (without Andy's knowledge), they change their minds quite quickly.Toy Story 3 is just as simplistic as the previous two films, and has the same main goal (return to Andy), but it feels like a much more mature and accomplished work on the part of the filmmakers. It was a wise choice to set the film so many years after Toy Story 2, not just because it has been that long since the film came out, but because it resonates with the audience on a level so much greater than anyone could expect. I mentioned my initial nostalgia when I re-watched the first two films a few months back. All those emotions and feelings came flooding back the moment Toy Story 3 began, and never faded away once. It only became greater as the film went on. And having seen the film in a packed theatre of young adults who were old enough to have seen the original two films when they were kids, I doubt I was the only one who felt this way.The film, much like last year's fantastically brilliant Up, is an adventure unlike any other. Pixar truly has the most creative minds working behind the scenes, and it shows in how wacky and imaginative this film is. It may play on similar themes from the past, but everything old manages to feel new again here. The film may not be as unique or wildly original as Up or WALL-E, but it still has the heart and charm these other Pixar films have. They really are the most consistent company currently making films, and it shows in their increasingly fascinating creative output.What takes away from the greatness and legacy of Toy Story 3 are the jumping tones. This was a problem Up handled quite well in how immediate and focused it was. But with Toy Story 3's increasingly expanding stable of characters and development of new characters like Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) and Ken (Michael Keaton), it becomes a little troublesome for the film's direction and tonal structure. It never becomes a distraction for the most part, but it comes off at times like Pixar is trying to cram too much into the film. I understand it is the last hurrah and the film that brings closure to this legendary series, but there could have been significantly more focus in some scenes. I have heard complaints about the nightmarish direction parts of the film takes, but this easily would not have been a problem had not begun weaving around in sections.But any problems the film has are forgiven by one of the most beautiful and bittersweet endings ever put to the format. It is so emotionally charged and so wonderful that you instantly forget anything you had against the film. If we had to suffer through some less than great scenes, they are all made up for in the ending. It speaks volumes for the franchise, and is almost heartbreaking to watch. I want to say more, but I fear for spoiling it for anyone who has yet to see the film. It is hard to not forge an emotional response to the finale, and you may need to sit through the wildly entertaining credits to regain your composure afterwards.As with every Pixar film, the voice acting and animation are incredible across the board. Listening to the likes of Hanks and Allen chatting again is like being in a room with old friends you have not seen in awhile, but have not changed at all since. New additions like Beatty, Keaton, Jeff Garlin and especially Timothy Dalton are all excellent as well. The animation is so precise and detailed to a level of perfection that only Pixar can give. The years away have only made these characters look even better than they ever have, and has given the backgrounds and human characters an even greater depth of realism. Not once does Pixar skimp on any detail in any instance.It is not the perfect picture on the whole that I wanted it to be, but Toy Story 3 is a great finale to the series and another great entry in the Pixar canon. What disappointment there is is immediately taken away by a touchingly beautiful finale. This is not Pixar at its finest hour, but it only further cements their status as the best studio in the business of animation, and film-making in general.9/10.",9,3,5,19 June 2010
Beowulf," Brilliantly bloody visuals do not automatically mean an amazing movie
","Beowulf.Everyone, or most people at least, remember encountering it in a high school English class. A lot remember the main story, and some, like me, slept right through most of the readings, and cannot fathom any idea about the story other than recalling the fight between the heroic Beowulf and the monster Grendel.So in a way, it really does not help my case that the new film, tinkers and reinvents the legendary poem into something a little clearer and more tangible. While the key events are present within the film, it does change quite a few things within the mythical poem, but does stay fairly within the realm of the idea of what happens to Beowulf (Ray Winstone) after he fights Grendel (Crispin Glover).Looking beyond the fact that the film is based on material written originally in Old English, the film stands out as a bit of a mishmash of ideas and concepts based in the initial text, but also based around the style of epic film-making. For one, it really brings a sense of age to the screen. The viewer can easily get a sense of similarity between this film and the likes of The Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, even the recent 300. It just does not feel entirely fresh in the aspect of it staying within the ancient European epic genre. It also falters in the dialogue. It frequently shifts between using Old English style wordings, to normal modern wordings, to just throwing in random pieces of comedy for no reason (and sequences designed specifically to incite laughter alongside them). The material is clearly brooding with darkness and cynicism, was there really a reason to make light jokes at the expense of the kids watching it? Do the majority ruling adults have no say? It jumps around for the entirety of the running time in this manner, and at times, becomes downright bothersome (hell, Grendel only speaks in Old English).There has been plenty of publicity about Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary's long road to getting the film made, and it really brings to light the reasoning behind the ill-placed light hearted sequences. It just does not feel like it is a fully cohesive piece. The tone is never steady, and if it is not trying to catch some laughs, the dialogue comes off at times as being ridiculously overacted and silly. How can anyone assume they are in for a hell of ride if you cannot even get past some of the horrible deliveries? Continuing on that same idea, the characters themselves are not much better. With the exception of Beowulf, Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and maybe Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), none of the characters are fully described or are even given some sort of backstory. We are subjected to this over and over, and never does it seem like the film is making a genuine attempt at even trying to cloak the idea that the characters are written so poorly. Some are given small doses of influence and motivation (like Grendel and even Unferth (John Malkovich)), but even then the characters seem very grounded in their ideas and style. It even gets to the point that when they talk, they just bring the entire movie down into sheer boredom (even with the stunning credit list of supporting actors). Incite and intrigue seemed to be the last thing on anyone's mind when they were actually creating the film. For the most part, the actors do look like they are trying, it just does not look like they are doing too much.Winstone, as the lead, is a lot like the tone and design of the writing on the film. He truly shows off his talents as an actor in one scene, and then wavers into an uncontrollable mess of a character in the next. There is no balance whatsoever when he appears on screen in these scenes, and it brings to mind the question of how a true hero really should act. Winstone nails the lines, and the body language, but he just does not have the zest to carry the film in the direction it needs to go.What does carry are the visuals. Absolutely immaculate in their design and near flawless, these are some of the best CGI scenes ever put to celluloid. By using motion capture technology, director Robert Zemeckis and his crew have put together characters that look, move and sound like the real thing. You can see the shade in all of the characters (and mythical creatures) that suggests that they are animated, but every other moment it is a bit more difficult to notice that the actors are animated.. The most minuscule physical details are corrected meticulously for every character, even the disgustingly deformed Grendel (who looks astonishingly realistic, and may just be the ticket to an Oscar come February). Just examining the beard Beowulf has exhibits millions of tiny hairs and blazingly realistic wrinkles. No CGI character (save for Gollum, Kong and Jar Jar) has ever been so completely and minutely realistic as the characters are in this film. I just wish liquids looked nearly as good as the actors and the backgrounds.What is also interesting is the aging and weight loss given during the film. Winstone is a big guy, but you would never know because he is rather chiselled and athletic in this movie. And when he ages by fifty years, you can see no difference in the character other than the age. It is absolutely awestriking to watch and if for any reason to see the movie immediately, it would be that.The film is not perfect by any means, but Beowulf is a valiant try at capturing an epic poem that is practically untranslatable. See it for the visuals, not the incomplete story.7/10.",7,3,12,17 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Issues aside, twelve years has done a worthy amount of good for John McClane
","Being a Die Hard fan, I was a bit skeptical about a new sequel coming almost twelve years after the last one. Everything has changed so much, and Bruce Willis has done very little since, and it just did not seem like that great of an idea to resurrect John McClane after so long. But as the trailers and the publicity machine started to unpackage itself, I got pretty excited for it. The PG-13 rating put a little damper on my enthusiasm for seeing the film (after all, the same thing happened with Alien vs. Predator a few years back, and look how atrocious that film was), but I pressed on, hoping for the best.As Live Free or Die Hard opens, a group of cyber-technologists is rounding up some of America's hackers to write codes for them. Soon after, the technologists (now clearly cyber terrorists) hack into the FBI mainframe, setting off a red flag for the Feds. They ask for senior law enforcement officials around the country to pick up the most renowned hackers, and John McClane (Willis) just happens to be called on to pick up Matt Farrell (Justin Long). As he does, a hit squad is sent to kill Farrell, and McClane of course, saves him. Not knowing the purpose of the pick-up, McClane is soon thrust into a plot that could completely obliterate any ground the United States has created for themselves after 9/11.Yeah, it sounds like a bit much for a Die Hard movie, but it most definitely pays off.To start, Live Free or Die Hard truly is a Die Hard film, despite the change in rating. McClane is still a wise-ass cracking jokes and taking out bad guys at every turn. Even after the absence, Willis still has just enough finesse to pull off the role that made him a star almost twenty years ago. He may have aged, but this is still the McClane everyone remembers. Yes, his signature line does get cut rather abruptly, but he still provides just enough kicks for the audience to remember why the character was so popular to begin with.As well, the action does not let up for much of the movie. I was afraid that the rating meant they had to sacrifice some of the more intense and violent scenery known to the series, but thankfully, it remains intact and just as strong as ever. Thrilling sequences abound throughout the movie (although the trailers do a bit too much of a revealing of one of the best ones), and all are well choreographed and edited onto screen. The use of CGI is apparent, but thanks to some of the clever editing, it is few and far between, making the action look more realistic and energized than ever before.The story, while seemingly better thought out than other long-awaited sequels like Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, is far fetched. There are a lot of points that will either make you truly question the realism, and some that just feel tacky and ridiculous. The terrorist threat, no matter how frightening it may sound, has more than a handful of problems in its execution. But nonetheless, the filmmakers do valiantly try their best with the material, and for the most part, do fairly well with it. I did indeed enjoy a lot of the ideas brought to the table during the film, but not all of them gel together like they should.What also does not work is the padding the film gets between the action sequences. The action is fast and furious, but when the story is being fleshed out, there were more than a few instances where the film just slows to a halt. I like the little character moments the previous three films offered, but here, they really do not do a lot for any of the characters. The extra material is obvious for McClane and helps make his older character seem a lot more useful than he should be, but the fleshing out of the likes of his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the main villain, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), do nothing for their characters. They still seem one-dimensional even as true character-building moments come and go. Their lifeless expressions and dull performances say it all. It is a bit bizarre, but it really damages the smaller character importance the other three films carried.Long on the other hand, delivers a worthwhile performance as Farrell, and offers some genuine counter-programming to Willis' hard-assedness. He is nowhere near as strong a 'sidekick' as the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, but he does well for himself anyway. Supporting performances from Maggie Q, Cliff Curtis and the intriguingly well-placed Kevin Smith are all very well done for their small amount of time on-screen.For all of my liking of the return of McClane, and the balls-to-the-wall action sequences, I feel a small shudder of disappointment in the editing. While much of it is very well done, it is almost blatantly obvious where certain scenes have been stripped of their violence and language. Yes, a surprising amount of both appear on-screen (McClane would not be McClane if he was not covered in blood and not using profuse swearing), but a few moments appear where you can clearly see the words not matching the actor's lips, or where there looks to be more of a scene then there is. It is inevitable that the film will have an R-rated or Unrated DVD, but to make it so blatantly obvious during the film, just stinks of bad film-making.Editing and character issues aside, Live Free or Die Hard is a solid action flick and a worthy predecessor to the Die Hard name. Anyone who has doubts about it living up to its name will be glad to hear that twelve years of absence has done John McClane good.7.5/10.",7,1,3,30 June 2007
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A breathtaking finale to an amazing series
","Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.Picking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off, the film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul. Rather quickly, it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts, and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community, and the world at large, begins.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always, it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision, but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good, and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene. Grint, Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters, and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here, they have totally immersed themselves into their roles, and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book, and move from sadness, to courageous, to fearful, and more, with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong, and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from. Even with their varying screen times, the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall, as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (who gets the greatest line in the film). Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, George Harris, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters, and help deliver awesome performances all around.But the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point, Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series, and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation, and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name, courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious, Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.But like all Harry Potter films however, the cohesive product is not without its faults.My main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts, it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film. Much like the extended and excruciatingly long camping trip from the first half, the second half gets dragged down by the addition of standout moments from the book that felt awful the first time you read them, and come off even worse on the screen. I know they are pandering to the audience, and adding just as much as they possibly could to make the film feel complete, but there was a reason so much was cut out of the other books when they made the leap to the big screen. This is the shortest of the saga by a long shot, and the chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out.My other gripe is the 3D. The filmmakers said they did not have the right amount of time to convert the first half properly, so they just scrapped the plans. The movie looked amazing anyway, and I found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been three-dimensional about it about the second part. Save for a scene early on involving a rather badly rendered dragon, there is not much else that takes advantage of the added 3D. The majority of the film just looks and acts normal, never exploring the format, and never giving the audience a reason to care or change their minds on the quickly dying trend. In what feels like a blink of the eye, the Harry Potter film series is over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has arrived, and with it, an incredible end to the franchise. It stumbles in some places because of the inane and disappointing prose of the book, but the filmmakers have stayed true to their book and film fans, and delivered a tremendously worthy finale. It is one of the strongest films of the year, and one of the best film finales ever conceived. 8.5/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",8,48,70,31 July 2011
Munich," A fantastic, yet flawed masterwork from a master auteur.
","I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was blown away by this haunting, yet flawed masterpiece. And afterwords, I can tell that Steve's theme for this year was murder and absolutely abolishing all human life.You can tell from the opening frame, that you're in the hands of a masterful director. He recreates the brutal sequence of events during the 1972 Olympic Crisis, and does it brilliantly. And he even doesn't give you the whole thing in one shot, but makes you crave to see it more and more. And the addition of all the newscast footage from the actual crisis was a nice touch too.Bana puts in an awe-striking performance as Avner, and is still showing off the talent he's been showing since the start of his career (a saving grace in Troy, and great in The Hulk). Everyone else who pops up during the film, does a great job in their role as well, but are clearly overshadowed by Bana's brilliant performance. Craig is alright too, but still nothing amazing.The cinematography and overall story is gritty and amazing. The entire film, all 163 minutes, are nothing short of intense. People are dying, people are scared, there is all sorts of uncertainty on tops of mountains of blood, and the scenes from the crisis just keep coming up at just the right moments. Again, you can tell the handwork of a skilled director in Spielberg. His dedication to the subject matter, and his blatant attempt at showing the real message of the horror of terrorism and revenge, is evident in all the blood soaked frames.The special effects up the realism aspect of the film, and when it gets loud, the sound really starts thumping. And speaking of blood, damn, there's a lot of it. And much more than I ever expected. Yes, I forget most of Saving Private Ryan, minus the D-Day sequence, but this film is just soaking in it.If there would be any problem, it would be the fact that some pieces of explanation are missing, or just hinted at, and leave you staring asking yourself 'Who/What was that about?' Yes, some movies don't need to spell it all right out for you, but some of it just left me dumbfounded, asking more questions than needed. And the film could have benefited with the removal of about 10-15 minutes. Some of the stuff drags a bit, even if you can't take your eyes off it. The sex scene near the end, intertwined with the final pieces of the Munich massacre just seemed inappropriate and silly (the sweat going everywhere in slow motion was bizarre as well).In the end, a flawed masterwork, and Spielberg's best work since Ryan. And yes, it does more than make up for the fact that War of the Worlds sucked.It was a nice touch to see the WTC in the skyline too, even if it brings in a whole whack-load of overall messages that should be taken from the movie.9/10.",9,3,6,8 January 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The beginning of the franchise, and the early suggestion of problems with it.
","I'll hand it to Wes Craven.He can construct a fairly original story, and throw in just the right amount of scary twists at us to keep us watching. Even with being 22 years old, Nightmare still smells and looks fresh (save for some of the items that have been updated since). The idea of having someone take your life in your dreams is just an interesting one that has yet to be done as well, if at all, since the franchise's run during the 1980's. The death sequences are imaginative, and make others pale in comparison. This movie was popular at the time for a reason (and gave Johnny Depp a name as well). They are all done very well done for 1984, especially considering they all would be benefiting from the help of CGI if the movie was remade today.Another interesting thing to note, is how the characters aren't dumb like the casts in their horror film brother and sisters (read: Friday the 13th). They genuinely have no idea what's going on with their dreams, and the Freddy Kreuger cover-up only adds to this fact. They attempt to avert the inevitable, but just end up failing. Whereas most horror just have the characters being complete morons, and walking right into their fates with no chance of thinking before hand. The heroine in this picture genuinely has ideas for what to do, and fights to try and get them to work. She is the one who set the cliché up for future generations of horror films, and you can just see the beauty of the original idea playing out in the movie. And while Kreuger had yet to become the smart-ass he was in other films, his creepy presence only adds to the genuine scares of the film (and he is pretty witty in some instances).The problem with the film is how the film falls apart after it all sets up completely. The entirety of the final 30 minutes of the film are just silly, and do no justice to the rest of the film. The ending is absolutely awful, and makes the clichés of today look absolutely brilliant. It looks entirely half-baked, and too well appreciated for its own good. It had the makings for something that really should continue to live on in 2006, and just dissolved faster than it was made. It just stops making sense. Yes, you need to have an open mind, and just let the movie play out without using your brain, but if you're left sitting there completely not understanding one thing that just happened, what kind of payoff is that?Craven had created a great horror film, and simply, he just didn't know how to make it play out. A number of things could have been done to make his status even greater than it was after this, and one is definitely to allow it to make sense.Adding more sense to the finale of the picture would have benefited greatly, in 1984 or in 2006. It would have added so much more to this memorable film, and really made the sequels pale in comparison. I will say though, it was a hell of a way to make a name for yourself Craven.7/10.",7,0,0,6 April 2006
Heat," Has potential, but is far too long
","About ten years ago, I sat and watched Heat with my family. Despite the three hour runtime, I was the only one who managed to sit through the entire thing without falling asleep. At the end of it, I really did not like it at all. I thought it was overly boring, and ran for way too long. My vast film knowledge was not even a fraction of what it is today at that point, but for years to come, if anyone ever asked if I had seen it, I said the same thing to them. So in the last two years, I've caught various parts of it, and was totally immersed within the film, despite my previous ideals about it. I never managed to watch it beginning to end at any point (usually just the same parts over and over), so I finally decided to crack down and watch it.Heat runs along the lines of a parallel story between two characters: Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) and Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro). Hanna is a Liutenant with the LAPD, and basically spends his life tracking down and arresting criminals. His social life is totally absent, and it shows with the frustration his third wife Justine (Diane Venora), has with him. McCauley is a skilled thief, who is hired on various jobs with his crew, and lives by a very straight, and by-the-books lifestyle. He consistently delivers lines about being able to walk away from anything if any situation was to come up. For that reason, his social life is a mess too.Both are basically the same conflicted character, just on two sides of the law.With the film running for three hours though, you can tell that this is just a very basic idea of what the film is about. It is littered with dozens of subplots involving secondary characters, and even deeper subplots with the main characters. It seemingly goes on and on, until it finally meets the ending, which never seems to come soon enough.While DeNiro is his usual great acting self here, there was something about Pacino that was just, not right. Watching the film, I could never figure out just what it was, but it was so easily noticeable that it was not on the same level as his performances in Scent of a Woman, The Godfather or Scarface. He's a great, versatile actor, and he's undoubtedly one of the greatest of the last thirty to forty years. But something just does not click here the same as it does with DeNiro. Of course, DeNiro's performance does not rank up there with the likes of Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, but it is still much better overall than Pacino's.The supporting cast which features Venora, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight and Tom Sizemore among others, are all just good. None of them really stand out performance wise, and none of them stand out as even close to matching anything that DeNiro puts forth (or Pacino for that matter). They are secondary to the two big actors, and they know it. They follow Michael Mann's writing to the tee, and make little to no progression in making their characters any greater than they can be.As said, Mann's script and direction really hurts this film. It is too long. Easily, a whole thirty minutes could have been excised right from the film, and it still could have had potential for greatness. Collateral was a straight two hours, and felt brisk, yet got so much accomplished. Why could this 'saga' not have been so much more tightly packed in? The layers of subplots really damage the film and its impact, and really damages any sort of astonishing acting to be done. The audience is bored, and so are the actors. Is that not obvious Mann?But I will admit, the film has some fabulously choreographed sequences. The LA street shootout between the thieves and the cops is just astonishing. That one scene I mentioned above that I kept continually seeing? This was it. And watching it within the film really made me feel how sad it was to see such a great scene come so long after the lengthy scenes before it. It looks and sounds amazing. The cinematography within the scene is top notch, and is so well paced, that you have to ask yourself why the rest of the film was not done nearly as well. Yes, the film has a variety of other top-notch shots and visuals, but some are just overkill. And others are just unneeded. It was almost like Mann really wanted to make this film continue on forever, and try and throw some of his excellent style in to try and make up for it.Sorry to say, but it just does not help the film in the end.While some films have gotten better since I first watched them years ago, others have not changed. This film, sadly, is one of them. It has great potential, and some great sequences, but it just does not know well enough as to when it should stop. It's too long, and it has way too much going on in it for it's own good. It's not a bad film for this reason, but it's not an amazing one either.7/10.",7,0,3,23 May 2006
Footloose," Not as awful as it could have been, but not overly great either
","I enjoy bad movies, and enjoy bad remakes even more. So when the opportunity to get advanced passes to the atrocious looking remake of Footloose came, I pounced on them just out of the sheer will to see what kind of monstrosity Craig Brewer and company came up with. The film had gone through a number of changes, and had plenty of room to improve on the original. Sadly, I do not think there was ever any hope for it.After a horrific accident takes the lives of five high school seniors, the town of Bomont, Tennessee outlaws a number of activities for the teenage populace including dancing. Enter Ren McCormack (Kenny Wormald), a city kid and distinct outsider to the close knit Bomont townspeople. He is confused by the bans, and after making a few new friends, sets out to get them abolished.While the nostalgia factor may cloud the memories of some people, the original Footloose is really nothing more than a fun diversion packed alongside an absolutely infectious soundtrack that is still great even today. It is a fairly silly film really, but with the help of Kevin Bacon's 1984-era charm and charisma, the film remains a wildly enjoyable film. Yet somehow, in remaking the film for an audience in 2011, it seems like the filmmakers missed more than a few steps along the way.Now I will be the first to admit that this new remake does have a handful of fun scenes and astonishing dance choreography. The trailers do a good job of showing off just how great some of the dance moves are from this new cast, but what it does not let on too much is that most of these scenes come when they are replicating scenes from the original film. I basked in the glory of hearing Kenny Loggins blasting, while watching the various pairs of feet dancing to the beat. And seeing Willard (Miles Teller) learning how to dance is one of the highlights of the film, much like it is the original film. A key dance sequence late in the film is also significantly better than I could have ever predicted.But that is where the enjoyment ends. The rest of the film that surrounds these scenes is dull and lifeless, moving at a snail's pace and just going through the motions. There is very little fun to be had, and should someone venture into the film without having seen the original, they may wonder why anyone wanted to remake it in the first place. Instead of trying to improve and make the plot line less ludicrous, the filmmakers left the entire crux of the film the exact same. They merely changed a few character traits around, shuffled in some racy dialogue, and took out the tractors and added in school buses. They sucked out all the fun, and what is left seems like a mere project that was cranked out with little to no thought for what audiences may actually perceive to be enjoyable.Worse yet, the soundtrack is a totally forgettable affair. While it is the crucial element of the original film, it feels like a largely laughable affair here. I was originally intrigued at the idea of the film containing all the original songs, albeit covered by new artists. But somehow, all of the catchiness of the original tunes seems to have been stripped from these new ones. Instead, we are left with versions that have a country twang or overtly urban feel to them, and absolutely no reason to want to listen to these new versions ever again. I would be lying if I did not think the most memorable tracks in the film were the two original ones that somehow were deemed okay to fit into the film. I would register a guess that this is the influence of Brewer, who is best known for Hustle & Flow and Black Snake Moan. He has a distinctly Southern taste to his body of work, and practically forces it on this film. But in forcing this ideology, alongside two completely different genres of music, he crushes the film into submission, leaving many scenes an absolute mess. The acting in the film is even more disappointing. Dennis Quaid looks embarrassed in every scene he is in, overacting as much as he possibly can to forget that he is in the film. Andie McDowell looks like she wandered in off the wrong set, and just decided to stick around as a background character. Wormald is a poor substitute for Bacon, and is an even worse lead for a major motion picture. I realize he is a dancer first and foremost, but leaving him to carry this film was an awful decision. He looks frightened and confused for the majority of the film, and quivers through most of his lines. He lacks Ren's charm, and is never believable when he rebels against authority. You want to believe in this character, but all you will do is laugh at how staggeringly bad Wormald's performance is. Julianne Hough, the female lead, at least attempts to act. She comes close to a breakthrough in more than one instance, but she comes off a bit too amateur for her own good. She makes a great dance partner for Wormald, but for what little shred of chemistry she has, it is made totally moot when he opens his mouth. What redeems the film from being the awful travesty it should be is Teller's performance as Willard. The moment he walks on-screen, he has an energy to him that is simply unmatchable. He is the single best thing about the film, embodying the innocence, spirit and fun of Chris Penn's original performance. If you venture into this remake, see it for him and ignore the rest. You may find some remotely enjoyable experience buried in there somewhere.4/10.",4,91,126,2 October 2011
300," The anti-epic for the hard rock generation
","From the moment I heard that 300 was based on a Frank Miller graphic novel, I was hooked. I absolutely adored every minute of Frank Miller's Sin City, and liked it even more after I read all 7 graphic novels. So despite not reading the 300 graphic novel, I was still very hooked on the idea, and heavily anticipated the movie. And I was not all that disappointed with the final result.300 is a heavily stylized version of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. To stop the advancing Persian army hellbent on ruling the Greek nation of Sparta, King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) brings 299 of his best men to fight against them. Despite having no real permission from Sparta's elders, Leonidas goes into battle anyway, as his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), attempts to bargain and get more men to fight alongside him.Despite being epic in its scale, 300 feels like anything but. Everything is so stylized and completely otherworldly that anyone hoping to come and get a history lesson or something in vein of Troy or Alexander is sadly looking in the wrong place. It is more of an anti-epic, and is significantly shorter than any film like those mentioned.All of the scenes are played out in obvious CGI, allowing the scenery to take on a whole life of its own. Much like Sin City before it, everything looks real enough, but clearly looks to be computer animated. It brings a certain element of the graphic novel to life, and allows it to feel more original and not so comparative to those other ancient Greek-style epics. The colours used in the scenes, the backgrounds and on the characters themselves also look very graphic novel-esquire, and all add to how stylish and unique the film looks, particularly scenes that take place at night-time or just after a huge battle.Speaking of battles, all of them are well choreographed and brought to life on screen. Slow motion sequences are frequently put to work here, and they only help to add to how amazingly choreographed and orchestrated the battle scenes are. Just watching these men fight so valiantly is an experience on its own. It is almost like it is a form of dance, coming to life right before our eyes. A dance of course, that is saturated in blood. It flows heavily and fluently throughout the picture, from the days of Leonidas youthful training, and well into every battle. It becomes so red when it flows in certain scenes that it almost turns black as it flies in the wind. Despite it being gratuitous in many areas, it was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be. This may be as a result of it being all CGI-created (which makes for more blood flying through the air than landing on the ground), but it may just be that my appetite for graphic violence is more than should be expected.Without ruining anything, some of the creatures and monsters that show up during some of these battles are also very cool looking in their uniqueness. They show mere glimpses of them in the trailers, but when they show up on screen, they feel like they are almost completely different in the way they look and act.Another interesting aspect of the film is the use of music. In some scenes, the music pounds in epic opera tones, really stretching for how the film looks as opposed to how it plays out. It works very well, and allows it to feel more at home with the more contemporary epics. But unlike those epics, it blends right into the hard rock that plays throughout the majority of the battle scenes. It pounds and smashes almost at the same speed and veracity as these Spartans and Persians are battling. It is definitely something I was expecting from the trailers, but not something I expected to work so well during these scenes of hyper violence.Butler does a great job carrying the film. He has an obvious presence from the moment he enters the film, and he just hands on with a great amount of strength throughout. Listening to him blare out Miller's poetic writing only continues to perpetuate how different the film is from other historical epics. David Wenham, Vincent Regan and the rest of the actors playing Spartan soldiers hold up to him greatly, and really do a good job at it (bringing in a lot of humour along with Butler throughout the film). Headey surprised me in how much intensity she brings to her role. She is strong-willed from the start and acts like she is almost a soldier herself. Dominic West and Rodrigo Santoro are okay in their roles, but they do not get nearly enough time to really sink their teeth into their roles.If there is anything wrong with the film, it is in just how much style is brought into the film. It looks great when it starts, but watching almost every scene in slow motion becomes a little dull after awhile. Thankfully, many of these scenes are all different in how they are conveyed, but it still does not make up for just how much slow motion is used. I also think that it was slow in certain areas, but really quick in others. It felt like it could have been trimmed down a bit more than it already was, and could have been a whole lot faster paced as a result. It also lacks the spark that made Sin City such a beautiful film, but is more than a worthy successor.While it has a few issues, 300 is the first great film of 2007 and no doubt, will have an impact on its viewers. It is a bloody good time, and has just enough uniqueness to set it apart from other epic-style films.9/10.",9,8,19,9 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Watchable, but only barely.
","I wanted to like this movie. I did. Yes, I knew it was supposed to be fairly bad, but I still wanted to enjoy it. And really, you can't, because it's a terribly flawed movie. The dialog is silly. The special effects are good in small doses, especially for when the Human Torch is doing his thing. But when Mr. Fantastic starts stretching? Get ready for something horrendous. The Thing is clearly too short to really be the Thing (I don't care if Vic Mackey wanted no CGI or not), and the story really has a rough time trying to make us feel for him. His wife just gets up and leaves, no question? What the hell? And then they try to humanize him more with the blind black chick, only to have her on screen for a total of 5 minutes? Come on.The acting is alright, and unfortunately the only person who could really do anything was Chris Evans, since he gets all the best dialog in the movie, and clearly is a great choice for Johnny Storm. Everyone else just gets stuff modest at best.What really makes the movie all the worse however, is the fact that a lot of it is too comedic for its own good. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies work because they have just the right dose of comedy, camp, action and realism. Fantastic 4 has far too much comedy, not enough action, next to no realism, and gets campy way too often. But that's what they get for getting the director of Barbershop to do this.And oh Jesus, I haven't gotten to the best part: Jessica Alba in some of the worst casting in history. She is not Sue Storm. While there may be problems with the rest of the casting, this is just unspeakable. You can't help this choice at all. She's no scientist, and she barely works as anything else either, let alone as the Invisible Woman. It becomes obvious that she's only there for eye candy when she randomly strips during the bridge sequence to help move attention away from The Thing. For one, she's wearing a thong (I'll make a slight assumption here, but doing all that work in the lab all day really helps me figure scientists do not wear thongs), and she's Jessica Alba. She worked as a stripper in Frank Miller's Sin City, but there, she wasn't brainy, and wasn't a real amazing person there. She's supposed to be here...and isn't. Go back to your day job as the sex appeal honey.But is it watchable? Yes, but only barely. The story is still there, and the whole hype of the media fascination with them is something that is only half explained in other comic book films (I want more of J. Jonah Jameson Raimi!), and is more touched on here. Plus, some of the things that really don't work, are given some time to try throughout the film. And come on, the cameo by Stan Lee is enough for people to see it. And it was definitely amusing to see both Ben Mulroney and Maria Menunos showing up.A good polish of the script, less comedy, better casting, and nicer CGI would have made this a worthy contender for a good comic book movie. But unfortunately, has to sit it out and wait for the sequel in order to even potentially be thought of as 'great'. 5.5/10.",5,0,2,4 January 2006
Click," One of the worst excuses for a movie I have ever seen
","I used to genuinely enjoy watching Adam Sandler films. He was a funny guy, and his movies showcased this talent of his off rather well. But I would imagine, after hitting a high with Big Daddy, either the quality of the films started to wear off, or Sandler just got too big for his britches. With the exception of Punch Drunk Love (an entirely different kind of role altogether) and to a lesser extent, Spanglish, I have yet to see Sandler actually pull off a massively hilarious or worthwhile comedy ever since. And Click sadly, is not exception.Sandler plays Michael Newman, a family man obsessed with work to the point that he has next to no time to spend with his family. Not quite understanding the remotes in his house, Michael sets out one evening to get a universal remote to help him better function with the electronics in his house. But upon meeting Morty (Christopher Walken) in the 'Way Beyond' section of Bed, Bath and Beyond (that would have been clever about ten years ago), he receives much more than just a universal remote. With just a click of a button, Michael can rewind, fast-forward or skip out on certain moments in his life. But things can only go so good for so long.Simply put, Click is one of the worst excuses for a comedy/drama that I have ever seen. Not once does the film even remotely attempt to bring anything new to the tired and overused idea at work within the film, and never once does it even attempt to revel in the genre that it belongs in. The movie just plays out at break-neck speed, beginning and ending without much in-between. And when moments of comedy come up, they speed by and either hit the mark or miss it entirely (the latter happens a whole lot more often than the former). And when moments of drama come up, they are either eluded to as still being subtly funny, or just come off as plainly amateur. The actors within the film are clearly better trained than the material, but despite this, it still acts as a barrier limiting their every move.And no one is held back more than Sandler himself. He just does not seem to know what he is doing here, or how he should be doing it. Should he be acting like a goof, and just creating laughs for the audience at every turn? Or should he actually be a genuinely affected individual, who is slowly seeing the dramatic consequences of his every action, and is ultimately being destroyed by it? He just does not seem to understand at any point during the film, and of the mere moments where he shows a brief glimpse of the actor that was born in Punch Drunk Love, they still do not seem to cut it. He just comes off as being annoying for the most part, and when he is acting with his puppy dog-style 'Woe is me!' look, he just comes off as being useless. It is almost as if he does not even bother trying anymore to create something that will genuinely affect people. If he thinks the adolescent attempt at tear-inducing drama that takes place in final act of the film was actually something worthwhile, I think he needs to start getting some better career advice.What is even more sad is the staple of actors the film has at its disposal, who are all criminally underused. Kate Beckinsale plays Sandler's wife, and all she basically gets to do is get naughty with him, or argue with him. She may be credited second only to Sandler, but she gets such a tiny amount of screen time that you wonder why the filmmakers even bothered getting a name actor, and not just some random good looking extra. Henry Winkler and David Hasselhoff, both wonderful character actors (even if a lot of their best stuff is mere parodies of their most famous roles), are basically used as stepping stones for Sandler jokes that do nothing for the movie. The entire scene where he pauses his life and beats up Hasselhoff is not funny. It borders on being delusionally ridiculous. They do get a few funny lines, but are nothing but mere cardboard cut-outs for the most part.Walken is the one who fares the greatest of anyone, but only by mere chance. He plays Morty as the usual kooky/crazy Walken stereotype, and it only works because it is funnier than almost anything Sandler can throw at the audience. I found myself pining for more Walken, just because everything else was so ridiculously unfunny. Even at his worst, Walken still succeeds in being better than everything in the entirety of the movie.The only thing that can even match him is some of the interesting make-up that appears in the last half of the movie. Not so much Sandler dressed up as a fat guy (especially not during the horrendously CGI-friendly 'wake-up' scene), but the aging done to the likes of Winkler, Beckinsale, Sean Astin and Julie Kavner. I thought it would look silly, but it was actually well done, and clearly was well thought out and applied in its creation. It actually makes these moments seem better than they actually are, just because of how professionally done they look. It was a treat to see the wonders of some of these scenes, and really begged the question of whether the movie could have actually been better if it was as well thought out as the make-up.It pains me to know Sandler actually made people genuinely cry with some of the material in this film. I felt like crying yes, but only because of how atrocious the things going on on-screen were. I can only hope that there are a few more Punch Drunk Loves coming from Sandler, and no more disasters like this.2/10.",2,7,15,22 August 2007
Pineapple Express," A great throwback to the 1980's buddy action flick
","After an impromptu, albeit hilarious, history lesson, Pineapple Express jumps into telling us the story of Dale Denton (Seth Rogen), a process server who loves to smoke marijuana at any time of day. His dealer, Saul (James Franco), is only happy to further provide him with his drug habit. On a routine call for his job, Dale witnesses a murder at the home of Ted Jones (Gary Cole). Having nowhere else to run, he turns to Saul, open to end up on the run from Jones' men.After being disappointed with Step Brothers, I was not sure if I should really getting excited for Pineapple Express. It was from the master of comedy himself, Judd Apatow, and starred and was co-written by his golden boy, Rogen. It sounded like more of a sure thing, and for the most part, it turned out to be.I was a little surprised, but for all the film is made out to be a stoner comedy, it is actually more in vein with a buddy action flick from the 1980's. There are explosions, gratuitous violence (a lot more than I ever could have expected), a car chase, fight scenes and plenty of one-liners. Some may write it off as a spoof of these flicks, but unlike the recent Apatow-driven Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Pineapple Express is its own near original idea. It embraces the conventions of the genre, and turns them on their head by making the two main characters potheads who are high off and on for most of the movie.The sheer silliness of that idea is what makes the film work. The characters Rogen and Franco play are the complete opposite of any character we have seen in similar situations before. They talk and act frantic, and when it comes down to business, they look terrified taking part in any thing that happens. While the script does not seem to be as improvised as past Apatowian films, it seems to allow these two the freedom to make complete goofs of themselves but still seem serious enough to lead this kind of movie.The script itself is not perfect by any means. It leaves a lot of loose ends, and packs itself down, leaving some supporting characters very little to do. Rather surprisingly, it does not offer the same amount of laughs as Step Brothers had either. Whether this is because some of the action set pieces are more thrilling than they are funny, or that the lines are not as ridiculously improvised left the film missing out is unclear. But fortunately, it does include an intriguing storyline that works as a cohesive whole, and ties together some key drug related themes, and even manages to include some morality too. It runs a little lengthy (as expected), and much of the added weight seems to be in the form of Rogen's scenes alongside his character's high school-aged girlfriend, Angie (Amber Heard). As good an idea as it is to include a love interest, she weighs the film down with exposition it did not need, and unfortunately underwrites the entire relationship. It affords the film some large laughs, but not at the same frequency as the rest of the cast.Relatively new director David Gordon Green has created a unique film for the growing canon of Apatowian films. On one hand, it feels like it could belong to the same family as Superbad, Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. But unlike those movies, it looks much different. Green gives the film a gritty look for its majority, and even at its brightest times, seems to make everything look washed out. He also has a habit of focusing on one character at a time, giving them the time to say what they need to, and moving on to the next person. It is never distracting, but it is obvious from the very beginning that someone with a different look and feel for things is behind the camera, as opposed to just an Apatow regular.Acting wise, the film is fairly solid.Rogen and Franco are near perfect in their roles. Their chemistry is outstanding, and their franticness helps make the movie truly believable, even as it descends into being fairly random. While I knew that Rogen would be able to portray the role well, I was surprised by just how good Franco was. This is nothing I would have ever expected him in, and I doubt anyone else ever thought they would see him here. But he delivers an even better performance than he did in any Spider-Man film, and easily may be some of his best work to date. He gets the most laughs in the film, and going on sheer looks, it is not any wonder why.The supporting cast, including Cole, Kevin Corrigan, Craig Robinson and Rosie Perez are all great additions to the cast. While I would have liked a bit more exposition from Cole and Perez, the scenes they do have allow the film to have perfect 80's style villains, and fit right into the film's mould. Corrigan and Robinson, both having worked in Apatow films before, do very well for themselves here in extended roles. Their chemistry, while not as good as Rogen and Franco's, give the film another angle for viewing, and offer some pretty hilarious moments.The real marvel here is Danny McBride. I was not a big fan of his, but he is downright hysterical here. He steals scenes from just about everyone, and actually makes his distinct brand of angered humour funny. I guess he just needed the right role, and this was it.While it was not exactly what I was expecting, I can say that I did genuinely enjoy Pineapple Express. Its unique style sets it apart, and who could say no to a film with a theme song by Huey Lewis and the News? 7.5/10.",7,4,8,6 August 2008
Sin City," It's just one of those films that you cannot call anything but cool
","Frank Miller's Sin City is simply, the best comic book film ever made. For every film with characters based in comics, you always hear the critic commenting on whether the film was good or not, and you always hear the fanboys screaming out how the film completely ignores the comics mythos. For Sin City, both camps were raving. Robert Rodriguez, in his bold move of making Frank Miller his co-director, has helped to create a fantastically dark and sick looking film that feels more authentic than any other comic book film ever has.The film mainly chronicles three of Frank Miller's stories (with tidbits of a fourth). The opening and closing story, 'That Yellow Bastard', is about Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a hardnosed cop with a 'bum ticker' (as he keeps mentioning), attempting to end the cycle of sexual depravity for Junior (Nick Stahl). The second takes off right after the opening of 'Bastard', and is 'The Hard Goodbye'. It recalls Marv's (Mickey Rouke, behind layers and layers of face makeup) quest to find the killer(s) who set him up for the murder of Goldie (J'aime King), the one woman who treated him better than the monster he is. The final story, sandwiched in the middle of 'Goodbye' and the ending of 'Bastard', is 'The Big Fat Kill'. This story chronicles Dwight (Clive Owen) and his desire to ensure that a pack of thugs, including Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro, again, under heavy face makeup), do not harm any girls in Basin City (notice where the title comes from?).Revealing any of the other elements of the story only ruins the film, as all of them tie together into one collective story.Having read the comics after seeing the film, I can only stand even more amazed than I was after getting up in the theatre. Rodriguez, Miller and Co. have literally taken the images off the comic book pages, and put them to celluloid. Every bit of the dark and brooding atmosphere of the books, is here in the film. From the black and white with splashes of choice colour, to the provocative clothing, to the strong graphic violence, even down to getting actors who look distinctly like their characters in the books (including those with horrific makeup); it's all here, and it all feels distinctly authentic.The story lines, no matter how darkly bizarre, brutally violent or how bleakly funny they become, all stay true to the comics. Every single actor breathes life into the words of Miller, and acts out their parts very well. When you look at the actor acting out their part, you cannot help but feel you are reading one of the books. It's that distinctive, and that much true to the books. Yes, there were a few changes in regards to the excessive nudity of the books, but the change was an obvious one that does not take away from the films at all. If anything, it only adds to weak areas of the books.Even more amazing than anything however, is the visual effects. The entire film was filmed on a green-screen, with only a few sets actually built. The rest is fully computer generated, and was filmed in parts (with many of the actors sharing the screen, never meeting each other until later on). The way Rodriguez has helped capture the film, is a testament to what digital technology holds for us in the future. It's sharp and is clearly, the only way Miller's stories could have ever been justifiably shown in a film. Every character looks like they are on every set, and nothing looks fake at all.For everything that is done right in the film, it still is not absolutely perfect. The pacing is a bit off in many of the scenes, and having 'Yellow Bastard' bookend the three stories really was not a wise choice (as it is the most uninteresting, and is mainly filled with exposition). There's just something off in the editing, and it really takes away from the strength the rest of the film packs. It's a fantastic film, and the clear-cut best film of 2005. But I will be damned if I say that the editing and pacing does not feel right.It may not be for everyone, but for anyone who can see it, Frank Miller's Sin City is just one of those films that you cannot call anything but cool. It's a masterpiece, and is a film that will be remembered for a long time, if not, as the pioneer of what digital photography can do for a film. It's fantastic, and is authentic. What more could a comic book fan ask for? 9.5/10.",9,4,5,20 June 2006
Happy Feet," Amazing animation, but a disappointment otherwise
","In the never-ending quest to appease all the filmgoers by throttling them with the same beloved idea over and over again, we have Happy Feet, another movie involving penguins as main characters. Despite not being too hyped to see the film, I was intrigued by all of the praise it was getting. But after seeing it, I really beg to ask why.The film begins much the same as the entirety of March of the Penguins, with the Emperor penguins mating rituals. Only these penguins can talk, and can make the audience actually understand their mating calls - singing. After a particularly interesting opening musical sequence, we meet Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman). They fall in love, and they conceive a baby. After Norma Jean leaves to retrieve food, Memphis is left with the egg. Not so long after just barely saving the egg from a fatal accident, it hatches, and Mumble (Elizabeth Daily as a youngster, and Elijah Wood when older) is born. For some reason, Mumble has issues singing. But he does not have any problems dancing, which only brings trouble from the rest of the penguins, including his parents. The rest of the film chronicles Mumble's ups-and-downs, and how he confronts his 'problem'.Despite its cuteness, I just thought the movie was way too silly for its own good. The singing and dancing was alright for the first little bit, but just did not work nearly as well as the film went on. It wants to be the focus of the film, but feels way too awkwardly placed in between intervals with the actual plot. Even worse is the fact that the plot randomly deviates about halfway through the film, and brings in points that barely any child would be able to understand. To me, it felt out of place in the film, and just felt like it was thrown in as an after thought to make the film even longer than it should have been. I knew the trailers really left a lot to the imagination (as does the actual concept for the film), but I am fairly certain they could have pulled off something much better than they did. I do not want to reveal just what it is that happens, but despite the good intentions with the message, it just does not work.The voices are all fairly well done all around. Robin Williams is zany as always in his three roles, but of course, he pulls them off with such excellence that you can barely tell that he is voicing more than one (if any at all). Wood is great as Mumbles, and Brittany Murphy does an adequate job as the love interest Gloria. Kidman does alright for herself (if you can even tell its her voice), but I was really stunned by Jackman. His Elvis impersonation is gold, and he just rocks the screen anytime his character says anything. For such a busy actor, you really can tell his commitment to pictures like this, and it only helps to show the good things he has coming for him in the future.The real standout of the film however, are the CGI effects. These penguins look amazingly real, and their backgrounds look even better. Just looking at the penguins, you can barely tell whether they are digitally fabricated or if they are real. They walk and move like penguins, and they look pitch perfect in comparison with March. Mumble's body is particularly awestriking, as it shows off individual strands of fur in every shot. When he jumps in and out of water, it is very noticeable, and never falters once. It reminded me a lot of how excellent the original Toy Story film looked back in the '90s, and how things have improved even more since then. The snowy landscapes are also particularly good and realistic to boot. I was amazed by just how wonderful this film looked, and even more impressed by its realism. The other animals, from seals to whales, also look amazingly realistic. I felt like I was watching the real thing, not just an animated film.If anything, the film fumbles when it attempts to mix in some live-action footage late in the game. It may look like it was digitally created at first, but soon after you can see how blatantly obvious it is that it is not. It just looks weird, and it takes away from the excellent work done throughout the rest of the film. Why the filmmakers would insist on ruining a perfectly well animated film, I am still unsure. But as it goes along with the random misplaced subplot, I really begin to wonder why it was thrown in at all.To me, Happy Feet is a movie made with good intentions, but just does not end up fulfilling them. It ups the stakes too high for itself, and it just really builds up to nothing. I was disappointed heavily by it, and am still puzzled by just what the critics were thinking. Maybe I missed something? Or maybe I am just seeing through the shoddy job done on the film? Obviously it will go unknown, but just do note that there are far better animated films that have been released this year. Feet just feels subpar and inadequate in comparison to them.6/10.",6,13,26,17 November 2006
Slumdog Millionaire," An amazing film you won't easily forget
","Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is an uneducated young adult, one question away from winning India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. But not many people believe an orphan from the slums of Mumbai could ever get that far without cheating. He is arrested, tortured and interrogated under these increasing suspicions. To prove his innocence, Malik tells the police the story of his life, and how he managed to know every answer.Slumdog Millionaire is quite simply, one of the best films of 2008. It tells a timeless and endearing story, and is one of the most unique films of the decade. Danny Boyle, a unique and enigmatic director in his own right, has crafted one hell of an adventure piece that deserves every ounce of praise it has gotten. It starts up, and it is almost a crime to look away.Rather effectively, the film covers Jamal's life with his brother Salim as orphan children of the slums, before moving onto their lives as teenagers scraping together cash and their eventual very different adult selves. The editing is fast-paced for the most part, and the transitions between life cycles are just fabulous. It also manages to capture the relationship between Jamal and Salim quite magnificently through the use of various actors. Whether it is Ayush Mahesh Khedekar and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, or Tanay Hemant Chheda and Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala, or Patel and Madhur Mittal, each actor makes their relationship have a deep seated amount of genuine emotion injected into them. And for a group mainly consisting of actors with little to no experience, they do better than anyone could have expected. It is particularly amazing seeing Khedekar and Ismail working together, being so young on the screen but ensuring no one would question the believability of their plight or their relationship as brothers.While fantastical, the film depicts a very dystopic and gritty life of a kid in the slums. But while the film does not all take place in the slums, it still manages to be very vivid in its colour scheme. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and Editor Chris Dickens at once command the screen with beautiful colours in one instance, and then drab, darkened colours in another. Even the jumpy timelines work like I could never have imagined. Anyone who thinks they may end up confusing one time for another will be pleasantly surprised. You would have never expected this was a film primarily made by a group of British filmmakers.But the success of the film mainly hinges on Patel. Without question, he is the absolute best thing about the film. He may not have much experience, but he makes it look like he has acting for years. The emotion he conveys with his face is enough to make any American actor jealous. It is not quite method acting, but he says a lot without even uttering a word. Just watching his expression inside the train station late in the film is enough to make anyone want to weep. He gives just enough emphasis in the areas needed, and stands back and watches everyone else do the same in other instances. This is someone who has a lot of promise, and I would be surprised if he does not walk off with a nomination later this week. He has a lot of promise, and I can only hope he continues after such an amazing performance.The rest of the supporting cast, experienced or not, do a great job with their characters. I would have liked to see a bit more from Mittal, but sadly, his character is already beyond developed by the time he gets to him. Irrfan Khan gives the right amount of menace as the Police Inspector questioning Jamal, and Anil Kapoor does a great job as the skeptical and shady game show host.While the acclaim comes easy, the film does have a few faults. The character of Latika is way too underwritten. We understand early on the bond Jamal has with his fellow orphan, but we never understand any of her motivations or development. She is simply the girl who was there, and who he continued to pine after years later. The themes of fantasy and love are inherent at the very core of Slumdog Millionaire, but with how much we learn about Jamal and Salim, it seems like a bit of a cheat to not really learn much outside of the one-dimensional traits of Latika. Hell, there was more description and volume to the bad guys they encounter than there was for her. I will admit however, that Freida Pinto does an excellent job as the adult Latika, portraying her with plenty of finesse.It is also easy to come down on how much seems to be left to the imagination, or is merely explained in a sentence (how he even managed to get on the show stays a mystery), but the film compacts down so much that it becomes easy to forget what is not mentioned, and even easier to forget what was. Its two hour running time is by no means breezy (nor is it as agonizingly boring as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), but it lacks the ability to feel cohesive at the end. Not everything gels together. Fantasy or not, it leaves a little too much out. As much as I enjoyed it, it feels incomplete in certain areas, like it wanted to accomplish even more if it had the money or the resources.Slumdog Millionaire is an excellently well done film, worthy of all the recognition it is getting. It may not be perfect, but this fantasy-adventure will draw you in like no other. The film excels where very few did in 2008, and is truly one of the best films of the year. This is not a film that will easily be forgotten.9/10.",9,2,7,20 January 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," This epic conclusion will make a Transformers fan out of everyone
","Transformers: Dark of the Moon is Michael Bay's finest achievement. It is not his best film (that honour will always reside with The Rock), but it is his most mature film to date. After disappointing everyone including himself with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Bay went back to the drawing board with the final film in his robotic orgy of mayhem and destruction, and rehauled just about everything. While the results are not perfect, it shows that he may not be quite the hack we always thought he was. And that he knows exactly how to end things with a bang.Picking up a few years after the travesty involving the Fallen, Dark of the Moon revolves around secret government coverups, the US/Russian space race of the 1960s, high-level assassinations, secret counter- terrorism ops involving the Autobots, and Sam Witwicky's (Shia LaBeouf) search to find his place in the world. It may sound just as busy as the previous two films, but Dark of the Moon manages to let the story flow organically through the first two acts. It feels significantly more grounded immediately after it starts, and all the threads manage to lead somewhere. And rather surprisingly, there are very little action scenes splitting up the story beats. It stalls in some places due to a serious lack of editing, but I am willing to give more than enough credit to Bay and writer Ehren Kruger for composing something that actually held my interest and did not lose me twenty minutes in. The government intrigue and the blending of the Apollo 11 mission and infamous space race into the story was so incredibly well done that you almost forget you are watching a film about robots that can turn into cars. But what is really impressive about the film is how grown up it feels. When I watched Transformers and Revenge of the Fallen, I knew I was watching slickly produced movies primarily sold to teenagers and young males. While watching Dark of the Moon, it felt like it was catering to a more adult audience. The dark nature of the film is simply astounding, and becomes downright brutal in some areas. I was really surprised by Bay's go-for-broke style, but it works for the tone the film strives for. There are more than a few shocking moments sprinkled throughout that really push the PG-13 rating of the film. I predict that some parents may take immediate issue with how violent the film becomes.While the dark nature of the film flows throughout its excessive running time, the story comes to a screeching halt when it hits the third act and the massive battle scene begins. You may have read that it lasts almost an hour, and it comes pretty close. It is an absolutely insane, balls-to-the-wall action piece that simply needs to be seen to be believed. The blend of special effects, practical effects and 3D effects is simply outstanding. The addition of the real 3D effects helps make the battle, and the robot antagonists, feel more real than ever. Bay has staged some awesome fights in the previous two films, but this ridiculous heart-stopping battle is simply incredible and outdoes every single one. It is worth the price of admission alone, Transformers fan or not.Of course, this is a Transformers film, so it is not without its fault. The 3D may be the best since Avatar, but it never really comes alive until the final act of the film. Leading up to that, it is just as underwhelming as every other 3D film you have seen recently. And as you likely have guessed, the film is far too long for its own good. Some scenes drag themselves out unnecessarily, and others are cut up way too quick. But what really drags it out is the obscene level of comedy taking place before the epic battle starts. I mentioned how adult the film is, but it still attempts to bring in the child audience with goofy jokes and ridiculously zany performances from John Malkovich, John Turturro, Alan Tudyk and especially Ken Jeong. The previous two films seemed like they had a few too many jokes, but here they just feel forced and overdone. It makes the film feel desperate in some scenes to evoke the dark tone it is aiming for, and in other scenes feels like a complete betrayal. Acting wise, there are not a lot of standouts. LaBeouf does his usual scared hero routine, and both Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson do their usual ass kicking routine. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is absolutely stunning eye-candy as Sam's new squeeze Carly, and she wisely does not even attempt to act. Frances McDormand does well in a thankless turn as a CIA honcho, but Patrick Dempsey is likely the only human character who gets to chew scenery and not overact while doing it. I have yet to be impressed with him as a film actor, but he gives a great performance here easily outshining everyone not playing a robot. Voicewise, Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving are excellent as always, as is the absolutely impeccable Leonard Nimoy playing Sentinel Prime.I wanted to love Transformers: Dark of the Moon for everything that is done right and all the mistakes it makes up for. But it still has its share of problems that seem to be characteristic of the franchise more than anything else. Yet, do not let these issues hold you back from experiencing the sheer absurdity of Bay's robot opera. It is a wild event, and one of the few true worthwhile blockbusters we have seen this summer. After being disappointed by the previous two films, I can say without fault that I was made a fan by this film. I just wish I did not have to wait for three movies to make it happen.7/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",7,5,11,28 June 2011
The Social Network," Hypnotic, important and unmissable
","This late in the game, David Fincher's The Social Network needs no real introduction or proper synopsis. It is a dramatized, debatably truthful version of how Facebook was created by Harvard dropout Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), juxtaposed with two lawsuits with people 'involved' in its creation.When I first saw the film in October, my feelings were immediately uncertain. I thought it was good, but not great, and was left with the same emptiness many people have continued to complain about since the film's release. After having re-watched the film a second time, knowing full well what the experience was going to be akin to, not only do I feel The Social Network is an excellent piece of celluloid, but also the most important film of the year and the current decade. The fact that Fincher and writer Aaron Sorkin were able to craft such an intense and wild ride out of something as mundane as HTML coding and alleged 'idea theft' speaks volumes for their creativity, and suggests that not every silly idea for a film will turn out as bad as it initially sounds.Had Fincher's name not been attached to the credits, it would be insanely difficult to even consider this be the work of the same man who gave us Fight Club, Se7en and the Oscar-winning The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. But looking closer, you will immediately notice his calling cards – the frantically paced, hyper kinetic editing style his films have been well known for, alongside his meticulous sense of detail. While we already knew he was a master in both realms, his work in The Social Network only helps cement what a talent he has so quickly become. Every scene is just so incredibly constructed, that it manages to haunt and hypnotize you at the same time. And whereas indulgence and length bogged down Zodiac and practically destroyed anything Benjamin Button had going for it, it is nice to see Fincher scaling back and maintaining brevity I had no idea he still had.The film would be nothing however, without Sorkin's incredible screenplay. While he may have been adapting Ben Mezrick's The Accidental Billionaires, Sorkin still manages to inject an almost outlandish dose of creativity and originality, and allows the project to become his own. The quick and witty quips between characters, the poetic voiceovers, the heartbreaking diatribes – the film is very much driven by dialogue and the written word, and what easily could have a by-the-numbers adaptation becomes something so much more. Just watching the opening of the film and seeing the rapidly devolving argument between Eisenberg and Rooney Mara, playing Zuckerberg's then-girlfriend Erica Albright, is enough to suggest any naysayers of the project were all so very, very wrong. After the debacle of the underrated Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and the incredibly disappointing Charlie Wilson's War, it was great to see Sorkin bounce back with such an incredible and unforgettable screenplay.While everything else practically works secondary to the work of Fincher and Sorkin (especially Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score), they all complement each other to help make the film the experience it truly is. Eisenberg is startling as Zuckerberg, managing to be hilarious, frightening and scared all at once. He maintains all of his emotions at every turn, and gives his best work since his brilliant turn in The Squid and the Whale. Andrew Garfield maintains a deer-caught-in-headlights look for the majority of the film, but it works for his portrayal of the wounded and betrayed best friend. Smaller turns from Rooney, Joseph Mazzello, Max Minghella, Justin Timberlake and especially Armie Hammer are all equally well portrayed and delivered. While they are not exactly unknowns, their lower key status among Hollywood powerhouses helps give an even greater sense of authenticity to the film.But the film's raw and unhinged power comes squarely from how timely the project is. We scoffed at the idea of a Facebook movie, but it really is the most important major motion picture of last year, and will likely remain one of the most important of the next decade. It stands out in a year dominated by 1980s nostalgia, sequels, prequels, remakes and throwbacks, as something so wildly original and indefinable. The film's target audience of young adults and 20-somethings have lived and breathed Facebook for years.But Facebook is almost the McGuffin in this case, because the film is not so much about the creation of the social networking website, as much as it is about the attitudes of the people who created it. Sure, there are debates about the authenticity and factual elements in the film, but anyone would be doubting themselves if they did not recognize how very real the jealousy, the selfishness, the bitterness and resentfulness, and the all-for-one attitude of these characters are in our current times. Journalists and writers have been saying for years how attitudes are have been shifting, and the sense of entitlement the younger generation and its peers maintain. While films have come and gone trying to quantify these assessments, and try to define the internet-bred generation, I feel The Social Network is the first to truly get it right, to truly define this generation. The liberal and embellished changes were made for dramatic effect, but they make the project that much more real and hard-hitting. I saw myself being reflected back in these characters, and its hypnotic appeal makes the proceedings that much more terrifying.I enjoyed but did not adore The Social Network the first time I saw it. But I think with every fresh re-watch, the film will get better each time. It truly is one hell of a movie, and one that will continue to grow with its importance. We laughed at the idea of a movie about Facebook, but with how important it has become to just about everyone in their day-to-day lives, we should have never had any doubts.9/10.",9,2,4,25 February 2011
The Proposal," A missed opportunity for romantic comedy greatness
","Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a ruthless editor at a New York publishing house who is loathed by her staff. Her loyal assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) does what he can to please her, but he messages everyone in the office just as much about his hate for Margaret. During a meeting with the bosses, Margaret finds out her Visa has expired and she will be deported back to Canada. On a whim, she concocts a scheme that will allow her to stay in the United States: pretend she is going to get married to Andrew. As customs tries to dissect their fake relationship, the 'couple' travels to Andrew's parents house in Alaska to celebrate Grandma Annie's (Betty White) birthday, while finding out more about themselves.On the outset, The Proposal looks like a by-the-numbers romantic comedy unlike any other. The unlikely couple is set up early on, we get introduced very quickly to the strange and sitcomishly quirky family members and friends, and then we watch as the hi-jinx and love ensue. And for the majority of the first half, the film does exactly that. Only the film lets on that it knows how predictable it is and will become, but lets the cast have fun in their roles anyway. I did not laugh a lot, but I would be lying if I did not have a smile on my face watching Bullock and Reynolds act off each other. There is not a lot of chemistry between them, but it works because Reynolds' character is supposed to hate every fibre of Bullock's being. Watching him pull his wiseass sarcastic shtick has still not become tiresome when it is used in the right films (X-Men Origins: Wolverine was not one of those films). And Bullock has always been a reliable rom-com gem, so watching her back in a role she helped perfect was quite amusing.But then the film takes the necessary turns leading to its conclusion (packing on stranger and stranger moments of 'hilarity' involving White), and it runs out of gas all too soon. The small amount of laughs left got replaced by weepy melodramatic drama, and a key storyline involving Andrew's relationship with his father Joe (Craig T. Nelson). Its relative ease at knowing what kind of film it is gets replaced by trying to be a film it is not. It takes its quirky set-up, and it turns it into something stale. It feels like someone caught on that the film was playing too fast and loose with romantic comedy conventions, and decided to invigorate it with some ideas it did not need to use. As it beelines headfirst towards its finale, it just becomes a complete bore to watch and lacks any of the zest and enjoyment the proceeding half of the film had. Its predictability becomes a chore for it to fulfil, not a fun obligation.The downfall of the film is in the fact that the filmmakers realized how much of a by-the-numbers romantic comedy it was, tried to change it up, but left most of the evidence behind. The requisite ex-lover is here in Gertrude (Malin Akerman). It seems to be fine for her to hang around with the family, and she reveals a few secrets about Andrew's past, but the film does nothing with her otherwise. Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare) is set up to be this dastardly villain of a customs agent, deadest on proving Margaret and Andrew are faking their engagement. But by the time he shows up again after his initial introduction, you have practically forgotten he was introduced at all. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen do a decent job as Andrew's parents, but their relationship now and from before Andrew left Alaska is never really fleshed out. We only get small chunks of what went on, and not enough to piece together this backstory that seems so integral to the film. White and Oscar Nuñez are here specifically to be comic relief, but even their outrageous antics become tiresome as the film goes on.But the brunt of the blame falls on Bullock and Reynolds. They work so well together for the first half of the film (age gap notwithstanding) that it just becomes downright heartbreaking to see it all fall apart by the end. It almost looks like the performances they were proud of ended up all at the beginning, and all the negative and rehearsal practice footage ended up at the end. You can almost pinpoint where their hearts are in it making this film, and when they just could care less. If they look like they stopped caring what happens, then why should the audience? It is just so disappointing when you go into a film with low expectations, only to have them shattered so well by being so surprised, only to realize too soon that your low expectations were right all along. I had the same experience with I Am Legend, watching a great first half only to fall prey to an absolutely atrocious second half. While The Proposal was never on track for the same off-the-rails disaster Legend quickly became, it still stands as a film that started well and just ended up being a failure.While there are some hilarious moments littered throughout the film (even when it is at its weakest), The Proposal still acts as a missed opportunity. It has the makings for a typical romantic comedy, but one with an awareness for the genre that does not impede on its ability to be enjoyable. But it betrays that sensibility far too quickly, and ruins any of the fun viewers could have had with it. It is by no means unwatchable, but unfortunately, it is nowhere near as good as it could have been.6/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",6,0,1,23 October 2009
Hustle & Flow," Fails to answer the question of why it's so hard out there to be a pimp.
","Alright, so even after watching the entirety of Hustle & Flow, I'm still quite uncertain why it's so hard out there to be a pimp. It's not that the movie doesn't try to tell you, it's just that it doesn't do a hell of a good job doing it.Save spoiling the whole movie, DJay (Terrence Howard) is a pimp, who longs to make something of himself. He acquires an old keyboard through a drug deal, and after playing it, finds something he can do in order to stop having to pimp. He runs into an old pal (Anthony Anderson), who helps record music, and finds his way to achieve his goal.Without going into too much description, the plot doesn't go too far from there. Long-winded symbolic speeches, and tons of rap music abound, but they don't allow a whole lot to be added to the film. The movie basically goes nowhere in just under two hours, and when it manages to try and attempt to, it becomes grounded and flies head-on into clichés. You get the sense that DJay wants more for himself, but his motivation is never really explained. He pokes at his upbringing, but not much is revealed other than a short, casual exchange. Yeah, the hookers he lives with whine and complain, but he really shows very little interest in that fact. Even after they yell at him for making them do the things they do, he still plays on their mind in order to make them want to continue.Hell, he has millions of fans all over his house because it's too hot, and complains about not having any money, yet he manages to buy a new top-line keyboard through drug deals and pimping, what he was doing before when he claimed to have no money. So how did he pull off buying a new keyboard? It's never explained of course.Another thing that doesn't help is the fact that while his performance is excellent, Terrence Howard is the whitest African-American in the world. His speech, his mannerisms, they aren't quite true to what is thought of to be a pimp, and they barely make a convincing black man. He just doesn't have it in him to play this kind of role, and it shows. He just seems to be having an awkward time throughout, and while he's trying to broaden out, he needs to learn his limits. His performance is easily the weakest of the five Academy Award nominated Actors, and could have clearly been filled by the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Eric Bana or Russell Crowe. Howard's acting was far superior in Crash, and should have been nominated over cast-mate Matt Dillon.The supporting performances are all pretty good for their tightly written parts. While not particularly dramatic, Anthony Anderson does prove here that he play more than just the toking' black guy in an action or comedy movie. The two female leads are great, and Ludicrous even pulls in a pretty good performance (not that it was a whole stretch for him, but still).The locales and film-making style are all pretty good (the title sequence nod to the 1970's was a good touch), and stay consistent throughout. The music of course, for a rap film, is loud and swear-word filled. But in this case, it works perfectly. The songs are all very well written, and even pretty catchy. Even though it's completely ridiculous, I'll be damned if I can't stop humming 'It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp'.In the end, it's not a particularly memorable film, but it's a worthy attempt.7/10.",7,0,1,26 March 2006
The Simpsons Movie," A return to the satire and wit that made the TV show so memorable in the first place
","It should come as no surprise to anyone that The Simpsons Movie is as hyped or anticipated as it is. After eighteen seasons, the show still pulls in decent and consistent ratings, and even though the quality of the show has fallen a bit by the wayside the past few years, it will still rule supreme as one of the most popular television series' of all time. But with dodgy episodes as of late (and by late, I mean at least the last five years), the real question was whether or not the film would suffer.Thankfully, it seems, the writers were waiting for something like this to truly let the show and its characters shine.Curiously, the trailers are very cryptic as to what the film is actually about. I found out a few days before, and I think it ruined a few of the surprises that were in store. But for the most part, for all Simpsons fans young and old, be prepared for a treat.Yes, the film does feel like an overextended episode, but not in the traditional sense. Whereas the Family Guy DVD movie literally felt like three episodes of the show strewn together, The Simpsons Movie actually makes a point of allowing the entirety of the film to feel cohesive and all so very attached to itself. Of course, this also means that it did not truly stretch the fabric confines of what is allowed in a movie as opposed to what is allowed on television (save for some extra violence, a few casual swear words, and one very bizarre skateboard-related dare). But while this element helped the South Park film become the controversial musical epic that it was back in 1998, I think it would have worked against The Simpsons.By making it very in tune with the TV show, and feeling like it could stand side-by-side just about any episode, it is a true ode to the fans, and to all people who just loved watching the show in its prime. Loaded to the max with references to pop culture and even the series itself, it truly is a blast to watch for anyone who catches the random episodes shown every hour of every day.The story, for what little amount of story there is, is fairly intriguing and a lot different than I envisioned it (even with knowing a little more about it). The many writers have clearly understood what worked and what did not over the entire Simpsons run, and have constructed what I would believe is a new rendition of the olden style. It feels like an old Simpsons episode, but we know it has been created now, during the slump of creativity where the show is concerned. I always hoped that they were saving all the good ideas for the movie, and with a few exceptions, I think I was right. It is better written, better voice-acted (everyone is back, and everyone is just as good as ever), and so much funnier than anything that has come out of that camp since at least the early 2000's. There are moments where I laughed so hard, that I forgot I was watching a Simpsons cartoon as new as this. And even when the comedic moments fall flat on their face, it still comes off as something worth a smile.The animation is an interesting case all in itself. While the characters are animated using traditional hand-drawn techniques, all of the backgrounds are clearly computer-generated. It works in instances where the characters are just talking or when they are moving around normally, but it looks a little bizarre during scenes with excessive movement (the mob scene in the trailers is one such example). It gets a little jagged, and the hand-drawn stuff just does not look proper in any of these scenes. One small scene close to the end of the film, with Homer dreaming, just looks horrendous with the combination of traditional and computer animation. It just does not work together, and I think it may have been better off to just stick with traditional animation for the entirety of the film (since computer generated versions of The Simpsons clan would have truly been one of the worst moves in film history if it were to have been done). I liked that the creators experimented with such a process, but it just looks like it should have been done a little differently.But I cannot help but feel that this film may truly be the swansong for The Simpsons. With it being handled so well, and actually edging back into the satirical wit the show once had, the film feels a lot more like a goodbye than anything. By bringing everyone together like this, it makes me imagine that the creators are trying to come up with the most proper goodbye that anyone could imagine for these insanely popular characters. It truly was a collaborative effort, and it shows in how much works in the movie, and how much no longer works so well on the show. After years of waiting, the creators finally delivered on a promise first thought-up in the early 1990's, and it will be worth the wait for many fans. But if this not the way they were figuring they would go out, than what is? Should I start getting excited for what may be in store for this family of five in the future, or should I stay content that the filmmakers actually pulled of the movie, and truly made it great? Whatever the answer, the wait is over, and fans should rejoice. The Simpsons Movie is funny, sweet, tender, and all so entertaining. It is exactly what we have been waiting for, and almost no one should be disappointed by the final result.8.5/10.",8,4,10,27 July 2007
The Fighter," A good movie, but unable to become anything better
","Despite seeing The Fighter just before Christmas, I never got around to writing a review. Unlike other Oscar hopefuls that I had seen and never reviewed, I sat down more than once to write my thoughts about Mark Wahlberg's passion project more than once. Except I could never bring myself to write any words. I would just sit and look at a blank document, trying to will myself to write and instead coming up with nothing. I had enjoyed the movie, but was something deeper holding me back from writing about it? The Fighter revolves around the early half of Mickey Ward's (Wahlberg) boxing career. He has always been managed by his mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and trained by his crack-addicted older brother Dickie (Christian Bale), and never looked the other way to how things could be different if he had professionals helping him out instead. But after hooking up with a local bartender named Charlene (Amy Adams), and after a rather brutal match, Ward starts to look in another direction for his future.While the movie may be called The Fighter, Ward's quest for redemption and a title shot are not the focus of the film until the last act of the film. It focuses more so on Ward's rather eccentric family unit (Alice had a number of children, not all with the same fathers), and focuses rather heavily on Dickie's battle with drugs and the subsequent HBO crew making the real life documentary High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell (which is dramatized and recreated here). And while these focus points are not necessarily a bad thing, they do take away from the subject of the film, and the real story at the heart of the film. It also causes a bit of misdirection – should we care more about Mickey, who should be the main character in the film, or do we focus more on Dickie or Alice? It never seems sure of itself until the final act, and until that point is a bit too jumpy with its focus.But when the film is focused and on-track, it is rather creative in its editing and how it recreates real life events. While the whole movie has a hazy, washed out look to itself, the scenes involving actual boxing matches have noticeable grain, are more beaten and scratched up. They have been modified to the point of looking like we are watching an actual taped version of the real life match. The actual audio from the matches is even spliced into the mix, giving it an even more authentic feel. Much the same goes for the portions shown of the High on Crack Street documentary, looking more and more like the actual doc would have back in the mid 1990s. The film was misframed and noticeably softer in the theatre I saw it in, but the magic of these authentic elements was too well composed to not take notice.But then authenticity seems to be what director David O'Russell was striving for here. He cast actual residents of Lowell, Massachusetts in roles in the film (not unlike Ben Affleck does in his Boston-set epics). One of Mickey's actual trainers, police sergeant Mickey O'Keefe, plays himself in the film. The film was partially filmed where it actually takes place. Everything about the film's creation keeps adding up, and it could not have just been Wahlberg's passion for the project that made it stay so authentic. And because the film is so unlike O'Russell's other projects (Flirting with Disaster, Three Kings and the absolutely enigmatic and baffling I Heart Huckabees), the authenticity really stands out as something different and somewhat of a departure for the director and for a film like this. It easily could have been another Rocky or Raging Bull, but it made something of itself and brought some form of uniqueness to the genre.Both Leo and Adams provide excellent performances as the two key female figures in Mickey's life. They both have just enough spunk and zest to bring these two spirited characters to life. They may yell a lot, and have more than one instance where they rant and swear at each other, but both hold their own against each other and everyone else on screen. They just have a presence that cannot be easily imitated, and no matter what emotion they are trying to bring out on-screen, you know that they are being as authentic as physically possible.But they are both easily crushed by the power and magnetism of Bale. He is almost unrecognizable at first as the crack-addled Dickie, looking downright terrifying in some of his early scenes. We knew he was as method as they come from his work in films like The Machinist and Rescue Dawn, but he really puts it all on the line here. You will never once doubt his performance in any instance. You may become downright sickened because it is so realistic and horrific in how far he takes it. He is unmissable in this role, and if it does not get recognized by more than the critics' associations, than something is truly wrong with the system.With that said however, it must be noted that our 'lead' in the film is the weakest link. Wahlberg just cannot hold a candle to any of these three top form performers, and you can tell they are running circles around him. Sure, he is visibly putting in some effort, but it is not enough to even compare to how much better they are than he is. It is almost sad to note, but much like the film not focusing on his character, the camera does not seem to want to focus on the actor either. The Fighter is a good movie, but with that inherent flaw, it never seems able to make anything more for itself.8/10.",8,1,5,16 January 2011
Evil Dead II," A groovy cult classic!
","Before anyone even attempts to watch any of the Evil Dead films, they need to understand that there is zero continuity in the series. Absolutely none. What happens in one film is totally different in the other. Apparently this was done in Evil Dead II because the filmmakers could not obtain footage from the original film to put into the sequel, so they decided to redo it altogether – completely different from the first film (I assume they just did this for kicks in the third, even with the big footage excised from this film).After a brief interlude about the Book of the Dead (or Necronomicon Ex-Mortis as it's called in the film), the film opens with Ash (Bruce Campbell) taking his girlfriend Linda up to an isolated cabin in the woods for a little R & R. He finds a tape recorder and the Book of the Dead on a desk in the cabin; he plays the tape. Turns out, it's a recording from the previous owner of the cabin, and by subsequently playing the tape, Ash wakes up the evil spirits within the forest – the Evil Dead.This is a bad thing, as it literally takes Linda, leaving Ash frightened and saddened at the same time. He goes into the woods to look for her, but eventually only finds a possessed being in her body coming to attack him. He decapitates her, buries her in the ground, and goes back to weep within the cabin. Some how, all of this takes place within the first ten minutes of the film.What follows is probably one of the single most bizarre films anyone will ever see: fog runs rampant; blood of every color flies everywhere; a man loses his hand to demonic possession and then further attaches a chainsaw to replace the stump; tree branches attack and further abduct a woman and that's just the start. To explain anymore of the film would completely take away and ruin the remaining 74 minutes of the film.This is the movie that made Bruce Campbell a cult B-movie God. His acting is off the wall, never the least bit serious. This is the cult actor in his prime, before he became known for bit parts in cheesy movies and a successful novel writer. He gets beaten up throughout the film as well, leaving a lot to say about how far actors have to go for their directors.Speaking of directors, can anybody believe the man who went on to create the hugely profitable Spider-Man series started off with movies like this? Sam Raimi created his entire legacy with this film, and the rest of the series; one can easily see how much it has influenced his later work. Remember that scene in Spider-Man 2 where Doctor Octopus attacks all of the surgeons and doctors operating on him after his accident? With the crazy camera angles and totally random chainsaw? The scene is straight out of Evil Dead II. And the influence extends to all other horror films as well. Peter Jackson, Oscar winning director of The Lord of the Rings series, credits Evil Dead II as one of his early influences, as do many other directors.The influence and the legacy of this totally silly, but undeniably, cult film can be felt all over the film industry – and it continues to influence to this very day. A definite film to see.8/10.(Portions of this review originally appeared on http://www.dvdfanatic.com).",8,1,3,3 April 2006
Law Abiding Citizen," A flawed, but entertaining piece of throwaway cinema
","On an ordinary evening, Clyde Sheldon (Gerard Butler) watches helplessly as his wife and child are killed in front of him. Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hot shot lawyer with a record conviction rate he is not willing to sacrifice, takes the case and manages to send one of the criminals responsible for the murder to death row. But the real perpetrator gets off with a much lighter sentence. Rice sees nothing wrong with this based on the lack of evidence, but Sheldon does not feel justice is served. Zap forward ten years later, where Sheldon begins his quest for justice and people involved with the case are picked off one by one.When I first saw the trailer for Law Abiding Citizen, I was immediately reminded of David Fincher's brilliant psychological horror-thriller Se7en. Whereas Se7en revolved around the investigation of John Doe and his randomly chosen victims based on the idea of the seven deadly sins, Citizen revolves around a wronged man choosing his victims based on their involvement with his case. The film takes away the suspense of trying to figure out who is doing it, and attempts to focus more on the why and how. For the most part, we get to watch every kill and get to slowly piece together how and why everything is happening. There is nothing random about any of the events in the film, and the suspense lies in the comprehension of what is occurring, not in the horrific one-upping randomness of the events.But the momentum that Citizen has in its early moments is lost quite quickly as the film goes on. While Se7en basked in toying just as much with the two leads as it did the viewer, Citizen seems content at laying everything out rather easy and waiting for the viewer to pick up on the reasoning and eventual twist. I will admit that I was surprised by that twist, but a lot of what leads up to it feels very mundane. There is a very thrilling aspect to the events taking place, but after the first few characters bite the dust, there just seems to be very little life left in the story. It feels like it was an intriguing idea to start that gets tapped out far too quickly. More maddening (albeit very intriguing) is the absence of some things most films would find key. We learn very little about Sheldon (outside of what the trailer already tells us), we learn very little about Rice (outside of how dedicated he and his team are to his records), and we learn almost nothing about the murders that start the film off and are the reason for what happens in the first place. Not all of these things are bad, but they do manage to feel bothersome at times anyway.Despite all this, Kurt Wimmer (the man responsible for the hideously underrated Equilibrium and the just plain hideous Ultraviolet) manages to still make the story entertaining and interesting enough to sustain the audience for the entire ride. The intensity of some of the sequences, and the sheer bloody and unflinching brutality of some of the murders more than make up for the flawed screenplay. He seems to be a stronger writer than a director, and I can only hope he sticks to writing. F. Gary Gray, a veteran action director, does not exactly bring a distinct style to the film, but competently brings the story out quite well.The acting, much like everything else, is flawed but still not all that bad. The supporting cast unfortunately gets very little to do outside of attempt to hold their own against Foxx and Butler. There are a couple of cast members who do quite a bit for the film, specifically Leslie Bibb and Colm Meaney (who has been all but missing in action from mainstream films as of late), but the script never really lets their characters flourish outside of being one-note and one-dimensional. Practically everything we try to learn about Bibb's character is either never elaborated on, or brushed off entirely. I would have liked to have seen more of a presence from all the supporting actors, but these two specifically could have done with more material.Foxx has failed consistently at trying to perform anywhere near the majesty of his Oscar-winning turn in Ray. There is no doubt that he is a great actor, but he has yet to prove since why we all believed he could pull Ray Charles off so well. In Citizen, he seems a bit too muted. In the scenes where the world begins to close in on his character, we can see the pain coming through, but never really get to see Foxx attempt to shine the way we know he can. He just seems to be going through the motions, hoping the lines will do the work and not his acting. It is a decent enough performance, but that is it.Butler on the other hand does his best work here since 300. He just looks like he is having fun with the role, and chews right into the twisted individual Sheldon quickly becomes. Watching him interact with Foxx's character and running circles around him is reason enough to watch the film. His performance is not incredible by a long shot, but there is more life and depth within Butler at any given moment than there is in the entirety of the film. When the film goes limp, Butler just keeps on putting everything into the role. My only qualm is with his uneven accent, which seems to be a consistent problem for him.Law Abiding Citizen is an entertaining piece of throwaway cinema. It is incredibly flawed, but there is enough value in what is good about it to make it a worthwhile watch. Just do not go in expecting something on par with Se7en.7/10.",7,1,4,3 March 2010
Up in the Air," A masterwork of maturity and true artistry for Reitman and Clooney
","There is so much I want to say about Up in the Air that it has taken me days to even attempt to sit and write out my thoughts on it. It is the rare movie that is every bit as good as the critics and awards groups are making it out to be, and maybe even a little better. While it is not quite the best movie of the year, it is still a movie very much of its time, and one that will not soon be forgotten.The film follows Ryan Bingham (George Clooney), who crisscrosses across the United States firing the people major companies cannot. He leads a very secluded lifestyle, rarely spending any time at home or with his family, and finds the joys in life come from collecting plastic loyalty club cards. He even works as a motivational speaker, giving people advice on how to live their lives more like his. But he enjoys the life, and thrives in it. When young up-and-comer Natalie (Anna Kendrick) comes up with a plan for his company to save costs across the board, he is at first flabbergasted at the very thought of his lifestyle coming to an end. But then his boss sends him out to teach Natalie more about what he does, and Ryan begins to see things a little different.Jason Reitman belongs to a very exclusive group of young filmmakers who are getting better with each film they make. With Thank You for Smoking, Juno, and now Up in the Air, he has demonstrated an unparallelled consistency that is unlike almost all of his peers, including his own father Ivan (who acts as a producer here). Even though this is his third major film (and almost certainly his second Best Director Oscar nomination), he simply works like he is already a master filmmaker. The film knows what turns to take, what moves to make; everything is just so highly crafted and near perfect that you may wonder if this really is his third major film. There is so much creative output on display here that the film is simply a marvel to look at from the mindset of a filmmaker. The slapdash editing style of his previous two films is even stronger here than before as well.If Reitman is at fault anywhere, it is in the jumping tones. It works very well for this film (whereas it nearly sank the obscenely hilarious satire in Smoking), but it has not been quite honed to perfection quite yet. Earlier this year, the animated emotional roller coaster of adventure found in the ironically titled Up managed to find its footing jumping around from being devastatingly sad to hilariously funny in a moment's notice. But that film had the benefit of being much more simplistic than Up in the Air (even with its unmatched character depth and balance). The film does strike a good balance, but as Ryan grows as a character, the film's tone does not necessarily follow with it. There were more than a few scenes that should have been funny but were sad, and others that were sad but came off hilarious. It is all about balance, and not every scene feels like it is as balanced as the next. The biting satire Reitman crafted in Smoking is here, as are the hilariously poignant moments he helped extend through Diablo Cody's script for Juno, and even a bit extra that comes from the maturity Reitman has gained as a filmmaker. But if there is a small flaw in the film, this is where it lies.If Reitman has matured as a filmmaker here, than Clooney has matured even more so as a leading man. While his one-two punch of Syriana and Good Night, and Good Luck gave Clooney an excellent range as a star, it is this film that cements his status as a leading man. He commands the screen every second he shows up, and never once do we question the legitimacy of his portrayal. Reitman may have given Ryan Bingham his voice, but Clooney gives him the breath of life. This character is a flawed hack of a man, living the dream that is at once everything we could ever want and a nightmare of everything we never want to even think of. As the tone flip flops, Clooney stays on the straight and narrow, never backing away from any challenges, and never once sacrificing the quality and dimensionality of the role. In a year of surprisingly great performances, this one is a clear standout. It is not the kind of ballsy role that Syriana's Bob Barnes was, but it is a stronger performance and one that may make us forget Batman and Robin ever existed (well, at least the Batman portion of the film).While J.K. Simmons, Sam Elliot, 2009 wonderkid Zach Galifianakis and Danny McBride all deliver great, small performances, and Jason Bateman helps ground the film in his surprisingly unfunny yet tragically serious role, it is Kendrick and Vera Farmiga that light up the screen in the few sections where Clooney is not chewing the scenery and just about everything else up. While Farmiga nearly ruined The Departed, she works as the yin to Clooney's yang. She delivers a brutally honest performance here, one that perfects Clooney's portrayal far greater than it ever could be. I was impressed with her work in every instance. Kendrick acts as the relative newcomer that she is, but it works for her rough around the edges character. I hope for more creative output outside of the Twilight franchise from her.Up in the Air is a flawed film, but the flaws can easily be looked past. It is an incredible feat for everyone involved, and one that stands out as honest and heartbreaking at the same time. It is likely the one to beat come March.9/10.",9,1,6,4 January 2010
Atonement," A visually exquisite film that could have been so much better
","Atonement tells the story of Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13-year-old fledging writer and member to a family of wealthy British socialites in the 1930's. She has a crush on the hired help in the much older Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), but she notices that her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) seems to have similar feelings. But after reading a letter by chance and witnessing some rather disturbing events, Briony changes the course of life for more than just a few people.I was not quite sure what I was expecting going into Atonement, but the movie I saw was not it. I do not necessarily think this is a bad thing, but I do think it helps to know very little about it. Yes, it is very romantic in a handful of scenes, but it so much more darkly mysterious than the ad material lets on. Just the sheer notion of the course of events that leads up to Briony's irrevocable change is quite disturbing all in itself.Atonement has a rather enigmatic method of sequencing. Falling quite distinctly beside the likes of Akira Kurosawa's Rashômon and Zhang Yimou's obvious homage Hero, Atonement tells its story from a few points of view, showcasing a few events through multiple angles. What is great is that we actually get to see these angles from the very point-of-view of the character, almost to the point of being a voyeur (much like Briony herself). It makes for an intriguing of watching the film, and it leads to a greater of understanding of the motivations of each of the main characters. It may not be easy for casual filmmakers to understand the use of seeing these angles used more than few times early on, but it does truly make sense as the film goes on, and is not simply a British upper class nod to those Asian filmmakers.The story itself, while being heavily convoluted (in part thanks to the really well done multiple angles), is a bit off. I liked where it went, and I like how it explored what happened to the characters (since the first half is almost entirely comprised of the day of Briony's big moment), but its focus seemed a bit wonky. I realize and understand what screenwriter Ian McEwan (and in turn, novelist Christopher Hampton) was trying to capture and achieve in the writing, but it works half of the time. I found myself more baffled at the lengths some of these scenes rather ridiculous, and just disliked how it was so careless with its moments of exploration and development. The characters do develop over the course of the film, but just not to the point that the film lends itself to thinking they do.What I also did not like was the length. The first half goes by fairly quickly, but the second half just drags endlessly. A lot of the strongest scenes in the film, and the ones I liked the most, are in the second half, but the filmmakers just seem to have less of a idea as to what they wanted to do with them. They know how to make them look great, but making them play off just as good seems to be a bit of a problem. It is disappointing to think so much effort was put into the early moments, but not enough was given to the later ones. It does not help that the first half does not jump around nearly as much as the second, but the film does not seem balanced. Once the ending hits, the film practically flies, but getting there is almost a test of endurance in itself.The beautiful imagery stays consistent throughout the film, even at its darkest (both literally and figuratively) moments. Director Joe Wright and company have composed a gorgeous looking film, with minute details at every corner and just the right amount of authenticity. Some of the scenes they compose are simply breathtaking as well. One long take late in the film in war torn France is simply fantastic, and speaks volumes of the level of effort put into making the film. It reminded me a lot of the amazingly captured scenes in Children of Men, and I think it qualifies as some of the best sequencing of the year. I was very impressed with the visuals, and I think they helped keep my eyes peeled to the screen and not faltering into the boredom that sets in because of the story. The typewriter infused score is also very well done, and quite riveting at times.The acting from the cast is uniformly good, with some standouts. After being disappointed with his work in The Last King of Scotland, McAvoy really knocked my socks off here. His wounded character is very well conveyed, and truly proves his worth as an up and coming actor. No, it is nowhere near as good as the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Viggo Mortensen, Johnny Depp or even Denzel Washington, but it is great all in its own. I can only hope he continues on this streak. Knightley on the other hand, is not all that great. She does fairly well for herself, but she does not seem to be giving it her all. I am not going to say that her acting is bad here, it just does not seem to be up to the calibre the film is trying to project.Ronan is the true marvel here (and miles ahead of Briony's older forms in Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave), and outshines everyone in the cast. Her naivety and amazing style speaks of being a more seasoned veteran, and I hope she can continue on this wave length for The Lovely Bones and beyond.In the end, Atonement is a good film that could have been a whole lot better. If for anything, see it for the astonishing visuals and the even better Ronan.7.5/10.",7,5,9,3 February 2008
V for Vendetta," An important film that will only become even more important in time
","'Remember, remember, the fifth of November; the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.'And so stands a repeated quote from V for Vendetta, the latest from the Wachowski Brothers (or is it the Wachowski Siblings now?). While it is not the brilliant cinematic masterpiece that The Matrix has become since its initial release in 1999, the film still stands on its own as a fantastic piece of cinema, and one that will age well, and will become a much more important film in the future, than it can ever desire in 2006.While undoubtedly controversial for its glorification and humanization of terrorism (done well in Steven Spielberg's recent Oscar-nominee Munich as well), Vendetta has a different agenda in mind. Having the film take place in futuristic, dystopic England was a great way to set the pace for the film, and an even better one as the film goes on. It's political message aspirations of a government much like Hitler's hits home hard, as the continuing war in Iraq and manipulative media reigns on. The recurring images and talks of a devastated United States, plagued by civil war, is only the beginning of the horrific imagery throughout the film that breaks down the barrier between the medium, and the real world.The performances are all excellent, even with the sad under-use of John Hurt, and the faceless Hugo Weaving (who still puts forth an astonishing performance as V). Natalie Portman continues proving her worth as an actress, and Stephen Rea puts in another fine performance in a sadly underrated career. The supporting cast, even with their tiny roles, help to make the film even stronger.If there is one thing the film has to come down to for its excellence, it's in the visuals. The way the film was shot just draws you right into the world, and only continues to keep you on edge as the striking imagery continues. The stunning use of blacks in every key sequence, and minor sequences is particularly noteworthy, and when the reds flow, they really do. The devastating, horrific images of disease, war, violence and death makes the film that much more important in the shape of things, and adds so much more depth and realism to the film than one could ever expect.But the film is not perfect. The Wachowskis stumble on more than a few sections of dialog, and bring the intensity of the film down to near slapstick levels. The entire early monologue with V using almost every word in the English language that starts with the letter V is just downright silly, and makes the film lesser than it much well deserves to be. All of the action sequences are very well choreographed, you cannot help but notice some of the post-Matrix feel of some of the scenes. We understand it's the same creators, but the originality and bold style of the film does not need to suffer as a result.As said, maybe not now, but in the future, this film will become an important entry into the halls of the so-called 'great films'. It's political message and uncompromising view of the future is bold, intense, and beautiful all at once. It is one that will be remembered.9/10.",9,1,3,21 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Downright hysterical for the most part, but not as good as Anchorman
","After a fairly terrible year in 2005, it should come as no surprise that it took another teaming with Writer/Director Adam McKay to score Will Ferrell another hit. Sure, Wedding Crashers did so much better than anyone would have ever expected, but all he had was a cameo very late in the film. His most successful film before that was Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Bergundy. The comedy and chemistry was excellent in that film, and even with the really lame material, made the film work in so many ways. Now we have Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. While not necessarily being a better film than Anchorman, it still ranks as a very positive improvement from the rest of the films Ferrell has been doing as of late.Ever since he was a child, Ricky Bobby (Ferrell), wanted to go fast. After one of the fastest 'growing-up' sequences I have ever witnessed in a film, we zip right into the action as Ricky is part of the pit crew for a NASCAR driver. After the lazy driver leaves halfway through a race, Ricky takes his place and manages to do so well, that he replaces him. Soon after, he is winning tournaments left and right, and even gets his best friend Cal (John C. Reilly) in as his partner on the track, helping him to win the races (and in turn, win second place after Ricky during the races). Ricky is leading the high-life, but after a few issues on the track, the team he works for decides to hire a gay Formula 1 racer from France, Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), to help shake things up.The film is much in the same formula as Anchorman, only set more in the satirical world of NASCAR. There are the obvious stereotypes thrown around about the stupid, hick Americans who are into the sport, and of course, all of the sponsorships and such that go into it. These stereotypes are obvious from the get-go, and after awhile, are not too jarringly distracting. They work well coupled in with the rest of the story, and unlike Anchorman, the film actually feels like it has heart and has some fairly dramatic moments (as best as can be used in an obnoxious comedy). Of course, that's not to say that there are not a whole whack of outrageously offensive jokes and crude humour (the majority of which are absolutely hilarious). It is instead, a great mix of all sorts of elements that work on-screen for the actors and for the film itself.A lot of the scenes are funny in themselves, but I find most of the humour to come from the minor quips the characters throw at each other. It is obviously not totally improvised, but the outtakes during the credits show just a few of the extra lines that are spouted by the characters. It worked in Anchorman, and it works just as good here. Unfortunately, there are a few too many jokes that just fall flat (a lot of Cohen's stuff just did not do it for me), and not nearly enough laugh-out-loud moments. There are plenty of moments of hilarity anyway, but there is room for improvement here and there.Of noteworthy achievement are the ways the scenes involving the race cars were filmed. They look absolutely awestriking during the races, and look even better during the brutal car crashes. If there was anything that could take away from the comedy in the film, it would be the amazing shots McKay and Company create in the NASCAR races.There is a little too much seriousness in some scenes however. It was great to see the film becoming more than just a stupid comedy, but there was a bit too much of it in some scenes. It drags the film out a bit, and makes it longer than it probably should have been. In some instances, it felt intensely long, but in others, it felt brisk and fast-paced. It all depended scene-to-scene, so it definitely could have been so much worse. Another thing I disliked, much like Anchorman again, was the fact that many of the scenes in the trailer were not even in the movie. Many of the money-shot, hilarious scenes, were in both, but some of the little ones did not make the jump to the final product. Is it negative to almost assume there are going to be tons of deleted scenes on the DVD (and potentially enough to make a whole other film out of them?). We'll just have to see.The acting out of everyone is solid, and almost everyone feels perfect in their roles. Ferrell is always great as screwball characters like Ricky Bobby, and he proves himself once again in the role. He has just enough edge and charisma to pull the character off without making him too much of a joke. Reilly nearly steals the show away from him as Cal, the even more dim-witted and bizarrely spoken best friends. Almost everything he says hits dead-on, and the chemistry between the two is just great. Cohen is alright in his role, although he feels a little too over-the-top for his own good. Supporting turns from Michael Clarke Duncan, Jane Lynch, Amy Adams, Greg Germann, Ted Manson and Leslie Bibb are all great in their roles, but Gary Cole stands out as Ricky's dead-beat and drunk/stoned father. His performance is electric, and undoubtedly causes the most laughs of anyone in the cast.While not as good as Anchorman was, this film still is a hell of a funny movie with some great performances. It may be a little silly, and some jokes may fall a bit flat, but if you are a fan of Will Ferrell, then he is back. And in top form to boot.8/10.",8,23,48,13 August 2006
