Requiem for a Dream," Best Film of the year 2000
","I can't wait for this DVD! Amazing. Ellen Burstyn should have taken the Best Actress award home instead of Julia. Great shots, great cast, great soundtrack by Clint Mansell. Thanks to Hubert Selby Jr. for writing this amazing story. Too bad the academy is soft and couldn't consider this for Best Picture. Darren Aronofsky's new Batman film is gonna be dark, and I can't wait!",10,0,0,27 March 2001
Mulholland Drive," David Lynch Triumphs Again!
","I saw 'Mulholland Drive' for the first time last night, and I loved it. The only thing I didn't like about it was that once it ended, I wanted more! I really like the characters, shots, and music. This another example of David Lynch's beautiful filmwork. Betty & Rita work well together. As my wife said this morning, if you like David Lynch, you'll love this movie - if you don't like his previous work, don't see this. I'm a big fan of all things Lynch, and she isn't really. I'm going to see the film again on Friday. Starting Friday, it's running here for a week. I'm going to try to see it as many times as I can while it's here! This is definitely another Lynch film that's not spelled out for you. I don't believe you can fully understand everything that happened in one viewing, or the connections between all characters. Everyone was wonderful in this film, and I applaud David Lynch. I'd like to see more of this material on the eventual DVD. Since it was originally shot as a pilot, I hope that leaves room for more new footage to eventually see the light of day in a DVD or sequel film release. I felt the film flowed nicely and didn't necessarily reflect any indication of it's being shot as a pilot for television. Amazing. Where can I pre-order a DVD?!? : ) 5 Star Film. See it.",10,2,2,17 October 2001
