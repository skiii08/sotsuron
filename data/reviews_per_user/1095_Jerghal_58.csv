The Lobster," Interesting movie that's not for everyone
","In a dystopian near future, single people, according to the laws of The City, are taken to The Hotel, where they are obliged to find a romantic partner in forty-five days or are transformed into beasts and sent off into The Woods.Now I'm sure you haven't heard that one before. I love these films which come up with these unconventional stories. The Lobster is a strange movie and the people in this future are all apathetic and uncharismatic which makes the fact that they have to form couples (probably for the survival of the human race) even more ironic. They bond on basis of common character traits (like .e.g a limp or short shortsightedness).This low budget production (4m$) has some big names like Rachel Weisz, Colin Farrel (who got a beer belly for the movie), Léa Seydoux, John C. Reilly and Ben Whishaw who all play their roles very minimalistic and subdued. The film is slow paced but still hypnotizing to look at, but I can imagine if these kind of movies are not your thing that you will find it quite boring.I found it an interesting movie which has some very dry humor in it (it's not a comedy mind you) and says something about the human condition and human relationships. I recommend it but that won't mean you'll like it.",8,16,34,23 December 2015
Captain Phillips," Good All-round entertainment
",Captain Phillips is based on true events and director Paul Greengrass who has his roots in docu filmmaking has already plenty of experience in making military themed films. It's filmed in his trademark shaky-cam style: this gives it a more dynamic feel and more immersion for the audience but for some people it might get a bit annoying. Performances are all-round excellent with Tom Hanks as the venerable Captain and some unknown actors as the Somalians. A good choice as well known actors might have been distracting and less believable. It's also obvious the US military lent their cooperation to this movie as it clearly demonstrates how the American army works as an efficient machine. Some actors in this film are also real-life army personnel. In this film it's not a problem as it doesn't feel like a military promotion as some other films like Annapolis or Act of Valor. Captain Phillips will keep you entertained for a good 2 hours so it's certainly worth the watch. For me it can win some Oscars but Gravity still remains my favorite.,8,0,0,9 February 2014
Child 44," Tensionless and slow
","Child 44 is a retelling of the story of the serial murders of Andrei Chikatilo. The cast is very much A-level (and the reason I saw this flick) with Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, Gary Oldman, Vincent Cassel and Charles Dance. But none of this matters much coz the movie is slow, drags on, has sideplots that make the story less streamlined and more convoluted. There are scenes that are meant to build the characters but only slow down the pace to a grinding halt and feel like they serve no essential purpose. There is almost no build of tension and it feels aimless. It's just crawls on for 137 mins till it reaches the end which feels very trivial and anticlimactic. So I'm not recommending this flick. I do recommend you check out 'Citizen X', a 1995 TV movie with Donald Sutherland and Stephen Rea which is about the same murders but done SO much better. The acting alone is just exquisite.",6,2,5,31 August 2015
John Wick," Stylish old fashioned revenge movie
","John Wick is and old fashioned revenge movie -much like 'The Equalizer' is actually- but a lot more wicked (pun intended)! I think I don't have to explain how these revenge movies work: they (the character and the audience) need a reason to take/want revenge on the bad guys and then you can brace yourself for the violent killing spree that leads up to the main prize. What Keanu lacks in sympathetic warm charisma (like Denzel) he more than makes up in coolness and style. John Wick is just badass! The fights are excellently choreographed (Wick uses the Central Axis Relock System in combination with martial arts moves) and the gunfights are fast and furious. The overall design of the sets and costumes is very slick and stylish and the soundtrack also features some cool tunes. Although the script wasn't written with Reeves in mind, it does feel like it fits like a glove. John Wick wasn't a great box office success but I bet this will grow into a cult hit on DVD and Blu Ray. Do check it out!",9,6,16,19 January 2015
Gravity," The best 156 shots you'll ever see!
",Gravity is a technical and directorial tour de force from Alfonso Cuarón sure to win some Oscars. Sandra Bullock almost single handily carries the film with an excellent screen performance. The technical complexity of this film which spent 4 years in development because technology wasn't advanced enough is quite mind-boggling. The opening shot is one continuous 17-min shot and the whole film is comprised of only 156 shots! Despite this low shot count there is plenty of complex camera movement. The visual effects are also very realistic and some of those VFX shots will go down in history as some of the most impressive ever seen. The 3D effect which in some movies doesn't work at all works very well here. This really is a film which you HAVE to see in the cinema if only for those space shots of the astronauts above our big blue planet. A very highly recommended masterpiece!,9,5,9,2 December 2013
Lone Survivor," Entertainment for the red blooded action loving patriot
","Peter Berg got around to realizing a project he's been working on for the last 5 years and for which he now probably had enough time coz after 'Battleship' nobody wanted to hire him anymore one would think. It's well known I guess that Berg is somewhat of a right wing warmonger so this film was right up his alley. Wahlberg and his team of marines are sent out to capture/kill a Bin-laden-like towelhead called Ahmad Shah. They get discovered by a bunch of old geezers with kids and decide not to waste them but to let them go so they can haul-ass back to their Al Qaida buddies who come after our heroes in full force. This gesture of 'christian life sparing' leads to a towelhead shooting gallery where many (brown) lives are wasted. The firefights are pretty well done with very good surround effects as you hear the bullets whizzing past your ears. But there are several scenes which are incredibly (but unintentional) comical. At a certain point they get blown of a hill by an explosion which causes them to fall for 5 minutes very much like the scene from the simpsons where homer keeps hitting rocks on his way down. Later in the film Wahlberg asks for a knife and receives a duck (I'm serious). Don't go looking for insight into the horrors of war with this film. It's all rather superficial and preachy. Also Wahlberg sometimes sounds a bit like a whiny bitch with his high pitched voice when he keeps whaling 'why did you save me?'. It's all supposed to be a patriotic ode to a brotherhood of men defending their country, thumping their chest and letting the Afghan citizens do their part. Doesn't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside? Apparently it does for most Americans as it did quite well at the box-office. So (my) conclusion: good entertainment for the red blooded action loving patriot who doesn't want to know why we fight but just want's to know where to shoot and to be a brother amongst men. Oorah!",6,3,5,24 March 2014
Fury," We're the good guys right?
","Fury suffers from one of the problems many American WWII movies have: the Nazi's seem more humane than the liberators. In this film there is actually an act of kindness by an SS soldier and absolutely none by our 'heroes'. The main characters are brutes bent on killing as much German soldiers as they can and OK there are some scenes where they try to expose the duality of war but in general the Yankees come of as self righteous mass murderers. On that level Saving Private Ryan was a lot better. But as you ignore this twisted morality you can say the actors (certainly Brad Pitt) are playing some bad-ass guys. The film isn't wall to wall action, but when there is, it's pretty cool. The surround sound FX are awesome and the visuals are great. For 60m$ this movie looks a lot more expensive. If you like war movies certainly check it out. Personally I liked it but I would put below favorites of mine like Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates or Inglorious Bastards.",8,3,7,18 January 2015
Mississippi Burning," Does what Selma failed to do
","Although the subject matter of this film doesn't particularly interest me I do have to say that it does more effectively convey what last years Selma couldn't about negro rights. I saw this because Alan Parker made one of my favorite movies ever (Angel Heart - but Parker also made a lot of lesser films) and because Gene Hackman -one of the most natural and effortless actors of all time- plays in it (and I rarely see a movie for the actor). Hackman plays the lead with a very young Dafoe and both do an excellent job as well as the rest of the A-level cast (R Lee Ermey, Brad Dourif, Stephen Tobolowsky, Frances McDormand & Michael Rooker). I found the movie very entertaining and it never fails to keep your attention. It's not a classic for me personally but watching these fine actors work their craft makes this a product worthy of your time if you appreciate the fine art of cinema.",7,1,1,20 July 2015
The Babadook," Nothing you haven't seen before but still well done
","The Good: this film is a very effective horror film, made very professionally for it's shoestring budget. It looks great with dark brooding sets and is at times quite scary. The lead actress does a great job. The Bad: the story (although well written) is basically still the same formula we've seen in about ever other horror film from the last 5 years. The child actor who plays the kid could have been better. Sometimes he's incredibly annoying (although he's meant to be for story purposes). This film got a lot of critical acclaim but it's maybe not all deserved imo. It still remains a great horror film so if you're a horror fan you won't be disappointed. A bit more originality could have made it a classic.",7,0,3,23 November 2014
The Danish Girl," Solid acting and great cinematography
","Though it is nominated for 4 Oscars I wasn't looking forward to seeing it. The Danish Girl seemed like the typical arty-farty Oscar fare on paper but fortunately it was better than that. The best part of the film is the acting. Eddy Redmane does a great job but I was most surprised by Alicia Vikander. She almost steals the movie though she only has a supporting role. Mattias Schoenaerts is also in it with a supporting role and I must say: that man can do just about any language and accent and make it sound completely natural. The story was not that interesting to me and is somewhat of a typical subject matter for Oscar movies (that is movies about some sort of misunderstood minority and who was the first to start the revolution if you will). That being said, it is a very good movie, superb acting but on the other hand I don't consider this a must see.",8,24,32,28 February 2016
Creed," Just another boxing film
","I was never a fan of Rocky (I've only seen the first one and I did not think it was a classic by any stretch of the imagination) and I do not like sports films nor boxing films in particular. Many though have received high praise, but to me it always seems to be the same film. The difference is made by the actors and how much empathy they can get you to feel for their character and their plight. Now Creed will mean most to people who remember Rocky and the Rocky franchise films fondly. It will be a trip down nostalgia lane seeing their childhood hero has become and old man and the son of Apollo Creed rise by the aid of Rocky. But for someone like me, who looks at it as just another boxing film it doesn't have to offer much special. The story in itself is as cliché and straightforward as they come and the acting is very good but nothing worthy of an Oscar. This film is no Shawshank redemption ladies and gents. I watched it to see if it could live up to the Oscar hype, otherwise I would have just ignored it. Should Stallone get an Oscar for this: for me, no. Should Michael B. Jordan get an Oscar for this: no, too soon. For a better role than this maybe, yes.",7,0,3,16 February 2016
About Time," An entertaining can of worms
","Making a film about time-traveling is opening a can of worms. I've seen almost every film out there about time travel: some are very accurate and some are a complete mess. This one is somewhere in between. They introduce the concept very casually to the characters in the film who aren't smart enough to ask certain questions about the rules concerning the consequences and changes it might cause...I get that this movie is first and foremost a romantic movie and time travel is only a device to prove a point but at the same time it can be a bit distracting if it doesn't work 100%. In the first half of the film the protagonist comes of as a bumbling idiot who unrightfully uses time travel to correct his impulsive mistakes, which would have been easily corrected if he just used his brain before speaking. It seems questionable in that way if he even deserves to have this power to force 'things' to go his way. Domhnall Gleeson is maybe not the best choice of actor here, Rachel McAdams does a much better job, she is instantly likable but her character seems to be written without much depth. It might seem like a bad movie judging but my rant here but actually if you look past the aforementioned shortcomings it is entertaining and the 2 hrs will fly by in no time.",7,2,4,5 January 2014
Don Jon," Recognizability
","Who else than Joseph Gordon-Levitt -one of the most versatile actors of our time- could make his directional debut about a such a controversial subject as a porn addict and make it totally work. Besides directing it he also plays Don Jon, a very macho womanizer who falls in love with Scarlett Johansson. He plays his character in a very funny and tongue in cheek way, but still believable. There are people like that out there and the recognizability of that makes it such fun to watch. I won't give away much more of the plot but I liked Levitt's first authored film a lot. Be warned though that because of the nature of the subject there might be some occasional nudity.",8,3,4,5 January 2014
The Hateful Eight," Don't believe the hype, it's okay but Tarantino can do better
","So I've finally seen this much talked about film and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The H8 is a 168 min long movie which is described as a sort of mystery thriller and a lot a noise was made (mainly by Quentin himself) when the script leaked early and therefore would harm the box office chances of this flick. The movie did indeed not make big waves money wise but that was mainly because the overly long movie does actually not amount to much story wise. In other words there is no real clue. The dialogue, normally the strongpoint of Tarantino films, is actually not that great. Conversations are drawn out without the characters actually saying anything. It does help a lot that we do get a great cast (Kurt Russel, Sam L Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh) because without them the movie would fall apart rather quickly. The film was shot on 2,76:1 70mm widescreen because retro elitist Tarantino thinks digital isn't good enough and I do have to say the snowy landscape shots look awesome but they make up only 2% of the flick. The rest of it is in a cabin where standard 35mm or even a digital camera could have perfectly captured the images. About the music I can be short: there is almost none. It' might have been composed by Moricone who unrightfully got an Oscar for it, but it does not add much here in this film. I'm glad I didn't see it on the big screen. It works just as well on the small screen, maybe even better coz you can pauze it to get more booze and a snack. So despite my rather harsh comments I would recommend it but know that this is far from Tarantino's best work.",7,210,388,6 March 2016
The Book Thief," Honest film with great performances
",In this German/US co-production we get to see the German civilian side of the WWII conflict. There is a mix of real German and English with a German accent in the movie because English actors can't speak German and the German actors can't speak English without the accent. So they all sound a bit like when someone imitates a funny jew/rabbi accent (yes really) but you get used to it pretty quickly. It's always a bit ironic when a film pimps the virtues of the written word. Certainly when it relies so heavily on the visual presentation and acting performances (which are all excellent) as this one does. I liked the film a lot but as a lot of films these days it's quite long but it's also told at a slower relaxed pace. I would certainly recommend it as it is a very honest film: it doesn't try to tear-jerk or manipulate the audience and it's a good entertaining production.,8,1,3,17 March 2014
Underworld Awakening," Wrong turn
","Although we're glad to have Kate back I have to say that they shifted very heavily to the Action genre (probably coz it was released in 3D). In the first 2 mins you get a quick recap of the other Kate-Underworld films, then a very quick exp lanation of the current story situation and then you get thrown into the action which rarely ever stops. Very little time is taken out for story, character development or background exposistion. This movie only lasts 88 mins, 10 of which are credits, so if you don't count the intro that leaves you about 75 mins of actual film of which 850 shots are VFX (which aren't bad but also not exceptional). It's nice entertainment and if you've seen the other Underworld films you'll probably also see this one but I'm not fond of the direction they've taken...",7,1,2,9 August 2013
Doctor Strange," The best Marvel movie since The Avengers and Guardians!
","I'd never heard of Doctor Strange, but neither did I know Ant-man or even Thor before they made movies of these comic book characters. Now Marvel has become such a household name and quality label that at this point people will just about watch any Marvel film thats released... ...and they won't be disappointed coz it's REALLY good. The casting of Cumberbatch was brilliant. He has the perfect combination of wittiness, arrogance, charisma and is incredibly likable and has a great sense of comedic timing. They also considered other actors (Keanu Reeves, Jake Gyllenhaal, Joaquin Phoenix, etc) for this role (and Cumberbatch almost had to skip because of his Hamlet play) but the film would not have been the same without Benedict. The film's story takes a bit of time to build Strange's character before it gets to the meat but I found it very well done and didn't feel like it slowed down the movie. Once the action starts we get amazing VFX scenes, I mean it has been a long time (could be since The Matrix came out in 1999) since I've been wowed by VFX, but this film does it! A-level flawless effects work. Made me feel a bit sorry I'd went and saw it in 2D coz those VFX scenes will probably work wondrously well in 3D or IMAX (reviews seem to confirm that). Talking about the Matrix, this film reminded me of it at times. It also has elements from Inception and probably some other films but it never felt like it ripped them off (The Matrix itself 'ripped off' many other classics). At 115 mins Dr. Strange is one of the shorter ones in the MCU but it didn't feel like it needed to be longer. I had a great time with Doctor Strange and I consider it the best since The Avengers film and Guardians of the Galaxy. It has the same light humorous tone and a great cast and awesome visuals. As you might have guessed: HIGHLY recommended!",9,1,3,2 November 2016
Interstellar," Cinema with a capital C
","I only saw the teaser for this film (for the rest I didn't watch or read anything about the film, I like to know as little as possible about a Nolan film before I see it) and it had me a bit worried: we see McConaughey as a farmer and something about a space program. For a second I was thinking it would have some similarities with the horrible 'Astronaut Farmer' film, but who are we kidding. This is Chris Nolan we are talking about and he does not disappoint. Nolan makes Cinema with a capital C. Interstellar is an epic movie about the survival of mankind, but it's also philosophical, scientific and convincingly dramatic thanks to the great performances of all actors. There are jaw-dropping shots in this film that only work on a big screen (the IMAX version is probably even more awesome) and the subwoofer rumbling of the spacecrafts made the cinema seats tremble. The drama works very well with the superb score of Hans Zimmer who got a lot of inspiration from the Koyaanisqatsi soundtrack and some from Event Horizon. The plot is incredibly well written by Nolan and his brother but it's not perfect as there are some events that happen for dramatic effect or creative license and don't always seem realistic. This film is one that scifi fans will love and should also please general audiences. The only complaint maybe is that at 170mins this isn't a short film (and there was no pause in Kinepolis) as I felt it in my legs after having to sit still so long. I very highly recommend this film. See it in the cinemas or you will surely regret it later",9,1,7,23 November 2014
Southpaw," Also worth watching if you don't like boxing
","I watch a surprising amount of sports movies for a guy who doesn't give a flying monkey about sports in general. Okay maybe not that many but I do make exceptions in certain cases. The reason I saw this one is because Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the greatest actors of his generation chose to act in it. And believe you me, Gyllenhaal lives up to his excellent reputation again, you can actually blindly go see any movie with him in it and not be disappointed. One of the most important things in a movie is that you care what happens to the characters and by casting Rachel McAdams and Gyllenhaal you'll care a lot. Boxing movies for the rest mostly follow the same pattern (if you've seen a few you know what I mean) and this one is not that different from most other except that the centerpiece of the film is not the boxing match but what goes on in this boxers life. An excellent movie and worth a watch even if you don't like sports or boxing movies.",7,1,2,24 November 2015
Ant-Man," Funnier and lighter than most Marvel films
","Once Ant-Man was in the hands of creative genius Edgar Wright. He got removed from the production most likely because he didn't get along with the Disney/Marvel suits who wanted him to bend to their rules. So enter Peyton Reed, director of Yes Man and Down with Love as the new man behind the wheel.Before the movie came out I was thinking: a tinny man, what can he ever do when you have the Avengers with all the destructive power...but they addressed and even poke fun at those preconceptions and also answer that question.Paul Rudd is cast well as the Ant-Man. He plays it with plenty of charisma and comedic flair. Michael Douglas is also pretty cool as Paul's mentor. Evangeline Lilly of lost fame plays Douglas' daughter and besides a good actress she's also easy on the eyes.The story isn't as large scale as the Avengers or the Guardians of the Galaxy but that actually is a refreshment and the film lighter and provides excellent entertainment. The VFX are also very well done as they look pretty convincing.So I would recommend you see it even if you are getting a bit tired of the constant barrage of superhero movies as it is sufficiently different and as such adds something to the Marvel universe.",8,1,4,21 November 2015
Incendies," The Root of all Evil
","A film with 8,1/10 (36000 votes) on IMDb should be an instant classic, a masterpiece of cinema, a film you will remember for the rest of your life...or so you would think. Well, no. There is a 'twist' in the story that you could say is cleverly written, it does not make up for the other defects of the film. It's slow, with the character going though to motions of their 'discovery', but none of that makes for interesting scenes. I didn't care much for the characters and certainly failed to identify or sympathize with them (a basic requirement for liking a film). The story takes place in an unidentified Middle-Eastern country (apparently they didn't want to offend any middle eastern people or they think it's all the same over there -whatever) and religion is (surprise, surprise) basically the root cause of all the evil that happens to our protagonist. The sum of all these elements does not add up to a great film. I even turned it off after 35 mins. After a few days I gathered enough courage to plow through the remainder of this film, and it does get a bit better after the slow start. My advice is: there are films you'd think are perfect but there's always such a thing as personal taste.",6,4,9,8 October 2013
Rush," Slick F1 film
","Rush is about the rivalry between James Hunt (who I've never heard of personally) and Niki Lauda leading up to the 1976 World Championship. Lauda is very accurately played by Brühl and Hemsworth is excellently cast as arrogant playboy Hunt. Ron Howard succeeds in making a visually very slick movie for the low budget of 38m$. A lot of stuff is CGI enchanced, mostly you don't notice it, but a couple of times you could notice they are in front of a bluescreen instead of in a car. They also used real cars and most of the racing shots look very real. Hans Zimmer provides a very functional score that doesn't draw to much attention to itself. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I would certainly recommend it to any car enthusiast or F1 fan but I won't put it in my 2013 top 5 film list. Like a lot of movies about sports and rivalry therein it feels like it follows a certain formula and unfolds in a very straightforward way. This keeps it from reaching 'instant classic' status, but don't let that keep you from seeing this fine film",8,1,1,5 January 2014
Oblivion," Scifi as it should be
","Oblivion, Joseph Kosinski's follow-up feature to Tron Legacy proves again that he is a great visual director. Our desolate planet looks gorgeous and all the tech gear looks very sleek and futuristic. The VFX are used in service of the story and the craftsmanship is absolutely excellent, not one single shot looks fake! People who love and know the magnificent Tron Legacy soundtrack will notice a certain resemblance here, but this is certainly not a bad thing, rather the opposite. The story is sort of a composition of elements you might have seen in other scifi movies, but this is not always avoidable and not really a problem. The style and execution are brilliant so I'm very much looking forward to Kosinski's next film. Highly recommended!",9,2,4,9 August 2013
The Revenant," A Cinematic Tour de force
","The Revenant really is a cinematic tour de force. The landscapes and vistas in this film are just gorgeous to look at but at the same time it's a very raw, gritty and gruesome experience. I think the Revenant puts a final stop to pointless arguments that 35mm film is better than digital cameras. Originally planned to be shot on film they decided to shoot 60% on Arri Alexa XT's and 40% on Alexa 65 (65mm size 6.5K sensor). The colors are vibrant but natural, and the play of light and darkness is sublime. Also the absence of film grain (an advantage of shooting digital) removes the veil between the audience and the captured images. I bet when this comes out on Ultra-HD in HDR that this will be a reference disc often used to demo the capabilities of those OLED flatscreens. Soundwise we're in for a treat as well. The rumbling of waterfalls, the roars of the bear and rustling of the wind through the trees is brilliantly mixed and mastered. There are 630 VFX shots in this film and I can tell you, you might spot a few but most are perfectly executed and absolutely invisible. The scene with the bear, might god...looks so real. As for the acting, an Oscar well deserved for Leo. And Tom Hardy is quite excellent as well. So a movie I very highly recommend, though it is as harsh as it is beautiful, it surely is one to put on the bucket list.",9,1,1,11 April 2016
Ender's Game," Needs an extended version
","The box-office failure of big budget (110m$) book adaptation 'Ender's Game' doesn't bode well for the future of my favorite movie genre. Writer Orson Scott Card has had many offers since the book release in 1985 to turn it into a film. He rejected many of them because of creative differences and because most Studios insisted on making Ender older (in the book he's 6 to 10 years old). There were plans in 2003 by Warner Brothers to let Wolfgang Petersen have a go at it with a script written by Card himself. Card's script was a fusion of 'Ender's Game' and 'Ender's Shadow'. In 2010 Gavin Hood got attached as director and screenwriter and the script became based on the first book again with plans to make it into a franchise or a TV series if successful. Unfortunately EG made only 112m$ worldwide (although it opened first place in the US with 27m$) so all future plans have been put on ice. It's really a shame because as far as science fiction flicks go this really is one of the better ones. The VFX were done by Digital Domain who also co-financed the film and they look absolutely stunning. This film will a good 4K showcase Blu-ray when they finalize the format at the end of 2014. The film follows the book quite closely but because of the time constraints of the film medium a lot of events had to be compressed and some subplots where eliminated. 113 mins really is too short, an extra 40 mins or so would have let more room to expand on Ender's training etc. Altogether I think most fans of the book will be happy with the end result but it it just lacks the depth the book had to offer. So hopefully they make a 3 hour extended version (depending on how much material they shot) on BD to give the story more time to breathe.",8,14,22,2 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The best one yet
",It's been a while I've seen a superhero movie in the cinema's because there are just to many of them and they were not always very interesting. For this ultimate X-men movie I made an exception: it had great trailers and it combines the excellent cast of X-men First Class with the veterans from the first X-men films. Time travel is used to alter the past to get a better future. As time travel is impossible it doesn't completely make sense plot wise (it never does). The movie mainly plays in the 70s so you could say it's more of a direct sequel to X-men First Class.There are also plenty of references to the other X-men films so fans of the series should get their money's worth. Unlike other superhero movies we don't get wall-to-wall destruction (although the action and VFX that are there are very well done and spectacular) but more focus plot development and characters. The only downside maybe is the implausible quest of getting along with the humans despite their urge to destroy the mutants in every film and the sometimes repetitive speeches that go with it. That aside I have to say it might be the best X-men film yet. There is also a small teaser of things to come after the credits.,9,0,2,30 May 2014
The Conjuring 2," Does nothing new but it does what it does very, very well
","Honestly, I was not planning on seeing this film. You know, another haunted house film? What can they do that hasn't been done a 1000 times before right? Well, enter James Wan: he makes a flick for some 10's of millions (40 here) and it makes hundreds at the box office (320 to be exact). Why is that? Coz they work, that's why! So I saw it because it got good reviews but even then I was full of suspicion. But yeah, like I said before: it works. Not because it really does something new -it doesn't- but because it does what it does very well. The movie feels fresh and entertaining and never bores despite its 2 hour running time. But if you're sick of haunted house films and never want to see one again I won't blame ya, but if you do want to see one again then see this one alright :)",8,1,2,11 September 2016
Inside Out," About emotions but not emotional
","This is a tough one to judge: on one hand I praise Pixar for trying to make a film out of a rather unconventional idea. Monsters (2001) did this too and was also from the same director. I can image it's hard to predict if you can make such an idea into a great movie. Well it turns out it's rather difficult. The biggest problem this movie has is the characters. They are certainly not as good as those in the Toy Story movies, they just don't seem to be as likable even tough Pixar really tries to make you like 'em. What I did like was that the film sometimes felt a bit bleaker and surrealistic (a kind of Alice in Wonderland feel) than most other Pixar flicks. It does seem strange that a film which revolves around emotions struggles a bit with just that as it has difficulty emotionally involving the audience. I certainly don't think it's a bad film, in my book it's still way better than those lame Cars films but it's not in the Pixar top list.",7,5,29,23 October 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Overextended eye-candy
","Peter Jackson continues smearing the 'Hobbit' out over another 2 hour and 41 minute sandwich. There is just not enough happening, they linger to long on nonessential scenes, there is too much dialogue without adding much content. It feels a bit like the Star Wars prequels: it's made by the same skillful people but it's just not as good as the original, there's something missing. What the film is very good at is serving up pure eye-candy. The attention to detail in the costumes, props, sets and VFX is mind-boggling. Howard Shore again provides the score but besides hints of the LOTR theme it's just not that memorable. If you've seen the other LOTR films you're not gonna skip this one so I don't need to convince anyone I guess. I just hope they don't make an extended version for the Blu Ray because this one already feels overextended as it is...",8,0,1,5 January 2014
Frozen," A classic Disney Fairytale
",If you accept it for what it is (an animated fairy tale musical) it's actually pretty good. Disney Animation Studios who struggled with computer animation in their first films has finally matched Pixar in animation quality: the snow/ice environments are gorgeously rendered and the character animation is just excellent. Disney drew inspiration from Austrian/Scandinavian countries for the look of Arendell. The story is loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Snow Queen'. There's also a good mix of comedy and drama with a great voice cast. Turns out Kristen Bell is not only beautiful but also has a great singing voice. I'm fairly certain the 'best original song' Oscar will go to Frozen. Though it might not be for everyone it will certainly appeal to people who loved Disney's previous classics and for Disney it was a return to a winning formula as Frozen almost made 1 billion bucks at the box office.,8,3,5,2 March 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Enjoyable feel good movie
","Ben Stiller is an actor I can't stand. He has almost no comedic talent, is not a great director (Cable Guy, Zoolander) so I was skeptical about this production to say the least. Surprisingly TSLoWM turned out quite well. Stiller plays a Negative (film) Asset manager who has to retrieve a lost negative for the final print cover of LIFE magazine. The film is an ode to (analog) photography and LIFE magazine and it's motto (applicable the Walter's character). The (35mm) photography looks gorgeous and Visual Effects are used sparingly to enhanced the great visuals. The music also works effectively to enhanced the mood of the film without drawing explicit attention. The lesson about life is somewhat typical for these kinds of movies and is therefore not entirely convincing but the film is actually very enjoyable to watch and probably Stiller's best work. Maybe not a classic but it will make you feel good, is a joy for the eyes and if nothing else it will surely make you want to travel more ;)",8,0,0,5 April 2014
22 Jump Street," Starts out okay...
","I had been warned about this film. It did start out okay with self-reflecting jokes about it being the same as the first time and stuff and them looking like narcs in college. But then they go off into these awkward scenes that go on way too long like most American comedies seem to do these days (the Heat etc.). Same can be said about the film itself: Do we really need it to be 112 mins? It could have been easily cut down to 85 or 90 mins. I never liked Jonah Hill but after 'The Wolf of Wall street' he was scoring points. Points he lost completely after this flick! I'm back to hating him again. Tatum plays the dumb guy, but they lay it on way too thick (Cate Blanchet / Carte Blanche joke? Give me a break). A shorter film with a better script and better written comedy would have been a lot more enjoyable. I did laugh at the 'Mercedes' character who keeps insulting Jonah Hill on him looking old. Judging by the credits I would think they didn't plan a sequel but I quickly checked on IMDb and there it is: 23 jump street. Get ready for tons more lame and awkward comedy, ye be warned ;)",6,1,3,26 October 2014
Lincoln," Butt-kicking for goodness!
","Daniel Day-Lewis outperforms himself again this time as Lincoln. The film focuses heavily on Amendment 13 which gets rid of slavery but serves mainly as a device to end the war. There's endless political blabbering (well written mind you) concerning the passing of this amendment and the behind-the-scenes mechanics of it. You'll get some insight into Lincoln's personal life but unexpectedly he's portrayed as a man who kicks ass for goodness, a veritable saint. As much as I enjoyed this well made film I couldn't help but think that this was a product of the Americans obsession with their own culture and history, and for me as a European it just doesn't seem all that important. We know all how it turned out in the end, didn't we :)",6,1,3,9 August 2013
Evil Dead," Humorless
","Same story, but much more bloody and humorless. That's not to say it's a bad film, but despite it's name it's not an Evil Dead film either. Some scenes mimic Japanese horror flicks like The Ring and the excessive gore and violence is copied from the SAW legacy. But if you're gonna make a bleak and serious horror movie you have to go all the way -which the French have done very well the last couple of years- but there it falls short. The young actors are just uncharismatic zombie fodder (you won't care if they live) who can't replace the memory of Bruce Campell (who got a nice cheque as the producer on this film sellout). The closest thing I've seen to Evil Dead is from Mr. Raimi himself: Drag Me to Hell. Better watch that if haven't seen it yet instead of this film.",6,1,3,9 August 2013
Elysium," Matt Damon in space
","District 9 was a brilliant film and so a tough act to follow up. Elysium is visually and stylistically very similar to D9, but with a different story. The plot strongly reminded me of Battle Angel with influences from other scifi pop culture like Terminator, Mass Effect etc. The VFX are incredibly well done and very believable. The cinematography is mainly hand-held which gives you more the feeling that you're there and makes it feel more dynamic. Casting Matt Damon as the lead seems a bit odd, and although he doesn't do a bad job he feels a bit out of place. They also asked Eminem for the lead part but that would definitely have been worse. Jodie Foster plays the heavy but she has a British-like accent and she does seem to overact a little bit. Sharlto Copley on the other hand was well cast as the lunatic merc. So to round up, I found it a very enjoyable film and it was about what I expected but the plot could have been fleshed out a bit better, the characters seems a bit flat and the film lacks heart for lack of a better term. His next film 'Chappie' will be a scifi comedy with a robot in the lead and will be loosely based on his 2003 short Tetra Vaal. Jackman, Weaver, Copley and Dev Patel have already been confirmed as cast so this should be interesting :)",7,0,0,2 December 2013
Les Misérables," The audience is miserable
","Musicals are not my thing. Up until now I have seen only 2 that worked: Moulin Rouge and Romeo + Julliet (yes both Baz Luhrman's). With all the positive reviews and the high IMDb score I was willing to give it a fair chance...but after 5,5 mins I had reached the limits of my patience, I HAD to turn it off. This is just unbearable! Do they really have to sing EVERY SINGLE LINE of dialogue? No wonder this thing clocks in at 158 mins. It's better to burst out into song for no reason then to continuously pound people in the face with them. Some performers are great actors, sure, but that doesn't mean they have a great singing voice. Be realistic, no one is good at everything. I guess this film has a certain audience (it made 433 m$ worldwide) but I'm pretty certain I'm not one of them.",4,0,2,9 August 2013
Steve Jobs," We should be making movies about great men, not scumbag computer-salesmen
","I was actually expecting it to be good, or at least a lot better then the stupid 'Jobs' flick with Kutcher. It's directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. These guys have proved to be some of the most majorly talented people in Hollywood. Here's the problem: they were trying to find the human angle in a biopic about a guy mostly remembered for his company or the products it cranked out. This angle is his daughter Lisa. To glue it all together they use the product launches of 3 major Apple products as a backdrop. On paper that might have sounded quite brilliant but in reality it's not. Why not? Because Steve Jobs was an asshole. The film does not try to sweep that under the carpet, no sir. It actually is quite proactive in correctly pointing out what a miscreant Mr. Jobs is/was. Jobs never gave credit where credit was due (Woz asks Steve to acknowledge the Apple 2 team and he refuses - several times), he was a tyrant who pressured people unto creating (supposedly) great things while he himself did nothing (he explains that in the films as being the orchestrator and the engineers are the orchestra). There is a scene with Woz (he did always seem to be the most rational guy in the movie as well as in real life) where he says to Steve Jobs: You can't write code. You're not an engineer. You're not a designer. You can't put a hammer to a nail. Jobs was just a Snake Oil salesman, he did not change the world. He did not even made revolutionary products, he made things that smarter people thought of before, and he stole it and marketed them as his own. The thing that should make him more human (the relationship with his daughter) makes him come off as an even bigger douchebag. He denies being her father (knowing full well he is), is not very friendly to her or her mother. Refuses to pay her 25K $ tuition while he has millions in the bank. Look, I understand biopics about great people who accomplished great things need to be made, but here's the reason why I dislike this movie despite them not holding back on showing Jobs' unpleasant side: he does NOT deserve it. Steve Jobs was no creative genius, nor a good father or even a pleasant guy. He was a bully who pushed people with much more skill then him to make a product he presented as being his brainchild. Steve Jobs sold himself as much as his products by giving no-one credit. But are these the sort of people we want to make films about? I don't think so. And the human angle...sorry but the film turned out to be an overly long yammering sessions between Jobs and his wife, daughter and coworkers. And instead of feeling compassion or even empathy for this scumbag, I felt contempt and boredom. This is not the sort of films we want to give Oscars to, I don't care who made them or played in them. This film (at the moment of writing) made even less money than the Kutchter vehicle 'Jobs', which clearly points out people DO NOT care about egomaniac 'creative geniuses' like Jobs. Heck, 2 days after he croaked the world had already forgotten him.",5,3,6,5 February 2016
12 Years a Slave," Worst case slave scenario
","Are they going to give Oscars to the subject (abolishment of slavery) or to the film itself for it's own merits? 'Based on a true story' and about black slaves - BAM! Oscar guaranteed. The same used to be the case when you made a film about mentally retarded people even when the film itself was also retarded. Those guilt ridden white suits dare NOT give it an Oscar right? Or maybe it's a trade-off: they get to use the word 'nigger' (otherwise known as the n-word) as much as they want in a movie and in return black people get an Oscar or two. 'The Help' which was nothing more than a polite regurgitation of an old sore and was hardly worth an Oscar so I wasn't expecting much from this one. Fortunately it's actually a good film with an A-list cast. But as movies are heightened reality we do get an overly racist and sadistic plantation owner (great performance by Michael Fassbender) just as every German in a WWII film is a jew-hating killing machine who deserves to die in the most horrible way. Hollywood just likes good and evil to be nicely separated. They gave an Oscar to Ralph Fiennes as a sadistic camp leader in Schindlers List, so I expect the same for Fassbender here folks. With all this being said, despite it's 134 min runtine, it will pass in no time as it is just incredibly well made and is worth your time. And it does give you a good idea what the worst case scenario could have been for a black slave in the 19th century.",7,1,4,2 March 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Go see it while you still can
","Sometimes you just know which films aren't going to make their money back. Edge of Tomorrow is one of these films. Not because I thought it was going to be bad but because it is a high concept scifi film and audiences rarely connect to these kinds of films. The trailer didn't show much (apparently audiences hate that or find it confusing or they assume the whole movie is like that) but you can't give it all away, they already gave away too much. Idealy you should go see these films without any advance knowledge. Edge of Tomorrow is based on a Japanese graphic novel 'All you need is kill' (that was also going to be the original title of the film - a better one I think) and in essence is a combination of Groundhog day and Starship Troopers. The exoskeleton suits are actually very similar to the suits from the Starship Troopers book but weren't used in the 1997 film because it was too expensive. The time-loop concept is responsible for some great comedy (cfr Groundhog Day) and Cruise was certainly a perfect cast here. The film is very focused on the purpose of the time loop (that is what the film is about innit) but that doesn't always leave much room for sidetracking. That results in a very fast paced but incredibly well made film. The VFX are state of the art and there is plenty of action. I can highly recommend this film. It was very risky to make a 178m$ groundhog day film which unfortunately will fail at the box-office because audiences besides scifi aficionados aren't ready for it. If you want to see it in the theater (which I recommend) you'd better hurry coz it won't play long.",9,8,15,30 May 2014
Whiplash," I was wrong
",At first I was thinking: another one of those overrated films that gets hyped everywhere but probably won't live up to it once I see it. Well I was wrong. This movie is pretty awesome. Truly great movies can be about a (on paper boring) subject like a Jazz drum player and still be amazing. J.K. Simmons plays a demonic music instructor (he makes Gny. Sgt. Hartman from Full Metal Jacket seem like a sweet little angel) who drills conservatory students to become masters in their craft. Whiplash got 5 Oscar nominations and 'Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role' can certainly go the J.K. for me. I highly recommend you check this movie out!,9,0,2,18 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," DiCaprio and Scorsese make an excellent team
","Martin Scorsese is an actor's director and my god does it show. 'Wolf' is perfectly cast even down to the extra's. Every actor brings their A-game here. The film lasts over 3 hrs but trust me it is time well spent. Marty takes time to let scenes develop, to let actor's play of each other, to let the script breathe. Despite (or thx to?) all the profanity (506 curse words) you can't help but love the cool dialogue and conversations. Nudity and debauchery have never been framed more gloriously with sweeping camera moves, strategic slomo and creative shot compositions. This film is just so much fun: I've laughed more with this film than almost any other film intended as a comedy I've seen the last 10 years. It's too bad it didn't win any Oscars because it surely deserved them. But I guess that won't bother Marty or anyone else who will see this film. 'Wolf' might be the only true spiritual successor to one of my other all time favorites 'Wall Street' (forget Wall Street 2). DiCaprio and Scorsese make an excellent team and I hope we will get to see a lot more masterpieces from them in the future!",10,2,9,17 March 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," An experience as much as a film
","In Birdman actors play a version of themselves. Keaton plays a washed up ex superhero movie star who wants to gain recognition and respect as an artist and actor by doing a deep Broadway play. Norton plays a self righteous and difficult to work with talented actor (which is the reputation he has in real life). Iñárritu and his DP did a technical tour de force by making the film (appear) as one shot (with the help of the VFX guys no doubt) but that alone makes viewing this film an extraordinary experience. The score consists only of a guy playing drums (you actual see him in the background several times) in different tempos but it works very well - though that makes the score more supporting and less interesting to listen to on it's own (like the score of Interstellar e.g.). This film which was Keaton's first lead role in 6 years will surely put him back on the map in Hollywood. As much as I liked this movie it was not as good as Nightcrawler because of several reasons: the film is a bit long and Gylenhaals performance is more enjoyable then Keaton's so the Oscars can go to Nightcrawler for me. But certainly check it out, it's as much an experience as it is a film!",8,2,6,8 February 2015
The Big Short," Those 130 mins will fly by in no time
",Movies about the financial world are not easy to make. You have to ensure that they are entertaining but still contain enough 'techno financial babble' to make it believable and still be understandable enough for the general public. For these reasons I feared 'The Big Short' might have been a bore but I was actually surprised how good it was. The movie contains a lot of humor and has a high 'fun factor' while the characters still use plenty of sector specific terms to make them believable as financial experts. 'Margin Call' avoided this mostly and had one of those exposition scenes where they explain to the monkeys in plain English and with daft metaphors what they are talking about. In this film they explain some of the more specific terms with a funny clip (here is Margot Robby in bathtub explaining C.D.O.'s) and that works incredibly well. The acting is top notch (I loved Christian Bale's eccentric Metalhead hedge fund manager character). Steve Carell again proves he can do more than comedic characters while the unknown supporting cast is also superb. The Big Short's 130 minutes ran by in no time as it has no problems whatsoever keeping you interested. This is one of my Oscar favorites for this year and I hope it rakes up some golden statues for the well deserved 5 nominations.,9,0,1,28 February 2016
The Conjuring," Alone in the Dark
","I won't lie: you're not going to see anything new in this film, in fact it follows the 'haunted house' formula almost exactly to the letter. But...if you should see only one of these type of films, you'd better make it this one. It's well crafted and has the all-important creepy atmosphere, the feeling that something evil is out there. I watched it alone in complete darkness with the volume cranked up, but even that wasn't enough to make me jump out my seat (it's probably me), but if you're squeamish, you'll have plenty of scares. I still think 'The Ring' (US version) is maybe the most creepy film I ever saw, but the Conjuring would certainly make it to my top 5.",8,0,1,16 October 2013
Fifty Shades of Grey," Twilight is still worse
","Saw this to see what all the fuss was all about. The smart marketing guys and galls at Universal targeted this flick at women coz it opened at Valentine's Day and women crave roman at this time. This film is supposed to be romantic -and it sort of is- but at the same time it incorporates BDSM into the storyline (trust me, there is no BDSM in this film, very soft porn at best maybe) which is always good for controversy and to spike curiosity. A lot of criticism on this film was about the lead actress not being a strong female character, but that argument is moot. This film is supposed to be a female fantasy of a strong dominant rich alpha male who sweeps them of their feet. But it also tries to sell the not entirely convincing story of a tormented man with a socially unaccepted obsession. There is another film on this subject called 'Secretary' which did a lot better job at telling this story. I won't spoil anything but there is a comical scene (it's not intended to be funny) about a contract negotiation where words are used you normally don't hear in American mainstream cinema. So maybe we should be commending them in not trying to make a romantic comedy done a 1000 times before but do something a bit more dramatic. The problem is that it's not convincing, the dialogue is sometimes poorly written and it's basically a movie with an identity crisis, it tries to be more things than it is. they should have either gone full-out dramatic and focused on the story and made it darker and less mainstream or made it a flatout romance. In any case, it's not as bad as those twilight movies were and Dakota Johnson is quite nice to look at.",6,1,3,2 May 2015
The Wolverine," A Worthy X-Men film
","The previous film 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' left everyone very disappointed (including me) and almost ruined the franchise so they had to make an effort with this one to get the fans back on-board. 'The Wolverine' is certainly a much better film where they put the story more than the action and VFX in front. It's a sequel to X3 (where the X-Men disbanded) in which Logan struggles with is immortality and ends up getting involved with a Japanse company promising him to relieve him of this burden. The story and character centric approach does mean that the pace is much slower and sometimes they spend just too much time on the characters without really adding much depth. Cutting 15 to 20 mins out of this 138 min movie would certainly have helped. The action sequences we do get are well done with excellent VFX and they do try to be inventive and show some stuff we haven't seen before. Altogether a worthy X-Men film but not the best in series. BTW at the end of the film there is a short scene with Xavier and Magneto which sets us up for 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', a film of which expect allot more and which hopefully will be the best in the series, the trailers look interesting to say the least :)",7,4,9,10 November 2013
Monsters University," Cheated
","There was a time when whichever film Pixar made, it never failed to impress me. That time has sadly passed. Cars was the first disappointment. Cars 2 just sucked. Luckily these were the exceptions. Toy Story 3, WALL-E & Brave were all excellent! The problem with Monster U is that it's just a plain and simple highschool movie, but with monsters (duh!). So a real cookie cutter story. The animation is gorgeous but it has gotten to a point where cartoon-like characters look as good as they are ever going to look if you don't want them to look photo-realistic. Great for kids I guess, but adults do make up a large part of the Pixar audience and story wise I feel a bit cheated...",7,0,0,16 October 2013
Thor: The Dark World," The better Superhero film
","Disney might think this film made more money than Thor 1 because of it's synergy with the other Marvel superhero films and while that might be true to a certain extent I think it's probably because Thor 2 is simply a much better film than Thor 1. What it does have in common with the Avengers e.g. is an excellent balance of humor, action, effects and drama. We have arrived at a point where VFX can't hardly improve anymore but in The Dark World they pulled out all the stops: we get gorgeous vistas, battles and large scale destruction effects and not a single shot looks fake. Chris Hemsworth also seems to be getting more familiar with his character as his performance has certainly improved. I was getting pretty sick of superhero movies but I'm glad to say this one has restored my faith (partially). For me The Dark World is certainly better than any of the Iron Man films. Recommended!",9,2,4,9 February 2014
Lucy," Braindead popcorn entertainment
","Maybe it's ironic that to enjoy a film about using 100% of your brain capacity you best turn it almost completely off. Johansson plays a woman who gets forced to smuggle a kilo of CPH4 (a new drug) in her stomach, but it rips open and she gets a overdose which gives her the ability to gradually use more of her brain capacity. It all sounds plausible up to here but then it goes completely of the rails. I won't mention the things she can do with her mind in this film, but let's just say that they are not very realistic or scientifically sound. It's all just very silly and ridiculous and you have to just go with it. The film was very successful in the cinemas, my guess is because it's a very international film. There are Americans, Frenchmen, Italians, Germans, Koreans and China-men in it. Everybody likes to see themselves in a movie right? The film most resembles a scifi version of the Transporter films which Besson also produced. You could say Chris Nolan makes Scifi with a capital S and Besson scifi with a small s. It's not bad but don't don't think about it to much, it's just popcorn cinema.",7,3,8,23 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Great movie that should please fans and everyone else actually
","32 years I've waited for this film...OK, actually 10 years since Episode III. Well, OK less coz we only knew in 2012 after the Disney takeover that there would be another one. Lucas always said he was done. So here it finally is. Grab a beer, this is going to be a long one smile emoticonMaking a new film for a franchise that is considered to be a religion by some and that has a legion of fans who are going to pick it apart is no small task. For this reason J.J. Abrams at first refused the directorial job but eventually got convinced by Kathleen Kennedy (now head of Lucasfilm and Spielbergs wife) to do it. Since the news of Episode VII being in the making I have gone out of my way to avoid any news, trailers or leaks about the movie. When I saw The Phantom Menace in 1999 I had seen so many clips and read so many stuff online (and internet was then not what it is now) that when I eventually saw the film it added almost nothing and was quite a disappointment (also because it was bad).For The Force Awakens I had the pleasure of seeing it without any previous knowledge - the way I prefer to see all movies these days. So first off: it is a good movie. It's way better than those prequels and should please almost everyone. Abrams chose to do everything with practical effects or so they want us to believe, coz it still has 2100 VFX shots. What he means -just as was the case for Mad Max- is that the sets and most stuff the actors interact with is practical (or real). Most spaceships, aliens larger than humans, sets in the background and so on are CGI. And kudos to both: you can almost never tell when something transitions from a real set or animatronic to CGI and so it should be. In the prequels which I've watched again on Blu-ray it was all too clear when something was CG and lots of shots looked fake or badly integrated with the live action.No cost was spared to make The Force Awakens: 200 m$ went to the production of the film, and thanks to the use of unknown actors most money is on the screen. Disney threw even more money at the marketing (223m$) which the Disney Marketing machine spent well coz unless you lived under a rock you must have been aware a new Star Wars film was coming. The use of all these practical sets and grittier VFX were done to make a return to the used universe we all know and love from the Classic Trilogy. Everything is more tangible and real. What JJ Abrams also brings to the table is his expertise with more immersive action and shot design. The action is absolutely spectacular. What Abrams also brings is his focus on characters, but at the cost of depth. They probably wanted to avoid the over-exposition form the Prequels but a bit more background should sometimes have helped.The biggest strength of Episode VII is also it's weakness: it sometimes too similar to the Classic Trilogy but does manage to stand on it's own as a new chapter in the franchise. The fact that it is breaking all box-office records proves that nobody needs to be convinced to see it and that is obviously well liked. It is actually not a requirement to have seen the original films to follow the plot of this one - it is intended to bring Star Wars to a new generation - but it is surely a lot of fun an nostalgia for those who have.The question remains what Disney is intending to do with Star Wars. There is a real chance they are going to keep cranking out a new film each year (mainline and spin-off) as they can go any direction they want and those films are going to keep generating money if they keep up the quality level (and they sure are throwing a lot of talent at it) very much like is the case with the Marvel films. George Lucas made an industry out of Star Wars but Disney is going to take it to unprecedented levels. I'm glad everyone is getting the chance to become a fan but with Disney it might get out of hand. I'll be watching them very closely.",9,4,21,24 December 2015
The Purge," Social Consequences
","The social consequences of permitting murder and unrestrained violence one night a year would be very far reaching. Although we get some info on that via background newscasts, the film focuses on what this very night brings for a certain family. Produced by Jason Blum, who very successfully launched a series of scary movies (Indisious, Sinister, Paranormal Activity,...) who all made a ton of money, but were made for a budget no higher than 5 m$. I liked the movie, it was well made, but it could have explored other interesting aspects of this premise. The Purge 2 is already announced, but they will probably make a similar movie with other characters instead of trying to expand this interesting fictional world.",7,1,2,8 October 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Definitely and improvement
","Definitely and improvement upon the first movie: we have a lot more beautiful wide shots with very decent VFX while the first one used to many close-up shots and had clearly cheaper effects to save on budget. While still lacking in depth compared to the book the story feels less compressed but the focus is on the main core characters and some side characters get neglected or eliminated. While I was reading the book I thought that some scenes might come of as very cliché in the film and they do, while in the book you get the characters thoughts which makes it all seems less shallow. Altogether I liked it but I just failed to connect with it: it does seems like a good screen translation of the book but still it feels like it's just not epic, not a classic. I never had a 'wow' moment or never felt blown away. I don't completely get the success of the series as there is nothing really special about it...",7,1,14,26 January 2014
Deadpool," The anti-superhero superhero movie
","I was very curious about and eagerly awaiting to see this film as the reviews about this one were overly positive despite some criticism left and right. Well I can tell you right of the bat: this movie is fracking awesome! So the naysayers were dead wrong (pun intended). It was a very bold move putting the same actor who played a much despised version of Deadpool in X-Men Origins in a completely different movie. But they play it very smart: deadpool is a smart-mouth character and says basically everything what he (and the audience) is thinking. This makes for some very good jokes and the humor (though some might call it crude or a bit offensive) is just excellent and works great! As terrible as Reynolds was in Origins, here he embodies the character perfectly. The script is written very well and the director (a director and creative producer for CGI shortfilms and cinematics at Blur Studios) clearly understands the material and has knack for bringing it to the screen in the right way. You could say this is the anti-superhero superhero movie. After all the 'straight' superhero flicks of which we might have seen too many, this is a fresh breeze and welcome addition to the genre. So if you see one superhero movie this year see Deadpool. If you are sick of or hate superhero movies this is also right up your alley. Very highly recommended!",9,3,11,28 April 2016
Cloud Atlas," Watch something you hate for a change!
","If this film does one things it's show off what state-of-the-art make-up artistry can do: a select all-star cast plays a ton of different characters across six different timelines which are all interwoven and interconnected. The plot (and film) is meant to be epic -it does look it- but it doesn't feel like that to me. Somehow despite all the excellent VFX, make-up, acting and poetry-like dialogue it fails to connect emotionally. It is however commendable that they at least try to engage the audience with a more complex story than say robots and screaming teenagers, but the utter failure of this movie at the box office doesn't bode well for the more intellectual type of scifi entertainment -even if it doesn't fire on all cylinders like this one. Even if you might end up hating it I would recommend spending the 3 hours coz it might be a long time before we see something similar again :/",7,1,2,9 August 2013
Minions," Sure, don't see it. You'll be the only one...
","Stuart, Kevin & Bob are just about household names by now. Who doesn't know these lovable banana craving midget freaks who speak in a gibberish language which seems to be composed of Spanish, French, Indian and English? since Despicable Me 1 came out the popularity of these creatures has been steadily growing. For Minions Universal pulled out all stops: the combined advertisement value of all promotions done by Universal's partners for this movie is about 600 million $. The faces of these critters could be seen on 500 million chiquita bananas, boxes of cereal, whatever you could think of they were on it. So unless you've been hiding under a rock for the last year you've probably heard of 'the minions'. Now with all this anticipation the film has large shoes to fill. Though I seriously enjoyed this movie I have to say that it can't match the heavyweights in the animation genre created by Pixar. Those movies work better on an emotional and storytelling level. Minions as you would expect has a story but it is nothing more than a vehicle for these yellow monkeys to do silly stuff and to goof off. And that they do very well. The minions have become icons -like Mickey Mouse- who will long be remembered after this movie has been forgotten because they will live on through the merchandise produced by the 850 manufacturers with whom Universal made licensing deals. So do I have to recommend this film? Probably not, coz in a couple of years there won't be many people left on this planet who haven't seen it yet...",8,1,3,22 October 2015
Warcraft," Visually impressive but slow and underdevelopped
","As far as computer game movies go it's one of the better ones, but as most game movie are total sh1t that isn't saying much... I had very high hopes for this one as the director is no one less then Duncan Jones, director of gems like 'Moon' and 'Source Code'. Jones also claims to be a Warcraft fan and the meaty 160m$ budget should alow to visualize most they can think of without monetary constraints. Well, first the good things: the movie looks pretty awesome. The cinematography is great, the colors and production design are very consistent with the game and the CGI Orcs (courtesy of ILM) are almost photoreal and neatly integrated into the live action footage. So an A+ for eye candy. But that's where the good news stops. The movie plot is just to thin for a 123 minute movie and there are so many scenes where nothing is happening. Characters are just talking their face off but they aren't saying anything useful or aren't advancing the plot. The characters themselves are rather shallow. Sometimes when they die you won't care one bit. The Orc Durotan and Garona are fleshed out the best, but the humans are one sad cardboard bunch. This as you can imagine makes the movie a bit boring and quite slow at times. There seems very little at stake and almost not tension buildup. Has Duncan Jones actually seen his own previous movies? Jones said this is supposed to be a franchise but it should have gotten a better start to keep people interested. If they make a sequel it will be for the Chinese I'm sure.",7,2,7,12 June 2016
13 Hours," Patriotic, militaristic and too long
","The original cut of the film was 4 hours long. They 'managed' to cut it down to 145 minutes, the length that most Michael Bay films seem to have but it's still too long. Cutting another 25 minutes would have made it snappier. '13 Hours' is a rather patriotic flick about soldiers protecting a CIA compound in Libia after an ambassador is killed. The characters are not very properly introduced or fleshed out so you won't care much about them. They use a lot of military slang which might help to make it sound more authentic it also adds to the confusion. The battle scenes are in Bay's tradition filmed in a very chaotic fashion, sometimes it's difficult to see what's going on. In reality it probably was that way but it doesn't have to be for the spectators. All in all it's an okay film -I wasn't bored or anything- but it feels too patriotic (the word 'American' is used plenty) and military centric (the diplomats and chiefs come off as incompetent nerds while the soldiers save the day).",6,1,6,29 May 2016
The Martian," A great looking feel-good scifi flick
","The film is NOT called Bring Him Home in case you were wondering. 78 year old Ridley Scott returns to science fiction, the genre he is best known for (Alien/Blade Runner/Prometheus). Though this scifi is much more based on real world science of the near future (2030) than the aforementioned movies. The book on which it's based got a lot of critical acclaim but I didn't read it so I can't say how well the story made the translation to the big screen. The Martian is a rather uplifting -yes dare I say feel good- film despite the apparently grim fate that befalls Mark Whatley (the astronaut stranded on Mars played by Matt Damon). You could say it's a testament to the resourcefulness of humans in dire situations and how you have to keep a positive attitude and not give in in spite of all the hardship that comes your way. Visually the movie is -as most Ridley Scott films are- pure eye-candy. The VFX looks hyperreal and are top of the line and the cinematography is superb. The music is mostly disco music but there is a reason for that in the story and it actually works well as a comedic effect. The film is actually similar to Apollo 13 which was better but was also based on true events. The Martian is a bit long at 141 mins and there is maybe a bit to much problem solving and sometimes not enough character background (e.g. what motivates Whatley to survive?). A very good film and worth the trip to the cinemas. It does however feels like it is lacking something to make it to classic status.",8,4,9,3 November 2015
