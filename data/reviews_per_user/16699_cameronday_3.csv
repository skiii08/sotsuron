10 Cloverfield Lane," Could Have Been So Much More...
","This movie shocked everyone when they found out about it... 2 months ago and now it's finally here. Cloverfield (2008) feels like it was yesterday when it hit theaters riding on the back of the found footage film type. Without spoiling the movie, 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) is not a sequel and really feels like it's in the same universe but maybe different galaxies.Right from the get-go, the film holds you in suspense. After the car accident, you are fondled into the claustrophobic bomb shelter with two men who claim the outside world was infected with a widespread chemical attack. But when things go from bad to worse in the bomb shelter. Tensions rise as you begin to finish the jigsaw puzzle of how Michelle got down into the shelter (Reference to the movie). However the ending to me was a let down.Before I begin on the ending, yes I know that opinions are divided. A love it or hate it type ending. The story-line up until this point has been masterwork. Original screenplay and story-line has made you expect something a whole lot more from this tasteless ending. Perhaps the only problem made in this movie was that they tied it to Cloverfield (2008) as the clichés of every action thriller begin to appear. (Wont spoil anything). Everything went well until this point and I feel as though if they took a step in the opposite direction by exploring the roots of specific characters more and maybe even seeing the clover we all know and love from Cloverfield (2008) other than this bland, unoriginal excuse for an antagonist we see in this film.Don't get me wrong, this movie is full of twists and surprises that not all films get right. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) does get this right. Although a different ending should be apparent instead of a money grabbing ending setting the Cloverfield franchise up for future get-rich-quick type movies from this cult favorite movie. Just like other cult favorites, they have to be treated carefully and I found they did not for this film's ending.Thanks",8,5,9,20 March 2016
Cloverfield," A Surprisingly Satisfying Flick
","I went into this film expecting a low quality film reading reviews on its different camera work, but what I got out was a very satisfying movie that will make you want to watch it again out of curiosity.Much like Monsters (2010) and Super 8 (2011), the technique behind not being able to see the monster's appearance provides us with an engaging story that focuses more on the struggle to get out rather than the struggle to kill the 'monster'. The refreshing camera work brings us into the action alongside the protagonists and really helps us get to know the characters, making the struggle to get out, all the more real.Not just the camera work, but the visual effects and cinematic teams should be applauded for their original take on a Sci-Fi monster film. Although the cliché aspects of the film were there, the originality and experimental camera work shows us that this film may lead to more like it.",7,0,1,21 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Great Start to the Next Generation
","---SPOILERS Ahead---The seventh iteration of the Star Wars franchise has certainly been a hit with the box office and fans of the Sci-Fi cult. Although many are sitting on the fence, a lot agree this film has lived up to the hype. People don't agree to this entirely because the plot of The Force Awakens is eerily similar to ep 4, A New Hope. This being, the important droid everyone seeks, Han Solo disabling the shields, then rebels destroying a Death-Star-like object.JJ Abrams has opened the third generation with a cinematic experience every Star Wars fan has been looking for. Epic lightsaber fights, modern explosion effects and quality acting. The casting team has chosen a cast of high quality and will surely become the next faces of Hollywood. With the producer's very fine attention to detail - for instance, keeping the golden dice on the Millennium Falcon, hasn't gone unnoticed and the very fine editing with very few to no errors has satisfied most fan's expectations.After Lucasfilm's selling to Disney in 2012, Lucasfilm gave the rights to a popular and much loved franchise to the next generation in film makers. And JJ Abrams opened the third generation with a stunner.",8,3,19,21 December 2015
