Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Candid Camera meets Animal House
","Folks, there's nothing new here. For those of you too young to have seen it, a TV show called Candid Camera set up outrageous situations and recorded the reactions of unwitting dupes. In this movie, the dupes knew of the camera, but had been lied to about what it was there for; most were apparently told by the film makers that they were filming a documentary for a foreign audience.The (attempted) humor is the usual post-Animal House bathroom humor/gross-out humor/sophomoric humor. We are treated to the public's reaction as our heroes urinate/defecate/masturbate in plain view, skewer America's national anthem at a rodeo, disrupt a local TV news broadcast, ad nauseam.The punctuation of dignity is a comic staple dating back to before the Keystone Kops, or the 3 Stooges turning a white-tie gala into a pie fight. Herein, our hero Borat disrupts a formal dinner party, excusing himself to go to the restroom and returning to the table with his (alleged) feces in a sack.As with Candid Camera, what few laughs that may be got from this movie are, indeed, from the reactions to Borat by John Q. Public. When the comics are left to themselves and perform a slapstick fight in the nude, the movie literally isn't even watchable.",3,2,5,14 December 2006
Wanted," An action flick for the Xbox generation.
","Which means this is really bad movie. For those who want a break from the Xbox, here's a movie to veg-out in front of . . . a movie with just as much insight, character development, maturity, plausibility and intelligence as a video game, and with similar graphics.The movie tries to stand somewhere between fantasy and reality, with characters jumping through plate glass windows onto the roofs of skyscrapers across the street, and the like. Our hero's girlfriend is screwing his best friend, as the ATM machine reminds him. All this without having to fuss with a joystick. None of it works for a minute.This is an action film from the age of the 15-second sound byte, the epoch of no discernible attention span. I recommend watching Bullitt, The French Connection, 48 Hrs., or virtually anything else instead.",2,1,3,23 December 2008
