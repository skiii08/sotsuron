Requiem for a Dream," This film disturbed me
",This film depressed me- so much so that I actually cried afterwards! While the acting is superb (especially by Ellen Burstyn) seeing these people's dreams die really affected me.  The direction and camera-work only added to the disturbing feel of the film- it was painful to watch.  I would only recommend this film if you have a very thick skin.,6,0,0,4 September 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Great Movie- Exceeds Expectations
","I actually went to see this movie twice- and for ten dollars per ticket (ah, gotta love New York) this means something.I was initially dragged to this movie by my younger sister with very low expectations, considering it was Disney-made live action, a PG-13, and the previews weren't that great.I was very pleasantly surprised to say the least.  This movie put me in the mind of 'Indiana Jones'- a great action movie with some comedy thrown in- and ultimately very entertaining.  Unlike most action movies today made mostly for the teen-to-20's male crowd who will spend on video games, etc. this movie wasn't just an endless repetition of big guns, explosions and breasts.  Sure, all three of those made it in there (and some of the battle scenes are a bit long), but they didn't dominate- they were part of the fabric of the story and atmosphere.Both times I saw it, all but three of the jokes got laughs from everyone in the audience (and the sight gag that introduced Capt. Jack Sparrow was great).Two words: Johnny Depp.  Not only is he unbelievably sexy (eyeliner and all - sorry :) )  but his character is amazing- funny, well-acted, and really the moving force behind this movie.I enjoyed the other actors' performances as well (though Kiera Knightley seemed to be struggling to stay on par a bit- but I do give her credit for the physicality and comedy required).  Orlando Bloom, although required by the script to make a few cheesy faces and declarations, does a good job as the classic man out to save his love (and even has the look of a classic movie star).The only detractors were the over-the-top cheesiness of the romance and the attention paid to the Black Pearl pirates (or perhaps that attention would be ok if they were more pirate-like and a bit less hammy?)Overall, I thought this was a refreshingly good movie- something that has been missing from summers for quite a while.  Can best be summed up in one word: 'Entertaining!'  Go see it!",10,0,1,15 July 2003
Elf," Delightful
","Elf is a thoroughly delightful holiday movie!  I expected it to be funny (thanks to Will Ferrell), but I didn't expect it to be so cute or heartwarming.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Elf delivers the Christmas spirit without too much syrup (figuratively that is, since actual syrup appears quite often in the movie!), and is directed by Jon Favreau in the style of the best holiday films (including adorable sets at the North Pole and the appearance of traditional stop-motion Christmas characters).Will Ferrell stars as Buddy, a naive and joyful (not to mention sugar-hyper) human adopted by one of Santa's helpers at a young age (many jokes are gleaned from his 6'4' stature among the tiny elves).  At the age of 30, he heads to New York City to find his real father (played by James Caan), who appears, to Buddy's shock, on 'the naughty list.'  Hilarity ensues as Buddy adjusts to life in the big city, and everyone else in the cast adjusts to Buddy.Ferrell does an amazing job portraying Buddy.  Although Buddy is almost constantly hyperactive and could quickly wear on your patience, Ferrell imbues him with a childlike wonder and innocence combined with just the right dose of his usual crazy comic self.  The children and adults in the theater laughed at all the right places, and there was a collective silence at those parts that made your heart melt.The casting is inspired: James Caan, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart all play their roles straight and with conviction, while Zooey Deschanel shines (though she may possibly be too young to play opposite Ferrell?).  Cameos from a couple of offbeat comedians just sweetened the deal.I think this film could become another holiday classic, in the tradition of 'A Christmas Story' (though it's not quite as universal to the human experience as that marvelous film).  All I know is that I walked out the theater full of the Christmas spirit and itching to see Elf again!",8,0,0,10 November 2003
