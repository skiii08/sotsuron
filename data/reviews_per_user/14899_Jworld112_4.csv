50 First Dates," A great movie.
","If you are going into this movie looking for something completely silly like Billy Madison, you're going to the wrong movie.  While there were many comedic moments, it was a very serious movie, and a very touching love story.  Great performances by Sander, Barrymore, Schneider, Astin, Clark, and the rest of the cast.  Very fresh and different, very well written.  I would recommend that everyone see this movie at some point.  Definitely a great movie for a date.",8,0,0,21 February 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Entertaining and Original.
","While at times disturbing, 'The Butterfly Effect' is the type of movie that you want to talk about after leaving the theater.  Every time I see Ashton Kutcher's face, I picture him recanting lines from the classic 'Dude, Where's My Car?', but after 5 or 10 minutes into the movie, it was easy to accept him in a serious role.  Not a lot can be said without spoiling anything, so if you haven't seen it, catch this one before it leaves theaters.  It might lose some of its effect when off the big screen.",8,0,1,21 February 2004
Million Dollar Baby," Not Worth Watching Twice
","I can think of no way to better summarize this movie other than 'Not worth watching twice', accept maybe 'not worth watching once'.*Spoiler alert* Perhaps the most memorable thing from this movie (other than Morgan Freeman's outstanding performance- the only reason for the 'twice' in the summary) Is the fact that the main character is paralyzed for the last 40 minutes of a movie that is barely over 2 hours in length (sans the credits). With a third of the movie left, I felt that Swank's character would most definitely recover, but no, the inactivity lasted for a full 40 min until the boredom made it feel as if I myself was the one stuck paralyzed in a hospital bed.A typical outstanding performance by Freeman, a mediocre one by Eastwood, and a sappy performance by Swank which I found to be quite lacking, makes up the majority of the cast of what is surely the worst 'Best Picture' yet.",3,1,3,18 July 2005
Die Hard," One of the best movies I've seen!
","Non-stop action.  Unlike some other action movies, there are no boring parts to 'wait through' when watching it over and over and over again.  Bruce Willis is at his best in a well-written slice of pure excitement.  A must have for every collection of Guy Movies.",10,2,3,31 December 2003
