Kill Bill: Vol. 2," One of the best movies of 2004.
","KILL BILL: VOLUME 2 is one of the best movies of 2004 and is Uma Thurman's most improved performance since Batman and Robin. After assassinating two of her Ex colleges, Female Assassin The Bride sets out to assassinate her two other former colleges and kill her Ex Boss Bill who is holding her daughter in his custody. I love KILL BILL: VOLUME 2. Uma did good acting especially, she did well-acting at the end of the film when she crying in the bathroom, i thought it was a shame that Uma didn't get a Oscar for her performance. What was good about VOL. 2, was it had all the answers. David Carradine was born to play Bill. The music by Quentin Tarrantino's best-friend Robert Rodriguez was good. I thought the song 'About her' by Malcolm McClaren had good music and good lyrics, the song was about the relationship between The Bride and B.B. The fight between Elle and The Bride was a whoop-a** showdown and Elle got what she deserved. I thought the opening sequence when Uma is talking to the audience 'When i arrive at my destination. I'm gonna Kill Bill' is one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. This is a highly-recommended film for fans of Quentin Tarrantion, Uma Thurman and David Carradine. Watch out for cameos from Sid Haig and Samuel L. Jackson. Put on you're DVD, sit back and brace yourselves as Uma Thurman is going to kill Bill.",10,2,4,7 August 2005
