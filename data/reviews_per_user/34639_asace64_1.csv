Casablanca," Best of all
","Casablanca is the best movie of all time for me. Humphrey Bogart is my preferred actor and i think this is his best performance. Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains and Paul Henreid are also excellent here. Fantastic story and wonderful music. 'As time goes by' will always remain a classic and the scene with Sam and Rick where Rick says 'You played it for her, you can play it for me. Play it, Sam' is among the best movie lines ever. But my preferred line is when the movie gets to the end, 'Louie, i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'. Another unforgettable lines are 'We will always have Paris' and 'Roun up the usual suspects'. Wonderful. I have it on both versions, original and colorized, my advice if you never watched this one is to go and buy it. Amazing movie.",10,1,3,7 June 2006
