Marie Antoinette," severely disappointed
","From the preview this movie looks unique and appealing. However I saw this movie yesterday,and it was pretty much a dull film with very little plot. Along the lines of it being accurate to her life I pretty much didn't expect it to be very accurate as it is based off of the Royal Diary books put out. But this movie was very dull and totally low on the character development! It seemed like they were trying and failing miserably at fitting all of Marie Antionettes life into a period of a couple hours. The movie has tons of scenes with music and the camera zooming in on Dunst in various positions. Here is Dunst sitting on her bed... Here she is looking out the carriage.... Here she is standing there... I mean come on! Dunst is a good actress! But Copalla does not give her enough words, enough depth and enough time to develop in the movie! The music was odd because it frequently switched from classical 1700's music to our generation music leaving the scenes a bit miffed up. The only thing impressive to me was the costumes and elegance that surrounding dunst in this. But what is a movie without a lot of dialog or characters? Count Ferson in this movie must say as few as 2 sentences in this and makes Antionette seem silly to like him as it doesn't express his freverent loyalty and love he held for her. Certainly not worth the 15 dollars I spent to see it, even as a huge Antionette fan!",2,4,7,21 October 2006
