War Dogs," A slightly underrated film
","This is not an 8/10 film, but it's not 7/10 either. I'd give it 7.6 and rounding up to the nearest whole number.Great casting and acting. The acting could've been a little better, but I think the point was to make this film more light-hearted and less of a deep drama. I'm conflicted about that choice.The film has a good amount of a relationship drama, the friendship between the two entrepreneurs, a cross-border smuggling action scene, enough jokes to cut the tension, which made this film more mainstream and easier to watch for most people. Perhaps a gritty, dark film about weapons and war would've been too intense for many and would've polarized people into loving or hating this film, rather than having most people liking it.My wine-like 'goes with' recommendation: I recommend the show The Night Manager to go with this film.",8,0,0,24 January 2017
Pawn Sacrifice," A disjointed, mildly entertaining film filled with historical/biographical inaccuracies
","This is the ultimate problem of historical or biographical films. Films exist on a scale, realistic on one end and Hollywood on the other. Most based on a true story films try to be in the middle. This one went too far the Hollywood side. Notice I didn't say 'entertaining' - films can be completely realistic and entertaining and completely unrealistic and still be boring.The real Fischer is so interesting, so there was no need to reinvent a new person to tell the story. Fischer had a father figure who was in his life, he just didn't know it was his actual father. Fischer was interested in languages and learned them to read chess periodicals and was not one to go around saying 'Speak American' to people. The film has Fischer choosing to lose his virginity to a prostitute, picking the person, time and place. He's completely in control. Even though in this same film he can barely control his emotions. In real life he met a girl during the tournament and he got 'caught up in women and sex' to the point where it cost him the tournament, the only tournament failure in his career. Isn't that interesting enough to make a film out of it? Why change the story for change's sake?Anyway, other than random script issues, which later become editing issues, the story is the weakest part of this film.The rest is top notch. Production quality is high. Liev Schreiber, bravo, bravo, sir, on your Russian.The film, overall, is a highly polished, professionally produced mediocre picture. There is no reason to see it again and it's difficult to recommend to anyone but serious chess or Fischer fans.",6,3,6,18 January 2017
Inception," Great idea, great execution
","Almost everything has been said about this film, even though it's slightly polarizing. People that like it love it, but there are many that can't stand this film or its popularity.This is my review after watching it the second time, the first being in the theater, the second on Blu-ray.This is almost a perfect film so I will only talk about the things I didn't like.The action scenes are too long. The snow scene at the end (The one from N64 Goldeneye) was way too long and pointless. The best parts of this film are the idea-based ones - 'let's implant an idea in his head' 'let's use his father as bait' etc. Instead, we get a lot of 'let's have a car chase scene in this city' 'let's have a chase in a crowded African bazaar,' 'let's have a shootout in the snow.'This may be my favorite blockbuster film of all time, but the action goes a little bit on the side of excess.9/10",9,0,3,31 January 2017
Her," Ted Mosby get a computer girlfriend
","I'm surprised by the insane amount of praise this film gets, but then I remembered that I strongly disliked this film but didn't bother giving it a review. If folks that didn't like this film don't review it then it looks like everyone agrees that this film is perfect, which it isn't.The main character is a version of Theodore Evelyn Mosby from How I Met Your Mother, although here he's called Theodore Twombly. You know the deal He's just a sensitive guy, living in the big city looking for the right one, but no one gets him. He wants Mrs. Perfect, but perfection doesn't exist. So instead of being less intolerant of people's imperfections, Ted wants out. Mosby keeps going from woman to woman saying 'she's not the one,' but Twombly decides to date a computer instead. The personality is completely unlikable and the film attempts to make you empathize with someone who is intolerant of others and intolerable himself.The AI is the perfect woman for Ted, she gives him exactly what he wants while asking for nothing. She has no flaws whatsoever and exists only to make Ted feel better. There's nothing wrong with that, don't get me wrong, but the film doesn't let Ted look in the mirror and look into his own soul and mind - how did he become like this? How did he become someone who simply cannot tolerate living with anyone? We are social beings by nature. We would not have reached a population of billions and developed all these things like microprocessors, software, speech recognition and artificial intelligence if we were not social.But this film doesn't explore these issues. Is Ted's asocial/anti-social behavior the result of a society that has become too consumerist and materialistic for him? Did society lose its soul? Did big corporations kill the concept of society and replace it with consumers?Did we replace the social experience of a concert with Spotify? Did we replace the art gallery with an iPad? Did Youtube kill the cooking/tango class? Maybe, but the film never says it.So we're not really sure if Ted wants out of this particular society or if he wants out of any society because the film never comments on these issues. We don't know if the world sucks and Ted finds solace in AI or if the world is a wonderful place that Ted rejects for AI.The film shows that many people are in love with their phones, but how did things get this way? Why are things this way? Is there anyone trying to change things? Is Ted a victim of this society or the worst culprit?The film ignores all these issues and makes it a fluff piece. It is a pretty commercial for a fluffy, pastel-colored, soft-filtered commercial for an ideal world in which this love story happens. The film is neither critical of Ted nor of the world that makes him fall in love with a computer. We are supposed to marvel at technology and at paying a big corporation a monthly subscription for love, something that is supposed to be free.It is a dystopia where people can't stand each other, corporations run the world, everyone is dressed the same, megacorp monopolies run the show (everyone has the same phone, everyone has the same operating system, there are no rival products), and people tell their deepest secrets to always-listening machines protected/sponsored(run?) by the state in the name of love, as long as you pay your monthly bill.",2,4,6,27 January 2017
