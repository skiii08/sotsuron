Mission: Impossible III," Mission Impossible 3
","Ethan Hunt is back in another amazing thriller, non stop attack makes this movie a must see. This was the defiantly the best movie I've seen all year. Great action sequences, great plot, great everything. And by far the best Mission Impossible.Not a huge Tom Cruise fan but after seeing this movie I really respect him. The actress that plays his girlfriend isn't too bad either. Plus Philip Seymour Hoffman is a really good bad guy, I don't want to mess with him.Final words, Absolutely fantastic. Go see it, it's worth it.",10,0,1,5 May 2006
