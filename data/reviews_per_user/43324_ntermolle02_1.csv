Iron Man 3," The story of Tony Stark a.k.a Iron Man
","In this third movie of Iron Man, Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., is confronted with another random guy trying to avenge himself from the past mistake that Tony made. But this time, Tony is also confronted with his inner-self after the battle of New-York (the one you can see in Avengers). This might be the best of the three movies because in this one, you can see a Tony Stark in a weak position and not in the strong and self-confident way you are used to see him. Although some useless scene or some incomprehension about some character, the movie keep you in suspense the entire time. The movie has a interesting twist that you certainly don't expect. In the end, the movie is good but not the best superhero movie that I have ever seen.",7,0,1,22 October 2013
