The Blair Witch Project," Don't go see the movie unless you want to spoil your money!
","I went to see the film with four of my friends and all five of us got out of the movie theater saying: 'Was it supposed to be scary?' Because it was not! It ain't scary one minute... The ending is almost obvious and ain't as everyone says, a moment that I will never forget!I was very disappointed, and I don't want you to be as well! So don't go see this movie!",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
