Mission: Impossible III," This is yet another typical blockbuster action film.
","This is yet another typical blockbuster action film. If you are looking for a movie with an original plot, stay far away from this movie. Even before the movie was half way through I could tell what the ending would be. That's just how predictable it was. In the entire movie, only one 'good guy'gets killed. It is extremely unlikely that someone could jump unto buildings from high altitudes, and survive multiple gunfights without receiving a single bullet wound or severe injuries. The movie also appeared to take place in our time period, yet there were several high tech devices that couldn't have possibly have been real. Such as the device that made a realistic mask of a persons face in only minutes. One of the main reasons people watched this movie was because of Tom Cruise. In every big action movie, they have to put at least one well known star, so that people will watch the movie.",6,0,0,6 November 2006
