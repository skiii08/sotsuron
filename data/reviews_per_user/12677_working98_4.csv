Casablanca," So, that's it, huh?
","Certain movies gain a status whereby their name becomes an invocation. Star Wars, Psycho, Citizen Kane, Jaws, Titanic and certainly Casablanca qualify as movies that virtually anyone can get a freeze frame in their mind. They can name the key actors, recite dialogue, and even give an overview of the plot without necessarily even having seen the film in person.The legend of Casablanca exceeds most films ever produced.  The film is held in a near religious regard which is normally reserved for fans of genre films.  (Witness the slavish devotion to the Star Wars product line despite the increasing evidence that the creator of these films has lost not only touch with reality, but even a rememberance of what made the first film so compelling.)  And having finally seen Casablanca for myself I am left unsetteled at how unimpressed I was by this classic of modern cinema.
The setting for the story is unique enough.  Nazi controlled North Africa is not a familiar device for gushy romances.  But a city does not a movie make. The story itself isn't terribly deep.  Old lovers reunited.  Unfinished business must remain that way.  They part unfulfilled.  And the characters are not written in such a way as to give them depth and persona beyond their plot-driven dialogue.  Cinematography is to my untrained eye, dull and unremarkable.  O.K. the sets are nicely done.But the greatest deficiency of them all is the performance given by the leading man.  Humphrey Bogart is a legend among tough guy actors.  Why was he cast in the role of an introspective gentleman entrepeneur?  While even uttering these thoughts has in past and undoubtedly will again make me the target of jihad by the most bloodthirsty classic movie fans, I must say I've seen better performances on Murder, She Wrote.  Honestly.In fact I would go so far as to say that people in need of an object lesson in miscasting and insufficient artistic depth would do well to take notes on Bogey's performance here.I would be remiss if I did not interject here the beatific Ingrid Berman and the scene stealing Claude Rains.  These two people are about the only enjoyable part of the entire process and keep the film from being a shambles.The saving grace that I repeatedly hear offered up in defense of this film is that it is old.  I find this utterly insufficient.  Noting that a film was made prior to 1970 seems to excuse all manner of technical and story related problems.  Everyone wants to put it into the context of how bad every other movie was back then.  Now perhaps if I had not seen more modern dramas, I would be thrilled with this movie, but using the same measuring stick by which I judge any new film, this one comes up terrible short.",Null,0,2,21 January 2004
Troy," Talking in theatres
","Big stuff, The Illiad.  Trying to sandwich all that into three movies would have been quite a job, and it would have probably muddled the idea before it was through.  Selecting a heavy important slice of what the Illiad is about and building a film -around- that idea worked pretty darn well.In the age of Digital crowd scenes and computerized destruction, we have come to simply expect huge, big, large and enormous.  And Troy has all of these.  Extra heapings of each, actually.  And yeah, it's lost its surprise but if you hadn't seen half a zillion spear wielding farmers advancing on the walls of Troy there's no doubt you'd miss it.  O.K. so visually the story has lots of armies and fighting.  Got it.What else?  Well, if you ask Jerry Bruckheimer, there's not much else needed except good looking people being given excuses for kissing each other.  The final product of this here film however is why Bruckheimer's head should be placed on a a pike on Sunset blvd. as a warning to Roland Emmerich.  The relationships shown between the various characters here are proof that action films can indeed have substance and story and humanity. 
Eric Bana is particularly terrific as the level-headed hero, Hector.  Brad Pitt IS a god as Achilles.  Rose Byrne's Briseis was particularly engaging. Brian Cox's Agamemnon is a highly watchable king S.O.B. but without being a caricature.  Orlando Bloom on the other hand is a trifle ham-fisted.  His face is pretty expressionless.  Bummer there, Legolas.Don't let the big budget prejudice you.  This is a good movie and it's very well done.  Filling in the slots between the battles with these character's relationships was not only necessary it was executed with aplomb.  Seriously happy I saw this.  Now to see about that pike on Sunset Boulevard...",8,0,1,1 June 2004
"I, Robot"," Surprised
","So, it's a big budget action film and all. It's not Gosford Park but then it's closer to that than other sci-fi treasures-become-film like Battlefield Earth.I don't think it's fair to review this movie without making note of the outrage expressed by the sci-fi fan base over the plot of this film. Apparently the film is pretty substantially different from the book. Having a beloved book taken from you and turned into a different movie is disappointing and usually a disaster.Now, to one who doesn't know the book: This is a good movie. It takes a number of ideas such as reliance on technology, racial prejudice, survivor's guilt and the nature of the soul and frames them in a high-tech big budget actioner. That's a good thing.There were a couple of scenes that I think show the problem of making this kind of movie in Hollywood. The big robots-jumping-on-the-Audi scene that made all the trailers and advertisements didn't need to be done so lavishly. It reminded me of the Death Star battle in Jedi where swarms of ships appear on screen at once. It was too much for me to appreciate visually. It may be though that without the combination of forces at work this wouldn't have been as good as it turned out to be. Not terrific. I'm not saying that, but it's a good film.Of note: Will Smith's acting in this is pretty damn good. His character's tend to be extensions of Fresh Prince. They're highly exuberant and cocky. This time, he's subdued and a bit more cynical. It's a nice change. Let's see... There's the presence of James Cromwell, which helps any film. And here's something: I noticed that many of the characters in the film are black. I appreciated seeing this since these characters are not by necessity black characters, they're just people and these are black. That kind of racial mix made sense to me and I feel it needs to be done a lot more often.Anyway, it's not dull, it's not silly and it's got something to say. I think you might give it a try.",8,0,1,24 December 2004
The Incredibles," Digital becomes relevant
","Pixar has already shown a propensity to place story and humor over digital gimmickry, but this time they've managed to find a tremendous balance between the two with The Incredibles.Brad Bird's story about a family rediscovering itself is well executed if not unpredictable, but the humanity of the characters is unmistakable. Perhaps more scene-stealing however is the subtlety of movement in the character's acting. Clearly the animators have been doing lots of people watching because these people move and gesture in such small and true ways its almost thrilling to watch.Digital movie making is pretty hit and miss. Basically Pixar hits and everyone else misses but this time they've really done themselves proud. Brad Bird's collaboration with Pixar produces a document of film-making excellence. Would that other animators could find the soul and depth of a Pixar movie, never mind the comedy. Finding Nemo and now this. Digital acting took a colossal step forward with Andy Serkis' performance in the Lord of the Rings. In that one, the animators took Serkis out and left his intent on screen. This time, the propeller-heads have actually created actors where there were none to begin with and they did a better job than half of Hollywood's a-list. I want more!",9,0,1,15 November 2004
