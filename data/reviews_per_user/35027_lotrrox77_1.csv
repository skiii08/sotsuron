Mission: Impossible III," Theme Song
","I for one gave the movie a 10/10, in most part to outweigh the voters who are just bashing the movie because they dislike Tom Cruise. I do not agree with him in many respects, but found the film amazing.But back to my topic. I'm not going to bore you with a play-by-play of the film as most other reviewers are, but instead touch on something a bit different: the theme song.I was a bit disappointed in its lack of presentation, (there were some points of the film where it was severely lacking and could have been used perfectly) but I adored the use of drums to beat out the theme. It was an excellent spin on a well-worn sound that deserves to be on par with the themes from films like Indiana Jones and Star Wars (spawned from the mind of the great composer John Williams). I was just wondering if anyone else noticed the drum take on the theme instead of the familiar version. Liked it or loved it? Let me know.<3",10,0,1,7 May 2006
