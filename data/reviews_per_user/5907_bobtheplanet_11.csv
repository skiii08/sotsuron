Alien 3," Sucked!
","That sums it up - the most disappointing sequel I have ever seen. A remake of the first film with moronic skin-headed gits running around. Tie some wet towels on their heads and call it 'Monty Python's Alien Buggery Ball'. They're just movies, but they should be CONSISTENT AND ENTERTAINING!Shambling direction, despair, wobbly acting, despair, black holes in the plot, despair, too many low camera angles (what... is Fincher an upskirt voyeur?), despair, creature effects that remind me of a squirrel chasing it's nuts around, more despair... What was the point of making this POS?",1,492,530,4 May 2006
Minority Report," Typical Spielberg SciFi Nonsense
","More lame pseudo-science fiction from Spielberg - the second in his Trilogy of Turds; 'A.I.', 'Minority Report', and 'War of the Worlds'. Glossy, but unsatisfying pap from his 'Dark Disney' period of the 21st century.I only watched this to see Max von Sydow, but since his role was so small he should have just phoned it in. They should have dumped Cruise and given Max the lead. An excuse for a chase movie with jet-packs and rolling eyes. This stuff is getting old already. None of it makes sense, and, of course, Sherlock Cruise has to explain everything at the end! Duh. Retire already.",1,13,25,3 July 2007
Gravity," Eeny, Meeny, Miny, NO!
","I anticipated watching a good space movie for a change until I saw who wrote and directed it - Alfonso Cuaron. I knew then I should lower my expectations considerably. Somewhere below Carpenter's 'Ghosts of Mars'.It's all about internal consistency. This movie makes no claim to being science fiction, it purports to be a realistic scenario, yet it violates physical laws and disregards current facts at will. The Law of Inertia only seems to apply to the minds of the writers and director. This spinning junkpile is really a fancy vehicle for Alfonso Cuaron to make a not-so-subtle philosophical statement against science (that is, assuming he wasn't just trying to make another roller-coaster video game movie like 'Children of Men').Everything in the movie points to science as being dangerous and incomprehensible to commoners like Sandra Bullock (even her protective suit eventually turns against her and tries to drown her), and that we are better off wandering through the forests in our underwear (or preferably naked... but I doubt if Sandra would agree to that). In Cuaron's world all these Machines are out to kill people. Science Bad! Cuaron Smash!Yes, it's the inconsistencies that make movies look bad. But the investors will be happy, most of the critics and movie-going public do not have enough practical scientific knowledge or critical thinking skills to know that 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe' is not the correct module separation and landing sequence in Chinese space station escape pods.",1,114,201,25 October 2013
Unbreakable," Unbelievable... in the truest sense of the word.
","Man finds out that he is a 'real' superhero because his self-proclaimed arch-Nemesis says so. They punch their time-cards and slowly start circling each other.Zombie-like Bruce Willis plods through almost 2 hours of a 25 minute 'Twilight Zone' script. Style and atmosphere without any punch to it. The theme appears to be that some people don't know their own strength, and other people's reach exceeds their grasp. Shyamalan's autobiography? One-hit Wonder writer/director takes the first step onto the wooden plank that will drown his career. Unbelievable and pretentious.",2,0,2,23 January 2007
Interstellar," Inter... STELLA!
","I only give this movie 3 stars because, like many others, I believe it will balance out the mindlessly effusive reviews that IMDb seems to generate for highly-anticipated movies. I must say, however, that I would honestly give this movie about a 5 or 6 and no more. The main problem I see with it is typical of many modern movies - poor screen writing. Doesn't anyone read this stuff between the final draft and filming? At 2 hours and 45 minutes I did not think it was overlong. I wasn't bored so much as flummoxed. I actually believe there is a magical extra 15 minutes somewhere that might steer this titanic disaster away from the critical icebergs that may doom it.Down to particulars:Too Much Damn Corn! (In more ways than one)The future in this movie actually does not look too bad. There's plenty of beer, pickup trucks, and no okra (yay!). So what is the beef? There really is no convincing reason to leave Earth because of some piffle about environment degradation. The effort involved to create artificial environments in space would seem to me to be exponentially more time consuming and expensive than the same effort on good old terra firma. The whole ecosystem collapse story is unnecessary. Why have we gone into, and continue to go into, Outer Space even though wars, famine, and pestilence beset us continually? Nolan should have bit the bullet and gone for the real answer instead of making up a fairy tale - that is, our innate curiosity and desire for knowledge will drive us to the limits of the Universe and beyond. We don't need hokey dust storms and blights (Say, how did those spacelings solve the food blight problem in their massive cylinders - and why position them out by Saturn? Why didn't they just go underground instead of into space? ) And the seriousness of the situation on Earth just wasn't conveyed well except during the massive dust storm. Another odd thing never explained - no dogs, no cats, no chickens, pigs, or cows... not even a crow or a rat to be seen. Where are the animals? Where are the insects? Some of the 15 min. could have been used to clarify these points, but better yet... chuck the whole first hour.Too Much Damn Noise!Some people may like Hans Zimmer's work, but I don't see him as the next Jerry Goldsmith or Bernard Herrmann. It was like listening to Philip Glass at 110 db and certainly did not sound as spacey as Vangelis' work for Blade Runner. Especially annoying when it covered up important dialog in the dramatic moments, but that may be due to sound mixing. Overall, I rate him as flat and innocuous at best. And speaking of dialog, was MC channeling Marlon Brando for his role? Some of his dialog was barely comprehensible. For a movie heavy with exposition that is a bit unacceptable.Too Many Damn Holes!Speaking of exposition: how the hell did MC learn to fly those new-fangled space machines so fast (everyone else had simulator classes); How did they get all that junk into space to build their starship with no one on Earth noticing dozens of Saturn V rockets blasting into the sky? Why didn't MC just say 'Murph' instead of 'Stay', he already knew he would leave, because HE ALREADY KNEW HE WOULD LEAVE GRAVITY TRACES TO COMMUNICATE AND SOLVE THE EQUATION! When they surfed down the wave why didn't the ship crash into the surface of Miller since it was only covered with 12 inches of water most of the time? They never did get it straight about the 5-D beings - are they us, or something else? Why? Why? Why? Too many unanswered questions glossed over amid all the physics mumbo-jumbo in this convoluted mess.I'm sorry, it was a dud, nothing stellar about it.",3,5,8,17 August 2015
District 9," Wackiest 'Fooking' Comedy of the Year
","I cannot believe that anyone is taking this movie seriously as some great scifi masterpiece or a philosophical indictment of apartheid. It's a fookin' joke, man. Cockroach-like aliens that love cat food (cans and all!), can't find the door out of their fookin' spaceship for 3 months, can turn humans into tomato soup with lightning bolt bioweapons yet live in a slum garbage heap. It's all fookin' hilarious! I haven't laughed so hard since Mike and the Bots left the airwaves. Sharlto Copley must be the Peter Sellers of S.A. His whole performance seemed like an Inspector Closeau parody. He's the new fookin' Jerry Lewis.",1,2,8,29 December 2009
The Mist," I must have 'Mist' something here...
","Imagine you are stuck in the only American small town general store that does not sell firearms and ammo, and it is filled with the cast of a Canadian produced Sci-Fi channel B-movie on their lunch break. That's about all there is to this movie. Oh, except for the tagged on 'Oh, crap! what have I done!' ending.Typically, for most modern horror/science-fiction films, there is no imagination involved in this production. Tension between the clich√©d characters is noticeably forced, the strategic choices made by this group of dunderheads would have a group of baboons howling with laughter, and you could find better monsters in the pages of old comic books like 'Tales to Astonish'. Come on, toothed tentacles, big hornets, pterodactyloids, spiders ( ...not spiders again, my god ), and a giant, long-legged, tentacled cow-something that walks around mooing like a foghorn. Why don't these guys try something new... like giant comb jellies or flying toasters.At least the Sci-Fi channel has silly titles like 'Mansquito' that are clear cues to lower your expectations and/or stock up on beer. I don't understand how this cornball stuff gets taken any more seriously than the film fodder used on MST3K. And, 'No', it's not about the psychology of crowds - it's about marketing to clods.",3,10,21,11 April 2008
Children of Men," Lowest Common Denominator
","Hair-thin plot line - kids nowadays are multitaskers, forget that linear single-threaded structuring. Half our audience can't think anyway! In vitro fertilization? Cloning? What happened? Or is this a really bad case of Brewer's droop in the UK (cut off the Guiness supply maybe?)Mindless violence - hey,... it's real! Or as real as our mind wants it to be. Why does anyone do anything in this film? What the Hell are they fighting for? Political posturing - give them slogans, Incite, not Insight. ...and a little button-eyed girl walks out at the end and belts out, 'Tomorrow...Tomorrow... 'Eye Candy with patented 'HIP' sugar-coating applied. Buy the new 'Dystopia' snack bar (available at the concession stand).If this review makes no sense to you, then you have just experienced 'Children of Men'.",1,21,37,3 July 2007
Avatar," Dances with Pterodactyls, or, I'll Have a Blue Quetzalcoatlus Without You.
","Have IQ's dropped sharply while I was gone? The overwhelming special effects of Avatar simply cannot hide the vacuousness of its story. As just about anyone who can read has noticed, the plot is a rehash of the 'civilised man goes native' fable popularized from 'Last of the Mohicans' to the present day (I'm sure even the ancient Egyptians have a version preserved in hieroglyphs somewhere on a dusty temple wall). The CGI is realistic enough that you can become engaged with the digital characters... except, then your attention is focused on the story. Which is almost as lame as a 6th graders summer vacation essay.I did not see the movie in 3D as I assumed it would be pointlessly distracting. I have seen polarized 3D movies before. Starting with one of the first, 'The Bubble' in the late 60's. The peak of this in-your-face technology was reached years ago in the 70's with the release of 'The Stewardesses'. Nothing in this movie can compete with real 3D boobs.",3,13,20,3 February 2010
War of the Worlds," Spielberg Screws Us Again
","After the crap that was 'A.I.', Spielberg takes another dump on the film-going audience with another SciFi extravaganza made up of annoying, unsympathetic characters; disjointed, pot-holed plot line; and a sappy ending that sucks the life out of this picture much as the aliens do of their hapless human victims. I must admit... some of the effects looked good... and that my dislike of this film is intensely fueled by my loathing of Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, and the other kid (I was rooting for the aliens). But it was in the discount bin and completed my collection of all 4 of the War of the Worlds films - of which only the George Pal version is worthy of more than one viewing!",1,6,13,3 July 2007
Signs," Sign of the Times
","Preacher loses his faith in God, gets it back by whacking an Alien.What is wrong with this picture? There it is... poor craftsmanship due to Superfluous Novelty. Shyamalan's 'style' seems to just that... all style, no substance. Maybe he is trying to use the William Burroughs method of 'cut-up' storytelling - you write something - chop it into snippets - and then reassemble it randomly. I believe that Anime is written this way. Put a lot of unrelated ideas on little slips of paper, mix them in a bowl, and then pull out a few to create characters and plot. Like: Samurai/Robot/Bus driver - good protagonist! Amphibious/Demon/Wombats - what a villain! Moon Landing/Nuclear/Earthquake - sets the stage! All this makes you SEEM to be creative and innovative. But it all falls flat without some thread of continuity to it. Some people can do it (i.e., 'The Birds') and others can't (i.e., 'Signs').This movie tries to do 2 things simultaneously and succeeds at neither. As a morality fable of 'lost faith', it's main character is not believable to me - he's just a plot device. As some sort of Science Fiction 'thriller', it was not suspenseful and relied on pointless and overused 'boogeyman' thrills - I suppose it looks good in the trailers to get the crowds in. I liked 'The Sixth Sense' , it was OK. I watched 'Unbreakable' and found it pointlessly arbitrary and confusing; like a jigsaw puzzle made from several different boxes. I have not seen 'The Village' or 'Lady in the Water', but they both sound like a further deterioration in his film-making career.",1,2,4,23 January 2007
