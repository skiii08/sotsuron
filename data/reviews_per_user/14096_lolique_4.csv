Mission: Impossible III," The McGuffin is still alive and doing fine in the third version of Mission Impossible
","It's been a long time since the last Mission Impossible II film (2000), but No. III comes in with a gigantic bang. It has to be the best action flick of the year and a great film in any other sense. It keeps you on the edge of your seats all of the time and proves once and again that the Hitchcockian McGuffin is still as important nowadays as it was in Hitch's good days. Here it's referred to as a Rabbit's Foot. As all of us remember, the McGuffin is a device or plot element that catches the viewer's attention or drives the plot and is essentially something that the entire story is built around and yet has no real relevance. The action and the acting is so good that at the end nobody really cares about the Rabbit's Foot or McGuffin that caused all the fuss. Don't miss it if you like good action, modern cinematography, fast cutting, great chases and stunts done by none other than Tom Cruise himself.",9,10,22,28 April 2006
Apocalypse Now," Director's cut or director's nightmare?
","Let me first state that I consider 'Apocalypse Now' in my top 5 best films of all times and the botched, bloated Redux version will not change my opinion. When I first saw the film it was more than just a motion picture, it was a horrifying exploration into the Vietnam war and just like Coppola has stated that it 'was not a film about the Vietnam war, but the Vietnam war', the picture gripped me more than any before or any after. It is truly a film masterpiece in every respect. Unfortunately the new Redux version is something else. First of all, it incorporates three sequences (the Playboy bunnies in a stranded helicopter, the French plantation and its strange ghost-like characters and the ridiculous scene of Kurtz reading paragraphs from Time magazine to a tied-up Willard), which should have remained in their natural habitat: the cutting-room floor. The rest of the film is a strange mixture of scenes successfully extended to give more insight into the characters, or the excellent dissolve montage at the beginning with the ceiling fan, the stealing of Colonel Kilgore's surfing board, the expansion of Kurtz's dialogue near the end where he comes in and out of shadows, but gone is the tight and to the point editing that turned this river journey from a terrifying and gripping nightmare into a milk run or travelogue more suited for the Discovery or History Channels. They should have followed Willard's advice after the tiger incident: 'don't ever get off the boat again'. One scene in special comes to mind: the one where they open fire on the innocent Vietnamese on the boat that they meet in the river. In the original version this scene came at a moment that the tension in the film was so high that the gunner's reaction was totally motivated and came about as a release to the nervous tension that had everyone in the boat on the edge of insanity. In the new version the killing becomes just a senseless massacre without any motivation at all. And there are many other instances just like it, but hard to pin down from seeing this version only once. Also, the absence of the original ending is a big disappointment. Anyhow, it is sad to see that even with 22 years of hindsight, Coppola still doesn't have the necessary objectivity to manipulate his material again. A prettier, larger package doesn't necessarily make a better film.",10,3,3,5 October 2001
Van Helsing," Great on effects and photography, short on story
","This is probably one of the most beautifully shot FX films in a long time, capturing the dark moody atmosphere of the early German impressionistic films, using some of the best background mattes seen in a long time. Unfortunately the skimpy story-line doesn't hold up for the long running time and audiences will start to get bored way before the end title. Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious are perfect in their roles. Richard Roxburgh has a wonderful time chewing-up all the scenery available as the campy Count Vladislaus Dracula and David Wenham brings comedy-relief to the side-kick part of Carl. Even though the ending will come as a surprise (and a disappointment) for most general audiences, anyhow this visually handsome film should do GREAT business in the boxoffice.",7,1,2,29 April 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," I hate to be a party-pooper, but 'Matrix Reloaded' is a bore!
","It's very probable that I'm not in the right age category to review this film (the 10 to 30-35 age group), which is probably one of this year's most eagerly awaited films, but I found it even more of a bore than the first one. At least in the first one some of the special effects were ground-breaking, but they've been so over-used in the interim in other features and in commercials that this time around they seem old-hat. And since there's not too much of a story-line to interest viewers it becomes just a matter of waiting to go from one action scene to the other. And at that, one of the longest scenes in the film is a fight on top of one extremely loooong truck speeding full throttle along one of L.A.'s murderous freeways which seems to last hours instead of the normal minutes! It's a shame that Hollywood can't find something better to do with all of the millions of dollars that seem to float in its rarified air. Barely a 5 out of 10.",5,3,4,13 May 2003
