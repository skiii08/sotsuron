The Avengers," Go see it now.
","I saw the movie in 2D and loved it. The summer of 2012 begins with a BANG and the rest of the season movies 'have met their match'.Making the blockbuster 'The Avengers' into a masterpiece of entertainment, at the time it was announced, seemed impossible for me to achieve with such a high level of efficiency and art. Not even the news of Joss Whedon directing (which I'm familiar with since his 'Buffy' times'), not even the actors cast, not even the most recent trailers, could have prepared me for HOW WELL this movie is made. I already knew it was gonna be good, but I wasn't expecting it to be THIS GOOD!All the actors are at the top of their game. I won't stand out anyone, let's just say they're all excellent. From the main cast and even the secondary characters like agent Coulson or agent Hill. They're really good in this. And they all get their moments to shine, not only individually, but as a group. I didn't feel that one or the other got more 'screen time' than the others, or that one was more important than the rest (speaking about the super-heroes). Each had its own relevance, contributed to the group, and we can clearly feel that when the team finally bonds, 'they're tough as nails'. This is a rare feat when dealing with ensemble casts. I'm wondering if any other movie has achieved this level of balance with such a high caliber group of actors.The script and the dialogs between characters, between the Avengers or between each one and Loki, are also spot-on. It's more than obvious the Whedon touch, who creates a tapestry of living words that sometimes goes beyond the 'comic book' feel of the movie into something more (specifically the lines Loki delivers). And there's no shortage of humor: there are laugh out loud moments, funny moments that we weren't expecting, especially one very short scene between Thor and Hulk that takes but a blink of an eye. Oh, before I forget: if the trailers left you with a bitter taste of 'Transformers' in your mouth, make no mistake: the action isn't, and by far, as robotic, tedious and soulless like in those movies.Regarding the technical aspects, there's not much to tell here. ILM delivers as usual and almost like no other. The art direction, the sound effects, the costumes are great. Alan Silvestri's score is more than competent.In short, 'The Avengers' reaches without a problem the title of best movie of 2012 so far, and it will surely be in many top ten lists when the year is done. It is a landmark of cinema and in its particular genre that, although different from other movies of the same quality ('Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight'), will absolutely not go unseen by lots and LOTS of people (fans and non-fans), and that we will remember like a 'Hulk smash to the head': a 2h 20m punch that goes by so fast and that leaves me wanting much more. Joss Whedon had a gigantic task ahead of himself, and not only he delivers perfection, he may finally get the recognition he's been deserving for years: he's become the next great director not to miss. Welcome to the big league, Mr. Whedon! When will 'The Avengers 2' be coming out, sir?9/10 (which may well be a 9.5 or 10 after a second viewing)",10,1,4,4 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," My favorite movie of '05 so far
","SPOILERS!!!I've seen the movie only a while ago, and let me start by saying: This is, without a doubt, the best of the prequels and one the best of the entire 'Star Wars' saga. Until now, my favorite movie of 2005.'Revenge Of The Sith' begins with the regular opening, which we got so used to: 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...'. Then the yellow crawl that we all love. It makes me real sad to see it... being the last episode of 'Star Wars'.Lucas doesn't like beginnings, so he puts us right in the middle of the action, with Anakin and Obi-Wan flying their Jedi star-fighters between tens of star-ships in what is probably the largest space battle ever seen on the big screen. Their mission is to reach General Grievous's ship, in order to rescue Chanceler Palpatine, who was kidnapped by Count Dooku and by Grievous himself, a mix between robot and some sort of insect or reptile (??), one of the leaders of the separatists and probably the most deadly character of the entire movie, who can wield, at the same time, 'only' four light sabers.The action proceeds inside Grievous's ship and Palpatine's rescue contains the only (few) comedic moments of the movie, all thanks to R2-D2, who looks totally inspired. But early do we see that 'Revenge Of The Sith' is a much more darker movie than its predecessors. In fact, this was the only 'Star Wars' movie that was rated PG-13 in the USA (the equivalent to people with 12 or more here in Portugal). The weird thing is, in Portugal 'Revenge Of The Sith' was rated PG (or for people with 6 or more). The regulating entity that checks the cinematic content screwd up, I guess. This movie is without a doubt PG-13 (or 12, here), much more violent and with certain themes and images that a child shouldn't watch (just look at the state Anakin gets after the duel with Obi-Wan... is that something a young kid should see? I don't think so).It's pointless to say that in the rest of the story we learn how Anakin turns into Darth Vader. Nothing is left unanswered, not even the doubts left by Episodes I and II or the original trilogy. The fans will enjoy this movie immensely because it connects the prequels to the sequels, in a most excellent way. Several examples are: we find out (though not in a direct way) how Anakin is born, the motives that led him to turn to the dark side, the execution of the Jedi, why the robots don't recognize Darth Vader, the birth of the twins, Luke and Leia, the exile of Yoda and Obi-Wan, etc..'Revenge Of The Sith' has many light-sabre duels, more than any other 'Star Wars' episode. It's a real madness. They are really awesome and beautifully choreographed. I would like to especially point out the duel between Palpatine and Yoda, and Anakin vs. Obi-wan.The visual effects are even better than on the previous episodes (the only bad effect was Obi-Wan's lizard when chasing Grievous on Utapau). The movie was shot entirely on digital and on 'bluescreen', a technique used in other movies such as 'Sin City' or 'Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow', to mention a few. The number of CG shots is about 2,200, much more than the previous two episodes combined.I also liked the actor's performances. We have to realize, though, that this is not a play by Shakespeare, but a 'space opera' where the story and the action scenes are what matters. The character that stands out the most is Chanceler Palpatine/Lord Sidious/Imperador Palpatine. He's so well played by Ian McDiarmid that the viewer suffers when he sees the way he orchestrates all the events of the movie and tricks Anakin in all his schemes. Awesome. Ewan McGregor, as Obi-Wan, is also very good, honoring the late Sir Alec Guiness. Who watches the movie wonders if its the same person that is playing this much more young Ben Kenobi. Hayden Christensen also plays well here: you can tell he's a tormented person, divided by his obligation to the Jedi, his friendship with Obi-Wan, the tricks of Palpatine, the love of Padmé and their soon-to-be-borned offspring. Congratulations, Anakin's turn to the dark side is very well represented. On the other hand, I think Natalie Portman just «stood there», not doing much, not even in the most tear-jerking scenes with Hayden (altough they had good chemistry this time around). One thing is certain: she's even more beautiful.To conclude, the movie is filled with spectacular moments. Anybody who likes the 'Star Wars' universe is «force persuaded» to love 'Revenge Of The Sith'. IT'S THAT GOOD!!! Congratulations to all the cast and crew, especially to George Lucas. He showed us that he is still capable of doing a kick-ass movie in all aspects, considering that the last two episodes that were kind of disappointing (I liked them both, II more than I, but in general they are so-so).Highly recommended!! You have to see this movie in the theater more than once to really assimilate everything!! The best movie of '05 so far.Final rating: 9/10 May The Force Be With Us!! P.S.: Now, let's get the TV series going!!",9,1,3,24 May 2005
