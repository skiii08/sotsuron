The King's Speech," A Worthy Winner & Outstanding Cast
","A very patient and rewarding movie, captured the story and a brilliant performance by Firth. Lots to like about the performances, the period costumes, and the drama of the times. Quite a powerful story and although the plot followed the story, the side pieces with daughters, Corgi's and the press kept the movie interesting and unpredictable. I liked the build up between King and speech writer, keeping true to the original and keeping the Australian personality front and center. Rush was interesting but not at his best in a protagonist role, lacked some gravitas on this one. A mixed bag this year in terms of candidates for best picture and this clearly stood out as a worthy winner.",8,0,0,28 June 2011
The Sound of Music," Ageless and Pure
","I must admit to knowing the words of the songs before seeing the entire movie as a child. What a magical movie to watch as a child, and even more rewarding with your own children. You somehow get lost in the family and contradictions of war, song, lyrics and love. It flows like a musical at times, cutting from song to song, but manages to involve all the characters over time, and in great depth. Wonderful score and priceless performances. You can't take away any of the elements, and although I'm not sure how you could put them together again for another era? Julie Andrews was magnificent and for my daughter it has stuck with her for years. A must see for families and a beautiful introduction to movies made in that era.",8,4,12,28 June 2011
