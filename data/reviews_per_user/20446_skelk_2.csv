The Blair Witch Project," The most terrifying horror film ever....
","What! I hear you cry! How can you say in your summary that this is the most terrifying horror film ever.... and then give it 1/10? Well, the first time I watched this film it was just a horrifically bad film. The thought of watching it again frightens me to death. This film takes the whole concept of movie making and rips its head off and craps down its neck. The 'artistic' use of camera technique is just a way to say we know nothing about the rules of filming and have no concept of when it is applicable to ignore them. And for those who say it was meant to look like a documentary then I say give me an example of any documentary that makes you feel dizzy and sick because they can't hold the camera steady? Michael J Fox could hold a camera steadier.",1,2,5,8 March 2006
United 93," Utter Dross right until the action at the end
","Out of respect for the people that actually were part of this disaster I firstly have to say the events in this film are based mainly on conjecture. Now to the film... or rather DocuFilm. 5 minutes of watching some people shave and singing about Allah. 15 minutes of airport check in and people reading papers and ordering coffee. About an hour of watching airport control scratch their bums. Then about 30 minutes of really good film. Spot the reality check? The only decent part of the film is the bit that gave Hollywood license to make it up. The acting is good but they put a real bad vibe on the people in charge. Gee, I am glad I am not one of those guys in real life, this film would make me wanna crawl under a rock. None of the characters were developed at all - mostly cardboard. The only one that had any character development had very few lines and was the terrorist flying the plane. No real character stands out and develops a rapport with the audience other than this guy. I ticked the spoiler button because this film spoiled my day. Watch the film by all means but make sure you turn up an hour late.",2,1,8,9 June 2006
