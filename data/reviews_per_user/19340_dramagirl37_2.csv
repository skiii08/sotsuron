Walk the Line," Love Burns Burns Burns
","This post contains MAJOR spoilers-Do not read unless you've seen the movieI loved this movie. It shows that you can't control who you love and love makes you do crazy things. Johnny is like most country artists born poor in Arkansas to tenant farmers, June best known from the singing Carter family. The two meet at Johnny's first big gig. Johnny instantly is won over by June's sense of humor and beauty. Despite both being wed to another, they develop a warm friendship.But fame has a dark side, Johnny begins using drugs and drinking a lot of booze. June tries anyway she can to get John clean, including taking all his medicine and flushing it down. Johns downward spiral continues. He gets arrested for possession, and his marriage (which has been failing for a while) takes a final turn, when his wife leaves and takes their daughters with him. Johnny then gets a spot by himself and pines only for June. She is disgusted by the sight of him but Johnny won't give up on the woman he loves. He shows he can change and that he loves her more than anything, the night of they sing together after a while apart Johnny has proposed over 30 times but she still says no.She tells him in the dressing room that he is only allowed to speak to her on stage tonight. While singing Jackson Johnny stops in the middle of the song, June is confused but continues singing, Johnny then announces that he can't sing the song until he asks June something. He then asks June one final time saying that he knows he did some bad things, but he only wants to be a part of her life, he just wants to take care of her. June finally says yes and it begins their life together.The acting blew me away. Joaquin Phoenix captured Johnny Cash. He showed his bad and his good sides with such dedication. Reese did amazing as June Carter, she hit every emotional note. Gennifer Goodwin won me over too showing a woman who was in love but the love died out. I recommend this film to anyone, it is a truly beautiful film and deserved to be viewed by all.",9,1,2,1 June 2006
Corpse Bride," Amazing Love Tale
",Despite it's title which may scare people into not seeing it Corpse Bride is actually an amazing love story. I've been a Tim Burton fan since Edward Scissorhands and I've haven't been disappointed yet. Also the perfect mixture of humor along with scenes that will touch your heart. I recommend this movie to any Tim Burton fan or any one who is looking for a funny love tale. I hope this turns out to be a classic like The Nightmare Before Christmas. Heaven knows when this is released I'll be buying. I hope others enjoy this wonderful tale as much as me. The music is overdone I must admit but it is still amazing. Hope this comment helps.,8,0,1,16 October 2005
