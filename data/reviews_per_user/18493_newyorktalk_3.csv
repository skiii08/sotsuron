Requiem for a Dream," A 5 STAR MOVIE PERIOD! ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN!!!
","**** NO REAL SPOILER HERE ****
Well, where can I begin! Most of what I want to say- has already been said already..but I must reaffirm many of those points. I am tempted to call any of those self-assured 'critics' who had the unmitigated audacity to pan this movie idiots, morons, dopes, smug, self-conceited fools who feel themselves superior to the vast masses...but I won't (call the 'critics' who had the AUDACITY to pan this movie the dopes that I feel we all know they are)..I don't want the IMDB review board to remove my Post. Now, that being said- let me say that this is ONE of the best movies I've ever seen featuring probably the greatest (at least one of) screen performances ever recorded on film (by ELLEN BURSTYN). Jennifer Connelly is incredible..incredibly sexy, gorgeous and believable in her supporting role. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans take their careers to the Next Level. Darren Aronofsky along with his D.P. and D.E. have made a true modern-day masterpiece that literally THUNDERS from opening credits to heart shattering climax. (No denouement). Now I'm not gonna name drop alot of other film maker names like some reviewers do on IMDB to prove how knowledgeable I am or why my review should be take more seriously because I am so 'well-informed'. I will simply say the truth- This movie disturbed, moved and shook me...and it will You as well!!!
Oh Yeah...Ellen Burstyn got ROBBED at the Oscars..plain and simple!!",Null,0,0,29 May 2001
Men in Black II," You Over-Serious Critics Kill Me!! -Good Film for what it was worth.
","*** No Spoilers *** Just reading through the barrage of negative criticism of this movie, honestly gave me a good chuckle. I had no idea that there were so many latter-day Siskel & Eberts/Eberts & Roper's out there! You work yourselves into a lather trying to break down this movie into story arcs and plotlines that left you unsatisfied, Give me a Break. This movie never PRETENDED to be any sort of serious art drama that should legitimately receive the critical redaction so many of you are just itching to give it. Like a prior 'reviewer' said: this is just a 'light-hearted romp'! It's a comic-strip-turned-movie primarily aimed at families seeking a two-hour diversion. It contains enough action/ adventure/ Special FX and one-liners to keep the average family of four entertained.  If you're complaining that there isn't enough meat-in-your- movie, then your beef isn't with tommy lee or will smith- it's with mainstream commercial movie making on the whole!",Null,0,0,8 July 2002
8 Mile," 'Karate Kid' + 'FlashDance' only with Rap.
","*** very, very mild spoilers ***Now onto this movie: I liked it. But unless you are a fan of hiphop first, I can't see how you'd fully appreciate it.  There's ALOT of Rap in this movie. They rap EVERYWHERE...on line for lunch, while fixing cars, on their way to clubs etc.  I think it realistically depicted the underground hip-hop scene(where 'battles' and 'ciphers' abound). Although, in real life-it's far more intense. Now some may see this as a straight Great White Hope type movie where the white guy triumphs at the end. But others, more accurately I think, see this as a Race Doesn't Matter if you're sincere type movie. But hey, Bottom Line: if you're a fan of a ROCKY-style 'loser-becomes-winner-by-not-giving-up' flick: check out 8-mile.",Null,0,0,14 November 2002
