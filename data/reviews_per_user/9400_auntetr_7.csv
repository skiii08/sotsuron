The Avengers," NOT Worth the wait!
","Went to sneak of Avengers tonight in Austin and wish I hadn't wasted the couple hours or so! Very disappointing. Wish I had sold or given away the passes. I remember a time where the story was the most important part of the movie, instead of just smart quips and CGI explosions to make up for it. I guess it is all about making a quick buck. 'Hey, lets put all these elements together and make a killing off the rubes!' Thing is, we will accept lower and lower quality films, and have no one to blame but ourselves. Don't like silly cars that turn into metallic aliens anyone? I would wait for HBO or the like if you must see this. On a VERY related subject: who are the morons in marketing who decided that they should over-book a sneak so a good third of passes are turned away? From the angry/disappointed faces on the adults and KIDS who were leaving, I am wondering how all the bad will generated helps promote a film? They should barely over book by say, 1% so that people with lives aren't at the mercy of slackers who sit around all day with nothing else going on but to sit all day. Grade C for movie and promotion.",1,34,121,30 April 2012
Gravity," Incomplete film
","OK, this review is a million years late, but sometimes it takes a while to determine what went wrong. I like this movie, but: it was a bit short, and somehow, it felt like a last minute term paper. It was refreshing that it didn't follow the conventional plot arc, yet, again, something was missing. I don't think traveling back to before the mission would have been necessary, but maybe if we had known a little about the rest of the crew prior to the mishap,it would have provided more emotion of loss. Oddly, Sandra's character, Ryan, had no familial photos as the one crew member carried with him, to anchor her underlying despair. other than that, I think everyone did a great job. I liked the ominous danger music, even though it vaguely reminded me of 'Jaws'.",7,1,2,18 June 2015
The Girl Next Door," 'Risky Business 2: The Porn Star' Thumbs up!
","Loved the flick, but unfortunately I am one of those 'outside the demographics' that remember the other one (Risque' Bidness).I don't know if it's my weariness with T. Cruise or WHOT, but this one IS fresher. (PPPLEASE TOM, NO MORE HISTORY MOVIES!Anywhoo, my only negative comment is it seems like one writer started the show and got stuck and had drunk friends help finish it. -It kind of takes off across the field in four-wheel drive if you know what I mean.Props to Timothy Olyphant for his smarmy porn director- I'd be watching to see where he goes from here.It wraps up well though. One question? Does California and Las Vegas not card under 21? lol.Ms. Cuthbert could very well be my next ex-wife -if she likes older guys!regards, Auntetr",Null,0,0,18 April 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," I will be accused of being with a studio, but this movie rocks!
","Every summer, well almost, there is that one little movie a studio squirrels away for the end of summer release. 'American Pie' among others. Well this is the ONE for 2005! I have to admit, it looked suspect when I got the advance pass, but hey, I love a movie and a free one doesn't sting like a bad one that you paid for. I was very pleasantly surprised. I can't say I am a Steve Carell fan from his show 'The Office' on NBC -something about the networks seems to make them adept at taking something cool and making it so...not cool. I think it would play better on cable. But I digress, this movie made me laugh until I wanted to stop. I think my only critique would be the run time seems a little long (206 min, I think). The supporting cast is great, the story avoided falling into the clich√© third act conflict that you might expect. Steve Carell is a master at subtle expressions, which makes for half the humor in the show in my opinion. A study said recently that the best way to get women in a receptive emotional mood is to take them out where they will laugh -leaving the theater I have a habit of checking out people's expressions- I noticed the women's faces last night had a BIG afterglow on the way out. I bring that up, because male humor doesn't always have the same effect on women. 'Three Stooges' -need I say more? Guys, you are safe on this one with her. I gave it a '9' out of '10'.",9,6,17,11 August 2005
Jarhead," Welcome To The Suck...IF You Wanted To See The Trailer
","I would agree with the one author here on many terms. The movie doesn't have what feels like a complete story. It is more of a 'slice of a life' movie that doesn't answer all questions and leaves you with many more as you only see a specific period in the character's life. If I were betting, I'd say the adaptation of the book caused many a headache for the director and screenwriter. Adaptations are notorious for making disjointed films and this one seems another victim. Not that it is bad, there are many funny parts, many parts that wrench your gut if you have been through similar circumstances, and you do develop feelings for the characters. As for the people that saw the trailer and were hoping for another 'Top Gun', they will be disappointed. This is more about disillusionment than bravado. If the military hadn't already seen the script (I'm assuming they did, and of course denied assistance) they might be hoping to see enlistment quotas go up. Not likely, unless the appeal of the scenes of homo-erotic camaraderie in the film override the scenes of hazing, 'Dear John' letters and...well...other seriously unpleasant things. I came away with the feeling that the film tries to convey the point that the infantryman is a dying breed being replaced by technology not unlike the cowboy of the old west who had to give up the open range to settle down and drive a truck to work. All in all, I would recommend seeing this movie and look forward to the Oscars for nominations, especially for Sarsgaard.",6,5,15,2 November 2005
Batman Begins," What Other Batman Films? See This Movie!!
","Just saw this tonight (Thursday 16 June). When I first heard of the project, I thought 'Another one? Christian Bale???' I forgot all that in a hurry! This film is what the others should have been. I found it more credible and realistic than the others and the acting gave it the depth that the others failed to create. The 'new' Batmobile ROCKS! Essentially, scrap the other shows as this is not really a 'prequel' it is a fresh start. The telling of the parent's demise and the origin of the 'Dark Knight' has been retooled, which supports this as a new series even though it hasn't been long since the last Batman. Great to see Sir Michael, the guy from '28 Days Later' and the guy from 'The Full Monte' working on this with the impeccable Mr. Freeman. Best movie I have seen this summer. 1. Batman 2. Crash 3. Cinderella Man.Cheers!",10,9,14,17 June 2005
Click," Awesome Movie!
","Saw 'Click' tonight -went in thinking 'Adam Sandler movie...probably a few laughs, but ultimately, pretty lame.' -'Spanglish' aside.Awesome Movie! (I would have said this in all caps, but the bot hates shouting...worse than my freshman English professor!)Lots of laughs, but then some serious dramatic moments... Saw several women in the theater were sniffling and wiping their eyes. I did not see the second twist coming...love it when that happens.*Kate Beckinsale*...Can this woman get any hotter? I want one! That's all I need to say about her. The effects were great. I know how a lot of stuff is done, but if this was old technology, they found a new way to use it! I imagine that it must have taken a whole lot of takes to blend the live action with the stills and other live shots...I'm thinking Academy nomination on the effects. Chris Walkin...I never get tired of his weirdness.Best movie I have seen in a couple years! Sandler has redeemed himself!!!",10,3,11,25 June 2006
