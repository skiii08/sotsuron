Black Swan," Amazing!
","This movie was beyond my expectations! Natalie Portman did such a good job acting and portraying Nina as well as all the others actors did with their characters. I really enjoyed the twists in this movie like how you didn't really know if you were experiencing reality or fiction. And props to her for basically playing two roles and doing them perfectly. I especially I like how this movie made you really think like when Nina stabs Lily with the glass but actually stabs herself and at the end you still don't know if she lives or if she dies. Overall this movie has a great storyline and great actors if you haven't seen this movie you need to watch it, it's a must.-Aaron",10,1,4,15 February 2015
