The Ring," Scary?
","I haven't seen the original movie and i didn't know much about the story too, just that anyone who watched that video died in seven days. I was excited to see it cause i heard a lot from friends. I was disappointed not because it wasn't a good movie but because it wasn't scary at all. Very good storyline, creepy little girl (they always freak me out), incredible Naomi Watts but not scary. Except one or two scenes near the end nothing else made me scared. But that is just me! To wrap things up it is a good movie to watch but not the scariest out there! p.s. Maybe i wasn't scared cause i expected something incredibly scary! And what i imagined wasn't near to what i saw!",7,1,2,18 January 2005
