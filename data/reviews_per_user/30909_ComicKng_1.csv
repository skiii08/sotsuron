Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Special-effects:Wow!! Story:Eh!
","This is what I call a 'movie for the deaf' the greatest special effects I have seen (and I have seen many a movie), but then you have to listen to the dialogue.  Worst of all is Jar Jar.  I can barely stand to write his name because it brings on flashbacks worse than Vietnam.  When I saw the movie the first time I said wow at the special effects and wow at the horridness of Jar Jar.  I sat on the edge of my seat just hoping he would die painfully by the end of the movie.  And then I saw it again(For the special effects)and even though I knew the outcome I still sat on the edge of my seat hoping that Jar Jar's grizzly demise would come soon. On a final note If you are a diehard Star Wars fan you will like this movie no matter what I say and even if you're not a Star Wars fan it will still be a fun, enjoyable (with the exception of Jar Jar)experience. BOTTOM LINE: See the movie, bring some ear plugs.",6,0,1,16 July 1999
