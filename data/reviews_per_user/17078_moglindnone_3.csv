Iron Man 3," Compare it to movies in it's group (3rd sequels)
","I'm way behind on this I know guys. I just never was too interested in this. But all my friends saw it and half of them told me it sucked and it was terrible and then the other half told me it was great, that it was better than the first two.Well, neither of those statements are true. I don't understand all the hate. It was fine. Better than Spiderman 3. I don't know really how to review this other than just saying it's better than 'these movies' and saying that it's really not that bad. The action was good. The story wasn't cheesy, which is always good in a super hero movie. And for anyone upset of the ending of the movie by Tony Starks decision, I'm sure that it'll all be resolved in 'The Avengers'It was not terrible. I'd say it's better than the second but not as good as the first. It's a decent super hero movie. Better than 'Wolverine' just because the plot isn't stupid. I did however, think the president in danger was a little cliché. Cliché, NOT terrible.It was a disappointment to hear that the mandarin, Iron Man's greatest foe, was a floozy.But you have to compare it to other movies in it's group.",7,2,4,15 August 2013
No Country for Old Men," The Coen's crown jewel
","'No Country for Old Men'I watched this like 2 weeks ago, but I like to let these things sink in. Wow. Without a doubt in my mind, this is the best Coen brothers film to date. The thing that stood out to me the most was the fact that there was absolutely no score. Zero. 100% silence as far as music goes (except for that part where he's in Mexico and there's a mariachi band there but there's only music cause that's actually in the scene.) It gets you. Makes everything so much more tense. That scene when Javier Bardem's character is standing outside of Josh Brolin's room waiting for him? Couldn't breathe if I wanted to. And let's take a second to just commend Javier Bardem for some disgustingly amazing psychotic characterization. One of the best supporting roles I've ever seen in film hands down. Coen brothers this is your gem. Your crowned Jewel. And you rightfully won Best Picture, Best supporting actor, and best adapted screenplay, and best directing. And that's what I love about them. They do it both, writing and directing. And each and every movie they put out is not in any shape or form like the last. Truly a remarkable well of originality. 10/10",10,1,2,23 January 2014
Raging Bull," Classic Among Classics. Martin Scorsese's masterpiece.
","'Raging Bull'I watched this a couple days ago, but as I said, I enjoy letting the greatness sink in when I find a diamond in the rough. Just 'No Country for Old Men' is the Coen brothers crown jewel, this is Martin Scorsese's crown jewel. This is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece in my opinion. There is nothing better that he has done. THE SCORE! The right music can really light up a film and bring it to life. Robert De Niro's character of Jake La Motta and his rage intertwined with a beautiful classical symphony is put together with such ease and draws you in, and it makes you wonder. He plays the black and white off so sincerely. The lighting every time they stepped into the ring, everything really popped. The smoke that was caught in the air that appeared to be intentionally grainy. Everything. Robert De Niro giving one of the most well deserved best actor academy award winning performances ever to be witnessed on screen. And Joe Pesci, I apologize once again. I underestimated you and had a skewed vision of what you were like as an actor that was created from 'Home Alone'; you too, truly are talented. Their chemistry was great. The way that Cathy Moriarty put her lips together to make them seem so small and cute. It's not even really about boxing, it's more about Jake La Motta and what a terrible person he was and how sad his life became. This is not a movie of redemption. Beautiful. Marvelous. Classic. Genius. Genuine.'You never got me down, Ray. You never got me down.'10/10",10,2,2,23 January 2014
