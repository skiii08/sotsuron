Hereditary," The definition of a waste of time
","It's alright for a film to be boring; it's a flaw, but as long as there's a point to the film it can be forgiven. Hereditary puts your life in perspective, but showing you exactly how long 2 hours of your time can feel.Oftentimes it insults your intelligence, has nothing happening, and you're left sitting there thinking 'well, this ending better be fantastic, otherwise I just wasted 7 hours of my life'. The ending isn't worth it, the film meanders, and gives you the same frustration as a car meandering ahead of you on the highway.You'd have a better time working a menial job for two hours.",1,5,9,22 November 2018
