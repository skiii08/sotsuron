Iron Man 3," Good Film
","IRON MAN 3 is just plain awesomeness. I think Ben Kingsley did such a good job that I think I'm okay with the feel steering away slightly from the comics.I am excited about Robet Downey Jr coming back in an Avengers film and playing this character. He has done is so skillfully that quite frankly, I am not sure who they are thinking of to do it later. IRON MAN 3 features so many unique amazing costumes that I was just so pleased with the design aspects. a good movie all around. There are a plethora of suits that show up that fans will be pleased who can name them all.Pepper Potts, is probably the most dynamic character in the film, and I don't want to give anything away, but she challenges Iron Man in a way that reminds me of Superman/WonderWoman dynamics.",9,20,33,6 October 2013
