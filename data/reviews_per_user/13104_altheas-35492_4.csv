The Blair Witch Project," Loved This Film Style
",I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It was very suspenseful and I liked that if was filmed so simply. It was first person and you really felt what the characters were feeling. The way he camera moved made you feel more a connection to the film and it almost felt like you were there with them. In my opinion this film was a suspense film. I don't consider it a horror movie because you never see any thing gory or demons or monsters. At the beginning of the movie a man explains how the Blair Witch kills people; she takes two people into the basement. She makes one person face the wall while she kills the other one and then she kills the next one. She didn't like to feel there eyes on her as she killed. When Heather walked into the basement she was knocked down and the camera was focused on Kevin standing in the corner. This suggests that Mike was being killed or had been killed and Mike was next. Presumably Heather would have had to have stood in the corner next and would have been killed after Josh was killed. This movie was one of my explains movies filmed in this style. I liked the way it made you feel connected to the characters and it made it more real and intense. After the filming ends I assume that Heather and Kevin would be killed. I'm very happy I watched this movie and hope to see the second on soon.,8,0,1,26 October 2017
The Shining," A Movie Worth Watching Twice
",After watching The Shinning for a second time I began to realize small details that I didn't notice while watching the first time. Kubrick left small and subtle details unexplained. These small details explains much bigger things that some people may not realize. Native American genocide was subtly hinted throughout the movie. We first hear about this when the hotel manager is telling Jack that the Overlook Hotel was built on 'Indian' Burial Grounds. Later in the film Jack is seen throwing a ball at a Native American art. Jack killed Dick Holloraan on a native drawing on the ground. Lastly Wendy is seen wearing dresses similar the the native American culture and her hair is black and bone straight. I enjoyed analyzing this film and enjoyed watching it too. I was able to think about was has happening and what the connection may be to other things in the movie instead of just watching it and moving on. This was the first movie I watched twice to find small details that I didn't notice.,7,0,1,7 November 2017
Get Out," Very Well Made Movie
","This movie was very interesting. When it started I thought it was a bit boring but by the end I was sitting on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. The begging was very calm and seemed like it was going to movie about a family reunion. I was wrong! As soon as The couple got in the car the movie took a turn. Once they arrived at Rose's family home we meet her parents, brother and the maid that work for the family. Something seems off with the maids and this makes Chris uncomfortable . As the trip continues, Rose's family starts to arrive and Chris notices they are all white. The only African American people are the maid and Chris. Once the family leaves weird things start to happen and Chris decides they have to leave. The Family turns against Chris and tries to brain wash him. This movie was not what Expected it to be. The movie had two ending, I prefer the ending where Chris gets arrested. It much more realistic and easy to believe.",7,14,26,12 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," A Good Movie Made About a Bad Movie
","I really enjoyed this movie. I haven't watched 'The Room' and don't feel like I need to watch it after watching 'The Disaster Artist'. At the end of the movie just before the credits we see the comparison of the original and the clips from t his movie. They are so similar and well done. Personally, I like that they made a documentery about one of the worst films ever made. Wiseau was not nessisarily a genius but he made his dreams come true and made his movie by himself. He was lucky to have the funds to be able to make his dreams come true.",7,0,0,9 April 2018
