Mission: Impossible III," Mission Incredible
","I left the cinema with a huge grin on my face. Mission Impossible 3 is an incredible film.Unlike the previous two in the series, MI3 sets the correct balance between style and substance. It has plenty of both. Whilst there are plenty of far-fetched scenarios, high-class performances by Cruise and Seymour-Hoffman bring an uncanny sense of believability. The unrelenting pace of the movie, and the extraordinarily clever set pieces will keep you completely fixated right the way through. You won't question a single moment. In fact, your mind is unlikely to wander at any point in the film. You certainly won't be looking at your watch. Director JJ Abrams is a master of audience control, as he demonstrated with Lost. His strength is in merging beautiful backdrops with intense action, whilst retaining the qualities of both. The locations and sets are dazzling, and hugely atmospheric. The soundtrack hits the spot, too.You will love this movie, whoever you are. This is an experience that justifies a trip to the cinema - don't wait for the DVD.",9,1,3,6 May 2006
Being John Malkovich," Appalling
","This is the first film I've seen that's been so unbearable I've had to turn it off. I bought the DVD after reading the gushing reviews here on IMDb. The concept was excellent and I love movies with an unusual story. I watched it with several house-mates, most of which left the room before I stopped the movie.I was appalled by the shallow characterisation, the lack of any comedy, in fact the lack of any endearing quality whatsoever. Some scenes were such a cacophony (the chimps in particular) that it suggested the film had been constructed from outtakes.All in all, 'Being John Malkovich' is an incredible waste of a concept and talented actors - a film so unlikeable that it's practically offensive.To all those reviewers that bigged up this dog of a movie -- you wasted an hour of my life - you suck!",1,61,137,14 May 2005
