Minority Report," Goofy !
","Goofy !  I felt MR's tech effects were a hollow and irritatingly amateurish attempt to copy Blade Runner which was immeasurably a better story and also tech presentation than MR. This was a real let down and esp after reading Ebert's and others' phony glowing reviews. MR never explained what the heck a minority report was either. Just total goofy. Futuristic nonsense story line also. From Three Days of the Condor with Von Sydow, we already have seen the story line in its full blown  presentation.  This MR was also a tiny and disappointing copy of his role in 3 Days.  I could recommend this movie but only with tagline of 'grade school-blocks level copycat' and too 'goofy.'",Null,0,0,27 January 2004

Incredible futuristic story line also. From Three Days of the Condor with Von Sydow, we already have seen the finale story line in its full blown  presentation.  This MR bordered on being a tiny copy of his role in 3 Days.  I could recommend this movie but only with taglines of 'grade school-blocks level copycat' (the space vehicles were from circa 1925 level of competence) and an overall 'goofy.' It just wasn't worth it, except for the Agatha actress. Tom was good of course, but Spielberg's, etc storyline and tech effects made it just too goofy for me.",Null,0,1,27 January 2004
Spider-Man," A let down
","I see no reason why this movie couldn't have been interesting even to an adult. But the writers and producers did. Spiderman: checked out at public library and viewed Oct 29, 2004Adults will not tolerate this flick. The tiresome central villain was cartooned, obnoxious & always screaming . Also the movie was heavy with thrown bombs and unending fires . The thick violence was trite (corny, meaningless, and boring ) ........ a junk movie . Hats off to smart actor Cliff Robertson, who after reading the script decided to get killed off early on. Cliff is no fool.best,Phadellius",Null,0,1,29 October 2004
