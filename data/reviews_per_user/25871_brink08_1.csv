Black Swan," The art of dancing and its thrilling story!
","The movie Black Swan created in the year 2010 by the director Darren Aronofsky, visualizes a film based on the popular 'Swan Lake'. Black Swan was written by MARK Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John J. McLaughlin. This film features a ballet dancer named Nina Sayers, played by Natalie Portman, and shows her strength to become the lead in this classical dance. From good to bad and right from wrong, Nina Sayers has to trouble herself and transform to become a stronger person in order to play the part of the Swan Queen. This part not only is courageous and beautiful, but Nina has to factor in being diverse and create something raw and plain into an amazing task. Nina Sayers and her partner Lily, who is the Black Swan in this film, play hand and hand. Mila Kunis in this film plays that special character of the Black Swan and in many ways gives Nina that extra edge to being who she truly needs to be. Not only is her relationship with Lily is negative and exciting at the same time, this character Lily seems to be a vivid imagination of sorts.The theme of the movie Black Swan has a lot to do with conflict involving a lot of discriminating self-esteem issues women face in a daily life. The need to be perfect and the desire to look and feel like they are perfect is all in this movie. Nina Sayers is determined to find her inner-strength in order to become the dark and deceptive character that the Russian folklore created. Not only is Nina becoming a new and more confident person, she ends up also finding a more sexual side that is mentoring her ability to become the part of the Swan Queen. The theme of this movie also surrounds many internal and external conflicts on the overall life of being a woman. The daily struggles living with a controlling mother who wants her child to live her dream, and a daily struggle of just living in general. A movie that may be comparable to the theme of what woman deal with in regards to self-esteem issues would be Juno. This movie is comparable because of the fact that the main character deals with becoming a stronger woman and someone that she is currently not. Juno gives a viewer the inside scoop on how life may be if you are a teen-aged girl in life and being pregnant at the same time. Even though the plots of these two films are totally different, the overall ending of how happy these characters are with the changes they have endured is heart warming and beautiful. Everything is motivating Nina into becoming one of the greatest parts of the popular dance 'Swan Lake'. Two techniques that the director uses in Black Swan are the great use of lighting and angle. The reason why I think that the technique of the lighting in this movie is great is because it helps show emphasis on the white and dark characters in the film. Nina Sayers in the beginning of the film is a bright and pretty lady but heading more towards the end of the film, the lighting at many points becomes darker and more defined. I would imagine this to be because of her transformation into a new character and becoming something even more great! The technique of using angle in this movie is also very exquisitely done because in ballet, the art of dancing and movement needs to be fluent. The way that the camera would move with the dancers feet and movements is just amazing and really brings the audience to the feeling of reality and being there in the stands watching the performance! There is nothing better than a young lady finding her true self in life. As the true womanhood of Nina grows, the only feeling felt in the end of Black Swan is empowerment!",8,0,1,3 May 2014
