The Devil's Advocate," Great acting, great storyline, great ending.
","Sometimes I wonder what people expect in a movie. Have we been presented with so many special effects and original storylines in the last few years that now we are spoilt?This movie was fantastic, I thought that Pacino was unbelievable, he really made the movie.In the end though I did not take heed of his words: 'Look, but don't touch. Touch, but don't taste. taste, but don't swallow!'I swallowed this movie right up. Excellent, 9/10 !!!",9,1,1,1 December 1998
The Exorcist," Should not have bothered the second time round
","I first saw this movie when I was about 8-9 years old and thought it was the creepiest thing ever back then.Well I have always thought that you need to see a good movie twice in order to really appreciate it and that is what I attempted to do with 'The Exorcist'. Ten years after my first viewing I had forgotten why it had scared me so much.Well, I shouldn't have bothered. Granted, now I am 18 and not quite as easily scared, but really I have to say that I struggled to keep my eyes open. I guess some of the scenes were 'powerful', for the early 70's, however most movies have at least one 'powerful' moment in them.Definitely a great big bore, but I guess for an 8 year old kid who is easily scared this is the film for you!",Null,1,3,30 November 1998
