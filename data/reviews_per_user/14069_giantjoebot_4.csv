Sucker Punch," I felt like I had just been lobotomized by this movie
","I'm not sure where to begin. This movie is like a really long music video, and a bad one at that. Think Linkin Park mixed with Lady Gaga, for 2 hours straight. The sound track is great, but they are all cover songs, and nothing original. I think the music in the movie was the only good thing.The action scenes are like watching someone play a video game. Actually I think that watching someone play a video game might be more entertaining than watching this movie. Things that are wrong with the plot. Fist off last will and testaments are not kept in peoples desk, they are kept by a lawyer. Second, she would not have been taken to a mental hospital by her step father in an incident like that. She would have been taken there by the police. Third, there seemed to be no police investigation whatsoever.The main character, always seems to fight, and then give up at the end just before she is about to win. She fought to escape out the window and get a gun, and then look how that turned out. Then she does the same thing through the rest of the movie.The main character, baby doll, looks just like that, a doll. Her face does not move. She looks fake, as in to much plastic surgery, so much that her face can't move. Or maybe its the anorexia, because the only fat that a saw on that girl was in her lips, and I wonder if that's real or something else.All and all, I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the trailer, but after watching it I feel like my IQ just dropped. No honestly, my brain feels foggy. This is not a movie that makes you think, its a movie that kills brain cells.",1,8,16,23 June 2011
Mama," It not bad, but not good either
","It started out good, and had lot of promise, but failed to deliver. This movie had a ton of potential, but never got there. It just wasn't scary. It never drew me in. It feels like all the parts for a good movie were there, but they just weren't put together right. 10 lines of text fine. The ghost appears to early. It lacked suspense. The characters were predictable. The girls crawling around was great, but it wasn't scary. Visually the movie was done really well, but it just din't work. I have seen way worse movies, but I have also seen way better. If you have absolutely nothing better to do go ahead and watch this, buy looking out your window might be more entertaining. Its totally forgettable, and a waste of time, but I'm not angry that I watched it either.",4,5,11,21 April 2013
Dark Shadows," A High School Goth's wet dream
","A high school Goth's wet dream, let me count the ways. He's a Vampire. Nothing is his fault, its all the witches fault. Having sex with your psychiatrist, and also killing her. Being cursed by a witch that he has crazy sex with. No one understands me because I see the ghost of my past life, and they throw me in a mental institution. Having a huge party with Alice Cooper singing. So I heard this is a spoof of an old soap opera, which I could not relate to since I'm not old enough to remember the show, I'm 33. I did enjoy the acting, costumes, and the cinematography in general. There were a few parts that I laughed at. But ultimately the story lacked depth. I never grew to care about the characters. So even if this is a spoof of a really old show, the story wasn't good enough to make it interesting to audiences that are unfamiliar with the show. I loved everything about the Movie except for the story, which seems to me like something a high schooler would write.",5,1,2,1 September 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Are these reviews fake or are people just morons
","Its was entertaining, but after I watched I was really surprised to find such a high rating on IMDb. Where the hell did Sigourney Weaver come from. You can't just drop in characters like that. I learned that in 6th grade English. It bad story telling. And what was with the clown, white mask people, and unicorn. That was kind of lame. There really isn't much more to say. It was different, entertaining, but not mind blowing or revolutionary. It just makes me wonder where all these high rating come from. They could be fake. It could just be one of those films that you either love or hate. Personally I think that movies like the Evil Dead series were much better.",4,34,70,15 August 2012
