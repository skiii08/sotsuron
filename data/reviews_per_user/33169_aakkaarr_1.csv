Skyfall," It lacks a real plot, which is known for bond movie.
","It lacks a real plot, which is known for bond movie. Sometimes its really boring as when shaving of bond by Eve. It is really a gun fighting even some TV serials are better. It lacks the magnificent sets that are usually there. No real story line. Action sequences at the start are good. Moonracker is better than this movie. The villain puts out stunts from not known things. Daniel Greg is good. Lack story. Expect better from Bond Movie. For the 50th Bond movie it is not as expected. Even the Burn Notice TV serial is better watching. Sometimes it is too slow for a Bond movie.Lots of gun fighting. The escape of Villain from prison is also is very unrealistic.",1,11,20,20 November 2012
