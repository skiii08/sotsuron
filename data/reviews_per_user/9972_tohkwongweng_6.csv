Hereditary," Witchcraft and Demonic possession
","I was hoping to catch this one on the big screen but due to work and family commitments was unable to,so I bought the dvd. I'm glad now that I missed it. Obviously Hollywood critics have absolutely no idea what makes a really great scary movie and there is no conceivable way this deserves any more than a 2 and I gave it that because the scares, mild as they were, only came in the last 15 minutes. The rest of the movie was incredibly boring and absolutely too long. Additionally I had to put up with depressing issues of anger, hate, resentment and guilt! Of course the demon King Paimon, one of the 8 kings of hell, finds an easy target! Didn't quite understand either why it was called 'Hereditary' either, other than Grandma being a satanic witch who cursed her own family. And why all the naked old ghosts towards the end? Nonsensical! What was the significance of headless grandma's corpse? Nothing made sense and no decent answers were provided! Was Charlie a witch in making too or just an unwilling victim? 2 hours I wasted on this one. Give it a really wide berth, seriously.",2,0,3,8 November 2018
28 Weeks Later," Absolutely brilliant
",Much better than 28 Days. The descent into chaos began with a simple kiss between husband and wife. Dad (Don) became the first to be newly infected and commits the first Rage killing no less on Mum (Alice). Brilliant medicine that Mum was a carrier of the Rage virus yet immune to its symptoms because of a genetic abnormality causing one green eye and one brown which she shared with Andy. Looked like Dad and Tammy weren't so lucky. The ferocity of the virus was definitely dialed up a notch. And despite the US Army's over the top attempt to eradicate the virus it was a dismal failure. The ending just showed the futility of it all....one of the best genre horror movies ever. Another one for the collection. Almost the perfect scary movie.,9,1,1,22 August 2019
Saw III," As good as the first.
","Loved it loved it loved it! Nicely tied up all the loose ends, although few and far between. Really liked how everything in Saw 1 and 2 was so ingeniously wrapped up. Pity Jigsaw had to die though. Despite the macabre and horrific nature of his crimes he gave all the ready and willing victims a choice and they all chose wrongly and paid the ultimate price. Really glad I binge watched 1,2 and 3. Everything made perfect sense and the planning involved to execute his game, although mind-boggling at times, was sheer brilliance. These 3 are going to go down as some of my all-time favourite scary movies and are a worthy addition to anyone's scary movie collection. 9.5/10",9,1,2,17 November 2018
Event Horizon," Really good sci-fi horror
",Definitely one of the best sci-fi horror movies ever. Even though much of the impending evil was implied or glimpsed it was enough to imagine how bad it could have been if it was unleashed. Loved watching Sam Neill as the brilliant but insanely evil Dr Weir. Obviously some shades of Clive Barker's Hellraiser throughout but it was all good in the context of the possessed space ship. Another one for the horror movie collection for sure.,9,3,4,29 August 2019
Saw," Crazy good!
","I watched this one again after a 14 year absence and was reminded what an excellent scary movie this is. The sick ways in which the victims all succumbed or in the case of Amanda, nearly succumbed, was truly from the mind of a genius in the genre. Plus the ending was absolutely killer and THAT is what makes a truly great scary movie. I also liked the message that Jigsaw wanted to tell his victims: Be grateful. The story was not so complex that I had to ask questions and any questions that I may have had were so very neatly tied together in the final closing minutes. Definitely one for any scary movie aficionados' collection. 9.5/10",9,1,2,17 November 2018
It Chapter Two," Absolutely loved it!
","As a huge Stephen King fan I have been eagerly awaiting Chapter 2 and this I'm really happy to say, it didn't disappoint. Definitely upped the scare factor and at several junctures in the movie I got goosebumps. And that's the measure of a great scary movie. How good was the Scary Grandma? What a work of genius! Possibly one of the best contemporary horror movies ever and as someone who almost exclusively watches only scary movies i've had a lot to compare against. There were some derivative scenes (think M Night Shyamalam-The Visit and John Carpenter-The Thing) but they were essential to the creepiness factor. In no way did it detract from the quality. The only reason why it's not a 10/10 is because it was a tad too long and that can be my only criticism. Put that aside and appreciate the movie.",7,5,10,7 September 2019
