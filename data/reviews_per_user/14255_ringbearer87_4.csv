The Devil's Advocate," Prepare to be gobsmacked!
","What a surprisingly rewarding film. I have not watched a film that is so engaging for a long while. I had never even heard of the film before and only saw it by chance on the shelf at the video store. I am glad I picked it up as I enjoyed every minute of it. The Devil's advocate is heavy viewing, it is not a light cinema experience, yet it is rewarding in it's heaviness. It is very clever depicting the devil realistically and giving a totally truthful example of how people can un-knowingly be sucked in by evil. The film though dealing with a unrealistic concept is totally believable due the the fantastic acting by all involved. Keanu Reeves gives the performance of a life time, he is perfectly cast opposite Charliez Theron who is also very impressive. The two posses an obvious chemistry. I recommend you see this movie ASAP!",10,73,91,17 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The most highly anticipated film of the year...did it live up to expectations?
","Well, it's a question not to be answered lightly. It leaves one feeling as though they are stuck in the middle...did we like it better then the first or didn't we? We can't answer! We don't know! TTT is so different to FOTR yet at the same time is so the same. The tone of the film is different and some characters are developed more eg Frodo & gollum. while many are not eg Saruman. New characters were introduced and all were acted brilliantly yet unfortunately we didn't get the chance to form a bond with them as we did with the fellowship in the first film as there just wasn't enough time to get to know them. The 2nd book is undoubtedly the hardest of the 3 books to translate into film. It is also the hardest to read. There are three different stories to follow and though the film interchanged between characters seemlessly unfortunately the story seemed to stray a little from it's main focus: Frodo and his quest to destroy the ring. Yet The film was brilliant, don't get me wrong. Everyone went in with very high expectations which is never a good thing when seeing a film, yet none left feeling very disappointed. The opening scene was one of the best, with the camera panning over mountains with whispers of dialogue from the first film to be heard in the background and then the reply of Gandalfs 'death' but from different angles to keep fans from feeling cheated. The music was also a huge highlight keeping old themes and adding new ones. The actor who developed the most in this film and who is also terribly under-appreciated was Elijah Wood. His character changed so much from what it was like in FOTR. He is obviously and believably falling ill to the ring and his evil spells were very disturbing to watch as was the relationship between himself, Sam and Gollum - perhaps the best ever CGI character to date. It would have been nice to see a little more of them and also a bit more of Merry and Pippin. Bilbo's complete absence was also a down point. A little less Arwen to make room for Bilbo wouldn't have gone astray, yet the flashbacks let us learn the true depth and strains of Arwen and Aragorn relationship. Over all TTT is a brilliant film though I seem to have focused on mainly the bad points. It is alot funnier and darker and more unsettling. The beautiful scenery in still there looking wonderful and all the actors were magnificent. Peter Jackson had done a marvelous job translating the hardest of the 3 books into film! I give it a 9/10 and I will certainly be going to see it for the 4th time tomorrow!",10,0,0,29 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The more you see it, the more you love it
","Lets just say that I saw TTT for the 3rd time yesterday and enjoyed it more then all the other times I have seen it and will definitely be going again. It's a film you cannot see just once, there is too much to see and absorb - too much to gain. You miss out on half the fun and excitement if you only go once. Infact the 1st time I saw it was the time I was least satisfied, though I still loved it then. It has a brilliant cast and a brilliant storyline and top-notch effects, what more could you want? Elijah Wood in particular stood out in this film as his character had changed immensely to what it had been in the 1st film. He played Frodo's evil streak in a very convincingly frightening way. Sean Astin once again delighted audiences with his lovable portrayl of Samwise and Andy Serkis played Gollum ot perfection! With spectacular battles and with all the likeable ( and not so likeable) characters all there to please us, this film cannot go astray. And the oscar goes too....",10,0,0,1 January 2003
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Very different from the other films, but fantastic!!
","Firstly lets point out that I am a Harry Potter fan. I am a big fan of the books, and though the films will never be as good, they have done well at capturing JK Rowling's wondrous world on the screen.So far each film has improved upon the last, perhaps owing to the fact that the characters/actors grow older with each film, thus each installment becomes more adult. So it would be fair to say I had high expectations for this film, the 5th in the series.Director David Yates and screenplay writer Michael Goldenberg had their work cut out for them, with the Order of the Phoenix book structured in a way that could present difficulties when translating to screen.Phoenix takes place after Voldemort has returned, yet the wizarding world is in denial, labeling Harry Potter and Dumbledore as liars, rather than believing their claims that the Dark Lord is back. Yet Harry is faced with more serious problems when he develops a psychological link to Voldemort which channels the Dark Lord's emotions through him.Unlike its four predecessors Phoenix does not play out in the conventional 'Harry' format. The first four books' plots progress with purpose, obviously building up to its climax, and the character's motives are clear throughout. Pheonix, however, is not so. The book almost plods along with less action, but heavier emotional and psychological underpinnings.This could have created a dilemma when translating the story into an engaging film; suitable for the broad audience the Harry Potter series attracts.It is clear from the first scene that Pheonix is going to be a very different film to the other in the HP series, with the use of a steady cam, and jerky filming techniques common in war films (a filming style which has not been used in any of the previous films).Phoenix has a much darker feel then the other Harry films, the enjoyable and exaggerated teenage drama of The Goblet of Fire replaced with angst and aggression.This new dark tone is very suitable to the story, and though this 'heavier' feel might not impress those fans who have become comfortable with the fun and fluffy tones of the other films, it is a needed new approach to a film series that could have easily become mundane.The heavy psychological aspect to the story could have been a challenge to adapt for film. I found myself nervous as the movie started wondering how they could possibly make Harry and Voldermort's mental link understandable and convincing.The fact that Harry feels the same emotions as Voldemort due to this link could have been hard to communicate on screen, yet Goldenberg and Yates have not shied away from the challenge tackling it head on. The result is awesome.The scenes in which Professor Snape delves into Harry's mind are  in the words of Ron Weasley  wicked! The use of flashbacks to previous films (look how little and cute they all are!) and the rapid editing are extremely effective and really add an emotional feel, reminding viewers of their connection with the three lead characters, whom they have practically watched grow up.Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter has come a long way from the wide-eyed young boy in The Philosophers Stone. He convincingly portrays a young man that is tormented mentally, adding enough aggression to his character without becoming unlikable.Dumbledore, the character that stands out most in the books, yet seems to have been neglected in the films, has a stronger presence in this movie. Phoenix finally touches on the greatness of this character and strong bond he and Harry share. The climactic battle between him and Voldermort will have your chin on the floor.The Verdict: This film follows the book more closely than the others,and though this may come as a relief to die-hard book fans, it does result in a slower moving film. Those viewers who are only loosely interested in the series may not find it as enjoyable, with viewers needing an interest in the character's emotional journeys in order to fully appreciate the film.The new darker approach to Pheonix, means the film is not a 'kid friendly' as the others, however the subject matter does not allow for sugar coating.This film is the best of the lot; the new style and tone a very welcome change. Phoenix is the most well made of the series with fantastic and original ways of piecing the scenes together (watch how they utilize the Daily Prophet newspaper). The psychological and emotional aspect of the film makes it very interesting and engaging, and will have even the adults on the edge of their seats.All I can say is: bring on the next one!",10,1,4,12 July 2007
