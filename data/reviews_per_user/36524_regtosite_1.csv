The Lobster," Don't be fooled by the high rating
",Don't be fooled by the high rating. It doesn't deserve more than 5 stars; 5 stars just for the scenes and views. Boring and very long just to say a simple sentence about the society. You can make a 15 minutes short film just to make the same point. It is not a comedy at all. I didn't see anything to make me even smile.,2,13,18,5 March 2017
