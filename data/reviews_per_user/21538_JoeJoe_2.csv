The Blair Witch Project," Very Disappointing
",I just don't get the hype. It leaves you with a 'That's it?' feeling at the end. The shaky camera can give you motion sickness!This is the first movie for which I ever wanted to get my money back.,Null,0,1,24 August 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Overrated
",This is a good action/war movie. That's it. Spielberg's directing is *too* perfect. It reminds me of a Norman Rockwell painting. Sentiment rather than emotion.,6,3,6,8 April 1999
