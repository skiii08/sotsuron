The Equalizer," Never Judge A Book By It's Cover
",This movie was AWESOME!!! You should never judge a book by it's cover because people are not always what they appear to be. I purposely do not watch movie trailers so nothing is spoiled when I actually see the film therefore I was in shock when Robert took out Slovi and his crew! WOW!!!! He was the man! I always love a storyline where a good guy rids the earth of bad people and negativity by any means necessary! (#DEXTER) Denzel's character (Robert) was one cool dude who unconventionally rid our streets of trash. His methods were necessary because the people he was dealing with were animals! I loved it! It was also great to see that it was filmed in Boston; though most of the actors made horrible attempts at the New England accent! Lol! OH WELL! Great movie and I look forward to seeing it again!,9,1,7,20 October 2014
Gone Girl," Loved the book
","As a huge fan of the book I was worried the movie wouldn't live up to it. Fortunately, they did a pretty good job capturing the general tone of the book and how absolutely crazy Amy is. The movie was much kinder in its portrayal of Nick than the book. It ended with me feeling kind of bad for him vs when I finished the book I thought of him as a spoiled narcissistic 'Man-child' who by staying with Amy would thankfully not mess up the life of an unassuming nice girl. The idea of NPH playing Desi was great casting but the movie didn't really show how psychotic he was. In the movie, it was nice to actually Amy play out her escape plan from him as well as her initial disappearance vs in the book when they were referenced as things done in the past. To those who haven't read the book, I hope they enjoyed the surprises as they were revealed! I was in shock as I read! All-in-all, it was nice to visually experience and enjoy that wild story.",6,0,10,20 October 2014
