Walk the Line," slightly disappointed that i was slightly disappointed
","Well, finally saw this movie that I was so looking forward to seeing for a long time, and I can't really point out one specific problem, except maybe I thought they should've included where Johnny wanders into Nickajack Cave when he's finally at the end of his rope with his addiction. I guess after reading the biography, I pretty much knew what to expect and there were no real revelations...that said, I thought Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job portraying the Man In Black, and Reese Witherspoon played June Carter really well. I just found the whole presentation kind of boring unfortunately. So my point is if you've already read the definitive biography, then there is really no need to watch this film.",5,1,10,21 November 2005
Nacho Libre," Napoleon Dynamite connections?
","As I watched this movie, I noticed in one scene while Jack Black was talking, behind him was a tree, with a pi√±ata hanging from it, that looked suspiciously like the 'effigy' of Summer from Napoleon Dynamite.Anyone else come to this conclusion or is it just me hoping for a connection? And by the way, I was really disappointed by this movie, but of course I hated Napoleon Dynamite the first time too, so maybe it will grow on me.JCP.S. Why is there a minimum of 10 lines for these comments, I don't get it.",Null,0,0,24 October 2006
