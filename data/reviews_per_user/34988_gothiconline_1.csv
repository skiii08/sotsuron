Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," hello
","I just saw the movie, and it's funny.. but there's this problem again, the problem shows the big difference between the third world and America or the west, in other words, it shows the ignorance (or what the west think it's ignorance) of a guy from the third world who is seeing new things in this deluxe glorious new world to him, and this is really frustrating, although it's a comedy, but still it shows this real and big problem.. and i can say that the world is not America only, I have no problem with this, but what if someone asks to bring an American who's not educated and made him tour to a foreign country, i mean to make the same idea in another movie, but the American guy must be this 'borat'.. what will be the response in America, will they take it only as a comedy? or it will be something they will consider against their concepts and rules? i hope to get a reply, and i wish you good days in this month..",Null,1,3,8 December 2006
