Miracle," My wife and I loved this film!
","This was by far one of the best and most inspiring films we've seen in along time. I am sure the events surrounding the 1980 Winter Olympics have been fictionalized and perhaps exagerated somewhat. However, it was an inspiration that the youth of America could sure use. I had just graduated from High School when those events took place and it reminded me of the trials we went through in the 1970s. It was a tough time. The USSR was at their hight of power and beating them was a real boost. This may not become a blockbuster, but, it's worth seeing. Bring some older kids and youth to this film. There is 1 locker room seen and some language. Otherwise it's a good film and I'd recommend it. (BTW - I am very choosy and rarely recommend a film)",9,0,0,11 February 2004
