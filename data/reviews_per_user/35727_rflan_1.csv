Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent Movie!!!
","George Lucas is a master. How else can you explain a movie being so riveting when you already know the stories outcome (the cute little kid turns evil, Obi-Wan can't die in the fight scene, etc...). I went in expecting the worst after reading reviews of the movie and how bad it was....They were wrong!",10,0,0,17 June 1999
