Raiders of the Lost Ark," Hard-to-beat entertainment
","Producer George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg created this motion picture in an attempt to tap into the excitement and spirit of the old adventure serials they watched as young children, and they ended up topping the even the very best of the very series they were emulating in every conceivable way. Easily one the ultimate adventure films of all-time, RAIDERS is an enormously entertaining, sometimes breathtaking roller coaster ride that became watershed classic in it's own right. Lucas and Spielberg manage to find the pitch-perfect balance of updating and revitalizing serial clich√©s without sub-coming to them, and the commutation of the efforts are right on the screen. From it's very first scene onward, RAIDERS is an absolute blast that keeps getting better and better.Obviously, much of the film's success can be attributed to Harrison Ford, who (not only in this film, but also in 1977's STAR WARS and 1982's BLADE RUNNER) always manages walk the thin line between straight-faced sincerity and knowing campiness. Although I think Ford's later ventures into straight drama have been extremely uneven, there is absolutely no denying that he is perhaps Hollywood's ultimate pulp idol. The long underrated Karen Allen is great fun as the film's progressively feisty heroine, and the remainder of the cast is also expertly used. Above all else, however, it is Lucas and Spielberg who continually surprise and delight the audience again and again in this box office smash (it was the top grosser of 1981), and it arguably remains the finest joint achievement from the pair.",9,0,0,28 July 2006
X-Men," Solid comic adaptation; Jackman steals the show
","The film that brought comic book adaptations back into the Hollywood forefront, director Bryan Singer's X-MEN works for many reasons, but mainly because Singer and company take the entire premise and characters with the utmost seriousness and respect. This film does not exist merely to wow audiences with effects and set-piece or bombard them with zinging one-liners (both of which are present, of course), but Singer also wants to elicit an emotional response form his viewers, and he succeeds. Although Singer perhaps crams too many characters into a film with such a short runtime (which leaves the movie a bit top-heavy), he has effectively laid the groundwork for a likable assortment of characters. This is also aided, of course, by the terrific cast that Singer has tapped.The real casting ace is then-unknown Australian actor Hugh Jackman, who delivers a fierce and emotive performance that justifiably turned him into a major Hollywood star. When asked if his metallic claws hurt when they tear through the knuckles of his hands, Jackman replies, 'Every time,' and his somber delivery perfectly captures all of the physical and psychological pain that comes from being different. Singer also pulls memorable work from Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, although it must be pointed out that both Anna Paquin and Halle Berry are terrible, inflicting completely unlistenable attempts at character accents upon us. The film has so many characters and set-ups that the whole picture is a bit top-heavy, however, X-MEN is still one of the few film blockbusters of the 21st century to dig below surface-level aesthetics, and it proved that audiences still respond to heroes at the box office.",8,0,0,28 July 2006
The Terminator," Genre-defining classic
","Made on a relatively low budget, James Cameron's now-seminal sci-fi/action thriller should be considered a model of efficient film-making. Cameron and his fellow artisans managed to create a tightly-constructed and imaginative film under considerably meager constraints, and yet the finished film remains highly impressive even when viewed some 20 odd years later. Aside from a few shoddily obvious rear projection shots, the special effects are still realistic and credible, and much of the f/x makeup and prosthetic work remain seamless. Yet, as impressive as the film's technical merits may be, it is the sensitive and surprisingly effective storyline that has propelled this film to the status of modern classic.A creative blend of time-travel science fiction, heart-pounding action, and organic, non-cloying romance, THE TERMINATOR manages to hit all of the right notes without ever condescending to the obvious nor feeling constrained and stilted. Playing the title role elevated Austrian actor/bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger into Hollywood's A-list virtually overnight, and the monosyllabic, impossibly built cyborg is still probably the best use of Schwarzenegger's steely screen presence. Linda Hamilton is likable and sympathetic as Schwarzenegger's intended victim, and Michael Biehn is terrific as a weary professional soldier. Although I also liked the high-octane, effects-heavy, multi-million dollar sequel, the comparatively low tech original remains a creative and highly influential watershed moment for the genre.",8,0,1,28 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Solid conclusion to the ultimate Sci-Fi trilogy (with a couple of missteps)
","The conclusion to the original STAR WARS trilogy remains a great deal of fun, even if it lacks the breathtaking, genre-defining enthusiasm of the first picture and the searing, mature nature of the second. For the second time in a role, George Lucas returns as the film's screenwriter and producer, but turns the directorial duties over to another film-maker - this time Englishman Richard Marquand (who's most notable film up to that date had been 1978's lackluster THE LEGACY). While he lacks the thunderous cliffhanger charm and the somber literate quality that Lucas and Irvin Kershner respectively brought to the previous installments, Marquand proves to be quite proficient in the director's chair. Although the film doesn't re-imagine (or even revitalize) the genre the way the previous films did, it still proves to be a great space opera with plenty of highly memorable scenes and set pieces.The opening sequences of the film are exhilarating, with Leia's attempted rescue of Han and Luke's battle against an imposing rock-like monster both emerging as perfectly executed scenes of action and suspense. The film also contains the typically impressive array of special effects, including a taunt forest chase scene on airborne spacecrafts that expertly merges stop motion effects, miniature models, and green screen footage into one seamless sequence of adrenaline-pumping action. All of the regular cast members return (in one form or another), and all of the respective actors display an ever-increasing confidence in their characterizations (which is the third such go-around for most of them). The film's storyline also retains some of EMPIRE'S adult-oriented pathos, especially in the Emperor's repeated attempts to draw Luke towards the dark side.Unfortunately, the film also contains many portions that seem to be trying much too hard to play out to the children in the audience, especially the woefully-misplaced cuteness of the cuddly Ewoks and even in Darth Vader's overly sentimental last-minute 'change of heart' (which, in addition to being too schmaltzy, stretches credibility far too much). I was also disappointed by the off-handed treatment given to the characters that were introduced with great importance in EMPIRE; Yoda and Boba Fett are quickly killed off with an almost casual indifference, and Lando Calrissian is sidelined early and nearly forgotten about until the end of the film. Worse still is the fact the climax of the film basically rehashes the climaxes of the previous films, and with less success. This is easily the biggest problem in the film (and could have easily been fixed with a little more creative writing), but the film recovers and ends with a pleasing coda that brings the trilogy to a satisfying close.Even with it's flaws, RETURN OF THE JEDI remains a great sci-fi adventure that will most surely be enjoyed by fans of the genre. Although I'm convinced that it could have been even better, it's shortcomings are only apparent when compared to the pristine quality of the previous two films and it is a terrific ride when taken on it's own terms. Try to avoid the 2004 though, which adds an obnoxious musical number to the opening sequence, inserts some poorly-done CGI in several other scenes, and unforgivably replaces Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen in the finale - a disastrous move that zaps nearly every ounce of poignancy out of the aforementioned coda sequence. I know that Lucas tampered with the other two films as well, but the most obtrusive changes occur here, so track down a copy of 1983 original if at all possible.",6,1,4,1 June 2006
Alien," Justifiably considered a classic
","Director Ridley Scott's entry in the post-STAR WARS science fiction boom, the box office smash ALIEN ended up carving it's own niche in the genre and became a certifiable film classic in it's right. The film's plot is nothing new or revolutionary in and of it's self (the crew of a spacecraft is trapped onboard with a carnivorous alien who picks them off one by one), but Scott and screenwriter Dan O'Bannon wisely downplay the typical genre gimmickry in favor of a deceptively straightforward narrative. In fact, the film actually plays more like a psychological cat-and-mouse thriller than a routine space adventure, although the spacecraft setting lends the suspense a brilliantly claustrophobic atmosphere that possibly could not have been duplicated with an earth-bound setting. As the infamous tagline reads, 'In space no one can hear you scream.' The film is benefited greatly from the exceptional art and set decoration, which is overflowing with rich detail and great imagination. During every scene, every shot, and every frame, the viewer is never less than totally convinced that they are in a lone spacecraft floating through the solar system. The Oscar-winning special effects remain highly convincing, including believable space travel and a highly memorable 'birth' scene for the titular creature. The creature itself is marvelously designed, and Scott wisely keeps the alien hidden in the shadows for the majority of the film, therefore increasing the atmosphere and building suspense to an almost unbearable degree as the fear of the unknown intensifies.The cast of characters includes an interesting assortment of tired working stiffs and various other misfits - none of these individuals are the virtuous heroes that plague most science fiction films, in fact most of them are simple space age truckers - this assignment isn't a mission to them, it's just a job. The cast is flawlessly chosen down to the letter, with Tom Skerritt, Yaphet Kotto, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, and especially Ian Holm (in a extremely chilling performance) all completely believable in their respective roles. Best of all is then-newcomer Sigourney Weaver, in a towering performance of strength and intelligence that is rare in this genre's typical characterization of women. Not only did Weaver's exceptional performance make the actress an overnight star, it also single-handedly defined the female action heroine for the post-modern era.",9,0,1,25 May 2006
Malcolm X," Lee's best film, and one of the greatest bio-pics ever
","Spike Lee's films typically leave me cold. There are usually some very powerful scenes and a lot of important questions thrown around, but his films seldom add up to a satisfying whole. MALCOLM X is a big exception to this statement. Intelligent, though provoking, and (perhaps most shockingly) very entertaining, the film is structurally and dramatically cohesive as well. The film's pace is also perfect; never too rushed, nor too slow, even at the three-hour runtime.Denzel Washington gives one of the most layered and complex performances in cinematic history. This is the film he should have won an Oscar for, and a darn shame he didn't. Angela Bassett also should have received some academy attention (she failed to snag a Best Supporting Actress Nod), for she is vibrant and moving in what could have been a relatively thankless part. A superbly crafted and important historical film, MALCOLM X is one of those movies that every American should see.",10,4,11,30 April 2006
Taxi Driver," Post-modern masterpiece
","The very embodiment of a post-modern masterpiece, director Martin Scorsese's gritty hymn to big city desperation remains one of the most haunting films ever made. Robert De Niro is outstanding as the titular anti-hero. Driven to insanity by the rejection of the unobtainably beautiful Cybill Shepherd, and intent on saving child prostitute Jodie Foster, De Niro's mentally unstable Travis Bickle is the exact type of morally ambiguous character that becomes an insane murderer to some and a martyred hero to others. It is a difficult and risky maneuver to ask audiences to enter into the world of such an individual, but De Niro and Scorsese never make a single wrong turn in their attempt to provide an understanding, nonjudgmental view of such madness.The film is intentionally filmed in very grainy, muted colors with relatively poor definition and contrast, which perfectly suits the film's uneasy subject matter. The atmosphere is so vivid, you'll swear you can smell the stench of the back alley garbage piles and the odor of freshly spray-painted graffiti. And De Niro's towering performance is far from the only standout in the cast, with Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle, and Harvey Keitel all turning terrific work. This particularly true of Jodie Foster, who, at the right old age of 14, gives a performance of startling maturity and unsettling weariness.",10,0,0,4 May 2006
North by Northwest," It's impossible to praise this film too much
","Arguably director Alfred Hitchcock's best-loved film, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is an insanely skillful blend of action, romance, comedy, and intrigue that never feels contrived or strained. The film was almost instantly embraced by critics and audiences as a film masterpiece, and it has since only grown in reputation as one of the all-time great films of any era. Amazingly, this is certainly one case where such high ended praise is completely deserved, and, in fact, this is one of those rare films that have been heralded as a 'classic' for decades that truly meets such impossibly high expectations. As a matter of fact, it very well may be impossible to say too many good things about this picture.Alfred Hitchcock is always a director that typically placed technical film craft over the importance of such necessary dramatic devices such as plausible plot twists and significant character development. As a matter of fact, the 1946 film Notorious (which gets my vote as the master's best film) is probably the only truly character-driven film of his career. However, the artificiality of the plot and strictly two-dimensional nature of the character is absolutely not a problem in this film, and may even be one of its strongest assets. This is because NORTH BY NORTHWEST, as with Hitchcock's 1955 picture TO CATCH A THIEF, is a total farce from beginning to end, and typically strong storytelling elements such as a clear narrative and believable characters would have only bloated the picture.Further cementing the film's status as an unquestioned masterwork is the jaw-dropping number of eye-catching set pieces that retain in the memory even years after the picture has ended, yet somehow manage to gel into a coherent whole. Hitchcock was in the absolute peak of his technical prowess here, and each and every scene plays out with the seemingly impossible professionalism that only a truly skilled and inventive filmmaker can achieve. Sure, the now-landmark crop duster scene and the Mt. Rushmore finale are now as permanently etched in the public's collective conscious as the Nation Anthem, but virtually any other scene in the film (no matter how minor it's significance) is nearly as stunning. And Hitchcock also pulls memorable performances from Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, Phillip Ober, and Martin Landau ¬ñ all whom are perfectly cast and play their intentionally thin roles with an alarming exactness.Yet even more than Hitchcock's film-making mastery, the real reason the film is an absolute gem from beginning to end is none other than Cary Grant. At age 55 and still unnervingly handsome, Grant is perhaps Hitchcock's perfect on-screen hero as he jump-starts even the most under-developed roles with magnetic charisma, dapper humor, and an disarming sex appeal that remains absolutely effortless even in his third decade as actor. The film basically calls upon Grant to venture into practically ever screen personae that he had personified up to that time, and the dashing actor impressively never misses a beat. Although NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a film that has completely earned the title of masterpiece for many reasons, watching one of the silver screen's ultimate stars work his uncompromised magic is reason enough to hold it in high esteem.",10,0,0,28 July 2006
Dreamgirls," Superficial, but entertaining
","Possibly the most anticipated (or at least the most hyped) film of 2006, DREAMGIRLS is a fictional account of the rise and fall of a Supremes-like singing group. The original play, as staged by Michael Bennett, opened on Broadway in 1981 and was an immediate success. Not only did the play run for many performances, but it won six Tony awards and a Grammy, and also made actress/singer Jennifer Holiday a star. Plans for a film adaptation languished in development hell for 25 years until respected director/screenwriter Bill Condon pushed the long-awaited film into production.As with any film that is so eager anticipated, expectations were very high for DREAMGIRLS, which ended up receiving relatively strong reviews and won nearly every conceivable 'supporting actress' award for Jennifer Hudson. I personally found the film to be enjoyable, but not the great masterpiece that Paramount seemed to believe it is. Basically, the film is slick and extremely well-made on the surface, but offers no real insight or uniqueness to its routine plot line. The film relies far too often on the mechanisms of the predictable plot rather than allowing us to experience the joy and pain of its characters, which would have led to a truly rewarding experience.That's not to say that the film isn't entertaining while it's playing, because it certainly is. As paint-by-the-numbers as the film may be, it makes up for what it lacks in character and genuineness with style and flare. The film is a splashy musical of the type that is rarely seen, and it zips along at a breakneck speed that equates to a surprisingly brisk pace for a movie that runs 131 minutes long. The audience is always two steps ahead of the picture, but it is so buoyant with energy that no one will mind.The performers all do a capable job with the familiar material. I thought that Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles were good in their respective roles ¬ñ even though I found their characters unconvincing in the end (Foxx's Berry Gordy-like mogul becomes a one-dimensional villain in the film's final third, while Beyonce's Deena never once displays any Diana Ross-like arrogance and is unconvincingly portrayed as a virtual saint). The film really draws its strength from terrific supporting performances from Eddie Murphy, Anika Noni Rose, Danny Glover, Keith Robinson, and especially the stunning Jennifer Hudson. Miracle of miracles, newcomer Hudson is every bit as sensational as the buzz indicated, and she truly is a knockout! I never saw the play in any of its incarnations, so this film was my first true exposure to material. Overall, I found the much-praised songs by Henry Krieger and the late Tom Eyen to be only average (there are also four newly-written songs by Krieger and various other writers). I enjoyed the several Motown sound-a-likes (especially 'Move' and the instantly memorable title song), but I found many of the more dramatic pieces to be fairly tuneless and rambling. The highpoints are easily Hudson two big solos ('And I'm Telling You I am not Going,' and 'I am Changing'), both of which are sold by the conviction and intensity of Hudson's performance.In summary, I found DREAMGIRLS to be appealing and entertaining, yet I could help but wish that director Condone had infused the film with just a fraction of the depth he gave his own 1998 James Whale biopic GODS AND MONSTERS. With just a little more insight or more detailed characterizations, the film could have been a truly great picture. As is, the film solidly enjoyable, and certainly as well produced as any film recent memory. DREAMGIRLS may ultimately be empty inside, but it sure is a pretty package!",6,0,0,6 February 2008
Aliens," Effective combination of SCI-FI and action
","Director James Cameron's follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi classic ALIEN wisely avoids the potentially fatal error of attempting to recreate the original film's style and structure, and successfully strives for something completely different. Instead of a brooding, space-age horror movie like the first film, ALIENS actually plays like a war movie in space. The emphasis is more on action than terror, and this new direction works surprisingly well even if Cameron's clunky dialogue often thuds. While it may lack the much of the haunting aura and 'art house' inventiveness of the first film, ALIENS delivers on all accounts when it comes to breathtaking action and suspense.In an Oscar-nominated performance, Sigourney Weaver is absolutely sensational as the returning Lt. Ripley. Although some may complain that Weaver's RAMBO-esquire physical feats are nothing more than the continued macho-ization of women (and they would have a valid point), I defy anyone who questions the credibility of this actress' commanding performance. I typically loath it when films of this genre attempt to incorporate 'cute' kids into the action, and nine-year-old Carrie Henn is a bit too sticky sweet for my taste, although her presence in the film does eventually provide a satisfying emotional playoff. The remainder of the cast includes a likeably varied group of put-on heroes, with Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstein all turning in memorable portrayals.In 1991, Cameron released his 'Director's Cut' of the film, which over 17 minutes of previously cut footage. Most of the film's fans consider this extended cut to be the definitive version of the film, yet I personally have some reservations about some of the re-added scenes. While the many moments of character development (like Ripley adjusting to the fact that so much time has passed since her previous adventure, and a surprisingly moving moment when Hicks and Ripley exchange first names) are terrific (and probably should have never been cut), but the scene where Newt's family discovers the aliens was better left to the imagination. I personally feel that the original theatrical cut should be watched first, but, either way, ALIENS remains one the finest sci-fi actioners.",7,0,0,25 May 2006
Meet the Fockers," Terrific cast makes this picture fun!
","This sequel to the hit comedy MEET THE PARENTS exceeded everyone's wildest expectations when it grossed nearly $280 million at the US box office, and became the highest grossing live action comedy of all time. Although audiences seemed to love this lowbrow culture clash comedy, most film critics were seemingly merciless in their hatred of the film. In the end, the film is solidly enjoyable, and perhaps is even superior to the somewhat one-note original film. The picture ends up delivering more or less what it promises, so it's difficult to fathom exactly what type of movie that most critics and naysayers were expecting.The likable Ben Stiller had been on a hot streak of successful films for a good five years or so before the release of FOCKERS, and he has emerged into a remarkably good straight man - managing to find laughs without pushing too hard. Robert De Niro, unarguably one the screen's finest dramatic actors of all-time, has staged an amazing third-quarter career revival as a comedic actor in the last few years, and he has never appeared more comfortable playing comedic aggression as he does here. The film's major casting ace, however, is the dynamic one-two punch of Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Stiller's free-wheeling parents. Hoffman and Streisand literally radiate with an irresistibly genuine warmth and a combustible comedic energy that completely steals every scene in which they appear; if there is to be a third FOCKER film, I hope that Hoffman and Streisand are given the starring roles!If the film has a downside, it is certainly the often ho-hum nature of the script, which somehow manages to be somewhat unfocused and completely predictable at the same time. Also, I do wish that the film-makers had given the lovely Blythe Danner and Teri Polo more to do this time around, as they often seem heavily underutilized in the presence of heavy weights like De Niro, Hoffman, and Streisand. The film succeeds, however, thanks to it's ensemble of extremely likable character and it's powerhouse cast that overcomes even the most well-worn screenplay. While it will never be a critical favorite, MEET THE FOCKERS is an amusing, sometimes hilarious, farce that is much better than many of the so-called 'comedies' of the last few years.",6,0,0,20 April 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," Landmark cinema
","With 2001, legendary film director Stanley Kubrick managed to craft a visual tone poem on the screen with little regard for usual film-making conventions like a detailed plot of fully-developed characters. The film is a total visceral experience, and is a motion picture that demands full submission on the part of the viewer. This film will not meet the audience half-way, and it demands that viewers totally shut off their logic and become wrapped up in tone and atmosphere. If a viewer is unwilling or unable to let go of their conscious thoughts in such a manner, then 2001 may prove to be a disappointing and frustrating experience.The storyline, as it is, is about the divisions among man and animal, and it poses the question of what will happen if technology is the next step in the evolutionary ladder of intelligence. The theme of the film is not defined so much in terms of dialogue, however, as much as it is in visual representation and aura. The film is awash with stunning set pieces and visual effects, many of which remain much more effective than the hastily-done, two-dimensional CGI effects of today. No other film has ever made the thought of drifting into orbit look and feel more beautiful than 2001, which makes the danger that emerges in the films final third even more effectively jarring.The film really challenges the viewer in its final minutes when it makes the sudden switch from expertly-crafted space adventure and into the realm of metaphysical spiritual commentary. This maneuver is both very bold and audacious, but it comes together flawlessly as the picture builds to a spin-tingling denouncement. It is the relative scientific accuracy of the bulk of the film that this last great leap into the unknown so disorienting, but this is precisely what leaves the non-analytical viewer grappling with such deep issues and self-reflection. In the end, 2001 is as much a full-fledged experience as it is a film, which something that all great art strives to achieve.Incredibly, given it's nearly art house pedigree, 2001 proved to be a major success with mainstream film audiences. The year of 1968 was a competitive year in Hollywood with ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968), BULLITT (1968), ROMEO AND JUILET (1968) and another sci-fi blockbuster PLANET OF THE APES (1968) all vying for dominance at the box office. Impressively, 2001 ended up becoming the second-highest grossing film of the year (the smash musical FUNNY GIRL was the year's top grosser, by the way), earning an estimated $56 million in the US alone (a huge sum in the late-sixties). This is at least one example where a complex, intelligent film did not go unnoticed by the mainstream public at the time of its release.",10,0,2,25 May 2006
Rocky," The original still packs a mean punch
","I cannot tell you how many people make fun of me for loving this movie. Never mind the fact that it was the top grossing film of 1976, and won a whole slew of industry awards, including the highly coveted Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. Perhaps it is the eventual deterioration of Sylvester Stallone's career (I still sympathize with the mental anguish that anyone who saw 1995's JUDGE DREAD in it's entirety suffered), or maybe it's the endless series of glitzy sequels and imitations that the film inspired (which did become numbing), but, for whatever reason, the reputation of this film seemed to get permanently soiled along the way. This is a shame, because ROCKY remains possibly the best underdog romance ever.After years of glossy sequels, it's a bit amazing in retrospect how grim and downtrodden much of the film feels. There is a moving aura of sadness and desperation that hangs over the majority of the film's characters, as if they all realize that they have wasted much of lives and are running out of time. Though he has (perhaps deservedly) become the butt of hundreds of jokes over the years, Sylvester Stallone (who also penned the film's screenplay) has undeniable charisma and displays mega-watt star power in this picture. Many people may forget this now, but many respected film critics actually compared Stallone to a young Marlon Brando when the film originally opened, and that high form of praise is rarely dispensed if undeserved.The remainder of the cast is similarly winning, particularly the quiet strength of Talia Shire, long before she became a punch-line on the sitcom 'Friends.' So many film romances have used the tired plot device of the ugly ducking who becomes beautiful by the film's finale, but Shire truly does make the transition from a put-on wallflower to a beauty right in front of our very eyes. Her transformation is so truly convincing that it makes the clich√© seem fresh. The sister of director Francis Ford Coppola, Shire still acts today (most in bit and supporting parts) with considerable regularity, but I would love to see her tackle another lead role again in the future.Inspired by Mohamad Ali, Carl Weather's Apollo Creed is appropriately energetic and arrogant, while Burt Young's despicable leach of a brother is so unsympathetic that you actually start to like him about halfway through the film. Best of all is Burgess Meredith, whose short-tempered trainer could have ventured into unbearable campiness, but Meredith's fiery hostility is interlaced with considerable nuance. All these individuals seem less like film characters and more like real people, a feeling that is enhanced by the pseudo-docudrama style in which John G. Avildsen directs. And that, in and of it's self, is a far cry from all the glossy sequels that followed.",8,3,5,4 May 2006
Pretty Woman," Roberts is terrific in this fun variation on PYGMALION
","In the film that made her an international superstar overnight, Julia Roberts is funny, charming, gorgeous, lovable, poised, and tons of other terrific adjectives. Just like Katharine Hepburn in the forties and Barbra Streisand in seventies, Roberts managed to take her own weaknesses (in her case, her large mouth, pointy eyes, huge teeth, and clumsy demeanor) and turn them into assets. In PRETTY WOMAN, Roberts made being good-naturedly gawky look chic and sexy. Anyone who still wonders why this woman became the top box office star of the nineties needs to re-watch this film again.As for the film's story, it's basically yet another variation on PYGMALION/MY FAIR LADY, but it is totally energized by Robert's fresh and incandescent presence. Richard Gere is fine but a little on the stoic side as Roberts' modern-day Henry Higgins (I couldn't help but wish he would have displayed some more of his trademark intensity), but Laura San Giacomo and Hector Elizondo shine in memorable supporting roles. Best of all is veteran screen star Ralph Bellamy (THE AWFUL TRUTH, HIS GIRL Friday) who (at age 86) is funny and touching as Gere's business nemesis/father figure. Deftly directed by audience-pleaser Garry Marshal, PRETTY WOMAN is a must for individuals who like the romance emphasized in their romantic comedies.",8,0,1,4 May 2006
Die Hard," Action classic
","Hands down, one of the most influential contemporary action films of it's era, DIE HARD is a white-knuckle thrill ride that almost single-handedly redefined the genre and inspired a whole slew of imitators and sequels ‚Äì none of which can even close to matching the impact of the original. The film also sent star Bruce Willis into the stratosphere of success, which had both positive and negative ramifications. One of the main reasons that Willis is so effective in this film is because he represents an action hero who is also very much an everyman, a quality that has been diminished since Willis was catapulted to Hollywood's A-list. While I find much of his subsequent performances to be cloying and self-congratulatory, there is no denying that Willis is absolutely perfect here as DIE HARD'S brittle, wisecracking protagonist.Jeb Stuart's screenplay is brilliant in it's fundamental simplicity, and Stuart's dialogue impressively manages to remain witty without crossing the line into unbearable camp. Director John McTiernan wisely does not attempt to elaborate on simple premise of Roderick Thorp's original novel, yet he does manage to effectively pull out every stop and maintain a fever-pitch of intensity throughout the entire proceedings. In addition to delivering the aforementioned career-best performance from Willis, McTiernan also gets solid work from Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman, who proves true the old clich√© that a thrill-inducing action yarn is only as good as it's villain. A towering, suspenseful, humorous, and exhilarating picture, DIE HARD is unquestionably a significant benchmark for the action genre.",8,2,3,28 July 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Foster, Hopkins, and the film itself are all great
","This is another film in which so many aspects of it have been written, critiqued, and analyzed that I seriously wonder why I am even bother writing a review of it. Based on the best-selling novel by Thomas Harris, LAMBS is film that manages to successfully play to both cerebral and visceral senses without slighting one for the other. In other words, those looking for an intelligent psychological thriller will be rewarded with an articulate script and strong performances, while slasher fans will reveal in such genre staples as a transvestite killer who skins bodies. Jonathan Demme's taunt direction ties all the elements together flawlessly, and delivers outstanding performances from his stars.Jodie Foster brings her innate intelligence and charming naivet√É¬© to her role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, and she should receive major kudos for portraying her character's strength as stemming from her brain rather than any pumped-up Sigourney Weaver-esquire physical prowess. Anthony Hopkins also delivers a tremendous performance that and belies his relatively brief screen time with immense effectiveness. He is so menacing that it feels like he's everywhere, even though he is only on-screen for roughly one-fourth of the picture. Scott Glenn and Kasi Lemmons are fine, but underused - this is the Foster and Hopkins show all the way! The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were certainly fans of the film, as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS swept the Academy Awards, deservedly winning Oscars in all five major categories. This was only the third film in history to do so.A perfect motion picture.",8,1,1,4 May 2006
Blade Runner," Stunning futuristic film noir
","As if directing one genre-defining science fiction film with 1979's ALIEN was not enough, director Ridley Scott returned to the genre a scant three years later and crafted another sci-fi classic that is completely different from that earlier film. Whereas ALIEN was a totally visceral thrill ride, BLADE RUNNER is a much more subdued, cerebral offering. Nominally based on Phillip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, BLADE RUNNER is perhaps best described as futuristic film noir. Although the film is set in the year 2019, and features a vast array of technical marvels, the film's depiction of Los Angels is not drastically different than the world of today, at least in terms of the humanoids that inhabit it.The cast is a seemingly odd assortment of actors, but they come together as a surprisingly effective ensemble. Harrison Ford was born to be a sci-fi film star as his aloof, tough guy personae never caves under the extravagance of massive production design or heavy special effects. Rutger Hauer and Sean Young give haunting, compelling performances as two replicants who want more, and William Sanderson turns in an endearing portrayal of a perpetual child of sorts. Edward James Olmos, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, and then-newcomer Daryl Hannah all deliver striking supporting performances that linger on in the memory of the viewer long after the film has ended.Although justifiably considered a film classic today, BLADE RUNNER was surprisingly a box office failure at the time of its release, seemingly misunderstood by an audience who were expecting the more straightforward thrills and chills of Scott's ALIEN. It seems as if the majority of the film-going public simply was not ready for a sci-fi adventure that was as literate and thought-provoking as this film. Artistic justice was served in 1992 when Warner Brothers allowed Scott to release a 'Director's Cut' version of BLADE RUNNER, which presents the film in the manner in which Scott originally intended it to be released. The 'Director's Cut' wisely drops the studio-mandated narration and the tacked-on 'happy' ending, and was almost immediately embraced as further improvement on this classic film by the majority of viewers.",9,0,0,25 May 2006
X2: X-Men United," Perhaps the best superhero movie of the decade
","Not only is X2 a rare sequel that manages to top the original film that it was spun off from, but it also emerges as one of the best superhero movies ever made. Director Bryan Singer and his small army of screenwriters have fashioned an impossibly tight little film that grabs you right from the beginning and refuses to let go. Inventively and successfully merging the expected superhero elements with a finely tuned story of political intrigue and unholy alliances, X2 also provides popcorn audience with plenty of marvelous action set-pieces and top-drawer special effects. As with the first film, X2 is definitely character-driven, but unlike the first film (which admittedly felt a little rushed) Singer takes his time here and gives everyone something interesting to do.Once again, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen really make the picture with sharply-defined, fully-realized portrayals that always feel real and genuine, although the brilliant performance of newcomer Alan Cumming is just as impressive. Brian Cox and Kelly Hu make memorable villains, and X2 also gives the striking Rebecca Romijn and the always-underrated Famke Janssen more screen-time, the latter of which manages to quite nearly steal the show in a surprising moving climax. As with any movie that features so many characters, not everyone is going to be featured as prominently, and, as a result, the screen-time of Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, and James Marsden is rather limited √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú but they all have strong moments and together form a terrific ensemble. Exciting, entertaining, and though-provoking, X2 is top notch action.",9,0,0,28 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The film that changed Hollywood (for better or worse); still amazing
","Yes, the original can still stand head and shoulders above the competition. One of the all-time biggest box office titans, the first film in the original STAR WARS trilogy is a 24-karat film classic in the same vein of such cinematic masterpieces as The WIZARD OF OZ (1939) and CASABLANCE (1942). Even the decades of sequels, lame knock-offs, and crass commercial tie-ins cannot dim the sheer brilliance of the ultimate space opera. When re-watching the film all these years later, it remains impossible not to get caught up once again in the film's irresistible sense of adventure and excitement.Much of what makes the film special (and what director/writer seems to have forgotten when creating his uneven prequel trilogy in the late-nineties/early-2000's) is the relative simplicity of the entire project. This is not to deny the various technical merits of the film, as Lucas is a true pioneer in large-scale effects-heavy film-making. The still-impressive special effects designed by Jonh Dysktra and John Stears set a new standard for film visual effects, and the production design and Rick Baker's make-up effects are top-notch without being overdone. Impressive as the film's technical merits remain, however, the film's true heart lies in good old fashioned story-telling.In the end, STAR WARS excels as entertainment simply because it is a great story told in an fresh and inventive manner. The characters have all justifiably become pop culture icons, especially Mark Hamill's quintessential put-on hero Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford's quick-witted pilot Han Solo, and everyone's favorite bickering robots, C-P3O and R2-D2. The perfect amount of sophistication is brought to the proceedings by screen legend Alec Guinness, who delivers a performance of great nuance and indisputable class. Best of all is the infamous Darth Vader (sinisterly voiced by James Earl Jones), who remains one of the silver screen's greatest villains.",8,1,1,25 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the trilogy; an awesome space adventure!
","One of the rare sequels that arguably tops it's own classic predecessor, the second film in the original STAR WARS trilogy manages to seamlessly combine the cliffhanger thrills and good-natured humor of the original with a darker and more adult-oriented storyline. Producer/writer George Lucas (who also directed the first film) decided to pass the directorial duties over to semi-avant guard director Irvin Kershner (best known at the time for 1970's LOVING and 1972's UP THE SANDBOX), which proved to be an ingenious move. Kershner's dramatic background serves him well in helming the complex plot, and he pulls fully-rounded characterizations from the entire cast. The merging of Kershner's storytelling talents with Lucas' mastery of the film-making technique is the very heart of this, which is arguably the greatest space adventure ever.The film works in numerous ways. Scene-by-scene, the film continually tops itself with one startling set piece after another, yet the picture also gels perfectly together as cohesive roller-coaster ride of suspense, romance, and still-dazzling special effects - with even some philosophy effectively thrown into the mix. Many of the series most intriguing characters are introduced in this installment, including space-age playboy Lando Carlissian (charismatically played by Billy Dee Williams), ruthless bounty hunter Boba Fett (an unrecognizable Jeremy Bulloch), and especially the ultimate mystic Yoda (flawlessly voiced by Frank Oz). The notorious Emperor (voiced by the sinister Clive Revill) also makes a brief-but-memorable appearance that initiates an intriguing set up for the following film.The new cast of characters are seamlessly woven into the saga's vast tapestry, and perfectly compliment the returning cast members, most of whom are at their best in this film. Mark Hamill's seemingly perpetual man/child Luke Skywalker actually does an impressive deal of growing up in this installment, and the deeper characterization suits the winsome actor well. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are given a genuinely believable romantic subplot that never feels contrived or tacked on, and C-3PO (the delightful English actor Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 once again steal nearly every scene they appear in as the series' sparring robots. And this is to say nothing of Darth Vader's (once again eerily voiced by James Earl Jones) shocking revelation to Luke during the film's bravura climax, which is a plot twist that packed a major wallop back in 1980 and is still somewhat startling even today.",10,0,1,25 May 2006
The Wizard of Oz," A true cinematic milestone
","Where to begin? MGM's elaborate adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ not only became an institution among itself (and practically defined the concept of modern popular culture), but is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film, and director Victor Fleming (along with countless other behind-the-scenes technicians) craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects (the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI), witty dialogue, and eye-popping Technicolor, THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a once-in-a-lifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.The cast could not be improved upon. The quivery-voiced, solemn-faced Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, the little lost farm girl on the road to Oz, clutching her beloved Toto (impressively portrayed himself by the female canine performer Terry, the terrier). It seems inconceivable that MGM had originally wished to cast Shirley Temple in the role, as Temple's doe-eyed, cutesy-voiced shtick would have been a catastrophic ill-fit for the tone of this picture. Conversely, Garland is perhaps the screen's quintessential woman/child; always seemingly just one step away from reaching full emotional maturity. It is her sadness that transfixes viewers to the screen, the exact same quality that made the film's most memorable Harold Arlen/E. Y. Harburg number 'Over the Rainbow' into one of the most exquisite marriages between artist and song ever to be recorded.The remainder of the cast is similarly exceptional, many of whom perform perfectly even under the most debilitating make-up and costumes. Frank Morgan is marvelously versatile in no less than five roles, the insanely energetic Bert Lahr mugs brilliantly, the handsome Jack Haley swoons sweetly, Billie Burke lends the film an ornate ethereality, and Ray Bolger's gravity-defying physical presence nearly steals the entire picture on several occasions. Perhaps most notable is former schoolteacher Margaret Hamilton's transformation into the wickedest of wicked witches, which certainly remains among the vilest and most terrifying portrayals of full-throttle evil ever to be seen. No matter how it is analyzed, scrutinized, or satirized, the 1939 production of THE WIZARD OF OZ is a top-notch example of how to turn a great story into a fabulous, milestone of a film.",10,103,119,7 May 2006
