Miracle," Awesome
","I just got home from watching the sneak preview and it was excellent.  The acting was surprisingly solid, and the movie was put together very well. It was a blast.  From a hockey fan's point of view, I wish they would have shown their final game against finland, but I understand why they didn't. The movie was very cool and I can't wait for it to come out on dvd.  I may need to see it again in theaters!",9,0,0,31 January 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Simply great.
","I went to see this movie on Christmas (what do you expect I'm Jewish lol) and I was shocked at how good it was.  I'm a pretty big Dicaprio fan from 'Basketball Diaries' and 'Romeo and Juliet' but I had just seen 'Gangs of New York,' and frankly I wasn't ready to forget that horribly overrated bloodbath.  I am now!  Leo was just great!  He was everything: he was smart, funny, cool and slick.  I don't think they could have picked anyone better to play his part.  Of course, Tom Hanks was great too, but that goes without saying.",9,1,1,29 December 2002
The Matrix," Garbage
","Why does everyone love these movies?  They are junk.  The story is none existent and full of rhetorical nonsense that's randomly placed and stolen from philosophers, the acting is pathetic, and I still believe the only reason people like this movie is because they are hypnotized by its 'dazzling' special effects.  People consider these ground-breaking special effects...no.  Star Wars was ground-breaking, The Matrix is just people fighting for no reason other than to show off their 'great' CGI.  I sure hope they don't decide to make a 4th. 3/10 stars.",3,6,13,6 January 2004
