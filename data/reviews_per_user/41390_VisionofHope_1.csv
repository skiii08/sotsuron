Despicable Me 2," Better than the original!
","It's not often that a hit animated film's sequel surpasses the original film. Despicable Me 2 is one of those rare cases. From the moment it appears on the screen to the end of the film, Despicable Me 2 is a fast paced, fun film that never ceases to be entertaining.This film has you laughing quite often, contains humour that both kids and adults can appreciate, and had at least one moment that was worthy of clapping out loud to.The character development is to be praised, as is the warmth and soul that Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud put into this film.This film leaves you feeling joyful and satisfied and happy for the characters and the new direction their lives are taking.This film is not to be missed and I can't recommend it enough.",8,100,167,21 June 2013
