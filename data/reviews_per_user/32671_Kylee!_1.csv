Antz," A few redeeming factors, but not many
","Hated it.That said, it had its good points. Christopher Walken was really great. The animation was splendidly realistic, even if they did choose a very creepy head shape for the worker ants. And, well, that's about all I liked about it.In my opinion, animation should be used when you're doing something that can't be done as well any other way. The feeling and plot of this movie could have been portrayed better with human characters. See A Bug's Life for an example of how to animate whimsy; see Prince of Egypt for how to animate brightness and wonder; especially see Kiki's Delivery Service for how to animate sheer charm. This had nothing that couldn't have been done better another way; it's animation for the sake of showing people how powerful your 3D rendering computer is.And Woody Allen? For goodness sake.",Null,0,0,30 December 1998
