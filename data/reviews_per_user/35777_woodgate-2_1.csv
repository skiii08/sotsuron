Walk the Line," Fantastic story - but I wanted more.
","I loved the movie and could not wait to get to the store to purchase the soundtrack, which is great to listen to! Phoenix and Witherspoon did outstanding portrayals as Johnny and June! They were very believable as the Cash's. Being a fan of The Man in Black, I saw many of his expressions and looks in Phoenix. I had always heard stories about Johnny's rough beginnings, but this movie explained so much to me. The only disappointment in the entire production was that it ended so abruptly. I wanted to see more, more, more. Maybe there will be a sequel? This movie and the stars certainly are in line for many awards. Again, they only improvement I could see is to continue it on through their marriage and careers.",10,0,0,8 January 2006
