Blade Runner 2049," very bland and slow
","It's a very boring and slow movie. Ryan Gosling was chosen for the part because he was particularly slow in the slowest parts of the 'Drive' movie.
The film was so slow and disappointing that I had to watch it in two sessions. It has lost the magic of the first film, where a new world was created; this movie only shows some slight elaborations of tired tv tropes. It's so slow that you're always ahead of what happens next.",6,5,8,4 February 2019
Her," really terrible
","I was intrigued to see this film, the plot seemed to be unique and interesting. But after about ten minutes of viewing, I can assure you that there are no more surprises, nothing exciting, and the show continues until the predictable and unexciting end. I'm offended by the fact that this film has scored so high. The only explanation is that the lower grades are not counted for some strange problem with the IMDb algorithm. Other big problems of the movie? The pants worn by the actors. The fact that the main actor burned his brain with drugs. I would not recommend seeing this movie. If you just decide to watch it, I recommend you see this film alone, with no one next to it. This way you can go ahead jumping ten minutes at a time and concluding this terrible experience in twenty minutes.",1,1,7,13 March 2014
