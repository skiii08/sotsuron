Mission: Impossible III," Best of the 3 Moviees
","Mission Impossible 3 has to be my favorite out of the series so far. It had all the action, suspense, and semi-predictable plot twist of the first movie. It also had the romance and happy ending of the second movie, but without it being over-the-top and uninteresting. I usually find the whole Tom Cruise goes to 'save the world' and 'save the girl' story lines boring and clich√©, but Michelle Monaghan's acting saves the movie from turning me off. Julia shows that she is not the stereotypical weak female in some of her final scenes where she kills two 'bad guys' and saves Ethan's life.The only reason I didn't rate this movie higher is because of Philip Seymour Hoffman. I find him extremely annoying and dry; his acting lacks the character needed to portray a villain. However, the damage he does to the movie is not substantial. This movie is definitely worth seeing and worth buying.",8,0,1,6 May 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Excellent film
","Little Miss Sunshine was refreshing and different. This film definitely is not for everyone. If you prefer laugh-out-loud Will Farrell type humor this movie probably is not for you. However the movie was surprisingly original among the slew of Hollywood remakes that came out last year. I am an avid Law and Order SVU fan, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how well Abigail Breslin adapted to the much less serious role of Olive in this film. She was charming and heartwarming, and even though her talents were a little less than conventional and pretty inappropriate, I found myself rooting for her at the end of the film. Also excellent in the film was Alan Arkin as the grandfather. Though his language and personality is abrasive, I found myself connecting to him as well, because of his self-fulfilling outlook on life. I felt myself relating to some characters in the family and I was repulsed by others. At the end of the film I felt uplifted because of the love that inevitably bound the family together. This is a must see film for anyone looking for originality and good fun.",10,3,6,2 January 2007
