The Expendables 2," Old school action? Is it for you??
","well, well, well...all the heroes of yesterday in one movie? it is amazing how 80's action doesn't really hold up today.. Don't get me wrong i enjoyed seeing Sly, Arnold, Bruce, JCVD, etc.. in one movie but it played out like a 80's action flick.. lots of guns, plenty of explosions, puns a plenty but not much acting.. I thought JCVD did a good job playing the bad guy and i think Scott Adkins was pretty good as his trusty sidekick but overall...i don't know.. i probably would have like to see more hand to hand fighting like the battles between Adkins vs Statham and Sly vs JCVD, still i had a good time and this was a guy movie..maybe an 80's guy movie but none the less... Hey Chuck Norris is in his 70's!!",6,0,0,22 September 2013
Here Comes the Boom," Kevin James..does he deliver the 'boom'?
",Kevin James delivers as only he can! The reigning 'big man' of comedy shows off his slimmer physique and pretty impressive MMA skills as the teacher turned fighter.. I laughed at parts but being a 'King of Queens' fan i guess i wanted more(no Leah Remni or Jerry Stiller?).. still think James is super talented actor and very funny... kudos to 'The Fonz' Henry Winkler and UFC great-turned actor Bas Rutten who both give great supporting roles...and Salma Hayek...well she isn't bad to look at..her acting...eh..a comedic Rocky-esque motion picture that everyone can enjoy! If you are a Kevin James fan this won't disappoint. good family film!!,6,3,3,29 September 2013
Jaws," Everyone will need a bigger boat...and possibly a change of undershorts!
","The first summer blockbuster still delivers after 35 plus years! Acting is top-notch.. Robert Shaw still remains my favorite as the doomed shark hunter Quint.. His speech about the USS Indianapolis, and of course his final encounter with the great white shark are two of my favorite moments in all of the movies i have seen.. I also like when Quint utters the line 'Stop playing with yourself Hooper' to Richard Dreyfuss character as he plays a game of what looks like solitaire. Blu-ray version only enhances this gem of a film.. The shark is missing a lot during this picture because of technical flaws but when it appears it is usually in a big way!!",10,2,5,15 September 2013
