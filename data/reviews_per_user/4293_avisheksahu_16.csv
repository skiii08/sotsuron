Scarface," Miami Sending You Home!
","Ascensions are brutal, especially when marked with overcoming heavy odds and towering obstacles for what goes up has to come down is the law manifested time and again in a million conquers. The best that has been done to allay such disincentives to the desire to conquer has been addressed to quite an extent in The Godfather 2 where the seemingly good judgement of the conqueror stretches his conquest to many years of depression instead of a precipitous crash into oblivion as is glorified in this one. Differences apart, this movie scores over the other in driving home that dreaded message not by drawing on the underprivileged upbringing of the chief protagonist but by glorifying the high that comes not from trumping your enemies but by trumping the ones you trumped your enemies with for what seems like plain old sibling rivalry in the higher echelons of the mafia translates into pretty much the same thing with more unacceptable connotations in the story of the rise of blood brothers finding family in the other's shortcomings. The lesson then is not in the inevitability of an informally contrived law, psychobabble at best, but in the primal motivation to see a conquest as an individual achievement, to be sustained and honed by the barely legible hierarchies forged in battle. Fluid hierarchies aren't demands of Organizational Behavior; instead, they are just frameworks that keep the economics of a setup from being dissected into pieces by rivals, ever aware of its genesis, and its foundations, to have accommodated it in their game of thrones.",10,0,0,1 May 2020
Catch Me If You Can," The Catch is in The Ignominy
","Reputation has always had a way with people as an incentive to follow society's agenda when the endeavor demands perspective to be firmly placed as its anti-thesis. While rationalizing as such could take you nowhere near the hallowed corners of every society's Australia, biting the bullet and going with the flow could only land you in a club of aberrations tuned to pursue an agenda larger than any individual within it and thereby immune to the threat of being an anti-social without the backing every spy thirsts for with his back to the wall.",6,0,0,2 May 2020
Training Day," Living On The Edge With an Eye on The Whole
","Cops everywhere have a choice, stark in their face, when the job self-details itself as non-existent when obedience takes a front seat, and as a ticket to a life in stun with the bet on a payback that honors the absolute insouciance at the ways of the world when made to fit a pattern. That said, the payback if not impossible enough for the honors that a life in stun begets, has to be carved out of the possibility that only a front-seat tryst with obedience proffers as its salvage of pride lost in keeping one from flying over the cuckoo's nest yet gained at vicariously living large in someone's lost shot at hell, for what can be gained by all can only be gained by one when the rigmarole at question has always been about keeping just that one in check. Dead-ends inherent in the chase apart, the movie runs along as if multitudes of options just open themselves up, as long as neither the impossibility nor the possibility sees a sliver of possibility in the impossibility!",8,0,1,2 May 2020
Oldboy," Oldboys, When They Come Back, Come Back for The Momos!
","It's easy to forget your calling in life when you are taught to seek your calling in that that begets acknowledgement that lasts right up to where you intend your calling to take you to spare you the pain of having to seek your calling to justify having to look for a reason to do whatever next to do. But then, if you are lucky, some random a**hole somewhere decides to get even with you and with money filched from any of your past self-perceived peccadilloes serves you steamed momos for the better part of your existence just to witness your chagrin at being undone with no hope for release. The release if depends almost entirely on your enterprise, legit, or illegit, ought to be then taken as a collective effort made possible with the comfort in those momos to survive the now much harsher world outside brandishing their wounds to snatch away that last piece you are now savoring happily under the sun!",10,0,0,6 May 2020
L.A. Confidential," Hit the Paparazzi Business
","Yeah, this movie does just that: it takes bread out of the hands of The Papparazi because it unrepentantly lays bare the murky world behind the tint of glamour. Stars work for us, and take a hit where it hurts, at least where it would hurt most of our judgemental audience, ever willing to draw joy out of their work and then pan them for their lifestyle aspired to and looked-down-upon at the same time. Hypocrisy doesn't exist in Hollywood, it just exists within the audience that is often too coy, or too lazy to acknowledge their deepest desires.",9,0,2,23 February 2019
The Color of Money," Hustle Evolves In Hustle's Court!
","The movie offers a peek into circumstances that notoriously evolve when experience thinks it owns talent and talent thinks experience owes it big time. While the end hints at the subsequent dominion of talent, the climactic crescendo is eerily suggestive of the persistent pain in experience for not having shown talent what talent used to be!",10,0,0,14 February 2019
American Beauty," Evening out Qualitative Development
","Prima facie, the movie removes curtains on what hides behind a tantalizing setup always geared towards saving the world with wisdom, firepower, and political nous; on a deeper watch though, it shows the way forward across societies, with or without a private garage with tools to machinate the best drive out of your mortgaged car: it evens out the psychological chasm between high society and the middle class, waters down the aspirations that are sold by malafide corporate goals, and shows that unions were never supposed to be enlivening: just plain downright madenning, yet the only way forward, or you crash into the past with just petty grudges to show as an alibi for your downfall.",10,0,0,14 December 2019
Tigerland," The Mother of All War Movies
","An outstanding movie that takes the lid off the motivations behind war. You think you are being sent to fight the enemies, but the enemy always lies within your squadron, your regiment, or your dormitory, waiting for you to latch on to the prospects of being a war hero!",10,0,2,14 February 2019
Good Will Hunting," For Want of a Crash
","Disillusionment is a profound luxury, for a library has been built over the blood of many, similarly unendowed, and dissimilarly acknowledged for their worth, for a little word in either context while creating ripples in the immediate surroundings of one could set fire to an industry in the other for not being able to contain the ripples in an age where fishes are finned at sea only to be grilled on land. This interpretation is starkly evident in the climax where the pain of guilt is neatly suspended for a new lease of life shelved abruptly back home by those who call dibs at being the underdog at leading with the chin at subliminal treachery.",7,0,0,1 May 2020
Jerry Maguire," Courting Depression Where You Ought to Seek its Redemption
","Romances aren't overrated, in movies or anywhere else, just like a good meal isn't overrated, in a Michelin Star Outlet, or in a critically reviewed roadside joint, for the whole point in the brouhaha, conspicuous in the latter context at least, is the investment in an experience, traditionally, with nothing to show for it in the game of being socially relevant. If the point of being Buffet is to give away your wealth, if the point of being Buddha is to abdicate your throne, if the point of being a man is to go dancing with the wolves (sic), then the point in being in romance is to lose the hero in you that you went finding on your first chase after the skirt!",8,2,3,1 May 2020
Pulp Fiction," Elegance in Absurdity
","America is big because it has the capacity to give reputation to absurdity. This movie does just that: it is absurd, but it is beautiful!",9,0,1,16 February 2019
Mystic River," No Looking Back!
","Baggage hurts, when money is concerned, for if Gangsters teach us anything, it is that reconciliation is never an option; that doesn't mean however that reconcialition has to be a compromise: it just has to look like a compromise!",9,1,1,3 August 2019
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," From University to The Graduate
","This movie, and particularly this one, puts movie studios on par with famed educational institutes when it comes to backing an agenda with just a cursory glance at the bottom line. Human rights are violated where human rights exist, and if they did, verification of identity wouldn't have been an exercise in hell for those primed at keeping a billion people in check with a ballot box and a beaver eyed media unearthing conspiracies two tits at a time!",7,0,0,1 May 2020
Munich," The Game Exists Where The Fear and The Risk Persists
","The most landmark movie of our times in the context of highlighting political imbroglios of a social sort considering the drift in movie studios has always been to pitch a victor versus a vanquished irrespective of the brickbats that sort of endeavor attracts in a highly globalised and interconnected world where sugar from Peru is delved in Tea from Darjeeling placed in a cup of porcelain made in China. While the ask seems to entirely veer towards showing the ever prevalent plight of Israel in its quest for survival with often narry a chance at the same, the Palestinians and their affiliates, in this picturization at least, come across as as significant in their heroism as do seemingly bona-fide spies with formal backing. What starts as a defence of government manifested as a microcosmic representation of world society translates into a pain of defence of that same microcosmic representation now manifested even more microcosmically in personal human relationships formalised macrocosmically in world society as what we call 'family', essentially, as could be derived from the whole tale, a notional formalisation to prevent enemies from tearing at your roots for being a representation of that microcosmic manifestation of world society that couldn't factor in some others in their limited perception of how a family should be macrocosmically, or microcosmically!",9,0,0,8 June 2020
Goodfellas," A Masterclass in Screenplay and Dialogue
","The way I wrote my book For A Pint of Mother's Milk was inspired a lot by how this movie was made: great storytelling is not about the plot, it's never about the plot; it's about the journey and the small details within it: the way you sliced garlic in prison, how rare your steak was cooked, what Pauli said and how he said it, the small interesting piquing elements that strike joy in the audience's heart; they'll feel terrific but they won't exactly know why! It takes guts to tell a story with no explicit plot and tell it well; then it's all about the treatment, and all about the direction: if it doesn't work you take all the blame, if it does, you basically strike gold. The only way to go for purely narcissistic directors and writers.",10,0,0,18 February 2019
The Godfather," When Capitalism Beckoned Communism With a Dash of Olive Oil!
","This movie could easily be pitched as the most landmark creation in cinematographic history for setting the tone of Social Education in the coming years, given serious cosmetic evolution was just on the cards and more than ever, money just had to sit in the right hands to make social sense. While the thirst for bonafide business ventures has been ripe within mankind for the longest time, it is just a badly kept secret that suckers for reputation almost always fall back on triads and godfathers to save their skin from the vengeance of their hitherto ignorant audience suddenly awaken from their poverty induced deep sleep when outsiders take notice of their insouciance and insiders take notice of their pride. Made at the dawn of the fall of the family as a mega-institution, it insinuates that the appeal in gangsters never lay in the fashion or the thrust but in the starkly bare realisation imperative in their context that money finds you only when have people around you to call family, for what needs to find you needs a road to find you, and the homeless never ever had it easy in times of war and in times of peace! If that's too much of a lesson, Marlon Brando's otherworldly performance is just pure, uncorrupted education in theatre.",10,1,1,14 February 2019
