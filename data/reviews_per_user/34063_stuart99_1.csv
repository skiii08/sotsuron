The Blair Witch Project," I WAS ROBBED
","Popcorn and soda at the ready I sat in the darkened cinema waiting to be entertained by 'the scariest move of the decade', the film to bring in a new breed of horror. Eighty minutes later I left the cinema looking for a policeman to report the robbery of Â£5.00 and one hour twenty minutes of my life. To say this film is bad is like saying the speed of light is a bit quick. However I have the utmost respect for Danny and Eddie, the two geniuses who made millions out of conning the public all over the world into parting with good money to see three people standing in a forest yelling at each other for over an hour. And of course who can argue with the fantastic idea to keep on the edge of your seat called filming a tree in the dark. In short the only thing worse then The Blair Witch Project is the fact that some people go and see it twice, a definite case of the kings new clothes.",Null,1,2,20 January 2000
