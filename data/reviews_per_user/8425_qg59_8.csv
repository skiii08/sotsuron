Casablanca," Best film pre 1970
","I think this is one of those movies that if i would have seen it when it first came out, i would have enjoy it a lot more. But it was still a good movie none the less. I just didn't find it as good as a lot of other people would think. The acting was great, as Humphrey Bogart always is. The story was also very interesting. I liked the twist at the end. So simple, yet so complex. Thats kind of what the whole movie is. Very simple, but yet at the same time somewhat complex. And i think what makes it complex is Bogart's character. Its so hard to read his thoughts. Thus, displaying the good acting by Bogart. I would suggest this movie to any guy who's girlfriend is begging him to see a romance movie. Trust me, this will be the best one you will ever see.",7,1,5,21 July 2006
The Godfather: Part II," 2nd only to the first
","Everything about this movie is equal to the first one. In my opinion the only thing that makes the first one better is Marlon Brando. But this one is a close second. Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, and Diane Keaton continue to do an amazing job. What i enjoyed most was the transition of Michael corleone from what seemed to be a good guy in the first movie, to a villain by the end of the 2nd film. Again, another long movie that can be somewhat hard to endure its length. But thats definitely not from a lack of drama. If you like drama, this is the movie for you. Male or female, old or young, this movie should interest you.",10,1,2,21 July 2006
The Pianist," Don't let the Title fool you, this movie isn't just about a guy who plays the Piano
","It took me a while to see this movie, because i saw the title, and it just looked boring. WRONG. For starters, Adrien Brody was amazing. I would compare his acting with the like of Marlon Brando in The Godfather, and Tom Hanks in Forest Gump. He makes this movie, so great. I usually don't enjoy movies like this, like Schinldlers list i though was boring. This movie, was not boring. I think it was the way that i felt like i was the main character. The struggles he goes through are so great, you just feel like you yourself are going through an emotional roller-coaster. This is one of those movies that may in some way change your life. I definitely recommend it to anybody.",10,1,3,21 November 2006
Schindler's List," Good movie, but slightly overrated
","I'm probably, well i know i am, against the majority of people who have seen this movie, but i didn't think this movie was as great as what i have heard. It was such a long movie, i nearly fell asleep. The bright spot in this movie was Liam Neeson, who played Oscar Schindler. He was flawless. I really like his emotion towards the end of the movie. Thats my favorite part. I know this isn't supposed to be a movie that people are supposed to really enjoy, so maybe that is a reason for my lower rating. I would suggest this movie only if you haven't seen any movies about the Holocaust before. Personally, i thought the Pianist was a better film than this one.",5,1,6,21 July 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," worth watching over and over
","I loved the plot in this movie. Throughout this movie i felt like i was Andy. I wasn't watching Andy, i was Andy. And Morgan freeman was my best friend. This only says that the acting was superb. This movie is always on TV and though i don't think i have watched the whole thing one time through, i have seen all of it in different parts at least 30 times, and each time i long that i haven't seen the movie from start to finish. So i recommend all to buy it, as its something i need to go out and do myself. Mordan Freeman is one of the greatest actors of all time and after seeing this movie, you will believe so. This movie is defiantly in my top 5 list. The only movies i would say have better acting is the first to god fathers.",10,0,0,21 July 2006
Casino Royale," Came into this movie closed minded, came out, blown out of my mind.
","This is a very surprising great movie. I must admit, i thought it was very foolish to have a blond haired looking blond. I grew up with Brosnin so thats what i expected. But Daniel Craigg, does an absolutely excellent job. I think this is because he is his own Bond, he doesn't try and copy Brosnin. He is tougher, more crude, definitely more humorous. You can definitely tell this movie is about him learning the ropes of being a 00 agent. This movie, has great action scenes, which is expected from a bond. But surprisingly, this movie has some very funny parts to it and they aren't cheesy either. This Bond beats all of Brosnins Bonds. And Brosnin was good.",9,3,7,21 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," This one was definitely the best of the three
","I would have probably given this at least a 9 rating if it wasn't so long. There were some points in the film when i began to get bored. Maybe its just because I'm not a huge fan of the fantasy and sci fi genre.One thing i did really like about this movie when i wasn't bored was how thrilling it was. From the battle scenes to Frodo's and Sam's adventure to destroy the ring.Vigo Mortinson was awesome in this movie. Not only his acting but the way he displayed the character had me believing he was, whatever it is that he was. Maybe thats another reason for the only 8 rating was that i was somewhat confused as to what the whole setting was.I suggest this movie to anyone who has 3 and a half hours to waste, but don't put off something too important to watch it.",4,2,7,21 July 2006
The Godfather," Best acting ever
","I think what made this movie so great was the actors. The directing was also very superb. As i watched this movie, 30 plus years or so after it was made, i totally was engulfed in what was going on in the movie. Most great movies that i see that are older seem to be dull and boring, not this one. Yes it is long, and i had to take frequent breaks, it was far from boring. This is one of those movies that after i saw it i started acting like i was in a mob family. I started saying 'I'm going to make him an offer he cant refuse.' This movie is a great movie that mixes all kinds of genres, from romance to action, but it is mostly a full out drama. This movie is defiantly deserving of the top honor for best movie. I recommend it to all people, and even if you cant appreciate the plot, you have to appreciate the acting. By far the best acting in any film i have ever seen.",10,2,5,21 July 2006
