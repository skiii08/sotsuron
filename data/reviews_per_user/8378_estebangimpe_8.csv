The Rock," 'We may be dealing with one of the greatest soldiers in the Vietnam war I s**t you not!'
","Hey, this is my review! at the end of the day, its your opinion that really counts.The Rock, one of my favourite action movies of all time. When I first sat down to watch this movie at the age of 12, I was satisfied with what I was seeing. After the movie ended, I place the DVD back in the box and completely forgot about it. One year later, I would re-watch it and completely fall in love with it.The Rock tells the story of a retired army general who steals a lot of deadly weapons and then sets up his own mini military base in Alcatraz (AKA. The Rock) The Government is soon aware of this and sends in a full SEALS team, along with an FBI chemist (Cage) and an ex-convict of Alcatraz who happened to work in the British Intelligence (Connery) Chessy, Check. Over the top, Check. Awesome, double check.This movie will leave you at the edge of your seat. Not only does it have some of the best Hollywood action scenes of all time, it also has one of the GREATEST action actors in the history of cinema: Michael Biehn. Yes, you heard right. I think he is the main reason why I praise this movie so much. Not only does he deliver a brilliant (as always) performance but he also says some of the best b-movie lines of all time.Besides Biehn, this movie is pure greatness. If you by are a person who enjoys nice action flicks, then you will find The Rock amazing. However, if you happen to be one of those picky 'I want realistic stuff' person, then stay far far far away from this movie. You have been warnedGreat Hollywood Action movie.9/10",9,2,4,18 September 2008
The Mask," The Mask: The king of the rumba beat
","Now this is a movie that everyone should see: The Mask.Stanley Ipkiss (played by the young and mighty Jim Carrey) has never had too much luck in his life. He works in a bank, has trouble talking to girls and watches cartoons before going to sleep. All this changes one night when he finds an ancient mask in the sea. From curiosity, he tries on the mask and BAM! one of the greatest monsters from the 90's is born. Now with a green face and a goofy yellow suit, the mask heads out to the city to live the good life. His pockets loaded with ridiculous gadgets and his mouth filled with cheesy one liners.The Mask is a lot of fun to watch. Rarely does a movie take you to such an unusual situation and makes it relateable to the audience. Jim Carrey executes his role with comedic perfection. His voice, movements and expressions almost make it seem as if he had once upon a time been a maniac with the green face. The other actress that needs a mentioning is Cameron Diaz, making her debut as one of the sexiest women of all time. She brings all the boys out their seats and makes all the women jealous. Don't be surprise if you keep coming back to see this movie just because of her.I recommend this movie to those who are looking for a fun time. It's a great movie and it will bring out the Cuban Pete we all hide inside our soul.9 SMOKING stars out of 10",9,1,1,14 November 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious Quentin
","As the lights of the theater began to brighten and the credits began to pop up I found myself struggling to close my jaw. I guess that's just one of the many side effects you get from watching something as amazing as Inglorious Basterds. The movie is everything it needs to be: A Tarantino movie...that's it! If you like Recervoir Dogs and If you liked Pulp Fiction don't think twice about watching this flick, it's simply Tarantino doing what he does best: long dialogs, amazing action scenes, brilliant characters and an incredibly unrealistic yet attractive situation. Q.T somehow took the secret spices out of all his best movies and combined it into a genre that's old as the event itself but always great to explore: The second world war. The cast is as close as you can get to perfection. I don't understand why people complain about Brad Pitt using the southern accent, I thought it was one of his best performance not simply because he pulls it off so well but because the character is so over the top you can't help but notice him having fun as he recites his lines. The rest of the cast does an amazing job at filling the atmosphere with that intensity and humor that Tarantino has trademarked and you simply can't get enough of any of them. Although it runs for more than two hours, I.B feels short, mainly because the times goes by really fast as you watch it. Many will undoubtedly hate this movie and that's why I suggest the following: if you like Q.T movies (like me) go see this film. If you DON'T like Q.T movies....well...don't go see this film. I think i've made my point9/10",9,5,17,21 August 2009
Grease," Grease is not just the word, it is the greatest musical of all times
","You can hate me or you can love me all you want for this review. At the end of the day, all that should matter is your opinion.Grease is not just a 70's fancy musical, it is a symbol to an era, an era when you could make a musical that had enough character to be great.Today there is High School Musical, Rock Camp etc. I have been fortunate enough (sarcasm) to watch all of these musicals, and I can't even begin to explain how much I hate them. They lack of two basic things, originality and being fun. And what a coincidence! because those are both of the mayor elements that makes Grease such a great movie. Released in 1978, Grease left a mayor print in the whole world. Well, there are many movies that have done that, so why does Grease stand out more? Honestly, because the film wasn't that good.I mean think about it. What is the plot in this movie? a guy that spends his whole high school year trying to get back together with his summer love while doing annoying things along the way. Not much of a plot is it? And the moral? being a jerk who gets into fights, ignores his friends and doesn't do anything at school will help you turn your summer crush into a smoking cool girl who ends up with you in the end despite all the times you tried to get into her panties? Not a very great moral, in fact, most of High School based movies usually have the cool guys being the bad guys and in the end they lose. So by now you might be saying, How can you say at that this movie is great and then trash its plot and moral? Well, if I may continue, I'd have to say that the greatest thing about this movie, is that you don't really care for the plot or the moral. You watch this movie, and you have FUN!The songs are great, the dancing is great, the humour is great and you'd think that without a plot the movie could be impossible to watch, but no; you are so entertained while watching Grease that you wouldn't care if someone's child dies in the middle of the film. By the way, for all of you who haven't seen the movie, that doesn't happen.Yes it's very corny, the actors that are suppose to be in their teen years look like they're thirty and the character development is not very deep. But I'll say it again, you WON'T CARE! and that is why this movie is considered to be one of the best musicals of all time. It manages to take the incredibly picky movie critics out of us and makes us sing and dance along with it, WITHOUT COMPLAINING!!Nowadays, directors have tried to create a musical which has the same power as Grease. Most of them have failed miserably to try and hide the lack of plot or horrible acting, leaving them as cinema failures who only the eight year old girls will like. HSM and many others may have a great commercial success for kids, but its Grease which truly makes a cheesy school musical enjoyable for the whole family.Grease was, is and shall always be the word10/10",8,12,19,17 September 2008
The Thing," okay, listen to me very carefully..
","Once you finish reading this I want you to do the following: Turn your computer off. Save all the files that need to be saved. Put your shoes on, grab your wallet and your keys. Get out of your house and find the closest rental store or DVD store. Simply go in Buy or rent John Carpenter's The Thing and walk out. There's really no need of getting a second movie. Get back home, disconnect your phone, turn off your cellphone and turn all your lights off. Make sure you are alone, no girl/boyfriend, no best friend, no parents. Watch it. This may seem like a ridiculous review right now but trust me, once the credits pop up, you will be thanking me I wrote these instructions for you. Enjoy the night10/10",10,6,9,22 August 2009
Gran Torino," get the hell off my lawn!
","Gran Torino, a movie based on the reactions of Clint Eastwood when he switched on the TV to find 'Paris Hilton's new BFF' on MTV. The movie centers around a American war veteran (from the Korean war, not the Vietnamese one) who faces the issues of immigrant societies in the USA. If the words 'latino or Asian gangs' haven't popped out of your head then you're in for quite a ride.Eastwood plays a truly stubborn old man who hates EVERYBODY. Eastwood is not afraid to express this in the first half of the movie as he constantly growls at everyone. His voice is not sweet and he mostly uses it to throw up some of the most hilarious and typical one liners.'Get the hell of my lawn!' he violently says to his neighbour with an eye so evil it would make lions cry. You can't help but laugh at this and of course, you already know that he'll soften up as the movie continues. So as the minutes go by, he begins to care for his neighbours and he becomes the hero of the neighbourhood (long story, go read a real boring review to find out what he actually did) and he realizes that he has something to care about. The rest, is not to be spoiled (because if I told you it would be cheating wouldn't it?)So I've told you practically everything and yet nothing about the plot (mission accomplished!) and now it's time to face the real highs and lows of the film: Clint Eastwood is great! his character is very well developed (didn't see that coming did you?) and his acting is top notch. The problem: the rest of the characters are PATHETIC. The dialog between them seems to have been written by Flavour *bling* *bling* Flav and the actors are awful. This brings up the question: Was Eastwood a good actor or was he simply better than these....other actors? Only time will tell my fellow readers (getting very intellectual now). The truth is that Gran Torino is a film that feels that it was created simply so that Eastwood could get a shot at another Oscar (Clint, you've got like 4 of those already. When will you give it a rest?) Eastwood helped himself to all the best aspects of the movie and left nothing else for the rest of the cast. It's not a bad film, it's enjoyable and you'll love Clint every second of the film. You'll just wish that everything else was better.In conclusion, I give Gran Torino seven very shiny stars out of ten. If it would have been called Clint Eastwood vs. MTV I would have given it eight stars...but that's life.",7,0,4,7 April 2009
Into the Wild," inside the movie of into the wild
","Into the Wild may not be the greatest movie of all time. However, this doesn't restrain it from the fact that it is a great film. Being the first time that i watched a creation of Sean Penn, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, and to be honest neither were the others who were watching the movie with me.Into the Wild tells the story of a young graduate living in a high life society who escapes the comfort of his parents materialism and goes on the road to discover new places and most importantly, to live a new life. On his journey he meets hippies, farmers and much much more. As time flies by, he becomes more and more independent of money and builds up to his ultimate goal: To reach the high grounds of Alaska and live with and off the wild.Into the Wild is a complex movie supported by a great cast, great scene of photography and a compelling story. It is a film which will leave you thinking, trying to find the true message Sean Penn was trying to insert into our heads. This is where Into the Wild truly shines, because there is no clear message. It is the audience which can decide the cause of the what,where,why and when. Sean Penn has created a masterpiece which allows us to establish the basis of the story and have it represent our own thoughts.Beware tho, this movie is quite long (140 minutes) and to truly enjoy, you must not question the realism of the film, you must embrace it and only then will you find your own message and conclusion to the movie.Into The Wild receives nine stars out of ten from me. It is a beautiful piece of art which will re-define your ideas on the needs of an adolescent. Don't miss out!",9,1,3,13 February 2009
WALL·E," I felt like a child again....
","When I was six years old, I used to watch all the great Dysney classics such as Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. I remember those epic moments of the movie where something magical would happen, something that was truly unique. I would get butterflies in my stomach and I would feel like I was in the actual movie, sitting on the flying carpet next to Aladding and Jasmin. As time went by, this feeling went away. I grew up and children's movies evolved to become a bunch of 3D animals who were all played by celebrity voices. I had begun to move away from the children's movies and had moved on to more adult ones. It had come to a point where I would feel sick from just watching the trailer of Madagascar. And then..out of nowhere...came Wall-e.I went into the cinema with low expectations. I was hoping to have a couple of laughs and walk out with a mild satisfaction. But I got a LOT more. Wall-e brings back that magic I spoke about. That magic that made you want to watch the movie over and over again. I knew what was going to happen. I knew that there was going to be a happy ending. But I will not forget how much emotion I expressed in that movie theater. During the middle of the film, I began to feel strange, to feel a bit warm in my tummy. At first, I didn't really react, but then I noticed. I was that same feeling I used to have when I was a child. That same feeling!! I left the cinema with my mouth open. I couldn't not believe that I had just gone through. So that is why i'm sitting here writing this for you. Yes, the visuals are impressive and the story line is great. But the feeling of being six again is incomparable. I recommend this film to everyone. But I think that only those who remember the magic that Dysney gave us, will truly appreciate how great this movie is. Thank you Wall-e. Thank you for making me feel young and innocent again.10/10",10,2,5,11 September 2008
