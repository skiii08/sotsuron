The Blair Witch Project," maybe the best movie ever made
",I always heard my parents talk about this movie but never dared to see it myself. When i recently started doing a film course I told myself to go watch the movie. And oh my im totally obsessed with it. This movie really shows you don't need the best equipment or a record amount of money to make a great movie. The idea behind this film is the whole power it needed. This movie plays with fully black screens and still manages to keep the viewer's interest. I can barely explain how amazing I think this film is. I think it must be put on the mandatory watchlist of every filmmaker ever.,10,3,6,7 October 2019
