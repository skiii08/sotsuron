Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Where's the Movie?
","My advice to those who have not seen the movie is to show up late, really late.  The first 90% of the movie is garbage, but the final lightsaber battle is probably the coolest of the series.  Any criticism you have read or heard about is probably true.",2,0,1,15 June 1999
