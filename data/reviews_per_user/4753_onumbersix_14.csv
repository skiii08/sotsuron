The Avengers," Can one remain sane?
","Simple eye candy where all matters of CGI are displayed on film? Sure, it is. The difference this time is that there is a real story, albeit far-fetched. This film has the distinction to bring together many Super-heroes that have graced the big screen in recent years to pool their resources and talents to save the World from a terrifying menace that would reduce humanity to nothing more than an ant hill. It's the classic good vs. evil battle. Guess who wins? To its merit, the film underlines the character flaws of these larger than life beings. Can one be complete sane when omnipotent? The question had to be raised. Not my usual kind of film, but effective. It is noteworthy that Robert Downey Jr.'s usual amusing presence raises the quality of the whole.",7,1,7,2 June 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sherlock Holmes : Superhero
","When bucolic Victorian England of the 19th century is propelled without restraint into the 21st. Sherlock Holmes a superhero? Who would have believed it? We do, mainly because of Robert Downey Jr's unbridled performance. Always one of my favorites in spite of all his personal angsts remains a phenomenon. When will he get to tackle the role which will make him the new Brando? This one isn't it, but amusing all the same. A true roller coaster of unrelenting action. The storyline is hard to follow at times but we can catch up easily along the way. And what about Ritchie's (this Madonna's Ex) style of slow motion and freeze frame shots to great effect. Are we witnessing a trademark in the line of Leone's majestic close-ups or Kubrick's cold reality? Time will tell. At the very least, we can say that it captivates, because I haven't heard an audience applaud a film with such enthusiasm in a long time. This film is candy, but good candy.",8,0,2,28 December 2011
Skyfall," I have reluctantly become a Bond fan
","I have never been a great fan of James Bond, our favourite movie psychopath for 50 years now. The one and only Bond movie that drew me to the theatre was Diamonds are forever, in 1971. I went not so much for Connery's Bond with his smug attitude, but his Bond girl, Jill St-John, who was my secret love at the time and even more so, when I found myself sitting in front of her on the Expo-Express at Expo 67, in Montréal. For sure over the years I saw bits and pieces of Bond movies on late night television, but that is pretty much the extent of my experience. So why did I go to the cinema this time? Well, because of Daniel Craig this actor who continues to impress, notably in the Millennium remake. Add to that, the almost unanimous reviews stating that it is a good Bond movie, maybe the best to date. So, it did not appear to me that I was going to sit through a bomb. Is it as good as they say? Affirmative. It's 2 and half hours of continuous action, of intelligent dialogue and nice kudos to the past 50 years of the series. The return of the classic DB5 is a good example. The Bond franchise was getting long in the tooth for at least a decade, if not more. Skyfall marks a sharp departure with the past and bodes well for the future.",8,3,11,17 November 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Let's see what Jackson does with this
","Highly anticipated film especially in the French speaking world. First, visually the film is amazing. The true to life reproduction of Hergé's universe is without reproach. The original story taken from unrelated stories in the series is also very interesting. We were well warned and is easily accepted. We really get the impression of seeing a whole new adventure without knowing what will come next. What comes next, are characters that are underdeveloped. This is particularly true of the two main heroes, Tintin and Haddock. The exception here might be Snowy. We don't find the essence of their personalities so well defined trough the 24 albums of the series. Where are all of Haddock's unique expressions? This original story is full of totally impossible situations that the albums never reached, which unfolds at a frightening pace. Finally, I found the humour sparse and not really that funny. It's obvious that the market aimed for are the young video game playing boys. If this film brings a whole new generation to Hergé's universe, that would be a good thing. The next film of the series is likely to be closer to the essence of Tintin, as Peter Jackson will be the director. He is admittedly a Tintin fan since his childhood. Spielberg came to Tintin in his late thirties, after being told of a vague resemblance to a well-known archaeologist.",7,1,2,21 December 2011
Bridge of Spies," Great visuals as expected in a Spielberg film
","Spielberg's film is always a treat for the eye. He manages to recreate America and Europe of the 'cold war' era with great aplomb. I defy anyone to find anachronistic errors in the visuals of the film. This film reunites the director with Tom Hanks. Hanks, who plays regularly this type of American who has integrity and honesty, and is driven by a strong sense of justice. He follows in the cinematic tradition of Gary Cooper and James Stewart, but does not add much to the genre, if only modernity.With a director so focused on the visuals, the depth of the characters remains deficient. Even a script signed by the Cohen brothers, amazingly did not help much. So I remained with the question: how does this fairly ordinary lawyer become so heroic in environments of hostile international intrigues.",7,1,3,28 October 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Simply extraordinary!
","A Swedish cinematic trilogy which was a great hit in its country and we can understand why. Americans feel obliged to remake these foreign gems with often unfortunate results, but not this time. My state of mind after seeing this film in one word: WOW!An extraordinary film on so many levels. A mysterious modern whodunit in which the story is peeled away one layer at a time, without revealing the rest to come. An almost futurist thriller, where the new information technologies are center stage. An imagery of reality in the raw. Complex and vulnerable characters. Fast paced action which keeps you riveted to the screen for more than 2 hours. And what can be said of this resilient character, Lisabeth, the girl with the dragon tattoo who dominates all her scenes in a role which surely will mark cinematic history for years to come, no less. Even Daniel Craig earns my kudos for his role. There are so many ways to appreciate this film that I'll probably go back for a second viewing while it is still in the theatres. It's really that good. Six weeks after its release and the theatre is sold out, a rare feat nowadays. Truly a standout film.",9,3,8,26 January 2012
The Intouchables," Intouchables? Enough already!
","Having resisted long enough all the hype hammering the luster of this jewel of a film, I finally decide to go see for myself. I resisted mainly because it seemed to me that this story had been told so many times before in film. Added the fact that French comedies don't do it for me, with the noted exception of Amélie Poulin. Italian comedies and British black humour manage to reach me more. So these Intouchables? One word : disappointed, but not surprised. The story is predictable and simple, avoiding to bruise sensibilities. Plays to sentimentality. This indecently rich heir to the family fortune, after becoming a paraplegic hires an in-home male nurse straight from the ghetto and they develop a deep friendship. How beautiful! Can you feel my irony ? It is said to be «inspired» by a true story. OK! But what gets me, is ignoring the elephant in the room, that is the meeting between great wealth and hopelessly abject poverty, without a thought that the former cannot exist without the latter. And to think that the French have just voted in the Left with a majority.François Cluzet's acting didn't seem credible to me. His pasted and silly smile, like Dustin Hoffman's Rainman, gives you the impression of great wisdom to be revealed later. But later never comes. He looks stupid and is, in many ways. What makes the film ultimately is Omar Sy's character, this handsome young black man, with the killer smile, who pushes mischief to the limit. This type of character usually amuses polite society.Intouchables? Enough already!",5,27,79,21 June 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The formula as usual.
","Having seen most of the films playing that I wanted to see and not being impressed by the new offerings, I decided to go for eye candy and leave my brain at the door. Unfortunately, the latter came to join me anyway and at that point everything unravelled. Critics claimed that this 4th outing in the series was the best, which doesn't bode well for the previous ones which I didn't bother to see. As a teen, I loved this TV series with often well thought out stories. What I liked most of M-I on TV was the way they used every day objects in innovating ways to great effect. But in this film, we are in super effects to fill the eye, especially in Imax, along with doubtful tools. Everything in fact to try to mask an improbable story. Tom Cruise shows us once again his depth by playing Tom Cruise as usual, as he did in so many films before. It gets tiring in the end. He plays this intrepid and invincible American hero who fears nothing, save pretending the fear of heights to pretend to be comical. I could hardly wait for the end of this.",5,3,8,3 February 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," A wonderful revisit
","A rare chance it is to revisit this majestic cinema classic on the big screen. I was 15 when I was first marvelled by this film shown in «Cinerama». It was like the future was it front me urging the young man I was to proceed into it wholeheartedly. It was beautiful. It was a dream. The effects are so realistic especially in these times of CGI. We rightly wonder how Kubrick managed this feat. The ending was a little disappointing for me as a kid and it still is. In fact, in this viewing I asked myself, why Bowman after surviving HAL and having the whole resources of Discovery at his disposal, he didn't simply return to Earth instead of diving head first in eternity? Of course the dramatic effect would have been lessened but it would have been more realistic. Survival outweighs curiosity in my opinion. But this is a dream and it is well as such. I have seen this film uncounted times and also have it on DVD, but I must admit that nothing beats it on the big screen. A must see, again and again.",10,0,1,19 January 2012
Titanic," Titanic in 3D and AVX
","Titanic in 3D. I had never seen this film before. Is that possible? At least not in its entirety, with bits and pieces here and there caught on TV throughout the years. At the time of its release, I said to myself: Ah, just another love story and besides I know the ending. I must admit now, it's not so bad. Quite good in fact. Almost 3 and a half hours well spent. While watching, I had a thought for my Grand-father who, had he crossed over only 2 years later, might have very well gone down with the Titanic and I wouldn't be here to tell the story. Finally, I don't particularly enjoy Céline Dion's choice of songs but I have to admit to a guilty tear when I hear the Titanic song.",8,2,3,6 April 2012
To Kill a Mockingbird," Great film to see or see again
","Many cinemas offer repeat performances of great films of the past in remastered digital form. What a joy for those of us who missed these gems first time around for all kinds of reasons. These digital presentations are of high quality. This film inspired by the novel of the same name awakened in its day sensibilities of the outrageous racism still prevalent in 1962 America even though the story is set in 1932 Alabama. Remember the Civil rights Act was passed in to law only in 1964. This film has lost nothing of its relevance today and doesn't give in to blatant innocence so common in American cinema of the era, largely influenced by the Disney studios. This film is in no way complacent and very watchable by today's standards. But what makes it most remarkable is the children's portrayals. The story is largely told from their point of view, especially that of scout, the wonderful and mischievous little girl, son natural and endearing. She was even nominated for an Oscar which would have made her the youngest winner at 10 years old at the time. We can see where Steven Spielberg got his inspirations for films such as ET, Super8, etcÂ… A great film to see or to see again.",9,0,1,16 February 2012
Prometheus," An Alien by any other name...
","When director Ridley Scott (Alien and Blade runner) does a science fiction film, it is an event. The film takes us 70 years in the future aboard the space vessel Prometheus en route to an unknown planet which is believed to harbour a mystery highly sought after. The parallels with Alien are numerous. In many ways, this story is the un-admitted prequel to Alien with the added bonus of some explanations. Alien was high on horror and anticipation, but lacking in information and motivation.In both films, space exploration is in the hands of private enterprise which subjugates scientific rigour to megalomania. When Alien came to the screens, I remember finding this omnipresence of Capitalism in space exploration far-fetched. Today, I must admit that we are headed in that direction and speedily at that. Just think of the space tourists. We again find a lactated android who keeps vital information from the crew and follows his own agenda. It is highly unlikely that a dozen people sent far into space would not have access to vital information. Smoking is still a habit in this near future although in sharp decline today, except maybe in Asia, which will surely come around in the next 70 years. Again we find a strong heroine. In Alien she was called Ripley, her she is Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace. We remember her as the ground breaking heroine Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium series (the Swedish version). Probably one of Scott's inside jokes, Rapace's character is named Elizabeth Shaw. The resemblance between the two names is too great for a coincidence. More than 30 years after Alien, a reprise of similar movie effects and storyline does not move today's audiences as before. There are many characters in this film that lack development. We are all together surprised when these illustrious unknowns do the ultimate sacrifice. There will be a sequel no doubt, the ending leads us on.",6,1,7,4 July 2012
Spectre," Back to same-old same-old... too bad!
","I've never been a big fan of that beloved psychopath of British- American cinema: James Bond 007. Of course, after a series of more than 25 films over 50 years, I have seen a number of them, especially on late night TV, when there is nothing more interesting to watch. What was holding me back, it was mainly the gross improbability of the situations, the caricatured characters facing a hero with an outdated machismo and almost papal invincibility. That said, I went to see Skyfall the previous opus because of mainly favourable reviews and some measure of respect for the actor, Daniel Craig. I came out delighted and went back to see it again in IMAX. Finally I said to myself: a smart movie with little gratuitous violence which had emotional consequences. James Bond could sometimes suffer. What realism! So Spectre comes along. Having been won over to the series, I cheerfully took myself to the cinema, even if critics were not as glowing this time around. I must regret that they've returned to the cheesy recipe of: action-seduction-risk-win. All that I criticized earlier is back stronger than ever. An additional disappointment is Christopher Waltz, so great in 'Django unchained' but so bland here. Malcolm McDowell would have been so superior in the skin of this king of villains.",6,1,4,4 December 2015
The Martian," Damon as Martian was good, with DiCaprio would be great...
","In short, it is yet another story of a castaway. This time he is on Mars, alone and left for dead. This film is the work of the master of the genre: Ridley Scott (Alien, Prometheus ...). The effects and scenery are very realistic. As a strictly science fiction movie, we can't ask for more. However, the drama misses the mark. The acting miserably lacks passion and intensity. Again Matt Damon, this Hollywood 'pretty boy' plays out in one of his two trademark registers: the 'good guy' or the 'eternal teenager.' This time he offers us the first. Never do we really believe in the hopelessness of our hero. One can only imagine what Leonardo DiCaprio would have done with this role. DiCaprio has become in my opinion, the best American actor of his generation. As for the others, a lot of talent is left stranded. Jeff Daniels, who is capable of so much madness on screen, is like a robot and unfortunately the immense talent of Jessica Chastain boils down to close-ups of her luscious lips. For a realistic glimpse of the future of space exploration, it is a very good film. Nothing revolutionary as was '2001 ...', but very competent. The drama though, misses the target and the film is far too optimist for my taste.",7,1,5,28 October 2015
