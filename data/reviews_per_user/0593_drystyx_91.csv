The Rock," Takes the fun out of movie watching
","'The Rock' suffers most from bad writing. The script is just bad. It relies on special effects, action, and emotions from characters who the writers feel are superior to the viewer. They take all the fun out of movie viewing. The movie takes all the stock elements of routine movie making and keep the very worst ones. Whatever makes a movie less appealing, they do. The movie is meant for people already coupled, probably making it a woman's movie. Instead of boy meets girl, it copies the formula of 99% of other movies in which boy already owns girl. Its a movie designed to delight only the rich, wealthy viewer with a family. The two lead characters are impossible to like. They have superiority complexes that would even make Sly and Arnie look meek. This might pass if the movie was made as a comic farce, but it isn't. Half of the movie's dialog consists of the lines in which Connery claims 'winners', which the movie has no subtle pretense to mean 'men who can do the job, perform, survive, understand, etc', can only be men who were early childhood successes, early developers who were part of early established marriages, who were successes in high school, who had sex with the 'prom queen'. Yes, it is nonsense. Its also the most Republican propaganda ever in a movie. The viewer doesn't care if any of these characters get killed. Even if you live in the target city, you probably won't care. The plot is over the top, which is okay if the people are interesting. These aren't.",1,10,26,8 January 2007
Scarface," helped begin the decline of gangster movies
","Before 'Godfather', cops and robbers movies were exciting and entertaining. Then came the long boring gangster movies which tried to make us understand gangsters. It doesn't work. 'Scarface' suffers from lack of likable characters, lack of believable characters, lack of plot, lack of motivation, lack of a logical sequence of events, lack of fun, just a lack of everything. It is not an exciting movie. You fall asleep before you hear the action wake you up, and then you don't really care. Pacino seems only capable of portraying a pretty boy, even with a scarface, he tries to stay pretty in each scene. Its not totally his fault. The writing is pitiful. Pacino's character comes from a multitude of beautiful Latino women, and we are to believe he lusts after some middle aged looking, raggedy looking, rather pitiful looking, pale lifeless ordinary blonde? Clearly a woman wrote this part of the script. No man could ever buy into it. The plot fails, too. Pacino magically becomes a top master criminal because....well, no one knows why. Nothing is explained. Nothing makes sense. But then, the modern gangsster films are all that way. We don't understand the characters, partly because we have no idea what's going on. Just a bunch of lines, mean looks and blood and gore we actually sleep through.",1,20,41,26 December 2006
The Monuments Men," Basic message without being overly preachy
","The message here, of course, is the value of culture and art as opposed to human lives, but that's putting it simply.Clooney and company make it clear they aren't justifying murder for art's sake, or justifying the deaths of the many people who built the wall of China.A group of middle aged men, experts mostly in art, volunteer during World War II to salvage art stolen by the Nazis, some of it meant to be destroyed, much of it meant initially to be reissued as 'Nazi propaganda' with the extermination of everyone who would say otherwise, and when the war is nearly lost, obviously meant for use as a fortune stock pile for Nazis to buy their lives with.The volunteers aren't vital to any other effort of the war, and this is what they want to do. They are determined to risk only their own lives, and that is an important cog of this story.The film has poor sound quality, and you need closed captioning, so it's hard to give a high score to, but it is otherwise well directed and written, with the liberties of the facts taken not too extensive. It isn't like the crazy OK Corral stories we have gotten from Hollywood.'Culture' is not only overrated, as the characters here overrate it, but it is in fact responsible for almost all atrocities. Pol Pot even felt his sadistic Khmer Rouge was his own 'culture' and 'art'. Should that be salvaged? If Hitler won the war, and exterminated all who questioned him, the very art that was the culture for other people would be the 'art' and 'culture' of his Reich, of his Satanic cult of Nazis, virtually the hand picked most demonic of the German people. It would then be heralded as their work, and be their 'culture'. Don't think it couldn't happen.The good news is that the film doesn't preach the point to us, but only states that 'culture' and 'art' is that important to the 'monument men' who risk their lives. This is important to remember.",8,0,0,1 June 2014
Lucky Number Slevin," Stupid, trite, and waste of time
","Make no mistake, this is a formula movie, and probably the most predictable movie you will ever see. I won't spoil it, but will say that 'yes, what happens in every film in this ignorant genre, will happen again'. This movie does set a milestone. It is the first movie ever to have the poorest in writing-every single word is out of place, forced, and contrived; in acting-good actors can make something out of the worst scripts, but these actors are miserable in line delivery; and directing-since these actors have done better, it must be the direction that leaves them looking pitiful, plus the scenes don't make any logic, and yet somehow the entire movie is predictable. You soon realize they are just doing the 'formula'. What makes this movie worse than terrible is that the hero is supposed to be the everyman (such as in Hitchcock classics), but instead, you know he's some kind of super thug like the others-not only by his manner and attitude, but by the sheer logic of events. You never buy any of the characters. It is impossible to find credibility in the flirting with the two leads, the logic of accepting the huge bet, the bookie willing to take the bet to people he knows will kill him for it; I mean, there is exactly zero credibility in each situation! An audience wants adventure, but something has to be credible (usually the characters being credible make it worthwhile), but this really looks like someone wanted to enter the 'Worst Film Festival' in every category, since even the acting was horrible. And yes, this may be the worst acted film you'll ever see. There is no plot, except for revenge. And the only thing that possibly veils the story is a change in hair color for the vengeful person. We have super tough thugs who are so stereotyped, you'll have to laugh. Speaking of hair color, the director makes sure he falls into the neo-Nazi tradition of these ignorant movies by killing off at least one dark haired woman (refereing to the other neo Nazi filmmakers of USUAL SUSPECTS, GODFATHER, etc.). I'm sure most audience members get tired of the preaching and pounding these neo Nazis put into their effort. It got old decades ago. The characters are stereotypes, too, and even look more trite when the director and writer try to make them look different. It is a complete failure. No one cares about these characters, and the dialogue is so ridiculous, hack, and contrived, you wonder whether it was written by a bunch of two year olds. But everything, and I mean absolutely everything, in this movie is Hollywood formula, and will leave you feeling like you wasted a lot of time watching this trite crap.",2,4,14,10 June 2007
3:10 to Yuma," excellently done
","This was what you call an excellently done movie. First, it is a Western, and a remake of the classic Heflin film, though not the best script. What is so astonishing is how true to the original this movie is made. It does pay homage to it, and much of it is word for word, while at the same time, punctuating itself with it's own soul. Perhaps the main weakness is that this version is much more 'Hollywood', with the over the top unkillable perfect evil machines, and the total contrivance of a 'Natural power order among humans'. This part is, I admit, way too Hollywood.In the original, Heflin, one of the greatest Western actors of all time (Shane, Gunman's Walk, Stagecoach), dominated the movie with a superior performance. But lets be honest, he also had the help of excellent writing for his character. The remake alters his character somewhat, from a simple man of the era, trying to make ends meet, and retaining his dignity; into a simple man more in tune with our era. The character isn't as well written, but Bale knew he was following in gigantic footsteps, and his performance is outstanding, going above the written word so to speak. The other chief character, the charming, but deadly outlaw, was revolutionary in the time of the original, and may have been better done in other movies (Robert Ryan in 'The Naked Spur' and Barry Sullivan in '7 Ways to Sundown.) It became a trademark of the classic Western era, but still in the experimental stage. Ford was a very good actor, but he just didn't seem to cut it for this film the way some other actors did. Crowe's performance in this remake was monumental, but to be fair to the original actor, Crowe had a lot more to study from. This doesn't detract from his performance, however. I almost hate to single out Crowe's performance, although I believe it to be Oscar worthy, because everyone in the film was outstanding. This tells us not only that the casting crew deserved note, but also the director (who elicits the performances), the film editing crew (helping to make good cuts), the film crew (for making such good cuts), and actually everyone else. This was obviously a well oiled machine. I do have a gripe with the Sound, because I had to constantly adjust it, and lost much of the early dialog, but having done some film work myself, it is an ongoing joke among film people that sound people don't know what the H... they'e doing. Again, much like the original, which also had a well oiled machine, and no weak spots. A good film (in a year of some of the worst films on record), makes this a good choice for rental.",5,2,4,26 January 2008
Ghost," a lot of great scenes sign of a great movie
","This may not be a classic, but it comes close. It has one big attribute of most great movies, a lot of great scenes. The story is about Sam, who has a great life, and this movie is the opposite of CLICK. Unlike that stupid movie, this guy doesn't want to fast forward his life with a beautiful loving wife and great career. But it is taken away from him when he is killed. He becomes a ghost. And that might be one of only two flaws in the story. Why he can project his needs when billions of other dead souls can't. But a great movie like this endears us to the characters and plot enough so that this is a very trivial flaw. He finds he can communicate with a fake spiritualist (Whoopi, in a role few could do as well), which is the second flaw, since we have a feeling we've seen this character in this instance all too often. Hoever, again, if the movie is good enough we can overlook this. Without making spoilers, I can only add that the movie satisfies the viewer. There is romance, humor, logic, adventure, suspense, and great scenes. Among the great scenes that make the movie (I'll only mention some) are the scene where Sam follows his friend to the killer's apartment (actually just about every scene with his friend is classic), the scene where Whoopi goes to the bank, the scene where she leaves the bank, the scene where Sam is a ghost in the office with his friend, the scene where the friend hits on Sam's woman, the first scene with the little dark men, the second scene with the little dark men...I could go on and on. What is lost in all of this is one of the greatest emotional bits of capturing character ever, when Sam realizes what is going to happen to an evil man when the little dark men appear the second time, and he expresses true sorrow and compassion for a man who stole so much from him. This is one of the most poignant and heroic scenes ever in any movie I would find it very hard to believe anyone could not enjoy this movie. Truly a winner. Know what? This is a classic.",10,20,23,13 May 2007
Spartacus," I change my mind, I'm not Spartacus
","This film is entertainment. It is very broad and lenient with facts. But why not? No one really knows a lot about a guy who lived 2000 centuries ago. Scholars can't even agree on Jesus, and he had more identified eye witnesses than any character before the printing press. Spartacus leads a rebellion against Rome composed of gladiators. How they are initially formed is hypothetical. Once you get several hundred, it is easy to recruit more and more, however. It isn't a spoiler to say Spartacus eventually gets caught, but not before he has several victories. In this, the film is pretty accurate. Kirk Douglas isn't the epitome of Spartacus. Most gladiators who were slaves from conquered lands were from the East, and would be darker than the Romans, who had a lot of blonde and fair citizens at the time. Their dark skin and hair really evolved later when they began intermingling with what they called the 'Orientals'. However, some slaves were from the North, so it isn't beyond possibility. Douglas doesn't seem large enough, however, to be a leader of gladiators. One would expect a towering figure to be Spartacus. That said, this has a lot of adventure and intrigue. Most of the story deals with Spartacus as an alien force, focusing more on two factions of Roman citizens trying to win control of Rome. Of course, one must mention the famous line, when the gladiators are caught, and Spartacus is told to identify himself. I doubt that when the film was made that they realized this scene would become one of the ten greatest known of all time. A fun movie.",7,0,4,15 May 2007
Gravity," Less than meets the eye
","This is a 'lost in space' style story, with the theme being on the isolation and helplessness of the character.Aside from a few 'voices' and 'corpses', there are only two characters here, and pretty much just one.That's okay. It makes this more of a stage play set in outer space, but with some action replacing dialog.This has always been big with directors, to have just one or two characters. The problem is that if you just develop one or two characters, you better use the hour or more of developing to do a fantastic job, because there's no excuse otherwise.The character development falls very flat, and honestly a good writer could do this much in a ten minute short story.That's not to say it's a bad film. It is watchable, the story is good enough, and the director succeeds in an obvious, although somewhat expository attempt at showing the reality of floating in Space.The 'reality' theme of space is efficient, but also looks contrived to fit an agenda, contrived to fit the scenario.Not as contrived as most Hollywood movies, however.The acting is sub par. Two huge names, but little talent. This would have been much better with two completely unknown theater majors or graduates who were more theater and less Hollywood, because the director obviously wanted this to be 'more theater and less Hollywood', but the acting foiled any chance this had to be spectacular.A lot of it is poor dialog. Very 'formula' dialog, which is okay if you're going 'Hollywood' or 'James Bond', but not if you're attempting reality Drama.The premise is good, the logistics work well, and technically this is fine, and it isn't a total waste. It just isn't anything more than a very definitive 6/10.",6,0,1,19 April 2016
Lone Survivor," Good movie, a few nit picks
","Obviously, when based on truth, especially a very modern truth, with characters still having survivors, a story may have many sides.Except in the case of the demon possessed Taliban monsters. There really is only one side here.There are gray areas. Such as how to deal with prisoners and civilians. JUNGLE FIGHTERS explored this for WWII quite well. PLATOON showed a scary side of uncertainty in Viet Nam.Here, we get more of the uncertainty of modern warfare.A small team of well trained soldiers go on a mission to eliminate a human monster that the world would obviously be better off without.The plan goes awry because of a compromised situation.The story is well told, and I believe told quite credibly. When the four soldiers are outnumbered, you will probably be like me and hope they all get out, despite the title, and kill all the nut jobs out there, because you know those nut jobs make life miserable even more for the local people.And we get insight into that, which is good.A lot is good with this film, and well done.A few nit picks I have.First, I found it easier to understand the Farsi speakers than the Americans. Whether it was sound quality or just horrible enunciation from the actors, I have no idea what any of the Americans said for the entire first half of the film. I would walk out if I didn't plan to critique it.Fortunately, the rest of the film made up for it.Second, I learned some Farsi from Pimsleur tapes and a book, though never practiced in real life to real people, and even I could understand and communicate better than the soldier among the villagers. One would think he would at least know to say 'chaghu' for 'knife', and 'motoshakerim' (which I always remember by saying 'Moto Shack Harem'), and to understand the simple 'Taliban nist'.Unbelievable that the soldier couldn't understand any of this, but then he was horribly wounded, but then it should have been made clear that this was the reason he didn't understand. I can't comprehend that simple Farsi wouldn't be taught to an elite unit.Third, and lastly, the soldier should have known that the villagers weren't hostile, I guess because the villager kept saying 'Taliban Nist', and thought he was a little crazy during that time.These are mere nit picks on a good film. Thumbs up.",6,0,0,7 December 2015
Fury," A few theatrics to emphasize the bigger picture
","This war film set in Germany during World War II succeeds on all levels, and I think it was meant to do so.In order to do that, we get a few theatrics in the form of what appear to be coincidences, but in actuality aren't so coincidental.The theatrics of this tank being the only one to survive a big blow out battle of tanks is simply the result of one tank surviving. It happens to be this one. When one takes that into consideration, one realizes there is nothing really special about the five man crew or its commander.After that, we get a lot of realism and gore on the order of Private Ryan. What this and Ryan do that other war films don't do, is simply relate the gore without either glorifying it or reveling in it. We don't get immediate results of death, but we don't get the modern era reveling of seeing how long a burning human can scream either. It's all done on a relatively realistic scale.And that's what makes this action war film on a par with Ryan. In really has no more coincidences in it than Ryan does, a film that bends over backwards to save anyone from New York or California, magically unable to be hit by bullets, as Hollywood likes to do, However, the end game does have the cliché of 'order of deaths' pretty much down, but one coincidence is to be expected in a melee of violence.The characters are probably even better than Ryan's characters. There are obvious similarities, whether on purpose or not, who knows? Sometimes a script may linger in a writer's mind for decades before it's penned, so there's no sense in trying to make too much of that. Certainly better than the cartoon cutouts of movies like Big Red One and Bastards.A mixture of many war film elements should satisfy everyone, and this passes all the tests. Will it pass the test of time? Have to wait 100 years to find out.",8,7,12,21 July 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Is it possible to make a movie worse than this?
","This fantasy war movie looks like a group of people got together and did the Zero Mostel-Gene Wilder-Dick Shawn approach, hoping to make the worst possible movie, not taking into account the dorks that latch onto the worst possible movie.It defies description with how predictable and full of clichés it is. Worse yet, it defies description as to how contrived it is, looking like 'we're so mad we aren't going to take it any more', in a world where this very concept is the very thing sane people are sick of.It's full of hatred. It's violence Hollywood style, meant to make people think that some men are gods, so it goes over well with the losers and bubble boys who live in cubicles, hoping that some men are gods who can kill thousands of people just by talking tough.It's pathetic, really. It honestly looks like a two year wrote this, and a three year old directed it.",2,8,12,12 January 2013
The Hunger Games," A bit trite, but they try
","Another take off on Battle Royale here, the fight to the death, ten little Indians with one or two survivors thing.It doesn't matter why they do it in these spectacles, because obviously there can be no justification for such a 'game'.It's pretty mundane to say 'killing is bad', because those of us who think the 'kill' mentality of games is immature and sick, those who are the beaver and butt heads who get off on it will get off on these kind of movies just as much, unless they are shown for what they are, and the characters are shown for what they are.That's why Battle Royale worked so well, and why The Condemned failed, because the Condemned was simply a neo Nazi propaganda movie for the sick human demons of society.This one works fairly well, although we get lost in a bit of drag, mostly due to confusing camera work, and due to drawing out scenes too much.Plus, the idea has been run into the ground. This movie really offers little new.The maniac played by Sutherland is without motivation, but honestly, he is a grown up beaver and butt head. We have seen many people who worship the lack of motivation, and they are now adults in positions of power, the same nerds and geeks who praised their own inept superiority in their virtual worlds.So the maniac ruler works well in this, and is believable. Some who might question him feel insecure and threatened if they speak up.Some of what happens is a bit predictable. It's actually the heroics of the heroine that are most credible in this.",6,0,2,18 January 2015
The 13th Warrior," not a sit down and watch movie
","This movie is an adventure tale involving an Arab who joins 12 Vikings on a sort of 'mythic quest', to which they believe there will be a logical reason. The characters are not overly believable, but not overly trite, either. The Arab comes across the most believable. They belief in logic, and the modernism of morality doesn't really fit into the middle age world and mentality. You would think they had all read the philosophers and writers of the nineteenth and twentieth century. The movie tries to be a thought provoking piece, a mystery, and an adventure all rolled into one. Where it fails to completely enthrall us is in the super slow pace to which the mystery is even brought up. As a result, it just drones on, without any real interest. It has some nice scenes, and fits in well with modern cinema which is based on having a few 'cinematic' moments, and a few tough lines. It could be the 'Pulp Fiction' of the Middle Ages. But it just isn't a film a person can sit down, watch, and enjoy. It neither captivates the spirit of adventure, or the spirit of atmospheric Mystery. But it still has some bright spots.",6,0,1,6 September 2008
The Mummy," fun, but forgettable
","The story of a mummy works very well in old films, because the mummy is a wrapped up figure, whose reanimation is scary because of the bleakness and strangeness of the world beyond life.Here, film makers make the mistake of trying to make it 'Indiana Jones' adventure. It's pretty good, and it's fairly fun, but it's so predictable, and so cliché, it's hard to enjoy even for fun.Still, it is watchable. It just isn't as exciting as watching to watch constant barrages of mindlessness, that are full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, as it is to watch the creeping mummy stalk those who dare to soil the tomb of the dead with their Science.A week later, you won't remember much more than a few smirks on the lead actor's face.It's just not very exciting.",4,0,2,24 August 2012
Constantine," Pathetic
","This film has no plot. It has no characters. It is mere gibberish. It is more proof that film makers know that all they need to do is establish a few high octane action scenes with lots of pizzaz in the previews to get audiences, knowing full well that a few crackheads will be in awe of the comical camera shots, with the quick ignorant cuts and zooms for no reason, except to confuse the viewer. The more naive viewers will be fooled, much like the emperor with no clothes. More than anything, this is a cigarette commercial. Anyone even resembling a romantic male character must smoke cigarettes constantly. It is not even subtle. It is 'in your face' smoke the whole movie. In fact, it is not possible to watch this movie without feeling like your choking to death, unless you're a right wing cigarette fanatic. Aside from that, nothing makes sense. Nothing is explained, and to top it all off, the characters can't speak coherently. Illegal immigrants speak better English than these drama school rejects. Horribly directed, horribly scripted, horribly acted. Nothing to like. Hard to see anyone rating this garbage over a '1'.",2,0,5,25 October 2008
Troy," this is good and fresh, a true remake
","In fact, while I initially rate it an 8 overall, I may raise the rating. i rarely rate a movie with a 10 immediately. It has to sink in.That said, this story is the Iliad, with little amendments here and there, and yet, it is still the most faithful to Homer's original. Yet, the clever rewrite makes it superior.The Iliad was originally about the disagreement between Agammemon and Achilles. The former is portrayed true to form. He is supposed to be a cruel, stubborn character. So is Achilles. This movie is actually the truest to the book, of all the movies.The clever rewriting gives a good look at the war, and gives a credible account, even more credible than the poem of old. And who really knows what the original story was, since it was changed so many times before being put to print. And various generations would fit in their own versions to suit the rulers of the time. After all, it was to rulers that bards sang.For those who don't know, Troy is ruled by Priam, whose oldest son, Hector, is a valiant fighter, and his younger son, Paris, a lady's man. Paris absconds with the wife of Meneleus, Helen of Troy, which sends the Greeks to Ilium (Troy), which most people assume to be Turkey.Now this is a romanticized reason. And the real reasons for war were supposed to be for monetary trade reasons (probably spices). At any rate, other more realistic reasons are given in the movie.But the movie is more than just the war. It explores the characters much better than Homer ever did. We think of Homer as a great poet, but in truth, he (or they, since Homer is considered to be more than one poet) is overrated. The characters are quite identifiable, and they draw us into this world of war.The acting and directing is stellar. Pitt actually reminds a viewer of Crowe, and he gives a subtle, but unmistakeably great acting job. In fact, this is made possible because the entire cast is superb. And in such a case, one must credit the director and editors, too. An all around top job by the entire crew.The movie is long, but not boring. It quickly flows from action to action, from consequence to consequence.I didn't think I would like this movie. This was an excellent movie. It is a true remake, because it adds elements of its own to make a story we can accept, believe, and watch.Big thumbs up.",10,3,5,8 March 2008
Cloverfield," disjointed, which was the point.
","This movie had the point of view of a video camera, so it is disjointed. This, of course, is the point. It is also an excuse for sloppy film making. I can live with that.The story benefits from never really explaining where the monster came from or what it is. It is very reminiscent of a nightmare one might have. It is an unfeeling, noise making monster just bent on destruction.We never really get into the characters, but they do seem to work together fairly well, and are likable enough. They are superior to the cardboard cut outs of the usual delinquents and absolute video arcade characters we usually get. They seem to have genuine feelings, and no unexplained hostility that we get all too often.It revolves around New York City, and seems to dwell on that, even to a chauvinistic effect, so it does turn off non New Yorkers. Not a good idea, as New Yorkers are not close to the majority of the world population.It also seems to have little monsters with the big monster. Not much sense, but at least the movie doesn't try to explain it. We are simply on the ride, so to speak.Helicopter crashes are almost always fatal, so the credibility factor dropped a notch, but not enough to really hurt.All in all, this movie is an in between sort. Not great, not bad. It takes chances, and has some assets. Probably better than most crap produced by the morons in the industry. These people have some sense. It would rate higher if it was more interesting. Still, not a bad movie.",3,0,0,28 June 2008
The Hateful Eight," The way Hollywood geeks want it to be
","This is an aptly named Western, as we learn there are eight hateful characters involved, although the one played by Kurt Russell isn't really hateful, just experienced.It's another of those Hollywood geek movies, made for the geeks who worship 'Hate' and Satanic ideology. The difference, however, is that again Tarantino pokes fun at the very dorks who love this sort of propaganda.It's a bit of a comic sneer at the hate filled spaghetti Westerns. Tarantino does sneer at his own fans, it's obvious. And who can blame him? Again, we will hear all the Beavis and Butthead, brain dead, pothead, meth head, loud mouth brats insist this is the real West, but it isn't. These characters wouldn't last long in the real West, but the brats will never want to believe that.It's a story of people who just think their demonic ideology enables them to be supermen, which is what Hollywood turned into after about 1965.Still, with Tarantino, you get a few chuckles, so it isn't as bad as most modern movies.But it's still worthless.",3,2,7,6 December 2017
We Were Soldiers," Well done battle film
","I am not a Gibson fan. He often appears in contrived plots and trite themes, but he is one of the best actors of this age. Here, he gives a superior performance, which, of course, also means the other actors also gave superior performances, and the direction and editing was superb.The story is about a battle at the beginning of U.S. involvement in Viet Nam. The story is nonjudgmental, and goes out of its way to be neutral. It is obviously anti-war, and depicts higher ups in a poor light, but the poor light is justified by being accurate, and well depicted in a way we can understand.It is a different style of war film. It has elements of the old war film, in which we see some camaraderie among soldiers in an isolated situation, along with the families at home who wait for news, and it has elements of the new war film, in which we see some of the politics involved in decisions higher up.It is high in action, and not many dull moments. We begin with the introduction of characters, the training, and the family lives of the soldiers, then we get into high gear with combat, and the combat is brutal. One officer leads his men into an ill advised chase of an enemy scout to capture him (his men must've been wondering why they couldn't have been told to shoot the enemy in the leg to capture him) and get cut off.We really see most characters come and go, but the film does follow 5 Americans in battle pretty well, one of them who does leave this world. One of the five is a reporter who makes the film a little weaker. By any definition, he is a moron, going into the heat of battle with no adequate explanation, except for his inner feeling of superiority. Without this character, the film could've ranked a 10 instead of a 9. But if he was there, he was there.Well done war film that takes no sides.",7,2,3,11 January 2010
The Beach," Dork Beach
","'Dork Beach' wold have been the perfect title for this movie. A dork, by definition is a polar opposite of a nerd, someone so afraid of being uncool that every decision is based upon what other people think, which of course makes them the most uncool of characters. This movie centers on characters that would fit right in with Barney Fife and Ted Baxter. A young guy, who we learn later is the dork of dorks, has a map to a supposed Paradise on an Asian island, and he goes there with a Frenchman and the Frenchman's girlfriend. The Frenchmand, by the way is one of the only two characters with an IQ over 10. The other one is an unsavory sort who warns the dorks (an unheeded warning) that just because the super dork killed a five foot shark, don't take his goofy babble, about being one with nature and commanding all sharkdom, seriously. The three young people take a high dive into water they don't know the depth of. In real life a best case scenario would be instant death, but more likely hitting a rock, being paralyzed, and dying in anguish. This reason alone would make this movie unwatchable. Before that, they go bananas over a marijuana field in such a way that you see many people do, the kind of people who worship Cheeck and Chong, the kind you never really believe are that excited, but merely hide their true emotions with goofy babble. Then they find the field is guarded by gun toting locals. After the dive they come across some of the ugliest people you ever saw. Just physically repulsive. Island life does not show well on most Caucasians. The ugliest woman in the world is the leader. She's almost as mean as she is ugly. She has no leadership qualities, no charisma, nothing. Yet people attack on her command. The trio isn't there twenty seconds before the rut gut ugly woman tells them they can't leave. Of course, that is kidnapping, and an older guy would immediately slit her throat and the throats of everyone else who kept him from leaving, because this place is clearly some kind of Hell, and there is no saving grace to it. None! No appeal at all, unless you were to run off the dorks. Its hard to imagine even kids accepting this, but maybe that's the way the filthy rich spoiled types think. And these are all filthy rich spoiled types, richer than anyone you probably ever met. (They had the money to gallivant across the globe nonchalantly.) One of the trio thinks he is forced to make love to Miss Super Ugly, and you'd feel sorry for him if it wasn't for the fact that her blackmail didn't make sense. Add to this the fact that the marijuana growers know this group of pompous pot smokers is there smoking up their profits, and are undoubtedly thinking of a way to control the business for themselves, and you have a laughable scenario. They might let some vagabonds stay there, or some poor locals, or some retired people, or anyone who has no interest in the marijuana. But to believe they'd let the people most likely to snitch, crowd them out, and take over their business, is impossible to believe under any circumstances. These dorks would have been eliminated from the game of life two seconds after they were discovered. The only saving grace is that the movie does show that the kids are dorks, and the place is a Hell. Still, the plot lacks any semblance of credibility, even in the world of Fantasy.",2,5,10,20 January 2007
MASH," much different than TV series
","The best way to evaluate 'Mash' is to compare it to the TV series. While the names are mostly the same, otherwise the two are quite different. On many levels the movie works better. On first glance, the TV series is more entertaining and seems to have the edge. The movie is choppy and has a badly edited look. The anti war sentiment is more hinted at than the series, in which war is heavily lambasted. The movie also deals more with the Korean War. Historically, the movie shows much more accuracy. While the TV series specialized in old wartime stories all combined in one setting, the movie was much more real, with no set agenda or divine intelligence wrapping up all the troubles of the world. The movie deals with an ongoing struggle of the characters with no end in sight. The mud and gloom is well depicted, and has more accuracy. For example, during the Korean War, medical information was not as well coordinated between cultures. The modern day Discovery Planet viewer would have more knowledge of poisonous Asian snakes than the best trained American Mash surgeon. This was before the information age. The movie indicates this, while the TV series would have the surgeons miraculously draw inspiration from colorful local characters, probably the least honest ones, to arrive at a cure for the most poisonous of snakes. The movie also dealt better with the characters. Hot Lips, for instance, was a much more believable character in the movie, and much more likable. She had more of a naive innocent acceptance of the American dream common to that era, and Sally Kellerman was a much more attractive character in all respects. The TV Hot Lips was probably the woman most men would vote for as the 'woman men would care about least if she died' award. She was hateful and mean spirited beyond all compassion, particularly to those weaker and lower on the totem pole than her. The movie Hot Lips was not nearly so harsh. All the characters were more drawn to the middle than in the series. The series drew its humor from stereotyping the characters, until they introduced their most complex character, Dr. Winchester, to the show. While this would be considered low brow cheap humor, it did make th show much funnier than the movie. Another note is that the movie should be with parental guidance for one reason alone. In one landmark scene, a man with a beautiful voice sings 'Suicide is Painless'. While this is meant as an ironic statement, it should be made clear to more naive viewers that suicide statistically creates more troubles, since about half of the attempts are botched and cause scars or crippling. The lone exception would be in cases such as war when a botched attempt may keep a person from being forced to walk in a land mine field, but this wasn't the case with the doctors. The anti war sentiments were more Viet Nam in the series, more Korea in the movie. And in both cases, it is a timeless sentiment. The movie never really gives the viewer the feel of death and dismemberment, of amputations and bodily ruin. There is a lack of emotion and expression which doesn't help to make the case for the movie. Most of the characters look alike, and it makes it hard to distinguish what they are feeling. On this level, the movie doesn't make it. A huge flaw is the preachy anti Christian attitude. The character of Burns is depicted as praying for people diligently, then hypocritically hurting people. I've known dozens of people who pray diligently and read the bible diligently, and none of them have ever been hypocrites. One hundred percent of them are caring people who bend over backwards to help others. This characterization is a sick stereotype that doesn't even exist in real life. Makes you wonder about the wackos who invented the character. Don't expect great entertainment or laughs. It isn't a thrilling or exciting movie, and may even put you to sleep. But it has merits.",2,1,6,31 January 2007
Life of Pi," 'Perception' in modern day Liberty Valence story
","This can be viewed as a modern day Liberty Valance film, and I don't think that is specific enough to be a spoiler.It's also a story of 'perception'.It's a slow paced film, which usually only works when the characters are credible.The characters aren't 'credible' here, but that might work because all but two of the characters are told from the point of view of a sole ship wreck survivor.The trouble is that the second of the two characters not told from his point of view, a writer, is not credible. We learn this at the end when he immediately has a revelation of truth that could only come from piecing a puzzle together.The writer character is poorly written for this reason. His immediate understanding of a puzzle is like a man reading a cryptogram and not even looking at all the letters, but solving it immediately, the first letter, then second, and so forth, in a normal cryptogram puzzle.Despite this, the story itself has its merits. Another problem is that we sit too long through the two characters droning on in a very dull way. Not that they're dull, but just that they aren't interesting. And it takes too long to get to the 'story' part.I understand that a background is set up for the 'point of view' of the sole survivor of a ship wreck, but this background part fails, or at least gets a 'D' grade, for being overly long, when it could be just as well described in seconds by a good writer. Also, the character of the story teller doesn't seem credible for his background.The story teller explains himself in an Agnostic way, and a way that questions everything he sees. And we get this effect in the first story he tells. In the second story, however, he questions nothing, and his description of at least one character looks suspiciously made up.The dynamic part of the story could also have been better. There are some good cinematic touches, but this is very slow paced.What does bring this film up a level is the psychology of 'survivor' stories. If one ever reads accounts by survivors of battles, wars, disasters, one sees pretty much a common element. The survivor almost never describes himself as nice, and in fact, almost all survivors try to describe themselves as harsh, tough, and a survivor because of natural selection.We do see that in the survival story here, in a good allegorical way. We also see that the survival story is told in such a way that we feel the survivor does perceive the events in 'flash photo' form, which affects his perception of reality. Those aspects are well done.It's too bad that is about all that was done well. It's a good idea, but just not well written.",6,1,2,1 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Extremely watchable
","This is the story of Captain America. Comic book super hero of World War II, told in golden age comic book and golden age film style.There is a lot to like, and about nothing to dislike.The characters are very interesting, if you excuse the Laugh In reference.Our hero begins as a 90 pound weakling, and in an interesting turn around, the man he begins as a sidekick for, that man later becomes his famous sidekick, Bucky. Does Bucky die in this movie? Well, I'm not going to spoil that. We know he dies in some Captain America story. It doesn't have to be this one. Just not saying.The Red Skull will remind you of the famous 007 nemesis in many ways.We also get introduced to another group of Marvel heroes familiar to golden age comic book fans. Their introduction passes the theatrical test, and is well done.There is an Indiana Jones humor attached to this that works quite well, too. Some of my favorite bits are during the 'sideshow' parts, which are more than extremely watchable. Full of dancing girls showing their legs, and one especially hilarious bit with an actor portraying Hitler trying to sneak up on Captain America as part of the performance.Thumbs up.",7,0,1,26 June 2012
Fargo," this is not entertainment
","This is nearly impossible to sit through. It is a dull, plodding story with contrived situations that aren't even comical. There is no saving grace. But I finally sat through a showing to critique, and it could be used as a diagram of how not to make a movie for male audiences who aren't die hard Nazi party members. It's supposed to be about a blotched kidnapping of William Macy's wife, and one of the two men who did it is a psychopathic lunatic. To appease the females, and grab the large Nazi audience of the U.S., the director chose to contrive the plot so to kill any woman with hair darker than complete blonde. Women love movies that do this, since they like to imagine a world with less competition. And women usually make the choice of what movie to see in a household. The acting is horrid, too. They try to do the accent of Hoosiers and people further West, but real people enunciate much better. The accents are horrible, and show incompetence. But that is minor compared to the complete contrivance of the movie. Total flop.",1,6,18,13 December 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," improvement on book, which is saying a lot
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy has always been a mainstay for the creative and artistic crowd, and for the hippies of a bygone era. It has risen to a level more prominent than the books themselves, into icon status, and it did this long before the movies. Indeed, Tolkien wasn't the greatest writer, but he did invent a world, and he is the prototype for such worlds, like it or not. He is the Moses of Elfland, so to speak. He wrote their bible. The Fellowship movie is probably the most interesting of the trilogy, because it gives such an in depth viewpoint of the characters. More than the book, the director manages to let the viewer know what each character is thinking and doing in nearly every instance. Considering the amount of high action and adventure, this is a stunning accomplishment. The cutaways and little slices where the camera turns to hobbit or elf or dwarf or orc, is expertly done, and this is possibly the best directed film of all time as a result. The plot is action. It involves a lowly character and his companions in a quest to save the world. Unlikely plot, and unlikely creatures, but a movie relies on likely characters, which this movie has. A great thrill ride.",10,1,4,12 July 2007
The Caine Mutiny," Excellent acting in Strawberry growers' movie
","This film about a fictional U.S. mutiny, and the events before and after, strongly illustrates a few vital points that makes 'old' movies superior to most people, or at least to people who want to enjoy movies. First, the acting. Humphrey Bogart was the tough guy of the movies, Yet here, he breaks down, he gets confused, he shows some forms of cowardice depending upon your point of view. Would De Niro take such a role today? He would rewrite the script to make the captain an ogre, but never a coward or confused. And I pick De Niro because he has proved an ability to act. He can do it, but doesn't. The characters make this movie, and they're all believable characters. And the movie makes some points. The viewer can choose if the points are valid, but the film makes an obvious stand. The film was also obviously a commercial for the Strawberry Farmers of that time. They undoubtedly had a hand in the production. There is no way that every single officer on board a ship would like strawberries. Very few people can stand them. A hundred years earlier, when Vitamin C was scarce on long voyages, there would obviously be a deficiency in the body which would prompt someone to eat these sour, horrible tasting things, but not in the U.S. military of the post World War Two era. This isn't an action packed movie. It is more of a drama, and it is well written, and well acted.",9,0,2,19 March 2007
The Thing," even if you don't like it, you'll be mesmerized
","This is one of those movies that even if you aren't a die hard fan of it, you'll still find it hard to turn away from. It is hard macho action and hard macho science fiction, and it does Carpenter a lot of justice I dare say. The old version of the Thing had an appeal to it, but so does this one. And this one I dare say has a lot of grit and excitement to it. The premise is an isolated Arcitc (or is it Antarctic? Who cares)) science team finds a frozen alien and inadvertently bring it back to life. In this version the 'Thing' is very high on the evolutionary scale, and very tough to deal with. Each cell can act on its own, but also must respond to the other cells. I know it doesn't make sense, but it makes for one *$#* of an adversary you don't want to tangle with. It eats you and then copies your DNA so that it becomes an exact replica of you with even your memories. How can you beat something like that? Well, Kurt Russell finds a why. He drinks vodka at it! And then he gets flame throwing units to burn it. But which people are real and which are 'things'? You see the dilemma. And the script plays it for all its worth, and I dare say it plays it very well. An exciting thrill ride. The characters ring fairly true, and Carpenter, as usual, does his characters much better than most directors. I could nit pick at one flaw. It didn't ring true when a certain character froze and refused to burn up a thing, who even in human form was abusive toward s him. There's my one nit pick. Not bad for over a dozen characters in a full length film. If only other directors and writers could keep it down to one nit pick. There is a question at the end, as to whether one of the survivors might be a 'thing.' A good ambiguous ending, and enhanced by good selection of music. I think the sound effects unit deserves much praise for this film. The first time I watched it, and I've reinforced that opinion over later watchings, I thought the vodka drank by the characters at the end proved they weren't things, since alcohol kills individual cells, and the 'thing' would not be able to tolerate it. Indeed, I believe the alien had to have a stronger weakness than just fire, or it would have taken over much easier. It did have to choose hosts that were alcohol free, because since it couldn't drink liquor, it might be found it too easily. And yes, there are no women in this movie. Which makes you feel like your watching an old war movie. Must say it is very exciting, and very mesmerizing.",6,1,2,24 April 2007
The Village," Good movie, part easy to guess (but in good way), part surprising
","I don't believe anyone could dislike this movie. It has a soft style, and is directed and written with an emphasis on 'Twist', with a logical sequence which keeps the viewer guessing, but informed. It is probably best described as an actual horror movie, but not one of those ho hum slasher movies of which there are so many it is hard not to be numb to them. Instead, this relies on acting, story telling, writing, and directing, and I dare say it succeeds admirably. In an isolated village (and the viewer keeps wondering why it is isolated, and that is explained little by little), the elders warn the younger members that there are hostile creatures in the forest which won't bother them as long as they stay in the village. There are secrets kept by the elders, but also secrets by some younger people. The writer, director, and others involved in the movie, knew most of us would guess right on the secrets of the elders quite early, so they provided another surprise that was harder to guess at involving the younger generation. On reflection, the viewer is left to wonder whether this was the end result of the decisions of the elders or it would have happened anyway. To say more may spoil the movie, but it has a lot of messages, and a lot of entertainment value, and it is scary in parts, and the characters are all valid and likable (to some extent). I'd be very surprised if someone didn't like this movie. Very well done.",9,1,1,6 November 2006
Pitch Black," unique HOMBRE in outer space movie with style enough to cover flaws
","This is a very unique science fiction movie. It involves a spacecraft crashed on a planet with hostile life forms, some sort of birds that just cut people to shreds. It involves the characters who have to rely on a fairly interesting and definitive anti hero to help them. This could be called the HOMBRE of outer space movies. The chief character, Riddick, now appears a lot, and makes a very good anti hero. He is not vicious, just a survivor. He couldn't be more unlike the ridiculous characters of spaghetti Westerns who don't make a bit of sense. He is more akin to John Russell of HOMBRE. In fact, this movie's style is based on its strength of character development. There is a lot of action, and the characters are extremely credible, even if the plot is somewhat flimsy. But that's okay, because this is a movie which puts real people in an unbelievable situation, which is far superior to a movie which puts unbelievable people in a believable situation.",7,0,0,13 May 2007
The Shining," more assets than liabilities, a fun film
","First, I'll try a synopsis of this movie. That isn't easy, because there are basically three points of view throughout. A writer takes a job overseeing a desolate hotel, which for some reason is completely isolated during the winter, with no one around. He, his beautiful wife, and his troubled young son are all alone in a haunted hotel. The people who leave him there seem to know it is haunted, too. The writer, we learn later, is trouble, too. The film is purposely ambiguous as to whether he arrived deranged, or whether the ghosts he meets drive him to insanity. Some will like the chilling scenes. It is a fun movie, and it is scary. Others will not like some of the ambiguity, nor the fact that the writer seems to go crazy all at once. However, a second look shows that he may not have come unhinged in one second. The tell tale scene is when his wife finds part of his manuscript to see what he has written. It denotes that he has been crazy for some time. The young son is trouble, but 'gifted', with some ability to sense hauntings. For some reason, this makes him a sort of target. Why? Probably more for effect than actual cause. To accept the premise of the movie, you need to accept the premise that the ghosts are the result of some actual intelligence, and that this intelligence is some evil of the usual Hollywood undying evil sort. A lot of interesting scenes make this movie enjoyable enough. It has mixed reviews, but overall, it has many more assets than liabilities.",7,0,1,26 February 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Nothing likable about this movie at all
","It's hard to find nothing to like about a movie, but there's nothing good about this one. The first movie was bad enough, and it served as an excuse for bullies to try to invite people over and try to force them to watch it. I'm not sure what they get out of it. I just know they do it. The films are horribly written movies about machines coming back from the future to destroy a guy who is supposed to be all that and a box of cracker jacks. He isn't. In this movie, he's a brat to beat all brats, even for a kid. You just hope he gets killed and the movie ends. None of the characters are likable. The idea of time travel to change the future could be done better than in this movie series by a two year old kid. There's a lot of noise that passes for action, but the action is shot in such a way that you don't really know what's going on. This is how not to make a movie. Too bad you can't vote negative numbers for junk like this. If you haven't seen it, believe me, you aren't missing a thing.",1,15,108,10 March 2007
Duck Soup," least of Marx brothers movies still a good movie
","This is obviously the least of the Marx Brothers movies. However, it is still funny, but without the gut busting laughter of their other movies. It is very toned downed, not in antics, but in the elaboration of the antics. The brothers say and do some silly things, but the building up to the next silly thing is missing. In their classic movies, they cleverly go from one antic to the next in perfect harmony. The harmony is missing, here. The humor is still good, however. The plot involves a zany nation much like the later 'The Mouse That Roared', with lots of zany actions. People who only see this Marx Brothers movie shouldn't judge the others by this one. They are famous for movies in which they look like all out blitz defenses. This is more of a prevent defense at the end of a game. If you watch their other movies, you'll note you're attacked with clever gag on gag, endlessly, and it is hard to catch a breath. In this movie, they seem to struggle more and try to do formula humor, which they are good at. The Marx Brothers were the most gifted comics of all time (arguably).",6,1,4,2 February 2007
The Usual Suspects," total of all stereotypes in formula routine film with no assets
","Lets see. There's a kaiser who is considered a real bad ass because he gunned down his wife and little kids. Real macho, yes? He doesn't exist, but he does? He can't be killed (like we haven't seen this before). His imagination and creativity are so bad he can't even come up with names or stories, but has to take them off of coffee cups and posters. Add to this, the entire story. He orders a police line up, but the police don't know who ordered the line up. Now, we all know most police departments are incompetent, but this belongs on the NAKED GUN series. Then there are the characters. According to the narrator, they can't be broken, because they are hoodlums. Talk about your street myth that people in power would love to have you believe! But it doesn't wash. It isn't even remotely credible. And no one cares. I happen to be watching it while working on something else, and was in a public place where they showed it twice. I naturally assumed it was some sort of 'Worst films' festival, which it might have been. I was stunned to see it ranked so high on any critic's list. Now, for the reality. That was the surface appearance on first viewing. The writers claim it's just fluff, but it doesn't make a bit of sense as noir.It makes complete sense as a supernatural thriller, though. It will take a few viewings to realize that the original line up of suspects had a replacement, just as Wargrave replaced one of his victims in Ten Little Indians. The fifth 'suspect' is actually Keaton's girl friend, and we get clues from the clandestine meetings they have. The ending tells us that they actually played with the devil, and tried to make a contract to outwit him. The 'five suspects' are the five who dared to challenge the devil's turf, and the clues are there, but so subtle that the entire team of writers, director, everyone, failed to see them.",7,26,43,23 May 2007
Resident Evil," Takes the fun out of movie watching
","This is a throwback to the movies of the late sixties and seventies, which were meant to take the fun out of movie watching. It reverts to the old Nazi standard of Hollywood in which any woman with dark hair and any man with fair hair must die, and the Nazi ideal of the blonde woman and brunette male live. The movie bends over backwards in its Nazi idealism, and it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so trite and predictable. We get this 99 time out of a hundred, and it is dull, and it just isn't fun for anyone who isn't a Nazi. Can't say much about the plot. There is none. Can't say much about the acting. There is none. Can't say much about the characters. They are one dimensional cardboard stereotypes. Can't say anything good about the writing or directing. Total bomb. And depressing, too.",1,1,12,31 October 2008
No Country for Old Men," director takes you on snipe hunt-you are the fool for watching this, sorry
","I've heard older men talk about the famous 'snifpe hunt', where they take an unsuspecting naive person into the woods with a sack to wait for snipes, but none show up. Well, welcome to the snipe hunt. The entire cast, writers, director, all of them are laughing at everyone who watches this mesh. There is nothing poignant or deep here. It is just a mess. It began as a book, and to be honest, the book and movie are actually a 'spoiled brat remake', or 'modernist Beavis and Butthead version' of the classic NIGHTFALL. As near as one can make out, every major character has many guns. One finds all kinds of money, and magically everyone knows where everyone else is all the time. Now some of this is explained by a bugging device, but somehow everyone knows who everyone else is. Despite all the bloodshed, this still manages to plod on in complete boredom, which reminds one of the worst decade in film history, the seventies.All this because some hate filled bubble boy didn't like NIGHTFALL. So, we still have the lady's man who finds the money and is pursued by killers, one of whom is a maniac who pretends to make the assassinations a game of chance, and the other a saner man who resents him, and we have the addition of the 'investigator who is in over his head'. Jones takes the part once handled by Gregory. It's unfortunate that Jones is not an actor, but acting is looked down upon by the twerps of modernism.How does junk like this win awards? Because the people giving awards are even dumber than the people making movies like this, and that is hard to believe.",1,6,12,22 June 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A TV series atmosphere
","Jackson, fortunately and unfortunately, set the bar high with his sequel trilogy of 'Lord of the Rings'.Here, we have a story that probably 95% of this present day generation know about, and about a third know almost every detail, so we're actually dealing with a 'rendition' of a 'fairy tale' in ways.First of all, many characters, notably Gandalf, Bilbo, and Legolas, are household words, and are known to appear in the sequel.There may come a day, fifty years from now, when half the people will not know this, and may see these 'prequels' first, but even then, it will be very well known. We know these certain characters will survive, just as TV regular characters survive.So, it appears that Jackson is giving these certain characters an 'observer' effect, much like Eastwood in HANG EM HIGH and Burr's added in character in GOZILLA.These characters are like the 'stable' personalities of TV series title characters, who observe what guest stars do. One could say that Gandalf is Columbo, Bilbo is Sugarfoot, Legolas is Bronco, and so forth.This story is the second of a trilogy, which is usually the action packed one with less direction. However, here, we have direction with less accomplishments.I don't think it's a spoiler to let people know that the resolution with the dragon comes first, and then the huge war. I was disappointed that this film didn't end with the resolution with the dragon, and save the war for last.That is the way Jackson deviates from the usual pattern. He is using this entire film to 'lead up' to further events. Almost nothing is resolved here, and many subplots are laid in store for the final.It is a very good film, but the bar is high on these films, and I wanted more. I have no problem with the added bits, like the she elf romance. At first, I thought it was a mistake to make Legolas so important, because we know he's in no danger, but it appears to be Jackson's way of saying that he doesn't want his 'fate' to interfere with the story, and that he wants us to observe with him.Radagast makes a brief appearance, but he is purposely made into a cameo character here, as if to downplay him. For those who missed the 'Unexpected Journey', there was a definite symbolism accorded to Gandalf and Radagast as members of a bygone generation, with Gandalf representing the sixties and early seventies hippie movement, the pot smoking activists, and Radagast symbolic of the younger brother of Gandalf, the child of the late seventies, lost as a rebel without a cause.The ineffectiveness of Radagast here, or at least his appearance seeming to be without meaning, is an obvious symbolic gesture by Jackson, who accords the proper praise to the activist generation. It doesn't mean Radagast is useless. It only means that he appears to be during this phase. Hopefully, he will get his chance in the end.This entire film is a 'set up', but doesn't live on its own. It really needs more. I think 'trilogies' are a bit dishonest. It's trying to make us buy 3 books instead of one, to further one's own sales, but it is common in the modern world.I watched this in 3D, and was happy that Jackson didn't abuse the 3D the way a horror movie geek would. He uses it for a purpose, not just to play games with people. I'm happy about that. It's effective this way, and artistic.I disagree with the use of a film to simply set up the next film, but it is entertaining, and does give us the characters we realize will make war inevitable. The elf king and river town king are both greedy and selfish on a believable scale. Of the two, the elf king appears the worse of the two, and the one you could never deal with. We see this with the way he honors (or dishonors) a promise to a prisoner.Obviously, since the film is a 'set up' film, it really shouldn't be as lengthy as it is. However, Jackson isn't making this for us today. He's making this for 'prosperity', to be appreciated 50 years from now, 300 years from now.",6,0,3,26 December 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A monster and a kid
","There's a complex nature to this Western, but it is poorly thought out in respect to what the directorial team tries to accomplish.The title is as misleading as possible. In this story, Robert Ford is a mixed up kid, and any cowardice on his part is simply animal survival instincts. He worships Jesse James, who turns out to be a complete monster, void of natural instincts and natural motivation.Jesse's motivation is pure demonic possession, nothing more. The animal instinct of eliminating the weak from the pack is lost in him. He wants to eliminate, but he has not the slightest idea on how to judge what is weak.And truly it is lost in human beings, for whatever reason. There are actual people, and I'm sure most people of this era have met them, who have no motivation that is natural. They simply are possessed of demons, and are determined to play God with other people's lives, without the slightest natural instinct of how to do it.Such is the case with Jesse in this movie, and that much is depicted correctly, although the old History books make it seem that Frank James was the 'God playing' brother, while Jesse may have been more likely to relent.Still, as depicted in this movie, that part succeeds. Jesse is a monster.However, for some reason, the ending indicates that Jesse was a winner because his corpse was paraded around and people got to applaud the end of a monster. Jesse wasn't there. Just his rotten corpse in all its humility, scoffed at by those who were glad a monster no longer lived among them.For some reason, the director-writer team seemed to believe this made Jesse superior to Ford, because Ford didn't have to contend with the notion that his corpse would be vilified some day. An odd thought that only makes sense to those brain dead sheep who think they do have the natural instincts of an animal, yet are as poor to judge as the Jesse of this movie was.Some hits, some misses.",5,0,2,23 November 2017
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Jackson aims too hard to please
","As of 2012 and 2013, the initial reaction is to compare the fantasy journey among noble dwarfs and elves, and ignoble orcs and trolls, to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which technically occurs after this adventure.Director Jackson did a supreme job on the trilogy, but no matter what you do, you can't please everyone, and he too unprovoked heat from both sides of the fence. Some purists insist on using everything from the book, including Bombadil and his overly blond Hitler idealism. While the dorks wanted less character and the sort of goofy arcade room look in special effects that make the crack heads happy.Jackson goes out to appease the dorks in this one. Not a bad move, but certainly lacking in originality. Here, we get a bit more 'formula' than what we would want.The abuse of effects enhance the comic nature of this story. The three trolls act so much like the Three Stooges that it is obvious Jackson was alluding to them. One of Jackson's signature stamps is the way he alludes to classics, high brow and low brow.The fellowship of nine from the trilogy includes Gandalf, Frodo, and seven others. This one includes Gandalf, Bilbo, and 13 others.With 12 serving under the one, it's not as easy to keep tabs on the characters.Since 'The Hobbit' is done in trilogy format, Jackson appears to be comfortable to gradually let us learn about the 12 minor dwarfs. Here, 3 of them take center stage a lot, and 2 others a bit less. The other 7 are very anonymous.Most of us won't hold that against Jackson, so long as he does more character development in the next film.However, it's one thing to sacrifice the rapport for action, but quite another to sacrifice it for mindless drivel.However, as it is part of a trilogy, one looks at this as a third of a film, or a third of a story. It is often the comedy that brings out the pathos of tragedy. Wen we live and laugh with a group of characters, we are filled with even more sadness when some die.The accents are very thick, good for purists, but not for viewers. We rarely know what is being said, so while the big screen is great for the spectacle, it will be better with the closed captioning on a small TV screen.Not all of the detriments are Jackson's fault. Remember that Tolkien wrote the Middle Earth saga with some inconsistencies. The orcs look bigger, more like the Uruk Hai, but perhaps that is because they are compared to dwarfs and hobbits. The contrasts in size don't appear to be correct at times. And the orcs look much more muscular than Tolkien intended.Now, that was the problem with the film. Not much of a problem, is it? More like a nit pick.My rating shows that it is indeed a nit pick. First of all, the film lasts well over two hours, but you come away from it thinking you spent less than an hour watching. That's the sign of a top director. It flows and moves effortlessly.Next, Bilbo himself is a great character here. He is a throwback to old style films, of the golden age, the forties, fifties, and sixties.Like the ring trilogy, the hobbit begins with the status quo, which changes. That's what makes this sort of story so magical. You begin in a shire, and wind up facing trolls, goblins, and dragons.Jackson makes the climactic point of the saga, the point which fits into his entire Middle Earth legend, a point to remember. It is, of course, the point of Bilbo's mercy towards Gollum, which is done quite dramatically. This is the part of the film that is the classic moment, and Jackson knows this.Not that there aren't other great moments. There are. When we do get to characters, Jackson shows us what a great director he is.One of the great questions to be answered, since we know the Necromancer is Sauron, is whether Saruman is already duped by Sauron. It looks pretty evident that Saruman is already against the forces of good.This takes us to the 'breath of fresh air', the character that makes this film quite unique, and gives Jackson a stamp of originality. There has to be at least one 'cool' character in a saga of this magnitude.Enter RADAGAST THE BROWN, another wizard, like Gandalf. With him, Jackson has literary license, as Radagast is merely a name in the book, a name for a good wizard, but still mostly a name.Radagast becomes the cool cat of this story. His presence is not of our era, but one for the past and for the future. As Gandalf puts it, one with a great heart, and of great power, although he scarcely looks the mighty wizard.Radagast, Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarfs give us a great group of characters.This looks like it shapes up to be part of a great trilogy, but is lacking on its own. It still needs the next two parts to justify it. I would rather the film stand on its own as a film, but it doesn't. It leaves you hanging, much like 'The Empire Strikes Back' did. Many people like 'Empire' films the best. To me, they are the least. In either case, they are necessary if you want to watch the entire trilogy.",7,9,19,22 December 2012
Saving Private Ryan," throwback to old war movies
","This is a throwback to old war movies, make no mistake. We have an identifiable group of men (eight of them), who go on a mission. This one is to risk their lives to save one man. Its based upon the story of the Sullivans, a group of brothers who all died, and the Department of Defense decided it was time to act so that not all of a family would perish in war. The Sullivans served together on the same ship (The Indianaplois), and perished. Of course if they had lived, they probably would have just moved to the East coast, had their own ship, go hunting for a giant shark, and made fun of college kids, then get eaten by a shark any way. So these eight soldiers look for Private Ryan, the last of his family, and are to make him return home. Along the way, they suffer casualties. There isn't a lot of new material here. A lot has been made of the gore, but even the old films had gore to equal or outdo this. Old World War Two films didn't hesitate to have men lose their legs when tanks would run over and amputate them, or to be horribly disfigured. So there is nothing new. The action comes in bits and pieces until a big fight in the end. Some of it looks a little too contrived, to be honest, as though the director was aiming at some conclusion with all the little conclusions coming first. True to old time movies, minor characters die first, and also true to old time movies, men from New York and cigarette smokers get a free pass and cannot be killed, so you know some who will survive. Just a little too trite and Hollywood to be recommended, but not a bad movie.",7,2,7,15 May 2007
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Not inspired, but full of effort
","Wyatt, Jaffa, and Silver validated their license to work here, with a pretty decent effort in the tale of how apes became the dominant species, or will become the dominant species, on Earth.However, while written and directed with efficiency, it doesn't have a lot of inspiration. It looks like a mechanical effort all the way.Still, the efforts of all involved are likable and well done. It's good to see Gollum as the main ape here, giving Andy a chance to give a different type of performance, which must please him no end. He may be the Boris Karloff or Lon Chaney Jr. of the present.The iconic lines of the original movie seemed forced into play here, and I'll nit pick at that as part of the lack of inspiration here. It doesn't stand on its own, which is too bad, because there is a lot of good to this.",7,2,4,19 April 2015
2012," way too Hollywood to even keep you awake
","This is an end of the world story, in case you didn't know. Roughly another remake of WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, which doesn't make it bad. It's a common theme, surviving the end of the world, and should make a good movie.Unless you just make it as Hollywood as you can. This movie is cliché after cliché. We know exactly who will live and who will die from page one, and the attempts at humor are stupid.There's not a fresh idea in this movie. Most modern writers have better scripts in which the world is reformulated. That would be a good idea, if a better script went with it. After watching this tripe, I don't believe you could have had a script that was worse than this.The second biggest failure of this film is the constant barrage of peril. There comes a point, after about 5 disasters in a 20 second period, that we just say 'I don't care any more', and it gets utterly boring, impossible to stay awake through. It's like the con artist who says he'll give you back the money he borrowed if you loan him more. People who grew up rough will not care for this type of 'con', and will fast forward the scenes like I did. It's just not entertainment. Those who think it is would be great marks for the con artists.The biggest failure is the lame attempt to make an 'everyman' hero, but even the 'everyman' is just too well to do to stand out from the others. In fact, all the characters who are glamorized are meant to appeal to rich audiences. This is simple marketing 101, going after the audiences with the most money, but it makes for a poor movie.",2,2,5,19 June 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," an Odyssey of three
","Like most good flower children, I read the trilogy, but I cheated and read the Similrilian first, which kind of gives the whole picture. First, to rate the book, because the movie does try to remain extremely loyal to the book, and in fact the director in all three movies manages to convey each character's emotions much better than JRR did, and JRR used a lot of words-three big books. Tokien was not the genius some say, but the cult that followed was of genius. Now the movie. In this episode, there is much adventure, but it is the odyssey of the three characters-Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum, that really holds your interest, much as the Bridge on the River Kwai holds the children in us in interest with Hawkins, Holden, and the other guy trekking through the jungle. Likewise, the scenes with the interaction of Frodo and Samwise with their enemy-guide Gollum, captivate the viewer. The little bits of humor with characterization, such as when Samwise cooks the rabbit. Gollum responds 'Oooohhhhh, you've ruined it!' That whole bit is priceless. No wonder why during the 70's everyone dreamed of playing Gollum if the movie ever came out. A role you could literally get your teeth into. A delightfully depraved character. The adventures of Merry and Pippin are also likable and well done, and much like the book. They play a minor role, and it is directed as such. The adventures of the others seems a bit overdone, but then the book was a bit overdone. It makes sense that Gandalf never dies in battle, because in the book he was an equivalent of an angel sent by the gods of JRR's world from the beginning of time. One wonders why he can't actually do more. However, why some smart Uruk Hai doesn't just slice off Aragorn's head from behind is miraculous to say the least, but most audiences are accustomed to such miracles for main characters. The battle scenes have been acclaimed, but they lack reality. Never does Aragorn blink, slip, get something in his eye, in all just don't look for realistic fight scenes, but a more modern choreographed look. The bit where Wormtongue goes head over heels for a very pale, plain king's daughter is the hardest thing to believe. But the actress plays her part well, and in fact its hard for a pale woman to look good without twentieth century make-up. All in all, its hard to find fault with this movie. Quite enjoyable.",10,2,5,18 April 2006
The Mist," A true WTF did I just watch failure
","This horror movie about isolated people in a grocery facing unknown horrors outside is the opposite of what Stephen King usually does.
Generally, King captures three dimensional characters, or at least attempts to give 'credible characters in incredible situations' more than most Hollywood writers.
But here we get the opposite. These characters don't even come close to being one dimensional. They're simply seen from a demon possessed point of view of one person.
This one simply rationalizes how the others behave. They don't behave in any realistic way, though he tries to look calm.
It's obvious that this character is a true human monster simply deciding how others act out of his own convenience for the Hell he wants the world to be.
Trouble is that the makers of this movie don't make that clear enough for the feeble minds already totally brainwashed by Western culture's dark ages of Psychiatry, and that means this movie is part of the problem, not the solution.",3,1,3,20 May 2018
Moulin Rouge!," Shades of Rocky Horror in very clever musical
","You can't watch this film without comparing it to THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, and how much you like one is probably how much you'll like the other. It is a stunning musical with bold in your face camera work that is expertly spliced to give the full effect. The story is the basic boy meets girl, which is refreshing in this day of movies in which boy already owns girl. Finally, a throwback to what a film should be. True romance. This movie is for those who are free of spirit so to speak, and possibly not enjoyed as much by the one who is satisfied with the status quo. This film takes chances. It explores, and it takes you on a journey with each separate frame. A lot of the songs are mainstays of pop, refitted and modified. They take some of the lesser pop songs (Roxanne, Like a Virgin), and improve them greatly. These are possibly the best cover songs you will ever hear. I only saw it twice, so I cannot discern the minor characters, but I could tell they were there, and while it will take me more viewings to see how logical they are, it is obvious they are cinematic and work artistically. The main characters are all very entertaining. The hero is a throwback to the old Hollywood era, and is remarkably charismatic. The heroine seems to be a direct spin off of Madonna herself, and the performance is superb. She isn't a natural beauty, but has glitz and glamour galore. The head bad guy is a riot, and it's a toss up as to whether he or the minor characters steal the show. The henchman is more of a force and face, and rarely speaks, but he is very well done. The master of ceremonies has the broadest range written into his lines, and he doesn't disappoint. The music is all spectacular. The scenery is spectacular. The characters have the cult film quality of stereotypes who evolve into characters. This has all the makings of a cult classic if it catches on. Again, the music is very moving and awesome. I gave it an initial 8, but as time goes on and I see it again, and if the cult quality remains, I'll probably raise that rating.",7,2,3,15 May 2007
Kelly's Heroes," Waste of time and money
","Kelly's Heroes suffers on every angle. Its intended to be a war comedy, which makes it very difficult to write, and the screenplay looks as if someone spent all of ten seconds on each page. It is a poor screenplay, and a poor idea. It looks like a group of drunks got together and said, 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we did this in the script', which ultimately makes for predictable, lame scenes. Even good actors would have a hard time making a poor screenplay work, but good talent often shines through. O'Conner shines as the General Patton type, chewing up the scenery, but Eastwood has never been an actor. He's been in about a hundred movies, and maybe four of them were good. He runs the usual gamut of Eastwood expressionless emotions. All one of them. Even John Wayne could make two or three expressions. But Eastwood is the worst of the worst actors. (A good director, though.) When you think of all the money and time spent on this project, for a few laughs from the future Archie Bunker, and some forgettable characters that even the best actor would have a hard time making interesting, this is truly a bomb.",7,9,45,10 April 2006
Kelly's Heroes," Unique story, lead characters done well, others not
","This war film combines some comedy with drama with pathos with a crime caper.It is unique. Kelly (Eastwood) is a busted lieutenant, who is now under Joe (Savalas) in a squad of GIs in WWII in the European theater. They have survived the D Day beach massacre, and are one of the more persecuted units in their company.They combine with Oddball (Sutherland) and others to steal Gold from a bank in occupied territory that is about to be abandoned. Roughly $18,000,000 in Gold bars is for grabs.The strength of the movie is the relationship of the lead characters, the 'Beatle' characters so to speak. When two men get together, one is 'John', and one is 'Paul', and when three get together, another is 'George', who is clearly the spiritual tank commander Oddball. The 'Ringo' is a combination of other GIs, most notably the ones played by Gavin McLeod of Mary Tyler Moore fame, and Alien victim Harry Dean Stanton.Which is John and which is Paul? John is usually seen as loud and boisterous, and Paul as quiet, but that is misleading. John is also the more reckless, more risk taking, less caring, more snobbish, more mercantile one, while Paul is the one who is more likely to keep everyone safe.That makes Kelly the 'John' figure and Savalas a total change of his usual character as the more rational 'Paul' figure.In fact, even though Oddball comes across as kooky, even he is saner than Kelly. Both he and Joe are more rational, more strategic, more open minded, than Kelly.Kelly isn't a sadist, though. There is no such thing as a psychopath. That is a concoction of Psychiatrists in what is presently the darkest age of mental health. Mental health professionals need a safety zone in their dark age belief that there is no evil, so they wrongly state that some people don't feel empathy with others. Anyone from the hood knows different. Some are mercantile souls who have a goal and then try to obtain the goal, hoping no one is hurt, but living with it. Others are sadists whose first goal is actually causing suffering of others, and then pretend to have a goal of greed or envy in order to accomplish that goal. In either case, both do know that people in pain are in pain.Kelly is the mercantile soul. He has a goal of taking Gold, and is willing to share it. He doesn't want others to suffer, but he's willing to kill hundreds of German soldiers to get it, because he simply figures he's going to kill enemy soldiers any way, so why not get something for it?Carroll O'Conner provides the best comedy of the movie as a general who is out of touch with the troops.The movie does have weaknesses. The weaknesses boil down mostly to one: dehumanization of the supporting characters. Aside from the 'Beatle' characters, few characters are treated with any dignity, and most are caricatures, particularly a stereotypical crud played by Don Rickles.The GIs are totally invulnerable, and bullets find very few of them, even though they never miss German targets. While German soldiers have always been the biggest whipping post of Hollywood, this is one of the worst cases of dehumanization. Hollywood even treats American Indians with more dignity, as they are always treated with respect in cavalry films, and lose mostly because they have spears and arrows against repeating rifles. German soldiers are certainly the whipping post boys of Hollywood.Here, the kill count is even more ridiculous than 'The Dirty Dozen', if you can believe that is possible.While the movie seems to poke fun at characters, it never pokes fun at itself, and tries to come off as credible, which it isn't. The best movies are good because of credible supporting characters. This one lacks that for the most part, as most are clowns meant for cannon fodder, and totally 'contrived' in 'contrived' circumstances.However, the movie is very watchable. It is well directed and filmed, with a logical sequence of events, and no lulls. There is bit of pathos, most notably in the mine field. There are some good elements, and it's basically a likable movie if one concentrates on the three lead characters alone. However, it isn't likable if one looks at how the supporting characters are so contrived.",7,0,1,15 January 2020
Casualties of War," More than any other movie, a boy grows up in a hurry
","If there's a moral to this story, aside from all the basic ones, its that a lot of casualties of war are because boys are sent in to fight for causes they only know a little about. In this case, Michael Fox plays a boy who, more than any other movie ever made, has to grow up in a hurry. He is part of a fighting unit which has gone loco, thanks mostly to two insane members. The five man unit kidnap a young girl in order to rape and kill her. Fox does all he can to stop it, as a boy who is a member of a respected group. During the movie, Fox realizes he must be more than that to stop the maniacs. He realizes the maniacs will never stop. In essence, he becomes a man, which alienates him from the numerous maniacs in charge, which is the real problem. Excellent writing and production. And one of the best realistic yet Hollywood endings of all time.",7,1,1,5 March 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Goofy garbage again
","This is a sort of zombie movie, only unlike the betters ones, zombies have unbelievable motor skills. The characters are all super powered brats who have a million weapons at their disposal. This is part for the course for the 'goofy' movies that brats like to stuff down the public's throat. This one is no worse.It is also a cigarette commercial. They make sure you see tough characters smoking cigarettes. I've never seen anyone I gym or jog with smoke a cigarette. I realize we aren't supposed to fixate on reality, but we shouldn't have to be force fed complete garbage, either.Everyone is an acrobat, unless we're talking about someone who doesn't deserve to live. One woman leaps over a car long ways, leaps on top of a car, and then leaps fifty feet in the air. I warned you it was goofy.The zombies also defy Science. We could almost accept old time zombies being brainless, but now these new ones have incredible motor skills. Where from? Again, more goofball crap.A few likable characters keep this from being a total bomb. Clearly not a good movie, however. Just more goofy garbage that no one can relate to, and no one can be interested by, except a few computer nerds who think they have super powers in some Universe.",3,1,4,24 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Predictable Hollywood Nazi worship meshed with incoherent garble
","Lucas goes all out with Hitler worship in this totally Hollywood mess.It was meant to be part of the Star Wars Universe of science fiction, but it lacks any imagination, is void of strategy, and has zero inspiration, unless you're a devout Nazi.First of all, it's just incoherent garble. We're just fed images, all of which are based on the ideology of Hitler and his mistress. The entire story is contrived to kill as many dark haired, dark eyed, dark skinned beautiful women as possible. In complete adherence to the overwhelming Hollywood majority of Nazi propaganda providers, Lucas gives us the most predictable mess he could.That's pretty much all he does in this movie. And it's so contrived, he can't possibly feel good about it. He truly is out to make the women happy with this one.There's no plot, no character. The best thing is the snow foxes, but that's not enough, and in fact, it's a waste to have any good visuals in this hate mongering, demon worshiping, divisive, and totally depressing junk (at least depressing to any young heterosexual male).Just too depressing, and too trite.",1,7,10,12 December 2019
Clash of the Titans," directors on drugs
","3/10 is where I'll start with this. It may be generous, but it isn't all terrible. Over time it may creep up to a 3 or 4 out of 10, if it gets edited.It's loosely the story of Perseus, no more or less digressed than most films. A Greek hero kills monsters and rescues a damsel in distress.What is done with the film is pretty annoying. The script is cliché, but we can live with that. Lots of characters look like carry overs from other action films. There's a few twists that may make it a little less bland.The actors do their job. I have no problem with them. They deal with a very mundane script and poor editing. The little people involved in make up and other jobs obviously made a serious effort.The director seems to be on drugs, however. We have no logical pattern. We aren't really introduced to most of the characters, and the action is just a dork's video game, a complete blur, ridiculous and impossible to follow. There is no logical sequence of events in the action presented, or in the characters. Again, not the fault of the actors, but of horrid directing. To call it splotchy is an understatement.It tries to make some points, and for the effort people made, I generously give this a 3/10. Still, it is very disappointing, and makes the original look like a classic.",3,5,7,20 April 2010
Jurassic World," Retarded and full of Nazi genocidal brainwashing
","Trevorrow and Jaffa have joined the ranks of the completely uninspired and completely without strategy in their desire to keep up the Hollywood clichés and the brainwashing.On the surface, this is a dinosaur sci-fi film with people trying not to be eaten, though it looks like they can't wait to be eaten. The effects are good, which makes it even worse, because it's wasted on the worst and most hate filled control freak script of the series of Jurassic movies.It's bad enough the characters are all retards, save a few underlings. The hero, his sidekick, and the younger of the boys alone show even a trace of not being retarded, while all of the other characters are not only retarded, and not only do all of them have superiority complexes common with the control freaks who dish this crap out, but all of them are thoroughly boring creeps that make the audience look at watches, like I did, throughout the film.There's more to alienate the audience, or at least to alienate the young men. Throughout the series, we've been forced to watch dull plain blond women over and over, and we knew no harm would befall them, and just as contrived, Nazi card carrying Trevorrow and Jaffa introduce the first hot chick, the first brunette, for the sole purpose of making her the only female fatality in the entire series.The selective sex genocidal statement is not only obvious and undeniable, it's pathetic and overt. Oh sure, women may like this idea, but movies present a world, and this world is the most depressing one imaginable to a heterosexual young man. This was all that the control freaks like Coppola and Leone did in the late sixties and seventies, and all their Nazi trainees did in the eighties, and now the genocidal monsters froth at the mouth to go retro to that hate filled era that spawned much of the same in reality. These punks know what they're doing, and they can deny it all they want, but it's all they do.There is no strategy to anything Jaffa writes or Trevorrow directs. Absolutely no inspiration. They hate inspiration. That should be evident from the poor credibility of how their characters act, and their fascination with poor characters. The older brother, for instance, hasn't one saving grace. Nor does the heroine. They're beyond being mere 'creeps'. They're absolute human monsters, and what we see here is an acceptance of such monsters to be okay, and to believe they can change.They can't change. And the maniacs who made this movie prove it. Undeniably the worst of the Jurassic Park series, and a complete embarrassment. All they wasted on the creatures and effects is meaningless with their poor job on human characters and on their desire to produce their Nazi genocidal mission.I don't know who is sicker. Trevorrow, Jaffa, or the human scum who applaud them and keep them in their undeserved status.",1,18,36,15 June 2015
The Graduate," Waste of great music
","What makes a bad movie a horrible bomb is when there is a waste of talent, money, props, and among other things, music. Lots of lame movies depend upon great music. None of the scenes in which the songs are heard even remotely match the moods of the song, not even in opposition. They just lay flat and meaningless, like giving the winner of a footrace a picture of Albert Einstein. It makes no sense. Of course this movie is dismal on its own. The lead character, the graduate, has an affair with his father's friend's wife, and his father's friend's daughter. Which makes for good locker room humor, but a boring movie line. But after the affairs, the character has a holier than thou attitude, and a complete disrespect for anyone he knows or meets. Why is he so angry? It makes no sense. And there's no reason to feel any emotion for him. None of the characters are believable, and none of them are interesting. Bad script, bad directing, bad acting.",1,32,64,5 April 2006
Taken," Standard Republican propaganda
","To their credit, the film makers don't disguise this film. We know from this from the CORNIEST, least imaginative preview ever for a film, with the hero taking the phone call and doing his right wing propaganda speech to his daughter's kidnappers.And make no mistake, this is a right wing propaganda film for big business, big brother, big shots. This isn't about a little guy fighting a system. This is about 'don't mess with the big guy', just like 'Ransom'. The billionaires of this world need films like this to keep criminals from attacking the rich, and films like this help ensure that criminals will continue to plague the poor.Very predictable, and about as self righteous as you'd expect. If you're a Christian, you'll be turned off immediately, since it extols the virtues of self righteous vengeance and man's law.Standard ho hum action scenes, and comically laughable situations. Even a 5 year old kid would find this stupid.2/10, which is very generous I admit.",2,7,14,21 December 2009
The Last Samurai," Well meaning flop
","This movie has a spirit of realism about it, mixed in with the modernism of blood and gore (not that blood and gore is modern, but the fascination, obsession, and glorification of it is). Cruise plays the 'Steve Martin' role (as Raymond Burr's Steve Martin was inserted into 'Godzilla' for an American or English speaking character.) It is his character that probably weakens this movie the most. The film centers on the escapades of traditional samurai in a changing empire. It would definitely have been a stronger movie had the English speaking character not been inserted just for...what was he there for? He serves no purpose, and he is not really identifiable as a character. He is void of personality and evokes no sympathy from the viewer. He isn't bad. He just isn't anything. This is no reflection on Cruise the actor. It is a reflection on a dull, ho hum character badly written. This makes the movie plod along, and the viewer just wants to get it over with. It was well intentioned, but a flop.",3,2,5,20 June 2008
The Descent," very much a waste of time movie
","I went to see this movie with someone else, and she hated the movie even more than I did. I think I enjoyed the movie more than anyone in the theatre, and I rate it a 2 out of 10. It was clear to me that the writers and director made this movie solely for the Worst Film Festival. It was humorous in all the clichés it used, and the predictability of it. The camera work was worse than pitiful. Very few scenes were in focus, and the need to be out of focus is unclear. The sound crew was obviously asleep, too. These are trifling miseries, though, compared to a goofy plot and goofy characters. They don't hold your interest, and you spend most of your time yawning and wondering when the picture will finally end. Six women spelunk into unknown territory and at first you think its a remake of 'Deliverance,' with a Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight character apiece. Then Gollum appears. Only, there are a bunch of Gollums, which makes this at least a mildly hilarious film. These Gollums eat people, by the way. Along the way the director uses most clichés-the photo of the doomed crew, the false alarms, the stereotypical characters-how could they forget the biggest cliché, however (the slow motion 'No'), makes one wonder whether this was intended to be a dark satire or not. A lot of critics were obviously on the take, or stockholders, because this movie only belongs in a Worst Film Festival. If you watch it, expecting to see what these critics tell you, don't say I didn't warn you. Best to watch it as a comedy, and then only mildly disappointing.",2,9,17,20 December 2006
Inside Man," Hits and misses
","There really isn't any incentive for watching these movies, because of the poor directing that is set as a standard for modern movies, and because of the lack of inspiration caused by establishment writers stealing ideas from the better writers, as this movie so obviously shows us.It isn't a bad movie, but it has the flaws of modern movie making.It's a 'bank heist with hostage' movie, but it's clear from the start that something else is happening. When the robbers separate the many hostages, and make everyone change garb over and over, including the garb of the robbers, we know they are intending to blend in with the crowd at the end in some way.In effect, it's much like the 1960 war movie, THEN THERE WERE THREE, in which a German is disguised as an American during a big battle involving many units that get split apart. The war movie is a hidden classic because of low budget and few big names, but it is written and directed skillfully.The first problem is the inane modern day use of 'mixing time frames' which not only doesn't fit here, but is stupid, because it is contrived. It's a device meant to confuse whereas it doesn't work in real life. It only serves to hide the flaws of the plot. If you see the movie, you'll understand.Second problem is that every one of the hostages and robbers looks exactly alike. I believe there are about 4 that don't fit the pattern. All the men look alike, and most of the women look alike. And yet we're supposed to understand who is saying what at any time? Added to the 'time frame mix'.Third, no detective is as astute as Denzel's character. Of course, this is spoken of in the movie. Detectives are unimaginative and have no sense of reality compared to the cop on the beat. They're upwardly mobile machines who are incorrect about everyone most of the time, because they adhere to these dark ages of Psychiatry and Sociology meant to give the squeaky wheel the grease and avoid being hurt themselves.Fourth, the flood of information. That means all the useless crap we get that is purely in the movie to showcase or advertise someone's dialect, product, etc.. Because of the nature of this movie, that works as long as it doesn't interfere with the reality of the viewer piecing together the puzzle. It sets the viewer back from what the actual detective is piecing together.This fourth flaw is important, because it a simulation of modern culture, including Academia. Colleges and businesses pretend to give tests to grade students, but for the past 30 years, at the very least, have instead cheated. For example, a professor will ask a question in an oral test to a student, and then after the student answers, the professor will change the question, and will be backed up by the students who are part of the establishment. This happens in all U.S. universities I have attended. Businesses do this, too. It's the modern norm to keep control in the hands of the mob.Herein lies also the strength of the movie. The fact that no one really knows anything, and everyone is lying. However, the script is not very good at showing that.The fifth flaw is characters that no one can relate to. Again, this is because of modern culture, and because the control freaks are in control. They actually think we enjoy them bragging about their hatefulness, but only the geeks enjoy that. There is absolutely no explanation or credibility in some of the characters, particularly the blond woman who acts as a go between for police, bank president, and robber. She would never have been let into the situation by any of them. But then, this also serves as a strength of the movie, because Tarantino is telling us that the control freaks in charge are too moronic and self righteous to realize this woman is nothing. She has no assets. She's normal looking, not pretty by any means. She says nothing, offers nothing, and yet the ones in authority kowtow to her. That actually works. However, when Denzel's character gives in to her, we lose respect for him, too.The characters are mostly poorly written and done. The usual Hollywood preaching of 'bank robbers are cool' fools the naïve, but not the rest of us, and it irks sane people.There are other modern movie flaws, but the production team was wise enough not to show that this 'modern movie making' was indeed a flaw. It's a self depreciating bit that does make a point.Hits and misses. The worst part is the 'mixed time frame' element. Get rid of that, and the movie will be a lot better.",6,2,3,5 December 2017
Pulp Fiction," Mildly amusing in parts
","Pulp Fiction is mildly amusing in parts, and in all honesty relies completely on the scene that makes the movie, from where Bruce Willis walks past the clothesline to where he makes up with the hilarious crime boss. Much like the log scene makes a King Kong movie. The scenes with Willis are livelier than the scenes with the two dull, obnoxious hit men who get way too much screen time, and put the viewer to sleep. The surface plot of this movie is pretty dull, and it's tough to care with the poorly written characters, but it relies on its 'iconic' style of trash talk and actions. The hidden plot of this movie is the title itself of 'Pulp Fiction'. This movie has mixed allusions to different eras. Sometimes, it is the late eighties and early nineties, but more often it is the late sixties, early seventies, with the rotary phones, clothes lines, rarity of billboards, and the songs people tapped fingers to in those days. What we have is essentially a make believe world in which kids from the seventies think the world is like outside, where everyone carries a gun and is either a boxer, gangster, killer, or lunatic. The 'modern' images are all imagined by the seventies kids thinking they'll be in such a world when they grow up. A decent idea, but it could have been done better with more interesting hit men. The Bruce Willis character, and his performance, help salvage this, though.",6,6,15,11 April 2006
Jack Reacher," The opposite of art
","First good news about this movie.Now, the bad news, well some of the bad news, because it would take a novel to tell just part of the bad news.This alleged action movie begins dull, with random violence, and every negative Hollywood cliché ever, including the neo Nazi propaganda so popular in the 1965-1985 pathetic era of neo Nazi Hollywood.It goes down hill from there.It's too dull to watch in one sitting.All the settings are dull city settings, or just about all. Any good looking dark haired woman is killed, true to the Hollywood neo Nazi agenda that Tom Cruise has always been a part of.Then, we get the hero doing the ridiculous. And it doesn't matter who plays the hero in a goofball role, because it's a goofball role. Obviously, the neo Nazi agenda hooked Tom Cruise into it.What is the ridiculous? All of it. So lets just take the introduction of the hero. The police commissioner and the detective ask him questions, and instead of answering them, the hero asks them questions, which the pair 'Uncle Tom' him with every kowtow imaginable. Like no police or legal professionals anyone ever met.It's simply impossible to relate to anything about this. From there we get a bunch of stoic, no-smile faces that is supposed to indicate toughness, and the dull routine superman bit.This is the opposite of art, and it only sells because long ago the movie industry became ruled by people jealous of art and beauty, and who rewarded lack of art, and found they could make movies like this for the innumerable bubble boy and girl brats whose only desires are to stifle true art, to antagonize sane people, to cause as much depression as possible, to promote the hateful neo Nazi agenda of Hollywood, and to dictate hatred to those who aren't insane.Is it the worst movie ever? Close to it, but there are so many clones of this crap loved by IMDb brats whose only love is 'hatred', that there are many rivals for 'worst movie ever'. It probably is the 'most cliché filled' and 'most ridiculous' ever.",1,3,10,19 October 2015
Enemy at the Gates," More educational than entertaining
","The pluses of 'Enemy at the Gates' much outweigh the minuses. In all, the movie was an effective display of brutality in war, and of some of the nonsense that goes on not only in war, but in the world, that leads to bloodshed. Often what makes a film is great acting from all the minor characters. In this movie, the minor characters outshine the stars in every instance. I think of it more a warning than a spoiler to state that Perlman, whose character the viewer knows will die, is killed almost as soon as he is introduced. People expecting to see more from him should expect to see what amounts to a large cameo instead. However, he does dominate while on screen, and does have the major line of the movie, about the sickle and the hammer. The three Russian leads are drawn with some compassion and humanity, but they don't stir a lot of interest, and the actors playing these roles are the worst at enunciating and expressing their words. You basically have to guess at what they are saying, and that is unforgivable. It is more important to convey the message and characters than to simply speak with thick accents. Indeed, it is Sacha and his mother who dominate the story, although they don't appear that much. And it is the quest of the mother in the end that draws the viewer instead of the quest of the lead character. Gabriel Thomson gives an incredible performance as the tyke, Sacha, and Eva Mattes is downplayed as the mother, but does admirably in her small screen time. The plot is probably one of the weak points here. Its hard to make excitement out of 'cat and mouse', and the story takes heavy theatrical license. The director makes the mistake of showing whole scale carnage that can't be escaped early in the film, yet tries to persuade the viewer to believe the lead character and the German sniper can only be killed by each other. Of course, younger viewers will appreciate the larger than life characters and accept this, but mature viewers will be puzzled by the directing, which means they're paying more attention to the method than the story, a bad sign for an entertainer. Still, there are more truths than fallacies to the story, and it is enlightening. The directing and film editing look splotched. Sacha, for example, just magically appears in the presence of the German sniper. There are other examples. But the director redeems himself overall. The last sequence involving Ed Harris and Gabriel Thomson is extremely effective. Looks more like a classroom educational film with marginal entertainment value than a blockbuster, but overall a film with more pluses than minuses.",6,1,2,29 June 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," The worst of Hollywood
","This is supposed to be a movie about American intelligence against terrorism.It's actually just the worst of Hollywood clichés.First, don't try to make sense of it. You won't be able to understand a single word any of the actors playing Americans utter. This is a usual problem with modern Hollywood. They love actors and actresses who can't enunciate one word, and who speak with words so garbled together that it is impossible to understand what they say.Next, expect the usual Nazi propaganda, in which it is imperative to show that only dark haired women are killed, and blond women have a super power that keeps them alive. This is something that helps keep the women interested, as most women are jealous of brunettes, and identify with blonds, no matter who they are.It's so contrived in this way that one may not even notice it's contrived in every way. It looks like someone making up a story to explain events, just to make the person look tough.No one with any experience at all is going to buy this. We know there is no intelligence in American intelligence, and they're thirty years behind the homeless guy on the street.",1,3,9,12 September 2014
There Will Be Blood," Dull stereotypes aren't worth waiting for
","This is a poor movie by any definition, but there are a few saving graces. The graces are part of why it is a poor movie. The few saving graces are two very funny scenes, maybe a few more if you are being overly generous in assessing this movie. And the hugest problem is that you have to sit through too much boredom for the set up.Writer Director Paul Thomas Anderson does a slipshod job of writing and directing. He is clearly writing with more emotion than brains, as he obviously wants to make a name for himself by being way too politically correct in his story of an insane oil man and a stereotypical religious fanatic just after the turn of the twentieth century.The trouble with trying to fit in too much is that you are easily recognized. This is where the term 'dork' came in, to describe the TV characters like Ted Baxter of 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' and Herb of 'WKRP in Cincinnati', men who tried so hard to be 'cool' that they looked ...dorky.Daniel Day Lewis does what he is always stereotyped to do, play a control freak. One can't say it's a good acting job, because any person, anyone who has any experience at all in Theater, knows that playing the control freak is simple. The real acting comes from those who react and allow the control freak to speak his lines and get away with it. That's nothing against Daniel Day. It isn't his fault that he is stereotyped into roles that require no more acting than a walk on can do.It does give credit to the acting talents of the rest of the cast, and clearly Daniel Day did his job, too.If one is simply wanting to see theatrical work done by actors, one will be rewarded. If one wants to see a clever story, one will be very disappointed. If one wants to be amused, one will be disappointed for most of the movie.We're never sure what is going on, due to the poor directing. It looks like the character of Daniel Plainview (played by Daniel Day Lewis), begins as a gold miner, switches to oil when he finds it, and lucks into being a huge success. It is also clear from the start that he is going to be another of the cliché psychopaths we are expected to like, but only other psychopaths could possibly care about.We see a character betray his family and townspeople, selling out like a quisling to Plainview, and he never resurfaces, but all through the movie we wonder where he is. We know he'll be important at the end. We wonder why he is a quisling, and more on that later.Meanwhile, Plainview is another of the control freaks we are constantly bludgeoned with by hack writers. Yes, it does make him the most stereotypical of dull clichés, and we have a hard time staying awake. The background characters are clearly more interesting, if only because they aren't as stereotypical as the leads.The other main character is the religious fanatic that hack writers want to believe exist, but which you never meet in real life, and in fact are so easy to spot and so easy for journalists to capitalize on, that every single one who has existed since the printing press has been headline news. Their very nature makes them too easy to find and reveal. Yet, by some miracle, we only find a handful. And by an even bigger miracle, hack writers have sold this handful to the public as a believable stereotype. Real religious leaders have to watch every single word they utter. Even a cough condemns them because of hate mongering hack writers like Anderson. 'Easy target' is what dorks like Anderson look for, and he humiliated himself to any intelligent viewer.The movie is probably a comedy, but if so, it is very slow in building up jokes. It is a very dull, dry comedy. Anderson continues in his 'dork' persona by trying for the most acceptable of dark comedy. Again, he is too obvious.The entire movie looks to be written out of rabid hatred. The object of the hatred here is a cliché that only exists in feeble hate filled minds.Back to the quisling, whom Anderson seems to want to justify. He fails miserably. Anderson seems to have lived a remarkably sheltered life if he thinks this quisling character suffered persecution from family and committee. If Anderson ever met with persecution, he'd know this.Anderson is not subtle one bit, and it's sad that scripts and ideas of better writers are passed over to produce such one dimensional drivel of a man who thinks of nothing but hate, who worships nothing but hate, and who makes movies that can only be enjoyed by fellow control freaks filled with hate. Pathetic.",7,1,5,5 August 2011
There Will Be Blood," Change of point of view
","There are three major components in this drama about a sadistic oil tycoon who wants to play God with other people's lives.It begins with the future tycoon (Daniel) surviving a disaster, crawling to safety. From that point onward, he becomes a worshiper of the Devil, not so much in name, but in his worship of Evil. He believes he is a god by virtue of his good fortune.His sadistic character, which this dark age of Psychiatry likes to pretend is actually a lack of empathy, is actually just pure Sadistic evil in a desire to play God with other people. That is what psychopaths do. We're in the darkest age of Psychiatry and Science that has ever existed among humans.It's proven when he just arbitrarily decides to treat one twin boy with fairness, and the other with absolute evil, for absolutely no reason. That's the second component of this film. When the second boy greets him with friendship, Daniel immediately sneers the sort of demonic hatred that many of us have found in such people in real life.The hatred is totally unprovoked. That happens in real life. Daniel just decides to torment this young man and satisfy his devil worshiping lust.The third component is the point of view. It becomes obvious about two thirds of the way through the film, or at least I thought it was obvious, that the movie was an experiment in point of view, changed from the Disney sort of POV from the fifties.By that, I mean the usual heroes are never seen. The 'holdout' family of heroes, who are the film's biggest winners, represent what were once the Swiss Family Robinson, the McCahans, the space family Robinson, all the usual heroic groups.But we never see them. Instead, we see the other components, from outside their world. However, this is also exactly what the heroic family sees, and it does enable them to be able to combat the evil of Daniel and his demonic force.One character gets to see all of this, and learn from it. Daniel's adopted son. He becomes a helpless character early on, helpless against the evil of Daniel, and at first tries to fight fire with fire, quite literally. He learns the passive approach. One could say this is a fourth component of the film, but I think of it more as a product of the first three components.",7,1,6,28 October 2018
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Brings up historical accuracy question, but has some truths
","By now, everyone has seen the History channel and knows there are flaws in the story. But are they major flaws or minor flaws? That said, there can be no doubt that this is a moving and great story. It centralizes on three characters mostly, and another three characters to a lesser degree. It loosely recounts the horrors of being a POW to the ruthless Japanese. The prisoners were forced to build a bridge under extremely harsh conditions. That statement doesn't begin to make a person feel the horror of the situation, and makes one feel as though it is whitewashed. This film, however, did little whitewashing. It begins with two prisoners explaining to the British officers that of all the hundreds of American and Australian prisoners who began the work, only these two were still alive. This pretty well explains it was horrible without going into details. The debate could go on about how far you make your actors go into portraying men who would be physically skeletons, but I feel that an audience can get the point without an actor forcing his body into severe hunger and malnutrition. Indeed, such an actor would be impossible to keep on his feet for retakes. The three main characters are the British colonel (Alec Guiness), a charismatic American rogue (William Holden) and the Japanese commander. A fourth player, Warren (Jack Hawknis) becomes a major catalyst with them, when he leads a small commando team to destroy the bridge. Most of the excitement comes from the commando team traipsing through a jungle. Two more characters serve as likable and identifiable observers (Joyce and the doctor). The story hops from the excitement of the jungle to the drama inside the prison camp. For most people, the jungle scenes will peak the most interest. But the drama in the camp is riveting for mature audiences. Guiness had the tougher role and was awarded the most acclaim, but Holden got the easier and most charismatic role, and gets the reward of being the most liked. There is a lot of sadness at the end. As a tragedy, this is a remarkable story. As a historical account, it doesn't deviate from the important things. It is probably accurate to compare real conditions in comparison, if not as completely true, with the major German camp movie STALAG 17 (also Holden) compared with BRIDGE OF THE RIVER KWAI. There is a line from the former movie in which Holden proclaims a reason not to escape the German camp is that you could get sent to Japan and wind up in a Japanese camp. Given a choice, an American POW would much prefer the harsh conditions of a German camp to the Hell of a Japanese camp.",9,1,3,15 May 2007
Con Air," Silly fun
","I'm not a fan of big budget goofiness, but this pokes enough fun at itself to be enjoyable.No one really takes their goofy roles seriously in this convicts take over everything movie, and that's good.It's just shoot 'em up action, and funny lines.I could do without all the ignorant special effects and the fires and the explosions, but at least here the production team uses it all for laughs. It can't be taken seriously.It's best to call this a comedy, although a dark one.Nothing irritating in this movie, and the many subplots and supporting characters really helps this movie. Generally, it isn't good for movies to simply showcase actors (Superman III comes immediately to mind), but as in Superman III, it is for laughs. Though here it works better.",7,1,2,5 December 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Storyboard with no inspiration
","SKULL ISLAND isn't a terrible movie. It's just lame.This depiction of another adventure for King Kong, involving modern day military and civilians, along with a WWII castaway, has many problems, but it boils down to two main ones that affect any possible enjoyment of this action adventure.First, there is not one piece of credible motivation other than some running from monsters. Not one character is believable, particularly the one played by Samuel Jackson. For the actors, this has to be a huge embarrassment.Fans will claim it's meant to be just dumb fun, but it isn't 'fun' when it alienates the viewer the way this movie does. The 'likable' character has to be from Chicago, which is just another of the three big cities (the other two being NYC and LA) that alienate everyone else. There has never been a likable character from the three cities of self righteous superiority complex beings, and only the geeks keep them in power.Aside from a few bits of running and fear, nothing is credible. And so there is nothing any person can relate to.Which leads to the second problem. The movie abounds with the usual ho hum overuse of action shots that just deaden the air. The people who make this ignorance and the people who enjoy it are apparently the people who try to eat an entire wedding cake in one bite. Aside from those people, this movie alienates everyone else.The problem is obviously that it is maintained first by 'storyboard' first, with story second. This failure is the result of that philosophy. There is no inspiration, which leads to no credible character motivation. Best example is the 'storyboard' depiction of Sam Jackson glaring at carnage. It looks more like a comic book artist at work, not an inspired writer. People whose hands can make pictures don't necessarily have inspiration, as we see here. It's just goofy poses for pre-first grade thinking.The movie doesn't stink. It just doesn't do anything special. It's a waste.",2,1,3,11 January 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," That still only counts as one!
","One film in three parts. Which is best? Which is worst? Hard to say.I think I speak for the consensus when I say this trilogy is weaker as a whole than Lord of the Rings, and I'm guessing Jackson did this on purpose for the simple reason he knew it couldn't compare to what may be the most awesome trilogy that will ever be made. So he simply made a 'good' trilogy, not opting for the 'special classic' effect.The fantasy story of Bilbo's journey among mightier beings in Middle Earth is told in this trilogy with some trivial changes, but none of the changes are 'drastic' changes, including the romance between the dwarf and the she-elf.This part of the trilogy is the most superficial, by far. The others had some bits of innovation. There is almost no innovation here. It's strictly hard core action.The only strength of this film is that a few things happen that aren't the usual 'predictable' things. These three involve the coward, the elf king, and the she elf. Everything else is very mundane.The weakness of this film is the lack of humor. There is almost no comic relief. No 'the big one, the big one!' No 'what about second breakfast?' No 'that still only counts as one!' The closest we get to comic relief is the coward character, and that is at best a scant comic relief, and not well done. The coward is so much like Worm Tongue of the ring trilogy that we already know there is a connection there. So much is the resemblance that Jackson would be appear more imaginative if he didn't make them related.The lack of comic relief makes this seem like more of an ordeal, especially with the long drawn out battle scenes, the long drawn out musings of the dwarf leader, and the long drawn out tragic scenes of the romantic couple. Those who read the book, and probably over half of the others, know which three dwarfs will die, so it isn't much of a spoiler to say which three, but I won't spoil it.Another huge weakness is the overkill of the super power bad guys. They loom like giants and appear too much like the Greek demi gods who can only be killed by other demi gods. This movie is much too classical Greek in that respect.The characters are well drawn, though, especially the minor ones, and that is a strength. Indeed, that's what keeps the movie from being on the low side of average. It is strong on character, but weak on the very action it overkills on, an overkill necessary to please the geeks and dorks, of course.In the long run, I call it the slightly weakest of the three because of the lack of comic relief. Jackson tried too hard to make this too harsh, to please the Hollywood hate cliché loving dorks. He sold out on this one big time.",6,1,4,24 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing
","The line from King Lear probably best describes what should have been a clever script, but instead was 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'. The writers of the screenplay must have felt very hogtied in what they could do to keep this movie legitimate in accord with the two previous episodes and three ensuing episodes that the writers were bound to live by. However, the lack of imagination in tying the stories together was so appalling, that one wonders why the movie was made to begin with. The movie starts out with what looks like some ignorant video game, the director reveling in his chaotic world, but he doesn't bring the audience with him. Most of what follows is uninspired dialogue, only written to cement the movies together, a vain attempt to establish character, and more special effects that no one cares about. However, the biggest flaw is the future Darth Vader, who we know will turn evil, but his trust in an evil creature to keep his word is more than bewildering. It just doesn't get established as believable on a character standpoint. The characters of Obi and Yoda are much better drawn, but the viewer feels he must credit that to the writers of the other movies, since the other characters are so blandly written, and the dialogue is beyond cheesy. The movie actually looks more like an insane video game. So much so, its hard to care about anything that occurs. The viewer must struggle throughout what seems like an endless movie. Obviously made just to cement the portions of the story together, with absolutely no creative talent thrown in. A good example of what kind of tripe is formed when a movie is made up by storyboard artists instead of creative individuals.",2,3,5,28 May 2006
Sherlock Holmes," poorly done, but a few saving graces
","Sherlock Holmes is well known enough. What is important in Sherlock mysteries is 'atmosphere'. We need to get a feel of the times he lived in, and of the London fog.This film captures some of the feel, but not nearly as well as the old Basil Rathbone films. They weren't perfect, but they were more entertaining than this.This film does give us a better 'Watson', however. He was never meant to be the simpleton. Here, he is a man of deeds, as he was intended to be.The failure of this film is in Downey. He gives us the worst impression of Holmes imaginable. He is not convincing, and you cannot understand a single word this hack says. The fact that the other actors are somewhat coherent with their British dialects (which is a mistake to use dialects too British) makes Downey's miserable performance a caricature of Ineptitude.The characters and events are a million times more predictable and cliché than the old Basil films as well. A few characters work, the giant and the bad girl are fairly well designed. Other than that, ho hum.We have no idea what is going on, or where these places they go to are. It is all just a muddle. Poorly written or poorly directed, it doesn't matter. The end result is the fault of the director.Just not much going for this ordeal. A failure, any way you look at it.",3,2,5,2 July 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," No redemption for pitiful movie
","This movie is more of a drama than action, but that doesn't matter, because it would fail in either case. A viewer can accept the clichÃ© of the wrongly convicted man, but this case is deceptively against the grain. Our society already has a predisposition to acquit any man of murdering his wife, a predisposition to think it is impossible, when the statistics claim the opposite. For that reason alone, this movie is dangerous propaganda, and most often a lie. The characters never become believable, mostly because of the reason stated earlier. Also, because such men don't wind up in prison. The wrongly convicted man always comes from a different background and class. I can't imagine someone finding this movie even remotely plausible. In fact, the viewer has no idea what the 'redemption' is. Nothing makes any sense.",2,13,62,8 January 2007
Platoon," throwback to the old war movies with extra punch
","'Platoon' was definitely a throwback to the old war movies, with some extra punch added. It involves the characters more than most modern movies, and the characters are delineated. You can tell one from another in camera shots, unlike 'Hamburger Hill', which is a melange of shots in which you can't possibly tell one character from another. It involves a protagonist who is also a throwback to the old war movie, a man out of of his element, learning to deal with people he usually didn't. He is a 'rich kid', but a thoroughly likable, believable rich kid who does a lot of thinking. I'm sure you've already heard about the two NCOs whose names are synonyms for the kinds of soldiers they are 'Barnes' and 'Lyle'. The acting, directing, and writing are all exceptional. The action and dialogue mingle in a very entertaining, logical, and informative process. What the film also shows is the way of life in that era. It is hard to think about supporting the 'Barnes' point of view today in an era in which we are so well informed, but in the late sixties and seventies, when Americans were spoon fed only bits and pieces, even by the press (I was a high schooler then, and believe me, the war was downplayed. The killings and battles were described as small skirmishes then by the press.) Probably more than half of Americans would have been 'Barnes' supporters then, while his supporters today would be the rich mercantile types, the very naive, and the very uneducated (in other words, Republicans). However, when Barnes kills the granny, he probably would have a bit more than half against him, and the film depicts this. Make no mistake, Barnes is the epitome of evil, however. And other characters more in the middle probably reflect how most people would react, Particularly O'Neil, who probably represents the actions most of us would have taken. Anyone who ever thought about being in combat has felt positive they would have done exactly what he did in battle, and would have said exactly the same words he said afterwards. One thing lost is the captain's guilt in all of this. He proclaims that he will investigate and prosecute illegal killing, but then proclaims 'Not now!' and puts Lyle's life in jeopardy from his comrade quite knowingly. The captain is too smart to get caught, but his mercantile character should not be overlooked when teachers show this film to students. It is he, more than the junio officer, who is truly the 'butt buddy' of Sgt. Barnes, allowing Barnes to deal life and death and play God. The movie makes clear how he even cheats his friends. He is no comrade, and all his actions are meant to get his comrades killed. The mood of the film is also magnificent. And after seeing it, I can't imagine anyone hearing 'Sweat of My Tears' without thinking about it. The famous death scene of a certain main character gets the advertising it deserves for being so well made. I could go on for weeks about the assets of this film. The best war film since 'Jungle Fighters', which was made in the same spirit.",10,0,1,25 January 2007
Prometheus," Stage play style with too many effects
","This is a mixed bag. It's obviously the events that precede the ALIEN movie, with loose ends purposely implanted to show that there is more before and after.The acting and the characters are the strong point. Most of the characters are fairly likable and identifiable. This looks like pure stage drama in the script, which is good.However, the weaknesses really weaken the movie. The first and chief weakness is the kowtowing to the geeks with too many stupid special effects that just clutter up the story, and look like they're there just so Beavis and Butthead can guffaw at the gore and the many excessive actions full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.An apt quote, as there is a bit of King Lear in the drama. Not much, but a bit.This is a common weakness of modern movies. This movie also contains the second most common weakness of modern movies. You really need closed captioning, because you can't understand what the actors are saying most of the time. It's mostly poor enunciation from modern actors. That said, the actors did a decent job of emoting.It's watchable, and has a few good moments, and has a decent theatrical air. It's too bad it's cluttered up by poor modern film making.",7,1,5,12 September 2014
Wonder Woman," Back to basics
","The super hero movies have been rampant for a few decades. This one is about the Amazon beauty called Wonder Woman.The rage has usually been to go for blinding, numbing special effects and hate mongering demonic love, particularly with the Beavis and Butthead approach to the Batman series.This one goes back to basics. It has special effects, but they're on the side, not the front. There is too much use of special effects in this movie, but at least time out is taken for story and characters. And the love for demons isn't here. Instead, we get more of a mortal look at real people you can find credible.The gusto and bravery of the Amazon women is explained, so we can understand their fearlessness. When Wonder Woman meets the mortal men in combat, she finds a different credibility.In fact, this film is very symbolic of the times that the first world culture has entered. First world culture has produced a slew of bubble boys who think they are as fearless as the Amazon tribe. One way to identify these bubble boys and girls is if they claim they would be like the Amazon women or the other fearless characters. If so, they've labeled themselves as the very people this film is identifying.So, the creators of this film let them stand in with Wonder Woman herself, to see the frailty of Man. Unfortunately, the point will be moot with these viewers. They will not see themselves among the mortals. They'll continue in their bubbles. Still, this film does make the effort.As of this date, most Americans, most first world people, at least those who don't live in poverty, haven't an inkling about the horrors of war. Oh, they claim they know, and love the hate mongering demon worshiping movies, but if they really had pain in their lives, they wouldn't need to look for pain. In fact, most of them will not like this film, because it isn't demonic enough for them. Hopefully, they can stay in their bubbles and never know horror.But this is a pretty good film. I would rather see fewer special effects. Less dulling play from special effects people. I suppose they have to prove they can do it, but it is dull. Sane viewers, like myself, would rather see the story and characters.",7,0,5,2 November 2017
X-Men: First Class," Something for everyone
","As a kid, I collected some comics, mostly ADVENTURE from DC about the Legion of Super Heroes, some Superman, and from Marvel, some Fantastic Four.DC was known as better heroes, while Marvel was known as 'better characters'.In those days, those were about the only two real choices. The India Ink artistry was unbeatable. And it was the days before hacks began drawing pictures which had every hero with a 90 inch chest.So, I'm not a die-hard comic fan, but I'm not a completely free agent, either. I see this film from both sides, roughly, but mostly from the middle.This super hero film has something for everyone, I believe. It seems to stay fairly true to the comics, as I recall, certainly to the emphasis on characters.For non comic fans, it has good characters.The directing, I think, helps a lot. There really seems to be an emphasis on only two characters, with a brief attempt to show glimpses of three other characters, and a very small hint at four other characters at the very most. The others may as well be called 'Extra Number One, Two, and so forth'.Really, it is about two characters. They aren't brothers, but they behave as brothers. They are in the founding father days of a super hero group.Charles is the charismatic one, the one you would expect to be the older brother if they were brothers. He is mature and composed. He even reminds me of my older brother.Alex is the more emotional one. He has a good heart, and has good intentions, but one could say he has a 'dark side'. He isn't evil, but he isn't 'good'. There is one time when I believe he crosses the line. They are teaching a young man how to use his power of vocalization to fly, and Alex pushes him to a certain doom if he doesn't use his voice correctly. In the comic world, it's acceptable as 'sink or swim', but in 'sink or swim', you can always toss a line to a drowning man. I suppose here that Alex had a back up plan to use his power to somehow save the poor boy if he 'sank'.At the climax, Alex has a bout with Humanity, in which he seems to want to kill a beautiful young woman for a bullet that hits someone he cares for. He obviously never intends to really kill her, but to coax another character to stop him, as he takes his time. Many of us have been in this 'someone stop me' situation before.What I think is best is the work done on the five characters they explore. However, I think that's laziness for a full length film to only explore five characters to this degree. Even many of the 'heroes' and 'villains' are just fillers, basic extras.What I didn't care for were the action scenes. Again, a film has to have something for everyone. And special effects are needed for the geeks. I did like the simplicity of some of them, however. This made it more of a good balance of action and character.The weakest moments were the action moments. At one point, the villains wipe out the self important CIA team and the guards. It wasn't badly done. It was overly done, though. It seems to have been a case of 'lets give the dorks in the audience some more silly bloodthirsty killing scenes'. Fortunately, this was a small part of the film, and looked to be just an effort to appease the dorks.The direction for establishing the two central characters was outstanding, no doubt about it. We get Alex and Charles in reaction to almost everything, sometimes in unison, sometimes in differences.",8,1,1,23 September 2013
Tombstone," Lame spaghetti without the cool music
","Make no mistake, this is just another goofy spaghetti western, but without the great music that makes people think such westerns are good. One of the worst things about this one is the false bravado of try9ing to look like the real story. It is so Hollywood skewed that it lacks any entertainment value. First, the characters. This is where the film fell flat on its face. In the spaghetti western, there is just one character, each with different names and faces, but all the same character, the self righteous, unbelievably self confident superman (or buy who thinks he's Superman.) The trouble with this is, these characters would all be dead by believing they could fly off a cliff from day one. This movie gives a second character, the Virgil Earp. There are a few like him, but the script is so badly written, you realize these are just the same character, too. There is the ridiculous character, and the stereotype civilized character. That is it. And it is way too obvious and ridiculous to accept even in a fantasy land. We want to like Wyatt and Doc, the two main characters, but in Hollywood tradition, the director and writers do the worst job they can. This might be an example of how not to write or direct a movie. A few good actors and clever camera men try to salvage this, but to no avail. Doc and Wyatt are the same person. No difference. The same Hollywood hype Superman with an impossible to believe Superiority Complex. With such a complex, their trivial interests are impossible to believe. In Hollywood tradition, only the most unlikable of characters survive to the end, so no one ever watches the end, except for a few masochists. Even worse than what are usually inferior spaghetti westerns, because this lacks the great music. If this is not on a critic's worst 200 list, he's been bribed or is pulling your leg.

The Deer Hunter," not very interesting, but realistic drama of citizens who want to serve
","This is not a captivating movie by any sense. It doesn't hold your interest, and is best seen in clumps. That said, it gives a half way accurate, realistic viewpoint of regular working folks during the Viet Nam War. How it affects them, before they see war, and afterwards. There are liberties taken. For instance, the three home town buddies are assigned together in Viet Nam. I've been in the Air Force, and that's just not something that is done. I'm sure the other branches are the same way. But that is poetic license. The chief character, De Niro, descends into madness. He begins with a very stable attitude. The sort of character you feel won't go berserk.That is what the script intended. He is the stable force, or at least the outwardly stable force. When he returns from the war, he has changed. On his regular hunting trips he reveals the change, until fellow hunter, Cazale, who plays a likable bum, irritates him into near insanity. De Niro issues his famous line 'This is this!' And of course it is an insane line, but just the sort of line such a man would say. Not for someone who wants a lot of action. In fact, the hunting trip scenes are more interesting than the war scenes. Still, a very good psychological portrayal, and excellent acting make this one what it is. And if you like those qualities more than entertainment and action, this could be the movie for you.",4,2,3,25 March 2007
The Producers," pothead cult choice with one gag
","I remember the 'old days' when the pothead cult determined this to be classic; like Jimmi Hendrix and SNL, you weren't cool if you didn't adore these things, which of course made you all the more dorky when you succumbed to the pressure. The movie was a one gag stunt then, just as it is now. The premise is two guys try to make money by producing a bomb stage play, selling investments at about 1000%, intending on a bomb with no revenue to pay off, pocketing the money. This is one of those ideas that don't even sound good on paper. One of those ideas that a couple of kids with IQs of 25 combined come up with. That is the joke. A mild ha ha at best. Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, and Dick Shawn, as well as the subordinate players, make the most of it. Its the sort of stage play that relies 100% on the actors, because the script is void. And the cast is one of the better ones brought together. And Mel Brooks does what he can, but if you want a movie to make you laugh, you really have to strain to smile through this.",3,5,18,22 December 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Tough call
","There are a few ways to look at this new addition to the STAR WARS Universe, the seventh in the series, and this time in the proper sequence.First of all, it's the value of the story itself.One of the basic mistakes of story telling is related to us by Chaucer in early literature. The miller tells a tale, which good or bad, is what it is, and is well received, and brings spirits up.Then the reeve is enraged, and tells a tale of spite, doing nothing more than sabotaging the first story.That's what the 'prequels' came across as. As reeve's tales.Fortunately, we get no 'reeve's tale' here. This is a story on its own merits.However, most will observe the obvious, that there is a repeating of History to some effect.And that's part of the story, and part of what 'troubles' at least one of the original characters.It isn't a complete repeat of History, but it is enough so that a chief character is so depressed that he hides away, and this seventh story is a quest to find him, along with some side stories.Another important thing to remember about this seventh adventure in this Universe is that while I review it, in the last days of 2015 A.D., it is perceived as being a copy of an earlier film, which is understandable.However, in 2065 A.D., and in 2115 A.D., it will be judged on its own merits, which is what makes this a 'tough call'.For those living now, we aren't so impressed with the dialog, and that's not a knock on the dialog. It's certainly better than most movie dialog. Unfortunately, the first Star Wars spawned 'iconic' lines and situations, and today, there are just so many control freaks who think they are the ones to decide the new iconic lines, that everyone else is just shouted down.Watching the film, it was apparent to me that there was no intention of 'iconic' lines, or of the 'hard hitting' lines. Instead, it looked like more of an attempt to fit into the natural order of this Universe, and then let what may happen just simply happen.And that's a good call. There are simply going to be 'haters' at this stage.In thinking over the past decades of how I would write the story, I must say I'm very impressed. It is almost exactly the way I would write it, the way it needed to be written.More cannot be said on that without a spoiler, other than to expound on a few characters.First, a tragic character who buys the farm. It was well done, not only being dramatic and theatrical, but also being natural in the order of events. It pretty much needed to go this way. It was a fatality that we felt, and that was good, because a death should affect us.Second, the villain. The new Darth Vader was exceptional. Abrams and team gave us a modern Bogie. Bogart was the champion of the portrayal of the 'villain with insecurities', and that's what we get here. The most believable and three dimensional villain of the Star Wars Universe to date.In this new villain, we see hints of Bogie villains from THE CAINE MUTINY, TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, PETRIFIED FOREST, DEAD END, even BLACK LEGION. (PETRIFIED FOREST, Bogie is not so much insecure as in a corner, and we get that here).I don't know if Abrams did this intentionally, but I think someone on the team did.Third, the heroine is exceptional and perfectly done. She has an 'inconspicuous beauty', one we saw in the golden age of films. A natural beauty without a lot of adornments or make up. Being 'conspicuous' is dangerous in battles, cause it makes you a likelier target, which is why action heroines and heroes of the golden age tended to be 'inconspicuous'. Also, the heroine has great fire and motivation, plus what looks to be heart.Fourth, Finn is exceptional. A great fugitive storm trooper who doesn't want to be part of this 'Universe', which makes him much like Luke. One can see this playing out much like the similar characters of SEVEN SAMURAI (Rikiki and Toshiro Mifune's anonymous character), with an understanding of each other, yet a contempt. Great screen writing here.Another point is the relationships. They're well done, and the quick latching onto relationships is okay, because people here are in distress. The old romance between the aging hero and heroine of the first trilogy is great to see, too, as we get a lot of interesting relationships here, which makes this movie much better, technically, than any of the previous ones.The scenery is also very majestic, and not overdone. An 'A' for that.Time will tell if the rating will go up or down, but I'm speaking about real time, not the mere 20 or 30 years that some of the uneducated believe. I mean 100 years or so. For now, it works quite well. I expect this to be well received.Except by the 'reeve' types.",9,3,23,24 December 2015
Rear Window," Even Hitchcock pulls some boners
","Hitchcock is obviously one of the best directors, if not the best, of all time, and Stewart is one of the greatest actors. However, they've made over a hundred films between them, and there are a couple of clunkers. This is one. The suspense exists, and mystery, so we are told. However, it is not possible to know this first hand, because no creature on Earth can sit through the movie. This is because it has the worst and most annoying sound effects ever in any movie. Hitchcok certainly wanted the audience to twist and hate the noise, but there is considerable overkill here. A human's nerves can't take this horrible noise and concentrate on what is going on. Even if you sit through it, you don't know what is going on, because you are in way too much pain. Some people insist they can watch it, but it isn't possible without drugs. I wonder what drugs they are taking? A normal person would need two and a half strong Valiums to even begin to sit through this. Not watchable.",3,9,36,10 March 2007
Godzilla," Ho hum
","Hard to believe that a Godzilla movie could be dull, but this is dull. 
The production team makes the mistake of modern movie making. They try to confuse the audience with a bunch of special effects that make you feel the headache of an annoying arcade or a goofy casino full of those annoying lights flashing over and over.
Pretty much everything is contrived for the sake of what little the writer and director have in mind. We never feel we're there. We only feel we're in the presence of people making a movie, and that's a poor sign.
If you can stay awake for the first two hundred years of this movie (it will seem like two hundred years), you'll finally see a monster. 
The biggest problem is we just get the same characters over and over. Hollywood thinks all men have to be married with families, or they're worthless garbage. Again and again, we are alienated by Hollywood 'superiority' complexes.
Not pathetic, but this movie is tedious and annoying.",3,0,3,22 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Old fashioned fun
","I remember when this movie first appeared. It was marketed as a throwback to the old Errol Flynn movies, and Luke Skywalker, at this juncture, was considered the main character. Instead of swinging on a mast rope on a pirate ship like Flynn would, Hamill would swing on a cable inside a vast space ship complex, carrying the princess with him.This is space adventure. Despite the hype, the other movies hadn't been formulated yet, even if the germs were in the back of the head honcho's mind. This was groundbreaking, not because of effects, but because of many other chances it took. In a decade when most heroes had to have black hair, and heroines blonde hair, and everyone else was considered unworthy of life, this film dared to go against the grain, and give us two blonde haired men for heroes. It's a wonder it wasn't censored on the drawing board.The two major stars in the picture, when it was released, were Oscar winner Alec Guiness and horror film star Peter Cushing. Guiness was a huge star. Cushing was known for playing Baron Frankenstein and the vampire killer, Von Helsing, in numerous films. He also played an assortment of British scholar characters. Here, he is a despicable bad guy.The Skywalker character was at center stage. He was the kid who must go off on adventure, and finds a mentor in Obi One Kenobe, played by Guiness. There is non stop action and adventure in a very industrialized Universe in which space travel is easier than a walk to the park. It isn't a Scientific think piece, but rather a 'sit back and enjoy the story' affair.",9,1,2,16 August 2008
300," better than the trailers make it look
","I actually didn't expect to like this movie after seeing the previews. Most previews take the best part of movies and leave a lot of flatness. This one was vice versa. The previews give an indication of the fallacies of this movie. The director tried to emulate Japanese classics too much. The easy flowing ballet like movements make the battle scenes too comical. It may work in a one on one confrontation when you're dealing with characters who are personifications instead of real people (as in THE FOUR ASSASSINS), but it is ridiculous when dealing with historical people. As far as historical accuracy, literary leeway is always given, and this film deviates as much as any film. First, the Persians in the movie were depicted as Africans. Persians (Iranians) were not black. This was probably done because the director wanted to cast certain people. Also, Xerxes was not eleven feet tall, and rhinos were not bigger than train cars. This, again, is bad film directing. Apparently, the director wants to give the impression that the Spartans saw them this way, but it really doesn't fit into the Spartan character. Another fallacy is the deformed character. The film tries to indicate that the Spartans practiced good science in knowing when a baby would grow up weak. They had no such science, and the odds of a baby being left alone to die, still surviving, and yet being weaker than the Spartans was frankly impossible. That said, the film was better than I anticipated. The characters were fairly likable and as complex as characters of that age could be. Xerxes was depicted as a rather likable despot, one who didn't have the modern day sadistic side that any other movie maker would have given him, but wouldn't have fit in an ancient world that never heard of sadism. I didn't care for the narration part, but it didn't really alter my rating. In fact, disregard most of the critiques. Many of them praise the wrong thing. The film lacked artistry and had bad action scenes, but the dramatics and characters were well defined.",6,0,0,21 December 2007
Fantastic Four," Very true to Marvel comics and lot of upside
","Whenever you see a movie which so many people hate or love so much, the truth is somewhere in between (usually). for this one, the hate mongers are pretty much in their own little world, and whatever they hate is too personal for them to describe, because this movie was extremely true to the comic book (for the most part), it was entertaining, action packed, and focused on the characters. Quite frankly, though I'm not an ardent fan, I can't find fault with this film. The comic book Fantastic Four focused on the characters even more than the powers. The genius Reed who can stretch his body as if there were no bones, but like the blob of the movies; the Invisible Woman, his wife Sue, the glue who keeps them together; and the rivalry between the superstrong grotesque Ben and the Hollywood fireball Johnny Storm. The movie doesn't deviate at all from these characters. Like the comic, it focuses on them. The comic book had several bad guys who fought them. And as in one famous comic quote, there is no law against trying to take over the world, and the Thing's famous response 'that wouldn't do much good against Galactus, though. He don't want to take over the world, he just wants to eat it.' Since Galactus was the most interesting of the villains, and Annihilus the second most, and then there were still the Frightful Four, the Mole Man, the Molecule Man, and others more powerful than Doom, a lot of people may have wanted them in the movie, but Doom was the personal enemy of Reed and his three friends. So the first movie would have to deal with Dr. Doom. And since the comic book was also famous for exposing the vast differences in character between the villains, one movie would not do justice to the comic. It will take several movies. For instance, while Doom was famous for being a psychopathic sort who mistreated those loyal to him, Annihilus would be rewarding for his yes men, and Galactus would merely place them where he thought best like an emotionless business syndicate. The Fantastic Four is about characters, and about mistakes, real live mistakes, heat of the moment decisions, and what they can cost us, and how Reed would realize his mistakes and try to learn from them. The movie covered that, and gave us the appeal of Grimm and Storm, whose antics made the comic even greater. This movie falls into place. In time, it may depend upon the sequels to give it a higher rating.",7,0,0,6 May 2007
The Great Escape," Dull, fad following, cliché of a flop
","This movie is about a massive escape from a German prison camp. Unlike the fast paced and intriguing 'Stalag 17', this movie is plodding, dull, and yet no more realistic. Everyone looks squeaky clean, which already makes it lack any of the realism of the Holden-Brand classic.A lot of big name stars are in this, led by the contemplative Richard Attenborough. The film tries to draw us into the lives of James Garner and Steve McQueen, but loses us terribly. Every war cliché is in this movie. And the director probably caved in to McQueen's insistence upon the use of motor vehicles, giving us another stupid, boring motorcycle chase no one cares about, except McQueen's red neck club. Even Garner has to get into the driving act by somehow getting a German plane. So much for realism. To top it off, we are treated to the usual cliché of kill the nearsighted man, Hollywood's favorite whipping post, and the subject of heinous prejudice unequaled.You really have to plod through this ordeal. You won't really care about anything or anyone, and will try to occasionally watch between around the house chores, but don't bother. It isn't worth it.",2,21,57,22 February 2008
Click," Perfect example of how not to make a movie
","This movie had no good points. I won't comment on the acting (apart from leads), since its unfair to judge them by horrible writing and directing. The script is mundane and watery-a very processed looking, you've seen it all before, ho hum affair. Family man who has everything, wants to fast forward through his perfect life (explain that!) He has a gorgeous wife, money, family, health, home, everything in the American dream, and he whines about it! That's Adam Sandler of course. He's not a likable character. Granted, a better actor may have made him somewhat more likable. We do have modern day Cary Grants, but Sandler is unable to take that part. He just comes across as too 'I'm a superior creature to the viewer'. The laughs are struggled for, and quite predicable. Courteous viewers will give some scenes the benefit of the doubt, but they'll be straining hard to actually smile.",1,2,8,11 December 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Warning-you could laugh yourself to death
","You really could laugh yourself to death watching this movie. It is nothing but hilarious. Monty Python keeps pounding and pounding you with gag after gag, and lead you down a road, but suddenly its a bridge, no, its an ocean. One of the things that really makes this hilarious is the grand spectacle that dazzles you with attention to grand sound effects, and then the next scene may be purposely cheap sets, all to make you laugh yourself to death. There is crude humor, and what I think can fairly be described as dark humor-you might not think its funny to see an animal with big teeth rip several knights to death, or a knight have his arms and legs cut off, but Monty Python will make you laugh at it. I personally think they're akin to Marx Brothers comedy, or Mel Brooks-hilarious with likable people in outrageous situations.",10,14,22,14 December 2006
Sin City," Storyboard sketcher with no imagination
","Sin City is another example of how not to make a movie. It relies completely on highlight scenes to be shown in trailers. There's no comment on the acting because the script doesn't call for acting, just a bunch of lines thrown together. As near as I could make out the plot is just about revenge, over and over and over, which would make it attractive to adolescents, but the script is so bad, and the plot so badly delineated, that it can only qualify as a farce. However, the farce is hampered by poor directing, which makes it look only serious. It tries to get by on block looks and the one moderately funny scene where a guy is being dragged by a car; and looks like a drawing. In effect, its the result of a good sketch artist for storyboards with no imagination, creativity, or talent. If you watch it any way, don't say I didn't warn you. I do challenge anyone to stay awake and watch it in one sitting. I don't think it can be done by any animal.",2,7,15,4 April 2006
The Cabin in the Woods," Better to die like a soldier than live like a coolie
","Whedon and Goddard changed my mind about all Hollywood writers being hacks. These two knew their craft.There is much to this film, and one has to stick it out, because it begins with as big a cliché of horror as one can get, and that's intentional because of the story here, which is actually many symbolic stories rolled into one.I probably wouldn't have continued watching had I not intended to critique it, and that's why I'm not a fan of modern story telling. In order to be produced, one must do as these two writers do, 'unfold' the story. I don't like being manipulated, and Christianity dictates not to 'manipulate', and that's why this story is as Christian as one can get, albeit a more Gnostic Christian story than usual. It shows up 'manipulation'.How to tell of this film without spoilers? I think some things need to be said. But I won't reveal any 'real spoiler', other than a lot of what you see that you think is off subject, is actually right on target.There are allusions here to many films, but mostly to THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The evil Japanese commander in that film states:BETTER TO DIE LIKE A SOLDIER THAN LIVE LIKE A COOLIEAnd our five young people do that. They encounter danger, and of course the first fatality has no idea of the danger, just as if five people walk through their football field, and suddenly one steps on a mine. The first one can have no clue as to the reality, and so the others learn more and more as they go along.Remember that quote from KWAI. It has meaning. Because the surface of the story is about five young people who are the usual five who enter the horror story, so much so that we can almost sense the writing team has something else in mind, if they're truly writers, and they don't disappoint us.I don't give this a 10/10 yet, because before I give a film that, it must digest and pass a test of time with me.This film will be relevant as long as we have IMDb bubble boys, and those are the ones who are put down most by this film.The film is 'anti-horror' instead of 'horror'.There are many levels of symbolism here. For example, there is an 'army symbolism' here. The five young people are 'sacrificed' in a way by the 'officer characters'.And the writers are careful to show that of the main 'office' characters relegating the action, only two are 'officers' who have the ideology of the Hellish game, while the others are symbolic of the squadron clerks, maintenance, mechanics, the support people doing their job. One girl, maybe the closest of the 'enlisted' to the 'officers' even states that while the officer characters are 'celebrating', she is 'drinking'. That line, among others, has more significance than the casual observer might realize.The 'sacrifice' angle is shown for what it is, too. We see the officer characters demanding to be in complete control, even of the order of fatalities.And the five young people do their best. They are given labels of 'nerd', 'virgin' and other labels, labels which for one of them proves to be the ultimate irony.We see other cultures playing the same control game with young people, but not to the degree the Americans do. Again, there is more being stated here than meets the eye. The modern American, in a worship of evil, in considering cannibals immortal, serial killers undying, homicidal maniacs gifted, the bubble boy horror fan who worships this idea, is the exact opposite of the American revolutionaries Patrick Henry and Thomas Payne. The exact opposite.Back in the 1960s I remember kids playing make believe, and there would always be the older control freak kid who made each invisible door release an even bigger demon to defeat, just to torment the other kids. And I've no doubt that there were such control freaks in 1960 B.C. doing the same.According to the film, people have been subjecting themselves to this for ages. And it became a religion to those who have the worst outlook on good and evil. 'Fair is foul and Foul is Fair', except these maniacs take it to mean spiritual 'fair and foul' being the opposite.A lot of this is explored. And pay attention to the Japanese girls. Because there is more symbolism here. They represent the total opposite of what the American ideology is. Again, I refer to the quote in the classic war film given above.In the end, I won't say if it's some of the original five young people, or some of the other characters, but two of them are given the choice to continue playing the game, and they fall for it for a while, because they believe the lies that it will save humanity, when in fact, all it does is keep humanity in slavery.I hope I haven't 'spoiled' anything. I would rather a first time viewer just keep an open mind throughout, and wait till the end.",9,0,3,18 November 2015
Windtalkers," should have been much better
","Usually when someone says 'The trouble with this is...' you'll hear a lie, because they want to hush you up. But it hard to talk about this movie without saying 'The trouble with this is...'. The movie should have been good. It's about the use of a little known Navajo language to used as radio codes in World War Two to prevent the enemy from cracking the code. Navajo soldiers are used to communicate with Allied forces, and each is assigned a mercenary soldier to protect them, or to kill them in case of capture. As stated before, this movie is really about Nicholas Cage and his heroics. The entire plot is very contrived, and in true Hollywood style, anyone you could care a thing about is killed very early, so a viewer has to trudge through this film. Unless you're doing a critique, you won't sit through it. A film like this should have been much better. The fault is horrendous writing, and writing is the most important aspect to many of us.",2,1,2,16 February 2008

","The Breakfast Club is a movie people put in to view to make their guests leave. It is undoubtedly the greatest waste of great music since The Graduate. Like the Graduate, it has non believable characters who aren't interesting and a lame expository plot line. Two things make this movie remarkably bad. First, it takes what should have been a good idea, showing the ideas of a group of characters, and instead using a whole movie to turn them into ridiculous stereotypes. It becomes evident early on, however, that this is told from the point of view of the one character who is too tough for that (if you ever notice, when someone recounts an event, the one constant is that the narrator is always tough and decisive), which brings us to the second major flaw. The character who tells the story is a whiny brat with an unbelievable superiority complex which most teenagers certainly can't relate to, who gets everything his own way or else, and does nothing but belittle and mock everyone else. Probably the worst script ever.",1,13,34,5 April 2006
Contact," Bombastic and preachy
","The trouble with movies that obviously cater to the most radical and violent of atheists is that you get a script like this, which is ten times as 'preachy' as the loudest Southern Baptist evangelist.It's loosely a story about a very boring woman who is going to perhaps go into space. On the other hand, she has a rival played by Tom Skeritt, who may be the one who goes out into space.The notion that she is refused to go on the trip because she is an atheist is not only contrived, but delusional. If anything, opportunity is denied to theists in the real world, never to atheists. Proof of this can be seen on the internet by the constant whining against theism, but none against atheism.Everything about the story is 'contrived', and predictable if you are believing a first grade drop out wrote this. It's just another of the usual atheist preaching from a pulpit in a retarded way. How is it retarded? To say it without a spoiler, I'll say that the story first claims atheists are superior, wise, and correct, and yet then says that there is a cognitive force at work to destroy all theists.Yes, it is that retarded.",2,6,16,15 June 2014
High Fidelity," no talent
","This is dull. It's supposed to be a comedy, and you can see the actors try, but they look like people reading lines and doing what a director or writer tells them to do.It's very sad, and you could feel sorry for them if they were doing this on a small budget.However, this is a group of rich kids who make a movie, and don't have a thimbleful of talent between them. The script is dull, the directing is deplorable, and the acting is nonexistent.Most of the movie seems to be some grown up rich brat whining and griping about something. If you can stay awake long enough, you'll not find anything at all interesting about it.The lead actor is so bad, I won't even name him. He looks like someone who truly just memorized words to say on screen.Much of the fault is the director, who simply does every cliché he can think of, and has exactly zero ingenuity and zero creativity.Which brings us to the writers of the book and screenplay. I certainly won't bother reading the book, as dull as this is, so I won't affirm the book writer has no talent, but it would be hard to believe.The trouble here is that we live in a day and age when everyone thinks he is an artist and writer. Forty years ago, people knew what they were. Farmers could farm, welders could weld, and some people could do two or three things well.Today, people who should be farming or roofing are writing bland scripts. They are highly regarded only because they are competing solely against other rich kids who should be welding or gardening. The naturally talented and trained writers are the first casualties of the 'board room' decisions, because everyone in the board room has a dull script, and they only want to compete against other dull scripts. They have to weed out the best ones first.This is why we get so few comedies that we can naturally laugh at today.Usually, it's only the writing that suffers in modern movie making. What makes this movie especially bad is that whomever did the casting had absolutely no clue. One gets the feeling the cast were all relatives and friends. I won't comment on the ones with small roles, because the movie is already ruined by the stars. This was incredibly amateur. I could find elementary school kids who could put on a better show.If you can stay awake through this, you are truly an Insomniac.",2,2,5,22 June 2012
