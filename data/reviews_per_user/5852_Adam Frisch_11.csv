Alien 3," Gains on you.
","I'm a devoted fan to the Alien saga. I do think the first one in the series is by far the better one and it really holds up well today. Aliens hasn't stod the test of time that well, much of the dialogue and characters feel very 80's to me. But it has a tremendous drive and action and can not be ignored. Alien 3 was hated upon its arrival, and David Fincher had endless fights with 20th Century Fox over the storyline (the script wasn't finished and new pages arrived daily to the set). Considering this turbulence, and that he had to change DP midway through it due to Fox's impatience with the slow shooting style from original cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth, Fincher delivered a masterpiece. It really holds up very well, and is perhaps the most character driven entry of the whole series. There's even a hinted love story in there. This film needs to be re-discovered by Alien fans. Few films deserve it more.",Null,1,3,15 February 2002
Blade," I'm all over it.
","The spectacular opening scene blew me away. And although I can't tell you this is a 'good' film and keep a straight face, it nevertheless is just that. If you're willing to leave the brain at the door, that is. Good mindless fun, great fight sequences and a kicking score! If you missed it in theaters, be sure to get the jam-packed DVD, 'cause it's one of the best.",Null,0,1,29 November 1999
Alien," The most visually influental movie ever.
","Talk about trendsetter! Don't believe all the nonsense from all those theme-park minds claiming that Aliens is a much better film! It's no way near. If you don't believe me rent both films 10 years from now. Alien will hold forever, whereas Aliens doesn't even hold water today. Don't get me wrong, Aliens is not a bad movie, not at all, but it's an action movie, not an inventive horror movie. Alien invented the dark, greasy, claustrophobic look everyone's been stealing since. Because there's one problem with guys like Jim Cameron (and Spielberg); They know how to make lots of money and that's it. Period. They'll never be Ridley Scott or Stanley Kubrick, no matter how many Shindler's or Titanics they make. Don't get suckered in, see the true original.",Null,0,1,8 May 1999
U-571," Leni Riefenstahl?
","Spoilers! Is it any wonder America makes enemies worldwide when they shove this kind of revisionist history down our throats? It's an insult to everyone, even Americans. And what really, really makes me break down and cry, is that this dreck was seen by millions of Americans and yet hardly anyone over there has seen the submarine movie that all others should be measured against: Das Boot.From the false notion that an American crew captured the Enigma machine, to the countless scenes where german U-boat men are depicted as cold blooded killers, this film is the a Triumph Of The Will for Americans. A propaganda film if I ever saw one! Shame on them.",Null,1,3,21 January 2002
Aliens," Take a good look at it again.
","Just the other day I rewatched The Untouchables, a film I remember as fantastic. Phew, what 10 years can do to a film! The same thing is the case with Aliens. It used to be one of my favourites, but now, it just feels so clich√©ed, dated, unfunny and soo Cameron. I beg you, rewatch it today, and I'm sure you'll agree with me: this film has not stood the test of time.So, quickly emerging as the next best in the series is actually Alien3, a movie that has unfairly been looked upon as a the weakest in the series. Once again, watch it again, and I'm sure you'll find what I did, a really good movie for adults.",Null,0,1,12 August 2001
The Elephant Man," Breaks my heart every time.
","I recently revisited this film when it aired on television again. It's still one of the most heartwrenching and powerful tributes to humankind. This should be required viewing for those who seek an exemplification of tolerance and humanity. And I also much prefer David Lynch's directing style when he's in this mode, this film and The Straight Story is his best work, no doubt. This sad story of the deformed John Merrick is nothing short of a masterpiece.",Null,0,0,22 September 2001
K-19: The Widowmaker," Unjustly maligned - this a great film!
","I've always been a big fan of Kathryn Bigelow. I've loved every single one of her movies, no exceptions. Yet I stayed away from this one since I'd heard so much bad about it. The trailer wasn't very good either. But I am a confessed submarine-movie nut, so eventually I'd have to give in - I recently got it on DVD and gave it a chance.And I was royally impressed! It's a great, honest and human story told. Can not understand why it was so maligned and ridiculed - is it because it tells a story from a Russian POW, or is it because Harrison Ford's character is flawed? I don't know, all I know is it's a very good film and you should give it a try just like I did. You won't be disappointed.Or to paraphrase a line from the film (in regards to its critics): 'Who needs honors from men like that?'",8,1,2,29 May 2005
Where Eagles Dare," Nailbiting.
","This film shall not be missed. Why? Well, because this is one of the first true action films (I wish more of today's directors would learn from it), brim-filled with plotwists, explosions and Nazis. Richard Burton does one of his best performances as the double-sided leader of a group set out to free a prisoner of war. Ron Goodwin's masterful score is his absolute best, and has been copied time and time again. Poor Ron, he only got to compose 'military' types of scores for the remainder of his career. But at that he was very good. If all this doesn't intrigue you, then buy it or rent it, just for the sake of watching Clint Eastwood as a young lad.",Null,2,2,13 December 1998
The Matrix Reloaded," I can't believe I'm wasting time telling you how bad this is.
","SPOILERS AHEAD, BEWARE.I will now list all the tepid, fungal, worthless, clueless, boring, predictable anomalities of this rancid brew in no particular order:Why didn't Neo just fly the hell away from the million agent Smiths that kept coming at him? Why did he stay for 10 minutes to fight all the clones and THEN fly away?If Neo isn't the chosen one as they conclude, then why can he stop bullets? ...And if he can stop bullets, then why can't he stop other things? Like agents?How many more times do I have to sit though an endless crawling of text in the credits accompanied with yet another yelling and screaming song by Rob Zombie, only to see a boring sales pitch for the last installment?After the Merovingan acts real bad ass and threatens Neo, he just....walks off?Could Morpheus please make sense anytime soon? Little tip to the screenwriters: saying things like 'I had a dream and now it's gone' isn't deep. Promise.Wire Fu. The fights were just endless and futile passes of block, kick, block, block, kick. Utterly boring. Hire Jackie Chan as choreographer next time. At least he's inventive.The 10-minute Zion rave. Enough said.Jada Pinkett Smith. Enough said.Trinity. A sultry, inexpressive broad in rubber. What the hell does he see in her that makes him love her so? She's just hollow - I dare anyone to tell me what her character is. Yet another striking showing of this was how the gorgeous Monica Belucci steels all Trinity's thunder - in the space of 2 minutes she manages to bring more character to the screen than Trinity will do over three installments.As the fall of Zion is reported at the very end - hey, the most important storyline in the whole damn picture, ther very reason for all their efforts, is dealt with in two lines of dialogue. What's even worse; Link, who's wife was in Zion and who had some considerable screen time pleading Link not to go on this dangerous mission, well, he doesn't even react to the bad news that Zion has fallen (and therefore presumably his wife and his nieces and sisters).All the 3D in the effects make the whole film look like a Nintendo-game.And a little tip to effects guys; just because you've done Neo as a 3D guy, doesn't mean you have to do 360 traveling shots around him in EVERY scene. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.Slip the Wachowski's another mickey and stay away from the 'conclusion' come december. That's my tip.",Null,0,0,26 May 2003
Heat," Hated it the first time, but then.....
","Since, I've seen it at least 20 times and it just gets better and better! It's now taking the coveted 2:nd spot on my personal all-time-high film list, just after The Godfather II. Despite the fact that Al Pacino gets dangerously close to overacting in some scenes. Michael Mann is a complete genius! Do not miss his earlier work, like Manhunter (based on Thomas Harris 'Silence of the Lambs' book, but much better), Thief, Last of the Mohicans and The Keep. This guy is going to go down in history as one of the greatest directors, believe me....",10,0,0,8 May 1999
The Thin Red Line," Thin Red is all Ryan wanted to be.
","First; I'm not american. But that doesn't make me an arty eurofilm lover. Quite the contrary; I love american movies.But in that final shot of Saving Private Ryan, when that sole american flag waved in slo-mo in closeup, it made me sick. I'll be the first to admit that USA saved us europeans from Hitlers terror, and we are forever grateful for that. But that last shot ruined everything, because what Spielberg told us was in fact this; The only ones who paid the great price on the 'altar of freedom' were americans. The 20 million russians or the 6 million french and the countless brits (and germans) that did the same are, by that ending, reduced to nothing. So only american parents lost someone they loved? Frankly, it's an insult.And that's why The Thin Red Line is such a masterful film. Because it tells that whoever dies, we all lose. There's no winning in war. So what's new, you might ask? We all know war is hell. Yeah, but this is the first war movie I've ever seen where that's made the sole point. All the other ones SHOW you war is hell, but ultimately TELLS you that it's 'worth the sacrifice in the end'. No such thing here. And that is why people are going to keep talking about this masterpiece long after the negative to SPR is lost.Do I have to add that there isn't a single bad performance in the film? Or that the cinematography is going to win an Oscar?",10,0,0,18 February 1999
