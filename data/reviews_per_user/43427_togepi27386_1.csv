Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A GREAT MOVIE !!!!!!
",I just want to say that Star Wars Episode 1 was great. At first i didn't want to see it but my family made me and i really liked it i went and saw it twice. I thought that the graphics were great the music was SUPERB i love the 'DUEL OF THE FATES' To anyone who are getting let down by other peoples comments and disappointed it is up to you what you think. The characters are also great like Ewan Mc-Gregor as Obi-wan Kenobi and Liam Neeson as Quigon Jinn and i just want to say one more thing and that is that i think Jar-Jar Binks was a funney character every movie need's a funney character like in the originals R2-D2 + C3-P0 + Chewbacc were all the funney one's there.Plus i can't wait to the next two movies.,Null,22,34,23 February 2000
