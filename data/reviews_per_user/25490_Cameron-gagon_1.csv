The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," worst movie ever.
","This was the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. To give this a rating, i would put in my top five-hundred favorite movies and i have only seen a total of three-hundred movies in my lifetime. The acting was terrible in this movie. I have seen Robert Patterson in better movies and they have been great movies I have enjoyed. Twilight was not one of them. I have to admit this has the best acting and make-up, but still didn't quite make it for me. I watched that screen for a total of about 45 minutes. I was really angry to see Bella on top of Edward for half of the movie making out with him and making love with him. It was too much of me to handle. It got pretty scandalous and graphic for me as well. I laughed at most of the sad parts because of how funny everybody's reaction was in the movie and how terrible they were in reacting. I would not recommend any guy to go see it at any time with anyone. It was the worst movie ever made.",2,8,13,26 November 2011
