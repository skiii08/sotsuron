Ford v Ferrari," I know nothing of cars or racing, nor do I care about either yet....
","To start off, I have always hated racing. Yes, hated. It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing.. A very whole package overall.To finish off; I am STILL not interested in cars or racing, but this film stands on its own even so.",8,62,72,12 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Better than TLJ in my opinion
","Look, I didn't *hate* TLJ, but it was definitely a bit of a mess, and ruined a lot of the story progression in ways that I wasn't sure the trilogy could recover from. To my surprise, Rise of Skywalker managed to fix it but it suffered heavy losses in the process; the film feels a little bit all over the place, with scenes being cut short and the plot progressing at a ridiculously fast pace throughout. There are important chunks missing largely due to the loss of Carrie Fisher whose scenes were mostly unrelated snippets worked into the story (and very well done I must say, there just weren't enough of them). If this film had been two films, I think the issues with pace would have been fixed.TLDR: it's good, and what's not good I blame on TLJ. I will go see it again, as even with the flaws I did enjoy it. The best out of this trilogy is still Force Awakens.",8,1,3,21 December 2019
