The Double Life of Véronique," Spiritual Bonds and Pure Emotions
","Krzysztof Kieslowski's Polish films weren't exactly social descriptions but the Polish reality exhaled from them. After he had made The Decalogue and The Short Films About Killing and Love, he made his first international film La Double vie de Veronique which was followed by The Three Colours film trilogy. Already in No End (1985) Kieslowski worked with the screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz and the composer Zbigniew Preisner, with whom he made all of his subsequent films. In result of this masterful trio all the international films by Kieslowski are characterized by aesthetic styling. Compared to his Polish features they were also more ethereal, absurd and almost fantasy-like. In them, women rose out from the kitchen to Kieslowski's protagonists, and therefore he reached completely new emotional scales. The Double Life of Veronique tells the story of two young women, Polish Weronika and French Veronique who unconsciously share a spiritual bond.Weronika is a very talented singer, but she has a weak heart. She has to choose between artistic and normal life, because singing might have tragical consequences for her heart. When she wins a singing contest and the judges give her a chance to perform, she gets a heart attack in the middle of the concert and dies. The French Veronique is the double of Weronika and she also has a breathtakingly beautiful voice and a weak heart. Without knowing it Veronique shares a spiritual bond with Weronika, when Weronika dies she suddenly starts to feel vacant and blue. To avoid the pain she decides to give up art and starts to teach music in a school. One day a man, Alexandre who writes books for children and makes puppet show performances, arrives to the school. Veronique is immediately enchanted by him. A few days after Veronique starts to receive mysterious clues from Alexandre, an empty cigar box, shoe lace and a tape. The tape leads her to a railway station where Alexandre is waiting for her. They go to a hotel room and have sex, after that Alexandre finds a picture that Veronique has taken in Poland and sees Weronika in it. He of course thinks that it's just Veronique in the picture, but when Veronique herself sees the picture she begins to being aware of her double. Alexandre, who badly wants to be a real author wants selfishly to steal the double life of Veronique for his book. In result of this Veronique leaves, knowing that Alexandre is not the man she is looking for.In his interview book, Kieslowski on Kieslowski, he tells that he is always searching for the balance between understanding and mystery. Because if he shows too much the mystery disappears, and if he doesn't show enough -- no one understands a thing. But this is exactly the beauty in Kieslowski's films and in order to attain the new emotional scales of his international production, he had to preserve the mystery. In the end where Veronique realizes Alexandre isn't the right man for her, she leaves from there to her father's house. Kieslowski said that almost no one in the United States understood the ending -- by his producer's request he made an alternate ending for the States. They didn't understand where Veronique went, or if they did, they didn't know why. Kieslowski explained it through examples in his interview book that it is hard for Americans to realize the meaning of home. In European culture the family structure is much more stronger. Veronique touches the old tree seeking for comfort, care and safety.Just as Kieslowski's Blue, The Double Life of Veronique is also about music. Blue is about composing and Veronique is about singing. Zbigniew Preisner's masterful score is so beautiful that the audience could burst out into tears just in result of that. But, in addition, Idziak offers us some breathtakingly beautiful images with the help of the touching story by Piesiewicz, told us by the master of visual narrative, Krzysztof Kieslowski. The Double Life of Veronique deals with sensitivity, sensations and relations. It is a film about emotions. Loneliness, love and passion. It is about the relation between the spirit and the body. It's about eroticism, art, life and death.Many film fanatics see Jean Vigo's L'Atalante (1934) as the most beautiful film ever made and I couldn't agree more, but if talking about the new cinema (post-1970's) I can say without a doubt that The Double Life of Veronique is the most beautiful film. But what makes it so beautiful? Of course the cooperation of Kieslowski, Pisiewicz, Idziak and Preisner, but also the multidimensionality of it. The harsh Polish reality can be seen beneath the surface and, the story Kieslowski creates with Piesiewicz is breathtaking. It is so real and close to ourselves. The Double Life of Veronique is about our deepest emotions: it overflows with Pure Emotions.",10,0,2,14 August 2010
Casablanca," A Mythical Classic Defined by History and Time
","It's quite a burden for a man to start writing a review for 'Casablanca' (1942), the film loved and seen by everyone, and of which everything seems to be said a thousand times. The over-used statement 'we must fight for this film so that the future generations can enjoy it' just doesn't work for 'Casablanca' since no fighting is necessary. It doesn't need our help. Generations after generations have embraced the film and begun a beautiful friendship with it. This process has become a fundamental element in our culture which remains as time goes by.A memorable line after another, stylistic noir-aesthetics and a bunch of amazing performances make 'Casablanca' a true cult-classic in the word's most actual meaning. Everything is just right. Even the most die-hard supporter of the auteur theory must humble before this film and admit that it is a great piece of work without a distinct author. It is a sleeper whose success and popularity can only be explained by the equal input of the director, the many writers, the actors and the audience which cherishes it so. One uniting element, a force which glues everything together can, however, be found, and that is time. 'Casablanca' is so luminously a child of its own time that to neglect this aspect seems blasphemous. A big part of its timeless charm is its original fashion to deal with a historical moment, the relationship between individuals and even the mental events of a person at the same time and in the same equal eye. Thus 'Casablanca' moves fluently from the general to the particular and back. Best known example is of course the beginning: the camera drills down into the globe, to Europe, to Casablanca, to Rick's Cafe Americain and finally to the privacy of Rick's mind. A conflict of reality and consciousness at the stage of the world, the café. As said innumerable times, the café is the microcosm of the world, of Europe at war. 'Casablanca' was something that could only happen at one brief moment in the history of mankind. It is a work that was born from many factors which are forever admired such as Ingrid Bergman's natural beauty, Humphrey Bogart's powerful presence, his unique way of saying 'here's looking at you, kid,' and an inimitable mood of solidarity. All this among many other things is veritably moving. The magical atmosphere and the mythical birth of 'Casablanca' seem to capture the essence of an era, of a history. While it was being made there was no knowing who was going to win the war or how it all was going to end, but at least the many creators of this film had actual faith in a better tomorrow. So what else can be said? Something coherent, something persuasive, something original? Nothing, I guess. All words seem to make 'Casablanca' sound like a banal work of sentimentality which it only transcends. Watch it -- over and over again, and again and again. And once more.",10,2,3,25 January 2014
Citizen Kane," Why Is 'Citizen Kane' the Best Film of All Times?
","Anyone who sees 'Citizen Kane' (1941) for the first time today does so because he or she has heard that it is the greatest film ever made. One simply doesn't come across the film by accident on TV, watching it 'for what it is,' so to speak. The common approach of seeing it to believe it can be at best exhilarating and at worst hostile. Unfortunately, the latter is usually, although quite understandably, the case. For how can one do anything but look down at a film that elitist snobs have praised for years and years? One simply must prove oneself right by falsifying the critics' claims, leaving the theater or the living room with a shrug and a condescending comment: 'it was okay.' This will not do. It is a great tragedy if 'Citizen Kane' suffers from these kinds of incidents since it ought to be treated with the same kind of respect as Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' or Beethoven's '9th Symphony'. In order to make this happen, or perhaps enhance someone's viewing experience, I would like to try and explain not why 'Citizen Kane' necessarily is the best film, but rather why people have considered it to be. There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site, and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them, but hey what can I lose, and who doesn't love talking about Welles and 'Citizen Kane'?One might begin with the basic fact that 'Citizen Kane' wasn't immediately praised and considered the best film that has blessed the silver screen. It was a financial risk for the RKO studios to give free hands to the novice prodigy Orson Welles, who had gained quite a reputation with the radio show of H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds', and not surprisingly it didn't pay off. Despite the praises of a few critics, 'Citizen Kane' was soon forgotten, and the film wasn't, for example, screened at American cinemas during the late 1940's and early 50's. In France, however, the film was just discovered after the war, and the leading critic of the country, André Bazin hailed it as a masterpiece of the postwar stylistic tendency he characterized as spatial realism. Bazin's disciples, who we all know now as the nouvelle vague directors, followed and adored Welles' masterpiece. François Truffaut proclaimed that 'everything that matters in cinema after 1940 has been influenced by 'Citizen Kane'.' Thus the film's reputation grew and its new found reputation slowly found the other side of the Atlantic as well. But why did this happen? Why wasn't 'Citizen Kane' forgotten, and why, for one, did it arouse the interest of Bazin?First, it ought to be highlighted that the story of 'Citizen Kane' is excellent. Loosely based on the life and times of media mogul William Hearst, 'Citizen Kane' tells the story about a lonely giant who conquered the American media. It's a story about a man who dedicated his life to possession, but tragically became to be possessed by it himself. As one might have noticed, I am using the past tense, and such is the nature of Welles' narrative in 'Citizen Kane'. The film begins with the protagonist's death, and then portrays the attempts of a journalist trying to figure out the meaning of his last words -- 'Rosebud' -- by interviewing people who knew the man. 'It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing,' he supposes. This kind of structure was not considered the done thing back in the day. Although the basic structure of finding out a person's past goes back to Sophocles' 'Oedipus Rex' as well as numerous detective stories, the uniqueness of 'Citizen Kane' lies in the use of different perspectives, creating a non-linear narrative that has echoes from ancient drama and epistolary novels. Yet it wasn't really the intricate story that most fascinated Bazin. What Bazin emphasized was the film's style. Although all scholars have given up on the phoenix myth of 'Citizen Kane' and its innovative use of various cinematic means, it is simply a fact that the film made the style public, thus standardizing it for Hollywood. The aesthetic features of the so-called spatial realism, which Bazin adored, supported by the technological innovation of the BNC camera, include deep-focus cinematography, sequence shots, and deep-space composition. These had been used before, but hardly with similar, dare I say, philosophic unity. This stylistic tendency is enhanced by Welles' relentless use of heavy low-angle shots and dynamic montage sequences. There are innovative cuts that spark imagination and soundtrack solutions that open the story and its characters to new dimensions. 'Citizen Kane' is often celebrated as a bravura of the art of mise-en-scène since it puts a lot of emphasis on pre-filmic elements such as setting and lighting, but the real gist of the film's brilliance lies in the unity of these together with cinematographic and post-filmic elements.More remains to be said, but space is running out. The end of the matter is, I guess, that none of the individual elements of 'Citizen Kane' are, precisely, individual. They have not been distinguished from one another, but rather resonate luminously together in a unique fashion. Technological innovation goes hand in hand with aesthetic inspiration and both support the whole of story, theme, and style. Such unity may not have been present in Hollywood before 1941. From the groundbreaking use of the BNC camera to themes of power, loneliness, and defeat, which are reflected on the level of style, using setting and editing, for one, to reflect the emotional distances between the characters or their existential experience of emptiness, 'Citizen Kane' remains a gem to any lover of cinema. It's up there with immortal works of art from poetry, music, and painting. It is, like all great art, a tightly and beautifully sealed original whole which is why (instead of one big nameable innovation) the film has been considered to be of such magnificent proportions.",10,48,71,31 October 2015
The Caine Mutiny," A romantic navy-war film or a suspenseful courtroom drama?
","Probably both. The first half of The Caine Mutiny seemed like a simple navy-war film, slow-paced and it followed a basic dramaturgical model. After the first half the film started to look more like a courtroom drama, quite a good one actually. The dialog in the court was very well written, I can only recall one better courtroom drama from that era, To Kill A Mockingbird (1964).A young officer, Keith (Robert Francis) joins a crew of an old ship, Caine. Everything seems to be going well until the Caine gets a new captain, Philis Francis Queeq (Humphrey Bogart). Queeq is acting strange in the eyes of the crew and they start to think that he might be paranoid. When Queeq starts to lose his nerve the crew rises in revolt.The point where the naval captain starts to show signs of mental illness is the first turning point of the story. Unfortunately it is the moment when the movie actually starts going on. On the first half it wasn't getting anywhere. Of course slow-paced narration was usual in the 50's, but this isn't just that. I would have put a few more twists in the beginning to keep the audience interested. Even that I found the film successful, I wouldn't be surprised if the people of today found it dull.Humphrey Bogart always played cynical, but sympathetic roles. He always achieved to get the sympathy of the audience. Best examples of those roles are probably, Philip Marlowe from The Big Sleep (1946) and Rick from Casablanca (1942). So if you've seen either one of those, get ready for a different kind of role. The Caine Mutiny was the second last film Humphrey Bogart made and I can use the word 'make', because he always was the carrying force of a film. It's kind of sad to see him in his last roles, but also interesting.There has never been a strike on a U.S naval ship, so why would they make a movie about it? You shouldn't forget the fact that the States just got out of the Korean war (1950-53). It's not a description of the U.S navy, but it is a very realistic survey of human mind. How does it work in a crisis. That is actually announced in the beginning of the film.This was a good movie, I didn't find the beginning boring or anything like that, but it just seemed a bit dull after the second half. So I will probably remember The Caine Mutiny for Humphrey Bogart's unusual role and for its impressive courtroom scenes.",7,0,2,19 April 2010
Get Out," Jordan Peele's Directorial Debut 'Get Out' Is an Unprecedented Shock
","Many a cinephile might have lost all interest and hope in contemporary American films in recent years, but it turns out they might have just been looking at the wrong places. As the award-winning films of the country have become duller and duller, packed in a stale, tight corset, the most interesting auteurs have found their way in popular genre films which do not resonate that well with the businessmen who give out awards but which strike a deep chord with the general public. Long- time comedian, Jordan Peele's directorial debut 'Get Out' (2017) is a perfect example, and it has already garnered well-deserved critical praise in France. Alongside the Safdies' 'Good Time' (2017), another genre film which might go over the heads of the critics and award-givers who are used to the stale flow, 'Get Out' is definitely among the best American films of the year. It should be seen by everyone not only for its social significance but also for its cinematic freshness. An African-American photographer, Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) travels to his white girlfriend Rose's (played by Allison Williams) parents to visit them for the first time at their secluded estate somewhere in up-north countryside. The friendly atmosphere of this mundane meeting starts to crack and reveal something more sinister beneath the surface. The basic set-up of the plot echoes the classic civil rights era film, Stanley Kramer's 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' (1967) where a white woman introduces her African-American boyfriend to her liberal parents whose tolerance begins to show its limitations. Peele cleverly uses this inter-text as a backdrop, giving an undertone for the main theme, but essentially develops his film into something utterly original. Many spectators will leave the film with the thought that they have never seen anything like this. Never have the monsters of horror films felt so abstract and so concrete at the same time. Peele is able to derive from his comedy-background the ability to build up tension in a fashion which often borders the line of humor without directing the spectator to laughs but rather to flinches in terror. Although 'Get Out' does not come across as a self-aware meta-film dealing with the genre of horror like 'It Follows' (2014), Peele's film does have a self-awareness to it which, however, never interrupts a scene or the development of suspense. Peele might use genre conventions with an ironic twinkle in his eye, but they are never subjected to any comprehensively genre-critical discourse. On the contrary, the self-aware genre conventions enhance the deeply felt structure of the film whose narrative power pushes the spectators tightly into their seats. 'Get Out' begins with a serene shot of a wealthy American suburb where an African-American man is ambling, looking for the right street. This image in itself, mundane as its setting may be, already invokes feelings of horror because we have heard of so many stories where black men end up dead in innocent places such as these. It sets up an impressive and frightening sensation of not being welcomed which characterizes the film throughout. Peele's structured and disciplined mise-en-scène of precise compositions beautifully articulates and exemplifies the impression of a seemingly 'post-racial' society where everything seems to be in order, but which conceals secrets underneath.Overall, Peele's 'Get Out' is a real cinematic treat and most likely will acquire a following. Whether the film skyrockets Peele to cinematic success or not will remain to be seen, for it is always the second film which shows if the director's first hit was just a stroke of luck. Yours truly is very confident -- as well as interested and hopeful for the future of contemporary American cinema.",7,12,22,3 December 2017
La Grande Illusion," A Tender Classic about (the) War
","Jean Renoir's 'The Great Illusion' (1937) is often celebrated as the greatest anti-war film. It takes place during the First World War and was made just before the Second. Back in the day, Franklin Roosevelt stated that everyone who believes in democracy should see the film. Detaching from such political idealism, one might claim that every human being should see it. It's the film in which Renoir's humanism crystallizes, showing that humanity can preserve even in the darkest of nights. A story about POW camps and people escaping them is a tale of eternal love, friendship and yearning for freedom. A proof of its cinematic power is that without showing a scene of actual combat, 'The Great Illusion' is the most accurate portrayal of WWI. It seems that every film about the First World War much deal with its mythological position as the death of cultural innocence. Although 'The Great Illusion' begins with the war already going on, its opening scene works as a metaphor for the period before the war. We see a man singing in a café when all of a sudden he is called for a mission to transport a general which sounds easy and quick, but then turns into a long and unpredictable chain of events -- talk about dancing off to war. Not only does Renoir reach the fact that WWI was pointless and a consequence of ostentatious nationalism -- arms race, alliances and hostilities -- but also the feeling of transience as aristocracy begins taking its final breaths. In the hour of disappearance, two aristocrats, Bouldieu and Rauffenstein (aptly played by Erich von Stroheim), unite. The old general in 'The Rules of the Game' (1939) might say that they are a vanishing breed. It is beautiful and moving that Renoir's nostalgia considering this social transition has no irony whatsoever, despite Renoir's apparent sympathy for the working class. The nostalgia is very tender. All that matters to Renoir is humanity. It is precisely this human sympathy which is the strength of Renoir's cinema. This is present in Renoir's characterization, treatment of the class theme, and his anti-nationalist philosophy of the great illusion. André Bazin's timeless words are worth repeating at this point: 'the grand illusions are the illusion of hatred, which arbitrarily divides men who in reality are not separated by anything; the illusion of boundaries, (...) the illusion of races, of social classes (...). The war, the product of hatred and division, paradoxically reveals the falseness of all the barriers of prejudice separating man from man.'One of the many reasons for the survival of 'The Great Illusion' in the test of time is its realism (that is not afraid of poetry) which travels from the director's style to his world view and attitude towards life in general. Bazin thought that the film was based on the authenticity of human relations. I believe this is a key into understanding the film and its legacy. War is the great illusion because it separates us from one another. Yet, despite darkness and disappointment, Renoir continues to believe in love and humanity.",10,1,2,31 October 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," Symphony of Evolution
","Today I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey for the second time and therefore decided to write a little essay-like review. There seems to be three kinds of people with regards to 2001; people who bash the film for being boring and slow-paced, people who praise it as a masterpiece and the greatest science-fiction ever made and people who are somewhere in between. It's a film about futurology, evolution and the cycle of life. It deals with the progression of man when he faces the unknown and creates new devices to research it. Kubrick had collected an enormous amount of knowledge of past and presence to create the perfect illusion of future.2001: A Space Odyssey is built on traditional conventions and dramaturgical structure. It's divided into three acts, as most films are, and it follows an usual pattern. But in the name of thematics Kubrick had abandoned the conventional plot. But the film is not an eternal riddle that can't be solved. The biggest reason why the film comes across with such criticism is because people see it on lists of 'the best science fictions' and so on. People don't know what they are about to see and after being brainwashed by mindless modern Hollywood; don't understand a thing. There still are much more trickier philosophical science-fictions out there, for instance, Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpieces Solaris and Stalker -- which I warmly recommend. Especially Solaris has been compared with 2001 dozens of times. If western science-fiction, which Kubrick here represents, researches the physical boundaries of man and mankind; eastern sci-fi researches mental limits -- Tarkovsky studies a situation where man should act humanely under inhumane circumstances.The first act starts with a prologue sequence where prehistoric men, apes, live and try to survive -- the dawn of man. There's a huge leap of time taken from the first part to the second; from four million years ago earlier to the year of 2001. But then the leap from act two to act three isn't so far at all - 18 months. This seems to reinforce the idea that Kubrick wasn't interested in time, ironically in a film about progression, but in state, 'mise-en-scene' and space -- and, for Kubrick, film is much more of a visual form of art than a narrative.One statement of the film is that man is still the same which is told to us through the three part structure. In the beginning -- the dawn of man -- an ape found a bone of another animal and learned to use it as a weapon. Then we go through this brilliant shift to the year of 2001 where man has created technical devices with his superior brain that at the same enslave him, and this cycle culminates to the rebirth. This three part structure is experienced again, in the end, when the man travels forward in time. He sees images of him going through the cycle of life; he gets older, dies and is born again. The rebirth, the final image of the fetus, is powerful and spellbinding. It makes the cycle of life perfect. The baby is its own world, its own reality and it is ready to learn, progress and research -- looking down on Earth and us.2001: A Space Odyssey consists of nothing but images of the spaceship, with the exception of the first sequence. The cold, white steel walls, the blue shades and chambers of the spaceship represent inhumanity of man. One particular scene is a good example of this, science and technology turning man into an inhumane creature, where the man gets a birthday video message from his parents. He doesn't care to reply, just asks the computer system HAL to lift up his seat, and when HAL wishes him a happy birthday he instantly replies 'thank you.' Techonology has become man's best friend and all humane relations have disappeared - another clue can be found from the laconic conversations between the spacemen.It's also a film of contrasts; cold steel and the warm ground of the prologue, the humming sounds of the spaceship and the distressing silence of outer space, the blue shades and the blue color which is all around the ship; the only dose of red, love and warmth, seems to be coming from the computer system HAL. In the surrealist sequence also the complementary colors of blue and red meet each other; the mountains and the gorges. In the spaceship the crew eats food through a pipe but, in the end, in the Rococo room the man eats a normal meal -- on a plate. Man has went back to the old times: Rococo furniture, paintings and the food. But is still the same.The monolith has occurred a great deal of discussion and will do so in the future as well. It's clearly the motive of the film and collects symbolic meaning to itself as time goes by. First in the dawn of man it is an unknown object which the apes research with great fascination. In 2001 it once again appears just as unknown to the man as it did to their prehistoric grandfathers. They research it and discover that it is a new, and the first, artifact to be found by man from outer space. Towards the end, where the film starts turning into surrealism, the monolith floats in space -- far away from the hands of man. For once more it appears in the Rococo room where the man sees images of his life. It's in front of the man's bed as he tries to reach it, but can't. The monolith; the unknown is so far away and unreachable.",10,1,5,4 February 2011
Three Colors: Blue," Freedom is an Illusion
","Krzysztof Kieslowski's most famous films are his last. The three colors trilogy or film tricolor was very highly appreciated among critics and viewers. The series of three includes the films Blue, White and Red. After the last one, Red, Kieslowski announced that it was the best he could do and therefore retired. I don't believe, and I don't think even Kieslowski believed that Red was the best he could do. I bet he only wanted to get peace, by announcing that. To get out of the fame and media. Each of the colors have one main theme, but the same themes repeat in all films, for instance the paradox of freedom and love, which had been a leading theme throughout Kieslowski's work, culminates in The Three Colors. Blue - Freedom is about a woman who loses her husband and daughter. She is in a prison of love, she tries to move on, detach and become independent, but can't. The paradox of love and freedom: the woman wants to be free but can't because she is in love. 'People who think they're free are the least free of all.' K. Kieslowski.A woman, Julie (Juliette Binoche) suddenly gets in a car accident with her husband and daughter. She tries to find solutions how to continue her life, and decides to escape their home. Since Julie's husband was a famous composer, the media and the people are very interested in her life. Julie's husband had started a new composition in celebration of the united Europe. But because of his sudden death, the composition remained unfinished. A friend of Julie and his husband decodes to try to get the composition ready. When he gets Julie to agree and help him, they begin to compose it as close to the original purpose as possible.Why The Three Colours Trilogy is so famous and appreciated is because the films are so multidimensional and full of many layers. Each of them have their own story and themes, but certain events, motives and themes combine them. Blue is about a woman, White as about a man and Red is about a man and a woman. That is the simplest way to look at them. But each of them have their leading themes: Blue / Freedom, White / Equality and Red / Fraternity. But of course all the films deal with plenty of other themes. In Blue among freedom Kieslowski deals with the difficulty of detachment and independence. It makes us wonder what is freedom? Can we ever actually get it? What is the freedom Julie seeks or receives from? This is of course what Krzysztof Kieslowski intended. He breaks many codes of narrative and traditional dramaturgy, but he certainly doesn't do that just to seem intelligent. He breaks the chronology and leaves many things opened, but if one pays attention one will figure them out.In addition to Blue's thematic beauty and depth it is technically perfect. Krzysztof Kieslowski's main composer, Zbigniew Preisner composed the music for Blue as he did for No End and all the subsequent films by Kieslowski. His score is always very beautiful, touching, emotional and important for the film, but in Blue it is especially important for the story. The film itself deals with music, because Julie's husband was a composer. Preisner, who hasn't ever studied music wrote a beautiful composition for the unification of Europe. In the end where we get to listen to the composition one could cry. Not only because of the sad story or the touching climaxes, but because of the true beauty in cinema. I burst out into tears, the music is so beautiful, so perfect and so profound. The lyrics are taken from The Love Chapter in the Bible. The song is such a beautiful piece which makes one understand the beauty of life but also remember the enormous pain belongs to it.There are several ways to interpret Blue, the events, the choices and the situations in it. The simplest way to understand Julie's choice would probably be to think that she had known that her husband had an affair for years. That is why the appearing of the mistress doesn't shock the audience as it doesn't Julie. But the theme score by Preisner, which plays every time someone talks about Julie's husband to her, gives many changes of different interpretations for the audience. For instance in the beginning a journalist asks Julie: 'Is it true that you composed all the compositions by your husband?' No matter is the statement true, still Blue gives the audience a lot to decide, observe and think on their own.Krzysztof Piesiewicz the screenwriter was the third important man in Kieslowski's team. Kieslowski says in his interview, Kieslowski on Kieslowski that Piesiewicz is not much of a writer, but an amazing speaker. They talk for hours and write the screenplays together. But Kieslowski admits that usually all the great ideas come from Piesiewicz. These three masterful men were able to create a perfect film cycle. Krzysztof Kieslowski was very talented in visual narrative he didn't need dialog to explain certain things and emotions. For example the old lady recycling the bottle, Julie sees her but decides not to help her. In Red the main character sees her and does decide to help her. In Blue we are clearly told that Freedom is only an illusion, which people so hardly try to reach but never can get. If White portrays love as a prison then in Blue the paradox of love and freedom comes from the impossibility to set oneself free and become independent when still in love. Because to Kieslowski love is the strongest force of all just as it says in The Love Chapter. Only love can expose the true nature of freedom.",10,2,3,13 August 2010
Psycho," Mundane Freudian Horror from This World
","At the age of 60, Alfred Hitchcock decided to go wildly radical after his award-winning big productions. His next film, Psycho (1960), was an independent production whose budget was only 800 000 dollars. Through this Hitchcock was able to make a film, entirely in a way he wanted to but also achieve a naturally mundane atmosphere which was still characterized by psychological and film noir-like elements. Psycho is still Hitchcock's most shocking film and the most influential film he ever made. Just like The Beatles, the death of Elvis and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so is Psycho a part of the cultural legacy of the 1960's. It marked a turning point in the history of American cinema and changed its being forever: reality was now approached in a brand new way, through a Hitchcockian prism of fear. In the central of Psycho there is a run-down motel which has been left to the side of a new highway: a picture of alienation, a system which progresses quickly, neglecting the actual needs of people. The motel is run by an extraordinary man, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives alone with his mother. One day Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a woman who has just stolen 40, 000 dollars, arrives to the Bates' Motel. Having disappeared, Marion's boyfriend and sister start to look for her. But Norman isn't too happy about it and tries to avoid their investigation.Like in many films by Alfred Hitchcock, the opening credits of Psycho are extremely important and fascinating. These opening credits were designed by the storyboard artist and pictorial consultant Saul Bass, who had also designed them for The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). The credits, together with the score by Bernard Herrmann, manage to set out the theme and the topic of the film. The credits are often seen to illustrate the decomposition of the human mind but also the change of order and disorder which is common for capitalist urban life. It is an expression of the 'new' world order.The graphics designed by Bass don't just reign the opening credits: they're everywhere in the film. In the beginning, we see the horizontal Janet Leigh and her brassiere, and the vertical John Gavin, completely topless. The geometric polarity of horizontal and vertical lines repeats in concrete forms throughout Psycho: for example, the horizontal motel and the vertical Victorian mansion in which Norman's mother lives.Psycho is mundane, or as Michael Schmidt has said 'Psycho combines wonderfully the everyday and mysterious.' But it really isn't a b-movie. For Hitchcock the horror and excitement just happen to arise from ordinary, mundane things. Once again, the opening scene is a wonderful example of this: just a conventional, simple scene. Back then, the audience was affected by Janet Leigh's breasts and brassiere which were shown for the first time in the history of cinema but, what is more, the scene is so well filmed that the viewer can do nothing but get identified with the characters. Psycho indeed might just be the most polished thriller ever made. It's perfect, no matter how you look at it.Psycho puts the society to a collision between the shadows of past and presence. It conducted dialog between the old past and trendy presence. In the film, we meet two modern urban clichés: a regular office girl and a lonely youngster who also spends most of his time at his office. There is one intriguing scene which is a wonderful example of this: an unconventional love scene between two loners which, in turn, conducts dialog with the opening scene: now the characters don't talk about money and sex but about loneliness.The way I see it, if Psycho has got a thesis, it must be that fear is in ourselves. Marion is constantly put in scenes with mirrors: first in the office, then in the motel etc. The most luminous proof of the nature of this thesis is in the scene where Marion's sister (Vera Miles) scares her own reflection on a mirror -- a brilliant shot which soon became a cliché.In Psycho money isn't really essential. Money is present, all the time, but it doesn't make a difference -- it is insignificant. Hitchcock obviously wanted to show money just as a part of the society. It is a part of the air we breathe, so to speak. However, Psycho does also talk more widely about consumer society. A good example of the consumer culture is the scene where Marion quickly changes her old car to a new one. Even if her motive was to get away from the cops, the scene doesn't just talk about her personal hurry but about the social hurry inside us all. Psycho talks about the American society and about the transition, in the 1950's: how it turned from the conservative to more and more liberal in the 1960's but at the same became more alienated and anguished.I'm sure I could go on and on about Psycho but, unfortunately, there are limitations. To put it briefly, Psycho is one of the best American films ever made and its aesthetic, cultural and sociological influence is undeniable. Many have spent thousands of words just talking about the architecture of Psycho: how the mansion represents the Freudian psychic apparatus (id, ego and superego) and how much influence Hitchcock took from an American painter Edward Hopper (take a look at The House by the Railroad). Together with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960), Hitchcock's Psycho opened the gates for the graphically clear treatment for violence. However, it is much more of a film about our world than violence. Psycho is all about an example of voyeurism and alienation but, in reality, the criticism hits the whole perverted culture and society. Its mundane, Freudian horror is straight from this world and those who criticize it for being horrible, actually criticize their own existence and twisted world.",10,0,0,19 May 2010
Rear Window," A Macabre and Perverse Picture of Marriage
","'I always say that Shadow of a Doubt is my favorite but I am very proud of Rear Window.' (Alfred Hitchcock)In 1954 Alfred Hitchcock was at the top of his career. He had gained a reputation that can only be compared with a handful of others. He had the continuous need to regenerate, to find something fresh and new which can be seen everywhere in Rear Window; in its setting, movement of the camera, tricks and colors. It is an unusual film and doesn't have any flaws nor defects. Hitchcock had the challenge to make a film set in one room, and to show the story from only one perspective. Each shot was a risk taken, and as usually the risks taken by Hitchcock gave a lot in return. The film is a brilliant mixture of comedy, romance and excitement. It portrays the American idyll with its shadows. Rear Window is a perverse study of our society, and it's surprisingly dark, pessimistic if I may say. The impossibility of happiness, the agony caused by performance pressures and marriage, are the main themes of it. One critic even called it a horrible film because the hero spent all of his time peeping out of the window; to which Hitchcock replied: 'What's so horrible about that? Sure, he's a snooper, but aren't we all?'A photographer L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (James Stewart) has broke his leg and is condemned to the wheelchair. To spend his leisure time he spies his neighbors and, one day is convinced that one man has murdered his wife. The film is a criminal investigation done by Jeff apart from his moving disability. But we must not forget his girlfriend (Grace Kelly), who wants to get married with him and plays an essential part in this investigation with his feminine intuition.Rear Window is a clear film for its world view which is quite hard to see during the first viewing. Marriage is the main subject of the film, it is its leading theme and everything wraps around it; the nagging wife of the neighbor, Jeff's friend's wife, Jeff's nurse Stella and Jeff's possible wife-to-be Lisa Fremont. The quintessential realization of the film is that Jeff doesn't want to marry Lisa but just about everything around the yard reminds him of marriage: lonely woman without husband or lover, a couple who make love all day, bachelor composer who drinks, the little dancer whom all the men are after, childless couple who dote their life on the dog and of course the married couple who are always at each other's throats, until the wife mysteriously disappears. Then there's the wedding ring with a double-meaning which exposes the murderer; because if he hadn't murdered his wife and his wife would be out of town, she would've taken her wedding ring with her. As Lisa (Grace Kelly) goes to search the ring from the murderer's apartment, she finds it and puts the ring into her own finger and secretly waves back to Jeff. She got a double win: she got the evidence but, who knows, maybe this ring on her finger will inspire Jeff to ask her to marry him? What an ironic touch. Surrounded by marriage, Jeff obviously gets anguished. This agony caused by performance pressures and marriage, makes him a peeping tom: 'We've become a race of peeping toms,' as Stella puts it. This, of course, not only indicates to the character of James Stewart but also to all of us -- to our society. Alfred Hitchcock often let's or forces his viewers to be peeping toms in his films, Psycho for example, but in Rear Window this theme is at its most intelligent. This reinforces the idea that the film is a study of marriage and society, it portrays an anguished man for whom voyeurism is the only form of sexuality he is capable of. But also that the film is a study about the ethics of watching and peeping: the window-motive is the screen, it's a film about watching films. An important observation is also that Jeff only spies his neighbors at their most ridiculous, he doesn't like to watch their happiest moments. He gets entertainment, and pleasure, for watching them getting wet, talking to their imagery friends, nagging to their husbands and getting drunk. Rear Window is actually a cruel, and quite perverse, film. But it's brilliant, a masterpiece, who else had noticed this before Hitchcock. And it's not a thing to be ashamed of, it's just a humane part of us all. If the yard is the world, then Rear Window is also a film about isolation: the small apartments of the characters represent small private jails which they have built for themselves. The scene where the dog gets killed is an excellent example how people are unable to rely on each other let alone help their neighbors.Rear Window is a macabre picture of marriage. In the end the lonely composer and the woman find each other, perhaps start a life together, but nothing actually indicates that Jeff and Lisa would get married. Lisa is reading a traveling book 'Beyond the High Himalayas' to prove that she is ready to start an international life with a report-photographer. But as soon as Jeff averts his eyes she changes the book to a fashion magazine. What a cruel solution! French critic and filmmaker François Truffaut even said that the film's world view was close to misantrophy.Rear Window is a ruthless film about the agony caused by marriage, society and sexuality. It's easy to see as a cruel pessimistic film about the impossibility of happiness, but the overall mood of it is, paradoxically, warm, humane and compassionate. The yard is a picture of the world; full of people from all walks of life, small stories and all kinds of behavior. 'Rear Window is a symphony of everyday life and shattered dreams.' (François Truffaut)",10,1,3,28 February 2011
All the President's Men," Cigarettes, Typewriters, and Truths from the Shadows
","The 1970's, and especially the so-called Watergate scandal which led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon, marked a turning point in the not-so-distant American history. This turning point also cast its shadow on American popular cinema, and several political thrillers, drawing inspiration from Costa-Gavra's highly successful and influential 'Z' (1969), depicting the loss of credibility and trust for the state were made. Alan J. Pakula's 'All the President's Men' (1976) is the central film and how suiting it is since 'All the President's Men' retells the story which revealed the truth of the scandal that inspired this change; that is to say, the story of two reporters of the Washington Post, Bernstein and Woodward.Although the film might at first glance seem to be nothing but a visualization of a story that should have been expressed in writing, one slowly begins to realize that this appearance is really the strength of the film. In other words, Pakula's rigid and tight tension is due to his relentless dramaturgic desire to show only what matters story-wise -- and not just the story of the film, but the historical story that prevailed in the reality of 1976 America -- and nothing more. This stripping of everything superfluous creates a unique atmosphere whose grip is quite difficult to escape once one has started the film.If 'All the President's Men' as a historical (yes, historical) film tries to tell about a certain time in history, it also reveals something of its own time which is, of course, veritably close to the time its diegetic world takes place in. The spectator is given the chance to observe the work of investigating journalism before the revolution of the Internet when the three most important instruments of a reporter were telephones, typewriters, and cigarettes. One call after another, tapping words on a typewriter all night, and burning cigarettes like crazy characterize their everyday lives. Information must be discovered from libraries, archives, and unorthodox sources instead of typing a search term for Google. These words aren't meant for self-deliberate nostalgia, but rather to capture what takes place in front of our eyes when we sit around 'All the President's Men'; to feel its feel, to sense its sense, so to speak.More importantly than revealing the reality of 70's journalism, the film, of course, reveals the reality of 70's politics. Not only does the film do this, however, but also encapsulate a world whose sounds, smells, and sights we can now inhale after many a decade. 'All the President's Men' tells about a world of paranoia and fear, tormented by the uneasy threat of the Cold War. It's a world where the media creates lies and conceals, but where it can also be used to reveal that deception. It's a world where one must creep into the darkness of a night-time parking lot to hear the truths beneath the surface, the truths from the shadows which are intimidating and exhilarating, stirring yet liberating.So, at its heart, 'All the President's Men' is mainly interesting as a period picture, yet not only in the sense of showing what life was like in back then but also capturing its zeitgeist. Nonetheless, each time I see the film I am certain of the fact that its strength -- the total focus on the story -- is also its weakness since it can never rise above it and become something glorious, life-altering, and shattering. But the more important thing is that it doesn't want to. It is fine with what it is and as it is, a revelation or (if one is feeling less generous) a capture of a revelation. What is certain is that it is important and as such it shall remain.",7,1,1,16 February 2015
