Saturday Night Fever," Dated cult favorite - the musical moments are the highlights
","The many cons of this movies are definitely within the characters. Tony Manero is a brilliant dancer and a player with the ladies ('Well you can tell by the way I walk, you know I'm a woman's man') but that's basically all he knows.In the film, Tony struggles with two different lifestyles: one is staying in Brooklyn, with his jerk friends, bad job, dysfunctional family and fights with ethnic minorities. The other is with the more cultured Stephanie, actually going somewhere and getting a life. Tony constantly changes and re-changes his attitude towards these two lives, liking Stephanie and then snaps at her more cultured lifestyle, hanging out with his friends and then disowning them, claiming they're fake. Over and over again.As for the women portrayed in this film, they seem just as confused as Tony. What kind of a woman would go back to and forgive a man who had raped or who had almost raped her? A lot of the stories just don't make sense.The highlights of course, are the famous dance scenes and the Bee Gees music. At the time, this movie put the dance floor scene in the light, creating a cult status. My parents really liked this movie, only because of the music, only for me its not so much of a movie masterpiece as a lot of people say.",5,3,8,14 June 2011
Black Swan," Scary, heart-pumping and beautiful
","There's no doubt, people who like horror movies will have a great taste for this one. The psychological side of this film is the horror side of things, even though ballet perfection drives the motive of the story. Nina is a workaholic, constantly rehearsing her ballet moves to be the best. But her perfection tactics go out of control and become more and more damaging to her soul and mind. This is due to several people in her life: Her slightly overbearing and overprotective former ballet dancer mother, who, like her, is also over dramatic. Her ruthless and even more overbearing ballet professor, Thomas who uses sex as a way of getting his dancers to perform at top perfection, therefore creating emotional problems for them. And finally her rival and friend, Lily, whom she believes is out to get her part. Nina is utterly paranoid about Lily, but also remembers from Thomas to use sex as a way of staying in control of her perfect body and mind skills.You don't often get psychological thrillers (or horrors) that are as good as this one. The interaction between Nina and Lily (played to stunning perfection by Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis) is so believable and powerful, as well as Nina's seemingly out of control behavior, you actually believe some of the things you see are really happening. Frightening and stressful it may be on the entertainment side, but it's a damn good piece of filmmaking that deserves some Oscars.",10,2,6,24 December 2010
A Star Is Born," Romance done right
","I'm honestly very sceptical and cynical about romance films, as most of the time, they're cheesy, predictable and mawkish. And I really think this would have gone the same way had it not been for the amazing chemistry between Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. You totally believe in their characters and the story is a heartbreaking, yet heartwarming serenade. I do believe the earlier scenes with Jackson discovering Ally and the way her success and their romance blooms are the strongest. Gaga was utterly phenomenal and she really stole the show for me. Cooper on the other hand has that thing that all directors who get in front of the camera have: an imbalance of talent. While he does a great job at directing the film, he's not as fully focused on screen. Not to say that his performance wasn't great, but I have yet to see an actor getting behind the camera and at the same time deliver a performance of a lifetime. Doing two things at once is a difficult task all around. 9 out of 10",9,2,6,7 October 2018
Captain Marvel," 90s nostalgia meets alien race war
","Captain Marvel was not what I expected and ended up impressing me more than I thought.The beginning of the movie starts off like your run of the mill Star Trek film - with Verse AKA Carol Danvers, a Kree warrior, fighting the rival alien shape-shifting Skrulls. She gets captured and, during her escape, accidentally crash lands on earth.And it's here that the film really kicks off. It is the mid-1990s with retro technology, VHS stores and grunge clothing. Carol soon meets a younger, two eyed Nick Fury, and together they try to piece together what the Skrulls want, eventually leading her finding out that she once had a life on earth and not in space as she once believed.The film has a distinct 90s feel, an amazing kick-ass herioine, an incredibly touching tribute to Stan Lee, timely messages about female empowerment and refugees, and a fantastic soundtrack to beat.Just like Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch with their own Marvel counterparts, Brie Larson was best person to play this part - delivering just the right vulnerability, emotion and bad-assery to the role.10 out of 10",10,26,62,7 March 2019
Passengers," Okay-ish, but certainly not as bad as the critics made it.
","A lot of critics and audiences really did not care for this movie. To be honest, the film was highly watchable. Fantastic score, great acting and beautiful cinematography. The story in itself aspires to be something bigger than it actually is. Chris Pratt's character is woken up ninty years too early on a ship who's destination to another planet takes 100 years. To his horror, he finds out he is the only other person on the spaceship who is awake. He becomes so lonely after spending a year with no one else but a robot for company, that he decides, very reluctantly, to wake up Jennifer Lawrence's character, for good company. What he does is really quite horrible, but to be honest, can you blame him after spending so much time alone? Everyone complained that the film pussy-foots around this issue, but I thought it really does illustrate how bad Jim's actions were towards Aurora.Everything in this film is certainly on the surface, but it's a very cute surface. It reminded me of WALL-E a bit, not least because of beautiful score by Thomas Newman.6 out 10",6,0,2,3 May 2017
The Hunger Games," It dragged on a bit, but it was a nice effort
","The first half of the film could very well have been rated PG, or even G. Then when the Hunger Games actually start, it may as well be a different film, an R rated one. It's total suspense and heart pumping at times, which is good. The shaky camera didn't bother me, as it started only when the kids were fighting and running, keeping with the tone of urgency and desperation. Jennifer Laurence is absolutely brilliant as Katniss Everdeen - which the character has many similarities to that of the Oscar nominated role of Ree in Winter's Bone (taking care of her siblings while her mother is catatonic, facing dangerous situations, never giving up and doing it on her own), and really captures the emotional turmoil her character faces.Now on the other hand, what really bugged me was that the film was too long and really dragged on towards the end, making the ending less than enthusiastic and sort of ruined the prospect of it being a 'game changer' . Also, the film has a very interesting message and theme: Combining war with reality TV. The way the kids are exploited like they are not human beings is really horrifying, but the film focuses more on the action rather than the message and the reasons for these terrible Hunger Games. The book was brilliant, but the film really could have been much better. 6 out of 10",6,1,6,7 April 2012
Thor: Ragnarok," Definitely the funniest Marvel movie yet
","With the third Thor movie called 'Ragnarok' which means the apocalypse, you would think it would be the darkest entry in the saga yet. Not so!By bringing in Taika Waititi, a New Zealand director who brings in his special vision and kiwi humour into the mix, this an amazing, kaleidoscopic, gut-bustlingly hilarious ride. Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster is wonderfully funny, Tessa Thompson as Valkerie, a hard-drinking Asgardian warrior is a total breath of fresh air and Korg (played by the director) is just as eccentrically wicked as Rocket Racoon. The Age of Ultron got criticized by some for including a bar scene where the Avengers have fun with Thor's hammer. But to be honest, I'd always welcome the Avengers having a good old time, making jokes, bantering and insulting each other in the process.Doctor Strange makes an appearance, which is amazing. He takes his job as the Sanctorum's gate-keeper very seriously and has no time for Loki's mischief. A very welcome change indeed in these troubled times.",10,52,94,31 October 2017
Moana," A beautiful addition to the collection
","I'm so glad when Disney select a theme, culture or population and tell an interesting story with it. This film reminds me a lot of the old Disney movies (Mulan, Hercules) as well as the new ones (Frozen, Wreck it Ralph). It's got a spunky, feisty heroine, a funny lovable sidekick (Maui), breathtakingly beautiful animation, ear wormy songs (You're welcome!) and accurate depiction of different cultures.The only thing it lacked, however, was a good villain. Tamatoa, the giant Smaug-like crab who sings like a glam rock artist, hardly gets any screen time to 'shine'. Which is a shame, since he seemed like a pretty good character. Definitely a good movie to watch when you're depressed. ;)",9,3,15,13 December 2016
Suicide Squad," S.S - Skewered and scrambled
","After much anticipation, and after a long wait, it pains me to say that this movie is disappointing to say the least.From start to finish - the script is an absolute mess. Too many characters are introduced and subsequently under-used, and the soundtrack, which was actually the best part, was scattered all over the place, placing one greatest hit after the other in a very short space of time. Harley Quinn and Deadshot seemed to be the protagonists of the film (Smith and Robbie doing a great job of it) but even they didn't have enough character development. The Joker was hardly in it at all - and Harley Quinn's backstory was simply glossed over, when it could have been a hell of a lot more interesting. And half the scenes in the trailers don't even make it into the movie. A real shame.",4,4,9,11 August 2016
Lost in Translation," Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and Sofia Coppola - perfect combination
","Bill Murray's best performance, Scarlett Johansson's debut to fame and equally brilliant performance and Sofia Coppola's top notch and unique directing really make this movie worthwhile. I was mostly impressed with Sofia's directing, camera angles and truly breathtaking and brilliant screenplay. It's not very often you get shots as good as these in movies. This is a story about two people, an old, washed up actor Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and a twenty-five year old woman, Charlotte, (Scarlett Johansson) both in Tokyo in the same luxurious hotel. Bob is being payed 2 million dollars for a commercial and photo shoot to promote his whiskey, when he could be at home with his wife and kids doing a play, while Charlotte has been dragged along by her husband who is mostly away on business doing celebrity photographing. When they both meet, they click immediately. They both explore and try to fit in with the Japanese culture and mingle with friends of Charlotte's.With a huge gap of age difference and both of them married (though Bob is somewhat estranged from his wife and kids) they form a relationship that is much stronger than physical aspects. They share a mutual understanding of the confusion of both their private lives and the difficulty of trying to adapt themselves to a foreign place.A young woman trying to find her place in life and an older man past his prime, looking for something he used to have. Many people can relate to these characters, and that's what I love about movies. You feel the realness of their situations. This film is like American Beauty set in Japan. It lifts you high up from the ground and you'll want to remember the journey, and the message it sends.",9,2,4,24 March 2010
Doctor Strange," Never fear, the Doctor is here
","This film really is everything the critics have been saying. Stupendous, visually spellbinding, brilliantly acted and very funny. In the beginning, neurosurgeon Stephen is so arrogant that he becomes almost completely unlikable. After the intense car accident, he tries every possible means to heal his hands, to no avail, and he runs out of funds. When Christine (Rachel McAdams) tries to encourage him to try different things, he verbally abuses her in such a way that it reminded me of Christopher Moltisanti from the Sopranos. Unlike the meek and battered Adriana however, Christine has sense to leave him and cease contact with him.The transformation from this selfish asshole to a humble and caring Sorcerer Supreme is out of his world, literally. Stephen is plunged headfirst into a sea of different dimensions (it's a wild and trippy sight) learning different spells (no silly wordy spells like in Harry Potter) and finally overcoming his ego with the help of the Ancient One, in order to save the world from other worldly threats.Cumberbatch truly is Doctor Strange and he has the right mix of cockiness, humour, emotion and bad-assery embedded in the role. He surprised me at every turn.Although the villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelson) was cool, he was sort of weak compared to the others we've seen in Marvel blockbusters. Tilda Swinton is the second best performance in this film. She truly is magical, mysterious and sassy as The Ancient One. Wong is brilliantly funny as the super-serious librarian, Chiwitel Ejiofor's character arc as Baron Mordo is also just as interesting as Stephen's. I'll be very curious to see what he does in the next instalments. And that levitation cloak! I absolutely love it. It guides Stephen to defeat and protect him from villains, helps him fly, and even wipes away his tears at one point. It reminded me of BB8 from Star Wars in some ways.Definitely one of the best Marvel films I've seen in a long time. Although nothing beats all of the superheroes being in one movie, ready to fight off danger. I look forward to seeing The Doctor again, soon.",10,14,29,28 October 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," McDonagh's best film bar none.
","Frances McDormand plays a grieving mother who has had enough of the ineptitude of the local police in catching her daughter's rapists and murderers. She puts three billboards up near the town highlighting her feelings and the town's residences instantly takes a disliking to them. Things get steadily worse when it is revealed that Willoughby, the town's chief named in one of the billboards, has cancer. The movie has that amazing, rare ability to carefully balance humour and darkness at the same time. It weaves in various social issues through Mcdonagh's signature wit and political incorrectness. One minute I was tearing up at the sad predicament some of the characters were going through, the next, I was laughing my head off at their hilarious dialogue.It's a movie about female rage at the lack of interest in finding justice for sex crimes. Certainly as relevant today as ever.",9,3,8,8 January 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Proof that the critics are not always right.
","Bohemian Rhapsody is a near perfect biopic on one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time, focused on its legendary, charismatic, flamboyant lead singer Freddie Mercury. It begins and ends with the infamous Live Aide concert and follows the band's beginnings and troubles in between.Seeing how a famous song was created is always a treat in biopics, no matter what genre. It ticks all the boxes of what goes on on the road, at concerts and the creative differences between band members. Rami Malek absolutely embodies Freddie in this film and he's sure to be nominated for some awards!This was the long awaited biopic all the Queen fans have been waiting for. And although it's not the best musical biography film I've seen, it is certainly one of the most enjoyable.",9,4,6,7 November 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The adaptation the book deserved all along
","Let me start by saying David Fincher is one of the best directors in Hollywood today and his films are truly unique and artful. In this brilliant movie, his technique for cinematography and quality is top notch and apparent from several of his other movies dating back to 1995 (Se7en). Rooney Mara really is the real Lisbeth Salander from the books. Although Noomi's version was just as good - she didn't physically resemble the Lisbeth from the books. Mara's Lisbeth is hard, socially inadequate, vulnerable and child-like. In the books she is constantly portrayed as looking like a child or a teenage boy, and her physique and interpretation are spot on. Daniel Craig's Blomkvist is also a lot like in the books - slightly unemotional and dedicated in his left wing beliefs as a journalist in the Millennium magazine.As for the comparisons between the Swedish film version and the book itself - I thought there were both good and bad things. First I'll start with the bad things - the debate between Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist concerning whether Martin Vanger should be understood for his actions because of his terrible dysfunctional relationship with his father is omitted (in the Swedish film and the book, this is an important understanding of the difference between the two characters) - Lisbeth's line to Mikael after she saves him from Martin, asking permission to kill him (Lisbeth doesn't ask permission) - the absence of the scenes between Lisbeth and her mother - Lisbeth telling Mikael about burning her father alive (we don't find that out until the second installment of the series, least of all from Lisbeth's own mouth) and finally the circumstances involving the encounter of Miriam Wu by Lisbeth. Now the good things involve mostly around the fact that - apart from a few of the bad things I mentioned earlier, it's very faithful to the novel. The actors are perfect in their portrayals and the writing is terrific. There's a twist in the circumstances of the missing girl, which for me was refreshing since, after reading the book so many times, the events in the film were quite predictable. I'm also glad they changed the event of Lisbeth breaking her computer, instead of having the crap beaten out of her by random thugs for being female, like in the Swedish version (which didn't make any sense - plus there was enough violence done to her by Bjurman), she bashes a robber after he took her computer.Overall absolutely terrific movie that deserves a few Oscar nominations, especially for Best Picture and Best Actress. There are some extremely horrific rape and revenge and animal cruelty scenes which are hard to swallow but it was still generally good thriller entertainment. I congratulate everyone who worked on the movie and for being daring enough to make it so different from the rest of the Hollywood movies out there.",9,1,5,22 January 2012
Dunkirk," The definitive action movie
","What's remarkable about this film is its intensity - that ability to pull you in and really feel the tension and terror of the action these boys really faced.The film relies mostly on these aspects, but also the human interaction - and explores how war makes people paranoid and so full of fear that they are willing to attack their own allies.The score is remarkable. Hans Zimmer never fails to amaze me, and neither does Nolan's direction. I'm glad we have films like these that really show and make you feel the horror of the action people face rather than dumb robots destroying buildings and having no emotional connection to anyone involved.Make sure to see this in Imax!",9,2,10,23 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," A psychological super-hero movie
","Yet another masterpiece from the Marvel film franchise. Some people went in the theaters being on either Team Cap or Team Iron Man, but by the end of the film, it's clear no one was sure which side to be on.The film presents events, people and confrontations that justifies each and every Avenger's motivations for choosing a side. They are all valid and understandable. Tony Stark wants to make amends for the damage he and his fellow Avengers have caused other people, worried that he won't be able to stop. Which leads him to sign over his suit to the government to control when they decide. Steve Rodgers, on the other hand, is distrustful of the government, which can be manipulated and corrupted by criminals, like the Hydra, and maintains that 'the safest hands are still their own.' After a series of disasters involving Steve's friend Bucky, the two camps get into a confrontation at an airport. This is one of THE best fight sequences ever, as we get to see all of the Avengers (plus two new faces, Black Panther and Spiderman) use their various and unique skills against each other.The psychological aspects, betrayal, friendship and revenge and lessons on morality make this a unique film - and with each Avenger given enough screen time.This is a blockbuster you do not want to miss!",9,22,47,30 April 2016
Avengers: Endgame," An epic, beautiful and heart-wrenching finale to the whole franchise.
","The trailers to this film are completely misleading. It painted a bleak, inevitable outcome for the surviving heroes after Thanos's devastating snap that left the whole universe in ruins.It goes into a completely different direction than I originally expected. For one thing, it's much funnier than I thought.
It's also nothing like Infinity War. It's basically a mix of many other marvel movies all wrapped into one epic heist film.Its lengthy time run does get a bit problematic at times, but by the time the climactic battle sequence comes by the end, you forget all about it. Those who had been disappointed or despondent by Infinity War will rejoice when seeing this one.The film is a true testament to sacrifice, love and loss. Obviously I laughed, I cried and I clapped. This is truly cinematic history.",10,21,55,24 April 2019
Foxcatcher," Fell very flat
","I was expecting intensity, an interesting story and character study from this film, but I was disappointed. The film is intensely bleak, dealing with the sport of wrestling, with no laughs or empathetic moments. Channing Tatum wears the same bull-like expression throughout the whole film, not really evolving much as a character. I just found him whiny, cold and dumb. Mark Ruffalo (whom I really loved in the Avengers) despite being nominated for some prizes, unfortunately didn't stand alone for me in the movie.Steve Carell's John du Pont, in a surprising dramatic role, comes off as creepy from the moment you meet him. You know fully well that something is off with him (and of course since he murders one of his friends at the end of the film). But sadly, the film doesn't focus too closely on why du Pont murdered Dave, other than the awkward, dysfunctional relationship with his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and the Schultz brothers distancing themselves from him. For a film that's receiving a lot of awards and praise, this really doesn't cut it for me.",5,6,15,3 January 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," You didn't see THAT coming?
","I am a person who has never read the comics, but has fallen in love with the films. And it has to be said with this particular universe, all of the filmmakers have transformed what were either unlikable or one dimensional heroes and villains into fully fledged, lovable, three dimensional characters. They make you care for these people - which is why this film works extraordinarily well.This movie is many things: extremely relentless, fast-paced, funny, heartbreaking and action packed. And contains one of the most jaw-dropping endings I've ever seen. When a mass-market appeal blockbuster is totally invested in consequences, storylines and character arcs, as well as taking big risks, I absolutely love it and wish more movies had the balls to do it. That being said, there is a small part of me that wished I wasn't so geeked out and in love with the characters. But it's too late, as Doctor Strange says at one point, 'We are in the endgame, now.'The filmmakers did right, they didn't joke about and they meant it when people should not spoil the movie. Go and see it.",8,4,13,28 April 2018
Behind The Candelabra," Everything I like about a movie
","Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of Steven Soderbergh as I find a lot of his films quite boring. But this film really blew me away.It has everything I want to see in a movie: great performances, true stories, same sex love, a little bit of nudity, but not too much, truthfulness, warmth, minimum amount of violence and good cinematography. I have a newfound respect for Michael Douglas, who becomes completely unrecognizable (with a little help of good make up) , gives it all in his performance as Liberace, and yet only just beat cancer a year earlier.10 out of 10**",10,51,74,28 May 2013
Gone Girl," The book was better
","This is a really brilliant film, and was in good hands with David Fincher, but I couldn't help remembering how utterly fantastic, thrilling and scary the original book by Gillian Flynn was. How for the first time, I actually felt unsafe reading a book due to the massive twist in one of the first person narratives. One of the flaws in the film is that the character of Amy (played in an intensely creepy and brilliant manner by Rosamund Pike) was not given all the details of her past, her life and relationship with her parents, and more into her relationship with Nick, to fully explain why she did the things she did. Nick comes off quite quickly to the audience as being the unlikable bastard the public in the film believe. And also, the relationship with his dad is just hinted as being 'strained' in the film and doesn't explore why they don't like each other much.The ending, unfortunately, is pretty poor compared to the one in the book, using only ambiguity.Although the movie is well shot and acted, finally giving the typical Hollywood audience something new and engaging, it simply didn't carry enough of the urgency and depth that the novel had.",7,1,6,13 December 2014
Frozen," An act of true love
","Frozen is a new breed of Disney fairy tale 3D animated films, that tries to bring the old genre into modern day audiences, the first one being the hand drawn Princess and the Frog, followed by Tangled. Both Tangled and Frozen have classic princesses fitted into a modern animated film. However in the latter there are two; Anna is normal but her sister, Elsa, has the dangerous power of freezing whenever she gets emotional, therefore she is kept away purposely from her sister so as not to kill her. By making the antagonist the heroine's sister, it shows very accurately the complicated plot of two sisters struggling for their relationship to go smooth so that Elsa can stop the world from plunging into an eternal winter, created from her powers. The only problem is that Elsa was never loved as child due to her condition, and kept away from everyone for their safety. It would have been so damned easy to make Elsa the villain in this film, but she is not the villain. She's a human being who is cast aside because of her special powers, and she rejoices in using them to fulfil who she really is: an ice queen.The best moment comes near the end and it's an amazing twist that has never happened before in a Disney movie. You'll have to see it to understand it better, but it was definitely the favorite part of the film for me.One thing I didn't like is that there were too many short songs. When the characters are only just introduced, they immediately start singing, which makes it annoying. It would have been better if we got to know the characters a lot more before they began their song, like the big hit 'Let It Go' sequence with Elsa (Idina Menzel's voice makes it even better).For some reason, if the animated Disney film is not a musical featuring a princess, such as Wreck It Ralph, Treasure Planet or Atlantis, it doesn't fit in with the 'crowd', yet I loved all three of them. Frozen is definitely a superior film to Tangled and I hope that the studios will make even better films.",8,0,2,15 December 2013
2012," Typical Hollywood cliché
","The plot is that the Mayans predicted that in 2012, the world would end. So the protagonist and his family, like in almost every other disaster movie, survives, unlike thousands of others, by driving through an earthquake, a seemingly and visually impossible thing to do, has an amateur pilot able to fly them all out in a small plane with a huge explosion right behind them and the dad (played by John Cusack) who is late for the ride, manages to get in the plane just in time. Surely by now, all of them should have been dead, but they're kept alive just so they can find out that Savior ships (trying to imitate Noah's Arc) have been built to keep the globe alive.Of course all the while there's this sentimental stuff between separated relationships getting back together as the world ends and all that, that you can find in pretty much any movie. But in this case, it just makes the film more pathetic. Indeed, the special effects are powerful, like being on a roller-coaster, but as far as writing goes, it falls straight in the category of déjà vu Hollywood.If you've never seen this kind of movie before, the world destroyed by some kind of apocalypse and the heroes running for their lives, go and see it, but I bet you any money you've seen it somewhere before.",5,2,4,8 January 2010
The Lion King," You can't remake The Lion King
","I wasn't too keen on an idea of a remake of the Lion King because, simply put, you can't improve on perfection.And despite the stunning visuals, beautiful songs and great actors, this one just felt pretty flat almost throughout.Problem number one - it's all been done before. It was nearly a shot for shot remake of the 1994 version.Problem number 2: Real lions cannot emote. Therefore in scenes where emotion is required of the characters - the lions presented on screen simply cannot deliver it. It's almost like those earlier movies where real life animals were used and only the mouths are animated.Problem number 3: Scar, despite being voiced by the brilliant Chiwitel Ejiofor, lost all of his humour and cunning wit. It was one of the main reasons Simba trusted him in the first place. He, as well as the audience found him amusing - which made his actions later in the movie so horribly devastating.So no, it did not blow me away.",5,4,5,19 August 2019
Hidden Figures," Inspiring, beautiful and hopeful
","The untold story about the three African American women who helped NASA fly the first astronauts into space is finally put on the big screen. It's movies like these that absolutely must be told, as there are loads who haven't been widely known yet. This film reminded me of one of my all time favorite films, The Imitation Game, another biopic about a math genius underdog who's extraordinary skills helped change the world for the better. I personally detest maths, but the heart of the story lies in the real life women who overcame both racial and gender barriers and use their skills to advance the achievements of NASA.The soundtrack is absolutely marvelous and should be nominated for many awards. The person who made the biggest impression on me was Taraji P. Henson as Katherine Johnson, the no- nonsense mathematician who worked closely with Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) head of NASA.This is an incredibly inspiring and uplifting film. Definitely not one to miss!",10,7,19,22 January 2017
1917," One of the most beautifully shot war movies ever.
","Putting the camera on your two protagonists for the entirety of the film is a risky move. So is telling a fictionalised story in a historical setting. But here, it absolutely pays off.I was knocked back several times by both the horror and the beauty I was witnessing on screen. Unlike many war movies, it's not preoccupied with white male rage, mad-cap shenanigans and the gratuitous brutality of war. It focusses only on the mission the heroes, their surroundings and the many, many terrible and moving events in both in and out of the trenches.The music, direction, production design and cinematography should all win awards for this.",10,14,22,24 January 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A usual good thriller but with a new incredible spice of a character
","Based on the novel of the same name by Steig Larsson, having a title such as Men Who Hate Women clearly states that the film is disturbing. There are two main characters. Mikael Bloomkvist, a disgraced and humiliated journalist who is called upon by an ostracized member of the Vagner family to investigate the disappearance and possible murder of his niece Harriet. The other main character is the one that really grabs our attention. Lisbeth Salander, a strange, tattooed and pierced 24 year old who professionalizes in computer hacking. Her attention is fixed on violence against women, in which her own presence is a repeated victim of. A group of male thugs beat her, her guardian (which I don't remember why she needs him, but it's explaind in the later episodes) viciously and repeatedly rapes and beats her, all with no general reason except that she is a woman, living in a sadist man's world.However, it becomes clear throughout the course of the film, that Lisbeth is a woman who does not take any crap from anyone. She scares the misogynist group of youths away with a broken bottle, screaming like a panther, leaving them shocked that she would defend herself and not succumb to their violence. She allows herself to get raped a second time only to video tape it, therefore using it against her rapist. She tortures him very brutally, sexually abusing him and tattooing him for what he really is, a sadist and a rapist pig. I found myself smiling when she did this.She and Mikael come together in the middle of the film and they work on the case, leading them to shocking discoveries of brutal and hateful grisly murders, the story getting more and more twisted just like a normal good thriller should. Lisbeth is really the true heroine of the stories; a weird, strong and fascinating creature, played brilliantly by Noomi Rapace. The film, long, graphic, gory and very hard to watch and follow, is a brilliant Swedish masterpiece.",8,5,8,16 November 2010
The Imitation Game," Outstanding
","This is by far my most anticipated movie ever. And it was well worth the wait. This film, about the accomplishments, trials and tribulations of gay mathematician and codebreaker Alan Turing, is utterly breathtaking and well crafted. Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Alan Turing is not just the performance of the year, it's one of the best performances of all time. He breathes life, passion and extreme emotion into this role, more so than any other of his other performances.I had read the biography of Alan Turing, by Andrew Hodges, a year before the film's release. although it is a very loose adaptation of the book, it is an entertaining version of the story. The book was intensely complex and lengthy, and, just as the opening lines of the movie state, you have to pay attention. Personally, I can't think a better film adaptation of the intricate, enigmatic and beautiful story of Alan Turing. Seeing what all these men and women did during the war, and all of the achievements Alan did, such as making the first designs for a digital computer (sadly this is only alluded to in the film) and shortening the war by two years, is just extraordinary. The film truly does justice to a man so horribly wronged by a homophobic system at the time. We can only hope that prejudice doesn't recede to its harsher ways so that lives such as these are ruined forever.",10,2,8,8 January 2015
La La Land," A leap into imagination
","What a sweet film! Like Birdman, this is a very unique picture that offers something revolutionary to the eyes and ears.It fits into the category of complete escapism, like in the Golden Age of cinema. If you are looking for a musical with political or social overtones, you may be disappointed. This is a very simple story about love and following your dreams in Hollywood. It manages to avoid a lot of the cheesy parts and is not your average musical you see on Broadway.The two leads are brilliant to watch and extremely likable. And the production design is breathtakingly beautiful. This movie will definitely win a lot of awards. ;)",9,4,12,30 January 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Tips the scales in both the right and the wrong
","To be honest, I never found the animated movie as spellbinding as everyone else. I never owned the VHS as a child. I really liked it and there were a lot of great things about it, but I preferred other films. This live action version manages to correct a few mistakes, but also leave out some things and add new ones that weren't necessary. The set is beautiful, and the song and dance routines are very energetic. The characters are rendered more realistic and three dimensional with extra back stories. What I thought was the best change was the character of LeFou. He is not really a villain in this film, more like a very sweet guy who happens to worship and be in love with a very bad man (Gaston).The same could not be said of the Beast. I kind of prefer it in the animated version. There were things left out and things added that were both good and bad, but ultimately didn't leave much of an impact as I thought.Another thing I thought was missing was the hilarious banter between Lumière and Cogsworth ('En Garde you overgrown pocket watch!'). Overall, it's a sweet and beautiful tribute and expansion to the cartoon version, but probably not enough to make it stand out on its own.",7,0,3,25 March 2017
12 Years a Slave," Painful, yet utterly rewarding...
","Steve McQueen's masterpiece 12 years a Slave is probably the most haunting, riveting, beautiful and unflinching depictions of human rights abuses of all time. This is not an easy watch at all, as it is not what a normal movie would do, which is to entertain. It left me with an impact that went beyond anything I'd seen in years. This is truly an accomplished work of art and an astonishing piece of storytelling.What is truly disturbing about this film is that the issue of slavery itself is not not just a thing of the 1800s; it still goes on today. Even as we speak, people are enslaved, beaten, raped, psychologically abused and forced to work under appalling conditions. As McQueen pointed out in his Bafta speech, there are 21 million people enslaved today, and that he wishes that no other director would, 150 years from now, have to make another film like this one. This film explores the core of human suffering, and the basic nature of humans who want to be free more than anything else. There is no worse sound than the silence of the holocaust that is slavery.10 out of 10, if I could give it more, I would.",10,1,3,20 February 2014
Sausage Party," Could have done with a few more cuts
","When I first saw the trailer, I thought 'Finally! They're bringing back adult animation to the mainstream! Just like Ralph Bakshi did in the 70s!'The scene that got everyone sold in the trailer, when the potato gets shaved and boiled and the baby carrots get eaten in the film, unfortunately, doesn't come until later. Before that, there's a whole lot of stuff that may put several people off.The film uses too many f bombs, explicit jabs at political satire and old jokes that will probably make you groan rather than laugh. Though this is a film clearly for adults, it feels juvenile. There were, however quite a few laugh out loud moments, but not many. The orgy scene at the end was hilarious, scathingly crude and insane. I've heard people complain about the racist and sexist jokes in the film, and yes, they are there, but the people who will be offended the most are the religious ones.It's anti-Pixar, anti religious, anti-PC, pro-stoner, pro-sex and more. But unfortunately it doesn't really carry out a powerful enough message as the Bakshi films, Meet The Feebles or South Park. For a project of this caliber, I think it could have left a few things out, and a bit more satirical depth.",7,3,7,21 October 2016
Joker," Not funny, not comfortable. But that's kind of the point.
","I can't really remember a film in more recent times that's generated this much controversy. But I can sort of see why.The Joker has always been an excellent villain because he is thoroughly unpredictable, smart and has a disturbing point to the things he does - despite them being utterly repugnant and horrific.The film has the feel, themes and pays tribute to both Taxi Driver and the King of comedy (both starring Robert DeNiro and which the latter plays a famous comic in this one) Arthur Fleck is a mentally ill loner who gets trodden in every step of the way. He is beaten by thugs in the street, fired from his job and has to take medication for condition that causes him to laugh inappropriately.One day he snaps, committing a murder which spurns a whole movement against the rich.The film had been accused of sympathizing with incel white loners who took out their frustration on women, gays and people of color. Which is hogwash. Men had been doing it long before this film and will continue doing it afterwards. And it's not because of video games and films.The film presents 70s Gotham as an unfair society where the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, with funds cut to medical facilities and healthcare centers. So it would only be a matter of time before things would blow up.Joaquin Phoenix is arguably the best part in this film. His shockingly skeleton figure, his painful hysterical laughter and descent into pure psychopathy is utterly mesmerizing. He absolutely should be nominated for an Oscar.",9,2,5,17 October 2019
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," It ruins it, precious
","The third installment of a famous film saga usually either triumphs or fails spectacularly. It is the latter in this case. This film truly disappoints, especially when compared to The Return Of The King. Not the least of which is its complete detachment of the joy, purity and epic feel of the Lord Of The Rings.The added swear words, painfully lengthy battle sequences, lack of deep emotional moments and the prolonged scenes of a scowling, semi-maddened Thorin just scraped out any goodness that was in the trilogy.Smaug falls after twenty minutes, random, unimportant creatures appear out of nowhere for war and worst of all, Bilbo takes a back seat throughout the whole battle. He doesn't even get use his sword, Sting, despite the poster showing him brandish it, ready for a battle he will never go to.An Unexpected Journey was quite entertaining and playful. The Desolation of Smaug started to wear thin until the introduction of the title character, the majestic and terrifying Smaug. But this one, as a sole movie, simply had no particularly interesting scenes. I only watched it for my love of the characters, and the exiting moments of the first two. But I won't be watching it again in a hurry, that's for sure.",5,5,11,30 January 2015
The Lion King," Of all the Disney movies growing up, this one has always been my favorite
","Yes, definitely my favorite hand drawn animated movie of all time. It was my favorite as a child and it still is now. This is an epic and cult tale based loosely on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Set in between Kenya or Tanzania, Africa at an unknown time, the king and queen of pride rock christen their son, Simba, as the new prince. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), however, longs for the throne, so he conjures up several plans with the hyenas to get rid of the king Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Simba. The first one doesn't work, but in the second he is half successful. Luring Simba in a stampede of wilder-beasts (The goose bump-giving score by Hans Zimmer as powerful as ever at this point) Scar gets Mufasa to save him but then, as the king climbs to the top of a rock, Scar claws him and releases him. Simba then finds his father's dead body on the ground, and while mourning him, his uncle arrives, and convinces him it was his own fault, sending him away, with the hyenas on his tail to finish him off. Simba escapes everything and runs far away. He almost dies in the desert but is then rescued by meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane) and Warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) who teach him to adapt to a sort of hippie life of good times and bug eating. Now grown, Simba (Matthew Broderick) has a run in with Nala (Moira Kelly) his childhood friend, while she hunts Pumbaa. They fall in love and she tries to convince him to go back, but he refuses. Later, while in the grasslands, he meets up with the baboon that christened him, Rafiki, and he leads him out to speak with the ghost of his father, who reminds him of who he really is and what he must do. He speeds off back to his kingdom, now degrading under the false king, to reclaim his throne and set peace to Pride Rock.I couldn't give my opinion about this film without explaining the plot, if you'll forgive me. It really is a Disney classic that's unique in so many ways. The scene in which Simba tries to wake his dead father is horribly tragic, but extremely powerful. Disney already did something similar with Bambi, with the implication that the protagonist's mother had been killed. But it had never reached to the extent that the audience saw the death or the dead body of one of the parents. The Lion King is a 100 times more powerful than Bambi. Even though I never cried at that scene, I was always very uncomfortable with it. The script is also really cool and witty and should have been nominated for the 1994 Academy Awards, along with the winner Pulp Fiction.",10,3,3,13 April 2010
Parasite," Hollywood only WISHES it produced films this good.
","After watching this, I could not stop thinking about it for several days. After the second watch, I noticed several other easter eggs, hidden gems that neatly tied all of the themes together.THIS is how movies should be made. I had expected 1917 to win all the awards, but after seeing this, I knew this was the movie that should sweep this years Oscars.And finally, the Oscars got it right in choosing a foreign-language film as Best Picture winner. And it's not hard to see why. Despite it being set in South Korea, it incorporates universal themes such as poverty, trying whatever it takes to get your family a better life and class differences.Rightfully, they'll be talking about this film for decades.",10,10,15,22 February 2020
The Greatest Showman," With a soundtrack like that, you can't really go wrong.
","This film is not a biopic, it's a musical based on P.T Barnum ideas and fantasies.Although the story itself is rather messily cut together and feels more like a music video than anything else - the film's intention is not to create something heavy, complex and gritty. It is what Barnum wanted to do with his shows: just to entertain, thrill and just be enjoyable.And that's exactly what this film does and more. The soundtrack is an absolute revelation and makes me feel happy every time I listen to it in the bus or go out for a walk. It's not meant to be taken seriously. It's just there to entertain and help you let go. And I find too few of movies these days who can truly do that for me.",7,4,8,16 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The old and the new unite
","Although I never really was a Star Wars fan, I thoroughly enjoyed the original movies in the seventies and eighties. Now more than thirty years later, the original cast is back with some new ones, and it's fantastic!Unlike many other action blockbuster movies out there, this one doesn't rely on the cheesy one-liners and overtly slapstick humour. The script and direction are spot on, and CGI is used sparingly, thank goodness. The new characters Rey, Finn and BB-8 are an amazing addition to the franchise, unlike the prequels. And when the old iconic favorites, Chewbacca, Han Solo and Leia come back in, it's simply magical. Old and new fans will relish this.",9,2,16,17 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," A vast improvement from the first one
","This film relies mostly on the action and constant threat of death, which was what the book Catching Fire really was about. The Capitol is an amazing combination of terrible violent dictatorship in a dystopian world and the sadistic need to see people tortured and killed, and Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Laurence) poses a threat to the dictators and a beacon of hope to its oppressed citizens, a symbol of freedom, a MockingJay.In the first film, the intensity started only when games began. In this one, it starts almost immediately and does not stop. Double the intensity and distress in the film makes it not only a great adaptation of the novel, but an excellent sic-fi action flick.",8,0,15,3 December 2013
Green Book," Feel good film about an oddball couple
","People complain that this film has the 'white saviour' narrative. But I didn't see it like that at all. It was about two polar opposites with different worldviews, with people treating them differently. And yet somehow, they find a way to connect with and ultimately help one another.The two performances are absolutely brilliant. Mortensen is incredibly funny and witty while Ali showcases extreme depth as a lonely, sophisticated piano player.The film is respectful to the time period, not shying away from the racism of its time, and yet still manages to maintain a certain level of comfort. Not sure if it deserved to win Best Picture, but it is certainly worthy of its acclaim.",9,2,4,11 March 2019
Shark Tale," Awfully underrated
","This animated story is set down in the ocean with the main characters as fish and mollusks. The story is about a unsatisfied tongue scrubber, Oscar, who works at the whale wash, owned by a blowfish, Mr Sykes, who has connected deals with local mob boss Don Lino. Both of them are literally in deep with the sharks. Oscar owes a huge and overdue debt to them, and his co-worker Angie, secretly in love with him, offers him the money to cover it, but he blows it all on a seahorse. Meanwhile, Don Lino is concerned about the image of his son, Lenny, who refuses to eat meat. He sends his other son, Frankie, to teach him how to hunt. They spot Oscar being tortured by Sykes's jellyfish henchmen, Ernie and Bernie and Frankie sends Lenny after him to gobble him up, but he just can't bring himself to eat a fish. Enraged, Frankie speeds after Oscar and is stopped by an anchor that lands on him and fatally wounds him. Lenny, distraught with grief and guilt, swims away. Ernie and Bernie then find Oscar beside the dead shark and assume that he killed him. Oscar now realizes he can take advantage of this and makes up a story that instantly brings him fame and fortune, and winning the heart of a beautiful but shallow lion fish, Lola. However, Don Lino, angered over the loss of his son, vows to find a way to get to him and make him pay.The message basically shows that Oscar, not knowing that Angie loves him, doesn't realize that he never needed to be at the top of the reef to feel good. Anyone who has good lives, making a good living and hanging out with friends, always want more out of life, and only once they loose the good life they had before, do they realize it. I think a lot of people can relate to that. This film has the best cast ever. The fact that all these brilliant actors are together in one film is what makes it worthwhile to watch. Robert De Niro, Will Smith, Martin Scorsese, Angelina Jolie, Renée Zelweger and Jack Black. I loved this film so much that I became obsessed with all the actors who appeared in it. It introduced me to Mafia films, which of course contained some of the best in all of film history. It also has an excellent soundtrack full of brilliant music, which in my opinion, is a thing a great movie has to have.Unfortunately, this picture has now become terribly underrated, so much that people don't even want to hear about it anymore, let alone praise it. After Shrek, Dreamworks produced this great film, then a second Shrek (not as good as the first one, but better than the third) and Madagascar. The latter, though compared to Shark Tale, was a disappointment, it became one of the last last good movies that Dreamworks Animation released. They just seemed to have lost it now. Even the acclaimed How To Train Your Dragon, which was much better than some of the previous Dreamwork films, lacks anything exceptional. Only Kung Fu Panda and Megamind seems to capture the real essence of Shark Tale and the first Shrek. They always mention Shrek and Madagascar in their new films, but never Shark Tale, which is a real shame. When you look it like that, there's really nothing bad about it. It's a funny comedy that really lifts your spirits. Pixar often continues makes outstanding movies, but I'll always remember this one as the film that introduced me to the real masterpieces of cinema.",10,19,24,4 April 2010
