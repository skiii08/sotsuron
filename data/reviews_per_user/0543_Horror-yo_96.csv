The Mask," Comedy Classic.
","This film has typically gone underrated. This is Jim Carrey's introduction to the major international public, and just like every other film he'd star in, he steals the show. As I ask in almost all my Carrey-starring movie reviews: could this film have even existed, or been efficient at any level, with ANYONE ELSE but Jim Carrey ? This guy is like Michael Jordan for a basketball team. You may have mediocre coaching, game-plan or even other players, but with very little and him on your squad, you can still achieve greatness or at very least glimpses of it. People forget that underneath the graphical effects, there's Jim Carrey. He's the Mask more than CGI or costumes. The film is funny, fun, entertaining if you'll only go into it with the according mindset. It's a nice tribute to the Tex Avery's and old school cartoonish classics, and a wacky, wacky premise to even begin with. It's also got a bit of morality: we all wear masks; and also the Mask itself is only power, it is the one who wears it who determines if he transforms into a positive weirdo, or a monster. Well written, fun watch. A classic.",8,2,2,19 May 2016
Insidious: Chapter 2," sort of entertaining, but fairly bad
","The first one was a good horror. Nobody can say the opposite of that. Not a masterpiece, but a solid horror at least. Obviously we want something of about the same caliber for the sequel.Where the first one had genuine story telling, this one had just bland development with pieces and themes from a bunch of other thriller-horrors. Where the first had drive and emotion, this one had just some more flat action. Where the first one had good structure and tension, this one is slightly random/uneven and with slowdowns in rhythm. Where the first one had good scares, this one is just some more of that PG13 Hollywood mainstream horror.This is basically a lazy continuation of the first, with no real motive or at least a failed attempt at building from the original and recreating a piece that is as challenging and that keeps the same quality formula while expanding on other possible notions of the Insidious realm. It's just leaning on the first, bringing uninteresting, predictable explanations to a film that didn't need any. Parasitic, feeding off the originality of the first without bringing anything itself.There's absolutely nothing notorious or memorable about it, and most if not all scenes are a letdown. There isn't a section or concept in the 100 minutes that remotely push the boundaries of the series or offer authentic thought or artistic vision.Check it out yourself if you liked the first, but the people on here calling it a 'masterpiece' or whatever need to stop whatever they're doing wrong in life in general...seems very dangerous, whatever it is.",5,11,22,10 December 2013
Vertigo," Fine, but over-hyped
","As with many such films, this one starts out with a very intriguing premise which tension only builds up as the elements of the plot flourish more and more towards the middle of the development... before stalling some during the last third of the film, somewhat toning down the fine quality of the early viewing. This film is too long for its own good, and has a bit of a rare 'symptom' of peaking too soon. It seems all the pressure fomented in the first hour is already resolved well before the final act of the film, and although there is certainly matter to the second half of the story, a lot of the essential atmosphere and purpose the film was subtly weaving for a while are put to sleep before a different kind of tone or 'color' (*wink wink*) completely takes over - one that is much more obvious, ordinary, maybe somewhat tedious. The first half is so mysterious, intimate, smooth, suspenseful, hauntingly romantic... and all this is traded away for a more conventional affair. Finally, the very title of the film seems a little misleading if not a lot, especially given this is a Hitchcock, where one would really expect something different and isn't necessarily given a worthy compensation for it. Overall, it's a fine film, but weaker in some respects than it seems it is given credit for.",7,1,2,28 June 2016
Scarface," Provokes a reflexion about cinematography altogether.
","Won't give it a grade. Haven't seen it in a while, won't be accurate like I like.Very quick set of digressing questions that will forge a review for this film:A film. Could it be a minimalist plot, easy and gratuitous caricatures of characters and generic/drone music as a setting - along with - graphic violence, the 'cool' factor ('cool' being the characters' attitudes, grins, walking styles...etc), gangsters/drugs/guns and climactic tensions ? The answer is a resounding 'no', quite obviously.How is this art ? Isn't cinematography supposed to be a form of Art ? The seventh art (as we call it in France...).Is it okay to watch an action movie and be mildly entertained for a couple of hours...perhaps. But it isn't art, and it's planets...nay, universes away from being a masterpiece.Thank you for reading.",Null,0,2,13 September 2011
Requiem for a Dream," Needlessly dark, depressing and extreme
","If you're looking for a classic film with a strong resolution to the plot and powerful meaning, definitely skip this one.What's to say... the cinematography is superb, the director obviously does very well to convey the moods and intents of every scene, all mounting into a pretty extreme rush in the end, but style without substance never achieved anything in cinema and this one here is just another hollow artistic piece.Of course there's 'meaning', there's symbolism and a clear depiction of the subconscious mind and how it manifests itself to the individual, but to watch all of this just to find nothing in the end but the logical, empty conclusion it is just isn't viable.Too bleak, too dark, too depressing and way too overt and extreme for very very little in the end. Unnecessarily aggressive to the mind, there are plenty of other ways to make a point and represent harsh realities in cinema.",2,0,6,20 November 2017
Skyfall," This is it. Stop making JB films, please...PLEASE !!!
","As I was watching...first scene.......an hour into the movie...another hour into the movie....then finally as I'm sitting here thinking this review up, I mean to be complacent, nice with this film and the people who liked it. Personally, I was bored to death with this thing; but like I said, I'll cut it some slack a bit, because maybe I'm just not a Bond guy. My direct criticism is this: first scene is some of the same. Action, action, action. Then, every once in a while, the clever little quips, the pretty girls and the tension-building scenes including them, casino-like places, chic futuristic aesthetics, a cold Bond (cold as ever), and even the inclusion this time (which I won't comment) of a hint at Bond's sexual curiosity (as in having had gay sex before, to be perfectly clear).In the complacent side of my mind, there's this: it's Bond, what do you expect ?! It's supposed to have all this ! It's supposed to be smart-ass-ish, full of action, artsy, fashionable, superficial yet classy, pretty girls etc...In the no BS part of my brain though, this: action, fine, but renewed, not the SAME OLD car chases and fights on trains. Girls and casinos and the one-liners and company? Who can possibly be a fan, a genuine justified fan of such redundancy when this is the EXACT SAME FORMULA for, what, 25 James Bonds now ?Too long, plot all over the place, NOTHING new (except Bond is bi...), heavy-handed ending, typical villain, the girls sucked (nothing like the usual impressive entrances and all...) Theme was nice, and even though I hate Adele's voice the composition itself is well written...This thing *could* be criticized for longer, but there's no point. Overall, that's all that needs to be said. Flat and repetititititititititititititititit...........(sorry, got stuck here)...titititive.",4,7,16,20 February 2013
Finding Neverland," Neverland definitely NOT Found
","In short, this is a smooth viewing, but it clearly falls short in what it's supposed to supply. The good points are the entertaining watch this provides, Johnny Depp, an excellent child actor's performance (Peter), the ever so beautiful Radha Mitchell (hah...), and all in all the good story being told here.The problem is the great potential such a story/casting/philosophical point holds and is absolutely necessary to be fulfilled. And this clearly, clearly falls short of it. We're given a taste of what it could've been like, we're given glimpses of what could've been achieved here; but only sketches, elusive hints...never the real thing. This could've been a magical motion picture that dives the viewer into Neverland, and all the premises full of wonderful emotion and artistic/human sensitivity that come with it. In stead, this is a fairly flat realization of its plot, with interesting potential, never reached. Clearly not greatness, but also as clear was the potential for greatness.",7,0,0,2 August 2016
John Wick," Keanu Reeves kills 150 people and it's pretty cool to watch
","Read a review calling it 'kinetic'. That's pretty much it. Good guy seeks revenge on bad guy and his minions, plot is thin so it's all about style, and this does a pretty darn good job considering just how hollow and clichéd the story is.Actually good soundtrack, good taste in music and a score fairly diverse but always coherent with the scenes. The dialog gets a bit too stereotypical on occasion but there's some good fun there, and there's enough in the film to make it a relevant watch without completely despairing as you'd think from such an utterly action-oriented production.The cinematography is actually quite good and visually, this movie deserves to be seen in high definition.It's really pretty good for how little there is to work with. 6.5/10.",6,0,4,17 October 2016
Chinatown," Tedious, cliché, wildly overrated, cold, and trite
","*NO SPOILER YET* In case you're wondering why the incredibly high ratings, bear in mind this is a Polanski (all the cinema lovers, 'intellectuals' and critics' favorite) starring now classic Jack Nicholson in a typical film noir that takes itself so very seriously it's almost telling you you have to love it or else you're not a true cinema purist.To be honest, Nicholson as the other actors put in a good performance. Dunaway is alright but not nearly brilliant, but anyways the point is even incredibly talented actors couldn't make mediocrity into greatness. The script is fine if you're a fanatic of crime films, but if you just so happen not to be particularly this is the slowest 2hrs10min you've seen in a long time. In a long time. The pacing is S-L-O-W, you couldn't quite call this piece exactly 'stimulating'. The very plot is completely ordinary - big powerful bad guy covers up his horrible crimes and wants more money more power, complicated story about L.A.'s water and who owns it (wow no fascinating) - and has no edge to it whatsoever for the genre. What is considered 'superb structure' can just as easily feel like a ton of events that pile up and further sinks the film into a delirium of enduring boredom where instead of being uneventful, it is full of stuff happening, but all of which are dull and typical.What's more, there's nothing else about the film that helps lift the bland quality of the whole: dialog has no particular wit and also subscribes to the typical formula, the humor is corny, there's no real moral or actual greater point, the emotional dimension is fake and cold, the cinematography is flat and linear, and there isn't even that big old ending at the end that could've perhaps given legitimacy to the darn thing.*SPOILER* - the Dunaway mother/sister thing is ridiculous and unnecessary and brings no strength to the plot, the fact she dies in the end right in front of that poor traumatized kid is senseless and also with no worth, how it's strongly implied the grandfather wants to sexually abuse her too and grabs her and takes her away is just insanely unnecessary and anti-climactic. And the clues towards the end are technically ridiculous: so of all places he drowns the guy in his pool in his backyard (conveniently the only place with salt water in the whole entire perimeter), of course drops his glasses in there and in order to read that paper at the end he pulls out and wears the exact same pair...Lots of flaws there. You can like it and all, but the flaws are certainly there.",3,14,26,1 December 2017
Se7en," Highly overrated Fincher Crime/Drama
","This film serves as a stage for a nice thriller's premise, a serial killer who commits his crimes with the theme of the 'seven deadly sins', the ever popular biblical concept. Throw in Brad Pitt, the young hard-nose copper and his associate, the more seasoned, gathered Morgan Freeman who serves as a token of maturity and intellectual analysis, Gwyneth Paltrow as the always worried lovely blonde, and the villain, portrayed by an excellent actor who, quite honestly, makes the ending into anything good at all. The movie is too long, too bloody/gory for no good reason, the off-plot filler dialog is awful and irrelevant, why with such a theme for the film they couldn't think up anything compelling for their protagonists to say ?? The ending revolves heavily around certain characters, and besides the fact it's terribly acted out by Brad Pitt particularly, it is an escalated climax to something that hasn't gained enough momentum to really be dramatic. We get what the film-makers were trying to do, but considering everything that could've been achieved, this is but a pale, over-long, hollow and quite unprofessional rendering of what it could've/should've been. Solid film still; still a solid premise and relevant enough to warrant a viewing.",7,1,4,21 May 2016
Citizen Kane," Very definitely massively overrated, but still fairly good
","It's Orson Welles. The pseudo-intellectuals, especially nowadays with the immense classic status this film has cropped over the decades, will put this sort of film in the highest order of things simply because it's Orson Welles, the great American iconoclast cinematic intellectual of the time with this highly critical piece of film.Now, for the film itself, it's fairly good, but lacks in various places. Sure there's criticism of the society of the time, there's criticism about politics and more largely criticism of the individual ego, the vanity of men; the ending is authentic and the whole movie works in one direction and has coherence to its lore; and all of that is fine; but ultimately one could find it content-wise the film isn't the most entertaining, a common fault of Welles', that it seems it is the *narrative* of the film that takes the place of ...the film itself. It's like the film has to go through a painful bulk at the center, tediously going through a logical development of the situation and plot, before it can finally give the ending away. Some parts are too long for their own good, for their own point to be made (the whole opera singing thing), and overall one gets an impression of non-interactive coldness, blandness; as a lot of the early events just aren't very interesting (the newspaper days..). There isn't enough surprise, tension, dynamic content; Citizen Kane takes its sweet time to get to the not unpredictable or particularly subtle places it chooses to go; the film just lets its story casually played out and the conclusions are quite obvious (though rather good) even for the time. I understand cinematographically this is a strong and important film, but as a film in itself or even for the point it's making, it's not top notch.",6,0,4,17 July 2016
Memento," Nolan's best, most certainly
","First off, this reviewer thinks Nolan is a massively overrated, so definitely no bias/fanboy-ness here. On its own, this film is superb. It's a good concept, and an even better execution of it. The plot, despite having a very plain core, is actually quite complex and strengthened by strong dialog and other secondary elements, such as the anecdotes for one. All relevant to the plot. Guy Pearce is an excellent actor, however almost too discreet he may always be or difficult to grasp, he puts in just the right performance for this lead role, so very demanding in the field of tight proximity with the audience and raw, realistic acting. So much of the film lays entirely on his shoulders and performance, and it's no coincidence it's such a strong film. The cinematography is deliberately simple, and he is at the center of every scene. The film is straight-to-the-point and there is enough actual story substance that this never feels like it lingers on about the plot or stretches the main concept and rather actively moves forward smoothly. Ultimately, beyond the 'mere' structural strength and unusual chronological format, quality acting and cinematography generally; there is a genuine point, an actual meaning to the story rather than just a (good) story. The twist at the end contributes enormously to the film's strength while maintaining coherence, giving true closure to the story and a sizeable morality; as opposed to soaring out of context as to provide a bigger surprise (which Nolan often does in his films, actually).",9,0,3,21 May 2016
Inglourious Basterds," Politically tainted // Excellent cinematic experience
","Let's start with 
<ul><li>the good: Tarantino every once in a while is going to get into a zone and produce a superb concept, style and atmosphere and this time he made Inglorious Basterds. The concept was really good here as far as a purely cinematic experience. It's realistic and enticing from that very first scene, arguably one of the best intros ever. The rest of the film is a succession of equally powerful scenes, intense/suspenseful or flat out explosive, sometimes graphic.</li></ul>The characters are lots of fun, almost comic book like for some (well for most, really). The subplots and independent little stories each bring lots of positives and an ongoing dynamism to the film which never lets down pace wise. We're fed a ton of entertainment, but not in a linear or repetitive way (as with all action films), and with each progression there's new suspense or climaxes to be met.Some characters have remained classics among the young mainstream, as well as certain quotes.Technically, there's a great melding of all traditional cinematographic genres: romance, comedy, action, historic, drama... and the film is consistent at being just as good when it starts as when it finishes, without any drop in intensity, or quality, all the way til the end.It's just got that contagious and exciting aura and movie magic that only very few pictures manage to generate. It's special, and if you're intrigued by the start, you'll not want to look away for all 2h33 of it.-The bad: the film carries a strongly partisan view and hijacks over-the-top tongue in cheek comedy as a pretext to push its own agenda. This isn't a film that you could call politically neutral, at all. Too bad as the rest was so good as contemporary cinema, but the non-cinematic commentary and motive of the film taint it quite badly. Easily could've done without the politicizing, and just focused on the fun and strong cinema it is otherwise.",5,1,4,19 August 2018
12 Monkeys," Beautiful, poetic, like an ever-flowing stream...
","This ...is a brilliant film right here. This brings together all of dystopian sci-fi in its most thought-provoking, grim imagery, excellent story-telling that is consistent from the very first scene to that highly emotional ending, subplots that are intentionally distracting enough to serve as lure and densify the main plot - all while having Bruce Willis play the main character excellently, along with the beautiful and also very good Madeleine Stowe, strong cinematography always very contagious with its visuals, its ambiance with carefully picked and adequate background music, always a sentiment of urgency and danger and instability throughout... But more essentially, there is a beautiful poetry about the end of the world's theme, like a romanticism of the apocalypse and hopelessness, the Sisyphus myth, a ringing echo of eternal repetition, a man who will do everything he can even when nobody believes him to try to literally save the world, against all odds, and the beautiful love relationship that is forged through this most unique destiny; and finally, the full ending chapter is masterful at how it brings back abstract past references from earlier, and the film makes you understand something enormous is about to take place and you just can't look away. Excellence on various levels, ambitious and totally accomplished. Either a 9 or a 10.",9,1,2,21 May 2016
Stripes," A little bit of cheap fun, definitely not essential
","They'll sell this as a comedy classic due to merely the release date, the names Bill Murray or John Candy, and the subconscious association with comedy quality this all coincides into.The truth is this is far too long although not particularly boring to watch, running over two hours; that nothing about it is specifically hilarious or in good taste, in fact some of it is pretty weird and forced, and overall it was quite an avoidable production, but it's fun, it's got lots of action and events taking place and it's in the sort of spirit that Americans love to love, what with a subtle dose of propaganda, an established perception that everything outside home is wilderness, and the way the main characters handle themselves as studs who always win.",5,1,3,18 October 2016
12 Angry Men," Brilliant classic, believe the hype
","This film starts out and you have no idea how the heck the movie-makers were going to make a full-length piece out of it. And yet they did. And how. Henry Fonda plays superbly well, as all actors, in this argumentative arm-wrestle between heart and brains, the 'heart' being the humane aspect and utter respect for others, and 'brains' being the logical, cerebral but ultimately lazy approach to problems. There is a very, very strong morality in this film, and unlike what you'd think, it is very, very subtly implied, carefully placed throughout the genes of this masterpiece, and very strongly executed. This film is pure acting where film is closest to acting on a theater stage. This film is asking philosophical questions with purpose and meaning and depth rather than fancy intellectual babbling. And it is a grande analysis of the psychology of men, on many different levels and in a plurality of examples. And never in excess, or exaggeration. Not one over-dramatic scene. Just right. Brilliant.",9,1,2,18 May 2016
"I Love You, Man"," Better than expected
","One glance at the poster and one could expect this to be way too obvious from the getgo.Of course, it absolutely is a totally mainstream, formatted comedy with conform Hollywood structure and a comedy spoonfed to the audience with an obvious moral at the end...etc... but exactly in that regard, it's not as bad as it 'should've been'.It actually does surprisingly well at developing itself very quickly for the setup at the end. This film's goal was to create a strong relationship between two friends, and have the ending carry meaning and feel the right way in just 1hr45, which isn't an easy task even for formulaic Hollywood.It's actually funnier than expected, with some genuinely funny moments and secondary characters, and although it's not as powerful as the title claims, it's still solid and a fun watch that isn't boring at any particular moment.7/10.",7,1,1,1 March 2017
Batman Returns," Boring
","If given a little bit more content, Tim Burton could've made something good out of this, but it's just paper thin. Where the first one had a lightness about it and had very good rhythm, action and fitting humor, this one is explosions, explosions, more explosions and totally stale moments where one is left wondering why he's watching at points.It takes itself seriously, has far too little matter at its core, and one has quickly paid off the excitement of seeing the Penguin or Catwoman, then it's just more of the same and it lacks rhythm and is much too predictable, thin.4/10.",4,50,84,29 October 2016
The Great Dictator," Hilarious, and very good, as usual...
","If you know Chaplin at all by now, and by that I mean you actually have seen his full films attentively, you know he rightfully deserves the legendary status he's so widely given. The man was a genius of his own craft, and besides being a film-maker/story writer and obviously very good actor/entertainer of many fields/music composer... as a mere comic, just as a mere comic he could be hilarious in many different ways: through his nervy mimics and tricks and facial/whole body gymnastics, his interaction with surrounding props, situational comedy, coming up with ridiculous visual ideas for a scene, ridiculous concepts for a character's name or attributes, with his own voice... he was the complete entertainer/performer, and this being said not nearly in the cold academic,'accomplished artist' sort of way, but truly a creator of on-screen magic, provoker of visceral and sincere laughter, and a man whose greatest quality were in fact none of these things, but the weight of his heart and the great warmth of his humanity. All of this finds truth and application in this film in particular as he's in full-blown Chaplin mode and displays his full effect here. The famous speech this film is notorious for deserves recognition as it is in essence good while of course utopic, and although it seems the film was made for that scene they did a good job really crafting a good motion picture in itself, as a whole. Structurally the film isn't perfect, it's very good for the first 3/4s but then perhaps slows down in pace for a little while towards the end before lifting off again with that final speech. All in all, it's a great comedy. You'll find at least something funny somewhere in it, and as a film it's an entertaining, well made bit of cinema.",8,1,2,25 July 2016
Constantine," Holy Christianity themed zombie/werewolf/vampire mishmash B-Film...
","...starring Keanu Reeves. The latter, the only aspect prompting me to go through this. Looking at the overall reception, it could've been at least decent. Instead, when the earlier stages, very dodgy in parts but still, seem to be putting some slabs together, you very quickly find out the dodgy was all there is and the film isn't going anywhere, and it's more cheesy lines about the rules of the film, unlikely weirdo characters popping up and doing their thing.This could be cut short by saying it actually had potential in its narrative and concept to be genuinely interesting, but instead went exactly the other way from that. Embarrassing feature for Reeves, the film-makers probably thought they'd ride the Matrix wave and setup something somewhat similar for/with him and, who knows, get a little lucky maybe ?...with this ?",3,1,5,7 October 2016

","Excellent cast of actors. Good cinematography. Excellent balance between the drama and comedy aspects, makes for a very fluid viewing. Structurally strong, never a dull moment, good script. Very eventful, good substance to the film, a very unique flavor, this isn't 'just another Tim Burton with Depp as the lead', Depp produces a very particular performance playing Ed Wood, fun to watch and special. Very humane film, and quite concrete. Not at all your fancy artsy fartsy type. Very funny in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way in parts, the ending in particular. Between biographical and fantasy, a great mixture that rings coherently. Very good Tim Burton.",8,2,2,17 May 2016
L.A. Confidential," Excellent 90's crime
","This is a subtly crafted, multi-layered action-crime movie that excels on a number of levels, and does just about everything in that textbook 'just right' way. It's a story of jealousy, power, men in competition and friendship, with a feel for the mysterious, and an interesting angle on 'the right thing to do'. Superb cast of actors. Tension very well built. The story is complex but not over-complicated, and never goes overboard with excess. It's just right, and makes for a very smooth viewing. There's just enough dialog, well written and believable, and then it also delivers the goods in terms of hard-hitting action, but while always keeping the plot in check. Top notch crime from the 90's, possibly a golden age for the genre, and if you're ever going to watch one, start with this one. You can't go wrong. All the ingredients are there.",8,0,2,18 May 2016
The Prestige," Over-complicated mess of a Nolan
","Christopher Nolan, the co-writer/director, loves to over-complicate his films a lot, especially in his twists in the endings, and counts on the simplicity of the masses to get confused and be called a genius despite failing to deliver in his films' ultimate goals: the twists at the end, because most of his films rely on those heavily to be given any meaning or quality at all. In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment. It's like the end discredits everything that's been building for long chunks of Nolan produce, like the film shoots itself in the foot (or in the head ?). Too bad. This feels like a great, but it surely isn't.",6,6,12,18 May 2016
Snatch," Not as good as Lock, quite massively overrated
","I get that at the time this came out, there weren't legions of such action packed convoluted rougher type comedies, but for crying out loud 'Lock' came out before this, by the same Guy Ritchie, and it was heaps better. If anything, strangely enough, it feels like Lock was the more mature film made some years later, not before.It's not as smooth in the action sequences, it's got too much talking that doesn't amount to much effect, pretty stupid braindead type dialog, supposedly witty but really completely forgettable banal lines, tries hard in many places; something like Brad Pitt's character was good in concept but honestly could've been much funnier in execution, they could've really made him sound hilarious when here he's just confusing to listen to.Where 'Lock' had lots of well incorporated subplots and micro-twists, this here gets overcomplicated too fast, too many characters, and the viewer can't be screwed to put in all that effort to remember insignificant details, as the film never makes it a point to warrant your full attention on every aspect of this very ordinary production. Too much focus demanded for far too little a reward.5.5/10.",5,4,9,21 February 2017
Taxi Driver," Nihilistic in its spirit and its structure: a feeble attempt to display power
","As every single other Scorcese movie, this one is strangely as well as massively overrated.I'll make this simple: if you're not sucked into the senseless, remote action going on there's nothing left but the weakest and most pernicious and ambiguous moral at the end.The film is completely random in every possible way: the worst way being at its core, it is nihilistic and unnecessarily bleak. The entire first part of the film for instance with Cybill Shepherd serves no purpose in the storyline but is rather a fully interchangeable/disposable introduction to the film and means to merely convey the notion Deniro's character longs for emotional connection and companionship, but they could've replaced that entire part with a number of other ones in a way that wouldn't shake up the story at all.There's no explanation or significant reason for the turn of events and the change in texture and atmosphere of the film as Deniro's character becomes exceedingly more extreme: just as everything in this darn thing, conclusions are jumped to and never given a prior development. Things just happen, because the movie-makers (writer and director) were disturbingly inept at their jobs of creating coherent structure and developing a plot and its various ideas.Some scenes are just purely random (why the attempted assassination of Palantine ?), added to the just as unnecessary violence and this here is only a 'personal nightmare' for the viewer, not Deniro's character and what not.Philosophically bleak, not dark or haunting just bleak, as in stupid and morally violent, and pernicious. Influential ? This couldn't influence a hair in my nose. Terrible cinema, terrible story telling, terrible everything. Okay dialogue, De Niro's good...2/10.",2,5,10,8 November 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," Good film, terribly dense/heavy - boring
","As subjective as it may seem, I cannot avoid making the comment this film was a bit boring. Painful to watch. There's a strain that the narrative builds over the watcher, the pressures of an incredibly tough and depressing series of life events, where a viewer may be left thinking: 'well I don't have an issue with dramas or tough films, but why focus on such difficult and common life events ?' It's one of these things about historical movies - a particular event having occurred doesn't necessarily make for a great film plot or story to tell. The incredibly rough Great Depression years were awful and all, sure, but to make 2 hours plus of film based on the Steinbeck novel... this is like an American Emile Zola, an American Germinal. That monotonous old naturalism/realism narrative of exploring the misery of the working class... why, out of everything else there is to write about or make a film about... You'd ask yourself why an author would focus all his energy on something so bleak and real, there's such a lack of fantasy, the story telling is just totally flat and linear. What, we're barely given 30 seconds of poetry at the end from Fonda and then a speech from the mother in that last scene, but 2hrs10 for that ?...Good film. Tough to watch. 6.5/10.",7,1,3,27 December 2016
Forrest Gump," Excellent film, somewhat disappointing ending
","This here is just as good as you may've heard, it's one of those films that develop legendary status as the years and decades pile on, and it delivers on the quality expected from all the hype. The story is based on a novel, which explains the excellent structure of the plot but the directing was very competent in making this a moving, genuinely thought-provoking and interesting piece of art. It belongs in the category of long, drama films, but it never gets 'long' and the 'drama' never gets over-dramatic. The tension is excellently managed, the acting is very good, and in spite of its said long run-time the films is filled with events, meaningful characters and very good dialog, and it never concedes to self-complacency - objectively this is strong cinema through and through. True quality. The Gary Sinise character who represents the human ego, and Gump as a symbol that intelligence of the heart is infinitely superior and more valuable than intelligence of the mind. The only true concern for an easy-going, indulgent movie viewer is that the film builds such tremendous momentum, is so flawlessly told and crafted, that one would certainly expect an adequately superb finish, an emphatic ultimate exclamation point; not something extraordinarily life-changing but something rich in the same emotion and genuinely interesting/profound quality the whole film as a platform had built seamlessly for two hours plus. Such great classic stories end with a beautiful and fulfilling sense of utter satisfaction, and this does seem to fall slightly short of that, so it may not merit a full grade. 8.5/10.",8,1,1,2 August 2016
The Matrix Revolutions," Better than the second - Nowhere near the first - Altogether disappointing conclusion to the trilogy
","There's no questioning the first one is by far the better film in the trilogy. However, opinions about the second and third volumes differ very often.
Despite this one having just as much action as the second one, there's an epic tone to the action scenes and context with philosophical undertones to the central theme (man vs machine, and the implications behind that narrative) whereas the Matrix Reloaded was just sheer Hollywood blockbuster action for the sake of action: senseless, lengthy action with no meaning or purpose besides being spectacular big production spectacle. This film is close to the second one though in how it delivers plenty of utterly clichéd manufactured one-liners and obvious stereotypes that always come up in war/action movies.All in all, this film delivers a lot more answers and story content and wisdom than the previous volume, but fails at being emotionally potent like the first one was. The scenes set up to be the most poignant and powerful fall short in terms of punch and efficiency, for e.g. Trinity's death or even Neo's for that matter and the ending as a whole.It feels globally like parts II and III were just manufactured Hollywood productions that fed off the Matrix universe, with a few good elements: the Architect and Merovingian in 2, here some of the imagery (Zion battle or the machine city) and some good scenes (most of the ones involving Mr.Smith). After being subjected to the utterly mind-altering experience that was The Matrix (original) it certainly feels disappointing ultimately to be fed such a bland ending with almost no power or moving quality to it. Better than the second for sure, more back on track in the Matrix universe, but not anywhere near the first in any regard.7/10 for epicness, relentless and intense action that manages not to feel boring, and a good effort to at least attempt to conclude probably the greatest sci-fi of all-time that blew everyone away at the end of the 90's.",7,2,3,27 May 2019
Cast Away," Good but left hungry at the end
","This is one of those films that seems to set up everything in the story for a massive emotional landing, with a lead actor like Tom Hanks, the same director as Forest Gump's, and this incredible journey the protagonist goes through... one could feel that something great is in the brewing process. But not really. Not at all, in fact. The very beginning is pretty boring up until the crash scene which is amazing, and much more intense if not brutal than one would expect of such a mainstream production while not being overdone either. Just a great cinematic moment on all accounts.Then, it was very ambitious to make a film with such a main idea. The film goes on 2hrs25min, and the bulk of it does take place on that island. And yet it never gets boring and as an audience we're spontaneously mandated to participate in the adventure as being people ourselves we immediately relate to the great difficulty of surviving both physically, and mentally in such dire conditions. The film does a good job staying fresh from scene to scene, and not bordering on the purely depressing realm this easily could've dwelt in.The problem is a highly forgettable final act, it's made clear at the end that there isn't any of that earlier high promise that will be fulfilled and a very ordinary and flat-out weak, if not also ambiguous and unclear in itself conclusion to a story that seemed to possess immense potential on an emotional and human level. Some elements that seemed important get a very plain and often disappointing resolution in the ending narrative, and one really would've wished for a much stronger depiction of the protagonist's relationship with his dearest love of his life, something of a deeper kind with parallels back and forth between his current, hindering life and the one he longs to get back.",7,0,0,24 September 2016
Little Miss Sunshine," Excellent comedy
","You won't find a whole lot better in this field. This is a very strongly written, superbly executed comedy with authenticity and real purpose - rather than your self-indulgent, super specific comedy flick that relies on its one-trick pony gamble. It's this quasi-perfect balance between genuine comedic material, with some actually hilarious parts, and true script-work and story. The funny occurs within the many well constructed events of the plot, and there isn't ever anything that strays away from the point, like some forced humor on the side; all the while making for an absolute blast of a ride, and more literally of a road trip. The acting is particularly good, on all accounts. The casting is superb, spot-on. And the criticism and morality, as in the crux of the film, are never given away, or easy. Everything works for the greater scheme that is the film as a whole; there is a great coherence and smoothness about this, and overall one could say it is as fun as it is ultimately human, and in that it's a beautiful comedy, to be watched by anyone from all ages. A comedy with universal appeal. Superb.",9,0,0,28 June 2016
North by Northwest," Far-fetched action-packed Hitchcock starring Cary Grant
","The main criticism one could have for this film is that in the midst of such action and secretive James Bond like intrigues, the viewer may very well at some point feel like the protagonist is just too naive and his adventures seem a bit too unlikely in that particular succession of events. The point of the film was obviously non-stop action, a genuine sense of entertainment throughout, and for the time very impressive visuals, as the ending scene is an absolute token of; and while the dialog is very good and in parts superb, and there is enough to keep the viewer's attention with the various characters, the stakes, the mystery, the action and very good performances given by Grant, Mason, Saint... the film still feels a bit 'far-fetched', like it really wants to go somewhere and stops at nothing to, even if it may've benefited from strengthening the 'how' to get there. Overall the plot is quite clever, and again it's very well executed and a fun ride, but it's fairly long and perhaps counts on the candor of its protagonist a bit too much, and slightly on the overcomplicated side of the action-crime spectrum.",6,2,4,28 June 2016
American Beauty," American beauty, American excellence
","American Beauty...is such a special film in that if you saw the trailer and knew about the basic plot, skimmed through the actors, you'd expect one thing - a predictable tale of modern America's criticism of how the middle class is decaying and has created a society full of dysfunctionals and sickos underneath the surface... - and that one thing you expected, is exactly what you get; however, they still made it a brilliant film. The subplots contribute to the overall feel of the film, so mysterious and magical. The characters are extreme but mirror our society so perfectly that they are outright fictional caricatures and yet remind us of people we all have known. This is a modern fairy-tale motion picture which holds as a main theme the despondency of all members of our society, each layer (teenagers, young adults, parents...) with its own specific existential fracture. The story is excellent, right from the start and throughout the bulk of the movie, up until the excellent climax at the end that is oh so fitting and a true powerful finish - and there is a romanticism about the atmosphere whether through narration, music or image; like a poetry of death. And it's actually moving, rather than plain immoral or silly. This sick world we've put around ourselves.",9,0,1,18 May 2016
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Sci-fi Action excellence
","While the first one was more raw science fiction and overall had a much more serious feel, almost like horror at times - this one, 7 years later, has a much lighter tone to it, all the while remaining a heavy weight blockbuster action thriller. The film-makers turned the table interestingly and it worked: Arnie was this time the good guy, setting up the stage for the older model but likable good guy robot-killer, now back to protect, vs the newer technology evil robot, and where Arnie was all heavy metal with boots and dark shades with heavy punches and kicks and robust weaponry, bad guy T-1000 was smooth, stealthy, lightning quick, surgically precise and sharp, while superior in intelligence and strategy. Put this way, it makes for quite an exciting prospect of a plot on its own, doesn't it ? And the movie delivers. The superiority of the T-1000 is well illustrated, and Arnie and the heroes keep up/escape in a believable way. The film even manages to generate emotion from the viewing public towards a robot, and nobody from this past radius of contemporary generations will ever, ever forget that ending, with Arnie's thumb raised. Globally, an excellently executed sci-fi action from the early 90's. James Cameron did another superb job there, and the film may not be the deepest in cinema history, but it sure provides the goods it promises, and for a sequel, and a sequel that's widely regarded as even superior to its original, an absolute classic in its own right; this is pretty damn strong.",8,3,4,22 May 2016
Edward Scissorhands," Beautiful, moving, rare, quality cinema
","Tim Burton at his best as he not only directs this but was one of the writers. The ultimate ode to the oddball. Whoever you are and in whatever quality you may've been treated wrong because you were different, whether for race, creed, religion or whatever, this will speak volumes to you. This is one of these pieces that urges to show the viewer who the real monsters are, and where true beauty really lies, and in a way that applies to so many situations in the daily life. But this isn't easy, self-indulgent or gratuitous. From the pastel-colored neighborhood and houses, to the utter uniformity of its people from the way their dress to the way they behave, the conform/biased understanding of right and wrong... both highly interesting and applicable food for thought. The story is so perfectly crafted to accommodate its plan, and it never lets out; we're given about 1hr45 of strongly crafted, constantly renewed plot and story, with each scene and more largely each section depicting a particular emotion, lesson or deep symbol. This is only strengthened by excellent score music from Elfman, in parts highly moving, and visually the film is greatly and so delicately poetic all the while being so unique and authentic. No film had ever felt like Edward Scissorhands, and no film has since.",9,1,1,4 June 2016
Van Helsing," Terrible, terrible big budget waste
","It's got Hugh Jackman (the big actor), it's got the luscious Kate Beckinsale (the hottie), it's got big budget.It's got werewolves mixed with Jeckyll n Hyde, the Frankenstein monster and Dracula. Along with zombies, hot female vamps and the rest of the mystical creatures - all in a blender of pure incoherence, cheapness, horrible horrible taste and zero sense of logic or purpose for the film.I can't think of worse - no, literally I cannot - as far as the expression 'bad taste' goes for cinema.All the ingredients are there friends: the most pathetic one-liners, terrible script, cliché superficial acting exclusive to those soulless big-budget Hollywood turds, the terrible zooms and 'cool expressions' on the guy's face, the bad CGI ideas and huge setups and decors that don't help the paper thin depth of it all...The movie starts with the typical live action - tasteless. Before introducing all the other 'characters' conveniently and with the same odorless momentum. The ending is the big ass fight between the 2 big dudes, and they lived happily ever after with money in their pockets, a moment of fame, and a dreadful, shitty film. Yup, that bad ! Two out of ten. (in stead of 1/10 just because Beckinsale's presence is poetry in itself)",2,1,5,7 October 2011
The Machinist," Pure excellence
","The Machinist subscribes to the Jacob's Ladder type film lineage where the entire thing is one big metaphor. Here, Christian Bale delivers an excellent performance as Trevor Reznik, a profoundly dysfunctional, out-of-touch zombie of a man who ...'hasn't slept in a year'. The entire movie, and I do mean the *entire movie* is crowded with easter eggs, little secrets, hints, symbols, double meanings that all work in the direction of a superbly executed story and film with a brilliant, terribly meaningful twist at the end. The best thing about this film is that although it's atmospheric, and very heavy/dark in color/feel and texture, something almost of a horror film, despite its definite taste for the haunting macabre it remains a totally healthy, composed watch without ever straying away from the plot or entering bizarre realm. Every single scene, and every single moment during the scenes has purpose, excellently performed and executed, and contributes to a greater end, there isn't one second too much in this masterpiece. And the main theme which it deals with, GUILT, is developed in the most subtle and outstandingly relevant way and offers great insight into human psychology. Just...just right. Really, perfect.",9,1,2,18 May 2016
The Exorcist," Extremely overrated, and completely hollow
","I went into this film with tons of hype, as everyone of later generations, but before you start thinking this is just a biased view of over-expectations gone awry; I am talking mad, 'scariest movie of all-time', 'I couldn't watch during some scenes' type hype, and it wasn't just a couple of people, it was the entire internet and a pool of varied, different people in real life. Still, I just went into this apparently quintessential horror classic of classics, which I knew had deeply influenced pop-culture and the way people look at the horror film forever, with a fair man's mindset expecting at least something solid. What we get here is the most predictable story and development, with no discernible subtlety or particularity - just the most bland version you could POSSIBLY think up reading this review right now knowing however little you know this moment. The dullest, least dynamic, flat overdose of vivid and boring obviousness in all its early 70's splendor. This film was obviously a complete hoax. It just knew it had something big: a (for the time) graphic depiction of a possessed girl, the satanic/possession theme, with a film studio trick or two (the upside down stairs gallop, the twisting head.. today, just cheap), a mixture of gross and taboo made for shock value pestilence, glorified by the morbid fascination of the bored and willing masses. I swear the 'the power of Christ compels you' scene is the longest; you might literally find yourself staring at your watch with the most jaded, defeated expression on your face. There is nothing remotely redeeming about it, no interesting development, morality, point of argument...nothing. You could basically watch a one-scene-parody of it, and that would really, actually do it justice. And that's a really, really, really bad perspective for a film, and I don't believe this is out of line at all.",3,1,6,22 May 2016
The Usual Suspects," Very good 'classic' flick, a tad overrated
","This is one of these seminal films and whether it's truly the first to accomplish its main feature, it's at least the bigger film to do it this early. A film that's had Scary Movie utilize one of its premises. A movie that influential that it's completely infiltrated the collective unconscious. A movie you'd call: 'classic'. Overall, the qualities are as follows: the acting especially from Palmintieri and Spacey, but also Byrnes and the Lord Kobayashi guy. The concept and its execution globally close to flawless. The irony behind it all, and of course the twist at the end. The flaws: there's too much talking, and the film seems like it draws towards the ending more than stands on its own, it feels like the movie-makers gave the ending so much importance they unknowingly neglected the rest of it. It's not a particularly enticing film to watch in its entirety, and it only gets interesting starting at a certain later point.",8,0,0,18 May 2016
No Country for Old Men," Extremely overrated, good first half average overall action flick
","Unfortunately in a review it is essential to talk about the movie's terribly over-exaggerated positive reception, rather than just the movie in itself. The pretentious pseudo-intellectual clique has done it again: they've taken a terribly flawed piece and because of context and strong bias (a Coens film...) they've made it out to be this timeless masterpiece. Which honestly is ridiculous. The film plays out great for about the first hour plus. The plot is very light, some major elements never explained; but we're in this thriller and our attention is commanded. Eventually, the thin plot never seems to thicken, our hopes for fulfilling symbolism/meaning or at very least answers never satisfy, the dialog is completely bland, vapid and uninteresting all the way up to the last scene which is somehow supposed to hold a powerful weight apparently. The film totally lacks rhythm overall with, again, a strong first half but it seems the entire film settles with being told in the one same breath, utterly boring and insufficient towards the second hour. We're just given event after event, with the same old tone and no depth ever supplied. Added some details about the action sequences are very unsatisfying and badly carried out, and this thriller of a film isn't even convincing from that point of view. So very remote in its entirety, so very void of any genuine purpose, and quite average if not mediocre at what it's even supposed to be. It's not even fun spanning over 2hrs, it really feels long.",5,1,7,1 June 2016
Liar Liar," Exactly what you think: and it's solid
","As my title suggests. Jim Carrey can't lie, and this is a film that showcases his many, many bizarre tricks and crafts as an absolute maniac of a unique comedian following that fun-to-start-with premise. This is one of these films that would be entirely irrelevant and painfully forced would it be just about anyone BUT that one Jim Carrey individual. It's completely silly in parts, way over-the-top, and belongs to the good thick family humor but is, somehow, still funny. Thanks Jim Carrey. The film in itself is fine, the story is alright and allows for a good morality at the end. It's cute in places, but really the focus here is Jim Carrey and the ridiculous positions this miracle of life has put him, a conniving lawyer, in to go through. If you like Jim Carrey, watch this. If you don't, you'll find it forced, unfunny and far-fetched.",7,0,1,19 May 2016
Man on the Moon," Very strong Biography starring Jim Carrey
","As the title of this review says. This is a very strongly written and directed biography about the life of Andy Kaufman, a very, very, VERY strange comedian who had the most unique sense of humor, and as you can judge yourselves by looking up some of his real life sketches online, was at very least part genius, if I can say so. Jim Carrey comes in. Possibly the best human being, if not 'the only', on the planet to play this role. It's one of these roles that are just tailor-made for a very specific individual. The film, up until the very last scene, is a tribute to Kaufman for how incredibly ahead of his time he was and the utterly unique sense of humor and creativity he possessed, completely detached from anything else that existed at the time and even for now. The film is very direct, vivid. It somewhat feels like a sequence of newspaper articles depicting Kaufman's life events put together in a coherent way. Jim Carrey is an amazing human being, and this film matches that special, unique quality he's always Carried with him (get it ? 'Carried' ?.. eh, awful...). A very nice film, and eye-opening for many who may've never heard of this contemporary genius portrayed here by another contemporary genius.",8,1,1,18 May 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Heaps of fun, great little movie
","Ralph Fiennes as always does a superb job, playing the lead role here of an eccentric hotel owner. The film is all about atmosphere and feel and it's got a very cartoony, tongue-in-cheek feel to it. The story is solid, the cast is great, and young actors like the young hotel boy and his fiancée are perfectly picked and it seems all decisions taken by the film-makers fall into place just right. It's certainly a fun ride and never lets down, taking the viewer through a myriad of various chapters in the adventure that is this somewhat outrageous bit of cinema. Some would call it 'precious', I'd say there's a bit of that in there, but overall nobody can deny the heaps of fun this represents at very least on the first viewing. Cinema doesn't always need to be profound and deeply philosophical, some films can be just great at what they do without any great symbolism or metaphor, and this is definitely one of them. You WON'T be bored watching this. Strong, catchy, excellently written/executed film.",8,0,1,18 May 2016
Insidious," Could have been the best horror movie of ALL TIME
","First off, not up to the hype. It's not as scary as people make it, no matter what you read. I was terrified by it before I actually saw it. Then I was like: really ?!...ok cool, I'm sleepin good tonight.But then, the pros and cons must be distinguished: Pros: * Incredible intro/theme. Very subtle, the perfect intro/credits ever for a horror. * Good use of the music with the momentum of the scenes. * Good ideas for the scare scenes. * A killer plot that had tremendous potential. * Excellent vision for the 'Further'. The perfect nightmare.Cons: * Borrowed or simply copy/pasted a lot from many movies before it. * Acting, direction at times, script and just feel overall too Hollywood, too unreal, too polished - actors are playing mere pre-written characters as opposed to real human beings who react to a horrible reality. * Could have been much scarier given the pieces they had to their puzzle. * Some aspects in bad taste (long haired fiend...) * A bit too unrealistic towards the end.All in all, just like Inception this film touches on subjects of astronomical potential and importance - the realms of dream, reality-meets-fiction, eternity and infinity - and fails like the latter to deliver a complete, whole picture of its monumental failed ambition.Because of the great and the good in this movie, and because of the efforts on the artistic side to make this more than just a polished, soulless Hollywood creation: I'll be generous and give it a 8/10, though a 7 could be in the discussion. But there's no way this movie earns less, and it just doesn't have what it takes to get to 9 or 10.Fully developed and less Hollywood, less commercial - this has the potential to have been the best horror movie of all time...too bad.",7,1,4,30 October 2011
22 Jump Street," Very good at what it does
","Well you may think this here is pure Hollywood formulaic comedy onanism that barely holds up a framework to merely work a quick plot, a couple of processed jokes and mix it up in the right convenient format with regards to length/acting/politics etc...And there's certainly a part of that, but this one here is actually well built and worth a watch. The management and resolution of suspense about who the bad guy really is for instance is really good, and it is as everything else in the flick: it doesn't take itself seriously, while still being well crafted.A couple of gags are a bit overcooked, and it isn't laugh out loud funny the whole time, but some moments are well worth the time ('do you like weather ?'), the secondary characters are very good, the action scenes are original and fresh and don't have that feeling of instant boredom as they only start like most action movies over the last decade, it's got very good pace and doesn't feel stretched or stale at any moment. And of course there's a good little moral woven throughout and at the end, and all in all it may beat the first.Good stuff. A deserved 7.5/10.",7,1,2,3 November 2017
The Game," Felcher's best - very underrated
","I know it's got about an 8/10 here on IMDb but its metascore is only 61, which is a ridiculous average, and overall people just never ever ever talk about this film although by my count this is a better film than Seven or Fight Club which weren't as clever or well constructed or intelligent as this one, and they get a ton more notoriety. Douglas is just superb in this one, and Penn, Unger put in very good performances as seconds too. It's a film which concept is so concise you'd think it should be made into an episode of a mystery-type series, and that it could never work out as a 2hrs+ silverscreen production, that its plot would run out of breath too soon and that it would need a bunch of exterior elements added to the plot to keep it relevant and that eventually the dynamics of it would be bent towards the middle-to-end area because the twist seems obvious etc... but none of that. None of it at all. The film is completely coherent with its tamed, nightly atmosphere. It is subtle and vows to put most technical questions about the plot the viewer may have to sleep. It's very careful and professionally handled in laying out all the premises and details necessary to making the plot possible, plausible; and til the very end, we are truly kept away from the secret. The twist is very strong, and a satisfying release of tension, with questions answered; and quite moving too. All in all, very ambitious project, and: mission accomplished. Superb piece.",8,0,0,19 May 2016
La Grande Illusion," Overrated. Flat. Unevenly structured. Not great in any one way.
","I'll start this review by stating one cannot regard a film from 1937 and gauge it the same way he would a contemporary movie. This here is the sort of film that seemed to have inspired a Stephen King for example to write the resounding classic 'the Shawshank Redemption' with certain ideas obviously picked from this pre-world world II document of a piece. So it is no doubt a pioneer, and its credit for that is due.However. As a film from any one period in time, as just being a film: its dialog is only interesting in some bits but overall quite ordinary if not flat and the film doesn't say much or carry any kind of a moral anywhere or ultimate message, if not values of honor or emphasizing that nations don't divide individuals but nothing like a grand scheme subtly knitted. The film is a succession of events chained up together to form the narrative where there are just scenes and then more scenes and a story to follow, it being rather uneven structurally in fact. It's one of those films that seem to go one way, then choose another direction and when the end seems to come there's still more to go and yet another setting to process. The escape scene is a bit ridiculous and certainly unrealistic in its concept, and there isn't much to extract from any of the main parts of the film. Some have pointed to the historical context as being cinematic artifact, but depicting two high society aristocrats one French the other German being bound by class rather than by culture is hardly an awesome achievement, we get it and it's quite commonplace for this sort of film and context - and if anything the film seems a bit biased and appears to pick a side about that class conflict apparently awarding more glitter to those two rather than the mere soldier kind, so the film feels at least a bit like it's got a political position.",5,2,4,18 January 2018
Dumb and Dumber," A True 'Pure Comedy'
","In an industry that puts out films that follow a strict guideline, that is the industry of Hollywood generally and comedies being no exception, there's a place that very few mainstream comedies can go to that feels right at home, one that doesn't take itself seriously at all, that genuinely lets loose entirely, and which spontaneous momentum isn't being contrived by rigid structure and academic rule. It's very, very dumb...but not so dumb it's just only dumb. It's dumb in a way that's efficient, and there's a very thin line between being just plain mindless random processed stupidity with no actual spirit behind the humor... and controlled chaos. This one is certainly the latter. It isn't trying hard, it isn't awkward. It's smooth and genuine, it's real, and has resonated as a cult classic because of that true genuine nature.From that very first scene with Jim Carrey at the back of the limo, to the very last bit of footage, it's pure nonstop action and gags and utter silliness with a purpose and liveliness. It never wanders into facile randomness, or never settles for riding its own self-complacency, every scene is fresh and original. Brand new. There's no time to get bored with the humor on display, it keeps coming back with a new angle, a new powerfully idiotic bang.It manages to actually tell a story, compelling on its own in fact, while being a gag reel all the way through, which is no easy feat technically.The directing, sound, and editing are superb in creating just the right conditions for the film to be resoundingly moronic and most efficient. It doesn't try hard; instead it knows exactly what it's doing.Finally: as in the title I call this a 'pure comedy', because the entire focus of the whole picture is to make people laugh, entertain wildly through the craft of comedy, while most mainstream comedies are merely 'comedies' in form but use that format in order to be a pleasant watch but really have a romantic or drama or moralistic motive and outcome in the end. Dumb and Dumber is comedy through and through, again, from that very first scene in the limo to that very last bit of film, the sole purpose is to make people laugh hard. There's no 'hidden agenda' so to speak, it's comedy for the sake of comedy, and arguably, that's all comedy should ever be. A true, 'Pure Comedy', supremely inspired, carefully written, with an excellent spirit and momentum to it, and perfectly conducted from beginning to end.",10,4,6,12 October 2018
Caddyshack," Late 70's uptight society going loose
","It's understandable this would turn out to be considered a comedy classic if you look at the fact this is one of Bill Murray's firsts, a film featuring an ever-verbose Rodney Dangerfield, a beautiful young Cindy Morgan and the then very popular Chevy Chase, and when you conjugate all that to a Golf field, what with the caddy culture, a youth meaning to have fun by all means...this was all very relevant and culturally very current.But in itself, as a comedy being watched today, we're given a little bit of plot, some pretty funny moments from time to time, but overall something of a predictable, a bit flat, over-the-top and puerile 1980 effort that will go a bit all over the place in various parts.There's some fun to be had, but it's very certainly no masterpiece.",5,0,3,4 October 2016
Paranormal Activity," Objectively...
","Cons: - a lot about it has been borrowed from other films (from specific scenes to ideas globally, to camera angles...) - takes a bit of a while to get into the flow - seems just a tad bit slow in parts - needs to be taken seriously and to be gotten into to avoid boredom, staleness and feeling like it's repetitive images and recurring footage and documentary/study oriented. So requires attention and playing along, explaining the disgruntled crowd and their criticism.Pros: - well written - not a typical idea for the presence, a rather original take on the cause of the said paranormal activity - a frightening cause - well acted, believable in deed - overall buildup on the entire picture and ending climax really quite chilling - good management of the sound - unknown well managed, well interpreted, great concealed/displayed ratio.All in all: could have been scarier. Not at all as scary as the hype suggests. Worth watching. Not a bad film at all.",7,0,1,27 October 2011
Big Fish," Poetic, helluva lot of fun, and whole
","Another brilliant Tim Burton. The story taken from a novel, and it feels like it as we're plunged through a series of wild adventures, each one pleasantly whole and meaningful and always entertaining; and while all the action is supplied during the tale-telling, another story is being told in the actual original time and setting. Like the current and anecdotal timeframes are feeding off each other to build up the momentum for a grand ending. The film is dense with a lot of elements and pans out smoothly. Not once does it feel like there's too much or that it has too many participants. The moral is very original and not apprehended, it offers quite a lot to be discussed - the ending very touching as it is the culmination of the crescendo built progressively and patiently through the entire 2hrs+. The acting is consistently very good, and Billy Crudup does a very good job playing the jaded yet still attentive son. Overall the crux of the story, a man bored with reality constantly looking to thrill it up, is one that is very weighty with realism and implications, and this is a superbly executed version of that concept. Great cinematography, great fun; just one of these films that is quite perfect at what it sets out to do. Excellent.",9,0,1,4 June 2016
The Dark Knight," It's like a really bad joke - Please Read
","Batman. Pause and think about that character for a minute.
'The Batman' is a guy in spandex bat suit going around fighting crime, a superhero character from a comic book from the 1940's for young children looking for a bit of fun and a place for their juvenile imaginations to run free. His sworn enemy is 'the Joker', a clown with clown tricks up his sleeve who's a villain.Where the earlier Tim Burton adaptations were fun and tongue in cheek, this here takes the Batman, the guy running around in spandex in a bat suit fighting off the bad guys... and makes an attempt at a disconcertingly, utterly serious film noir with an atmosphere about as dense as a horror movie, exceeding the 2hr30 mark. It's... like a joke, it's something akin to the concept for a comedy sketch one would have. To take something a bit ridiculous and light, and reverse its momentum in making it into this piece that takes itself completely seriously. It's a very common premise for many comedy sketches or concepts.The fact it was received so absurdly well by the greater public is, sadly, testament to how empty and strayed our current times are, that the common individual looks for a hero and ideals of greatness, epic drama, and meaning, in something like a 3 hour long horror movie/thriller version of Batman directed by Christopher Nolan. And this review doesn't even take into account the film from a technical perspective: too many characters, cringy silly scenes, way too long... etc",2,2,6,15 October 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Too dull, very pretentious, self-indulgent, and incomplete
","This film gets all its well established notoriety and popularity from how philosophically suggestive it is, for the questions it asked, and for its penchant for visual imagery and artistic visions.A film is only as poignant as its scenes are during the actual viewing time, not days later when thoughts are compiled together to the point of creating a layer that practically exists on its own independently from the film itself. If the film depicts something profound then it should be felt as the viewer is watching, the methods assembled to convey a thought or concept should be efficient enough for the viewer to be submerged with emotion as he's actually watching. This film settles for grazing questions, for suggesting there might be interesting things to be found here, for merely opening up drawers loaded with files without ever picking one and pointing to an interpretation. It's too vague to even be abstract in quality, it's just random. There's a sort of meaning behind it all, but no closure on any of the notions being touched on - and the worst problem is even if there were, it would be so darn CRYPTIC it would just be a ridiculously overcomplicated confusing way to achieve its goal. The film creators are in the obligation as professionals of supplying the right elements for the viewer to understand the point being made, or else, he's not really even saying anything, it's just words and phrases floating in midair.The whole concept of AI becoming sentient and taking over on its own initiative was older than this novel or film so A Space Odyssey can't be awarded the full credit for the original idea, it was merely borrowing the thought of the evil computer machine turning on its human creator, without adding any more flavor to it, and building a scene around the notion to be inserted into a mainstream production. It's well made, but that's all. The conspiracy against the two human individuals was carried out in a completely linear fashion and the protagonist's return to the ship and dismantling of HAL 9000 was just execution of the narrative.On the monolith: it's interesting in concept, and the genuinely anguishing ghost music in the background is efficient along with the ominous camera angles... but again, it's all up for interpretation of the wildest kind. Some far-fetched ridiculously cryptic explanations can be found out here on the internet, but the most sensible one for me was the monolith was simply the catalyst to human development: the person was describing how the monolith was a perfect geometrical figure with straight angles and perfectly straight lines, which would in a somewhat symbolic way inspire the apes to progress and adopt the underlying concept of precision and therefor moving forward into technological advancement (hence the tools later, so on..). Too vague a meaning anyways past the ape stage really...The film is intentionally very slow-paced which isn't a problem in itself only that the slowness is directly associated with the pompous attitude of the film: a movie that starts off with a pitch-black screen and 5 whole minutes of abstract soundtrack music, repeated later in the film, classical music used several times during scriptless scenes... the artsy fartsy psychedelic trip at the end which is really the film-makers discovering a new technology at the time and abusing its most basic functions for about 15 minutes straight.As a whole it does look absolutely great however: the space ships are very detailed in design and actually look real hovering in space, the futuristic technology and furniture and overall colors and shapes are interesting and quite pleasing aesthetically. It should be said as of this writing some 50 years after its release it really aged fantastically well and the imagined novelties of the future still don't come across as ridiculous as in most such films' visions.The ending scene is, again, poetic, thought-provoking... but doesn't cop out from the film's general ineptness at being clear and taking responsibility for saying something tangible and exact and further contributes to the pretentious attitude of this Kubrick 'masterpiece'.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Superb, 'unique' love story
","This is one of these films that you can label into genres of course, everything bears properties that allow that thing to be put into a specific box, but here what we've got is a sci-fi/drama/mystery philosophical comedy/romance that is authentic enough that it really doesn't fit completely anywhere but in a category of its own. Jim Carrey shows more of his seemingly endless range, while Winslet does a solid job, as well as the seconds, which all play an important role in the film (as opposed to just filling in).This piece does a great job providing a very strong development of its main premise, all the while nourishing/complexifying it with accessory subplots relevant to the film's story, concept and feel. Structurally and in terms of cinematography, the movie excels. And poses a philosophical question of a very unusual angle throughout its playing time, and the ending brings a fantastic conclusion to the story, while never separating from the spirit of the film. There's that feeling of unreal infinity, like an endless mirror effect, a very real and poetic nostalgia, and at the center of it, a beautiful love story with a very unique flavor. Coherent, excellently conceived and executed, 'unique' film that deserves to be seen and that can touch movie-enthusiasts of all horizons.",8,0,1,19 May 2016
Alice in Wonderland," Burton makes Alice in Wonderland and it's better than you'd initially think
","Firstly, I'm no Lewis Caroll fanboy nor a connoisseur in any quality of the original novel so this review contains nothing in relation to whether the film was true to the book and what not, it's a movie review purely about the movie: Alice in Wonderland (2010) directed by Tim Burton and starring Mia Wasikowska whom since they've been brought up both do a very efficient job in my opinion for their respective tasks: Alice is strong-willed, has lots of presence and character and that's precisely what her role is about: a free-thinker in a world of formatted prudes who's not afraid to let her imagination and peculiar personality thrive. I also think that young Australian actress fit the character physically as she was not only pleasant to look at but conveyed that strong will while not being boorish either, just that fine line: a feminine tomboy with the slightness and freshness of a young girl.And now about Burton: he does well to recycle the Alice story and keep it exciting and bring enough elements to it that it's something new to look at, rather than just being another Burton or just another Alice iteration. 
The film is structured and paced just right running in at the standard 1 hour 45min. Each scene is memorable and distinct visually, the dialog very good and punchy, often funny, and it never lets itself become self-indulgent. All the secondary characters and sprites are very well crafted - Johnny Deep as the Mad Hatter, those two plump boys, the Jabberwocky (voiced by Christopher Lee as an easter egg), both Queens are fantastic (and hilarious in their own way: Anne Hathaway and her deliberately annoying princess-like mannerisms holding out her hands like a fairy and coming close to throwing up a few times - and Bonham Carter's anger tantrums and ridiculous head), the Cheshire Cat... the tiny frog subjects of the queen and their deep voices...Stylistically the film is quite awesome: from the very cool design for the card soldiers, to generally the sometimes barren sometimes hyper-colorful and rich dreamy landscapes with that thick hard contrast filter throughout, to the way they depicted for instance the phonies with their caricatured overly large features...All in all, a job very well done. Obviously however one looks at it, it's still mostly crafted on an original story and inspired by a few earlier versions.

Sinister," 'Sinister' ? Not really...
","*NO SPOILER PART* This isn't a good horror. It starts off very well, it feels very genuine, actors are good, Hawke in particular. Unfortunately the film does what many recent horrors have done, from around 2005 onwards: they start off with a strong impression, good atmosphere, and capture the audience's attention. Eventually it's only a matter of time before its authenticity crumbles apart as the story wanders on, completely drops in intensity, predictability sets in big clichés appear, we start to lose focus and stop caring for the characters...bits and pieces copy/pasted directly from other films... ultimately, it's just a bit of a mess. There are good scares in this film though, and like I said the movie is well conducted for a good hour or so.It could/should've been a lot more 'sinister' and genuine, as this movie highly relies on the footage Hawke finds and analyzes. If you're going to go for a snuff-type, vivid horror might as well go all the way and make it really weird, borderline disturbing. It feels completely amateurish and lacks courage. In fact, it feels so underdeveloped overall it feels like a short story that's been adapted to the big screen and stretches into a full length blockbuster. It's all too fugitive, the plot hangs about, and the fundamental elements never flourish to full life and it seems yet another consumable/disposable 90min experience. *SPOILER PART* Of course, the haunted house theme this movie does touch on majorly isn't the most original, and this...: the freaking dark house the whole way. Ridiculous, turn the darn lights on !! Turn em on, turn em on !!! Oh, and Ethan Hawke really likes 'Apple'.A sympathy 6/10 because it was still quite enjoyable though and never gets putridly boring, rather than 5/10.",6,0,0,31 December 2013
Up," Very lackluster, rushed effort
","This little cartoon here settles for superficial caricature frames that it collects along the whole picture, like every theme and major point are a thick idea barely developed at all just hastily thrown in. It's incredibly formulaic.They establish how he's got this idol at the start of the film, and how his wife dies too soon and he loved her so dearly, and the little inside jokes they had between them (which is cheaply used as a recurring thing throughout the cartoon, like the obligatory repetition/emotional thing), and then there's the bad guy who's the irrational caricatured token bad guy, then the kid without parents just looking for love and companionship, then they threw in dogs because everybody loves dogs but they're not even all that funny (although some of it is okay-funny).It's way too rushed, and it's not touching at all and isn't very funny. It's mostly boring and just a little story to follow, nothing more.The two best things are the visuals and the sad main theme. Past that, it's mediocre-level.Failed cartoon, just a shell of what it means to be. Wayyyyy, way overrated.",4,3,5,7 April 2017
Groundhog Day," Comedy classic with a fulfilling meaning
","Bill Murray stars in this absolute classic of a comedy, a comedy written in a way most mainstream American comedies attempt but fail badly at: a story with lots of funny moments, and an actual morality at the end that rings true, genuine and somewhat deep. Lots and lots of funny moments in this uniquely (at the time) structured film, and whether you're a Murray fan or not, there should be enough in those scenes to make you at least partake in the fun. This movie has this sort of a contagious grip on the viewer like it's a kind of game (as Murray's day keeps on repeating on perpetual loop). A movie that's had many generations laugh out loud, and movie-makers directly inspired from it. In the madness of his 'now-daily routine', Murray seeks redemption, and isn't that endless loop perhaps a metaphor (that he wasn't doing the right thing in his daily life), and highly reminiscent of the perpetual torments in Greek mythology ? Comedy classic. Should be seen.",8,1,2,21 May 2016
Pulp Fiction," Extraordinarily overrated, but a fun watch
","This is by no means boring, but by no means 'essential' or intelligent or really worthwhile at all. It's a very fun watch, hence the 5 points out of 10 I will concede it. But yet it is void of any meaning whatsoever and benefits from a contemporary society that will erect any piece of meaningless junk into a grande piece of art solely on the basis it is 'original'. Originality on its own is no virtue. There needs to be purpose, meaning, a particular sense of coherence and overall an intelligence to it. All things this movie surely lacks. The script is quite awful and tries hard at being edgy and memorable for how random and 'original' it is. This film is constantly patted on its back for being structurally and cinematographically complex and 'original', but that never makes up for how skin-deep and hollow inside it so clearly, evidently is. Acting is good, and it's pretty diverse; a succession of little stories somewhat interlinked. A good watch for purely entertainment purposes, but nothing more. And certainly not a masterpiece.",5,6,12,18 May 2016
Detroit Rock City," Excellent, but not for everyone
","When a film is this centered around a specific 'side' (as in disco vs rock, people who like the color blue vs people who like red...), it's difficult to ask from others to be mindful about it and just get into it somehow, but I would say this film is at least funny enough that if you're into this sort of raw, dirty American comedy, say, not the same but similar to a Dumb n Dumber, then surely you ought to watch it. It's not nearly as pointless as some would say, and those who call it that are all too obviously missing the message at the end, because it is loud - and - clear. This film is just about freedom, yes that false illusion of first world, middle-class kids' freedom but real freedom still in breaking away from the routine, the order established, not because yay rebels, but because it's so much fun and all kids want to do. The rush, the exhilaration, this movie transcribes those powerful emotions so contagiously, what with the exceptionally strong soundtrack, powerful scenes, the ultimate sacrifice... this film is just beautiful cinema, and honestly I wouldn't even begin to argue for it. If you didn't like it, there's no need to even start the topic. We're just too different, and that's okay, but it's far beyond constructive discussion at that point. Pure nostalgia, and it touched kids from much later generations than the KISS era, myself included. So much adrenaline, emotion and nostalgia. An ode to those kids who didn't care for being in the cool clique, and were 'real' - and made it.",9,0,0,21 May 2016
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Tons of fun
","I'm no Guy Ritchie supporter or anything and therefor in reviewing this film I remain more objective than some might be. This here is a heavily English action-comedy, I emphasize its country of origin as some might be too foreign to its cultural tinge and should be mindful of that during its viewing. Slang, talking speed, the attitudes overall...it's definitely different, and this film wasn't made to be a polished flavorless ready-to-sell-internationally item. It's authentic, rough in places but never too much and showcases an effortless (and surprising ?) balance of humor and comedy, along with hard-hitting, raw action. Its main plot is uber simple, but that's totally fine. In fact, it makes it better. Because now the movie has its trigger and the movie-makers can focus on all the rest: the little subplots, the humor, involving other characters and parties to the core of the story, before unleashing an ultimate climax at the end that is, again, very simple, almost too simple; and yet, at the risk of sounding over-complacent, it works - fits that story and mood perfectly. No reason film shouldn't be this way from time to time. Yeah it's simple, but it's effective, lots of fun, runs so smoothly and where it isn't deep and what not, it's highly entertaining, and you can't just make 'highly entertaining' if you don't know movie making.",7,1,1,21 May 2016
The Matrix Reloaded," Cheesy, a bit amateurish, action-laden sequel to the greatest sci-fi flick ever with a few strong points
","Where The Matrix, the original, was mysterious, enticing during every moment, dark but beautiful, poetic and just oozed greatness... this one was a whole lot more ordinary, predictable from the action scenes to the dialogue (the dialogue which was quite amateurish in places) and obvious rather than subtle. Where the first one was intuitively unravelling its meaning, this one flat out explains a lot.There's way too much action. The action scenes are actually rather stylish and pleasant, but only for a while, and in this one they just linger and linger...and linger. To the point the viewer may feel a sense of detachment from the flick altogether, and the cheap techno in the background doesn't help making up for the cheesiness. It almost feels like a caricature of the first one, like a totally different team picked up the franchise and expanded it artificially. For example the high way chase scene is seemingly endless, the whole Zion part at the start is in bad taste and Morpheus' speech on the kitsch side... just the name of this sequel, 'The Matrix Reloaded', gives out that tone of being so action-heavy and announces itself as being that big blockbuster.Now there are some really good elements to it though. The movie's opening scene dramatically catches the attention of the viewer (and its resolve at the end is quite interesting). The Merovingian played by Frenchman Lambert Wilson is a great character and the scenes involving him are a treat. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith continues to be awesome to watch as he brings that strangely ironic/facetious presence to the screen. And the architect scene towards the end is surely a bit too pompous in a sense yet not devoid of substance and a lot of the lines he delivers are Matrix-worthy in quality.6.5/10.",6,0,0,27 May 2019
Mystic River," Not quite there
","This Clint Eastwood directed crime-drama attempts something, which it does not ultimately deliver in the end. There's great tension, good acting, lots of plot action at work, but in the end that amazing twist, that release of all the tension we were looking for watching for about 2hrs20min just doesn't happen, and we get an ending and resolution that tries to mend the pieces together and just doesn't seem to even agree with itself, like it's the film that's disappointed at itself and the viewer along with it. It's just not convincing enough when you take into account the weight and expectations of the whole film. Some premises are left with an un-quenched thirst for more, like the shackles don't come off right enough at the end. It's still a very solid film starring excellent actors Bacon, Robbins, and the whole supporting cast is made of great actors who play their part very well. Cinematography's good. But in terms of story and especially that ending, there's just not enough to call this a great movie by any stretch.",7,2,3,18 May 2016
It's a Wonderful Life," Beautiful, timeless, heartfelt classic
","I've no great culture of the movies of that time, but I'm sure I appreciated it just as much as the next person did during 1946 when this came out. This is a timeless, beautiful film that touches the heart in a way rare for any kind of cinematic production. Everything is perfectly constructed, thought out and executed - from the the very first scene and buildup to the ending, an emotinal climax in intensity and emotion I've almost never felt in any other piece. This is what I would call a 'perfect film', in that it accomplishes everything it sets out to do, and what it sets out to do is of the utmost ambition. This is, in every little detail, a magnificent masterpiece, like a modern tale that never leaves you. From its criticism of the evil ways of greedy men, its depiction of the little guy against the oppressing giant theme, the importance of the individual and the sacred nature of life, Donna Reed's natural, authentic beauty in this film... this is precious, precious cinema like it seldom ever exists.",10,1,3,18 May 2016
A Beautiful Mind," Highly overrated
","This film gets tremendous amounts of credit for being very real, and for Russel Crowe's supposed brilliant performance as the lead. I say these people are missing a few things. First of all, Crowe's role may not have been easy, but he certainly isn't masterful at it and is often either over-the-top or just not entirely credible and never seems completely 'in' the film like some actors can make you forget they are paid actors with lives outside a film. Another thing is the film is very much a plain account, a mere biography, of some brilliant mathematician who had to struggle with severe schizophrenia. Nothing earth-shaking and not much to work with besides retelling the story, this film deals a lot with just events rather than a cinematographic interpretation of those events, and the parts that are indeed rendered movie magic are over-celebrated, emotionally void and subtlety-deprived moments that engage the audience forcefully with overdramatic music and classic thick cinematic methods rather than through a strength built through heart and genuine emotion. This film painfully lacks heart and an authentic atmosphere. It is just a mechanically carried out drama affair that collects gratuitous amounts of credit, it doesn't deserve. Hollywood in the works, industrially produced, executed and sold. No art or personal touch found here.",6,1,4,18 May 2016
Die Hard," Die Hard
","Yup. That's the title I'm giving this short review. Nothing else comes to mind that would do it more justice. The time is 1988, a young Bruce Willis stars as Officer John McClane in an excellently built, explosive late 80's action classic that actually runs at about 2hrs10min but is a blast to watch. It's not perfect. It's got its flaws. But to hell with those, this is just too much fun to not be watched, and even if you're the intellectual kind, if you like cinema, check this out as it is a lesson on how to make a campy, action-filled thriller the right way. It's a bit long, and yeah the relationship with the black cop is a bit rushed during the ending scene... but the cunning intelligent villain is here, vs the anti-hero, guns, big explosions, the cops, the mischievous lines Willis delivers...this is fun man. It's no masterpiece but it's just fun. Just pick it up and, have fun. It's all this is, although it takes real knowledge to do it well and smooth.",7,4,5,20 May 2016
Psycho," Top, top cinema
","This is one of the best horror films you'll watch in your life, and no this review is not just another band-wagon follower. This movie isn't overrated and its reputation isn't exaggerated. It truly is excellence if you've ever seen it on the silver screen. The utilization of the protagonists is unique and makes for a standout dynamic in this film, while at the end the twist is truly completely unexpected. And I'm saying this now at a time when we've seen it all in every possible way, so at the time this was just light-years ahead of its cinematic period all things considered. All actors play their part just fine and help establish at each moment, along with the excellent cinematography (all in subtlety and allusion) and soundtrack, a particular feel, or a specific lingering emotion. It's really very well done, and some parts are just spot-on like it is rare in film. But Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates just steals the show here amongst the cast. In this film, there is an unsettling weirdness that oozes out of him, and it is never overdone, nor is it ever unremarkable. It's just...just right. Moreover, the plot revolves around a fairly common, and very real occurrence: the Oedipus complex. And it's so well carried out throughout the film, and never gives in to over-exaggeration although it would remain of course a very extreme case. But never does this turn into overdramatic cheesy 60's horror cinema, and the tensions are handled perfectly, as always with Hitchcock, cleverly and meticulously. The only criticism I would give this is the too obvious explanation at the end and overall that ultimate elaboration scene just isn't realistic, in regards to a few things. Finally, the very last scene with Norman Bates' inner-monologue, and the way Perkins acts it out, and that smile. Just ...perfect.",9,0,1,30 May 2016
To Kill a Mockingbird," Pretty average white guilt apologetic piece of cinema
","It's a good film in that it's got content, that is well executed, by strong acting throughout, and a good moral at the center of it.It's overrated in that it's really not a brilliant film but was one of the first big films that put the oppression of the American black man in the foreground of the plot, with a very strong emphasis on the injustice of racial discrimination. Most of the film's strength, the thing most people will remember, is that scene at the trial of the black worker. But there isn't in fact anything cinematically exceptional about that scene, or anything else here for that matter.It's slightly untidy as well, and a bit disjointed. As the film starts it seems we'll the protagonists will be the group of children which we closely follow the adventures of, until a drastic change in atmosphere occurs as we're plunged right into the trial's guts; and it seems the momentum built in one area of the film goes silent for a new one to take rise, and so on; the dynamics are on alternative current. Just take the film's very title and tagline: 'to kill a mocking bird'. It isn't obvious until the very last scene, an ambiguous ending really, where it seems the film loses a lot of what it's setting out to do in the first place.",6,1,3,28 December 2016
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A fine film that ends on a perhaps too difficult note
","This here is quite a classic film. Nicholson does a great job as the nutty but ultimately sane protagonist, while every other actor/actress plays his specifically written role very well. Notably, Louise Fletcher as the lead nurse. The film does a very good job globally at not dwelling on its main concept and introducing a variety of derivative subplots that all help build the momentum up til the ending. The characters are all well developed, the scenes express their point vividly, there are surprises as it goes and not one dull moment despite the very focused plot at work.I don't do this often in my reviews, but I will give a more personalized opinion: the ending, although necessary to deliver the film's strong conclusion, is perhaps a bit too harsh, like they didn't have to go quite that way and could've found something else. It feels just a little bit *too much* I'd say.",8,1,2,19 July 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Some fun to be had
","This picture got a tremendous sort of cult following because of its peculiar dry humor. It's a kind of humor that means to be very virile and 'classy'. The Anchorman is basically the official license for boys to be boys: look sharp, show off, be competitive in the silliest of ways, be all-out macho and consider what they're doing to be the only and best way.So they got the whole gang here: Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Koechner, Vince Vaughn... and quite a few cameos throughout the picture (nothing particularly funny, just wacky cameos)... and pushed big name star power with a clear-but-simple game plan, and along the way a few memorable quotable passages and jokes.None of the characters are particularly remarkable or funny and they easily could've made Carell's character for example funnier, but the point is to play ball and be silly with it, so at that it's some fun to be had. It's not particularly stale after a while but it isn't quite a fascinating watch: they did well enough to hold it all up together while slipping in scenes they apparently had intended to use anyways ('Afternoon Delight', the major brawl with all the cameos, or some of the anchorman in-studio prank stuff).Side-note: the fact this got such a strong cult following if anything is sad, because it really only is just another Hollywood comedy with the usual big name gang with a theme, a plot, and a few jokes to be remembered. But people quote this like it's a major classic, use characters' portraits as avatars or signatures on websites and forums... like the film was some kind of a classic when it's so much more benign really !6.5/10.",6,0,0,17 May 2018
Stranger Than Fiction," Strong throughout
","The first remark that comes to mind when thinking of this film is it's good from the very start...to the end ! So many in fact a vast, vast majority of Hollywood mainstream films that do well at being engaging at first will only throw out an entertaining idea to be entertained by its audience for a while, before that idea is exhausted and the experience wears very thin. Here, it holds up til the end, and the conclusion isn't a rushed potato salad that contrasts hard in quality with the earlier developments and hopes of the movie.Some have saluted Ferrel's 'excellent acting', while others have condemned it saying this role was stripping him of his natural charm that people watch him for in the first place. You must agree at least a bit with the first view. He does superbly well at being a hybrid, a lead character torn between being a mere fictional hero of some narrated story and an actual individual with feelings and opinions and emotions. He conveys that very well.Emma Thompson pretty good also.There are lots of symbols in this film, about the daily life... about just life. The importance of it. It gives an interesting perspective on it. And it does really well to be ambiguous with the two levels it works on but coherent all the same and manage to actually come up with a strong resolve out of that awkward mingling.One of the rare films of its kind to deliver from A to Z. Well done. Certainly more than a mere amusing Hollywood comedy.",8,1,1,2 May 2017
Jaws," Completely manufactured Hollywood film with monster shark and big name actors thrown in
","This film constantly gets copious amounts of praise for how well directed and well managed it was. Granted the Jaws theme John Williams composed has remained a classic in film score and depicted with aplomb the anxiety and terror of a large predatory shark closing in, and the scenes are decently directed and put together if you assess them with conventional mainstream movie criteria... but this is so far removed from actual shark phobia in any realistic, poignant sort of way and is so completely disinterested with it aside from the very first scene (possibly the only really creepy moment). It never even attempts to be realistic or genuine and only settles for that big production plastic Hollywood atmosphere and basically self-imposed itself as the one good shark movie out there that was legit (all other attempts being cheap B rated rubbish). It had John Williams for the score, Spielberg behind the cams, and Scheider/Robert Shaw and Dreyfuss, all well established big names, to give it the outside credibility it really is all about in the end. And 'Jaws' was even a novel, so they already had their story written for them.Instead of looking to develop psychological triggers of thalassophobia (fear of the ocean), perhaps kenophobia (fear of immense empty spaces), or actual fear of sharks, where they could've shown a lot more footage of the deep dark endless ocean and managed the suspense up to a climax there, built tension of a lurking sea monster which looming presence is felt like its terrifying appearance is imminent, played around between the ominous utter silence of the ocean blue and filled up that silence with a sudden change of pace and horrifying panic... basically instead of doing their job at that with this being the supposed top notch 'fear of the ocean/featuring a great white shark' masterpiece, they settle for the bare minimum in terms of exploring the phobia itself and just go for processing a bland screenplay and script and scenes that are about as superficial and deep as the entrance of a beach.",4,2,8,15 October 2018
Kingpin," Pretty classic 90's Comedy by the Farrelly bros
","More than anything, this film has that presence, that spirit about it that lots of 90's comedies had and Farrelly films in particular. The jokes are very silly but actually efficient, and help constitute a cartoonish kind of setting for the main characters. The humor turns a little extreme in parts, a bit too silly on occasion but mostly it's this coherent atmosphere of 'life is crap but let's keep trying to go forward, who knows seems there's a chance or whatever' just like Dumb n Dumber was for e.g.This style makes for a fun, entertaining viewing all the way as the plot keeps bumping into new elements with new events, new characters or returning characters. The story is quite well knitted together in that.Lots to say about it really, but it's funny, well constructed, well casted and well concluded enough that it's one of those rare actually good through and through comedies. You're in for the laughs for one, but also the story, and one really is intrigued til the very end about how this whole thing unwinds.",8,0,2,8 September 2016

Calling it 'perfect in every way' makes one just seem like a biased fanboy bereft of any objectivity, but really, on a number of levels, everything you will come to expect of brilliant, masterful cinema, you will find here. Its cinematography, plain but efficient; its length, just right, not one scene too long or too many. The acting, superb all-round, and the characters as vivid and efficient/relevant to the story as possible. The tension in the film: just right. We're always given compelling events to deal with, some rough and tragic, that just deepen the film more and more, while creating subplots and rejuvenating the story with newer elements, but while never straying away from the whole point of the film, which is, ladies and gentlemen, so touching and unique I'd have great difficulty to find a climax as beautifully directed, imagined and executed, and as magically cultivated scene after scene, until this utmost emotional eruption. The dialog, Freeman's narration, the complexity on so many levels and the layers of the plot, the theme of good vs evil, of never giving up, the thirst for justice, the intelligence manifested through the main character... This film is so beautiful, and masterful...it's quite possible, I'd have to admit...it's quite possibly the greatest film of all-time. 10/10 most certainly.",9,0,0,20 May 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Highly insufficient
","People are easily impressionable. All you need to do sometimes is come up with lots of flash, even if the substance doesn't follow. The cast is good, and seeing Keaton again, a quite particular actor, playing a lead role in a major production is very endearing. Emma Stone plays very well, surprisingly. The cast is globally strong, with Norton and Watts, two very good actors, as mere seconds here. Technically, the cinematography is very detailed and constantly sought after, and unfortunately that's where all the people fall into the obvious trap. The film has substance, but not a whole lot, not anything that hasn't been done a bunch of times before, and although it makes for a good viewing, the absence of a strong morality or even conclusion at all sinks this one. It's a fine, eventful movie, but it's not even close to masterpiece territory like lots are implying or outright saying. And the ending tries hard to be poetically abstract but really doesn't mean much (AND is taken from another film).",5,2,3,17 May 2016
Prometheus," Strong initiation to a potentially GREAT trilogy
","First of all, this isn't nearly as bad as they make it in reviews. We should take a film for what it is and judge it accordingly. So forget the pompous critiques.As a philosophy enthusiast, knowing Ridley Scott would team up with Lindelof (co-writer for Lost) along with great actors like Fassbender, Pierce and co...; that this would be a sci-fi take on existentialism through the great Alien franchise: I'd have expected a lot more dialog, interesting axioms about life, and long, profound tirades on the human condition. To address that: this is a very good event-based action movie, with underlying, hidden symbolism in stead. The soundtrack, though being a composer, I can't even recall. Typical Hollywood dramatic stuff. The actors, though the level overall is fine, again follow the typical huge production formulas. Sometimes over-the-top and unnecessary, but really just generic mostly. The exception: Fassbender is fantastic, as usual, as the cold android.Now, about the event-based aspect of this thriller, on one hand it's very beneficial for the film. As opposed to 'Inception' for e.g., where all the concepts are explained as if it were a DVD extra about the film; here the action takes place in a solidly crafted, and flawless quite honestly (despite the 2hrs, never gratuitous or wasteful) frame; and then it's up to us to pick up on the implied/concealed symbolism and meanings. On the other hand, with a title like 'Prometheus' (awakening epic echoes of Greek mythology), we may all have been waiting for more literature, but we'll learn to accept this in time when the answers come in the sequels and we have more hindsight for this one.The atmosphere: quite generic, yet fitting. They really didn't go for anything too art-oriented, even though the more conceptual side of the film (the xenomorphic features on the walls and ceiling; the virtual touchscreen when Fassbender examines the room; the goo-oozing poles) does give it a big plus. But while everybody emphasizes that it's all visual-based, it really is rather FANTASTIC CGI and the 3D glasses that do the trick as opposed to something like Avatar or such aesthetic-laden pieces. And furthermore, this film does a really good job at making the viewer feel like it's all real. There's nothing too theatrical or play-like, it's sci-fi and means to be realistic. For eg. the focal male character (the boyfriend) dies off really fast in the development of the story. We follow the main chick throughout her adventure and suffering, and nothing made her invincible during that span; she was just courageous enough to make it out alive. Even the space jockeys/engineers act very real-life like (we would imagine).All in all, this film is a very promising start to what we hope will be one of the greatest ever sci-fi trilogies made; it raises questions about mankind as it is, through a very originally constructed host of science fiction and tale-telling. On its own, as if isolated from any following sequel, this film is great at being profoundly mysterious and asks one specific question that is possibly the most thought-provoking in all that sci-fi and philosophy can blend to produce: why do our own creators want us...dead ? Despite the genius of our species, and the value of life for such conscious, intelligent, loving beings: why are we obsolete or perhaps threatening to our own engineers ? And, of course: who is Prometheus, and how will the writers integrate that concept intelligently enough into the legendary Alien franchise ?",8,4,7,9 June 2012
Halloween," The most over-hyped, over-rated piece of crap in horror. Really.
","* Yes it started slashers - not nearly the finest field in the horror genre - but it was dubbed the godfather of slashers nonetheless. * Yes, it's John Carpenter. ------------------------------------------- But that's - about - it folks. Wanna read the reality about it ? Here goes:The premise itself could not be simpler - a kid kills his sister and goes to a mental hospital, manages to escape of course a decade later... somehow (nothing about that). He manages to find and wear his trademark mask, comes to possess incredible physical strength, and haunts one girl in particular for absolutely no given reason. Behold: Michael Myers...The villain: one of the most inexplicably notorious in all of horror today, has as much depth as a post-it. There's no credibility in some 10yo killing his sister like that. And he's just out to kill...randomly. The only attribute to his account as a great killer in horror films is his heavy breathing. They didn't exploit the severe, extreme span of his unique psychological case one bit. Just the standard knife, the breathing...and a generic white mask. They turned a dreadful nightmare of a psychological case into a Tom n Jerry episode. Great.The protagonist and other preys: Jamie Lee Curtis is fine. Nothing to say here. But the rest are completely interchangeable, colorless characters that are 'developed' for over an HOUR with no murder taking place - you would think to space out, deepen and strengthen our relationship as viewers with them - but it's all just teen-girl gossip ! Nobody gives a damn about any of them. They're all skin-deep cattle.Who goes to a horror film, a genre viewed and developed by a majority of guys, whether it's 1978 or 2011, to watch scene after scene of potential slaughter trivialized by girl-to-girl teenage gossip ? And what, the final scene with Myers out to kill the main chick is supposed to redeem the whole of this crap ? He dies like 5 times in 15 minutes !The main theme, composed by director Carpenter himself, is thrown at you about 6 times during the film. The scenes that had potential to scare were completely ruined by bad timing, too-slow a pace, inadequate music, cheesiest of sound effects, terrible acting, too long of scenes...(think nun in car early in the film, or later chick strangled in car in garage) - the latter example simply turning on the ridiculous, simply. There's nothing remotely subtle about the entire 1h40min of it. Nothing interesting. Nothing subjective. It's like a horror fabricated from a computer. Neutral, cold, boring. And all in all, though I'm very willing and patient and tolerant and I wanted to enjoy it, it's awfully boring. Just...plain boring. There's no way to possibly, actually get into it in all seriousness. Fairly, this movie is just BAD. Yes.",3,15,34,29 October 2011
Despicable Me," Fine
","This sort of production needs a few things to be proper at all, and this here does tick those boxes fairly decently enough.It's for kids and therefor ultimately it needs some form of moral that develops through the whole film, something you can see building and follow and finally come to a successful conclusion. It's well emphasized from the very title, to particular scenes, that the main character is terribly selfish so this is more of how he finds love through others, love he himself never received as a child from his parents, so that's well emphasized and well made, and important for children to assimilate at a young age. And it's done with emotion and sentiment here as to be more effective and long-lasting.Another thing needed is a fun authentic universe of some sort: the minions introduced here in this one, along with the particular awfully caricatured character designs, so that box can be ticked as well.Another thing would be humor. Obviously, this has a moral and everything but isn't a documentary. Voice actors like Steve Carell or Segel aren't picked for anything but to be amusing comedians, which they are, and so the jokes have to be there. The humor is fine, some of it is really funny but it's rare and most of it is pretty standard for this sort of thing.Overall, one wouldn't call it rushed so much as it is very formulaic. You wouldn't imagine it would take all that much to produce such a story and characters, but eh, it's alright and it's got some substance and material to it.6.5/10",7,0,0,30 March 2017
Blade Runner," Aesthetically powerful, slow philosophical Sci-Fi
","This film imposes a difficult exercise for the critic. On one hand, it depicts powerful concepts, but on the other hand as a film lacks quite a bit in terms of pace and content. So basically put, its narrative is greater than its own self. The film is a much, much lesser effort than the themes it depicts.Young Harrison Ford does alright, while Hauer (the villain) is decent as well but so much of this film is in the things it hints at rather than the things it actually actively does. Just Hauer himself is more a compelling character on an aesthetic level really.The scenery is superb in places, really very impressive stuff visually for a 1982 production. But as so often with Ridley Scott sci-fi's, we're given a lot of arty stuff, of the rarest more sophisticated kind, along with very deep philosophical themes... but his films seem to always have that discrepancy in pacing and in actually developing those themes. This film borders on the genius in what it scratches on, but never achieves that genius because of how linear the scenes are, how excessively paced down the development occurs, and simply, how much the film focuses on all other things but those philosophical themes.If you'd catch that film at any random point and watch on, you'd never think it was anything more than one of those hot crime type scifi's from the 80's. It's only towards the end we're revealed all the depth that was supposedly hiding in this work. But it's too late by then. A film with such conceptual density needs to, while still maintaining subtlety in execution, make it clear what it's about. Instead, we're really given a succession of scenes with little actual value in themselves: a common, linear body of sequences with ordinary, underwhelming events happening. The fight scenes are long and often in bad taste, most scenes are in themselves totally forgettable, and what really is praised in this one is the narrative and philosophical implications from the very end, so not the film itself but what it talks about.So that's watching a full two hours of very ordinary, highly paced sci-fi, for just the one powerful scene at the end with the big quotes and all the poetry. It's totally underwhelming in light of what's put in the works. An artisan/craftsman needs to make his works shine and highlight its most precious qualities, not conceal or smother them while other aspects completely dominate the equation.As trivia, this is a film that's influenced the band Fear Factory enormously, the band quoting many moments like: 'I want more life - it's too bad she won't live... but then again who does - that's what it is to be slaved'... and one must pay tribute to the use of the then very modern synth-based atmospheric soundtrack and how it mixes so well with the blueish/metallic overtone on the visuals, with the rain at the end and that poetic, genuinely deep moment. 'Our memories, like tears in the rain'.As an ultimate philosophical ideal, this film is profoundly nihilistic. It's clearly saying man and machine are virtually the same thing so long as they are merely as intelligent, so long as they are sentient beings with memories. So no place for the soul, or a god. Organic=artificial, and there's no profound meaning to life.The other thing is this film has an interesting twist, but again, does little in the way of clarity there.A sympathy 7/10.",7,2,3,15 February 2017
Bruce Almighty," Good comedy about God and love
","Jim Carrey meets Morgan Freeman, God, and gets to take on his responsibilities for a while. Jim Carrey gets to be God, and we get to watch that on the big screen. Only with great power, comes great responsibility, that old chorus, and quickly Carrey discovers the burden of it all. He quickly walks up the social ladder and forgets the things that are more important in life, more important to him. This film is about opportunity, and living in the present moment, being there and standing strong before the things we love dissolve out of our own fingers, and no quick fix can bypass our own effort. Along the way there are good laughs, we all remember that scene with Steve Carrell being out of control with his speech as the anchorman, and Carrey delivers the goods as he always does. Morgan Freeman, superb as God. Very believable. It's a well made little mainstream comedy with a few points, and good ones; that lets itself watched. And for a plot and concept this 'predictable', this film does quite a good job.",8,0,1,20 May 2016
Identity," Very well paced, but loses suspense a bit fast
","This sort of film is quite difficult to accomplish because it needs to be seamless between the events and actions taking place, and the theory behind them. The film makers have to be extremely careful not to give away too much, too early in the film, and they also have to make sure the film doesn't come across as one big explanation of itself (à la Inception). The introduction is poignant and catches the viewer's attention quite immediately. That momentum rides into the whole bulk of the film but then it turns slightly flat. Eventually we realize that 'flat' area is essential to the very point and understanding of the film, and that's when we get into the crux of the plot. The movie starts to explain itself, and that happens a little fast in the film which makes it, not so much predictable (because it's not) but rather switches off the intensity and genuine sense of mystery that had been maintained so far. It's almost like film and viewer partner up together to see the story progress logically. The ending is interesting and offers yet another twist to the story and avoids a disappointing final impression and it's making a genuine statement rather than just trying to be a dramatic ending with no meaning, as often in this sort of twisty tale.The film probably suffers from a bit of herky jerky laying out of the plot, which interrupts the suspense before sparking it again some more, and would've benefited perhaps from a different setup.The setting and casting are good, the acting is good (from all, but Cusack in particular) and visually the film is rather memorable. I would give this about 7/10.",7,0,0,8 October 2018
Amélie," Precious and hollow, although pretty good for its style
","The pros:
<ul><li>it's cute and fresh and ultimately achieves what it means to achieve. Audrey Tautou fulfills her role just right as the pathologically introverted and naive young lady who longs for contact and love.</li><li>it pays close attention to detail and looks to establish a tight proximity with the viewer with very realistic details of the daily life, subtle observations and depictions of how people act and react (say, that guy in the restaurant with his recorder and unusually blunt remarks about the people surrounding him) </li></ul>The cons:
<ul><li>ultimately it's too hollow. It's a film that's pretty much based on nothing real and settles for being pure fantasy too overtly. It sets out to conduct a purely romantic plot that is, in the end, more fiction than anything, which is disappointing when it clearly looks to carry a certain realism about itself. There's no moral at all conveyed through the whole story, if not 'seize the opportunity' but that's hardly worth 2 hours.</li><li>it's too Manichean (there are only beautiful angels and horrible demons) and caricatured, for instance Jamel Debbouze's character vs his boss in the film who's a monster. It's too easy to set up your development when you've got such polarity in the characters, there's little worth to such a paradigm of exaggeratedly sweet and exaggeratedly evil individuals.</li><li>there's a very pernicious meanness about the film: Amélie's way of dealing with the fruit seller is just vengeful, and mean, she fights evil with evil of her own when she's supposed to set the example as the lovable protagonist.</li></ul>6/10.",6,2,4,14 February 2018
Rear Window," Strong Hitchcock, as usual
","This here is a strong Hitchcock film with Stewart playing the lead role of a newly handicapped man haunted by boredom who seeks a bit of entertainment while he's stranded in his little apartment unable to walk; but in a deeper aspect, seeks a certain quality out of his lady, here the beautiful Grace Kelly, whom he judges is too 'ordinary'. The film is well executed, the story well developed and the climax of the events leads to a climax in the emotional department at the same time, like a catharsis for the characters. Not easy to make a film based on such a simple premise, and yet, Hitchcock does it again. The film never gets complacent and seeks to constantly bring just enough to justify its playing time, while not going overboard or derailing from the plot, something mediocre films tend to do when the plot is this simple and they need to inject a dynamic into the events. A film with purpose that doesn't just tell an intriguing suspenseful story. Another solid Hitchcock.",7,0,1,18 May 2016
The Truman Show," Watch this film, whoever you are
","Jim Carrey stars in The Truman Show as he plays the main character, a guy who discovers his entire life is actually the object of a most successful and universal TV series. The metaphor is very, very potent in this one. So much goes into criticizing our current publicity/promotion oriented society, governed and determined by money, where man is turned into either a slave (Carrey) or a machine. This film is a big, big eye-opener on what free-will has become in our societies, free-will which we supposedly have more of now than ever before in our history. This film is quite subtle, pays attention to detail well enough, and delivers an incredible metaphor that seems too great for anyone to miss out on. Just one of these main, essential ideas that should've been made before but wasn't, and now this is it right here, and you have to watch it. Oh and although it makes for a great watch, a very entertaining, eventful, catchy watch - the ending is clearly a level above the whole thing.",9,0,0,18 May 2016
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Fun concept. Fun watch
","The two characters really are endearing and the concept is fun, more than this is a great comedy at all. On its own, the film is mediocre and very limited in content. But the concept and the two main idiot characters are carried out well enough that an hour and a half of this makes for a fun ride nonetheless. Some gags are fun, others actually funny, and others yet are more of the ordinary stuff we're all now used to witnessing in such commercial mainstream comedies.Overall the concept and the Bill and Ted characters were good enough to make this a really good, maybe great comedy - but the filmmakers didn't bother and rather went with an effort-economic solution of developing very slightly, just enough to make it a sellable product.Elements like 'Hey Missy...I mean, mom !...' or the pretty hilarious vocabulary of our two protagonist idiots, their likable idiocy and stupid remarks, the time travel idea with the booth and the Rufus character, the 'princesses'... all that was really good comedy material, but as a film, there just isn't enough.A generous, partly nostalgic 6.5/10.",7,0,0,9 September 2016
The Matrix," The single BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME...
","How could anyone claim that for any movie ? How pretentious am I to impose this premise ? Everybody's different, so no one movie could ever be the goat...uhhhhh...wrong, but at least consider this:<ul><li>Such a profound and multi-faceted metaphor about Life, existence. </li></ul><ul><li>Script, acting, settings, scene transition and sequencing, music are simply paradigmatic for this style of dark, cyberpunk epic and cinema in general.</li></ul><ul><li>Crescendos/build-ups are chilling to the bone, fighting/acting scenes unique (not only is this film ahead of all others conceptually, but it is also supremely brilliant visually - bullet time, a huge cinematic technical innovation) + superb camera angles.</li></ul><ul><li>Classic myths/ideologies/religious transfiguration/philosophy:</li></ul>Man vs Machine; a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; Plato's cavern allegory; Kant's phenomenon/noumenon (things as we see them/things as they are); Jesus Christ and his super-human abilities/prophetic fulfillment- myth and concept of the Oracle, Resurrection and salutatory function; Judas, Betrayer; the Choice (blue and red pill scene); Man mechanizing (think Neo's metamorphosis and holes); and the magnificent 'Sleeping Beauty' theme, when in all hope fading, Love and Destiny collide and bring the One to the Matrix.

Heat," A watchable crime with De Niro and Pacino
","'Heat' is one of these films that tried hard at being an epic. It's pretentiously long running just under THREE HOURS, and is really nothing, and I do mean nothing more than another fine action-crime drama type film that depicts the innerworkings of gangsters with their plans for heists, vs the good guy coppers. It tries hard to produce a stage for De Niro vs Pacino, the evilly motivated but likable scum vs the very flawed but ultimately good guy, and of course they meet before the climactic ending and share and manifest a mutual respect for each other, how of course they are not so different in the end, that old chorus... but although, again, this film lets itself watched, even despite the very lengthy runtime, it's too much a caricature of what it sets out to do with very little intelligence in subtly, originality or reinvention at all. The women/family of the protagonists are just filler to add more matter to the plot and runtime, and although they highlight aspects of the main lead characters' personalities they are just as ordinary and unspecial as them, and the entire film.

What We Do in the Shadows," Pretty darn good The Office meets Vampires
","I think it's all there in the title. Lots of people are going way overboard with overwhelmed appreciation, most likely they didn't expect this to be any good really and got surprised, so this is definitely not a masterpiece but it's really very solid throughout.I've heard the criticism 'lack of plot'. This is clearly one of the strong points, if anything, of the film. There's lots of content, but not much story at all, so the film does superbly well at pace, and one thing it definitely nails which was tough was not being boring about an hour in. Lots of films are funny as a narrative written down on paper, and lots of fun during the first half an hour, but then becomes immensely silly and untenable as a full length film. This doesn't do that. At all. At no point does one feel he just 'gets it' and wants to move on to something else, it keeps it funny and interesting til the end.Humor wise, it's actually pretty funny. It avoids being the graphic horror kind, you can actually laugh if you don't like horror at all so it's not being self-indulgent or a generic homer (or a cultural homer, people completely uninitiated to Oceanic/kiwi culture, who just speak English, can get it just fine).The characters are good, and pretty darn well acted out. You'd really think the actors were East-European, but none of that.Funniest scene for me was the cops under the spell inspecting the premises.One last thing: in many specific places, with particular quotes or in general as a global metaphor, the film does well, subtly, at recognizing and establishing this world of vampires and werewolves etc...isn't all that different from the world of us humans in many respects.7.5 or sympathy 8/10.",8,1,3,22 February 2017

Really, it's a funny flick with some very funny moments, others way over the top that are only just bearable if you really try hard to be a good public, but on its own is quite self-indulgent. This is the inside humor of a bunch of guys who love to make sketches, and they make a movie. Hopefully, you're on their side and get the humor either from a cultural pov (you are British/Irish) or you fancy it because it's such an 'essential' comedy that sticks out.

Moon," Interesting philosophical implications, boring film
","Movie quality isn't measured by how great its narrative is, but how well paced and captivating it is as a film, that is in a more three-dimensional way than a book. It's a nearly two-hour investment, and requires to be fully engaging.A film that is truly great will be entertaining to watch, all the while delivering the metaphors and symbolic meaning and all the subtext good stuff, and a film that is truly great will make for a great second possibly third or more viewing.This here makes an interesting first viewing, but there isn't more to it and if anything it takes up too much time to deliver its message, however thought-provoking it might be.It's very slow to start, and although interesting things are to follow, it never quite picks up in intensity and remains very seriously introspective and lowkey linear.Good premise, thought-provoking philosophical implications, but not a great film.6.5/10.",6,1,2,24 January 2019

It's got some good in it, and the efforts to produce something so genre-bending and original should be saluted in itself. There's also some pretty funny humor going on, a very sarcastic sense of caricature of many things and types of people. But overall this is common social commentary, an overly complicated plot that introduces too many things and fails in the end to convincingly resolve the tension of any of those things, and it just keeps going and going and the answers never actually come. Lots of elements are flat out left unanswered, things like they'll develop a character who seems to have purpose but then that character never shows that purpose. Ultimately very disappointing when your attention has been commanded for such a long period of time. And the whole definition interludes, it's just not a viable option to include so much written theory behind a single motion picture, a series perhaps but not a single flick. Too much, just way too much. Movie-makers should've spent less time including different angles and more time answering fewer.This just isn't a very good film, but it's certainly got good elements to it.",5,1,1,21 July 2016

De Niro is okay but widely anonymous. Liotta overplays a bit. Pesci's character is embarrassing (I know it's a biography, but still).It's interesting really because it shows all people want is mafia violence, they just like to watch the event of homicide, doesn't matter how/where/who/when... It's looooooooooooong. It never ends. And it's so incredibly irrelevant. I tried to see the good about it. Nahh....nah this is just garbage. And of course Scorsese picks the easy way out choosing to make this: just pick a mobster's real life story, put 3 renowned actors, write a dull screenplay, and film it. Everybody will love it: it's got De Niro, violence, mafia atmosphere, and the name Scorsese. This is just disgustingly bad taste.",3,8,22,31 March 2016
The Birds," Overrated, ambiguously structured, easy Hitchcock
","This is a great opportunity to state that Hitchcock was really more of a great/legendary businessman than he was a great director. He never wrote any of the films he worked on, but knew how to spot and exploit a story with cinematic potential. There isn't so much an artistic style to his films as there is a know-how stamp or signature.This here is yet another Hitchcock film, one more down the conveyor belt of prolific industrial mainstream production.We're given a long narrative in the first part between basically one man and a woman, with the typical bit of mystery that always starts off the Hitchcock films. This would all turn out to be quite vain when we understand what the film really is about: exactly what the title suggests. It seems wasteful to have spent that much time developing so much story and intrigue in human relationship so far-removed from what this film ultimately becomes, and is as a horror concept.There isn't an interesting thought or a subtle reason behind the strange happenings and every scene is more linear development in the bird catastrophe and never does the movie attempt to create a symbol or hidden/double meaning out of this. This is just cheap 60's horror, with strawman characters and moments that are today absolute clichés of the genre - and whether it was impressive visually for its time is absolutely irrelevant today, and additionally there's a terrible lack of attention to detail: all the scenes where they're outside where the birds are, forget to close doors despite the wind of chaos, etc etc...The fact there isn't music in key moments was nice, but terribly thin as an excuse to call this a cinematic masterpiece. This is another by-the-numbers lazy Hitchcock marketing/business idea, and once again he'd achieved undeserved recognition for a highly, highly overrated piece. A very lucky, right man in the right place character, Alfred Hitchcock, with an eye and a mind to seize the opportunity, and juice it.",5,6,14,21 September 2016
Beetlejuice," Not as great as it could've been but special
","Tim Burton directs Beetlejuice. This film is a totally wacky ride from start to finish that all in all achieves a quite complex plot with the main story of the protagonists with their own existential struggles colliding with the introduction of the sort of villain/anti-hero whose name is hilariously spelled 'Betelgeuse', played by Michael Keaton, an actor difficult to quite squeeze into a category, his performances are so eclectic and varied. He does a fine job, for a character very difficult to incarnate, but just like the film as a whole, it really does feel like missed opportunity, seeing the potential of such a unique character, with such a unique design/concept and humor, that even later became the object of a (fairly good) cartoon series. It's funny, very good in places, very developed and creative visually, quite entertaining, but it seems to lack on a certain level of depth and the elements at hand. Like they didn't make the best of what they had.",7,1,1,20 May 2016
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Fine Cohens Modern Fairy Tale
","This is one of the rare examples where good story telling and good execution alone are enough without a strong morality at the end or guiding principle. This is 'just' a well-told Cohens film, therefor special and setting itself apart from other productions of its time in the world of cinema; a modern fairy tale set in the early century deep south, with all sorts of crazy unlikely events, zany adventures, particular characters found along the way and along the miles traveled by the protagonists, miles of fun had by the viewers. This is cinema in its most gratuitous form - a simple experience of taking in the produce from the minds of film-making creators and enjoying it to the fullest, without any exercised effort to determine a particular goal within the plot or deeper meaning of the story. Just good fun, a tale with a beginning and an end, all the while rediscovering the folklore and flavors of that setting.",7,0,0,20 May 2016
