The Expendables 2," Re-living the classic action movies!
","I just love it! Its like watching a classic muscle bound 'no guts no glory' ' no pain no gain' bullets flying, everything exploding, testosterone packed action movie! Almost all of my favorite action stars were present stallone, arnold, willis, li, statham, van dame, norris, crew ( because of the movie white chicks which is not action thats why at first it was weird seeing crew serious. He always makes me want to smile) i just hope on the expendables 3 release it will have much much much more action stars. Classic action stars that is. All the younger dudes can wait. Expendables 2 is a great movie to watch and even own it on DVD. It will be one of my preferred disc to sample home theatre surround sound speakers. Great job on this production! Thanks for the entertainment!",10,1,10,6 September 2012
