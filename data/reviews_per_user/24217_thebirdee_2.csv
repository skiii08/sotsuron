Black Swan," Huh? I do not get all the acclaim.
","I have nothing against Natalie Portman, I swear I don't...but this has got to be the worst acting I've seen her do. If I didn't have a basic idea of the storyline before seeing this movie, I would not have had a clue wtf was going on. It's horrible. I don't know who gave it three out of four stars but they must have been high and seeing a movie I didn't see. I've seen many 10 stars on here...again, I just don't get how. The end didn't even shock or give me any kind of feeling. It just happened. The only way you can maybe get something out of this movie is if you are absolutely crazy about ballet. Even with that, I still don't see three out of four stars or any of the high praise people are giving it on here. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Had to force myself to watch it to the end.",1,4,7,4 October 2011
No Country for Old Men," What is everyone raving about?
","If it was possible to give negative stars I would. I really don't get what everyone is raving about. I even had a friend recommend this movie - now I'm gonna have to question his taste in movies. Horrible storyline, awful acting (except for Tommy Lee) and just dull. I kept watching, thinking it's got to get better. No such luck. And I couldn't help thinking the 'bad guy' has the worst hairstyle - I don't care if it is the early 80s, most 80s hair rocks, but not his. Not much else to say. Although it's kinda cool to see how easy it used to be to go to Mexico and come back to the U.S. Seems so weird now-a-days, with security the way it is. This is for the people saying the only reason someone doesn't like a movie is because they don't get it. I do understand the movie just fine. I just don't think it's good. Big difference. Calling anyone that doesn't like a movie you love stupid is rather immature. Again, understanding something and liking it are not the same thing.",1,4,11,28 February 2013
