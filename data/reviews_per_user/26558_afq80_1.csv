Minority Report," Uncredited extra?
","I love trying to see actors in cameo roles doing favors for directors, producers, etc. I didn't catch Cameron Diaz the first time I watched this movie. It wasn't until seeing her name on IMDb as an uncredited extra that I went back and saw her. You would never know it was her unless you were really looking carefully, since only half her face is on the screen for about a second. But, I did see someone that I think was not listed as an uncredited extra. When they are running through the mall (remember the balloon man), Agatha grabs a woman and tells her 'not to go home, he knows' (or something like that). The woman looks at Agatha like she was crazy. Was that woman in the mall not Lucy Liu??? Anyone else catch this?",Null,0,0,19 September 2005
