Your Name.," Outstanding Story Line
","I might be not a professional person on making movie review, but honestly if I don't tell you why this movie is deserved to be no. 1 in the world, I think it'll sound cheesy. So here's my review, AS a movie fans.It's anime. Some stereotype person who actually doesn't like animation movie might not interested to watch this, especially this is from Japan. I'm not naive, some people still think Hollywood animation is the best so they won't watch Japan animation movie. But seriously, change that thought guys. Watch animation movie from Ghibli Studio (recommeded: Howl's Moving Castel & Sprited Away. Disney even distributed them to the world). I'll say, those movie will literally blow your mind, as well as this movie. (period)Story. Not going to spoiler but fans of fantasy, drama, and romantic as well as comedic movie will truly love this. 'Your Name' has really fresh story line (never read or watch story like this before, anywhere). A bit complicated but seriously outstanding. You have to keep focus to find some clues for the next moment to happen. But if you just want to enjoy it without guessing any moment, I tell you, you'll get goosebumps many many times.And I think this movie will be nominated in Oscar next year ðŸ˜ƒ",10,4,8,12 December 2016
