First Man," Law of Averages!!!
","Damien Chazelle, you set our expectations so high with your first two films that a good film like this one feels below average. Without taking away your effort and heart into this one, whatever was your reason, this is a movie buff's request, please try and get back your rawness which made even a simple story look so complex and fresh.
Full marks for effort though. Thanks for First Man. Love!",6,1,2,7 November 2018
Jack Reacher," A Good Watch!!!
","A pretty good thriller at it's heart. Unveiling of the layers was interesting. I just had one doubt in my mind while watching this, whether they'll be able to sustain this conflict for two hours and that fear did come true. The scape of the story was too big for a story, this small. Still, by the time you start questioning this, the title credits start to roll.A one time watch if you don't have anything more interesting to do on a Saturday night. But I expect a lot more from Tom Cruise as a producer, he has himself set the bar so high, that the story of James Barr couldn't really surpass it.",7,0,0,7 November 2018
50_50," A Cancer Comedy Treat!
","A comedy about a protagonist who's suffering from cancer was the last thing I expected when I started watching this movie, without watching the trailer. But, the way it seeped inside my brain first, and then the heart, it's hard to express what I was feeling in the last act of the film. I'm sure it was hard for Lewitt's character too, yet this one won my heart and was a winner throughout. Loved Rogen and I've always loved you Anna Kendrick! It's a surprising watch as the roller coaster of emotions will keep you hooked. Thanks for making this film!",8,0,0,22 October 2019
