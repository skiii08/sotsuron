The Blair Witch Project," Awful, very hard to enjoy.
","I found this movie very annoying to watch.  I was not frightened, or scared at all.  Its all shot first person, and its very cheaply made.  I guess if you are an insomniac trying to get some sleep, this will work.Although its not all completely bad, a few funny lines are said, but for the most part, this is one to pass on.Don't believe the hype.",Null,0,1,30 July 1999
