Catch Me If You Can," A break from the serious dramas of this holiday season.
","Catch Me If You Can is based on the true life story of Frank Abagnale Jr., a con-artist who managed to create a series of false identities while stealing millions of dollars in one of the greatest check fraud schemes of all time. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Catch Me if you Can stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale and Tom Hanks as the FBI agent hot on his tale.     The film was both humorous and dramatic as we followed Abagnale though his many scams. Most notably the identities included an airline pilot and a doctor.  Dicaprio and Hanks made quite the excellent cat and mouse pair, and the intelligent dialog kept me entertained throughout. With all of the serious dramas out this holiday season, I recommend this movie is a good way to break the tension. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride!",Null,0,1,8 January 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Good special effects, but poor writing. James Cameron, we needed you!!
","Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the cybernetic half-human half-machine terminator in this sequel to the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This film begins just like its predecessors, two terminators are sent back through time. One is sent to protect members of the human resistance (Schwarzenegger), and another is sent by Skynet to terminate those who in the future lead the human's against the machines.
     Those who saw the first two films may be wondering how Skynet survived considering it was supposedly destroyed, and the global nuclear attack known as Judgment Day prevented. According to this film, Judgment day was only put off by the actions of John and Sarah Conner ten years earlier. This knowledge leads to a predictable story as a now adult John Conner, now played by Nick Stahl, must once again try to stop Skynet from being created while on the run from a more advanced terminator, the `TX' played by Kristanna Loken. Sarah Conner who was played by Linda Hamilton was not in this film, and the writers attempted to fill this void by adding Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), one of John's future Lieutenants and love interests.      The movie did very well in one area: special effects. The chase scenes between Conner and the TX nearly matched the level of intensity present in the second Terminator film. Unfortunately, the hole left by Hamilton, and Edward Furlong (John Conner in T2) was not filled by any of the new talent in this feature.  It led to a lack of believable emotion, and for me indifference towards the characters fate.       T2: Judgment Day was well acted, well written, and it contained special effects that were ahead of its time. Much of the credit for that goes to writer and director James Cameron. His absence from the third film hurt it deeply...what could have been another epic blockbuster unfortunately is just another average sci-fi action flick.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better Paced than the first, the battle for Isengard was excellent
","We have been waiting an entire year for this one!!! The Two Towers picks up right where last years Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring leaves off. The director, Peter Jackson, did not include a recap of the last movie, so if you don't remember what happened in the first movie you better rent it and refresh your memory before you head off to the theater.   
When we last left our fellowship, it had splintered apart. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue there quest to return the all powerful and evil ring to Mordor where it can be destroyed. They take on the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis) as their guide to Mordor despite Gollum's obsession with getting `his precious' back. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) begin by trying to find the kidnapped Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), but end up getting caught up in a battle to save a race of humans. The evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), controlled by Dark Lord Sauron created a grand Uruk-hai army that is sent to destroy the race of Humans at the fortress Isengard. The presumed dead Gandolf (Ian McKellen) also returns to lend his assistance in battling Lord Sauron's troops.     This film was better paced than the first in the trilogy. There were still some breaks in the action that were a little dull, but the dialog was necessary to further the story. With three separate stories going on simultaneously between the three groups of the splintered fellowship, the film kept the action moving quickly. Clocking in at 179 minutes, it is just one minute longer than the first film. This time, I didn't mind the length. The battle for Isengard comprised about a third of the film, and it was very intense.      The rest of the film had a lot of the same excellent cinematic shots as the first movie. The shots tracking the actors from above (done by helicopter) with the beautiful New Zealand mountains and countryside in the background were just amazing.  The landscapes helped to keep me involved with the story when the action slowed for dialog intensive scenes.      
The creature Gollum played a very key roll in this movie, and the computer-generated character was very lifelike and amusing. He reminded me of Dobby the `house elf' in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Gollum and the Dwarf were the two main comic relief characters in this very serious film.      To conclude, we had to wait a year for this film, and it lived up to expectations! A final reminderthis is the middle film in the trilogy so you can expect another ending that leaves you wanting more! Not to worry though, the third and final film is due out next Christmas.",Null,66,102,18 December 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Even more amazing that the first film!
","In the sequel to the 1999 hit, Keanu Reeves reprises his role as Neo, a human rebel who along with Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his crew try to free the humans enslaved by machines that now control earth. In this film the rebel leaders have only 72 hours to save the underground city of Zion before the machines drill through the earth and kill all the human inhabitants. To try and save humanity, Neo needs to renter the world of the Matrix to meet with The Oracle (Gloria Foster) who may hold the key to saving Zion.     The special effects in this film are even more amazing than the original Matrix film. You should be aware that the film does not have a real ending because the film is in two parts, the second part to be released later this year. Be sure to stick around through the end credits to see a brief preview of the next feature.",Null,0,0,3 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Much better paced than the first film, a must see!
","No matter what anyone says about this movie, we all know it is not going to stop the hordes of Harry Potter fans from rushing out to see this film. The director of the second installment, Chris Columbus (Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone) promised more action and improved special effects in the second Harry Potter installment, and he definitely came through!    
The movie starts us off at the end of Harry's horrible summer vacation with his comically terrible aunt and uncle, and leads us right into his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He has been warned, however, that he should not return by a little `house-elf' named Dobby. It turns out that someone has been terrorizing the school, and petrifying students (literally turning them into stone). In Harry's attempt to find out what's going on, he becomes the prime suspect that leads us on a very fast paced and exciting adventure for the rest of the film. Daniel Radcliffe seems much more at ease with the leading role this time around; in the first film he seemed a bit awkward.     This movie was definitely better paced than the first, there was a lot more action, and some pretty scary scenes that might upset some of the younger set. I am a little surprised it got away with the `PG' rating. If you are afraid of spiders, or snakes you may not like a few of the more scary scenes in this film. The climax of this movie was much more action intensive than the first, but it still turns out the same: Harry having to fend off evil on his own after his friends have become otherwise indisposed.      The second installment was much more humorous than the first. This is thanks in part to two new characters: Dobby the computer generated elf, and Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense against the dark arts teacher comically played by Kenneth Branagh. Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) also added to the comic relief during the more frightening scenes with his expressions of utter terror and panic that Harry never seemed to show in any situation. Be sure to stick around through the end of the credits for a brief humorous scene with Lockhart.     The cinematography and computer special effects were just as good as the first, but this time they were not stressed as much making the movie flow much better. For example, there were fewer long pans of the great hall, or of the changing stare cases. Although these elements were in the movie, they were not the focus of an entire segment like in the first film where more explanation was necessary. The flying car in the opening scenes, and the improved version of the broomstick sport Quiddditch were excellent. The faster paced game of Quidditch in this film was definitely much better than the first.      Another thing that impressed me with this movie was that I went the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes without looking at my watch! I was not able to do that in the first movie that clocked in at 2 hours and 30 minutes. If you didn't enjoy the first film, I would definitely suggest that you give this film a try because it is a real improvement.     My final notethe late Richard Harris did another superb job as Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore. As the film ended and the camera backed away from the great hall, I couldn't help but feel a little sadness knowing that this would be the last time I would see Harris on the screen. Some people in the theater with me were reading the credits, looking for a dedication or memorial to the actor who passed away just a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, this film was surely printed long before that, and the distributors would not have had the chance to add such a dedication. Even with out the dedication, I think his work speaks for itself. Thanks to film his legacy will live on, and we will never forget his great gift for acting.",Null,0,0,15 November 2002
Bruce Almighty," Typical Jim Carrey comedy with a predictable story.
","Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter living in Buffalo, New York. When Nolan is down on his luck both at work, and with his girlfriend he curses god. God played by Morgan Freeman responds by giving Nolan his powers for a week to see if he can do things any better. The film then takes off in the usual comedic fashion as Nolan tries to right his own life while ignoring god's other duties.     There were some particularly humorous moments as Nolan works to fix his work and love life. As expected, Nolan's new powers get the better of him and the world suffers as a result. Of course, all of Bruce's efforts fail to keep him together with his teacher girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. In the end, Bruce is forced to learn that even the powers of god cannot stop human free will.",Null,0,1,3 June 2003
X2: X-Men United," Even more dazzling special effects than the first film!
","Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Halle Berry reprise their comic book roles as the super powered human `mutants' who try to help people while keeping their identities secret. In this sequel, a mutant tries to assassinate the president leading to an invasion of the mutant school run by Charles Xavier (Stewart). New villain Gen. William Stryker (Brian Cox) captures Xavier in an attempt to rid the world of mutants for good. With the lives all mutants in jeopardy, the X-Men are forced to join forces with the evil Magneto (Ian McKellen) to stop Stryker from completing his mission.     While maintaining its roots in the Marvel Comic book series, X-Men 2 has even more dazzling special effects than the first film. With no need to introduce the characters, this film jumps right into the action. The story moves quickly with fewer slow spots than the first film. As the summer blockbuster season kicks off, I'm sure this movie will be an early favorite",Null,0,0,3 May 2003
Gangs of New York," Needs a visit to the editing room!!!
","Gangs Of New York, directed by Martin Scorsese has been long anticipated. It was slated for release over a year ago, but was pushed back because of postproduction issues. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz, Gangs tells the tail of a young man (Dicaprio) bent on revenging his fathers death at the hands of a rival gang leader (Day-Lewis) in Civil War Era New York City.     The film has many problems, the biggest being its unnecessarily long length. Clocking in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, Gangs could have told its story in less than 2 hours in a much more effective manner which would have kept its audience entertained throughout.  The middle of the film needed a visit to the editing room most of all. I found many of the slow paced dialog scenes both uninteresting and unnecessary to forward the plot. The cinematography was good, but not great. It left me wanting to see moreÂ…more of the city, more of the harbor.      The one place the film does excel is in its 20-minute climax. If I didn't have to suffer through the films first 2 hours, I might have been tempted to give the film a good review based on that very compelling sequence. Unfortunately since I did have to waste two hours of my life to get to that point, I just cannot recommend this film.",Null,0,0,6 January 2003
