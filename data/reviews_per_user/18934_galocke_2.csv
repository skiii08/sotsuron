E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," For five-year-olds only . . . and gullible ones at that
","An endlessly saccharine tear-jerker very cynically (in my opinion) designed to sell candy and pajamas and coloring books and what-have-you. Other one-star reviewers have pretty much summed up what this film represents. I agree with their comments. Seriously, I can tolerate and even luxuriate in sentimentality if it serves a legitimate artistic purpose. At least 'Madama Butterfly' (as just one example) manages to marry the flowing tears with wonderful music. Or, if you want to stick with movies, how about 'On Borrowed Time,' the 1939 cinematic masterpiece that just happened to star the great uncle of 'E.T.''s own cutesy version of a Barrymore.",1,5,15,22 March 2016
Edward Scissorhands," OK for five-year-old pajama-boys
","A shambles of a medieval castle atop a small but craggy mountain, both of which happen to be chock-a-block adjacent to a faceless 1960s tract-home subdivision -- in which, by the way, all of the homes are uniformly painted in a pink, blue, green, or blue pastel color. And for me, that is where the film's interest begins to wane. Simply put, 'Edward Scissorhands' is yet another Spielberg-like tear-jerker, from the oh-so-sensitive (but cardboard) characters on down to the treacly, chorus-tinged music score. If you like this kind of thing (cf. 'E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial'), you'll probably love this two-hour waste of time as well.",2,19,44,21 December 2013
