The Devil's Advocate," A devilishly enjoyable thriller
","After seeing Al Pacino in this movie, I truly understood the meaning of screen presence. He towers above any of his screen partners in this modern fable of the oldest evil.Keanu Reeves is a small town attorney driven by his own vanity and ambition, and his social climbing wife (Charlize Theron playing what I think was a fairly unsympathetic character) to accept a position with a high-powered New York law firm. Pacino is the senior partner. Oh, by the way, he's also the devil. He becomes Reeves' mentor, for reasons which become clear at the end of the film.This is a magnificently mounted and photographed film marred only by Reeves' wooden performance (I think he's a cool actor, but I didn't think the role suited him) and the Theron as the really irritating wife. But then, thank God (?) there's Al. Besides, any film that ends with the Stones' Paint it black can't be all bad. 3 out 4 with Al raising it from a 2.",Null,0,1,4 March 2002
Saturday Night Fever," Gritty urban tale
","1977 was the year in which iconoclastic punk and hedonistic disco dominated the music scene. How ironic then that the final number one single in the U.S. of that year was Debbie Boone's 'You light up my life'. While I think that the punk movement has never been well documented in film fiction, the more popular and mainstream disco culture had several major films dedicated to it. The best of these was Saturday Night Fever (SNF).The snag is that SNF was NOT a disco movie. Yes, it had dazzling dance sequences, yes, it had a pulsating soundtrack, and, yes, many of the scenes were shot in a disocteque, but I have always felt that the disco theme was peripheral to the real story; the alienation of youth and the acceptance and sanctuary they find in each other and their chosen surroundings. In fact, Nik Cohn's article on which the film was based (and which he later admitted was faked), 'Tribal rites of the new Saturday night' would have been a more apposite title. John Travolta perfectly captures this. As Tony Manero he almost ritually prepares himself for his night out, preening himself in front of the mirror, donning his warrior's uniform, and then escaping the drudgery of his existence to his battleground, the local disco where he is the tribal chief.Gritty, foulmouthed and somewhat downbeat, SNF starkly presented the darker underbelly of the disco subculture.",Null,5,6,28 April 2002

Love and Death," The little master meets the little dictator
","There are some critics who believe that in order to truly appreciate this film you need to have a good understanding of Russian literature. Nyet. I don't know my Dostoevski from my Tolstoy, and for years I thought the Brothers Karamazov were a family of Soviet trapeze artists, but that did not stop Love and Death from leaping straight to the top of my list of alltime favourite films.Made in 1975 (I've always thought Allen's best work was done in the Seventies), it is the story of a cowardly Russian who (very) accidentally becomes a war hero. It is the early 1800's and Russia is at war with Napoleonic France. Allen is Boris Grushenko, the youngest of three brothers in a rural family. Madly in love with Sonia, his cousin twice removed, played by a luminous Diane Keaton, he would rather philosophise and write poetry, but is instead drafted into the army. During the height of battle he hides in a cannon. The cannon is fired and he becomes a human cannonball who happens to land on a tent killing several French generals. He becomes the toast of Moscow, desired by beautiful women and reviled by their jealous lovers. But always in the back of his mind is his cousin Sonia. He even keeps a lock of her husband's hair to remind him of her. She is trapped in a loveless marriage to a herring obsessed businessman, and she has many affairs. They eventually find each other but just when life seems perfect she hatches a plan to assasinate Napoleon.If truth be told, any review of this comic gem would only do it scant justice. One has to see it to really appreciate the humour. It has sight gags aplenty, but also some marvellous dialogue. I also loved the incongruity of Allen's New York accent juxtapositioned against the perfect Russian accents of the supporting cast. There are many memorable scenes, highlights for me being the Black Russian drill sergeant, the verbal exchanges between Allen and Harold Gould, and the meeting between the real and the fake Napoleons.Prior to the success of Annie Hall, Allen's films were generally made with a limited budget, but this was no hindrance in this film. There was good costume design and lovely cinematography. I also enjoyed the use of composer Sergei Prokofiev's music to score the film.A sheer joy from beginning to end Love and Death is a lively and hilarious comedy to be savoured again and again.",Null,0,1,27 April 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Disappointing
","As a rule I prefer to comment on films that I have enjoyed. But when a film is really bad, and when it wins a clutch of Oscars to boot, I feel compelled to voice my disapproval.Perhaps my expectations were too high. I expected a witty and sophisticated British period comedy and instead got an uninvolving drama with a poor lead character. There is not much good about this film. Only the final scene with Gwyneth Paltrow moved me. The magnificent 'Life is beautiful' should have got the Best Film Oscar that year.",Null,1,2,28 April 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Red hot action thriller
","'T2' is a red hot action thriller which,in my opinion, is one of those rare occurences where a sequel is superior to the original.Even ten years later the special effects are amazing. The film also features a memorable villain in the T-1000 terminator.The only weaknesses are overlength and the fact that we are supposed to believe that the Edward Furlong character, young John Connor, a motor cycle riding, code deciphering delinquent, is just 10 years old (Furlong was 14 years old at the time).",Null,1,1,17 May 2002
Pi," A disappointment
","Filmed in beautiful black and white 'Pi' is the story of a mathematical genius, Max Cohen, who believes that numbers form the basis of the entire world and all its components. While developing a program which can accurately predict movements on the stock exchange he becomes distracted by, and ultimately obsessed with, the concept of pi, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.Thanks to director Darren Aronofsky,'Pi' becomes the 'Traffic' of independent films, a potentially brilliant film marred by pretentious direction.",Null,0,1,6 March 2002
Goodfellas," Sensational
","The true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a gangster working his way up the mob hierarchy, this is a sensational, brilliantly acted film, which, I suspect, presents a more realistic picture of the mafia than 'The Godfather', and that is in no way a criticism of that film.Director Martin Scorsese peoples his films with some of the most fascinating and repellent characters you never want to meet. 'Goodfellas' is no exception. It has just about everything going for it, including a terrific soundtrack (catch Sid Vicious' manic 'My way' at the end of the film). Perhaps most importantly, at a time when most films seem to be suffering from overlength, there is not a wasted or boring moment in the film's two and a half hour running time.My only question is: when is Scorsese ever going to win the Oscar?",Null,0,0,28 April 2002
