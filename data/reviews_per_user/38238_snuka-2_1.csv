Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great effects, sound...storyline is ?
","This was an all around excellent movie to watch and hear, but it still remains to be seen where Lucas was taking this film.  I was quite disappointed that the Sith were not fully explained, but I am sure that this and many other questions will be answered in Episodes II and III.  I am angry with the critics who feel that this is a bad movie.  It is not meant to stand alone, it is part of the other Star Wars movies, something that many critics are throwing aside.  I do give this movie a high mark, but only because I trust that Lucas will answer many of my questions in the future episodes.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
