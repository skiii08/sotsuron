Hereditary," A Surprise Waiting to happen
",Going into this movie I wasnt expecting that much. I thought this was going to be another horror movie about people getting possessed but it really wasn't like that at all. Yes someone gets possessed but the story isn't all about that. The movie is all about shocks and twists that leave you on the edge of your seat. It starts off a little slow like a drama almost but then it takes a 360 degree turn and then BAM it's a horror movie. When the character Charlie dies that's when the movie picks up its pace. The mother Annie starts losing her mind and starts creating a very uncomfortable atmosphere that in the end leaves you wanting more.,8,22,43,11 June 2018
