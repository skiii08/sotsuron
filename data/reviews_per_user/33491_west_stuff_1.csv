Captain Phillips," Very well acted and realistic.
","This movie was a nail-biter from the start. I felt that it gave a full, balanced view of this event. I like that it started out showing the situation from which the Somali pirates came into attempting to pirate this ship. It showed why they were so highly motivated to put themselves and everyone else at risk in order to attain the ransom money. Every person in this movie did an excellent job of acting. Of course Tom Hanks was crazy amazing in his role. How that guy does it, I cannot imagine. We felt like we were right their with him the entire time. I highly recommend this movie. It is important for us to see what things are like outside of our realm of reality here in the U.S. This was a true event and the situation in Africa and off the shores of Africa is real and important as we are all in this together. There are still pirates but apparently (and hopefully) the cargo ships are better armed to defend against such attacks. See it!!!! Love Tom Hanks!!! Never saw a Tom Hanks movie that wasn't amazing. ... except maybe DaVinci Code.",9,1,7,13 October 2013
