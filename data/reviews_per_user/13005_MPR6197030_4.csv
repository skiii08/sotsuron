Marie Antoinette," Off With Her Head
","Before I begin, let me say that I am an ardent fan of Sofia Coppola's work. I also enjoy period pieces, and don't mind when filmmakers take historical liberties (i.e. an anachronistic music score 치 la 'A Knight's Tale.' That having been said, 'Marie Antoinette' is a complete disaster. It's obvious that Coppola spent most of her $40 million budget on dresses and shoes. And like a beautiful corset, the frills and lace conceal everything else within. The acting, characters and even the delivery is not worth an audience's emotional investment.Indeed, it's hard to follow up such a glorious film as 'Lost in Translation,' and there's little doubt that Coppola will one day be back at the top of her game. But in the meantime, Marine Antoinette deserves nothing less than the guillotine.",3,0,1,16 February 2007
Gone Baby Gone," Disappointing, Contrived
","Like 'Mystic River,' Bostonians (and fans of that epic city) have lauded 'Gone Baby Gone' as yet another 'masterpiece.' The truth is that Ben Affleck brings the same lackluster feel to his directing as he does to most of the films he chooses to star in. Sure, the script is snappy, with dialogue that hits the viewer like a slap to the face, but the plot is overly contrived and the twists are elementary at best.While Casey reinforces the fact that he is a fine actor destined for great things, he is terribly miscast (probably, let's see, because he's the director's brother). Maybe its his slight frame or boyish looks, but Casey plays a tough guy about as well as a high-school cheerleader. Even Morgan Freeman seems out of place as a Georgian uprooted and serving in the Boston PD. As portrayed in the film, he doesn't seem to fit in either world.The direction from Ben Affleck, too, seemed very amateur. Ben fancies himself an auteur, but the film instead comes off as amateurish. The quick cuts and blackout voiceovers only reinforce this point. Let's face it Ben: you're not Paul Greengrass.'Gone Baby Gone' carries a certain amount of emotional gravitas, which is why parents probably relate to and enjoy the film. But let's not pass off mediocre film-making as great cinema.",5,10,18,7 March 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," I Heart Huckabees Meets Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy
","Reading this, you probably think that the above comparison is strange. After all, 'Stranger than Fiction' has no terminally depressed robots, Babel fish or elevators with an immense desire to drive sideways. But listen to the narrative and you'll hear echoes of Douglas Adams' whimsical voice and imaginative style.Except for pacing problems in the middle, 'Fiction' is a grandly satisfying film with great performances and thought-provoking themes. Many viewers have compared Will Ferrell's performance to that of Jim Carey in 'The Truman Show.' It's great to see so many SNL alumni are breaking the mold and transcending their genres; I have no doubt that Ferrell and Adam Sandler, among others, will one day give a thank-you speech at the Oscars.Ferrell's supporting cast, too, delivers excellent performances. Emma Thompson is brilliant as an eccentric writer trying to complete her novel, while Maggie Gyllenhaal shines as a leading romantic lady. (Though Gyllenhaal excels at indie roles, it's nice to see her in something traditional, albeit with a twist.) As mentioned, 'Stranger than Fiction' loses momentum toward the middle, but patient viewers are sure to reap the benefits as Karen Eiffel delivers the film's final lines.",8,0,1,27 February 2007
Casino Royale," The Name's Craig, Daniel Craig.
","Unlike many of the naysayers, I was happy with the announcement that Daniel Craig had been cast as James Bond. I had seen Craig in 'Layer Cake' and loved his performance, thinking that the character of 'Mr. XXX' would be a good template for him to base Bond. This having been said, Craig makes an excellent Bond, down to his haircut, overall demeanor and chemistry with Vesper Lynd.'Casino Royale' is, thankfully, a very literal adaptation of the Ian Fleming novel, the first in the franchise to take so few liberties. Having read the book makes the film slightly monotonous충readers will know exactly how the plot turns out충so seeing Craig in an original Bond storyline should be an excellent treat. Perhaps the films greatest, and thus far unspoken, performance belongs to Eva Green as Vesper. Green captures her character better than any male performer has captured Bond충and that's saying something since Craig and Timothy Dalton were very close to the 'literary Bond.' As such, Green is very much Craig's equal, a powerful leading female better than all of Bond's 'strong female characters' (read: Jinx) that have appeared in the past.Overall, 'Royale' marks an exciting new direction for the series. It's a long way off, but Bond 22 promises to be something special.",7,1,3,17 November 2006
