The Longest Yard," the longest yard was good
",i'd first like to say that of coarse the original one was better. i was very surprised though with the movie. it kept to the original plot but with a lot more comedy and bigger names. this was definitely a movie worth seeing again. Adam Sander was funny as he usually is and the performance that Nelly gave was very surprising. even Stone Cold gave a convincing performance. the small cameo that Burt Reynolds gave was amazing and hilarious. this movie showed that directors don't always ruin originals.equivocate.titans for life. movies are the best. long live movies and original ideas. i recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh. cry. and pee their pants.,8,2,6,20 June 2005
