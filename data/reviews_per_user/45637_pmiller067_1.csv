The Ring," Best 'scare-um-up' I've seen in years
","I am a 48 year-old male, who is a former football player- tough-guy, and this film scared the he** out of me!Great story development that carries things along well, without the need for a bunch of special effects. The ending made me squirm so far down in my seat, that I had to wipe the popcorn and sticky goo from the floor off of my knees, when I left the theatre.I am not a big fan of slasher movies, or movies that rely on overblown soundtracks to get you moving.  In this movie, the visuals and the sound were icing on the cake. The story is one of those great 'urban myth' 'campfire stories' that leaves you crawling with 'what if...'My other two favorite movies of this ilk are 'Ghost Story' and The Changeling.'  Both had similar themes, but 'The Ring' took things to a new level of 'creepy.'I will be sure and send my friends blank videos for Christmas... then call them and whisper '7 days...'",9,0,0,28 October 2002
