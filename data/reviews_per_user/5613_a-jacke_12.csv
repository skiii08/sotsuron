Vertigo," Hitchock most private film
","This film has much to do with Marcel Proust - its about a melancholical and losing time!!! I think its his best film - and Madline before called Manderlyn (Rebecka) is that cookie, who will Proust eat ins his recherche. A complicated story about the finding of a dead girl. An obsession of a man, who can never forget! What should I say - sad sad sad.",Null,0,1,8 November 2002
The Others," A ghost-story
","A house in england. Fog all the time. Two children never have seen they sun. A mother ( N.Kidman) who teached them as good as she can. A husband more a ghost than a human being, who comes back and goes away on the other day. Three other persons, who worked in the house. At the end: who is living - who is dead? Who is a ghost - and who is real person? A story like the best ghost-storys from Henry James. An actress like a beautiful Kidman, you have never seen before. A great film.. better than every short-story from E. A Poe. Hear the night-music from Chopin and take a candle on, like I do after I've seen this film!!! The others a important word for Jaques Lacan!",Null,0,0,16 August 2002
Velvet Goldmine," Stupid film
","Excuse me, but this is film is really not important, because tells a wrong story without a good taste - and plays Roxi Music songs to a character, who should be David Bowie. Uninteresting. Only a little bit about the history of 'Glam Rock' ist interesting.",Null,5,9,1 October 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Only the best film in this century
",Okay - 'moulin rouge' is the film who i liked most in last five years. First there is the great pop music - who have made this film to an great event. Bowies 'Heros' become never a better place before - as a love song on an elephant. Secund there was a white girl from Australia -who made it tragic and comedy from one the other moment. She is so beautiful and funny that no man can ever forget here - and thats is the story of the film. A legendary story about a phantasy's in Paris - in a place who has never been there so as in the film is shown. A psychological dimension - about the greatest think in the world: LOVE. and that in a good and funny way... I love this film because he is more than all the others a film about a feeling and he has catch it. And is a film with the greatest actress in our time who became better and better...,10,1,4,11 May 2005
Moulin Rouge!," A very good Musical
","Moulin Rouge is a place in Paris, who is shown in this film in a form, its never have existed. In his fast comedy speed this film is like a a run on a highway. And on the other side, in his tragic moment, he nearly stopped the time. He is between fun and tragic, love and death.  Kidman as Satine, the star in the Moulin Rouge sing in the beginning an old but very famous Marilyn Monroe Song 'Diamonds are Girls best friend' who had also a return in Madonnas 'Material Girl' in the 80ties. The film mixed it in one moment. But Kidman sing a cooler version as Monroe and more sophisticated as Madonna. When she sing 'Heroes' together with her lover the make it better than David Bowie himself, because when she sing 'I drink all the time you' she drinks not like Bowie 'the time' -she drinks tea all the time. Thats it! The story is a really simple love story, but thats not the point, what this film makes with it, is really exiting.",10,0,1,16 August 2002
Annie Hall," Only Great
","This is one of the greatest films Woody Allen would ever do. I Think is his beast one, than came Zelig, or something like this. And is a little bit better than 'Manhatten'.And in the last is Diane Keaton who makes this wounderful comedy to an great moment in the history of cinema..Here nice expression of the chaotic Annie Hall never would be forgotten. In Germany the film is called: 'Der Stadtneurotiker' who is a wrong title.. because much Woddy Allen Film can have this title, about there is only one Annie Hall.",Null,0,1,18 March 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," Thge master of cinema pushed a great actress
","Everybody knows that Kubrik is the one of the great masters in the history of cinema. And his last film is a great final and nothing else.With this film, I would say the acting of Kidman have to become another dimension. What Jane Champion or Gus van Saint never have shown Kubriks show us from her in 10 minutes. The dialog between Kidman and Cruise after they have smoke a joint is so real and important that much of my friends tell me that they were angry about her in this scene. 'She is searching a conflict' they say. But it is the truth??? I think that it is not the problem. The problem is that her husband in this film and with him many people don't understand anything of her fantasies. Or they don't want understand. I think what the wife is saying in this scene to her husband is not a provocation - it's a real problem for her, too.With her fantasies his jealous run begin - the motivation for the complete film is given and Kubrik also as Schnitzler make a story about a man. But in the beginning and again in the end in this film the scenes with Kidman are so good that here at the first time everybody can see how much she can.Here and before in 'Portrait of a young lady' in the end slumbers fill her eyes - and the tragic dimension of life become the result of it all. They details of it you must see by yourself, but never forget that they stopping of this fantasies is impossible. Because so you can understand that the end is not the end, because there is no end - for her - for him it is possible. Thank you for reading.",10,1,2,11 May 2005
Psycho," 'Psycho' is not the best of Hitchcocks movies
","The most people think, that this is Hitchcocks best movie, but it is only a second class horror film. ('The Birds' are so much better and in opposition to it - because there's the girl, who fights against the birds but Marion in 'Psycho' had no chance.) This film is not sophisticated or sensitive at last it is a trash movie. To murdering his mother is the most criminal act a person can do. That Marion Crane is murdered in the first twenty minutes it is a sign for the whole film... Melanie in 'The Birds' will be living on. With the killing of the leading actor in the famous scene in the bathroom, the film stops and find never back. (You have exactly the same scene in the end of 'The Birds', but Melanie will be saved by Mitch.)At last: to show a skeleton of a mother with this thrill is not a part of criminal story, and leave bad taste in one's mouth. I don't like this film very much, but the music from Hermann is great.",Null,0,2,24 January 2003
A Hard Day's Night," The 'toppermost of the poppermost'
","A clear picture from the 60ties. Four Boys and many, many, many girls, who were crying when they saw them. Very harmonic pop-music, the English- feeling, sophisticated and ironic. They alway try to make a joke of life. McCartney - the sunny boy, Lennon as complicated, Harrison the intro-men and Ringo Starr, as the boy with the most sentimental feelings and the big noise. See it, love it.",Null,1,2,15 August 2002
Gangs of New York," unimportant
","S. new picure-- he made great cinema, Perfect Pictures. But the story - is there something new? no nothing-- and he told this better in 'Taxi Driver - the strange men world of fighting and killing  the others. an unimprotant film -because whats the sense?",Null,0,0,3 April 2003
Contact," Across the universe
","Foster went across the universe to find her dead father again and talk with him in a simulation. The picture from Hitler is the first sign for life on an other planet. But they don't know what in means. The film works with much historical themes. Its a film a about science and history, in a personal and in a political way. A interesting'science-fiction' with much more intelligence and logic as E.T.",Null,1,3,15 August 2002
The Birds," Scary Monsters?
","The most interesting question of this film is the question - why attack the birds the people? In the short story from Daphne de Maurier (called The Birds too) the answer is easy - the complete story based on the attack of the Germans on England in the second world war.A man is standing at the ocean and see the birds a coming like airplanes. The complete english country is attacked. Hitchocks film has changed this things. Only one town called Bodega Bay was attacked and the person in the center of the story is not a man (as by Maurier) either a women. She is it who was first attacked. She has big psycho-problems with the relation to her mother - and in Mitch mother this old conflict become a new dimension. As bigger the love story between Melanie and Mitch as most the birds will attack the people. Lydia is against this love - and thats one point in the conflict who was never directly seen between the women.
In other words: The conflict between the women who are mirroring themselfes in the other has an paranoid dimension - on this place the birds are situated. They are the sign of this paranoid picture world- the are the result of the conflict for the visitor of this film. Scary is the great dimension they have - not the hole country but the hole town. This are the two points of a paranoid structur: projection and universal. - The psycho dimension become a place in reality! A real protection is impossible - because the beginning of the attacks is inside the subject - thats the reason why Hitchock let left the title 'The End' in the end of this film - because the conflict in Melanie have no end inside this film. The scary monsters - the birds will be peaceful again, when she will find a solution for her conflict. We have an apocalyptic picture in the end - who is not an end - the birds are sitting there but in the next moment they can attack the people again. The sky is dark - the world is in danger.",Null,0,0,6 November 2002
