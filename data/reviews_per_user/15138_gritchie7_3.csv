Mission: Impossible III," By far the Best Of MI franchise!
","I loved the first film when it came out, the second film was pretty to look at, and after the recent Ghost Protocol (MI4) I have to say this is the best of the bunch.Another reviewer compared it to True Lies. I would agree that it has that perfect balance of fun, escapism and entertainment balanced with just enough reality to buy into it. It is not easy to pull off!I am a sap though, and love the fact their is a real romance in this one. It adds to the tension so much more than when there is no emotional strings to play on the audience like in the most recent addition. Also the supporting cast is so good in this movie. The bad guy played by PSH (an Oscar winner) really makes the difference.Save your money. Buy MI1 and MI3 and pretend the others don't exist!",10,4,6,21 December 2011
Warrior," Incredible movie, totally unexpected
","I don't usually write movie reviews, but I felt compelled to after seeing this sensational film. I can't believe that it didn't get a wider release in Canada, or somehow slipped by me. I am not a big UFC fan, or fight fan for that matter, and nor is my wife (who balled her eyes out in several emotional climaxes of the film); so don't believe that it's a film only for fight fans. It is in fact more of a family drama with UFC as the vehicle and backdrop in which to tell that story.Nick Nolte is amazing in this movie, and totally steals every scene he is in. Tom Hardy is incredibly different than anything he has done before and I commend him for it. Joel Edgerton is perfect as the family man you can't help but route for. In fact, I found myself wanting nothing bad to happen to any of the main characters in this movie and that's why it was such a success. The characters are developed perfectly and it grabs you emotionally without you realizing.In conclusion, let me make some bold statements: This is my favourite film of 2011. I hope more people get to see it as it is excellent. I also think it is a better film than Rocky, but obviously not as groundbreaking. whoa, right!",10,2,7,3 December 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Don't believe the Hype! MI1 & 3 are a lot better!
","I was so excited to go see this as I am a big fan of the franchise. I can even watch MI2 without cringing too much. The latest addition is terrible but by no means does it have the engrossing effect of the first and third movies from the franchise.For me it's biggest flaws were it's villain (Hendricks character is not developed and not played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), it's supporting cast (Not a patch on previous teams and characters) and the lack of emotional involvement (romance or family storyline, something that you can relate to or care about). I was so excited to see Jeremy Renner after really enjoying The Hurt Locker but his role wasn't developed enough. A lot of the character development felt forced. I thought if Jeremy Renner was the bad guy it might have been better.It's not all bad though. The action sequences were pretty good and there was some good comic relief from Simon Pegg, albeit not quite fitting in with the franchise and genre.I guess in summary, all I can say is I was sadly disappointed. Might still be worth a watch though. A lot of people seem to like it. I just don't know why.",6,1,6,21 December 2011
