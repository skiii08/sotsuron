The Blair Witch Project," Ruggero Deodato's Young Nephews??
","Good movie, well-written, well-executed. The acting of the three principals was totally convincing and the film very economically established their individual personalities and the relationships between them. In total, the film was 100% believable. So far so good.Fundamentally, however, it is little more than a sanitized retread of Ruggero Deodato's 1979 exploitation classic 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Deodato's film is gory and dubious as hell. Especially hard to stomach are its scenes of real animal slaughter as its team of beleagured documentarians find food where they can in the dense tropical jungle.But the plot of Deodato's film develops thus: an expedition into the jungle finds the remains of a group of missing documentary film-makers. The remaining three-quarters of the film consists of their unedited rushes, replete with scratches, lab marks etc. Shots are out-of-focus, without sound or damaged. All these elements are shamelessly plagarised by the makers of 'Blair Witch'.Likewise, Deodato's actors do all the camera work using two cameras in much the same way as the 'Blair Witch' teens. The use of alternating video and 16mm is 'Blair Witch's single technical innovation.Blah blah blah, I could go on. The point is that I feel that the 'Blair Witch' boys owe a significant debt of gratitude to Deodato, who was himself no monkey, having worked as Roberto Rosselini's assistant for many years and worked his way up the neo-realist ladder. His career peaked with the brilliant and highly original 'Cannibal Holocaust'.I am sure the same will finally be said of the makers of the brilliant, highly unoriginal 'Blair Witch Project'.On the other hand, God bless them for kicking the ass of 'The Haunting'.",Null,0,0,9 August 1999
The Matrix," Real deal sci-fi.
","This is a ludicrous film. Loud, brash and generally bombastic at every turn. Fortunately, it knows this and wears these features on its sleeve. It is knowing and ironic and has its tongue firmly in its cheek. The ideas, which will no doubt be hailed as 'startlingly original', are all stolen from Philip K. Dick, but at least its stealing from the best. It is basically familiar territory, territory mined by Dark City only a few years back. The Matrix, however, is an immeasurably superior film, simply by virtue of the fact that it does not take itself seriously. At times, the characters play their ludicrous lines so deadpan, it achieves a bizarre spooflike quality. Fishburne's performance, in particular, is splendidly arch as he delivers lines like 'Welcome to the desert of the real' with a misplaced Shakespearean grandeur.The effects are also ground-breaking and mostly effective. The use of slo-mo to eroticize the violence is reminiscent of Woo or even Peckinpah but with the use of clever CGI, Matrix achieves the feel of ballistic science. The shootouts do not revel in the familiar 'operatic grandeur' that has been a staple since Bonnie and Clyde. Rather, they play like FBI reconstructions of shootouts. We see the paths that bullets take, the positions of spent shell casings. It is shamelessly fetishistic and utterly irrelevant to the film's central idea but spectacular and exciting nonetheless.I hate virtually everything. Dark City was a nauseating waste of my time. Everything released over the last three summers has seemed despicably lazy film making. Godzilla, Armageddon...these films are offensive cynical money pits without a single grain of wit, a single interesting idea to tie the whole rotten mess together. Therefore, I fully anticipated hating the Matrix with equal vigor. As it was, I was pleasantly surprised. While I would make no claims that it was in any way a classic, it certainly appeared to have been put together with a great deal of love and humour and these attributes go a long way. It was overlong and unnecessarily portentous at times but these are minor quibbles when one is being bombarded by such a wealth of outrageous imagery and ideas. What other film could link Dick, Christ, Alice in Wonderland, Monty Python, Woo, Jackie Chan,  and still find time to make Keanu Reeves look good?",8,1,3,23 March 1999
