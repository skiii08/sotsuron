Casablanca," A comforting and reassuring delight
","Living in chaotic Britain in 2019, on the verge of a great societal transition, Casablanca re-instilled some faith in my bleak outlook on the near-future. It's been enlightening to finally watch this timeless film and realise how many times it is referenced across cinema. I find the audio in Casablanca very consoling because the hubbub of background noises are muffled, so my attention is solely taken in the soundscape of the current scene. And yes that may sound peculiar, but it makes me very relaxed!Looking at the other reviews, there is not much more to add besides the wondrous tingling sensation I felt when the café stands to sing Le Marseillaise to drown out the singing of the German soldiers, and the slightly comic repetition of Signor Ferrari swatting insects at the end of each scene in which he appears.To any people of Generation Z put-off by black and white films (or anyone at all for that matter) give up on the Netflix pulp and spend your time watching awe-inspiring films like this!PS: We'll ALWAYS have Paris.",9,4,4,6 October 2019
Monty Python's Life of Brian," 'Do you find it wisible...when I say the name...Biggus...Dickus?'
","Famous lines from Michael Palin as Pontius Pilate...and also my favourite lines from this wondrous film. This is not a piece of criticism, just an exhibition of love. For those of you who believe that Holy Grail is better - I'm sorry to inform you that you're wrong. Life of Brian has such good consistent humour that really can't be beaten. The variety and range of characters the Pythons play is sublime. The chemistry they have with each of other is what makes the film work so well. I won't ramble on anymore because most of what I want to say has already been said!Afterthought: Well, what is myrrh anyway?",10,9,13,21 March 2019
Midnight in Paris," If I were Owen Wilson summing-up this film: wOw.
","I wish I could live in Paris in the '20s... well at least the one Woody Allen reimagines in such a beautifully nostalgic manner. However, as a poet, I believe that T.S. Eliot deserved more screen time - and if I were to meet him I would make sure I never travelled back to modern day!Owen Wilson plays the character Gil, a liberal screenwriter who is clearly not suited for his materialistic partner Inez (Rachel McAdams). Wilson is perfect for this role, taking on a very relaxed and contemplative character who lacks the interest in the superficial pleasures of Parisian tourism (in complete contrast to his consumerist fiancée).I thoroughly enjoyed the transition between time periods through the changes in lighting: modern day Paris flourishes with lush greens and blues, the '20s has warmer in sepia tones, and when Adriana and Gil travel back to the 1890's the sepia turns to a more garish yellow similar to the colour of oil lamps.Allen makes us consider what Paris has lost since the '20s, how as a society we have lost our creative freedom and creative communities that enable us to thrive. However, the film also comments that we should lose our nostalgia and rediscover the beauty of modern day as after all it's the time period we're stuck in! Whatever you take from the film it is a Woody Allen classic with gentle humour, stunning cinematography, and effortless flow.P.S. Tom Hiddleston I am sorry I still find you too arrogant.",8,0,0,19 April 2019
The Revenant," '...and the World Record for the Longest Distance Crawled on Front goes to...'
","Iñárritu's selection of dramatic and kinetic camera shots paired with Lubezki's cinematography makes this a very attractive film. DiCaprio's fight with the grizzly bear is an electrifying exhibition of cinema. Hardy exhibits such bitterness and hardship that I rank his performance very marginally above DiCaprio's. Nonetheless, DiCaprio's perseverant and relentless Hugh Glass is a worthy winner of an Oscar - which should have really been awarded for his sublime performance in Django Unchained.Afterthought: Had to watch the film in subtitles as Hardy is very difficult to understand. The sound quality on Netflix was imbalanced which slightly spoiled it for me.",8,0,1,3 January 2019
Joker," Well thank goodness he let poor Gary live!
","My immediate reaction coming out of the cinema was that the film would be better suited as a play. This being because in the film there are only really four main settings: the apartment, the city, the subway, and the comedy club/theatre/television studio. Especially with the last setting(s) I mentioned, as a play the various reactions of a live audience could add realism and also an active reciprocal interaction between Arthur and an audience which I think would be more entertaining.I agree with my friend's opinion of the film, for which he believed the range of issues covered was 'as wide as a sea but as deep as a pond'. The main issues such as mental health, misogyny, class, politics, and parental relations (as well as many others) were all raised and recognised as issues but were not explored in any depth, again as my friend put beautifully he believed Phillips was 'tickboxing' issues that are meaningful to current audiences.When Arthur is sitting alone at the back of the bus, the CGI outside the back window is horrendous. There is also a weird camera shake when Arthur climbs into the fridge, which from the angle makes you think this is from a first-person perspective of an unknown person in Arthur's flat, but then there is a cut and on reflection seems bizarre. Clearly Phillips ran out of budget and had to film on a potato.The musical score was excellent until it was muddled with contemporary music (for example when Arthur dances down the concrete steps) which was a jarring and incongruent.On a more positive note, Phoenix's Joker was original and superbly acted. Arthur having a condition making him laugh creepily and inappropriately was an authentic and believable aspect of his character. Phoenix is very effective at laughing with dead and soulless eyes, making him seem utterly sinister.Similar to Hamlet, The Joker can be played in many different ways because of the ambiguous complexity of his character. Phoenix's Joker is a victim of the worst aspects of society, fragile, and deeply forlorn. This being a very different interpretation to the assertive and more dominant representations in Leto's or Ledger's performances.All in all, a good watch but please someone adapt it into a play!PS: I want that suit.",6,8,14,25 October 2019
Hitch," If this film were a cheese it would be Feta - a good tangy cheese but nonetheless a cheese
","I've watched this film many times and enjoyed it. However, on my most recent watch I enjoyed it the least. As Rom-Coms go it's up there as a classic, however at points it's a cliché love-fest. The number of insincere inspirational quotes sounds like Smithy is reading from a Pinterest board (if Pinterest had been founded five years prior). On the other hand, I have had many entertaining hours watching and rewatching this film so thank you Andy Tennant.Question: Kevin James - actor or good at falling over?",6,0,0,3 January 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A maniac's menagerie provoking spine-tingling ecstasy
","A Raymond Carver-esque film centred around a Raymond Carver play. And it works beautifully. The perfect pairing of Alejandro González Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki have made an entrancing masterpiece. The skill of the camerawork dwarfs The Revenant, and though uses a limited set makes it entertaining and engaging throughout. The harsh neon colour palette catalyses the insanity of Birdman. The jazz accompaniment gave me jazz fever which was enrapturing as I danced along with the film's rhythmic ferocity. The humour was tasteful, the script was beguiling in its utter randomness. And who doesn't enjoy various jabs at avaricious Hollywood?Afterthought: I forgot how good Edward Norton is. Just forget about him in Sausage Party.",10,0,0,4 January 2019
