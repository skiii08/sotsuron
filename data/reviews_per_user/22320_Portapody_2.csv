The Blair Witch Project," How could you not like this movie?
","Oh my god, how could you not like this movie? I've got friends who HATED this movie, and I just don't know why. It's very realistic, and very scary. I DO NOT get scared from movies, but this one was scary for me. In fact I got it for Christmas this year! It's one of my favorite movies.",10,1,2,19 December 1999
The Shining," Gotta see it!
","I find it hard to believe that there are some who don't like this movie! How could you not? I got so scared the first time I saw it...I was only 6, but that's not the point. It's nothing but non-stop thrills the whole time. The two girls frieked me out the most. It's not the least bit boring. You watch as Jack slowly goes insane...what's boring about that? Jack Nicholson does a fantastic job playing the role of Jack Torrance. Shelly Duvall is a bit annoying, but I think that's just the character. People ALWAYS compare this movie and the book. Look, it's based upon the novel, not the exact novel word for word, scene for scene. If you want to see the novel in a movie, go see the mini-series that was way more based on the book, but wasn't as good as the original movie! See this one, it's the BEST!",10,0,1,23 December 1999
