The Blair Witch Project," Creative and original idea not to be mimicked
","Brilliant idea:  a movie so realistic it's *real* until you know for sure that it's not.  The makers of this film went to so much trouble, in fact, to make it seem real, that even given that I knew it was just a movie, I had to reconvince myself it wasn't real after viewing the film and checking out the web site.  To be sure:  it's nice to believe it's real if you want to get really, really scared.  As a movie, though?  Mediocre.  They could have done more with the legend to build up the plot, without taking away from the 'real' aspect one bit.  The footage they include doesn't include enough interviews or background to be pieced into a true documentary anyway.  I wasn't quite as afraid as I wanted to be, in all honesty.  If people try to copy this idea, however, they will FAIL.  This is the type of thing that can only be done once successfully.  I don't want to be going to a bunch of scary home movies and getting headaches all over the place every summer.  I recommend seeing this movie solely on its creativity, though.",7,1,1,3 August 1999
Ghost," Good entertainment... never mind about the rest!
","I love this movie, and no matter how many times I see it (and no matter how many more flaws I see each time), I will continue to think of it as a good, kind of sad/poignant, and very interesting thing to watch.   It's one of those well-known movies that can easily be referred to as a 'classic,' when maybe the acting and directing weren't perfect, or the storyline was flawed, or whatever.. I've heard this referred to as a 'chick flick,' which I don't necessarily agree with, as those kinds of movies typically sicken me, but if it is one, it's one of the best I've seen!  (I didn't care for some of the make-out scenes though... especially the one where it was really him in Whoopi Goldberg's body... I mean, could you really ignore that if you were in that situation?)  And Unchained Melody is so beautiful.... You won't see me get this mushy over much else!",8,3,4,8 January 1999
The Rookie," simplistic, but great!
","Right, so there isn't a whole lot of conflict, and what there is is fairly shallow.  So what?  It's a G movie, and a darn good one at that.  The kids are ADORABLE.  The baseball is fun.  It's generic, but it hits the 'warm, fuzzy' spot.  Dennis Quaid is cool.",8,1,1,1 May 2002
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Crossin the line
","I never thought I would use the word 'brilliant' to describe the South Park movie.  The satire was not only both clever and creative, but hilarious. The realism of some of it was incredibly disconcerting, but that's not what you leave the theater thinking about.  It was truly funny, and it amazes me how far they were willing to go with certain jokes, and what lines they were willing to cross.  The 'musical' aspect of it was also surprisingly good. Fun movie you can actually think about.  Cool.",Null,0,0,10 July 1999
Batman Returns," I feel unworthy to judge this film...
","...but I'd have to say I liked it well enough.  I'm a newcomer to Batman (I rented the first one last week and saw this a few hours ago) and I'd have to say my favorite part of the movie is the eccentric villain personalities. Although I think nothing can beat the Joker in 'Batman,' Pfeiffer and DeVito did a good job making their characters look (long pause...) EVIL, in a cartoon-like way.  The villains cannot entirely be taken seriously, of course, as Joker epitomizes, but really, what IS Batman without the bad guys?  I enjoyed the transition from mild-mannered, single secretary to 'femme fatale' Catwoman.  I enjoyed this movie, but I barely know anything about the comic, the TV series, etc... so you probably want to rent it and form your own judgement, but in any case, worth viewing!",Null,0,0,7 January 1999
Notting Hill," Entertaining...ok for a chick flick
","As I said to my friend as I left Notting Hill, I tend to like Julia Roberts movies, despite the fact that she plays the same character in every one. The same indignant stare and the same hurt-about-to-cry gulp, for example. Her revelatory, heartwrenching speeches all strike the same chord in my mind.  But that's okay, because I like her style for some reason, and I almost always enjoy watching her films, at least while they are taking place.  Notting Hill was no different.  I laughed hard, I enjoyed the plot for the most part, and the eccentric characters.  But I left thinking, 'mediocre.'  Why?  Well, the cheese factor, for one.  I know this is a love story, but PLEASE.  They concentrated WAY too much on that, and way too little on what I thought would be the interesting part.  They should have put more media hassle in there.  There was this one cool artistic scene with Hugh Grant walking through the streets and the seasons.  That was neat. Also, I mean, the characters were pretty good.  It may have been more effective NOT to use a real high name actress to play the part, but then again, it was easy to relate.  Oh well, it's not a waste of your money, but it's not the best film I've seen in its genre.",6,1,1,6 June 1999
American Beauty," In awe of this film from acting to music to cinematography
","This film was shown in a special 'sneak preview' type thing for free at my school, which was great for me.  I'm a Kevin Spacey-aholic, so I HAD to get tickets.  In fact, this movie probably indirectly caused me to drop the class I had a problem set due for, and would have had to miss the movie to work on.  But it was WELL WORTH IT.  This is one of the three movies I've ever rated a '10,' and it was because every moment of the film was well-crafted, well-acted, and just absolutely BRILLIANT.The characters, though eccentric, were extremely real and every actor was perfect in their role.  Kevin Spacey, in particular, was outstanding, and the guy who played the 'guy from next door' was great too. 
The music enhanced every single scene.  I might describe that as 'perfect' too.  (planning on getting the soundtrack)While the movie has very serious themes and undertones, there are some HYSTERICAL parts to it, too.  Kevin Spacey is such a great actor-- the audience is such putty to him; he can make us laugh so hard, cry, or just sit bug-eyed at the screen to watch what he does next.  This was a great role for him, even though it's different from most of his other roles. Reminds me a lot of his performance in 'The Ref,' humor-wise.This movie will make you think- about everything.  Go see it, right now.",10,0,0,30 September 1999
Face_Off," Good plot, good characters, action a little overboard
","This movie was pretty good, all things considered.  Cage and Travolta did a great job in their extremely challenging double roles, and the plot was great!  The only complaint I have is 1) the action scenes are a little too long and far-fetched and 2) the scene where he is talking about taking his 'Face OFF' is extremely corny.  I can definitely see why so many people are raving about this flick... it combines the great attributes of a great, action-packed film with a good plot and good acting.  Enjoyable movie!",6,0,0,7 January 1999
The Usual Suspects," Intellectually stimulating, thrilling, entertaining....
","'The Usual Suspects' is my favorite movie of all time for a number of reasons:  1) I was blown away the first time I watched it 2) I can spend hours discussing it 3) I have watched it almost 20 times and I never get tired of it 4) I always find something new when I watch it.  Those of you who are disillusioned with the movie because you can't completely grasp the plot, I don't think you realize that that's precisely the point of the movie.  After watching it once, go back over it and re-evaluate everything you saw the first time.  What is truth?  What is falsehood?  It never fails to make me think.  I appreciate that not everyone enjoys this type of movie, but as movies go, this is an EXCELLENT one, which, after viewing, made K.S. my favorite actor, Keyser my favorite villain (I definitely have a thing for villains!) and this movie my favorite movie of all time.",10,0,1,5 January 1999
The Game," Love that multilayered stuff
","Great movie, although quite disturbing in a number of ways, beginning to end.  Psycho concept.  That song 'White Rabbit' by Jefferson Airplane had a totally different significance to me after watching this movie.  Suspense effect is great.  Deliciously nightmarish and scary.  Some of the situations aren't perfectly developed, and the ending just makes you go... well, *@#$.  And you're kind of mad for a minute, and then you rethink everything.  And I just eat that kind of stuff up.  Very creative movie.",8,0,1,30 September 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," loved everything everyone else seems to criticize...
","When I was doing my Linguistics 101 final project this year on Speech Synthesis, I found a reference in a source to HAL of 2001.  Not more than a week later, I was watching it on laserdisc at Uris Library (at Cornell FYI), fascinated by every moment.  This is not a movie to rent with a bunch of friends and poke fun of the whole way through--  there is so much that can be missed that way.  But I have to say my favorite kinds of movies are this type:  the type that are best viewed alone, in the dark, and uninterrupted (I actually watched 2001 in two segments since the library closed at midnight!).  There is so much to discuss and describe and think about after you're done watching the movie-  no way possible to list it all here!  I could tell how much I liked it, though, when I found myself bringing it up with people often in conversation  ('Have you ever seen 2001?  Well, remember the part...') There are an infinite number of interpretations possible, and that, I think, is what best can describe this classic. Definitely watch it, but don't expect to enjoy a light, quick watch-- because it's so much more.",9,0,2,8 January 1999
Titanic," I wish that thing would sink already!
","Titanic was one of the movies we walk into and know the basic outline of the plot before even taking our seat and watching the lights dim.  The Titanic is a legend, and it was an interesting idea to make a movie out of the true drama it was.  However, the poignant relationship between Jack and Rose failed to faze me at all; the whole ironic situation at the end affected me little.  I couldn't really empathize with such sappiness; I felt like the characters and even the whole 'tough love' story were unnecessarily cliche. Also, it took WAY too long.  Over an hour could have been cut while still making the point.  However, I think the scene with the musicians, and the scene with Andrew staring at his clock were quite sad and well-made; the rest of it is probably not worth the $2.00 rental fee.",4,2,3,5 January 1999
The Iron Giant," Evokes emotional response like no adult movie can...
","...but maybe that's just me.  This movie rocked.  It made me laugh really hard, and all the jokes were clean!  I saw this movie with a 5 year old kid, and it enhanced my experience so much just to hear him laugh at the funny parts and to see his eyes widen at the huge metal robot.  But enough of the dialogue is designed to keep the adults' attention that you don't have to be a child or have a child to enjoy it.  A nice, simple message that everyone needs to have drilled into them over and over again, and the robot is SO COOL.  It makes me want to go out and buy a toy.",Null,0,0,15 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," THAT was Donnie Wahlberg?!!
","Okay, maybe that shouldn't be my one-line summary.  I did walk out of the theater dazed, having laughed, cried, and screamed, and feeling a similar kind of shock-filled awe that I hadn't felt since the first time I saw.... Usual Suspects.  Wait a second, Usual Suspects.  The similarities are a little TOO striking.  Is this thing ripping off my movie?  I don't mind that so much--it's what works.  Since that type of thing hasn't really been what you could call 'overused,' I'm okay with it.  What I'm NOT okay with, though, is this movie scoring higher than Usual Suspects, because on originality alone it did not.  Think about it, would you have given the movie such a high rating if it had ended differently?  And you can only give so much credit to an idea that so obviously has been recycled.  But enough diatribe on that.  Beyond that, the movies bear hardly any resemblance to each other.  'Sixth Sense' is much more of an emotionally touching film ('Usual Suspects' neither is nor tries to be emotional).  And in spite of my bitterness, I did like the movie a whole lot.  A WHOLE lot more than I expected to--the preview made it look even worse than Bruce's last 'child-helping' film (something about a computer virus, right?)  I don't think Bruce has been this good with a kid since 'North.'  Anyway, the kid completely shone.  I can't wait to see more of him in the future, he's amazing.  And.. back to the summary line... THAT was Donnie Wahlberg?!  Are you KIDDING me?!  Donnie the 'New Kid?'  What?",Null,0,0,20 September 1999
Back to the Future," I love it too!
","This is one I grew up with.. I've had it on tape since I was little and I love renting all three every so often and watching it all the way through. The characters, the funny little lines, everything contributes to this great movie!  I could go on and on... but I won't, I'll just leave it at the fact that I'll always love it!",8,1,2,8 January 1999
