Spartacus," Effective swords and sandals film although not to be taken as history
","Really a film at two levels.  Kirk Douglas and chums clad in designers slave sack cloth take on the might of Rome, while two great classical actors - Lawrence Olivier and Charles Laughton -  grapple politically for control of the Roman state.  Around both sets of characters moves the not inestimable Peter Ustinov as a trainer of gladiators. Implausible as it may seem, the film works at many levels. The writer and director both suffered during the McCarthy communist witch hunts in Hollywood and their experiences are allowed to come out during the film.  Many are not aware of the way most of those persecuted, as well as those who associated with them,  were black listed by Hollywood.  Kirk Douglas showed some guts both in using the duo and in allowing them so much free rein.  This said, the film does not suffer for this input in any way. The suffering of the two gives a strong air of reality to the picture.The film has three action scenes, the Gladiatorial contest being by far the best.  This is an impressive piece of cinema, where two athletic actors stage a fight to the death for a group of half interested Roman nobility. The ultimate battle starts well with the Roman army marching up in a massive chequer board formation which then forms into a great useless square ready for Spartacus to break up with blazing log rollers. This aside the battle is still worth watching and it does finish as it really did. Only the ending lets the film down.  Do we really believe it was worth all the suffering to free one woman and a baby?",9,1,2,3 January 1999
Zulu," An unforgettably colourful depiction of a great moment in British history slightly spoiled by artistic licence
","Driven by a majestic musical score the film rises to a terrible finale where the brutal killing power of Victorian volley fire is stunningly portrayed. it takes an hour for the film to get going, but this is partly forgivable given the first rate cast who hold our attention.  unfortunately, a significant part of this hour is taken up with the rantings of a hysterical preacher and his daughter, both of whom were nowhere near the fight.  If this is bad, the character assassination worked on private Hook, the hero of Rorkes Drift is disgusting.  The man was a fine example of the Victorian professional soldier, but he is depicted as a drunken, wife abusing, malingerer, skulking in the hospital.  The British army would not have given him a medal with that background if he had fought off the Zulus single handed.  On top of this, an awful lot of 60's philosophical hogwash is put in the soldiers mouths.  Some of the soldiers must have spun in their graves with dismay! The fighting when it comes is brilliantly staged.  Only 600 Zulu extras were used, but the careful camera work makes it seem as if the original 4000 are there on screen.  Colourful beyond describing, the battle builds to the same ponderous magnificence of John barrys spare, but telling score, totally gripping throughout. John Ford once said words to the effect 'If the legend seems more real than the truth, print the legend'. This film illustrates the point.  The 24th South Wales Borders had been fighting bush wars in Africa for a long time, yet they are shown in parade dress.  The mealie bag barricades at the real Drift were much more formidable than the flimsy stacks shown in the film. At some points the Zulus have to wait for someone to come and stop them climbing over the bags.  And nobody mentions the fact that Bromhead - Michael Caines character was stone deaf.  An excellent reason for Chard to take command. Was this a glorious page in British history?  The Boers held us in contempt for it.  136 men went into the fight and a third became casualties.  The Boer settlers took on the entire 50,000 Zulu army and BEAT it, with no appreciable loss at Blood River.  Oh well! Print the legend. All this aside, it is a glorious piece of cinema and must stand high in the Panthenon of great action movies.  Much of the dialogue is outstanding. 'He's a Peeler 716. Come to arrest the Zulus!'",Null,0,1,21 January 1999
Tombstone," A western with style and atmosphere
","What were the full time critics on about?  This is a really good picture, full of interesting characters and blessed with some clever scripting by a writer who has studied the period.  When will the people in the film industry realise that films should be entertaining.  Give me a film like this over Costners Wyatt any day. Set piece encounters abound and are original.  I can't remember any other film where gunfighters square off by quoting Latin at each other.  Or where some cracker barrel philosophy is so well done.  The whole enterprise reeks of the atmosphere of the old west. Kurt Russell makes a good Earp and even looks like the real man.  For a change, the two Earp brothers have life breathed into them by the actors and Val Kilmer puts in an excellent performance as Doc Holliday.  This is not a perfect film though.  The romance between Wyatt and the actress fails dismally to interest (maybe some of it was lost on the cutting room floor) and the events following the Earps departure from Tombstone are rushed and patchy as if the film was finished in a rush.  What is left is still a good picture! Wyatts slow despair,  Doc's plummy language, Johnny Ringos soulless killer, the reckless Curly Bill and the music. Bruce Broughtons score is a pleasure to listen to and progresses with the storyline.  Although one very good piece of music is thrown away on the Earps arrival/departure vis Tombstone, Wyatts theme develops slowly as the luckless man is drawn inevitably toward the very destiny he fears and despises.  Finally, the theme blares forth in all its tragic splendour as a now lonely figure of Wyatt Earp stands alone in the midst of the carnage of the OK Corral, outlined against a western sky where even the clouds draw attention to him. Great! The relationship between the two killers Holliday and Ringo is excellent, with a slightly unsettled Ringo trying to handle the fact that he is being stalked 'Let's play for blood!'. If more westerns had been like this the genre would not be unpopular today.",Null,0,0,31 January 1999
