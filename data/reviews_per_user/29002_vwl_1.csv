The Legend of Bagger Vance," Cheese-o-rific
","Whoo-ee!  You'll walk away from this movie reeking of cheddar.  The acting was mediocre, the cliches running fast and loose.But on a more philosophical note, did anyone else notice the connections between this movie and the _Bhagavad Gita_?  As it happens, I was studying it in school when I saw this movie, and was struck by the similarities. Bhagavad = Bagger Vance.  Arjuna = R. Junuh.  Vance gives Junuh the help and advice he needs to win; Krishna gives Arjuna the advice he needs to do his duty.  Does anyone else see this, or is it just me?  Send me a line!",Null,3,5,19 June 2001
