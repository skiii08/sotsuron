Raiders of the Lost Ark," Back to Elstree
","RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARKDirector Steven SpielbergElstree Studios Cast IncHarrison FordKaren Allen A great joy to watch Mr Spielberg at work.. The whole sequence was set out on storyboards. A master of his craft There's about twenty of the chaps dressed up as (It's that word again) GERMAN'S. And it's near the end of the film where the bad guys find The Ark and all us bad guys are going to get our just desserts. When The Ark is opened strange things start to happen and strong winds and sand are blown all over the set. Steven tells us to react to strange ghost like creatures coming out of the Ark. He'd point at us and shout above the noise of the wind, ''It's coming for you now react, now it's got you round the face, react to it.'' George Lucas was standing next to Steven at times and seemed to be enjoying the action. Harrison and Karen were tied to a stake at the time so I couldn't get any help from that quarter Of course all the special effects are put onto screen months later as is most films these days I read Steven Spielberg's life story and he didn't always have it easy. (Read it) And the last word on this tale must go to Harrison Ford's stand/in Jack (Chalky) Dearlove, who is still working for himHello Jack",Null,0,0,18 March 2009
Top Secret!," The Train
","TOP SECRETDirectorsJim AbrahamsDavid and Jerry Zucker Cast IncVal KilmerPeter Cushing I was booked for a couple of days to play a straight faced German and a very good actor (Warren Clarke) was to be my boss. The directors of this film had already shown their comedy worth with all the Airplane films in the USA.. So it was gag after gag in this film too. I don't know if this was Val Kilmer's first leading role but he certainly went to the top in his later films..The scene I'm in goes something like this. Warren is checking Val's papers on a train and this is set during WW2. After the dialogue scenes between them Warren and I get off the train and wait for the train to pull out.. We stand on the platform. The train doesn't pull out, the directors think it's funnier if the platform pulls out instead. (British Rail should make note of this as it saves on crowded trains.) Warren and I did work together again over the years.",10,5,8,19 March 2009
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A week at Elstree Studios.
","1977STAR WARSDIRECTOR GEORGE LUCAS After finishing a couple of Doctor Who's Central Casting sent me to E.M.I. Studios to work on another space film for seven days. I did ask them if they had any other work because I was fed up with wearing space outfits and the like (Little did I know about STAR WARS). There must have been about fifty Supporting Artists gathered on the first day, some putting on white space type suits, some being fitted out in weird make up and costumes and the rest of us waited around to see what we were going to be.We had plenty of time to sit around chatting and playing the odd game of cards. When myself and a chap called Ronnie Conrad got a call to go to the wardrobe dept, They dressed us in black space type suits but without a face mask(Were they telling us we were ugly enough to look like aliens). When we were dressed we sat at the back of the set and waited to do our bit. I got talking to a giant of a man (Dave Prowse) from the West Country and he told me he was playing a character called ''Daft Ada''. I found out later that day he was playing ''DARTH VADER'' (It must have been Dave's strong Cornish accent that made it sound wrong). Ronnie and I did some odd bits during the week and then the 2nd A.D. called for us to do a bit of business with our old mate ''DARTH''. We were going to arrest Princess LEIA (Carrie Fisher) Carrie's parents were Eddie Fisher (singer) and Debbie Reynolds (singer/actress). Debbie starred in the film ''Singing In The Rain'' in 1952 and I, as a twelve year old, was in love with her... (It soon passed). Anyway lets get back to ''DAFT''.Darth, Ronnie and I walk along some corridors and then into the cell where The Princess was being held. Darth had all the lines to say while Ronnie and I stood there looking ugly. (Typecast) In between lighting the set Carrie was very chatty and asked what else we had done in films. (Has she got that much time to spare?) I also met Harrison Ford and was to work with him again over the next few years. Star Wars was the highest grossing money film that I ever worked on. Some say it took a Billion Dollars at the box office and video sales Twenty five years later I am held in deep respect for being one of 'DAFT ADA'S' men, by my Grandchildren Thanks Mr Lucas",10,1,1,16 March 2009
