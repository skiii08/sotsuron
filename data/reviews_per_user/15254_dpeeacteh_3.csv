Blade Runner 2049," Visually Stunning, Boring as Hell
","Even though the movie is amazing to the eye, great atmosphere, great cinematography, and so on... The lack of a good plot is incredibly noticeable, I won't say it's a bad movie because I'll be lying, but I was expecting a ton more for a nearly 3-hour movie. Extremely slow and I'd say it has too much unnecesary fillers. You wait all movie for something great to happen but it never does.I bet only people who are top fans of the originals enjoyed it as it is.",4,7,14,31 October 2018
The Witch," It may not be for you
","I don't hate it; I don't think it's a waste of time, but here are some things to consider before watching it...
Is it something new? Yes. Is it tense? Yes. Does it have good ambience and acting? Yes.
Is it as good as everyone says? Definitely no.The plot of the movie had potential to grow strong, they just didn't execute it right; the movie gets longer as you watch it, not exactly boring, just not intriguing enough.
The main reason why this isn't enjoyable (for me at least) is because you wait the whole movie for something interesting to happen and it never quite gets there; there are 2 or 3 strong scenes, a bit of tension in them, but they do not do much in favor to the rest of the film.Maybe I got my hopes really high or something, idk the hype was big. It's not a bad movie, it kinda depends on why are you watching it. I'd say for sure it's not entertaining, maybe for artistic points of view.",4,2,3,29 December 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Truly Awesome
","Fully loaded with action sequences, beautifully shoot; great acting and great plot (the one that we already knew). Didn't think they could make a remake this good but they achieved it.
It's good in any way that I can think of. The only thing that doesn't quite keep the good job is that the plot is more around Furiosa than it is on Max, but hey I can't lower my rating because of that.
Enjoyable for the whole family.",10,0,1,31 October 2018
