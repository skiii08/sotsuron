Million Dollar Arm," Feel Good Flick!
","Million Dollar Arm (English): No, this isn't 'Slumdog Millionaire', though it has got some shades of it. Based on true lives of Dinesh Patel and Rinku Singh, the famous baseball pitchers, this Disney film has got the heart along with the thrills and chills. The problem with the film is the second half which gets slightly melodramatic, but overall it is a feel-good film added with humour, patriotism, emotions, loaded with brilliant performances by John Hamm, Bill Paxton, Madhur Mittal, Suraj Sharma and especially Tzi Ma, Darshan Jariwala, Pitobash and who are riveting, then comes the cinematography by Gyula Pados where the wide shots, the Indian mood and even the game has been beautifully captured, the music score by A. R. Rahman which is narrative complimenting, excellent and somewhat better than 'Slumdog Millionaire' in my view. Overall, director Craig Gillespie's narration in this sporty film is simple, slightly slow in the second half, yet sweet meant for a must watch. My rating would be: 4/5.",8,4,10,9 May 2014
Gravity," Great Cinematic Venture
","Gravity (3D), First Day and First Show: Indeed one of the finest science fiction films till date, which has a canvas like Steven Spielberg and a story structure whose first half has the shades of Stanley Kubrick's '2001: Space Odyssey' and the second half has the shades of Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' with an over melodramatic touch in between and flaw in the editing that could have been crisper. The film score full marks with it's brilliant cinematography by Emannuel Lubezki, production design work by Andy Nicholson, visual effects work by Tim Webber and his team of 'Framestore' and Richard Baker and music score by Steven Price. George Clooney and Sandra Bullock do great justice to their roles and add life to the film. Overall, director Alfonso Cuaron succeeds in delivering a great, yet not excellent film worth watching only on 3D for a great life experience. My rating would be 4/ 5﻿",8,1,2,14 January 2014
Grudge Match," Enjoyable Fare
","This sporty, entertaining yet warm film from Peter Segal, is a great outing with the two legends Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro which scores with its original screenplay by Tim Kelleher, Rodney Rothman and Doug Ellin, which shows the best of the rivalry and the punches within the film's developmental graph, the supporting cast (Kevin Hart, Alan Arkin, Kim Basinger , Jon Bernthal and others) that are warm and humane, adding great support to the protagonists. Then last but not the least, comes the riveting and killer performance by Sylvester and De Niro whose chemistry and charisma are actually the shining points of the film, making it worth a watch. The film becomes draggy due to its emotional overdose in between and even the editing lacks the slickness, especially in the pre-climax portion, but rest of all, it's a perfect weekend getaway for Hollywood lovers for sure! My rating would be: 4/5﻿",8,0,3,14 January 2014
12 Years a Slave," Terrific!
","12 Years A Slave (English): The film which yesterday had won the Golden Globe Award for the Best Motion Picture (Drama) and also, which will be releasing in India next month, is indeed an all and all well directed film having shades of directors like John Ford, Steven Spielberg and even Quentin Tarantino. The film has a screenplay by John Ridley, based on the book by the same written by Solomon Northup in the 1860's on his encounter with the slavery that makes you bind as well as bite your nails and even sympathize with the circumstances shown in the film, then the cinematography by Sean Bobbitt not only captures the best of the slavery and brutality but also reminds us of the camera-work as we saw in the film of John Ford. The production design by Adam Stockhausen, costume design by Patricia Norris and even the sound design by Leslie Shatz and Bryan Arenas are simply perfect to say the least. In the performances, Chiwetel Ejifor, Dwight Henry, Kelsey Scott, Scoot Mcnairy and rest are simply riveting and convincing as well. The cameo by the film's co-producer Brad Pitt is also worth cherishing. A great 'Great Escape' kind of fare, making a must watch. My rating would be 4.5/5. ﻿",8,2,4,14 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Great one, with few clichés
","Wolf Of Wall Street (English): Well, director Martin Scorcese's magnum opus is indeed an engaging flick undoubtedly with a good narrative, but the director who literally converted the 1962 Satyajit Ray directed Bengali hit 'Abhijaan' into the classic 'Taxi Driver', this time puts up great amount of 'inspirations' from the Mani Ratnam's 2007 Hindi Classic 'Guru', despite the film's screenplay based on the book by the same name written by Jordan Belfort. The low points of the film lies in its additional dose of explicit as well as emotional quotient which actually make the film draggy in the second half especially. Rest of all, the film scores because of its screenplay by Terrence Winters which has a good developmental graph and some style factor too, based on the Classic Hollywood style narrative, then comes the production design work by Bob Shaw and Ellen Christiansen who brilliantly showcases the best of the times, then the music score (Various) which have been well placed in the film. Then we have the brilliant characters having grey shades and adding great support to the protagonist and his moves, the comes the splendid performance by Leonardo DiCaprio who carries the film well on his shoulders and he continues his brilliance and then the narration by Scorcese, which makes the film engaging and worth a watch too! My rating would be: 4/5.",8,1,5,2 January 2014
Inside Llewyn Davis," Classic Indeed
","Inside Llewyn Davis (English): This Classic film (in my opinion) which won the Grand Prix Award at the Cannes Film festival 2013 is indeed one of the best films coming from the Coen Brothers, based on the struggle of a young singer who overcomes obstacles and makes his way as a popular American Folk singer. The film is actually a pure art house outing where the music score by Todd Kasow and various is based on the music played within the film and is indeed great. Then the production designing by Jess Gonchor and team brings out the best of the '60's in the film, the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel is worth cherishing as he paints every frame beautifully, then comes the great characters especially played by Oscar Issac who delivers excellence on screen, then Justin Timberlake, Carrey Mulligan, Ethan Phillips and others at their usual best. Overall, with an initial slow pace and then picking up the pace within its progress, the narration by the Coen Brothers makes you just lost in its musical fold, making it worth a watch for Cinema Lovers. My rating would be: 4.5/5.﻿",8,0,2,14 January 2014
