Changeling," Lost and Hurt
","The role that Angelina Jolie plays in this movie is so strong, you feel the emotions this character must go through. You fully understand the idea and thoughts this mother had.The movie revolves around this one persons life and you see everything that impacts her from all sides and the suffering she feels.I was impressed with the costumes and makeup, it all just adds so well to the time that the these things all took place. You get a very strong feeling for what life was like at that time and how people were treated then.Angelina Jolie has such a strength to show so many powerful emotional feelings and can draw an audience in to feel every bit of it.",8,1,2,24 November 2009
Juno," Classy & Cute
",I enjoyed the film a great deal because it was classy. It took the lives of two very realistic characters and put them into a very realistic problem. The characters were believable and touched on subject's student's embrace these days in high school. The comedy itself swings around the lifestyle of living in a somewhat small town vs. the larger city lifestyle. Where everyone knows everyone and everything you do so nothing goes unknown. But the main character has a funny way of dealing with all the issues at hand with her fast pace humor or quick jokes. So no matter the situation it seems nothing will ever be a let down. Life is never simple as it goes though and even when things seem as perfect as can be things can change on you. Through the strength of true friendship and trust along with the deeper understanding of love one can find ways to over-come what burdens the heart. You can find that with time problems can be resolved with careful planning and discussion. In the end everyone found their rightful place to be with lessons well learned.,6,2,7,6 February 2008
Cloverfield," What's Out There?
","To me a good movie is the kind that leaves you wondering what's going to happen next. Something that makes you thinkwhat would you do if you were in that situation? How would you re-act? I liked the film. I really only had one real disappointment with this film and that was the how it was filmed through the eyes of a single camera. Some-what like 'The Blair Witch Project ' thankfully our camera person in this film was much less shaky then that of the Blair Witch crew so you could actually see what was taking place as it was happening. The character build up was nicely done. You're quietly introduced into the lives of a group of individuals that at a perfect time were all brought together. If not for this moment some may not even have spoken to one another. Within a second everything changes and the city feels like it's become a war zoneno one even knows what's going on. You, as well as the characters are left waiting wondering looking around for a clue as to what happenonce the chaos starts. Earthquake, plane crash, bomb? What?",8,1,5,28 January 2008
Wanted," Sexy Action
","This was another great movie with Angelina Jolie, she is super hot in this one and plays a great wild and sexy character.I very much enjoyed the writers take on the office environment. The boss and cubicle mess. I think we have all experienced that working situation before.The movie is full of action and cool stunts / effects. You never get bored watching it.The movie also contains twist that one may not expect either. It's interesting to see how sides are chosen when the truth comes out. The music really helps build up the scenes too. Great sound track.",8,3,6,24 November 2009
The Dark Knight," The Jokers Smile
","I had high hopes for this film and I was not let down. The movie was drawn up with a strong cast of very good actors and actresses from the start.The mood of the Joker plays the perfect setting through the whole movie. 'Evil is best met with a smile.' Good and evil fight hard in this one. Life can make a person stronger or weaker. What happens is your choice,you can make it happen or you can leave chance to the flip of a coin.Ledger will be missed. I have seen several of his films. This was a great art of work for him. I don't think anyone could capture it quite like this.",8,3,7,20 July 2008
30 Days of Night," Dark & Cold
",I read the book first then watched the movie. The movie follows the book well. I enjoyed watching the movie come together from start to finish even though I had a good insight on what to expect.The movie leaves you thinking about what you might do in a place where your cut off from the rest of the world. Could you manage to remain calm in the dark for 30 days? The characters were interesting and this does contain your classic Hollywood vamps you see in other movies. This will be a good horror movie to watch for those who are looking for something a little different. Its got a little action and suspense with a twist of dark romance.,6,1,1,20 July 2008
