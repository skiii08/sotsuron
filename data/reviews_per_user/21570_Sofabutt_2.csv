Marie Antoinette," Yawn
","Spare me.Don't go see this movie. Instead: watch A Knight's Tale and go to wikipedia and catch up on the facts behind Marie Antoinette.The real sad thing is, there hasn't been a movie, starring Kirstin Dunst, before now, that I had absolutely NO interest in seeing. Let's get real, it's about a French Chick: nothing makes me want to vomit more than anything French, be it mimes, Dijon, Escargo, whatever. All things French should end up in a bloody mess jammed down the garbage disposal.I guarantee seeing A Knight's tale in combination with a visit to wikipedia will more than make up for seeing this piece of junk.",Null,3,11,28 September 2006
Van Helsing," Kill yourself instead of watching this movie.
","Movies can not get worse than this cheesy pile of dog stain. If you're a man, the only reason to see this movie is the starlet and the hot vampire chicks. If you're a woman I am guessing it is for Hugh Jackman.If someone rents this movie and asks if you want to see it before they return it, take note, because this person should never be trusted with a movie rental card, free movie coupon, or be allowed to sit home alone - unless the gas is on. Anyone who would recommend this movie is not your friend, and has nothing but ill intent towards you and your family.If this movie somehow gets in to your DVD library, promptly remove it and place it under a glass or soda can where it rightfully belongs.Someone was playing a cruel joke when they cooked this steaming pile up and served it to the world.",1,3,6,24 August 2006
