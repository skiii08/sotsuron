Skyfall," Bring Back The Real James Bond
","I went into the theater with such high expectations & when I left I was disgusted with the film. Yes, it is an okay action movie but it is NOT a 007 film. The last two movies have been bad but this one is so much worse. If your a true bond fan you will more than likely be disappointed with this film. It holds no elements of a Bond film. It's missing all the KEY elements that all the other Bond films have, like the other reviews have posted, there are no gadgets, no girls, no plot, no humor.They bring in a young Q & he issues James his gun & a radio transmitter & then has the nerve to make fun of gadgets & says that they have done away with gadgets. I thought he was joking! How can it be a Bond film without at least one gadget?! Throughout the film I kept thinking, 'They would never do this in a real Bond Film or That would never happen in a 007 movie!' The girl? Where is the girl, where is the romance? They spend 5 minutes on a girl then she gets shot in the head & he does nothing about it, doesn't even blink an eye. The ending, since when does the villain get what he wants? The villain wanted M dead & that is what he got. Bond didn't save the day.This film is just sad. I really keep hoping that the next film will be a real 007 movie but they keep messing it up so badly. The film critics that gave this film good reviews should be ashamed of themselves. I have come to the conclusion that Bond is DEAD, they will never make another good film.",1,35,65,12 November 2012
