Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What was george thinking?
","Okay people lets admit it to ourselves... this movie is terrible. This is a god-awful downright bad movie. If this movie wasn't directed by one of the greatest Directors ever and part of the greatest Sci-Fi movie series ever then it would have been laughed at and out of the box office in a week. I love Star Wars and george as much as any man but i slowly came to realize this movie was terrible.The plot was thin and implausible, the characters were stodgy and unimaginative, and Lucas even managed to take good actors like Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman and produce bad acting. And for those of you who think that Anakin wasn't that bad for a child actor and that there aren't any good child actors then i guess you never watched 'The Sixth Sense' or any of the children in 'E.T.' (which i will remind you George Lucas played a major role in creating) AND THEN they add Jar Jar Binks to the movie, putting the metaphorical nail in the coffin.This terrible movie is made all the worse because it wanted to live up to the greatness and grandeur that was the original trilogy. The only thing this movie is good for is for its DVD to be used as a blunt object to hurl at George Lucas' head.I'm making a public plea to George Lucas, you ruined the first prequel and the second was barely any better. Give up the final movie and let a still-competent director direct it. Please, I can't see another episode of my most favorite movies ever shot to pieces.",Null,0,1,13 August 2002
Memento," A Whole New Kind of Movie
","This truly is a great movie.While i wouldn't qualify it as a 'difficult' movie to watch I would say that you need to watch it beginning to end (or rather end to beginning) with no bathroom breaks, while paying close attention, because the complex storyline is the most important part of this film and if you miss out on a part it could be ruined for you.It's true that some people will never 'get' this movie but its definitly worth a viewing, and if you do 'get' it then are you ever in for a cinematic treat.THis movie in and of it self would be very good if it were played in the standard beginning to end format, simply because of the facinating aspect of the main character having no memory, however the decision to make the movie run reverse immensely helps you relate to the character by not allowing you to know any backstory, as if you yourself had the same memory disorder.I'm about to go watch it again and i suggest you go watch it to...",Null,1,2,14 July 2002
Pitch Black," Stop Kidding Yourselves
","I must admit that I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be god awful and quite frankly a joke, and I'm surprised and pleased to be able to say that it was neither. But when people claim that it is complex and cutting edge they are simply kidding themselves. This movie is simply a particular well done modern 'B movie'. And lets not pretend that Vin Diesel portrayed a deep character with conflicting emotions, etc. Vin Diesel's performance was decent and utilitarian; just because the writer called for him 'not to talk most of the time' doesn't meen that he should get all this credit for possessing some incredible eye for character psychology.The overall plot is the absolute standard scifi: land on alien planet and discover some horrible secret through the people who are there or the remains of the people who died there. This has been the default scifi plot since the earliest scifi days and is probably the plot for 4/5 of all Star Trek episodes. Although the concept of the staying in the light thing seems reasonably original enough I will give the movie some credit.The inclusion of the 'unique characters' like the Muslims is hardly ground breaking. The writer simply needed to include a mystic/religious grandfather figure (the main muslim guy) and some fodder for the monsters to kill before they started killing the real characters (the muslim kids with him). [Admit it, you knew from the beginning that those annoying kids were gonna die.]However the movie is worth seeing, just ignore the standard scifi plot holes and try to forget that some of these reviewers said that Vin Diesel is a good actor. [I love ol' Vinny D. more than you know but I admit that he is a terrible actor.]",Null,0,0,30 April 2003
