The Blair Witch Project," Great film!!
","One of the best psycho/horror/thriller flicks I've ever seen. Fantastic cinematography. Seeing everything from a '2D' camera point of view was the clincher for me. You could only see what would fit into the single perspective of the camera lens. At the theatre, a lot of people were disappointed by the ending.  I gave it a 10 and recommend it highly to those of you that like the more bizarre type of thrill.",10,1,2,15 August 1999
