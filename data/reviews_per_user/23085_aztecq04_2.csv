Come and See," Remarkable!
","A remarkable war film so different and so intense as no ordinary work can truly be. It is an experience and a unique approach to show a part of humanity affected by a horrible war, a war not only on the outside, but deep at the heart of human emotions. The lively and atypical sequence of the story rather than plot driven has touched me profoundly. The portrayal of suffering is very vivid because we see, we smell, we feel as if we were there. Florya finds himself in the middle of growing up and consequently the rapid worn out of his life caused by the horrors of the war. We see him age so quickly in front of our eyes and with the sound, it makes it more haunting. To lose your mind, to age so so fast is just unbelievable. The long take shots and the very realistic actions leaves us in awe. It is a trauma that in the end doesn't really have an ending, a film that could always have the same impact anywhere, anytime.",10,2,2,9 June 2008
Ran," Amazing !
","Ran, a very interesting film by Akira Kurosawa. Although I had never seen anything of this sort, it is important to say that what caught my attention right away was the colorful taste of the scenes. The bloodshed went along with the color for it increase the dramatic take of a scene. This also helped the foreshadowing such as clouds and rain present at various parts of the film to imply the coming of a battle or a big event. Betrayal and the pursuit of power are the main recurring ideas. The battles between brothers for the place of the old father built into a non-ending killing of each other. The role of each actor is very unique, not only because each of them has a determinant role but because they do it very well. Even when the film is based on King Lear, it does take a life of it's own making it more unique.",8,0,2,9 June 2008
