Iron Man 3," Boooo! Very disappointing! Unsatisfied! I feel so cheated!
","All I can say is if you know or are familiar with Iron Man and the villain Mandarin in the comics, you will be very unhappy watching this film.It was such a huge disappointment. Such a big bummer that the Mandarin was not portrayed like in the comics. So, so sad. The story would've been incredible if it stayed true to the Mandarin character! I thought the movie was going well until it was revealed that the Mandarin was just a decoy. Then, it was downhill from there. And Pepper beating up Killian at the end? That was kind of corny, I thought. Not thrilled with that idea either (and I'm a woman, by the way).So, from one comic book fan to another: don't go watch this film if you're already having a bad day because it will only make you feel worse. a lot worse. And if you're having a great day, definitely do not go watch this film unless you want to end your day on an unhappy note. Maybe you can wait to watch it when it comes out on blu-ray (by renting or borrowing it, of course).",3,6,13,5 May 2013
