Vertigo," Best Movie Ever Made
","I'm not going to be able to say anything about this that hasn't already been said but I recently decided it was my favourite movie of all time.Evidence for claim:It's the only film I've ever watched twice in a row (as in: rewind the tape to the start as soon as the screen fades to back and press PLAY)Vertigo deals with love as obsession - one of the best definitions of Love and one I (worringly) tend to adhere to.That soundtrack. Herrmann's most moving, haunting and disturbing score. I kept replaying the opening credits just to listen to the music. I play it in my head at least every other day.It was underrated in its day by almost everyone - usually the sign of a masterpiece (anything by Kubrick)and too many others qualifying arguments to list.First time viewers might want to be advised about the pacing in the first half - it is purposely slow - but the second time you see it you won't notice because you'll be in the 'dream' that much quicker.",Null,7,9,28 September 2002
