Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good installment to the Star Wars Saga
","Star Wars Episode I The phantom Menace is a good installment into the Star Wars universe.  It is, in my opinion, about equal to Return of the Jedi, but not as good as A New Hope or The Empire Strikes Back.  I think that this is a film that we will learn to appreciate a great deal more after we see Episodes II and III.  Right now we are viewing the film alone, which is really unfair.  This is really just a set up movie.  A set up movie obviously can not be as interesting as it's predecessors.  If you read a good book it's first chapters are not as interesting as the middle chapters. When I head about the prequel trilogy I was not expecting to be guessing what would happen next, after all, I knew how it would turn out.  How wrong I was.  I now find myself wondering how things will happen, even more so than I did with the original trilogy.  How will Anakin turn to the dark side?  How will Amidala die?  Why did Obi-Wan and Yoda disappear, but not Qui-Gon? Although the relationships were not developed in this film as much as they were in the others, I feel that this will be further developed in the future films.  I thought that the four main actors did a fantastic job. When I first heard that Ewan McGregor was going to play young Obi-Wan I'll admit, I had my doubts.  They were all put to rest when I saw and heard him on screen.  He sounded almost identical to Sir Alec Guinness in Star Wars. Natalie Portman played a double role extremely well.  She brought a very human touch to Padme, and a very regal feel to Queen Amidala.  Liam Neeson played a rebellious Jedi Master well.  And Jake Loyd, contrary to what early rumors said ('Mannequin Skywalker'),played a very good young Darth Vader. The actor appeared very innocent, which will make his turn to the dark side even more powerful.  There are a few hints at his future fate though, like his hard glares at Mace Windu in the Jedi Council. As for the much debated comic relief character, Jar Jar Binks, he is not a racist stereotype.  I firmly believe that Lucas had no bad intentions while creating the character.  If anyone sees the character as racist, they are going in with a pre-conceived racist view.  I think the character, whom many regard as annoying, had a potential for disaster.  However, he was handled very tactfully.  The action never centered around Jar Jar's comic actions.  A prime example of this is when Jar Jar is juggling the pit droids.  Instead of making a big deal of this Qui-Gon simply keeps walking and says 'Come on, we're going.' In all, I'd say that this is a very good installment into the Star Wars universe and worthy of the 'Star Wars' name.  The action is great, and the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The podrace and the jedi duel is amazing.  Although the lightsaber duel is not as emotional as the ones in the original trilogy, it is the best physical battle of all the Star Wars films.  John William's score is fantastic.  This is a very good film that does what a good film is supposed to do, keep you guessing.  You will find yourself, a few days later asking yourself, 'I wonder how Anakin will turn to the dark side?  Will his mother be killed?  Will Amidala leave him?  I can't wait for Episode II.'",8,0,0,14 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," After all is said and done ATTACK OF THE CLONES is an enjoyable film that improves upon EPISODE I, but still leaves much to be desired.
","Computer Generated Imagery (CGI to those who haven't been living under a rock) is a tool, not a means to create a film.  George Lucas needs to realize this; because not only would it give his films a more realistic quality but it would remedy many of the problems that plagued EPISODE I, and unfortunately carried on to plague the latest installment, STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  Don't get me wrong, I loved EPISODE II, and I think that many of the problems from EPISODE I were improved upon, however many were not.  But, I digress, let me discuss a little of the positive. First of all, the movie was much better than EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE. The story was more complex, the acting was better, the tone was darker, and as many fans requested, Jar-Jar Binks was reduced to little more than an important cameo. This you can all see for yourself when you view the film.  Let me go into more depth with the negative, which is often a little more difficult for the die-hard STAR WARS fan to pick up on at first because they are so overwhelmed at seeing a new Star Wars movie on the big screen. (I know, I too loved EPISODE I when it was first released).  The vast majority of the problems with ATTACK OF THE CLONES are the result of abusing the power to create images digitally.  For the last half hour or so of the movie you can easily forget that you are watching a live-action movie and think that you are watching WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT PART II.  There are a handful of live actors interacting with CGI characters in a CGI world, and the result is very distracting.  Christopher Lee's character, Count Dooku, riding a speeder (in front of a blue screen) looks like the Wicked Witch riding her bicycle in THE WIZARD OF OZ.  This is the first time that our little green Jedi friend Yoda is created entirely using CGI techniques, and we end up losing a substantial amount of his character.  Even if you can't quite place your finger on it, you can tell that something is definitely amiss.Not only does CGI look bad, but it can have a huge impact on the actors. It is virtually impossible to get the same reaction from an actor who is acting in front of a blue screen as an actor who is acting in front of a fully functioning set or location.  The actors end up feeling ridiculous, and can not convey the feeling of actually being in danger, or awe, or whatever the scene may call for.  This results in more than a few scenes where the actors simply appear to be bored to be there.  Lucas has become so enveloped in how the movie looks that he has forgotten why the original films were so endearing; they had real characters that we could relate to and cheer for. Admittedly, though, the actors did do a better job this time around, a big part of that is the fact that the story doesn't revolve around a ten year old actor.  Ewan McGregor, the saving grace of The Phantom Menace, returns and is still the most likable, as well as most believable character.  He is an inspired choice to play the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his enthusiasm, if not his simple presence is felt as a positive thing.  On to Hayden Christenson as Anakin Skywalker, who did a better job acting than I thought. Although I did feel like he gave a stronger performance when he was playing the more dramatic scenes than when he had normal conversations.  I did not feel any chemistry between him and Natalie Portman, though.  Their relationship felt very contrived and I did not believe that they were in love.  Not enough happened between the two of them to suddenly realize that they loved each other at the end.  I am as big a Natalie Portman fan as any (probably bigger), but I do have to admit that she gave the weakest acting of all in this film.  Not until the very end does she give any emotion to us at all. Do I have any other complaints?  Yeah, just a few.  This film contains what could possibly be the two worst scenes of any Star Wars movie.  The first one comes when Anakin and Padme are `frolicking' in the field and Anakin is impressing Padme by riding on a creature with an enormous rear.  If you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about.  The second is C-3PO. Why did George Lucas feel the need to replace Jar-Jar Binks with our old loyal droid friend?  C-3PO has more than a few unnecessary puns in the middle of what could be a dramatic, if not overly computerized battle. For someone who liked the movie so much, I certainly have a lot of complaints.  This was a very good Star Wars movie, but possibly not a great movie in general.  This is, possibly more than any other in the saga, a film for the fans.  They will delight at seeing things that they have only heard about begin to transpire.  We get to see Anakin begin to look to the dark side as Palpatine councils him, as well the tension between Obi-Wan and Anakin begin to form.  We get to see a substantial number of Jedi in battle as The Clone Wars begin.  Oh, and then Yoda gets into a little scuffle. This movie also has enough allusions to the original trilogy to keep a STAR WARS fan happy for days, and the foreshadowing is laid on thick.  This movie defiantly will keep the Star Wars chat rooms full, as fans wait anxiously for EPISODE III. You can't help but wonder though, was EPISODE I really necessary?  I mean it didn't advance the story as much as one would hope, and even still after EPISODE II, with only one movie remaining, there is a substantial amount of story left to tell.  Hopefully Lucas will learn his lesson and make the final installment as worthy of the STAR WARS name as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is.  Unfortunately I fear that we have more CGI in store and not so much character development.  Lucas is a good storyteller, but not such a good director.  I only wish that he would let a new face direct these prequels. After all he did not direct THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK or RETURN OF THE JEDI.After all is said and done ATTACK OF THE CLONES is an enjoyable film that improves upon EPISODE I, but still leaves much to be desired.  We can only hope that these desires will be fulfilled when we all go stand in that wonderful long line in 2005 to see the final chapter in the story of our favorite tragic hero, the one who will eventually bring balance to the Force, Anakin Skywalker.",Null,0,0,23 June 2002
Toy Story 2," Even better than the original
","Is it possible?  Could any computer animated film be better than the original Toy Story?  Apparently it is possible, because Toy Story 2 surpasses even the first Toy Story.  I went into Toy Story 2 expecting a good sequel...but what I got went beyond my highest expectations.  I saw a funny, emotional, beautifully animated film gem.  Be alert for references to numerous film classics such as Star Wars, Jurassic Park, 2001: A Space Oddity, and more.  Toy Story 2 is actually one of the best films that I have seen this year, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  Toy Story 2 joins The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, and Superman II as being one of the few sequels that is even better than the original.",10,0,1,21 January 2000
Vanilla Sky," A hypnotic, dream-like two and a half hours with a soundtrack straight from my CD collection
","This is by far one of the most amazing films that I have ever seen.  Rarely does a movie take you through such a variety of emotions.  This is by no means your typical, run-of-the-mill, mainstream Hollywood movie, like you might be expecting.  At first glance the typical movie-goer may notice that this film is from the director of 'Jerry Maguire,' and also stars Tom Cruise.  But this is no sappy love story about a sports agent, this is so much more.  From the advertisements, one can pick up that this film is an erotic thriller, which it is for the first 2/3rds, then it suddenly shifts gears and becomes something much more powerful.  To tell anymore would detract from the overall experience of this film.  The problem with most audience members is that they are not expecting this sudden shift away from the mainstream, and they do not keep an open mind about them.  Admittedly this is not a movie for everyone, in fact most of the people in the theater with me hated it.  I heard comments like, 'I don't get it,' and 'After Mission Impossible 2, I expected something good out of Tom Cruise.'  If you are only open to mindless action like 'Mission Impossible 2,' or sappy Oscar friendly stories like 'Jerry Maguire,' then 'Vanilla Sky' is not for you. However if you are looking for something a little different, then this movie comes highly recommended.  This is a movie that left me with a 'buzz' afterwards.  It is a film for people who are dreamers, for people who like music and pop culture, for people who enjoy a smart film, and for people who are only secretly optimistic about life (in-the-closet optimists).  The film making is so straight-forward, which is the genius of Cameron Crowe.  From his first feature, 'Say Anything...' this is obvious.  He is straight-forward and has the ability to create characters that are endearing to us.  Not to mention, he can incorporate music into his films like no one else (his semi auto-biographical film, 'Almost Famous' gives us a good idea why)is a wonderful example of this.  'Vanilla Sky' is no exception, the sounds tell the story just as strongly as the images.  When R.E.M.'s 'Sweetness Follows' came on I became so wrapped up in the movie that I almost forgot that I was in a theater with a couple making out beside of me. The soundtrack is like Cameron Crowe picked CD's from my collection. With artists like R.E.M., U2, Radiohead, The Beach Boys, and Bob Dylan you can't go wrong.  So in conclusion, go see 'Vanilla Sky' with an open mind, and be prepared to be amazed.",Null,0,0,19 December 2001
