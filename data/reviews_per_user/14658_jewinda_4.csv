Requiem for a Dream," The film-making quality is secondary- this film makes you FEEL
","Often hype about films lead to disappointment and after waiting 14 months after release for my local cinema to show this film, I was done thinking about it. Thank goodness too, rather than challenge my brain (not hard to do unfortunately) this film went straight for the heart, ripped it out and kicked it around the floor for 90 minutes. As the addictions plunged further into the depths of Hell, I felt myself more and more arrested by the film. I've never left a film shaking or feeling physically ill- not including Pearl Harbour, of course :)  You want to look away, but cannot.This movie is by no means flawless, but then again I would like to hope that the flaws add to the gritty reality of the film. The ending was truly the most frightening thing I have ever seen in film- forget the cheap scares of The Exorcist, Psycho and the endless bile of the 'slasher flick', this stuff is REAL.In a country amid a 'war against drugs' this is a powerful film which could do more to turn kids away from drugs than any measly government 'task-force' or classroom lecture.",Null,657,800,18 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," WARNING!
","First off, let me say that I didn't mind the original three films.  I even tolerated Phantom Menace.  But Attack of the Clones was an over-rated, morally pretentious, poorly acted, nauseating pile of rubbish.   Hayden Christensen should never be allowed on a movie screen again.",Null,0,1,8 June 2003
American History X," Edward Norton and the Cinematography in this film are absolutely fantastic.
","This was a very thought-provoking film. If Derek could turn into a frightening skinhead so easily, what's to say that your next door neighbour couldn't change just as easily.  While this was an excellent film overall, there are two main aspects that need to be singled out.1) Tony Kaye's cinematography was absolutely brilliant.  There are few movies that I have seen lately that have used so much innovation in its shots. 2) Edward Norton was robbed of an Oscar when it comes to American History X. He is perhaps the most underrated actor in Hollywood and his convincing portrayal was flawless.",Null,0,0,3 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," The ending wasn't THAT good...
","The problem with reading the reviews of film critics in the newspaper is that they ruin too much.  Had I not sat through The Sixth Sense knowing that a 'big twist' was coming at the end, I may have actually been surprised, maybe even satisfied by the ending.  Despite the letdown, this was a worthwhile film. If you can, see this film at the cinemas... the chilly atmosphere was awesome.  There's nothing finer than when you and the audience share a collective gasp of fear! This was perhaps the most scary film I've ever seen and the performances by Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette (both deserving of Oscar nominations)were outstanding.  Bruce Willis as well puts in a great acting performance (Yes...Bruce Willis and acting ARE in the same sentence).",Null,0,0,15 October 1999
