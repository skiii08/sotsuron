10 Cloverfield Lane," terrified girl fights the unknown.
","10 Cloverfield Lane. It begins by dragging the audience into personal issues from the main character and it gets the audience hooked into what its about. Later on the plot continues and the main characters stories get told.The first half of the movie is very drawing and makes you curious about whats to come, Unfortunately the last half was disappointing and very anti-climatic. Going from a zombie apocalyptic world involving safety and survival tactics into an alien invasion with the outcome of one individual being able to take on unknown species on her own and destroying that which would take more than you would think. 10/10 worst movie. Such a waste of money. Don't invest in watching this movie.",Null,5,11,18 March 2016
