Angels & Demons," Rather dumb, but an enjoyable thriller
","Requires suspension of disbelief, but there is some enjoyment to be had here. The race-against-time story is engaging, and while the whole 'trail of breadcrumbs' series of events that the film sets up does not make sense if you devote it a lot of thought, it is still entertaining. The heavily religious backdrop is cool, and while a certain plot twist feels very silly and contrived, I believe that many will find some enjoyment in this thriller.",6,0,0,31 January 2019
The Incredible Hulk," Disposable entertainment
","Nothing unique or different to see here, but still enjoyable.Edward Norton's iteration of the character is really the heart of the film. His portrayal of a determined and gentle individual, who simply wishes to put a stop to his condition, is easy to sympathise with. His relationship with Liv Tyler's character is also very sweet; there is an interesting dichotomy in Hulk's furious rage being motivated out of wanting to protect the woman he loves.I didn't care much for the villains portrayed by William Hurt and Tim Roth, and I found that the film often dragged during their scenes. There are three large action sequences, the first and last of which I thought were generic and uninteresting, but the other one I liked.In my opinion, a slightly underrated instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",7,0,0,9 December 2019
The Expendables 2," Better than the first one
","Whilst I didn't exactly adore 'The Expendables 2', it did improve upon a lot of what I didn't like about the previous film.The story is significantly more intriguing, though still very bare bones, and not exactly original. The locations feel much more exotic and unique. A lot of the characters are still not memorable, although at least the team dynamic is stronger here; whilst the first film felt like people kept coming and going, this one mostly keeps them together as a tight unit, giving the supporting characters more screen time and emphasizing their comradery. The direction of the action is also stronger; much more coherent than the first film, with more imagination behind it as well.Whilst it isn't terribly memorable, it is a decent action flick.",6,0,0,4 July 2020
World War Z," Messy, but not irredeemable
","The film starts off very messily, with underdeveloped characters and an incoherent edit. It feels as though so many scenes and characters have been cut down drastically, and pieces are missing. However, World War Z improves in its last half (and especially last third). The re-shot ending feels much more coherent, complete, and interesting.Overall, while the film is very undeveloped and disjointed at times, there are some great set pieces and moments, and the ending is strong.",5,1,2,25 October 2019
Knives Out," From someone who was underwhelmed with The Last Jedi
","I found Rian Johnson's Star Wars film to be disappointing, but I believe in going into every movie with an open mind, and I really enjoyed 'Knives Out'.It's an intricate mystery story that feels clever, witty, and made with a lot of passion and care. An early twist in the plot puts this film on another level, distinguishing it from other murder mysteries and making it a unique experience. The characters are very distinctive, and the brisk pace means that the 130 minute runtime is never boring. The theme of self-made success is also beautifully explored.I found the ending to be slightly rushed, but overall, the film comes across as funny, smart, and unpredictable, all at the same time. Would certainly recommend giving it a watch.",8,9,30,24 November 2019
The Expendables," Completely hollow and overflowing with tired cliches
","I sat down, ready to watch a fun and simple action flick. I was disappointed.The main draw to this film is obviously the cast. There is meant to be a novelty in watching all of these legendary action heroes team up on screen. However, I never really felt like the film pulled this off. For starters, some actors have very little screen time, including Rourke and Willis. Other actors also were very sidelined, and I never felt like the team dynamic was really there. I wasn't convinced at all that the characters had been friends for years, despite the film's pretense of such.In general, the movie is incredibly cliched, without actually being entertaining. The mission, the heroes, the villains, the romance, all of it. It's very empty.The action is fine, I guess. It's there. There are some cool shots and moments, but it mostly isn't filmed or edited very well, and just sort of washes over you.Overall, disappointingly forgettable.",4,0,0,30 June 2020
Pacific Rim," Big, hollow and boring
","I personally found this to be a dull experience. Some of the action and visuals are quite impressive, but there isn't as much action as some may want out of this sort of movie, and the characters are very uninteresting, resulting in a film that feels rather empty.",4,1,2,4 February 2019
Now You See Me," Messy, bloated, implausible and perfectly entertaining
","It's light, fun, slick and fast. At times, it does feel like there is too much going on, and it's a bit hard to follow. Additionally, there are several implausibilities, including a silly final twist. However, I really did enjoy myself.",8,1,1,27 October 2019
American History X," Tedious and drawn out, with underdeveloped character arcs
","Yes, Edward Norton is great, and the cinematography is interesting. Yes, there are some highly effective and powerful moments. But ultimately, I wasn't entertained by this film.The story heavily involves Norton's character, a former white supremacist. I was utterly unconvinced by the reasons the film gave as to why he changed his ways. I never found myself believing that someone so adamantly spiteful and prejudiced could so easily reverse all of his attitudes, and change his outlook on life. Not to say that such isn't possible, but I didn't think the film was convincing enough.I felt like a lot of screen time was wasted. So many scenes came across as unnecessarily long; when the story tries to make a point or convey something, it spends more time than it needs to.I would've loved to have enjoyed it as much as others, but I ultimately came off underwhelmed.",4,1,4,13 November 2019
Unknown," Efficient thriller with some interesting twists
","A perfectly competent and enjoyable mystery/action/thriller film. Towards the beginning, Neeson's character feels rather uninteresting and bare, and the film comes across as a bit thin. However, the central mystery is engaging enough to pull you through the runtime, and I started to get more invested as the movie went on.The plot twists not only make sense, but take the story in more interesting and unexpected directions. While I'm not terribly inclined to rewatch it, Unknown is a perfectly efficient and entertaining thriller that passes the time well.",7,0,0,26 October 2019
The Da Vinci Code," A dull history lesson
","I enjoyed the first 10-20 minutes or so, but once the plot really kicked in, I lost interest very quickly. The script is long and bloated, packed with endless dialogue about history, religion, symbols, paintings, more history and more religion. A lot of it feels unnecessary and overdone. The trail of clues that the characters follow is slow and bogged down by all of these 'history lessons' that are fed to the audience along the way. After a while, all of the facts and clues just start to blend into one another.You feel every second of the 2.5 hour runtime. The silly and contrived twists along the way don't help either. I personally cannot recommend it.",2,1,3,21 September 2019
