Deja Vu," Predictable, but alright for brain-dead Thursday hours
","I'm not too fond of predictable Hollywood flicks, but hey, I had a free ticket so I thought I'd give it a chance yesterday evening, as I like going to the cinema and there wasn't anything else to see.It would be a lie if I'd say that this one wasn't predictable, at least not in my humble opinion. One could figure out most of the flick pretty fast, and besides the plot, I even found the scene development to be too familiar with the typical Hollywood touch to it; a girl facing herself in the mirror while wearing only her bra on top, the implicit promotion of certain ideals and industries... well, you know it. It kind of makes me wanna throw up, but anyhow... it wasn't too difficult to blindfold oneself for these kind of things and just focus on the plot, as the flick kept a quite decent pace. Even though by judging what's written above might draw one to an easy conclusion that I wasn't fond of the flick it all, I must emphasize that it was after all a quite good brain-dead action. I mean, a flick like this one doesn't require too much of one's concentration.6/10",6,0,1,29 December 2006
Dawn of the Dead," A good tribute
","The original Dawn of the Dead felt too bad to make a remake of at first, but when I heard that it was only going to be a tribute with a little more budget than the original - I just couldn't believe my ears and after seeing the trailer I just had to see this piece at the cinema. Once off to pay a visit at the cinema due the rain, we we're settled down in the seats of the cinema to watch the tribute to Dawn of the Dead. I got very surprised by the movie itself, since it were not a real 'splatter', but it were not like a total rip-off from 28 days later neither. It was a good mix up with some flesh exposure together with heavy combats, and it had all those spices I like in a zombie piece like this. The best is that they add a little bit of comedy to it, who makes it even more deep and playful along the road - not only rabbit hunt with the shotguns. 7/10",7,0,0,4 July 2004
Hostel," Beautiful scenes but that's it...
","For what reason I do not know, I've been trying to avoid this flick for a while due to the bad reviews I've read and heard about it. So it came the other day that I had the chance to see it and I took it. I'm not really disappointed, I guess I didn't expect too much of it, did I? For the plot, the build-up didn't really move me at all. I was more amused with the beautiful scenes being depicted in the latter part of the flick, which are quite dark and for some reason the scenes brought my thoughts to the Dark Ages, don't ask me why.I was heavily annoyed by some of the lines in the flick, which gives a subtle boost to prejudices about Europeans and Americans and to what is supposed to be 'seperating' us. I'd rather see the flick without this generalizing crap lines, but they're there so let's try to forget about it and focus on, again, the beautiful scenes. 5/10.",5,0,0,20 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Generous voters or?
","So finally we managed to go and see this movie at the cinema. I didn't know what to expect. Some reviews I've read recently generally compared the output to Lord Of The Rings, so I had some expectations for sure. I felt quite, well, like someone had stolen my cookie after the movie ended. It was all OK till about the middle of the movie and the plot development to me was a little bit too slow perhaps but still OK. Somewhere after passing the mid part of the movie I felt that the plot developed all too fast. And all of a sudden the movie had ended. What happened? For sure there are great effects here, both visual and audio, but the plot just developed so quick in the end. It felt like the director realized after filming and completing the first 1Â½ hour that he had only one hour left to go and he had 2/3 of the story left to tell, so he tried to find some kind of compromising middle path and it didn't please me. It's a cosy movie and fully OK worth its playtime but hey, by judging the voting here makes one wonder if people's been extra generous with the points due to its Christmas times...",6,1,2,2 January 2006
Hot Fuzz," Simon Pegg and Nick Frost bring more British humour to our big-screens
","I first saw Simon Pegg in Shaun of The Dead (2004) and I have to admit that even though I enjoyed that movie, Simon's face did not become etched into my memory. I will definitely remember his face after seeing Hot Fuzz, however, and he is one superb actor, that is one thing for sure.Hot Fuzz brings British humour to the big screen, a kind of humour which I find really enjoyable. Simon Pegg plays a fine police officer who cleanses London from perpetrators in the most satisfactory way, which turns out to be too satisfactory as Simon becomes promoted and then transferred to a small city situated in the English countryside. Although this peculiar city seems to be peaceful and has numerous times won a sort of annual 'greatest village' competition, the city seems to be stacked with a great number of original characters of who all of them seem to be law-benders to some extent. Simon Pegg's law-abiding character thus faces a great challenge as regards enforcing the law in this peculiar city.This film is well-executed comedy mixed with mystery, and if I was not a fan of Simon Pegg in the past, I am certainly one now. Fans of Shaun of The Dead will most likely enjoy this one and perhaps some fans will be attracted to Hot Fuzz simply because Simon's friend and side-kick Nick Frost is featured in this film, too.I think I must see Hot Fuzz a second time. At any rate, this film is well-worth a 7/10 from me.",7,0,2,4 August 2007
My Neighbor Totoro," Spellbound by Totoro?
","We saw this movie at our last Japanese lesson we had at school for this semester. I hadn't seen it before (the anime-freaks looked doubtfully at me) and as it is a Studio Ghibli piece, I had quite a good feeling about that this was going to be a good one (as the vast majority of Ghibli's works are so neat). I must say that the story was sweet, and there is some kind of magic woven in here, enhancing the movie in some way, putting a smile on your lips for sure. I can't really point out anything specific that I got really hooked on, but there were something with the atmosphere I believe. A solid 7/10 well worth seeing for the whole family. Am I the only one that got spellbound by the character Totoro? Hopefully the anime-freaks have a bit more respect for me now.. ;)",7,0,1,11 December 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," No pro-American manipulation
","With large expectations on this piece, we settled up in the cinema to enjoy two wicked hours of awesome visual effects and amazing audio. As the movie sort of takes focus on the U.S.A, I got a bit worried that it would be another pro-America movie (for example, Black Hawk Down et cetera), but my conclusion now after enjoying the premiere show of this piece, it wasn't any pro-American stuff! It was just two hours with a good message to all of us out here and there, well sort of everywhere! I found  this movie superb when it comes to effects, and the story ain't that bad either. I give it a 7 out of 10, and it's well worth those two hours of action. VIVA LA GREENPEACE!",7,0,0,27 May 2004
Silent Hill," Tasteful scenery
","First, I should point out that I can't really identify myself with the group of people that adore the Silent Hill video games. I've just tried out one of them and I was quite impressed, but I'm not really much of a gamer these days. So I thought I was in a quite good mood for a movie like Silent Hill tonight, and I can't say I got too spellbound by judging the plot... Although I think the scenery was amazing! I'm a bit interested in art and this flick just had what I'm into, that sort of morbid and doomsday kind of feeling to it. For the action and the acting, I didn't get too involved... I mean, it was just another American flick, considering the acting and the Hollywood style. But hey, it was two hours of good effects, so the time watching it wasn't completely wasted. I give this 6/10, where at least 4 points are earned just by the scenery.",6,1,3,23 October 2006
Nacho Libre," Well worth a shot
","I found this piece to be very weird to tune in to at first, but once I got in the mood I found it to be hilarious at times. The jokes have a sweet, sort of surprising approach and with, at times, a darker touch. I must admit that I choked a few times out of laughter. Jack Black's character ventures into some utterly weird projects, and with his companion, they're forming an excellent pair whose future adventures are anything but easy-going. I must emphasize the beauty of the scenery in this flick, as the surroundings are giving it a certain magic touch.I must definitely get into some more of Jack Black's stuff after seeing this one. 6/10 - well worth a shot.",6,0,1,5 January 2007
Closer," Weird!
","I had a movie session with my girlfriend a while ago, and we happen to stumble upon this piece of movie. It was her choice, and I know that I hadn't picked it if I had to choose. :-) Anyhow, this movie starts out rather weird and it contains a lot of jumping in the chronology, which was quite easy to follow for me (even though I thought it was quite weird) but my girlfriend was facing a hard time at times trying to follow the jumping in the chronology. Natalie Portman makes an excellent performance here (as usual) and really blends this movie. The performances by Jude Law and Clive Owen are OK, but I think that Julia Roberts makes one of her less good performances here.The movie didn't really turn out to be an awful movie as I first expected by judging it from its first 30 minutes, and I have to admit that it settled a weird feeling in me that it was somehow OK, but I didn't really like it at all. The piece contains a few surprises for the analytic trying-to-predict freak, which were to my pleasure. But generally this weren't something I connected well with at all. 5/10, and those 5 points are just because of the neat acting here.",5,0,3,14 August 2005
The Italian Job," Awesome!
","This piece is absolutely splendid! For the very first time I actually enjoyed the role that Mark Wahlberg was playing! And with the crew of Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def and with the beautiful Charlize Theron, this just makes it all awesome! The whole piece was based on the movie with the same title from 1969, and this proves that old pieces does not have to be bad pieces (as I'm afraid too many of you out there still claims) - with some new effects and some up to date characters this could be the actual hit in the world of movies in 2003. If you like speed, quick and intelligent comments (conversations), beautiful girls and some speedy chasing, this is the piece to look at. It reminds pretty much of a Luc Besson movie, the touch and the climax of it, but with more quick comments used in movies such as 'Snatch'. Action! Lets go!",7,0,1,30 April 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," More touchy than the previous movies
","I'm sort of ashamed of myself as I haven't really seen this piece until now. I were in a good mood as I began to realize and feel during this movie that this, the last episode in the trilogy, is by far more touchy and deeper than it's previous episodes. It was way more focus on love and hope - the two senses that never a machine can achieve by any artificial intelligence what so ever.I feel a bit like I'm split into two main thoughts about this. At one way or another, it feels like it's more fast and quick action here for the ultimate survival of the war, but on the other hand it feels very focused on the previous mentioned things, love and hope. I don't know if it is perhaps that the movie is balanced well, or if it's just two extreme opposites that finally blows both sides out. I do feel split, but in a good way. I've heard so much bad stuff about this piece, but I don't agree. It's surely worth it's time!",7,0,0,18 April 2004
The Village," Surprisingly good
","I just got home from the premiere of 'The Village' - and guess if I got surprised! I've read and heard people talking bad about this piece, but oh no, this one is surely splendid! You just have to experience it at the cinema! It's a very good story and original as well, combined with some good acting from actors we often see having small roles in other movies, except for the one playing Noah (who's really impressive in 'The Pianist'). All is good, really. I'm into horrors and I usually never get scared, but this one made me jump in the chair a few times at the cinema. Gosh, it's great! Go and see it and judge by yourself - the ratings are poor guidance! :)",8,0,0,25 August 2004
American Psycho," Psychotic ultra experience
","'American Psycho', with its plot and with Christian Bale, is just one full on madness experience. I love it! Christian Bale is superb in this movie, and there's not words enough to can explain to anyone at the IMDb boards how great he actually is here. The movie delivers full on madness killing sprees, and the closer to the ending credits roll you come the more psychotic both Bale's character 'Patrick Bateman' and the movie as whole will get. Violence, sex, drugs and more violence are the main ingredients here, so if you like movies with such subjects, see this! I just have to read the novel after seeing a movie of this caliber. 7/10 is my vote, but it's a vote close to 8!",7,0,2,19 July 2005
The Shining," Yes it is a classic, but so is also the book...
","I suppose I'll join the group of people who've read the book before seeing the film and who's a great of Stephen King's novels, so I suppose you may get a hint of where I'm heading. 'The Shining' as a book is a masterpiece, probably the best King novel out there one can get if you would ask me. The film however suffers from, as more or less all films based on novels do, a lot of 'keys' that I think is really important for the whole plot. I won't give any spoilers here, but Mr. Kubrick, whose works I adore, gives his own interpretation of the novel and he has a few tricks in his pocket for you here in case you believe that you've read the book and that'll leave you out of surprises - well you're wrong. Jack Nicholson (Jack Torrance in the film) makes a crazy performance here and if anyone should be closed within rubber walls, he's the person for it. He makes his role perfect and he succeeds in spreading psychotic vibes. I'd really like to make this a bit of critical spoiler, but I won't, so I sum things up with that I recommend reading the book before seeing the film. Yes, the film is a classic and I like it for sure, but so is also the book who I love. Kubrick's done as well as he possibly could I believe, it is hard to squeeze these 500 pages into 140 minutes without having to cut much of the plot or reorganize things, so this is a masterpiece itself (but once again, so is also the book). 7/10.",7,0,1,14 January 2006
"I, Robot"," Had bad expectations but got surprised
","As I've heard numerous rumors about that this movie was a two hour commercial, my expectations of 'I, Robot' weren't that good. But I admit it, I got surprised! The movie starts out pretty bad, as I guess here's the part where all people whine about the commercial thing. OK, it wasn't that good, and flashing around with Audi, Converse et cetera, well please Will Smith stop flashing around for the money and go back to what you used to be. Making some conditions and terms! Not only in it for the money... But still, I like you Will, and you're acting does not turn less good as the more you only work for the money. It looks like you need some vibe back again, maybe return to the Fresh Prince, haha. Well, anyways, this movie ain't that bad, so I'd call it a 7 out of a 10, and I'm really satisfied with how the story develops the further the movie goes. Well worth the view!",7,0,0,24 August 2004
Edward Scissorhands," Very touching story
","As always, Johnny Depp are awesome as in all other pieces he's been involved with and 'Edward Scissorhands' ain't no exception. I was sort of surprised, it all starts pretty much like a comedy to me, to later on develop into a really touchy story. I'm very impressed by Tim Burton, this is truly a masterpiece. The way Edward is played, reminds me pretty much of the main character in 'Donnie Darko', and I just love it. The good thing about this piece is, that it ain't disturbing the mood too much after seeing it, still you feel very touched and like you've been through a so much longer story than you really have (105 minutes feels like 3 hours, in a good way). Seeing this ain't something I regret, thumbs up for this piece!",8,0,0,26 March 2004
Van Helsing," Too much action - lack of story
","After being served for nearly two hours of constant action, I could finally relax and breath. 'Van Helsing' is filled with constant action, wicked combats, endless effects loaded together with some quick comments. I do think the whole movie started up well, but the more it developed the bigger the lack of story got, and the more action I was fed with. I think they went to much 'Matrix' here, and lost the very important balance between having a good (deep) story and having awesome scenes of combat. Anyways, I experienced this piece at the cinema and I think that is a big plus, at least that is my conclusion. With all those visual effects and the astonishing audio experience it must be experienced at the cinema (or perhaps at home with some awesome audio equipment). As my head still feels a little wicked and as I probably haven't really melted the piece yet, I still think that 6 out of 10 is a fair grade for 'Van Helsing'.",6,0,0,13 May 2004
The Machinist," One of the most weird pieces I've seen in a very long time
","I were at the local video rental place yesterday with my friend, and this piece caught our attention. It turned out to be a really good choice! After seeing it, I made the conclusion that I had been kind of 'stunned' for 85% of the movie, due to that it was really hard to keep up with the story but I did percept that this was the movie's intention to do. The Machinist is a really original movie and if you thought that you liked schizophrenic movies like 'Fight Club', you'll love this one as well.This piece does easily score 8/10 for me, and I must admit that I was really mentally tired after seeing this. With this movie, it seems that even David Lynch gets a rough time beating this piece in level of weirdness.",8,7,11,18 July 2005
Saw III," A bit more gore than in its predecessors
","We went to the cinema yesterday to see this flick. I can't really say I had any expectations, I mean, it's a third part in a series and such are rarely keeping the same quality as their predecessors. After seeing it, I have to admit that this flick is definitely keeping the same touch of quality work as the first two parts. I'd say it's better than the second piece, and if it's not better than the first piece, then they're at least even.I found the third part to have a bit more gore in it, compared to the other pieces in the series. Some scenes are really disturbing and even I, who claim myself to be quite difficult to disturb through film as a medium, at times felt really... well, it was almost a bit too much. It's far from snuff, please, don't get me wrong here, since the utter disturbance is very beautiful in a way and very artistic, I'd say.For the plot, I can't pull off any complaints. Anyone familiar with the first two pieces and the plot of theirs, will recognize the atmosphere and the touch of the flick here. The acting is neat, no complaints there either. All-in-all, this is a well-made flick and among the best deliveries from Hollywood I've been confronted with in quite a while. I recommend it. 7/10.",7,24,39,11 December 2006
Spirited Away," One of the best animes ever
","We went to the video rent and hooked up with 'Spirited Away', a film that both my friend and I have heard lots of good rumors about, that it's supposed to be one of the greatest animes ever - and who could've disagreed when there's Studio Ghibli who's in the work of the production. This piece starts out rather smooth and takes a quick roll into the story - and we're about to follow a little 10 year old girl who's entering a new realm, a new dimension of magic. I just love the vibe this piece brings, and it's really a Ghibli production! Well worth the good voting points at IMDb, and I suppose this really is one of the best animes ever, I can asure you it is in the top 5. Tune in, turn on, drop out - and enter the world of Chirio! 9/10!",9,0,1,6 July 2004
The Butterfly Effect," My head feels like a frisbee
","Wow, as I'm writing this just right after I've seen this movie, I'm needless to say as I feel that my emotions speaks for themselves for me: I'm thrilled and deeply touched by this true masterpiece! I just love the way Ashton Kutcher acts in his role, and the whole story itself feels very original. I could never guess what would happen next, as I was watching and could not move a single muscle due that I was so much into the story. Sometimes, it feels like life could be fast and you wonder how the story will be if you've would've made a different choice at a different time. Maybe I would've still been with my ex, maybe I wouldn't be studying here and perhaps I would've had a job instead somewhere. This film just gets my mind going, I think I need to meditate and focus on this piece more than just two hours to actually melt it, and let the story become a part of me.
See this, as I think none of you out there would regret it. 9/10",9,1,3,6 May 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Better than expected
","Finally it has arrived - Alien versus Predator - the story where the two races who's been setting people in fear for a decade finally meet. My expectations were not that positive. I hoped it would be worth the 90 minutes watching it though, and it does feel a little bit like a 'must see' movie, since if you're born in the early eighties you're grown up with the Alien series and the Predator series. I was a little bit surprised by the actors list, but it mixed up rather well with this film. Overall it's worth it's 90 minutes of action, but it's nothing special or anything at all that I would buy when the DVD is to be released. But are you not up for anything special, take a hike or go to the cinemas for some slash and fight action that primary entertains supreme fans and young teenagers who's still into 'Power Rangers'.",6,0,0,23 August 2004
Hellboy," Not that impressive
","Well finally I was about to see the movie, with the most creative title ever - Hellboy. Since the ratings at IMDB was about 6.6, I hoped that this one would entertain me - even if it wouldn't surprise me. Neither it did, and it felt like two hours of wait to see the ending credits roll. OK perhaps not that bad, since it had some cool jokes in it after all. Perhaps this one will entertain you if you're really tired, suffering from a hangover or are just plain bored. I guess I'm folded into the last category, and even worse is that I'm probably more bored after seeing it than I was before it started. 4/10, and those 4 points are for the jokes and nothing more.",4,0,2,28 August 2004
Garden State," Weird but still makes it
","I had heard a lot of stuff about this movie before I went to see it, and lucky me the outdoor cinema in my city showed this piece about a week ago. I'm a great fan of Zach Braff and his acting in the 'Scrubs' series, and he didn't disappoint me this time either. Worthy to mention is his acting, who is quite different here and I perceive his role as a bit complex. But he completes his task well here, no doubt about it. Natalie Portman is great as well, and that in combination with Zach just makes this piece really good. The tension and atmosphere throughout the whole movie seemed a bit weird to me, but in a good and very original way.# START OF POSSIBLE SPOILER # I was a bit confused though, that the movie is, at least to me - pointless. But this is nothing that ruins the movie, oh no, but this is just not the everyday Hollywood movie (the guy loses the chick, makes everything to get her back and despite his foolish acts he succeeds in the end - then kissing screen and then the credits roll). The ending is sort of neat after all, but it's more of the kind that has to grow onto you and you have to let it melt in order to fully appreciate the piece and to complete the deep dive into the 'Garden State'.# END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER # Great movie, see this if you get the chance to!",8,0,1,12 July 2005
Grave of the Fireflies," Well worth the view
","Grave of the Fireflies is, probably one of the most touching animes I have ever seen. The story takes place in Japan during the end of the WW2 and we get to meet a brother and his sister, trying to survive during the hard times and misery Japan faced at the bitter end of the war. The anime, who is from 1988, feels like it's delivering an old vibe of the anime style, and with a smooth roll the story develops and tightens up into something you never would've imagined before you pressed 'Play'. Too bad though that I had such big expectations on this piece. I've heard it's 'so sad' and that you're about to cry for a lifetime, but hey it's a piece that won't get you to smile but it won't ruin your mood forever either! A 7 out of 10 - and it would've gotten higher points unless it didn't felt so short and empty of action from time to time.",7,3,15,27 July 2004
Saw," A good piece of entertainment
","'Saw' is a thriller I really enjoyed. It reminds me a lot of the old school superb piece 'Seven', but still it doesn't turn into some sort of spin-off. This is a movie who has a kind of original story who entangles its viewer. The acting is great, and some of the characters nearly freaked me out because of their neat acting. Danny Glover is superb, and Leigh Whannel as well! I did get forewarned that it might get too much at times due to horror scenes, but I was just bluntly pleased. :) Great piece and well worth the time!I recommend it to anyone who liked 'Seven' and anyone who's into psychotic horror thrillers!",8,0,1,18 July 2005
Stalingrad," Another b-war action from Germany
","Here we go again with another b-war action from Germany. It features the war and conflict of Stalingrad during the WW2, and I presume it requires germans to do it, to get rid of the 'constant-always english talking germans and russians'. Here we are presented to screaming russians, bloody  coats of germans, evil generals and hungry civilians. It starts out a little bit too slow and weak, but as I started to feel dizzy and tired about the piece itself, it slightly developed into some more action-filled story with combat scenes in Stalins pearl in the Sovjet Union, Stalingrad.If you don't have anything better to do and you like war with effects who's less expensive than effects in other war movies, such as 'Saving Private Ryan', well then I'll guess you can give it a shot. 4/10",5,1,14,15 May 2004
From Hell," Depp makes it all
","We rented this piece over at the video rentals, and we put it in the VCR to watch it with the only purpose that Mr Depp was in it. I just love Johnny Depp, and this piece ain't no exception to his masteracting. The piece starts out rather slow with more balance put to criminal stuff, nor than the regular Depp action I'm used to. But with all these small details, such as his use of absinthe and opium, just small details, all those pieces just completes the movie as whole. It makes it all slightly more real, no one is perfect and Depp always succeeds in playing those roles - especially when it comes to roles of users on illegal substances. Pure masterpiece with a good pace throughout the whole movie, and it's for sure a good time seeing it.",7,0,1,8 July 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino fever
","Quentin Tarantino's first masterpiece who was set to life, Reservoir Dogs from 1992, went off in our VCR the other day for a flashback to the 90s. I just love those wild quick comments, clever actions and how Tarantino brings everything back together and makes everything vital to the total outcome of the movie. I just love Reservoir Dogs, and the one who's claiming that this ain't an original piece ain't especially original him- or herself. This is Tarantino fever at high level, and there's no room for chill out here - high speed action and people armed to their teeth on a roll! Gather some friends, bring up the beer and tune in with Reservoir Dogs into the mysterious head of Quentin Tarantino! 8/10!",8,1,3,6 July 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," With the first The Matrix being a film creating a new style (maybe even category) it's follower, The Matrix Reloaded has surely been hyped to the max.
","With the first The Matrix being a film creating a new style (maybe even category) it's follower, The Matrix Reloaded has surely been hyped to the max. It was a terrific film containing the best effects and such from it's previous and those 22(?) month's of filming has shown to be well used.In my humble opinion, they've used these effects who was the ultimate in The Matrix all too much in The Matrix Reloaded. I mean these fighting scenes were awesome but still it was like, a little but too much of the good cake. After a couple of fights it felt like being on the dance floor with a discjockey finding a superb track among the audience and spinning it with a loop for ten times.The soundtrack will be great. I got very suprised when I heard vibes of progressive psychedelic trance and even more happier when Rage Against The Machine got loud when the ending texts was still in roll.Above all, I'm pleased and I'm looking forward to the last film in The Matrix-trilogy.",10,0,0,21 May 2003
Platoon," Awesome! Just simply awesome!
","Weird as I am, I'm very interested in history, and the Vietnam in special. By that, it made this piece a lot more interesting to me than other war movies - so I just had to see this one with my friend and discuss it afterwards. I found this Oliver Stone piece so tight, scary, dramatic and it sent this huge vibe that stroke me that, this was real - no fake action here ladies and gentlemen. I do believe that this movie gives a fair shot of how it might've been being an American trooper down there in those flood deltas, and the way Oliver delivers this story to the viewer it's simply amazing and stunning. No other Vietnam piece can beat this I believe, and the movie really shakes your brain around a little bit, and afterwards I felt cozy and very touched. It's just simply a masterpiece!",8,0,1,29 July 2004
Blow," A touching story
","I can't help being touched when I see this piece, I just can't. This movie just makes me depressed, and this is the truth, I believe it and since it's a drama, why wouldn't I..Johnny Depp is awesome as Mr. Jung and the way he plays his role reminds me of the movie 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. Fast action, quick comments and the best way of expressing feelings, just as only Johnny Depp can do it.I wonder what the odds of ending up like this are.. If the whole world really is like it's shown in 'Blow', what does that makes me.. Just being one of the people not being aware of the cocaine trading.. This scares me.See this movie, you won't regret it.",9,0,1,8 March 2004
300," Well executed
","I tend to like flicks that cover historical events so I thought I would give '300' a go. Before dealing with the plot, I must say that the featured scenery is first class. There is something special about the scenery that makes it sort of magic, as though there was some sort of mysterious magic filter processing the video content.I do not feel that I am in a position to press charges against any of the actors due to poor performances. Gerard Butler does his job great indeed acting as King Leonidas. What I do feel though is, that the flick unfolds a bit too fast to the point where the Spartan army finds itself at war with the Persians. At any rate, the violent scenes of the war are well executed and I found the balance to be decent between art and war.In conclusion, I give '300' a solid 7/10.",7,1,3,6 May 2007
Cube," Lost in maze
","I did enjoy this movie, all though some of the characters might get a little bit too overwhelming at some points, but overall it was a real success. I found the story also very unique and original, something that isn't all too common these days in general horrors. It was this sort of movie that you can't guess what's coming next, you'll just have to let your feelings be controlled by the movie and discover yourself being horrified and filled with surprise along of the movie's twisted journey.",7,1,3,19 February 2004
Sin City," Off to Frank Miller's world
","I saw this piece yesterday at the cinema, and I have to make clear to everyone that I have never been especially into comics by Frank Miller. I guess I have never really give it a fair chance. Anyhow, the piece totally stunned me. I love that the movie is generally in B&W except for some Technicoloreffects, and that really puts a neat 'comic feel' to it. I guess the editors captured the feeling of being exposed to a comic, as the whole piece really did feel like a comic, at times reminding me of the movie scenes in the PC game 'Max Payne'. I think that the story is told in a superb way, and the actors (impressive cast!) don't really surprise us, as we already now what these actors are capable of. See this today, you won't regret it! 8/10!",8,0,1,24 July 2005
Donnie Darko," Words are just not enough
","I had some expectations I must say when I turned this piece on, some of my fellow mates has spoken of Donnie Darko for a long time so I decided to give it a shot. And seeing this is something I do not regret at all.Donnie Darko is by far one of the deepest movies I've seen for years. I can't just compare it to any other piece, there are no words who are enough to express to the reader of this comment, how splendid this piece is. And it's not just deep, it's all very touching and I like being touched in this way. Seeing Donnie Darko is worth it's nearly 2 hours of runtime and if you haven't seen this one, go and rent it as soon as possible, take a break today from work and have a day of thinking. In some perspectives, this movie is a psychedelic piece to me, and I'm afraid I can't go more deeper into the subject without ruin some of the joy for the viewer.",Null,0,0,21 February 2004
V for Vendetta," Hypocrisy? Well, maybe...
","So there's been quite a fuzz about this flick so of course we had to go to the cinema and see it for ourselves. I can't really say that I'm disappointed nor am I very satisfied about it. One thing is clear though - the message of the flick is good, yet it feels slightly adjusted to reach a broad audience (which I suppose many flicks are intended to). The reluctant acting and agitation feels raw in a very 'cool' way, but in reality, which this piece is trying to draw a parallel to, it isn't really that 'cool'. Opposing the government is at times depicted as something necessary and 'right', whilst it at times becomes a little bit too much and I can easily see if some people may sound the alarm, crying out that this flick is filled with hypocrisy.So much for the message, what about the acting? Well I didn't get annoyed by anyone's performance. The scenery is at times stunning and very much fantasy like, which I find nice. All in all, I won't salute this piece as some others have. I feel it's a commercial flick that is perfectly timed with what is going on in the world right now, and it greatly benefits from the distrust of people who has grown tired of being fooled by their leaders. A good message, but it doesn't feel whole-hearted. 7/10.",7,1,3,2 May 2006
