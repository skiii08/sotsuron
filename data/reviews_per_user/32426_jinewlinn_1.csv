Alien 3," A disastrous sequel that should have never seen the light of day
","James Cameron showed us everything. Tons of aliens running around in bright light, right in front of the camera, and a giant queen alien to top it off.No matter what you thought of THAT movie, but after seeing all those aliens, the worst possible option for a third movie was to go back to the roots with a claustrophobic horror sequel featuring one small alien lurking in the dark. And guess what they did!!! Alien 3 was destined to fail - and fail it did. The 'suspense' moments with the alien did not work at all. It gets you from behind, cracks your skull open, pulls you up to the ceiling, well no sh*t! I've never seen that before! ;) The final thirty minutes with the alien chasing prisoners through endless corridors just drag and drag on forever. Maybe the writers should have spent more time on fleshing out the characters before pitting them against the alien! And why use rapists and killers as characters? Are we supposed to feel excitement, thrill, outrage, or pity when they are killed off? Are we supposed to feel anything in this frigid tale of bleakness and despair? I doubt it.Ripley's jump into the hot lead left the audience cold. Her death was predictable and meaningless, since we had given up on her character when she did, half-way into the movie. Her final leap into the bubbling cauldron was allegorical of the movie, if not the fate of the entire series, and a welcome end to a disastrous sequel that should have never seen the light of day.1/10",1,563,645,1 June 2008
