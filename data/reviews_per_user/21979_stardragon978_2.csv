Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Like Episode IV!!
","I think that the main gripe among Star Wars fans is the fact that Episode I is not like any other movies in the series. I happen to dissagree.  If you watch Episode IV you will see that it is only designed to introduce characters and not to develop them.  The development of the characters happens in the next two movies, that is why people say that Empire Strikes Back is the best of the original trilogy.  All Episode I is meant to do is to introduce characters that will be developed further in the next two movies in the trilogy.  I think that you have to give George Lucas credit for being able to develop such a lush movie in which to introduce his characters. And as for you people who hate Jar Jar I think that yes he is anoying but he helps give the movie a comic relief that was not seen in the original trilogy. What I am trying to say is not to judge Episode I too harshly until you see the next two movies!!!!!!!! Personally, I think that Episodes II and III are going to rock!!!",Null,0,0,29 October 2001
Dumb and Dumber," Worst Movie Ever!!!!!!!
","I realize that with a title like 'Dumb and Dumber' one should not be expecting oscar caliber performances. But this movie just stinks!!  NOt only was I offended by it, but I found nothing in the movie to make me laugh. In fact the first time that I tried watching this, someone else rented it, I fell asleep about halfway through the movie!  And the second time that I tried to watch it, my roommate owns the DVD, I fell asleep during the credits!",1,26,68,2 October 2001
