50 First Dates," IMHO, One of Adam's/Drew's Best
","I avoided seeing this movie for months until there was not really much else in my local video store I wanted to see so I reluctantly rented it. Just proves the old adage, 'Never judge a book (in this case a movie) by it's cover. Though I am not a big Adam Sandler fan (gross out movies turn me off) I found '50' to be a great movie with a beautiful love story to tell. The walrus gross out scene near the beginning had me almost ready to turn it off BUT I am more then glad the movie steered away from having more scenes like it and instead explored the love affair between Henry and Lucy. Henry's determination at winning Lucy's heat is a great part of this movie as is Lucy's tragic life altering event but love does conquer all especially when truth is allowed to express its self fully no matter how painful. They say the ending is the most important part of any story and this movie has a great one. Plus, as one reviewer has said already 'any movie that has a pivotal scene that hinges on a Beach Boys song is just alright with me'. All in all a great movie. If you haven't seen it yet do yourself a favor, avoid the sex and violence for one night and rent 50 First Dates. I am more then glad I did.",8,0,0,12 September 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," There is no way this movie could have been made any better.
","From the opening scene of Gandalf's ride into the Shire to Frodo and Sam heading off alone towards Mordor at the end the film had me riveted to the screen. Peter Jackson has done such a tremendous job with 'The Fellowship of the Ring' that it's going to make waiting a whole year to see the next installment very difficult. All my fears of how bad this movie could be were dashed in the first 5 minutes and I just sat back and marveled as the movie unfolded at how well Peter Jackson brought images and scenes to life that I had only been imagining for decades. All the demons of Mordor are realized in frightening detail (and ugliness) as was the naive innocence of the hobbits. All the great places of Middle Earth, The Shire, Elrond, and Lothlorien, are brought to life with breathtaking detail and beauty. This is a movie that needs to be seen on the big screen. A must see for all fans of Tolkien's epic.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Very entertaining and enthralling, a magnificent movie.
","To even try to hold this movie or the other two in this trilogy up to the standards set by the books is a fool's folly. No one alive can ever make these books into a movie while following the books exactly. Nor would the dare do so because to do so would be a career ender. Why, one main reason, no one would sit through the 20+ hours it would take because it would be so boring therefore making it a complete box office failure. So Peter Jackson did the only thing he could, adapt them to movie form. And taken as an adaptation this movie is magnificent in all respects. 3 hours and 20 minutes went by for me with barely a notice of the passage of time. The movie was both very entertaining (which is why one goes to see a movie in the first place) and enthralling (which is what one hopes a movie is when chosen out of all the possibilities on any given night). Knowing the ending in no way spoiled this movie for me because seeing my minds eye realized on screen so magnificently was pure joy. I was very careful not to read or hear any ones else's opinion before hand, which allowed me to see it untainted plus or minus and I was rewarded for it. Peter Jackson took on the daunting task of taking one this era's most prized and revered set of books and turning them into movies and IMHO succeeded. It must be hard being a purist, these movies our excellent unto themselves.",10,0,0,20 December 2003
