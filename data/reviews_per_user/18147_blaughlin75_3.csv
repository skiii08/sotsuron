The Hangover," This movie uses a formula that is rarely used in comedies
","This movie takes a familiar plot and turns it on its head. You don't see the bachelor party. You see the guys wake up with no recollection of what happened. Their hotel 'villa' where they wake up is trashed and includes a tiger, a chicken and a baby. The groom-to-be is missing. You don't know what happened and neither do they. You just know that something crazy happened. As the guys try to piece together clues to find their friend, they encounter the consequences of their crazy, intoxicated behavior. They are just as shocked as the audience as they encounter the people they dealt with the night before, when they unknowingly consumed a powerful drug. They have a strict time deadline to find their friend as the wedding is two days after the party, one day after the hangover. So every turn they take gets more outrageous since you don't know how they know these people that know them and either hate them and want to hurt them, or love them for reasons they don't know. Eventually, things start to add up, but only after the guys encounter situations that are completely bizarre. The guys are relatively stereotypical--the nerd who is whipped and uptight, the stud who has a bit of a chip on his shoulder, and the weirdo who makes everyone uncomfortable. None of them is ready to deal with the trouble that they created while drugged, so they are freaking out with what they encounter, and the audience empathizes with them because we all have had that night where we have done something we regret while under the influence. Only it seems these guys have messed with some really crazy people. This movie moves from laugh to laugh consistently, and you don't know how far it will go. The chemistry with the very different characters keeps getting better. At the end, you finally get to see what happened to set these events into motion. At that point, you realize these guys were just extremely drugged-up guys who were trying to have a night to remember and were so messed up that they did some pretty stupid things. This movie is great fun and a bit uncomfortable for those who have had nights where they have done things they don't remember.",9,1,3,14 June 2009
The Thing," The Thing excels at every level.
","This movie deserves mention amongst the greatest horror movies of all time. It hits the right note on four levels: visual, aural, intellectual, and emotional. The special effects hold up as some of the most disturbing that have ever been filmed. They aren't quite perfect, but given the subject matter you will have a tough time thinking of how they could have been done better in 1982 (or now, in today's impressive but hokey looking CGI). The sound of the Thing when it screams in pain is otherworldly and memorable. The movie gets you to think about how you would react in this situation, about the ramifications of such a creature existing, and about what actually happened since so many burning questions were left unanswered. It also hits the all-time height of paranoia, where your best friend could have been taken over by an alien with no regard for your or anyone else's life, and has the ability to kill you and take you over with a simple and easy touch. And the only way you will know whether the guy next to you is the thing is by harming it, and therefore, releasing it where it will destroy what it can in self defense. The only way to kill it is to burn it. You can't wound it because it can quickly repair itself by reforming itself. You can't freeze it. It survived 100,000 years of being frozen in the ice of Antarctica. You can't dismember it, since every cell is a being unto itself, capable of killing and imitating its victims.If you are into horror and sci-fi, this movie will impress you and keep you guessing, thinking, and hypothesizing. Whether you are squeamish or hard-stomached this one will stick in your memory. If you like happy endings, this will upset you. Regardless, it will leave you wondering what happened both during the movie and after its conclusion.",10,0,1,19 February 2006
Transformers," A good setup for the inevitable sequel
","Let me start out by saying that I taped every episode of the Transformers cartoon back when I was a kid. I owned every single Transformer that my parents would buy for me. When I heard there was going to be a movie adaptation with real life actors, I was taken aback a little. How could the Transformers effectively translate to CGI images and move amongst real life objects while retaining the personalities that made me love the cartoon? The answer is...okay at best. They spent more time setting up the story line than actually developing the characters of the Transformers. Once they did get around to showing their personalities, it was clear that the movie-makers were trying to stay true to the cartoon of two decades ago. They even got the guy who did Optimus Prime's voice from the cartoon to be his voice in the movie. Excellent touch. If you come into the movie with little or no Transformer knowledge, you might feel left out a bit, especially considering they don't develop the Decepticons much. The rivalry between Megatron and Starscream is old hat for me, but it will go over the head of the casual viewer. Plus, the personalities of Bumblebee, Jazz, and Ironhide are only hinted at.The problem here is that the Transformer storyline is too big to capture in a two-and-a-half hour film. Especially one that tries to start near the beginning and explain everything to uninitiated viewers. With the inevitable sequel, I expect a much more powerful plot to emerge since they won't have to spend 1.5 hours setting up the situation. Still, given the difficulty of what they were attempting here, they still come out looking pretty good. The special effects were ground-breaking and the attempts at humor were occasionally successful. You will leave the theater wanting more, since much of the emotional wallop was seemingly left for the sequel(s).",7,3,6,21 July 2007
