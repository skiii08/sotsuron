Casablanca," Another classic that all must see.
","This movie works an all levels.  The story, characters, dialogue, editing and scoring mesh together very well and, at the hands of a good director, they don't overpower each other, but rather work together to give us an enjoyable viewing experience.",Null,1,1,15 February 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A classic that everyone should see.
","I really like this movie.  I've seen it three times and each time I discover something new.  Its theme certainly resonates in any time period.  The whole cast, and particularly Jack Nicholson, deliver fine performances.  It's a classic and a must see.",7,0,2,15 February 2003
