Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I was glad to see that Lucus continued the Starwars saga.
","This movie was better than medocre. Most of it was pretty good, but not all of it.  My favorite part was watching the battle droids fight against the gungans.  Jar-Jar binks was funny and actually messed it up in the same way. Some parts weren't so great like the part in the ocean when they were getting chased by creatures that were eating each other up.  It ended pretty well but the crystal ball was quite a stupid idea, and I didn't care for it very much.  The movie had a couple of surprises and still kept you on your toes.  Finally it made the suspense of the second one keep coming because you know that anakin will evently become darth vader but by what time.",7,0,1,13 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," After the first two it fitted in so right.
",I certainly didn't love this one any less than the fourth one.  ofcourse good one but there was a twist to it and things that happened made sense in the story line.  When Yoda past away it was a sad moment at that time.  It ended well and the whole thing was fun.  I was disappointed to see this one get three stars instead of four stars.  All the starwars episodes from four to six deserved four stars.,10,0,0,13 January 2002
Alien," Sounds like its very scary.
",This movie sounds like it is very scary and it is.  The reason for a nine is because the special effects are great and for a nineteen seventy nine movie its hard to even accomplish that.  Some of the parts are grose.  But it makes you wonder who is going to make it out before it does.  By the end of the movie you knew there was going to be a sequel.  No complaints here.,9,0,1,13 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great movie go see it it had suspense
",I felt that Lord of the Rings was one of my top ten movies ever. It's very hard to beat starwars but this movie might have done it. Some people might agree to that anyway.  Lord of the rings had suspense and had a twist to it because a few things that happen you don't expect.  I believe this is a four star movie. This is one movie you can't miss,10,0,0,5 January 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," I didn't actually think they would come out with a sequel
",Terminator2 was better than its current processor. The first one was pretty good but this one was great. My pick for one of the best ten movies of all time.  The special effects were fanimanal.  If you would have saw it once than you can see it again.  One last thing is that it seems like an easy ten but swaznigger made it that easier.,10,1,1,11 January 2002
Aliens," Many movies are great follow ups and this sounds like another one just like it
",Like the orginal Aliens is a great movie. It was very grusome and scary just like the original. If there was a follow up that was just like the orginal it was this one.  Very few follow ups are just as good as the orginal.  If I was to recommend a movie this would certainly be on that list.,10,1,2,11 January 2002
Saving Private Ryan," A good tale to tell but a sad story told
",Very much so does this movie have high expectations.  yes it was expected to be decent.  At first I couldn't figure what was so important about saving private ryan.  I guess there was a purpose.  The narraration always stuck to the movie.  And the plot was right on target.  I thought the best part was the beginning when the men struggled to get on the shore.  You know my dad was in a war and he went through harsh times but I'm sure it was never that risky.  One thing I know this is a must see.,9,2,4,11 January 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," You didn't know there would be a sequel.
","this movie was grusome right from the beginning and didn't leave you behind in anyway.  The sad thing is,is that there are people who are like this in real life.  I can't say I am anyway like this and I never will be.  As one gets caught the other gets away and it seems like nothing was accomplished. Hannibal lecture lead the directions very well of get that mad man in which he was a mad man himself.  Makes perfect sense.",9,0,0,13 January 2002
The Sixth Sense," The movie brought alot of raves to the box office.
",At first it was kind of hard to understand what was going on in the movie. You do catch on to what is going on though evently after time.  The sixth sense had a twist too it and that makes any movie interesting.  The little boy sees dead people in his dreams and it happens very often.  One word of advise is you should go see this movie because it's better than what you expect.,9,0,0,13 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," By seeing the fourth one you know they had to have a continuation
",After seeing the first one you knew they would have a continuation.  So far they have kept up with the latest installments of the starwars episodes. Empire strikes Back is in my book the greatest continuation of any sequence. Of course other sequences got tens but this over excels in everything. The special effects in the movie seem like they could have been made in the 90's. One things for sure this series of movies gets more publicity than any other movie events.,10,0,0,11 January 2002
Gladiator," What a name for a movie. When I first saw the tv previews I knew it took place in Roman Times.
",Gladiator was a decite movie to go see and it had a twist to it at the end. The special features were incrediable.  For best picture of the year it ran very close to Erin Brokvich.  I like the part when the lion comes out of the trap off the ground and nearly bites him.  Whats interesting about the movie is that he gets past the biggest obstacles and finally everybody gets their freedom.  Nuff said,8,0,1,13 January 2002
