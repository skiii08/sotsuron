Ford v Ferrari," Good movie. Great dialouge
","One of the better movies I have watched out of the last 15hours of recent films I've endured through.
Great acting, natural dialogue that's super relatable.... all up an entertaining film, with racing scenes that any rev head would appreciate.",8,2,2,11 January 2020
