Antz," The film was great, but is it for kids?
","First of all, I loved Antz.  Dreamworks and PDI have amazed me in their animated debut, and the story was great fun.  The script read like a more lighthearted version of one of Woody Allen's films, and being a fan of both Allen and animation, the combination entertained me to such a degree, I went and saw it again.  My only problem with it is that it seems to ignore the fact that kids are flocking to see animated films.  The swearing that the characters do (mind you, it is limited) shocked me simply because I was not expecting it from an animated film geared towards the G-rated audience. Also, some of the battle scenes were violent to the point of possibly frightening younger viewers.  However, if the audience is 10 or older, Antz is one of the most sophisticatedly hilarious films I have seen, animated or not, in a long time.",10,0,0,8 October 1998
