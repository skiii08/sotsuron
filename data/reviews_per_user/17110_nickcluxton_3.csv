The Blair Witch Project," There are several ways to look at this one.
","This is the film that inspired the 'home video' movies like Paranormal Activity and such, but unlike them, this is an original film. It doesn't follow the normal criteria of a horror film of any kind. Some argue that it goes back to older horror movies around the time period of Dracula and Frankenstein because it's not graphic or big on visuals, but it builds suspense throughout the whole film. If you like a typical horror movie, avoid this one. The main premise is consistent throughout as well, but there's no sign of a moving story, so again, it's based on your preference. Most of all, people seem to have strong opinions on how scary this movie is. If suspense and anticipation is what's scary for you, then you will have a great time. If you're more into action, visuals, and stories, avoid it. Personally, it's not my cup of tea.",5,0,1,10 August 2012
Django Unchained," As I think about it more...
","Normally I would never do this prior to seeing a film, even a Tarantino film, but I got really hyped up and couldn't wait to see this. I really wanted to like it by any means necessary. And for a while, the film stood up to the hype. At least up until they finally get Django's wife and then Schultz shoots DiCaprio and stands like an idiot. From there the story, and the rest of the film altogether, lose meaning & value. I liked everything before that point, though. It was very stylistic, it was humorously violent and dark, and I actually payed attention to everything the characters were saying. Once they traded for Broomhilda, the movie should've ended. It should have only been a few minutes after that point to wrap up the film. I talked to a lot of people about Django after I saw it, and one of my friends made a sound observation that the last third of the film was more under the control of Jamie Foxx than Tarantino, and the quality dragged because of it. It was slower paced and had less clever dialogue. A lot of reviewers here have already made their observations about how unrealistic the ending was, so I'll leave it alone. I have a similar dilemma with 'Gladiator' in that I despise the first half-hour of it, much like I can't stand the last third of Django, so I never watch the whole thing. Still, I like when Tarantino actually lead production and I absolutely love DiCaprio's character. If you haven't seen it yet, I would definitely recommend it, but stop watching once Schultz & DiCaprio die.",6,0,2,3 May 2013
The Dark Knight," You don't have to like Batman to like this movie
","Personally, I never got into comics or anything related to it. I think Batman is silly. That aside, this movie is impressive. While the one flaw I see is Christian Bale, I still love everyone else. Heath Ledger has become everyove's favorite psycho-path. But a lot of it comes from the action and it is truly a treat for the eyes. And again, very few can get enough of the Joker. It's really worth watching, even if you hate Batman. The parts to look for are when the Joker is plotting anything. He is so insane and somehow casual at the same time. I dare not mention much more because I hate being the spoiler when it comes to good movies. If you haven't seen it already, GO!",7,0,1,11 November 2011
