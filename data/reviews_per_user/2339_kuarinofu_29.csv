The Rock," They don't make them quite like it any more
","The Rock combines the right amount of Michael Bay with above average action writing to deliver an action classic that feels great even in 2020.Yes, the script is not perfect and it has it's cheesy moments and cringy humor, but at the same times it's tense, the action is great, Zimmer's score is amazing and memorable, and Cage's overacting is priceless. I mean, how can you not love this guy acting crazy?I also loved that for an action movie The Rock has it's details. These are mostly delivered through acting, and it feels great to spot them.Quality entertainment and a must see at least once for every action fan (even in 2020).",8,1,2,1 January 2020
Hereditary," Has its moments, but doesn't really achieve anything
","I was unable to finish this movie in one sitting, mostly due to a very slow pace and quite a significant runtime it has. Yet I finished it, and this is what I can sum up:
1. The movie picks up and forgets subplots randomly. For example, this could've been a good psychological drama, but they just abandoned this element of the film by the end.
2. As it builds up it gets very confusing and convoluted, just because a logical human brain cannot process the kind of plot they are going for here. It just doesn't make much sense. A lot of suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy this one. It is quite departed from reality.
3. The ending just made the movie worse. The fact that their initial plot is so hard to swallow made them record a voice over to explain what actually happened. Not good.
4. Casting was good and most of the acting was as well. For some reason it feels like only Gabriel Byrne was somehow underperforming, I guess mostly because of the writing (he didn't have much to do either).
5. Horror elements in this were ups and downs, some of them worked well (like the elements borrowed from classic horrors of the 70's - creepy faces, walking corpses, the use of color in lighting - like Argento did in Suspiria and more). Some of the elements borrowed from modern horrors were misplaced and made it look like a comedy (I actually chuckled once).
Overall, this is a very long and slow mediocre horror with a couple of effective scares and tightly acted psychological drama elements that builds up good tension only to confuse you and kick you in the balls with an unsatisfactory ending. It's up for you to decide whether you want to watch something like this or not.
P.S. Some elements of the production were sloppy, for ex.: if you look closely you can see the strings pulling the pages of the notepad, some of the sound effects were not in sync (like the attic headbanging) and stuff. This kind of stuff is not healthy for the overall atmosphere.",7,0,1,15 September 2018
Us," Tonal mess
","Nice premise, great start, a good attempt at building a sinister atmosphere, yeah, up to around 40 minutes. Then the movie shifts towards slasher comedy, providing a couple of genuine good laughs here and there, but in the long run, it just kills its own atmosphere. It slowly starts making less sense up to a point when it becomes clear that there is no way this plot can hold up or have a somewhat satisfying resolution.
At around 1 hr mark the movie slows down and really starts to drag. At this point, you're just waiting to be disappointed and forget about it. The ending doesn't make any sense at all. The twist was so lame and predictable I was actually surprised they still went for it and it barely really changed anything.
I guess the ending was supposed to provide social commentary about how community and environment make you what you are, about people's shadows being their dark sides (there are even a couple of creative shots). Even so, this was done in a very simplistic manner and in the end didn't matter much. I mean, I can come up with some ideas on what they were trying to tell, but the movie feels more like the writers cornered themselves and just came up with whatever stuff that first got into their heads.
I enjoyed the first act though, nice music, fewer jump scares. The acting ranged from really good (Elisabeth Moss was amazing) and misdirected/confused (Evan Alex can't act scared at all).
I think I'd still recommend this movie since it had some good scenes sprinkled throughout the movie, some good acting, two or three misplaced but actually funny jokes, even some tension. Well, at least I can surely recommend the first 40-50 minutes, after that you can just stick around and witness the nonsensical ending yourself :)",6,1,2,1 July 2019
Aquaman," Meh
","Didn't expect much and wasn't really disappointed.
The story was 100% predictable. Everything was obvious from the start and there was really nothing the movie could've impressed me with.
Around 70% of the dialogue was expository, 20% was people saying really stupid things and 10% of really awkward humor. I did laugh at some of the lines though, but those were unintentionally funny. They did sometimes make fun of some things showing that they are aware of some of the stupidities they have there only to stay true to the source material. They did, however, spend a lot of effort to make sure you understand everything that is going on. Everything that happens or even gets mentioned is explained in a flashback scene or by characters in full. Even before the giant sea beast attacks it makes sure to give you some exposition at first.
Most of the visuals were ok but not very creative or interesting. They did have some good ones though, like 2 or 3. From the top of my head, the starting lighthouse fight scene was cool, the trench dive and the wine magic scenes were also pleasant to the eye.
Most of the acting was good (would've been strange if it was otherwise with such cast). Except for our two leads, Mera and Arthur. I didn't like both Aquaman as a character and Momoa's performance. First they set him up as a guy with super powers and an enormous ego. I though this was made intentionally to show his path and his growth as a character in the end. But this wasn't the case, he just was lucky to get a better weapon and randomly rescue his mom in the process (side quests, right?). He's still the same egocentric guy with super powers. And this is pretty much what he was, the movie even emphasizes on that since the ending is extremely dull, they even go for the basic 'become the king and get the girl' thing. Super one-dimensional. I'm not familiar with the source material so maybe this was just them staying loyal (just as having a laughable costume for the Black Manta).
Mera's motivation as a character was unclear yet she seems to care so much (not sure about what particularly) throughout the movie. She was ruined mostly by Amber Heard's performance. She was horrible, she didn't care for a second about her acting and it was obvious. They did gave her nothing to work with though, she's just a plot device, a girl the main guy gets in the end. At least I did enjoy her costume :)
There was also some sort of an environmental message but it was so bleak I almost forgot about this when I finished the movie.
The main problem of this movie is that it's around 7 years late. This would've worked so much better if made around 2012. The hero is not impressive, the story is not particularly interesting, the lore is stupid and unintentionally funny.
They did know what they were doing and there clues in the movie to substantiate that. I don't think that there was a better way to make an Aquaman movie, but this is still instantly forgettable.",7,0,2,27 January 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Visually beautiful 2 hrs of actors having fun on set
","First of all, props to all the visual effects teams involved, IL&M and others, the movie really did look amazing (even though 3D felt off sometimes).This movie is very similar to another MCU movie 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' in many ways:1. This movie also had almost no plot, and even those parts were standing still for about 80% of the movie. By the end of the movie the plot is rushed through a couple of scenes and 'bam!', it's over.2. It also has the same structure: most of the movie consists of action scenes and funny exchanges between the characters. Sometimes the movie goes deeper and opens some of the backstories but it always feels forced. I remember even a couple of lines like 'so, what's your story' and the guy starts to backtrack.3. Like in GotG2 I found it really hard to care about any of the characters and the 'story' just because nobody in this film cares about what's going on. Nobody has motivation to do anything. They just sort of do things because they sort of should and thus everything is funny and just a daily routine for them. Thor's father is dead and his home is invaded but he still has some time to spend pushing funny lines with his friends. Banner spent 2 years being Hulk and still behaves kind of confused and corky, trying to be funny as everyone else. Loki's presence was completely optional but they obviously couldn't just remove him from the story.4. Most of the characters are interchangeable. They occasionally get some sort of personality traits but most of the time they all act and react the same.My biggest problem with MCU movies is that as there's more and more movies being released they tend to lose any sort of originality and freshness (which is typical for anything not just movies). It would've been much easier for me to remember each movie if I had something to grab to, like a strong character or a really intense emotion, but these movies just fail to deliver those lately.It is interesting that DCU movies are often blamed for being too serious and dark to be actually fun, but MCU ones are drifting further and further away from being called actual movies becoming pretty much what they should be, I guess - a motion picture representation of a comic book.I'm not a comic book fan but I still hope that comic books are not all about flashy imagery and easy laughs. Or am I wrong?8 for the looks and some well done action.",8,1,6,4 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Emotionally draining (longread, no spoilers)
","I'm not going to advise you whether you should or should not watch it, or which reviews you should or should not trust.Star Wars: TRS is a good-looking film with no emotional ground under it.They try to immerse the viewer in a vivid world with a huge number of planets, races, references and nostalgia. Despite the fact that they managed to do it, SW has never been about that. It was never about vistas and action (at least the original trilogy), bur rather about concepts and emotions.The movie feels very much detached from the previous parts, and it gives the impression that with the previous two installments they failed to establish new and interesting characters and storylines besides the Kylo - Rei thing.The idea of a long-term conflict in itself is exhausting, and the re-emergence of even more classic characters creates a sense of incompleteness in the original films (the original trilogy). They should've just went their own way (as suggested by Ren himself).The very idea and the plot of the film perfectly reflects the attitude of the franchise owners to the film itself and the story behind it. They are never going to stop it. Everything that happens has no real basis and no event leads to the real end of the story.The story wasn't terrible, but it definitely contained a lot of stupid moments. Perhaps if the creators had originally had a plan and a story for all of the three films, we would have had a complete in-depth story on the way out.As it stands now, it looks as if in the second installment, when they tried to move away from the usual plot schemes, they wrote themselves into a corner, and now they had to go back to the old and proven themes again. This mostly felt like damage control, a script that was reviewed by a committee in order to minimize the damage that has already been done (it really looks like they watched the reviews for the last two films and formed a list of key points they have to cover).The concept of the force, even though it has never been clearly defined enough (except from the prequels stupidity), feels very different in this film. What they are trying to say is that everyone is a force user and everyone can do almost anything. They also actively use the force as an excuse for bad writing, which was, however, done before.Many scenes in this just feel like 'why not' ones. I got a better idea of the reason why it was done, judging by the reactions of the audience around me in the cinema.The ending feels very anticlimactic and cliche. Some aspects of the film that cannot be discussed without spoilers break the motivation of the villains. The creators tried to surprise the viewer by developing more and more ridiculous things and ideas. A lot of screen time is devoted to chasing various mcguffins and it hurts it pretty badly. It would have been much better if the film had been deeper and more symbolic, but it turned out to be quite superficial and meaningless.What was most depressing to me, however, was that the emotional finale between Kylo and Rey, their emotional connection, which was almost the only interesting storyline in the new trilogy, although it felt obvious, was shot so poorly that it almost felt like a comedy sequence.In the end, we came to the same point where we started. Many people have suffered in a conflict that seems to be beyond stopping.Emotions, feelings, sensations, all of these things are no longer significant. By the end of the film I felt emotionally drained to the point when even the music was unable to spark an emotion inside me. I felt like I was a part of something that never should've been created.",6,1,5,22 December 2019
Bird Box," This was a movie alright
","I mean, there is nothing special about this at all.Such premise has been done before, watch The Happening or Pontypool. At first it borrows from The Happening, then from the Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, then The Road (or Cargo, whatever), then A Quite Place. I predicted almost every major scene and the ending of most of the plot lines they had. It was super predictable and never really interesting. I did not expect any answers and I'm ok with the movie not explaining anything, but this just wasn't particularly interesting for me.It's a movie you can expect from Netflix, good production, marketing and promo baiting you into checking it out, but the movie itself turns out to be pretty generic and not particularly interesting.P.S. In my opinion, Sandra Bullock wasn't the best choice for the role either. Imagine this with Essie Davis from The Babadook, damn this would've been much more intense.",6,0,1,13 January 2019
28 Weeks Later," Nice visually and thematically, not as good with acting or storytelling
","28 Weeks Later is a good follow-up to the first installment. It keeps the overall theme while still adding something new.While it doesn't look like it was shot on a digital camera (like the 28 days intentionally was), it still manages to look realistic and gritty. The overabundance of shaky-cam though is quite annoying though the more you watch.It has some interesting visuals, some very basic symbolism (I'd even call it 'film school' symbolism) for most audiences to understand. The music is nice and they have succeded with building up the 'dead city' atmosphere (hence the intercut shots of the city and the graveyard while they are driving through).And while there lots of really good and stylish visuals that many will enjoy, story-wise it doesn't make a lot of sense. The scenes I'm talking about are cool to watch but when you stop and think about one - it crumbles. Also, the acting wasn't that good, Elba had nothing to do in this film, Renner was boring. Carlyle was the only exception cause of how feral he looks while infected. I'm sure that good performances would've made this much better, but it seems like the script wouldn't allow it.Anyway, 28 Weeks Later is a good film (especially if you loved the first one). Give it a deeper look and you might find more than just a zombie film, the director has put lots of stuff in there for you to enjoy.",7,0,0,21 June 2020
Armageddon," My fix of stupid epic action, trailer dialogue, slow-mo and US flags
","This film is a much easier experience if you make one thing clear for yourself - Armageddon is too stupid to be a science fiction film. It's a big-budget dumb 90ties action with a relatable action hero and an emotional side character that will tell the audience how they should feel in a particular situation with her facial expressions. It's pretty much Bay's 'The Rock' scene by scene but in space.It's pure brainless entertainment. At least it was when it was released.Now, in 2020, a new dimension of entertainment opened itself to the thinking viewers - you can observe and study the genesis of the staples and cliches of now big names like Michael Bay and J. J. Abrams.Michael Bay with his tons of epic-slow mo, explosions, women objectification and USA fetish.And J. J. Abrams with his constant tension build-ups, trailer dialogue, emotional but nonsensical scenes, 'what, it doesn't make sense? who cares! excitement! excitement!'I'm not going to dig too deep into this just because there is nothing to look for.If you've never seen this film, watch it once with your brain completely shut off. You might enjoy it. As for us, the 80ties and 90ties kids, we can revisit this film from time to time to remind ourselves of the time that was less horrible than 2020ies.",6,1,2,23 February 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The beginning of the end
","Re-watching this film in 2020 after all the sequels and re-quels makes so much more sense since it gives you a clear picture of when and where it all started. I'm talking about the parasitism of the Terminator franchise.Obviously, every film after the first one is the same exact film, yet if Terminator 2 was a superior big-budget refined version of the first one, every other film after it was just a lesser version of T2 (except for Salvation, which was a slightly different take but still bad).Interestingly enough, when I watched Genisys in the theatre I thought that this idea of re-shooting the classic ones frame-by-frame is just a sign of creative bankruptcy that the franchise has come to.Then Dark Fate came out, and it was exactly the same film as T2 scene-by-scene with different backdrops and CGI. There was little to no original content in that. I have a detailed review of the Dark Fate as well.And now, after re-watching Rise of the Machines, the picture is finally clear in my mind. The franchise was never supposed to live past T2, the story was over, and this film shows it.Rise of the Machines is a cheesy badly written rehash of T2 with horrible CGI that was never good and doesn't hold up in 2020.There are some redeeming factors like the insane car chase with actual physical stunts which looks great even in 2020, and the ending was surprisingly good for a horribly written story like this.And of course, Arnie was great to look at, even though his character is a comically large dumb robot, which is what our beloved Terminator has become after this film in all the sequels that feature real Arnie, both Genisys, and Dark Fate made him a joke as well.There should have never been a T2 sequel. We stopped Judgement Day but found ourselves in a Garbage Day.",5,2,5,18 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," I appreciate it for what it was but it just didn't work for me
","This was a very well made movie. They pulled off a good job trying to mash all the characters into the film, and the movie just had to have a huge epic battle in the end. Otherwise, most audiences would instantly hate the movie. They tried to give all the characters something to do like they did in Infinity War, and it worked (yet they had to get rid of Captain Marvel for most of the movie to have this structure somewhat functional, like DC did with Superman in Justice League).
They've established that their time travel is different from other movies, but it still felt inconsistent and confusing. Long story short this just allowed them to shape the story as they needed it without the need to follow basic time travel rules.
Infinity War worked because it was a basic comic book movie with a twist ending nobody expected and an untypical villain. This one was reverted to basics. I knew they were doing time travel, but I thought that they would play this around Thanos and his re-thinking of his decisions from other time parallels. This never happened, even more, his character in the past is much more cliche and uninteresting (also much more stronger than without the gauntlet).
All the drama didn't work for me either. They always put a joke here and there to lighten up the tension and just because most of the characters are basic superheroes who spill one-liners here and there. Thus, all the dramatic moments were sacrificed to stay in-line with the characters.
The epic battle was confusing and felt like the mess they did in Ready Player One, just tons of hours of CGI artists' work. It's just me, but I get bored fast of these things. This is why all the fan service of putting all the characters into the movie didn't work for me. Infinity War had them all grouped and positioned for better understanding, here it's just a mess. But they really couldn't do this otherwise anyway.
I genuinely enjoyed only three moments in this movie, Tony Stark talking to his father in 1970, Thanos seeing the memories from the parallel timeline of his success and his death (which they wasted anyway later making him even more stupid than a basic comic book villain, hence his dialogue), and Cpt. America acting up 'Heil, Hydra' in the elevator. These were amazing.
Other than that, even fat Thor and the Hulk hating stairs didn't even break a smile on my face (as most of the out of place humor). The theater actually laughed more when Red Skull said 'Welcome, Natasha, daughter of Ivan.' I live in Ukraine and these names are very basic for us, so it just sounded like he'd say 'Welcome, Jenny, daughter of Billy'.
Anyway. I did not feel the satisfaction or the emotion I thought I would. Stark's sacrifice was justified, yet again, the drama in this movie didn't work for me. I didn't feel changed emotionally and for me this means that this movie was unable to touch me in the rights places.",7,4,6,7 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Good action and visuals
","This is a well made Marvel superhero comic book movie. 
You may stumble upon many reviews saying that this movie is Marvel's magnum opus, a comic book movie masterpiece that asks questions, brings up new and interesting ideas and stuff, but it's not. 
It is written much better than most of Marvel's stuff, yet this type of movie has its limits, mostly because it is made to appeal to the widest possible audience. This means that some of the core elements have to be dumbed-down to be more understandable and simple. Thus all the drama parts are very simplistic in order to be easier to process by younger audiences. I hoped that this movie would have been a little heavier but it's not.
This fact also affects the dialogue, most of which is either a failed attempt at humor (yet the 'target' audience, younger kids, seemed to be enjoying every joke in the theater), or an attempt to overexplain the simplistic plot, or some really weird pop culture reference younger audiences won't be able to understand anyway. Thus, most of the talking parts were a pain to sit through with rare exceptions. There was one good joke set up by War Machine in Wakanda though.
The action was great, even though at times it was hard to understand what was going on. From time to time the superheroes even use their abilities in a clever way. CGI was mostly good too and some of the environments they created were pleasing to the eye, especially the Vormir part, neat art direction. Kudos to all 3000 of CGI artists and studios that made this movie. One of the weakest technical parts was the soundtrack, the tracks were forgettable and not fitting at times. 
Plotwise the movie was extremely predictable, furthermore, the events of the second part are also easy to predict. I don't want to spoil anything, but a change of heart is what we are going to see.
A well made movie that, while being probably the most emotion-packed of Marvel movies, is still unable to provide you with that feel or emotion when you leave the theater changed at heart.",8,1,3,19 May 2018
2012," Surprisingly boring and stupid
","I never thought I'd say this for a big-budget disaster film, but here I am:2012 is a long, boring and stupid movie. The creators have probably mistaken 'stupidity' for 'melodrama' since most of the supposedly melodramatic scenes are just stupid people doing stupid things and screaming.They dumped so much money on effects and there's still no feeling of real danger or immersion just because how stupid and comical it is. The characters are pure stereotypes, the science of the film is beyond me, even the decisions taken by humanity's best are childish (build arcs?, you know we have BIG ships, right?).I mean, could they at least try to write an adequate script instead of doing the same thing again?It's like Roland Emmerich really needs to see The Host (2006) to finally understand how to wrap a family drama in a disaster film.And the funny thing is that they are doing it again. They already have 150 mil budget for Moonfall movie. Here we go again.",5,1,2,9 January 2020
1917," Immersive experience through technical achievement
","While 1917 is a great experience motsly due to the way it's shot and edited, the abscence of a good story really hurts it.1917 does feel like a collection of war stories told by the people involved (which it surely is) but there is no rooting message in this story, no real characterizations or relatable human emotions. Some of the stories feel disconnected from each other and feel like filler.If you disregard the single shot style of the editing, the film would feel no different than Midway, for example. Midway was a big budget spectacle with no story and little dramatic elements and this one is too. I understand the attempt to move from heroism cliches but having no emotional investment in a war film is not a good idea.Aside from a couple of Mendes' trademarks like the truck scene (reminiscent of the Semper Fi scene of Jarhead) and night fire silhouettes (reminiscent of Skyfall), there is not much to grasp to.It also has a big segment that is so tonally different and disconnected from the film it makes you wonder why did they put it in (the sniper scene and the follow-up with the baby).1917 is a technical achievement with little to no essence. While this style of immersion is inspiring, more investment into the story would've made it even better.",8,1,1,15 February 2020
Event Horizon," This needs an R-rated re-make
","I've seen this around 4 or 5 times now, first at release and the last time pretty much just finished it.
This movie actually makes me sad since it's underdeveloped in almost every aspect.
It is weak as a sci-fi movie, it sucks as a horror since it uses only the most obvious jump scares. The pacing and the editing is clunky. When I watched it the last time I caught myself thinking on how each individual scene could've been easily improved. This movie was clearly inspired by Alien, Aliens, Hellraiser and DooM game series (there are even some Doom easter eggs in the movie). Also, it's hard to watch this in 2019 since the effects really don't hold up, some of them look so bad I don't think they were good even by 1997 standards.
This is frustrating since the movie has some really good gore (and it obviously had more, but it was severely cut by the studio), and a very distinct style in set (and ship) design. Some of the sets they have are amazing, and even though it makes absolutely no sense in terms of actual engineering it still looks amazing. Very nice craft. The actors did their best with a script like that. I mean, some of the ending scenes are so comical and unintentionally funny you really can't handle those any better.
No real point in watching or re-watching this in 2019, but there is a need to re-make this ASAP. I can see this as a kind of slower psychological horror about space isolation with a tint of supernatural. Get a competent director and this would fly for sure.",7,1,1,3 February 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 90% safe and marketable mediocrity, 10% interesting ideas
","I'm not going to tell you whether it was good or bad, this is for you to decide. I will just try to share my experience. Spoiler-free, of course, yet there is not that much to spoil in this episode. The movie was mostly predictable for a sane person.
Right of the bat, the first scene of the movie sets up the tone - this is a comedy. Nothing has to be taken seriously. Every strong or dramatic moment will most likely be ruined by a corky comedy scene to lighten up the tone. The studio does not want you to get upset, you know.
This also features a lot of improvisation. If you have seen Thor Ragnarok, this comes very close to that movie. I think the director believed that this will make the characters more grounded and real, yet it's just annoying most of the time. You're trying to get invested into a scene, and the movie takes you from your seat and shakes you up: 'remember, no getting invested'. Maybe it just doesn't work for me personally, IDK.
As the main plot developed I found myself mostly confused, lots of 'what?' moments occur, things I could not explain to myself even though I'm not new to SW. It also features a couple of additional subplots only one of which I found interesting, not going to spoil it though. New characters were introduced, mostly to make the movie more marketable and to bring more 'diversity'. You can see corporate decisions behind this - no chances at sexism, racial discrimination or anything trending right now, maximum safety. This is a second installment with the new characters and yet I still can find myself rooting only for the classic ones, and there are not that much of those left. Due to some unfortunate real life events, I'm afraid the next episode will lose those as well, maybe I'm wrong though. It is also interesting how Chewie just doesn't work as a standalone character in the absence of Solo.
The acting made me question my understanding of the franchise. Hux, while being Hitler-like character in the 7th movie, now completely turned into a cartoon character or a parody by Charlie Chaplin. Rey's emotions and facial expressions are still indistinguishable, as well as Kylo's TBH. Poe and Finn come closest to having a real character arc and yet the movie still finds a way to throw that to the ground.
And this is where my main grudge with this movie lies. There were some really interesting and creative setups throughout the movie when the it baits you into thinking that the movie is going to get serious and do something unexpectedly good with the characters and the story. And then it just falls flat on its butt. Spoilers keep me from giving you examples of what I mean, but I'm sure you'll see those as well when you see the movie.
Overall, I wasn't too disappointed, I was mostly sad. If this is the Star Wars for the new generation, I'm happy to stay with the old one. Visuals were pleasing, space battles were well made, but this is not exactly what I'm looking for in SW.
P.S. Merch placement got really out of hand in this movie, I get it that these new creatures were made for the purpose of making money, but man they like to shove these into viewer's face.",7,26,67,14 December 2017
Midsommar," Loved it for what it was
","Yes, it's overly long, it's slow and boring at times, there are lots of pointless scenes (they intercut the story progression scenes with random weird stuff to slow it down a little) and all the additional plotlines go absolutely nowhere, but in the end, I still appreciate the time I spent on this film.This is so much easier to watch if you just take all the weird stuff lightly because it's obviously there just to be weird and bizarre. The same should be done for the pretentious and artsy style of some scenes. I mostly laughed at all the bizarre stuff just because it was so hilarious and I couldn't help myself.The ending, however, made me laugh out loud but not due to cheesy bizarrity that was going on, but due to complete and utter joy. I was so satisfied with the ending and all the character stuff in this, it just felt complete in the end.It was also well-made on the technical side, I enjoyed long complicated scenes they've managed. And special appreciation goes to Florence Pugh for delivering a great performance of an abusive attention-hungry psychotic girlfriend with a dark past.Obviously, Midsommar is not for everyone, but if you want to watch it for a reason, and you know what you're up to, you won't be disappointed.",9,3,5,23 February 2020
The Shape of Water," Social justice stereotypes wrapped into great visuals
","Guillermo del Toro was always a master of adaptation of fairy tales to the big screen. In my opinion, his stronger side was always the visuals. Pan's Labyrinth - beautiful, Crimson Peak - gorgeous, Cronos - eerie yet still stylish. You can go on and on. Even when he was in just for the money, like in Pacific Rim, he was still competent at what he was doing. Everybody needs money to pursue their dreams.
I decided to check The Shape of Water mostly because of Oscars. I didn't expect much since Oscars is not really what it used to be anymore.
Everything regarding style and production was masterfully done. Great costume design, color correction, the feel of the 60s, nice creature effects, every scene had rich backgrounds, very living film overall. I was surprised with the work they've done with this budget, very professional. 
However, the story wasn't on par with everything else. If you just watch it and don't dig deep it's fine, but if you look just a little into it - it loses all the charm. It felt less a fairy tale story and more like a complex of the most trendy political ideas. The formula is very simple - white male (sexist, racist, violent, power hungry member of the consumer society) oppresses everyone else. The main antagonist is just a hyperbolic mix of all the negative qualities and ideas. Everyone else is being oppressed, the mute, because she's a mute and a woman, the fishman, because he's different, the African-american woman, because of her race and because she's a woman, the old poster artist, because he's gay etc. The guy even treats his wife like a piece of meat, and he is of course a rapist. And the icing on the cake was feminism. The scene with the African-american janitor lady's husband. The portrayal of him as an absolutely worthless human being, who won't even stand from his TV chair to protect his wife, amazing. I also loved the high ranking military official portrayed as a dumb self-confident murderer.
A lot of effort is put in to make sure that you would feel guilty for just being straight white male. This was the message of the movie and it would've been a lesser evil if they would just approach it a little less biased. Just show real people instead of robots filled with stereotypes. Instead we get a perfect main heroine and her sidekicks against the evil of white male domination.",5,2,5,14 March 2018
Joker," I wish this wasn'ta Joker movie
","Joker (2019) is good. It's very good. You have to be completely out of your mind if you can't appreciate what the did.It looks great, the lighting, the color correction, the setting, the aspect ratio also helps a lot. It is captivating in IMAX.It sounds great, good original soundtrack cleverly used.It is well-acted. Phoenix's performance is out of the question. Great casting choice. Now we have two great Jokers. I don't want to choose or try to decide who is better, they are both amazing.It's slow, but not too slow. 2hrs felt like 30 minutes. And even though the ending has 2 unnecessary scenes, it felt complete.In my humble opinion, this movie could've been better only if it wasn't related to the Batman/Joker scenario. These scenes were the weakest parts for me, they felt like they were only there to please the comic book fans. If this was a completely independent movie this would kind of resemble the Taxi Drier, but not a whole lot.Great movie though I wish they would drop the comic book stuff.",9,0,1,5 October 2019
Con Air," Oh the nineties
","Con Air really coins the term 'stupid action blockbuster'.It is held together by great cast (performances) and insane action. It is stupid, but it's still somewhat entertaining and childishly romantic.While it's clearly not going to top any 90ties action lists, it is still watchable (or re-watchable if you saw it as a kid or young adult in the 90ties).Obviously the plot is full of holes, but it's sufficient for an action film (especially a 90ties one). The only distracting or rather confusing thing was the teleportation and insane continuity errors. It's like Schrödinger's cat, when our characters are not on screen they disappear from their relative position and re-appear when we start looking. Nobody is anywhere consistently and this provides for some funny situations.It was also very weird for me to see Cage as a ripped action hero and for me he looks kinda comical in these roles (like in Face/Off, same year). If you want to be entertained, to immerse yourself in the 90ties and have a good laugh - you're welcome to watch Con Air. Not the best one of the 90ties by far, but a tolerable action ride.",5,1,1,13 January 2020
Parasite," Morally grey
","Despite the fact that at first glance the film seems quite simple, drawing the viewer's interest and slowly moving to mostly comedic elements, after the first hour the situation changes fundamentally.We get to know better both of the families and it becomes clear that there are no characters to root for, no 'good guys' of the story. The film focuses on 'crossing the line' which has multiple meanings and is manifested in different ways during the viewing.I don't want to spoil anything, so I definitely recommend watching this closely and then re-visiting this film after some time since it has a lot of brain fuel to keep you busy thinking about it.",9,1,5,5 January 2020
Wonder Woman," A romantic comedy for girls with a WW1 theme as understood by 10 y.o.
","First of all, this movie is going to be marketed as a 'symbol of gender equality' (trying to do the same trick the new Ghostbusters did) and I'm sure it will succeed. Those guys from marketing really know their tricks nowadays, it is easy to cash in by creating an artificial conflict. This is interesting since this movie disrespects women. Same it does for men. Up to the first 90 minutes the movie follows the same scheme: a man sees WW, tells her she's hot, she reacts to everything like a baby, most of her dialogue is incomprehensible screaming, then she exchanges a couple of corky lines with Steve on how inexperienced she is in terms of men and women relationships. And there's also some sort of a plot.Every character in this is a comic relief (exept for WW and Steve), I can't tell if those characters come directly from the comic books, but they felt completely unfunny and unnecessary. It really felt more like an attempt to represent all racial groups, but the movie mocks them as well, making them look like complete retards. The gas lady and Ludendorff were ripped straight out of a children's cartoon. Sir Patricks was obvious at being a main villain yet his looks really did fool me by just how bizarre he was.Not WW's plan, nor the villain's plan is comprehensible. Steve has stolen the book from the gas lady, which as it turns she and he didn't need at all. Her and Ludendorff wanted to create a gas that pretty much does the same thing that any gas of that era but burns gas masks as a bonus. They wanted to do this for reasons unknown, since the war was over and nothing could've changed that. For some reason she thought that her death gas was a bigger weapon THAN A GAS THAT MAKES YOU SUPERHUMAN. WW's motivation was unclear as well, at first she wanted to kill Ludendorf since she assumed that he is Ares. Then she completely dumped that idea and went shopping and being socially awkward. By the end of the movie, when Ludendorf and gas lady are trying to board a bomber full of EXPLODING gas ASSUMING it will for some reason reach London DURING A WAR while WW is fighting her brother (big shocker) while he is saying really stupid things you can ever hear from a Greek god. After a Batman v Superman fight scene and OBLIGATORY Jesus symbolism with Twelve Apostles (being randomly friendly soldiers from different factions) we get the message that she ended all wars with love, or by a bolt of lightning into her brother, whatever. It was funny to see that symbolism since Gal Gadot is obviously Jewish.At first I hated this movie, then I was wishing for it to end quicker, by the end it sort of redeemed some of the flaws but it was so ungodly stupid and disrespectful that I would never recommend it to anyone.The worst: the plot, the characters, a ton of romantic talk scenes + trying on clothes scenes, the villain, the humour.The best: Gal Gadot is beautiful and she's in great shape, ~ 10 mins of great action (without lightning bolts and fire), beautiful and memorable soundtrack (yet it was cut down very fast for some reason).",5,14,33,1 June 2017
Black Panther," Wishful thinking / Broken ratings / Longread
","First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie.",6,347,689,19 February 2018
Mother!," Good movie most of the time
","This is a true artist's look at life and its cycle, the beginning and the end. Life of Earth (mother Earth), God and man, represented by the mob. It has a lot of references and allegory, not sure I got all of it and I'm pretty sure I did misunderstand some of it or interpreted it my way.It felt very random for about 2/3 of the runtime but in the end it all made perfect sense. You don't have to be super smart to understand multiple messages the it is trying to give. After completing it backtracking to some scenes make much more sense and it all starts to catch up to you.It is very heavy on religious motives and stories as well (kind of what you expect from Aronofsky). I'm not a religious person yet it wasn't so hard for me to understand those, since those are just compiled symbolic stories about the nature of man.Overall, this is a well crafted feature. I can't really call this a movie since it kind of isn't. If you expect it to have movie structure, character arcs and any sort of resolution you won't find it here. I was surprised to see how many people confused this for a horror flick or something and thus gave this 1/10. If your mind is open and you want to give yourself some material to think about, give this a try.",8,0,2,10 January 2018
Lucy," Complete nonsense
","Lucy (2014) is something in-between of a bad sci-fi film written by someone who doesn't know how the genre works and a basic action film with a very pretentious script.Lucy is too nonsensical and not nearly grounded enough to be an enjoyable sci-fi film since it not only has no rules whatsoever but also breaks its own rules that are not even there (imagine that). I mean, she can manipulate matter, intercept radiowaves, see in x-ray vision, but she still needs to fly by plane, to drive cars, she needs the help of other people to make her a drip only to have at least 2-3 characters in the film.
She says she feels everything and remembers everything, yet she calls her mom to tell her that she loves her, even though she acts completely emotionless all the time. She says she doesn't feel fear and a couple of scenes later she seems frightened when she starts to disintegrate like in The Avengers on the plane. Inconsistencies like these just show how unaccustomed the writers were with the genre.The film also has a drug lord villain who is so unnecessary and incredibly not threatening to her it just makes no sense (also, great job on wasting Min-sik Choi in this). They make parallels to wild nature indicating that she was prey for a predator and then she sort of becomes the predator, but not really and they never come back to this...whatever.I'm not even going to start on the brain capacity usage, ok, a theory is a theory, whatever, but you've got to have rules in your sci-fi story or it will completely derail into absurdity.P.S. Yes, Luc Besson, we know you love female heroines and stacking up police cars.",5,0,3,26 March 2020
Midway," Wow, a comic book action about war
","Roland Emmerich, ladies and gentlemen.I knew what to expect from him but still am quite impressed. I mean, he only does relatively big budget huge in scale nonsense films with little to no story split between 20-25 characters (and re-using them, I felt sad this film had no smug and sleazy supposedly Jewish lawyer stereotype).And this film is no different except for one important thing - real people are being portrayed.The film has two major issues. The first one is expected - the story is a mess and the pacing is all over the place. The film jumps around places and characters, half of which get nearly not enough screen time to make them memorable. All the dialogue is either cliche heroism motivation speeches or 100% unrefined exposition, when a character says literally the key note you have to be getting out of that scene, since it's so bad its incomprehensible without an explanation. It just follows the pattern - action scene->nonsensical dialogue->exposition. After a couple of iterations the film ends and we are told some backstory about the real people that were shown in the film, and it just makes you wonder how good would it be if they had actual real characters with emotions and motivations besides 'that one guy we didn't know anything about who died in the first 5 minutes made him really angry'. They could've written this in a way to provide great service to the real people portrayed in this, who did their best and acted selflessly, but they didn't bother. So all of our 'characters' are mostly cardboard cut-outs who are more shallow than modern comic book superheroes. It was nice to see real pictures in the end, but please, have some respect. I would never care if an overblown action film had badly written characters but these are real people.The second issue is the look of the film. The lighting and the color correction is probably intentional and is done to reference some sort of style (and the poster too). So it feels like they wanted it to look this way. But the horrible green screens and composite shots really hurt this film. Roland Emmerich actually made me feel like I'm watching a Star Wars prequel, you know, with full CGI backdrops that never look realistic or believable. Some of the CGI shots also felt like a modern video-game cutscene. It looked too bright, too polished and new for a war film. I mean yeah, Dunkirk also looked stylized, but Nolan was actually able to present three different timeFLOWS, not even timelines. So don't get me started on this one (and the budgets are comparable). I haven't seen this in a theater but my home setup is sufficient to enjoy a good picture with surround sound, and I mostly laughed at the dialogue or felt bored during CGI battles.
P.S. I also want to commend most of the actors for giving a good performance even given the bad script, except for Ed Skrein, he was clearly cast only for the looks and he felt confused on what he is trying to deliver throughout the film.
P.P.S. Also, the way the Japanese are portrayed at first comes as a bit of a surprise, but when you check the production companies and the markets this film was aimed for (mostly Chinese audiences) it all makes sense. I mean, I'm not going to talk about propaganda and conspiracy theories, but a thinking person will understand what I mean with a single viewing.",6,2,4,6 February 2020
Green Book," Tries to pull off a safe approach to a complicated issue (spoiler-free)
","This was a good film and on an EMOTIONAL LEVEL I did enjoy it. The performances were amazing yet I loved Mortensen's one better (hard to believe he's Danish).The big problem about it though is that it tries to be too safe and kid-friendly. At times it really feels like it was written as a cristmas miracle story for kids to enjoy.It kind of wants be a serious story about the morale and the people of the time, but everyone besides the main duo are too cartoonish to be beliveable. It kind of brings up the issues of racial segregation but it's afraid to show real racist white people and the negatives from the other side. It shows hard working African Americans on the field to give contrast to the Doc (and to show later that he doesn't feel like he belongs to anyone, even his own people) but it falls into some sort of social justice commentary, when the whole point of capitalism was to give equal opportunities, so if the Doc was educated, worked hard and was paid well it doesn't mean he has to feel guilty before those hardworking farmers. The YMCA reveal scene was kind of made to show why Frank is called 'Tonly Lip' but the set up was so unnecessary forced I can't really tell why they went for it in the first place. The ending was cartoonish and family friendly, which is ok, but it really goes on big stretches with some stuff, like the Doc wishing a Merry Christmas to his butler Amit, who's clearly far from being a christian, I mean... You see? It's clearly trying to hard not to offend anyone.I loved that movie, mostly for the duo, the dialogue and overall chemistry between them, great stuff. But the social commentary, the simplification, the idea behind making this a 'based on a true story' movie... If they were real people - show us what they were, if not - make this a separate story 'inspired' by real events.I just wish it was so much more grounded, I'd enjoy it much more.",7,1,1,6 April 2019
Annihilation," Rather good but overloaded with unnecessary stuff
","This was an ok movie. There's lots of very negative reviews giving this 1-2 stars, don't believe those, it's not horrible. It just has some issues that heavily decrease the amount of enjoyment you can get from this.
I'll focus only on bad parts. But it has good stuff as well.
1. It's overloaded with unnecessary scenes that add nothing. 50% of Portman scenes feel tonally different from everything else. These are mostly flashbacks about a hard woman's life with a husband missing. These just don't fit the context of the movie overall.
2. The movie tries to be Science Fiction but in fact it's totally divorced from reality and any particular science. They didn't want to overcomplicate things, but even past that, it is full of outright dumb stuff (scientists carrying automatic weapons, wearing no protective gear, no military in the group, using water transport after encountering a hostile reptilia etc.)
3. The ending is ambiguous, but not in a good way. It's not open edned, it's just shot in a way that makes it unclear what happened. Some people compare this to original Solaris and Stalker yet these feel much more complete. It never gives you enough stuff to actually think about.
4. Tone and pacing. It's very different tonally, feels like it doesn't know what it is trying to be. Starts very slow (like good movies do), but the slow is caused mostly by unnecessary scenes that add nothing and are mostly pretentious. Like the movie is trying to act smart but fails. It gets sort of good by the end reveal, but then falls flat again with an ending that fails to provoke an interesting thought. 
5. The look. Most of the time it looks good, I did dislike the lens aberration though, it was hard to see things at times cause of that bubble effect they've used. But this is just a minor complaint.
Movies like this one should plant a seed in your mind, making you think it over and over again for days. I've seen it 2 hrs ago, and the charm is gone.
You can give this a try, but don't expect a Sci-Fi classic, this is not the case.",7,0,1,15 April 2018
The Martian," One more reason not to give up on humankind
","I first saw The Martian in 2015 in a movie theater and I remember enjoying it.
After giving it a re-watch 4 years later I can say I enjoyed it even more.
The best part about this film for me is its emotional package. I love it when a film shares its emotions with you through good screenplay and acting. And The Martian does a great job at this.
The film also deliveres a very hopeful message. There is still good in humankind and as Sean Bean said it in the film - a single life is worth it.
It feels great to see people dealing with the situation through science one problem at a time (as Damon's character put it in the end of the film). Human intelligence and cooperation can work miracles, and as I've said, even one human life is worth all the trouble.
The characters were also great, them being more human (all the humour and interactions) but still logical and thoughtful helped the story.
It is also great that they have made it technical enough to be believable.
Some of the comedy timings and mentions made me burst into laughter (especially the Project Elrond announcement with Sean Bean in one scene).
And while I do think that making this a little darker would've made it better, I still think that The Martian is one of the best movies about human spirit, survival and problem solving.P.S. It was interesting to see how some of the ideas and vistas of The Martian made it into other Ridley Scott's projects like Alien Covenant.",9,1,2,17 August 2019
