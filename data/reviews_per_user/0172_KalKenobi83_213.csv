Fight Club," Finchers,Nortons and Pitts Best!
","Watched Fight Club Oscar Nominee Edward Norton(American History X ) as Jack The Narrator . Also Starred Helena Bonham-Carter(Sweet Revenge) as Marla Singer and Starring Brad Pitt (Legends Of The Fall ) as Tyler Durden. There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999. Also Amazing Production design by Alex McDowell(The Crow), Costume Design By Michael Kaplan(Blade Runner) and Direction By David Fincher(Se7en) Truly His Best Film also we do not talk about this review 9/10",9,0,1,14 October 2014

This is very different take on the Young Adult Novels Films they usually have a female innovator who changes everything like Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games Series and Shailene Woodley's Tris Prior in The Divergent But This time they had a male innovator that i could finally relate what also enjoyed is that is was focused on the males and the situation, no romantic subplot it was all about find answers and getting out of the maze it was somewhat predictable but to me thats good also all the characters were likable and you did care when they died amazing Screenplay by Grant Pierce Meyers(Across The Universe), Costume Design By Simonetta Mariano(Riddick) ,Musical Score By John Paesano(Superman/Batman: Apocalypse ) and Direction By Newcomer Wes Ball , The Best and More Relatable Out of The Young Adult Novel Film Genre 8/10",8,0,1,10 February 2015

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Best Mission Impossible Of All Time!!!
","Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol is the forth film in the franchise and sees Tom Cruise(War Of The Worlds) reprising the leading role of the globe-trotting super spy Ethan Hunt. Throughout the series Hunt has evolved from team player to lone wolf and now in Ghost Protocol he must become a true leader of a team that, for the first time, he didn't choose.The film blasts off into overdrive from the minute the gates open and rarely lets up, it's one hell of a ride and there's enough action and gadgets here to please any fan of the spy film genre. The plot is fairly straightforward; the bad guy obtains the key to the ultimate weapon and plans to destroy the world with it. Hunt and his team, working without the support of the IMF, must stop him at all costs. It has enough twists and turns to keep you engaged but it never gets so complicated that you risk getting lost while you're immersed in the mind- blowing stunt sequences. One thing fans of the series will probably notice this time around is that Hunt is more 'human' when it comes to the action than he has been in most of the previous outings. Not everything goes to plan and if he gets hit or falls down it hurts. Sure he's still a super spy and can do things most mortal men would never try in a million years but the added vulnerability and consequences of those actions gone wrong lifts the film to a new level.but in Mission:Impossible-Ghost Protocol that level of personal rivalry between protagonist and antagonist was a bit lacking. It's not that Michael Nyqvist (Abuduction) didn't deliver a good performance in the few scenes where he interacts with Hunt, it's just that there are so few of these moments that he is, in many ways, almost like another one of his own henchmen and I mistook him for other characters on a few occasions.Simon Pegg (Hot Fuzz) reprises his role as Benji Dunn from MI3, the computer whiz behind all the action. Dunn has now graduated from a 'behind the desk cameo' to a fully qualified field officer and as a result gets a much beefier role in this mission becoming one of Hunt's rogue team. Pegg's natural comedic timing and likable charm adds a much-needed element of lightheartedness to the franchise that could have easily backfired had this role been miscast.Rounding out the new team are IMF agents Paula Patton(Precious) as Jane Carter and Oscar Nominee Jeremy Renner(The Town) as William Brandt, and both actors deliver solid performances. Carter is as sexy as she is deadly and Patton slips between these two persona's with ease while Brandt hides a secret past allowing Renner to show a vulnerability we're not used to seeing in the roles he normally plays.Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol delivers exactly the type of entertainment action fans crave and as a result it is perfect popcorn movie. If you don't enjoy this ride then entertaining you is a mission: impossible. Amazing music by Michael Giacchino (Lost), Costume Design By Michael Kaplan(Fight Club) and Direction By Brad Bird(The Incredibles)The Best The Mission Impossible of all time I doubt MI:5 Can Top it. 9/10",9,2,5,2 October 2014

The film was great had a great balance of Drama,Comedy and Action. I really Enjoyed Pratt as Star Lord who is my favorite Guardian But it was Rocket Raccoon who stool the show I was Laughing every time when he spoke plus he had a funny scene with Quill about Planning, Laughter and Sarcasm. The Henchman Nebula was also she was menacing and feisty she was great also a scene stealer. The Film was good but Drax and Ronan were severely Underdeveloped which it kinda hurt it a bit we got some solid Backstory from the rest of the Guardians but Drax was just there unfortunately. 'Contains Spoiler*Also Ronan was Cool but totally became a pawn in the climax'Contains Spoiler'. Not as a Great as Marvels Previous Adaptations Like The Avengers,Captain America The Winter Soldier,Iron Man,Thor :The Dark World and The Incredible Hulk but Still Noteworthy despite some incomplete Characters 8/10",8,1,3,19 August 2014

Some of the aspects I didn't enjoy was the pervasive Language saying GD every time wasn't Needed also a sex scene between Jake & Neytiri was kinda awkward. spoiler I really Enjoyed the final Fight sequence Between The RDA & The Na'vi Clans it was exciting and One of the best next to To The Battle Of Yavin. Also I enjoyed Sully's and Quatritch Confrontation it was exciting also too see Jake to stand up for the Na'vi People even he was an 'Alien' Spoiler . the amazing Direction From James Cameron(Terminator 2:Judgement Day), Great Musical Score from the Amazing James Horner(Troy) and Great Costume Design from Mayes C.Rubeo(Titanic) & Deborah Lynn Scott(Get Smart) Not as Awesome as Star Wars But definitely a Noteworthy Science Fiction film 8/10",8,3,5,21 September 2014

The Last Samurai," A Japanese Inspired Film That Does it Part Well!
","Watched The Last Samurai Starring Tom Cruise(Rain Man) as Nathan Algren, Billy Connolly(Boondock Saints) as Zebulon Gant, Timothy Spall(Harry Potter) as Simon Graham , Ken Watanabe (Batman Begins) as Lord Moritsugu Katsumoto and Tony Goldwyn(Ghost) as Colonel Bagley Still, 'The Last Samurai' manages to succeed in a number of ways mainly in presenting nineteenth-century Japan in a remarkably realistic way, and in its brutal battle scenes, shot in gory 'Braveheart'-style by the great cinematographer John Toll. It is in these terrifying, agonizing moments of sword-versus-rifle battle that Zwick comes closest to emulating his obvious hero, Akira Kurosawa, and manages to comment on the tragedy and insanity of war.Flashbacks are used unnecessarily to try to enforce Cruise's sense of guilt in participating in the the slaughter of the Indians (so we will understand his desire to defend another endangered species, the Samurai). As the apparent title character, Ken Watanabe pretty much steals the show as Katsumodo, the SAGE warrior leader whom Cruise befriends. A Japanese actress known only as Koyuki plays the heartbreakingly beautiful wife of a Samurai Cruise kills, who Cruise grows close to. But perhaps most amazing of the Japanese cast is the small boy who plays one of her sons. Unexpectedly expressive, emotional, and charming, he's the type of face you would expect to see in a film by the great Kurosawa. Or Lean. Or Ford.All technical aspects, from production and costume design to visual effects, are excellent. Hans Zimmer's score, incorporating traditional wood flutes and thunderous drums, is at times touching and evocative, at times bombastic and unnecessarily loud. All in all, 'The Last Samurai' is an impressive production. And even if it misses being the cinematic classic it strives towards, all involved can be proud of their accomplishment. 8/10",8,1,2,10 October 2014

Ben-Hur," Charlton Hestons Best Film
","The same quality that made epics like 'Star Wars,' 'Lord Of The Rings,' 'Les Miserables,' and, ultimately, 'Titanic' the memorable stories they were is present in spades in 'Ben-Hur.' These are stories, though told on canvases far vaster than the CinemaScope- or Panavision-sized movie screens they were meant for, succeed because, in their best moments, they focus on the interaction between and history of as few as two characters.What begins as a childhood friendship between a Roman boy and a Jewish boy in Roman-occupied Palestine, becomes, briefly, a politically-charged rivalry, and ultimately, a search for revenge by one upon the other.Charlton Heston(The Ten Commandments) and Stephen Boyd(A Hill in Korea) deliver the performances of their careers, and get to chew up scenery and sets of such grandeur that Hollywood could never afford their like again.This film, the greatest epic film ever made, deserves every accolade heaped upon it. The modern viewer may have to apply some patience, but at the end of the nearly four hour running time will find themselves to be vastly rewarded for it. You will find your life changed by both the scale of the film and the intimate message of friendship, betrayal, revenge--and the power of forgiveness 9/10",9,2,4,4 December 2014

The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting. also Great costume Design By Trish Summerville(The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ) , Production Design By Phillip Messina(Oceans 11) , Score By James Newton Howard(The Dark Knight), Screenplay By Simon Beaufoy(Slumdog Millionaire ) and Michael Arndt(Little Miss Sunshine) and Direction Francis Lawrence(SeaBiscuit) An Amazing Second Act 10/10",8,0,14,30 November 2014

Gladiator," Crowes,Scotts Best Picture indeed and a Sword & Sandals Film That defines The Genre
","Watched one of All time Favorite Ridley Scott Films thats Gladiator one of my favorite Revenge/Sword & Sandals flick Films Featured an Amazing Performance from a Stellar Lead By Russell Crowe(L.A. Confidential ) as Maximus a former General Betrayed then turned Gladiator.

Arguably crowes best film the story is filled with epic period spectacle when we go from the smaller arenas to the The roman the story also moves forward in a grand way amazing performance from Crowe as the Anger filled Maximus. Great Production design from Arthur Max(G.I.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Best Out Of The Indiana Jones Series!!
","Watched Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade was, in my opinion, the best movie of the Indiana Jones Series. This movie featured the same type of humor we have become accustomed to from Dr. Jones, as well as another beautiful woman also the best Indy girl and lots of great action scenes! This movie starts with River Phoenix(Stand By Me) as Teenage Indy which gives us a look at an event that molds his life and character as well as his relationship with his father, Played By 007 Himself Sean Connery(Dr.No) We also learn he is a 'Junior' and that he hates to be called that.Back as an adult, Indy's father is kidnapped and he must set out to find him. His only clues are his father's diary notes, which were mysteriously sent to him earlier that day. They lead him to Italy, where he meets the gorgeous German blonde, Alison Doody(A View To Kill) as Dr. Elsa Schneider , who becomes an integral part of this story.Once again, the grown up Harrison Ford(Blade Runner) as Indiana Jones does battle with the Nazis. Apparently, Adolf Hitler is after the Holy Grail, which contains the blood of Christ. So Indiana and his father team up to get there first. Along the way, there is a great action scene where Jones fights a few Nazis on board a moving tank.Overall, as I mentioned earlier, I believe this to be the best Indiana Jones movie of the three. This action movie was good long before movie studios learned to make the great CGI and special effects. It's effects were pretty good anyways but back in 1989, things just did not look as good as they can make them today. Still, highly recommended and worth your time and also amazing Score From John Williams(Star Wars) and Direction From Steven Spielberg(Jaws). 9/10",9,2,3,2 October 2014

The film was brilliant showcasing the Roaring 20's as it was when Liquor was cheaper during the era of probation and Gatsby's parties showed why it was roaring. The one aspect of the film i enjoyed was Nick Caraway's interpretation of the events that would unfold it gave us as an audience to help understand the mysterious Gatsby. Also Another Incredible performance By Leonardo DiCaprio as The Mysterious Jay Gatsby. it was really cool to see the Dynamic between Caraway and Gatsby how they both perceived each other and it was interesting to see how there relationship would unfold in the film and great performance by newcomer Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan Baker the scary Siren according to Nick Caraway. The film was great but it did suffer from pacing issues and not establishing certain plot points when they needed to be but Caraways Narration kept in check.

The film was great it showed that drafting isn't a Player isn't simple as is to us fans there are whole lot variables a pick can be First Round Gem or Bust also really enjoyed seeing the inter workings of the front office that most the NFL General Managers are key in teams success as well and get a lot pressure from not only the Owner(s) but by the fans themselves it was also it was interesting to see when A Team Trades Picks to To Another Team that both teams hinges on that and it's not a split second decision many variables are needed to see if these Picks will help determine the Teams future in terms of winning,Playoff Appearances.it was also cool seeing the veteran Players and coaches perspective of the draft knowing if someone drafted a first rounder Quarterback he might take over that players position also seeing A Coach might want to stick to his veterans than draft a rookie quarterback also it was interesting to see sometimes The General Manager / Head Coach have different Opinions on the teams future and success. The film was one of my favorite Sports Movies also great direction by Ivan Reitman(Ghosterbusters), Great score by John Debney(Iron Man 2) and Great Costume design By Frank L.
