Scarface," TOUGH AND MEAN, SCARFACE IS TERRIFIC
","'SCARFACE' is a really great movie and I wonder why this movie was trashed by the critics. I read most of the users comments and almost everybody agreed that this movie is a masterpiece. Is it because of the excessive use of the profanity or the violence, I don't think that this is necessarily a good reason to hate this movie. It's a very entertaining movie and realistic. Al Pacino gives one of his strongest performances He changed his look completely 'I couldn't recognize him' and I think that he should have at least gotten an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Tony Montana.",Null,0,0,11 August 1999
The Godfather," I am gonna make him an offer he can't refuse
","Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece features Marlon Brando in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone, the head of the Corleone crime family and his efforts to hold up his empire. Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall gave a career making perfomances.It's a great movie even though Coppola and Mario Puzo made the criminals look beatiful despite their ugly crime business.",Null,0,1,19 May 1999
