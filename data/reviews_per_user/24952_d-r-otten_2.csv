Blade Runner 2049," Impressive!
","This is one of the most impressive movie I 've seen in a long time. Like the old Blade Runner it's an art-house/cult movie and not a movie for the 'popcorn audience'. Visually perfect and the music is very dreamy and fits with the environment the movie is showing. Some say that the story is slow. It is if you compare it with the Marvel and DC movies. But I think it needs to be like this because there is a story that need to be told. Compared with the old Blade Runner movie, this one is on all fronts better. My advise is to watch it many times because it's a movie with many layers. A Masterpiece in my opinion!",10,8,18,21 October 2017
It," Coming of age mixed with horror!
","I really enjoyed this movie! Don't compare the Pennywise in this movie with the Pennywise performed by Tim Curry in the mini series. Bill Skarsgard did an excellent job to create a completely different pennywise. Here it's a clown with some kind of unpredictable behaviour. He switch fast from a childlike innocence appearance to a monster with a psychedelic smile and multiple rows of sharp teeth. But it's not pennywise who steels the show. This is more a coming of age movie and the young actors are performing absolutely amazing. The story lines of the young actors are worked out very carefully and I'm glad that the part with their grown up selves will be continued in the next movie, chapter two. I recommend everybody to see this movie but don't expect a slasher horror movie.",8,3,5,23 September 2017
