Blade Runner 2049," Like this review, the movie's too long and boring!
","I went to see this movie with my mother, who told me that it was a sequel to the original movie, and it wasn't supposed to be as good as the original, which is to be expected; it's very rare that you find a sequel that is as good, if not better, than the original! However, I haven't seen the original, nor did I know what it was about. I didn't even look up the synopsis or read the reviews for this one before going to see it, so I went into it blind, not knowing what to expect.The movie started off rather slowly, and I don't mind some slow scenes if they've got a point to them, but there comes a point in time where you've just got to get a move on and not draw it out any more! The movie continued with slow scenes, which bored me out of my mind; I was yawning and wanted to curl up and fall asleep! However, the action scenes were good, and the mystery was there – it had me guessing as to who the child was, and I had two guesses, which were wrong. If I was paying more attention, I would have pin-pointed it as soon as I saw the adult version.That's the problem, though; the movie was so boring and slow that I switched my mind off, and I even missed some bits due to being distracted by something else!Some of the scenes were so drawn out and slow that it almost made me feel as if they were just plonked there as fillers; it made no sense as to why they were there! Also, the fight scene between Deckard and Agent K made no sense to me at all. I understand that Deckard would want to protect himself and his home, so it made sense that he would fight Agent K for a moment, but why draw it out? The fight sequence felt emotionless and too choreographed; there seemed to be no point behind it than to get testosterone out! One punch stop for an awkward moment another punch stop for an awkward moment This went on, though Agent K had stated his intentions. The fight continued to the entertainment/cabaret room, and it just felt like an opportunity to display holograms of various musical acts. The only comical point was when Deckard says that he loves the current song playing, but even that seemed out of place!The climax with Agent K, Deckard and that lady from Tyrell was an anti- climax! Sure, Agent K managed to kill her, but Deckard couldn't get out of those cuffs and help (either he couldn't, or he just wasn't trying hard enough)! It kind of feels unrealistic, too; the lady stabbed Agent K multiple times, yet he still had such strength and was able to kill her, no bleeding out in the water, and only died later? Dude!I was a bit confused during the movie as to what was going on and its purpose, and it was pointed out that it might be a movie that you have to see more than once to get a full grasp on what's happening. Like Catch me if you can.Is it really worth paying more money and seeing again, though? Would I recommend it to someone to see? Would I recommend a die-hard fan see it?I gave this movie five stars due to the fact that there was some mystery there and Harrison Ford was in it.I would recommend this movie, but to only be viewed once, and maybe after it's come out on DVD and the price has been dropped. Maybe I'm being too harsh in my review, but I wouldn't see it again; it's not worth spending all that money again. As far as the die-hard fans go, maybe give this one a miss and just re-watch the original.I just read another review, which make good points, and read that they're planning to make this into a franchise, meaning more movies. If that's the case, please don't! Most sequels don't live up to their potential and come near the first one, and this sequel was no exception. If they came up with a poor story-line and execution for this movie, what, or who, is to say that any other movie in this franchise will be any better?",5,4,7,5 November 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Not worth a re-watch.
","Let me start out by saying that I haven't seen the original movie, so this review is purely based on the movie at hand.I saw this on Netflix and thought that I'd give it a go, especially seeing as I'd missed the beginning on television. I'm one of those people who has to see the beginning! However, with this one, it wouldn't have mattered much.The casting was good, but could still have been better! However, it was good to see John Goodman in a dark role, as we're so used to seeing him in a light, comedic role (at least, I am)!The movie starts off as a mystery (warning: if you don't want spoilers, don't read any further):
A woman wakes up in a bunker and is told by Howard (Goodman), who is a stranger at the time, that the air is polluted and, because of that, nobody else survived, therefore there's no-one looking for her. She is introduced to Emmett and the audience wonders whether or not he's Howard's accomplice. Howard passes Michelle some clothes claiming that it was another girl's clothes, but admits that they're his daughters, who used to love to design, as does Michelle, but her mother turned her against him and took her to Chicago. Michelle finds a picture of the former 'housemate' who is 'no longer with us' and questions whether it really is Howard's daughter, or another woman who went missing and was never heard from again. Is Howard just bonkers?It was boring at the beginning, but picked up during the middle. It just lost me by the end, though, as it went from a murder mystery to a... sci-fi. Michelle then goes to combat with no prior combative experience, just because she heard someone's pleas over the radio. What a ridiculous decision!The writers and director clearly didn't have a clear vision for the movie and couldn't iron out the plot holes, or even tie them up in a neat bow! Would I re-watch or even recommend this movie to anybody? No.",2,0,0,15 June 2018
Child 44," Wow!
","This was a brilliant movie, but also sad and terrifying! The acting was amazing, as were the script and direction! I wish I could give this movie more stars, but, unfortunately, I can't.This film is far from a movie to which you could sit back, kick your heels off and relax with a wine, turning your mind off; it's full of feeling and a real tearjerker, depicting what life must have been like in a communist society run by Stalin.",10,0,1,3 February 2019
Insidious," Like a good scare? You've come to the right place!
","Thrillers these days leave a lot to be desired and aren't very memorable, mostly because of the acting, which, in turn is made horrible because of the script. Considering this, I went into this movie with low expectations (despite going onto IMDB to gather the overall score and skipping the reviews). But...The film was brilliantly written and cast really well! It was suspenseful with low lighting (brilliant) and had me jumping out of my seat at every turn, if not turning my volume down! If you like a good and truly scary movie, then this is it!I can't wait to see the sequel, though sequels are generally known to be worse than the original. But I will give it a go and see how I like it (I'm expecting big things from it, so it'd better no disappoint!)",10,0,0,24 March 2018
P.S. I Love You," P.S. One of -if not *the*- most moving movies of all time!
","Holly Kennedy (Hilary Swank, 'The Gift', 'Million Dollar Baby') is a widow who's trying to move on with her life after the sudden, but unpreventable death of her husband, Gerry (Gerard Butler, 'Phantom of the Opera' and '300'), with the help from her family and friends; and of course, letter's from her late husband, which are always signed off with 'P.S. I love you', hence the movie (and book) title. About three weeks after her beloved husband's funeral Holly mysteriously receives a cake and audio tape from him, which has come from 'beyond the grave', which kick off a whirlwind of a year of letters (one for each month and special event), adventures, misery and a period for Holly to find herself. Gerry sends Holly, Denise (Lisa Kudrow, 'Friends') and Sharon (Gina Gershon, 'What Love Is') to Ireland where they planned to have a wonderful but quiet time but instead meet William Gallapher, Gerry's best mate, and without realizing who he is, Holly ends up sleeping with him. Holly also goes to see her in-laws and learn a bit more about them and how they felt about her and her relationship with their son. She also finds out something a bit unexpected: the messenger of all those letters from Gerry.Most of all, this movie is the most moving movies of all time! And it's a *MUST* SEE!It also stars Kathy Bates ('Rumour Has it'), Harry Connick Jr. ('Will & Grace', 'Bug') and James Marsters ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Angel', 'Smallville')Great story, movie and stellar cast!",10,0,1,9 May 2008
The Conjuring," This is what nightmares are made of!
","I have never seen this movie or its advertising, so I was going in blind, and quite pleasantly surprised!There are many horror and thriller flicks out there, and it's hard to pick just one, but horror and thriller flicks, these days, have become soft, revealing way too much before the end, especially the antagonist. It's always the same story-line: a group of friends go out to a secluded cabin in the woods where a bunch of scary stuff happens, and the antagonist, who is usually shown from behind or as a silhouette as he (or she) carries out his evil deeds, is always one of the friends! Usually the antagonist, as well as a group member, is a jilted lover.I really need to give James Wan, the director, credit here for bringing Chad and Carey's vision to life creatively, and surrounding himself with the right kind of people who support him; the film is really well executed! While other directors give way too much away before the movie even begins, James doesn't give anything away easily – it's not until much later that you find out the who and why!Wan may give you glimpses of who is antagonising the family in the second act, but not fully until the third.Wan also ties in previous events throughout the movie and references other horror flicks, most notably being Annabelle. Whether or not it is actually based on true events, it's a great movie and will have you on the edge of your seats with your heart pumping, jumping at the right moments, skin crawling, eyes bulging and palms sweaty. Everything you want in a horror flick!I hope more of James, Chad and Carey's movies are as thrilling and horrifying as this one was and still is! I can't wait to watch the Conjuring 2!",10,0,0,27 September 2017
