Saturday Night Fever," Cancel, Tony Manero! Another classic that couldn't be made in today's culture
","This feels more like a documentary than a movie. The film touches on so many urban issues including classism, religion, racism, peer-pressure, jealousy, rivalry, rebellion, respect, unprotected sex and rape, in a way that feels honest and not contrived. It's not trying to make a statement about these social issues it's just showing you realistic characters that deal with it. I see a lot of people that like the film hail Tony as a hero and a lot of people that hate it decry him as a shallow idiot. I view him more as a tragic character that sees the path he's going down isn't the right one, but doesn't quite know how to deal with it. He's not happy with the man he is, but doesn't quite know how to change into the man he wants to be. Movies that try to accomplish these things intentionally come off pretentious and ham fisted. This movie was just and honest slice of life story with a great lead performance and its realism lead to its depth. Yes, the amazing soundtrack and dance sequences are the reason why it became a blockbuster and a cultural phenomenon, but even without them this movie would have been a cult classic and time capsule of the late 70s.",10,1,1,7 May 2020
Mulan," My very involved reasoning on why I liked but didn't love this movie
","It seems what makes this movie stand out to most of its fans is the fact that Mulan is a female action hero and not a rich princess, she's Asian and not white and it shows little girls that they can and should be treated equally as boys. However, I'm not a kid, I don't have kids, I'm not a sexist, or a racist, so none of these things affects me looking at this as anything more than just a cartoon. A cartoon that's the intellectual property of a multibillion-dollar company that had nothing more in mind than making the most money they could by exploiting a market of fans dissatisfied with the status quo that Disney themselves perpetuated with movies that had white women waiting for a rich handsome prince charmings to save them. They did those movies when it served them and stopped when it didn't. I don't say that try and sound like I've found out their big secret, I say that to say this movie is just okay to me, because of MY perspective. However, I do respect and understand that there are other ways of looking at this movie that would elevate it to others. But just not me, Eddie Murphy was funny, the villain was pretty forgettable and the love story was so tacked on that if felt like something done in protest, as if they filmmakers said, this is my movie and if you cut it off here it's done, but let it play a few minutes more and you have the studio mandated ending, but I also could be way off. Not bad, not great, good.",8,0,0,22 February 2020
Shaun of the Dead," The dreaded 'Horror Comedy.'
","I wished this movie would have been labelled a 'Romantic Comedy' or a 'Buddy Comedy' or any other comedy except the dreaded 'Horror Comedy.' A genre which horror fans and comedy fans alike seem to despise and this might have been considered a mainstream hit instead of a cult film, which everyone how sees it likes it, but not enough people actually see it.",10,1,1,23 April 2020
Superbad," Probably my favorite apple off of the Judd Apatow tree of comedy.
","In this crass in-your-face sex comedy, the thing that really makes it stand out to me (aside from the humor of course), is the subtext to everything we're watching. The problem with most movies like this is they have a-hole lead characters and they drift from gag to gag until a slapped on ending with fake sincerity in which the jerks we've been watching the entire film turn out to be great guys all along. However, with Superbad, I'm rooting for all of these characters from beginning to the end when we see schlubby Jonah Hill somehow land Emma Stone, I'm rolling with it.",10,0,0,24 March 2020
Grease," Prefect! Despite not really being a movie.
","At times it feels more like a collection of music videos than a movie. With paper thin characters, no real plot, forward movement, drama or conflict. Sure, things come up that seem like they put our heroes in a difficult spot. Pressure to have sex, dropping out of school, teenage pregnancy, a potential deadly drag race, a gang fight, but then you look down at your phone for a text or tweet and you completely missed the 5 seconds of runtime the filmmakers took to resolve said issue before the next musical number. So why do we or I all love this movie so much? I think when you have really likable characters you don't want to see anything bad happen to them, especially teenagers. Because we've all been at that point in our lives where our future is ahead of us, we think we know it all, we think the friends and loves we have at that time will be there for the rest of our lives. However, we now know almost all of those things are false and our parents that we rebelled against so much for telling us what to do were right about almost everything they warned us about, but man oh man wouldn't it be cool if our past selves or these characters were right? So yeah, much like, 'may the force be with you' and 'I'll be back.' 'Grease is the word!'",10,1,1,24 February 2020
American Psycho," Bale at his best
","When it comes to adaptations, unless it's comic books, I'm someone who has almost never read the books. Having done so for Game of Thrones I now see what book readers gripe about. The movies are almost never, just as good or better. With that said, I have not read American Psycho so take my opinion for what it is. I liked the film and I loved Bale's performance. It made me a fan of his work. I hope to find the time to read the book some day and when I do I will revisit the film and revise my opinion.",8,2,3,13 February 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Fan service the movie!
","On first viewing you love how everything is tied up. Stop there! If you've only seen this movie once do yourself a favor and don't ever watch it again. On second viewing this is a below average overly long film in which very little happens in a bloated second act. The only thing that still stands up is the Avengers trinity of Thor, Captain America and Iron Man versus Thanos, but it real makes you question the power levels of these characters, Thanos took them all out with no stones. The time travel subplot has more holes than swiss cheese I don't care how much screen time they gave explaining it and 'joking' about it, I quote joking because in the MCU references count as jokes. There's the soul stone, in the last movie you had to make a sacrifice, how is Black Widow's suicide a Hawkeye sacrifice? How does Thanos not feel all 5 stones leaving his glove? Why so much build up about the glove in the previous movies if Iron Man can make one in a few hours, there's more, there's so much more but, at the end of the day Disney's 3-hour infomercial manage to make billions of dollars while not anger China or SJWs in the porcess, so for that alone this was impressive.",4,7,9,7 May 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," This movie is a kid emptying his toy box on the floor
","Once you get past how cool it is to see all these characters on screen together, this movie is very lacking. The characters have no consistency, the deaths are hollow and are just there for shock value since we all know they won't say dead, the power levels of the characters and the stones fluctuate to fit what the plot needs. This is a very flawed film, but with that said I still think it's the best marvel film by far. The action and Thor's subplot are both good and Thanos is great, his character holds the movie together.",8,0,0,7 May 2020
Jerry Maguire," A great romantic-comedy/sports film that couldn't be made today.
","Back in the 1990s a boss having sex with his younger employee was a love story. A female reporter in a men's locker room was used for comedy. A professional athlete playing through multiple concussions for a big contract was heroic. Obviously, none of those things would be accepted in a mainstream studio movie today. However, if a modern viewer gives this movie a chance they'll find it to be a heartwarming tear jerker, with memorable scenes, lines and catchphrases that live on today. To name just a few, 'Show me the money!' 'I love black people!' 'Help me, help you.' 'You complete me.' 'You had me at hello.' See Tom Cruise at his best, Cuba Gooding Jr. in his Oscar winning role. The world introduction to director Cameron Crowe and actress Rene√© Zellweger. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend you do and if you have I highly recommend seeing it again soon because it's worth a revisit.",10,0,1,25 February 2020
Sinister," it's okay
","Judging it as a movie it's pretty repetitive, cliched, illogical and the lead character is as always in these movies is very stupid. Judging it as a popcorn horror movie, it's definitely above average, it could have been better if it had an R-rating and shaved off 20 minutes.",6,0,0,24 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," An average movie that came out at the perfect time
","Not a big Star Wars fan, but like everyone else I've seen the movies a few times, recently watched this again and man does it not hold up well. All of the sudo British accents and posh attitudes that some of the characters had that were quickly abandoned halfway through the movie. The worst being Carrie Fisher, it was hard to ignore and even harder to give it a pass. The movie had great timing. A few years after the Vietnam War ended and also at the tail end of the Hollywood New Wave that consisted of long artsy serious bleak films that focused on drama and character development. Suddenly here's this action-packed space adventure with robots, space ships, swords, chosen ones, ancient myths wise old men, bad guys in all black, good guys in all white, turn your brain off adventure. Looking back now it's an average movie with a lot of holes in the logic and filmmaking.",5,0,0,10 May 2020
Cube," An interesting premise that ultimately goes nowhere.
","Bad dialogue, hammy acting, contrived drama, yeah, this movie has its flaws, but considering it was made on a budget of around $300,000 U.S. with unknown actors, it's pretty impressive once it's put into context. I love the use of the 'No Exit' premise from the Jean-Paul Sartre play that's been used in The Twilight Zone and I myriad of other films, but lack of creativity in the ending showed that there likely wasn't much more the filmmakers had in mind past the premise, which is disappointing.",7,0,0,7 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best movie in an overrated franchise
",40 years later and Disney with all of it billions of dollars still can't make a Star Wars film that comes close to this.,10,0,0,10 May 2020
Her," Student film with a Hollywood Budget
","This comes off like a student film, elevated by great talent in-front of and behind the camera. If you follow the emotional through line it will be a very satisfying experience, however if you use any real thought or logic, it's pretty stupid and pretentious. From Joaquin Phoenix's character falling in love with is operating system to him turning down a drunk and horny Olivia Wilde. It's really farfetched, but it's all played straight and earnestly and if you can keep your willing suspension of disbelief it's a great film.",10,0,0,24 March 2020
