50 First Dates," Good date movie
","I think that '50 first dates' had some really funny parts at the start, they were kinda random but it worked out well. As the movie went on it it was more about the relationship between Adam and Drew. It was a really good date movie, very cute for the girls and funny for the guys. Good stuff, I enjoyed it.",7,0,0,22 February 2004
The Butterfly Effect," could have been better
","The butterfly effect could have been a really great movie had the script and the actors been better. I went in to this movie excited to see it hoping that it would be the dark movie that it had been portrayed as. At the beginning, it was good. I thought that it would be a really good movie. However when the charters got older the story got worse as did the acting. By the end of it, I wasn't totally disapointed but i wasn't completely happy either. It was the same as every other movie that has been coming out recently, a disapointment. When will hollywood start making some better movies? We can only wait and hope.",6,1,1,27 January 2004
Donnie Darko," Strange and beautiful
","I really enjoyed this movie, it has a wonderful story even if it is a tab bit confusing. I first fell in love with this movie when I stumbled upon it on HBO, it caught my attention because of the bizarre story line and beautiful shots. Right away, I could see that it was something other than the norm and that's what I liked about it. If you like strange story lines, you should look at this movie.",Null,0,0,11 December 2003
