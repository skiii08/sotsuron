Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good special effects,but nothing special otherwise
","After all the hype, I allowed myself to be dragged along to see this film. It was as I suspected, all hype, no substance. When I saw the original 'Star Wars', I was knocked out. I was knocked out again when I saw 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Return Of The Jedi' The plots were simple, and the special effects (crude by today's standard of course), didn't get in the way of the story. With the new film, I feel it's the other way around.Yes, the special effects are amazing. So spectacular as to divert this viewer's attention from what was actually going on; not that I felt involved, either.Over the next few years, there'll be episode two and three.Count me out! Sorry, George. I think you should have quit while you were still ahead.",Null,0,1,19 October 1999
In Bruges," Another terrific film from the U.K.
","This is the first feature film of director Martin McDonagh. His previous foray into film was the short, 'Six Shooter' which, come to think of it, would be an ideal addition when 'In Bruges' is released on DVD. 'In Bruges' is a superior English gangster film, similar, but not an echo of those two other great English gangster films, 'The Long Good Friday' and 'Sexy Beast' Indeed, the Harry Waters character played with venomous realism by Ralph Fiennes is strikingly similar to the Don Logan character (played with even more toxicity by Ben Kingsley), in 'Sexy Beast' But there is where any resemblance ends. Whereas the 'The Long Good Friday' was about power and how easily it can slip through one's fingers, and 'Sexy Beast' was about a retired criminal being persuaded to carry out one last job, 'In Bruges' is about the aftermath of a 'hit.' Ray and Ken (Farrell and Gleeson respectively), play two hit men. The film opens with postcard scenes of the old city of Bruges in Belgium, while a voice over explains why these two men find themselves in this ancient city. Ken is the more pragmatic of the two. He is quite content to do a spot of 'sightseeing.'while awaiting further instructions. Ray on the other hand, thinks Bruges is a dump. Ray just wants to get back to the city he was born in, Dublin. But, as the film progresses, it's gradually revealed why both men have to hang around, till they receive these 'further instructions.' When the instructions finally comes, is not what we expect. Both Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell, are terrific, especially Farrell as Ray. The supporting cast is equally good  Jordan Prentice as 'Jimmy, Zeljko Ivanek as the 'Canadian', and Eric Godon as 'Yuri' There were a few instances in the film I found somewhat confusing  but to list them would be both superfluous, unnecessary, and would spoil other film goers enjoyment. 'In Bruges' is a rollicking yarn, expertly crafted, with great dialogue and many an unexpected plot twist. I recommend it unreservedly.",8,2,5,26 November 2008
Fight Club," gruesome and grubby
","David Fincher's 'Fight Club' is a pretty grubby film.The violence is extremely graphic and, a lot of the time, totally unnecessary. Seven minutes has been trimmed from the film here in Australia - whether by the Commonwealth censor, or the local distributor, I don't know. What I do know is that even in its truncated form, I can understand why it was cut so heavily. Then again, I saw it on video, and maybe it was the cinema version that had the seven minutes removed. Either way, the logic that men can find meaning in their lives by beating the crap out of each other, seems ridiculous to this viewer. If the film follows the book, it's one book I won't bother reading. And, after watching 'Fight Club', I wish I hadn't bothered hiring that, either.",Null,1,3,12 March 2001
Pirate Radio," All at sea
","When Radio Caroline began broadcasting rock 'n' roll from a boat anchored off the east coast of England in 1964, the BBC's virtual monopoly of the nation's airwaves disappeared, virtually overnight. These 'pirate radio stations' as the government so scathingly called them, played the kind of music teenagers in England wanted to hear, but had been denied to them ever since Guglielmo Marconi invented the radio. It's almost impossible to describe how 'energizing' it was to be able to turn on the radio at any time of the day or night, and hear that good old rock 'n' roll blasting out of your radio's speakers. Sadly, it couldn't last. In 1967, the government passed the Marine & Broadcasting Act making it illegal for Radio Caroline to continue operating, despite the fact that the boat was anchored in International Waters, which should have made them immune to government interference.'The Boat That Rocked' should have been a humdinger, considering the impact 'pirate radio stations' had on the British Broadcasting Industry as well as the major record labels at the time, not to mention how popular they were with listeners. Unfortunately 'The Boat That Rocked' is anything but. Actors can only work with the script they've been given: a good script, a satisfying film. A bad script, and a film, just like the boat, will sink faster than the Titanic. Excluding the remarkable Philip Seymour Hoffman, (The Count) who hardly ever turns in a less than professional performance, by comparison, the other actors are less than believable in their roles: to be perfectly frank, they come across as mere one-dimensional caricatures. Richard Curtis, the director of such light, fluffy confections such as 'Notting Hill', 'Bridget Jone's Diary' is here clearly out of his depth. Quick! Throw him a life jacket, someone! The bulk of the film's running time is taken up treading water, as it were, with one comic set-up after another, none of which are all that funny. Only the last half hour or so makes 'The Boat That Rocks' worth watching, but by then you can be forgiven for wishing that you'd baled out long ago.",4,0,2,24 May 2012
Chicken Run," A feather in their caps
","From the creators of 'Wallace & Grommit', comes 'Chicken Run' Basically, 'Chicken Run' is 'The Great Escape', only with chickens. What could be more simple (or hilarious), than that? Like the Aardman series, 'Wallace & Grommit', 'Chicken Run' is full of the kind of sly humour the English are so good at creating. What more can one say? It's a feather (sorry), in the caps of the folk at Dreamworks, who gave Nick Park and his team to not only make the first claymation feature film, but to make one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time",Null,0,0,8 March 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Disappointed
","I'm probably going against the current consensus of opinion when I state that I didn't find 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', that satisfying a film. Granted, the action sequences are very good. However, over the years, I've seen a few 'martial arts' films, that have been just as spectacularly staged ('The Fate of Lee Kahn', 'Dragon Gate Inn', and 'Five Fingers Of Death', are three that immediately come to mind).The plot device, that of a 'student' set on avenging the death of his 'master', is common to most 'martial arts/kung fu' films, and is no different in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', as it is in the most rudimentary of 'Ninja' films that clutter up the shelves at my local video store.I agree that the photography is wonderful. The scenery is breath-taking, yet I found the film peculiarly 'empty' This is a great pity, as director Ang Lee has made some fine films.",Null,0,0,19 March 2001
The Insider," Russell Crowe is up there at the top
","This film is worth seeing just for Russell Crowe's performance as 'whistle blower', Jeffrey Wigand. The first Russell Crowe film I saw, was 'Romper Stomper' Then, another Australian film: 'The Sum of Us' Two totally different roles, both of which he handled with aplomb.Next thing I know, he's acting alongside Kevin Spacey in 'L.A. Confidential', which, I thought was his best role to date. Then along came:'The Insider' Pacino is good, as always. Christopher Plummer is brilliant as Mike Wallace (he even looks like him), but Russell Crowe outshines them all. He looks and acts the part of a man on the edge. He has a well paid job. A good life style (on the surface, at least). He also is deeply unhappy about the business ethics (tobacco companies have ethics?) of his superiors, and he's prepared to put all that on the line; to blow the whistle. Jeffrey Wigand was a very courageous man, and it's a tribute to Russell Crowe's acting that you think it's Wigand himself, up on the screen. A few quibbles: The film was a little too 'preachy' read: 'heavy-handed', when dealing with the evils of cigarette smoking - the scene where the 'seven dwarfs' are testifying before a Congressional (Senate?) Committee, needed only to be shown once, in my opinion. That aside, 'The Insider' is a powerful film, and Michael Mann, a very underrated director - it's been a long time between 'Heat', and this, and before 'Heat'? 'The Keep', or was it 'Thief'?",Null,0,0,13 March 2000
Sweet and Lowdown," More a let down than 'lowdown'
","I found Woody Allen's latest film, 'Sweet & Lowdown', a bit of a disappointment myself. Sean Penn's portrayal of jazz guitarist, Emmet Ray notwithstanding, I still felt that the film was neither fish nor fowl - more a hybrid, actually. Is it meant to be a documentary (homage?) to a long forgotten jazz musician (Woody Allen plays clarinet in a jazz band)? The brief appearances of jazz historian, Nat Hentoff, suggests it is. The appearance of Woody Allen (with tongue firmly implanted in his cheek), suggests otherwise. This, despite it being beautifully photographed. The music is terrific, and unlike other music bio's, it looks like Penn is really playing the guitar. I think that this film is akin to Woody taking a 'break' between 'Celebrity', and his next, hopefully, more meatier offering",Null,0,0,29 July 2000
