The Benchwarmers," Great
","Every so often you come across a movie so funny that you're not even sure what was the funniest scene in the movie. This movie is one of them. Like a fat man after a mile run I couldn't catch my breath for most of the movie because I was laughing so hard. The all-star cast of Rob Schneider, David Spade, and John Heder did not disappoint. The amazing story is about 3 men who play against young kids in a tournament because they used to be geeks. Rob Schneider does really well in this movie. Benchwarmer is his first staring role in a movie since his critically acclaimed blockbuster Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo. David Spade and John Heder perform very well also. This movie is great for any audience and you should see it as soon as possible.Vote Rob Schneider for sexiest performance on the MTV movie Award!!!",8,0,1,30 April 2006
The New World," This movie is 135 mins long but you'll want to leave after 15
","This movie is the worst movie i have seen in a long time. This movie is like having diarrhea. You don't know why but you get the urge to go. You go and take your seat. After a minute you realize its gonna be bad. After five you realize your gonna be there for a long time. After ten minutes you realize that its the same thing you've seen before just feels and smells worse. And finally at the end you realize look back what just happened and the only thing that flashes through your mind is a load of turd. What i mean is that this movie is bad. You've see this story before just done better. For the entire movie you're wondering when its gonna end. I had to leave during the movie just to check how much longer i would have to sustain this torture. The acting was bad. Colin Farrel acts the same way he always does. Bad. Whats even worse is that people probably go to this movie to see him and hes only in half the movie. For the entire movie we have to watch a girl who we only hear speak 30 mins from the end. The movie was an ongoing trail of boredom. MAybe if you keep your expectations very low, i mean very low, than you might thinks its good. But even thats pushing it. The movie is 135 mins long and about 20 mins of that is actually important. The other 115 mins of the movie are scenes of Pocahontas and JOhn Smith together over and over and over and over again. In conclusion, don't watch this movie. For the first time in my life i see that the Amish have it made because they wont have the chance of watching this.",1,6,13,26 February 2006
Spider-Man 3," Blew me away
","I probably started on the wrong foot because from the title of this comment, you would be led to believe that i liked this movie, just i was led to believe that this was gonna be a good movie. Boy was i wrong. I HATED this movie. Everything was so far from expected it really did blow me away. For starters, the bad acting. Emotion is this movie is scarcer than food in Ethiopia. They could have shown a slideshow of the comics and gotten more emotion, than any of these actors could dish out. The lines were horrible as well. I've seen better lines at an opening to a Steven Segal movie. The montage, which is usually the most redeeming part of any movie, was more out of place than a third nipple. The CGI, which, from a $250 million, should have been great turned out to be worse than any of the last two. I have seen more STD's that are more eye pleasing. The worst part is that it killed the series in front of my eyes. On IMDb, under this movies genres, there are about 60 genres listed. Sad part is, things like drama, crying, singing, dancing, and some more crying, were not listed in this part even though these things took up more time during the movie than all the action sequences put together. Im thankful the movie ended before i got to see anymore of Tobey Maguire trying to cry for the tenth time in a movie. Honestly, i thought i was supposed to have action. Spiderman only get into one or two real fights. ALl of the other scenes of action is him getting his ass kicked over and over. Im sad to say i paid to see this. Hopefully you wont make the same mistake.",1,49,94,4 May 2007
The Pianist," A movie making clinic
","Where do i begin. This movie did everything right and had all its bases covered. The acting was superb, the action was great, not overly funny, and the cgi was jaw-dropping. In this movie the main actor, who is Adrian Brody, is a writer(pianist) for movies. After he gets bamboozled into writing(playing the piano) a movie for his friend, he is cast upon a ship writing(playing the piano) a movie as they approach the island(Germany) where they will shoot it. Naturally, he falls in love with the main woman in the movie who is also the main actor in the movie he is writing(playing the piano) a script for. When they get to the island(Germany), they are captured by the natives(Nazis) and the girl he falls in love with gets sacrificed to a gigantic gorilla(the German Army). For the rest of the movie, they run through the jungle(Germany) trying to find his girl that was taken by the gigantic gorilla(the German Army). Eventually, they manage to capture the giant gorilla(German Army) and take it back to New York(Poland) to show it to the people for money> Obviously, the gigantic gorilla(German Army) gets loose in New York(Poland). When the gigantic gorilla(German Army) gets to the top of the Empire State Building(some big building in Poland), A bunch of planes come and shoot it down. When the gigantic gorilla(German Army) dies, the movie ends. Thats it. All in all i recommend the Pianist to anyone.",8,0,2,10 July 2007
