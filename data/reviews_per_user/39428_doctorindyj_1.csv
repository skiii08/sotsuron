Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Can't beat it with a stick!
","Put all your pre-concieved notions aside before you see this film. More to the point dismiss everything the critics have been saying about this film.That said, this is a truly spectactular film, visually and otherwise. The story is tight and though there are a few glitches in the storyline, they are easily ignored. Unless of course that's all you have to do all day. One major flaw is that the film could have done without the final space battle sequence. On the issue of Jar-Jar, well what can you say. You either hate him or like him. There doesn't seem to be any in between. However many kids I know really like him, and even some adults. Who should not watch this film? Sci-Fi fans who like films along the lines of Aliens and The Matrix. If you want blood letting and bullets flying left and right all over the place, then skip this movie. It's definitely not for the T&A, violence loving fan boys. However, if you are looking for a good story, visually stunning effects and some interesting characters, then this movie is for you!",10,0,0,4 June 2000
