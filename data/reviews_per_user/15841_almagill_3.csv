Antz," What an introduction to Woody Allan!
","I got this film out for the kids and ended up sitting through it and watching it on my own after they had finished with it!Excellent film, and what an intro to Woody Allen.The animation is terrific, you forget you're watching a 'cartoon' and the characterisation is spot on.Sly Stallone really must have some sense of humour to hae taken on the part of Weaver, and I didn't realise that the Princess was voiced by Sharon Stone till I checked on here.",9,0,0,4 December 1999
Blade," Ripping yarn, Spike Lee meets Jacky Chan in Hammer Horror?
","Terrific film, imaginative story line (well, sort of Buffy the Vamoire Slayer meets Rosemary's other baby?) great visuals.The really jerky jumpy sequences, odd angles, brilliant soundtrack, an overdose of special effects and some odd sequences make for an enjoyable evening, and I'm waiting for Blade 2, subtle telegraphing of another film in the closing scenes.Was it me or did anyone else expect the Ghostbusters to storm in at the end, in the odd tower that no-one seemed to have noticed on the skyline?And was the uber-vampire / Frost supposed to turn into a giant heamorhoid?",7,0,1,4 December 1999
Meet Joe Black," Death has a holiday romance
","This really is a feel good movie, well, right up until the compulsory happy ending where the guy from the coffee shop... no, I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it yet. And if you haven't seen it, go, now, get a copy and prepare yourself for a big blub! I really felt sorry for Death, poor soul just wanted to see what it was all about.  Well, he found out alright.No cheesy special effects, absolutely marvellous scene outside the coffee shop.Oh,I'm away to watch it again!",9,2,3,10 December 1999
