The King's Speech," a true classic. Oscar worthy no doubt
",this is one of the best movies of the year. its to bad its not in all theaters only some. anyway this is a movie about the duke of york George (colin firth) later on in the movie to become king has a problem speaking publicly. he and his wife (helen bohman carter) says to Lionel his speech teacher (Geoffrey rush) says they need to help him cause they've seen everyone else. i like in there first meeting that Lionel isn't treating him like royal. because George doesn't want to do this in the first place. but he comes to his senses and thats were the fun begins. i liked the scene he tells Lionel that the people hes seen says smoking helps people speak better. Lionel responds there stupid. George gos to the defense and says they've been knighted. Lionel replies makes it official then. funny and clever. anyway i like that Lionel makes the soon to be king follow his rules and pushes him to help him even if George doesn't realize it. he decides to get personal and soon the king and Lionel have a friendship which i like. Lionel's methods worked and helped the king a lot. there is great acting a great cast and Oscar winning performances. i hope Geoffrey rush wins the Oscar for best supporting actor because he was my favorite in the film. a brilliant film. see it most defidently.,10,0,1,1 January 2011
The Avengers," if we cant save the world, we will avenge it
","the movie we've all been waiting for. the movie we never thought we would. no doubt I'm talking about the avengers. it stars Robert Downey Jr. as iron man, Chris Evans as captain America, Chris hemsworth as Thor, mark ruffalo as hulk and now the highest box office actor ever Samuel l Jackson as nick fury. the story is about Thor's half brother Loki who is trying of course to take over the world. the story is flaud but then counter on it well because they talk more about the stories of the superheros and the things they must overcome. so its a smart way to counter on such a small story. the characters in the film are developed well. they take there time with the movie, which is why its two and a half hours long. at times it drags out but counters with highly entertaining action and special effects. Robert Downey Jr carries the film well and Samuel l Jackson being the veteran in the movie both give solid performances and care deeply about there characters. mark ruffalo gives us a hulk worth cheering for because of the lacking performances from Eric bana and Edward Norton. worth seeing no doubt currently out in theaters. see it.",8,2,6,7 June 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," finally captain jack is back
","this movie in my opinion is the second best pirates movie in the series. (firt being the curse of the black pearl), but i was worried about this one. there starting all over with the fountain of youth. which they mentioned at the end of the 3rd movie. but will and Elizabeth are gone. Davy Jones is gone, but who is gonna miss him. Tia dalma is gone, pintel and ragetti are gone. the only originals that returned for this is of course johnny depp (jack sparrow, Geoffrey rush (hector barbossa) and the guy that plays Joshua Gibbs. anyway they made this movie work without them. they got new people who did great in there roles and Ian mcshane (blackbeard) really stood out in this film. he made his character as evil as can be. he held his own as Penelope Cruz did as blackbeards daughter. they both did great. now to barbossa. he is no longer a pirate but a privateer working for the crown. as soon as i heard that i immediately thought there had to be an angle here of why he is doing this. barbossa may be selfish at some times but his loyalty is to pirates. and it still was. you find out why he became a privateer in the movie. also barbossa is one of the most popular characters in the movie. the writers wouldn't ruin his character that way. now on to the one and only jack sparrow. in this movie he is quite different for the better. he isn't hiding, not being cowardly, not running away. which he has done before, and don't get me wrong jack sparrow is one of the greatest characters in film history and one on my favorites. without johnny depp jack sparrow wouldn't be as successful and as popular as the character is now. as i was saying jack sparrow is more of the hero in this film. saving people. not being selfish, being brave. and that change is for the better. of course they couldn't make a pirates of the caribbean without action and comedy, and there was plenty of that without a doubt. the story is phenomenal, the actors are phenomenal. this film is the perfect pirates of the caribbean movie. the only thing bad about it was that it ended. this movie feels different from the 2nd and 3rd movie and is different from the 2nd and 3rd. defidently see it.",9,0,0,21 May 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," the greatest sherlock Holmes movie ever. better than the first
","now don't get me wrong sherlock Holmes was a fantastic film. it had you at the edge of your seat the whole time. but this one had you falling out of you seat. the whole film was a joy ride. it picks up right where it leaves off in the first one. black wood is dead and the great detective sherlock Holmes and his trusty companion the good doctor Watson are facing the most challenging villain of all there careers professor James Moriarty. Moriarty in a lot of ways is like sherlock Holmes. he is smart, can defend himself, and tests everyone. Moriarty in this film tested sherlock Holmes like no other. giving him riddles and challenges even Holmes cant solve. in certain scenes Holmes and Moriarty are no farther than five feet away from each other which gives you more goosebumps for the ending and who will win and who will loose. the movie brings back Robert Downey Jr, Jude law, and Rachel McAdams. this time Rachel McAdams has a smaller role, but still shes great. Robert Downey Jr brings in the solid performance just like the previous sherlock Holmes maybe even a better performance because of the chemistry he has with Moriarty. Jared Harris plays Moriarty a much more worthy villain for sherlock Holmes than mark Strong's black wood because Moriarty is smarter and is not a fake. Jude law has a much bigger part in this film because his personal life is in far more danger than the last film and then becomes a more important ally than before. this also has more comedy in this film. very funny movie, but the comedy is not overbearing, its put in at the right moments. there is also a lot of drama in the film and Jared Harris shines in the film but smartly doesn't steal Robert Downey Jr's performance. which is good for me. this film gives you more challenging puzzles to solve fantastic action sequences, great acting, smartly written screenplay, and smart directing by guy Ritchie who directed the first sherlock Holmes. this movie is currently out in theaters. it came out yesterday December 16 along with Alvin and the chipmunks. but Sherlock Holmes is worth seeing and will diffidently win the box office draw. see it.",10,2,12,17 December 2011
Iron Man 2," better than the first
",this is one of the greatest superhero films ever made. one of those reasons is Robert Downey Jr. he has been on a role since the first iron man with Sherlock Holmes and Due Date. this Iron Man movie had a lot more comedy and more action. this one in my opinion was not as boring as the first. also this sequel had Mickey Rourke which was in every way better than Jeff Bridges.rourke is the bad guy with a great Russian accent. also it has the gorgeous Scarlett Johnson and a funny Jon Farvea who also has been the director of both films. this movie is defidently worth seeing and getting on DVD. give this one a chance. some sequels to mives aren't a good idea but this one was. no doubt. hope you enjoy it.,10,4,6,9 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," what happened
","don't get me wrong this was a good movie but i expected much more than what i saw. it was funny i laughed out of my seat the whole film, but it got very boring at a lot of parts. in fact the only good things about this film were the comedy, the special effect and johnny depp. thank god for johnny depp because he was the one with all the comedy. it wasn't in your face comedy either. it wasn't like they told jokes. it was more like his painfulness and the reaction he gave to certain things were funny. also davy jones. horrible acting by bill nighly. the character was a good bad guy but the acting for that character was stupid. also orlando bloom was in it more than johnny depp. how dare they. but this movie was good and i have to give credit for that. i recommend it. but do not expect much.",6,1,2,4 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," go johnny go johnny is good
","amazing. finally a good pirates movie. they had just the right story, just the right actors and the right movie. johnny depp showed great acting and made this character one of the greatest characters ever created. geoffery rush matched great with johnny. did great as barbossa and both johnny and geoffery should have been nominated for Oscars and johnny should of won the Oscar for his role. what was also cool was how this movie could be funny and serious. not many movies like this one can pull that off. also orlando bloom and keira knightley had great chemistry and fit perfectly in the film. this will go down as one of if not the greatest pirate movies ever made. congrats to everyone that made this movie and thankyou for making this movie.",10,0,2,4 December 2010
Ted," no masterpiece, but no catastrophe either
","this movie surprised me and exceeded my expectations. this movie is directed, written, produced, and co starred by Seth macfarlane. and while family guy may have been new and fresh and creative at one time, it certainly hasn't been as good today. so i figured since this movie was about a bear and a 35 year old man (mark whalberg) hanging out there would be random cut away scenes, characters that you see in family guy played in here, stereotypical characters, and i figured this movie would be taken way too seriously. but no there's only like two cut away scenes, the characters are actually in some ways relatable and it didn't take itself to seriously. it knew there story was stupid, and ludicrous and i wont say they treated it like one, but they knew what to put in and what not to put in. i was also surprised of how funny it was. there were some of the usual jokes to pop culture and a few other things they make fun of in family guy, but they put a twist on it and made it hilarious. mark whalberg, mila kunis, and Seth macfarlance were all great in there roles. Patrick warburton (joe in family guy) has a bit part. Ryan Reynolds made a surprise appearance. and flash Gordon. the real flash Gordon was in this film. it was a raunchy comedy that was filled with laughs all the way through. it through in some annoying cliques and the whole kidnapping thing was unnecessary. some of the jokes, were a little to over the top or felt forced in, but again its a comedy just for teens and adults and they treat it like one with no limitations like they have with family guy on fox. it was funny, fun, and an enjoyable movie. currently out in theaters. see it.",7,0,1,13 July 2012
Just Go with It," defidently go with it
","even though these people come up with the most unbelievable stories that no one would believe this is actually a a good movie. the story could of ended 5 minutes after the story begun, they saved with comedy. this movie was hilarious and brought back some of the old Adam sandler from the 90s. what i don't like in this movie and in almost all Adam sandler movies there is a cheesy sad moment were Adam sandler looks at what he lost about something and has an epiphany. it gets old after a while. i wish he could start doing his movies without those moments. Jennifer aniston surprisingly payed her part very well and fit her part perfectly. it was funny and the reason i keep saying that is because i laughed so hard i almost fell out of my chair a couple times and thats really never happened to me. the movie was predictable but that doesn't really bother you.funny movie, funny script, great acting, phenomenal cast. see it.",9,8,14,20 February 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," much better than the second.
",thankyou crew for finally understanding the write way to do a pirates movie again. do it like you did the first one. for one and this was a very good move they brought back barbossa and teamed him up with jack sparrow. very good combination. i didn't like barbossa as the bad guy better as good guy. again like the first and second it had a great plot and didn't put as much comedy as they did the second one which was a good idea.bill nighly did a lot better as his role as davy jones than he did in the second one and showed a little bit of background on how he became what he is. this movie was basically deception. every character was selling out the other. which was a good thing and very gutsy. they could damage the popularity of the characters but they didn't. you still liked turner and elizabeth and barbassa and of course sparrow. but all the deception was all about the same thing. trying to stop the bad people so it worked out very well. johnny depp of course gave an awesome performance as jack sparrow and still remains one of my favorite characters and always will. and a lot of other people feel the same way as i do as well.,10,0,1,4 December 2010
21 Jump Street," funniest movie of 2012
","21 jump street was a delightful surprise for me, because i had little hope for this film. TV shows being turned into movies are like movies being turned into games. they don't turn out good. but 21 jump street went in the opposite direction, because they where so opposite from the show. they took something serious and turned it into a funny comedy with two of the fastest rising stars Channing Tatum, and Jonah hill. we start out when Schmidt (Jonah hill) and jenko (Channing Tatum) were in high school. jenko was the cool jock and Schmidt was the uncool nerd. jenko also bullied Schmidt. fast forward several years they end up meeting again at the same police academy. again jenko being the dumb one and Schmidt being the smart one. they end up becoming friends and having high hopes after graduating from the police academy with car crashes and all the stuff you see in movies they end up on bike patrol. the bust a drug dealer but the dealer is let go because jenko didn't read him his Miranda rights. leads to a very funny scene. and thats what this movie is funny. hilarious. with strong performances by both Jonah hill, and Channing Tatum. now Channing Tatum has been known as an untalented actor. but i disagree. he is an underrated actor. this film he was very very good. he got a lot of laughs as did Jonah hill. great chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jonah hill. and if you didn't know, johnny depp made a outstanding cameo performance in the film as the character he played from the TV show 21 jump street that he starred in and that made him a star. i knew that before the movie came out, because i am a huge, huge, huge fan of movies, TV shows, and wrestling. i know a lot about movies TV shows, and wrestling. back to the movie, this is a movie not to be missed. currently out in theaters. see it.",10,0,3,23 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," one of the greatest superhero films of all time
","this movie was surprisingly excellent. when i saw the trailer i wasn't to impressed. but when i saw the first five minutes of the movie, i changed my mind. this movie is one of marvels best movies and is getting me more excited to see the avengers which comes out may 3 2012. this movie is basically about how Steve rogers became captain America. it takes place in 1942 about going to war against the notsi and Adolph Hitler. but Hitler is not in the film, instead it is a mutated notsi leader named Johann Schmidt. a crazy maniac saying there is power on this earth that is made from the gods, and he is going to follow in the footsteps of the gods. Steve rogers (chris Evans) is a 98 pound weakling trying to prove himself worthy of joining the army. he feels he has no right not to do what the brave men in war have done. which is fight for there country. finally a German scientist, who switched sides to the Americans gives rogers a chance to join the army and show the physicality isn't everything. there is also colonel chester Phillips played by Oscar winner tommy lee Jones. who did excellent in his role. anyway he stars out judging rogers because of his weight. and tells the Dr Abraham Erskine e who recruited rogers to the army that to be a soldier you need guts. so to prove that Phillips throws a grenade to the team while there doing jumping jacks and everyone scatters. everyone but rogers. rogers runs and lays over the grenade. it doesn't go off, and Phillips says to Abraham 'he's still skinny'. always love watching tommy lee Jones in his movies. especially this one. tommy lee Jones was excellent in this movie. there is also Peggy carter (hayley atwell) who is the love interest in the film. she liked rogers even before he became all muscular. with the help of Howard stark (iron mans father) Abraham makes Steve rogers a super soldier. it was a fun movie to watch and there was a lot of comedy. the funniest scene to me is were rogers, Phillips, and Peggy are in a car after Schmidt and as he's about to jump out of the car Peggy kisses rogers. then rogers looks at Phillips who has a change of heart in rogers and grows to like rogers a lot and as rogers looks at Phillips, Phillips turns to rogers and say 'im not kissing you'. brilliant and funny scene. i strongly suggest you see this film. its a great lead up to the avengers and gets you even more excited to see the film, especially at the end where nick fury shows up. i think we all know what he wants from captain America/Steve rogers. anyway great film, and any superhero fan will enjoy it.",Null,5,17,24 July 2011
Radio," radio is the station for you
","this movie will do a lot of things to you. it will make you laugh, make you cry. teach people not to judge a book by its cover. truly a masterpiece. this movie is about a high school football coach (ed Harris) takes a mentally challenged person named radio (Cuba gooding Jr.) and sort of becomes a father figure to him. a great performance by both actors and i think it was wrong to over look Cuba gooding Jr. and ed Harris for the academy awards. this movie is defidently Oscar worthy. i was flipping channels and i couldn't take my eyes off of it. i think that this being a true story makes it more important to people and more interesting. it was a movie that i thought would never be made but Cuba gooding Jr. gave huge commitment and found this role very important in my opinion. same with ed Harris. defidently next to men of honor and instinct this is Cuba gooding Jr's best performance. see it.",10,0,0,26 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," one of the best potters in the series
","this movie is defidently one of the best potter movies of the series. it was a very well done potter with all that you need in a movie. it had dramatic scenes that were very well done by the three kids. now there grown however in those scenes they really showed that they can act and can act very well. it also was a very funny movie. it had funny moments however some did not quite fit in the movie. the best part of the film was doby came back for this one but would suffer a terrible fait at the end of the movie. also worm tail was in and Lucius malfoy came back but only for two scenes. speaking of which Severus snape. one of the greatest characters in the franchise only got one scene in the whole film. he should of got more. like you heard he became headmaster of hogwarts but they didn't show it. instead they mentioned it on a radio harry Hermione and Ron had on there journey. they should of showed it. also i didn't like that almost all the scenes were just with harry Hermione and Ron. maybe 45 minutes out of the two and a half hour film had other people with harry Hermione and Ron. and some of the scenes with just Ron harry and Hermione dragged on and got boring. they could of filled that with a lot more things. like snape becoming headmaster and the audience finding out about what is going on at hogwarts. who's there, who isn't. other than that a very entertaining film that makes your emotions go crazy. see it.",9,0,4,11 February 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," an improvement, but still not good enough
","first spider man movie. OK second spider man movie. good third spider man movie. bad fourth spider man movie, the reboot the amazing spider man was better then the third, better then the first, but still nothing to get all excited about. to be fair this movie had a lot of hype and the pressure certainly hit a lot of the cast and crew. especially Andrew Garfield. he is really the only person who plays a main character from the other films. the lead role. and if he doesn't do good, the movie fails because it centers around spider man. but Andrew Garfield topped Tobey Maguire performance by a long shot. Tobey Maguire to me in some ways was like the Adam west to spider man. very kid friendly, and hes not intimidating. Andrew Garfield it much darker and can be taken more seriously, mainly because he is surrounded by a darker area and has a better script. i like how they put Gwen Stacy as the love interest because she was the first love interest and i wont say what, but her story ends very dark, which will lead to a even darker sequel with a much more darker villain. the villain curt Connors I've been waiting for in the raimi series. they gave Connors a lot of development but never went anywhere. this one i think they put him in there with you supposed to know who he is from the raimi films. but the actor that played him very well. veteran actors martin sheen and sally field do great in there roles as uncle Ben and aunt may and bring some maturity to the cast. and Stan lee of course makes an appearance. now this movie said it would be closer to the comics. in some respects they were but there was a lot missing and no doubt this spider man could not keep his identity secret. the story is strong but it seems rushed towards the end. they refer to Norman Osbourne a lot in this film, but technically doesn't make one appearance and the reason i said technically is because the clip after the credits were Connors is talking to someone may or may not be Norman. but this movie couldn't live up to the hype and it was a lot of hype and i guess people that like the film can use too much hype as an excuse but if the dark knight rises is good, that has massive hype and if it lives up to the hype that excuse goes out the window. again a movie worth checking out, but not to rush to see. i say see it, but no hurry. see it",6,3,8,3 July 2012
Batman Begins," the perfect batman film
",there have been many batman films. from the dark batman that started Michael Keaton and jack Nicholson to a cheesy disaster batman and robin. i never thought batman would came back to the big screen after that. and if it did i thought it wouldn't be successful. but i was wrong. this was the batman film that we have all been waiting for. this batman film is the one that got it write. no mistakes at all. i was very surprised that Warner bros would back this film after batman and robin happened. but after seeing it i thought who wouldn't want to be apart of this film. Christopher Nolan is a very wise man. this movie had a great cast like Christian bale as the best batman yet. Liam neeson as Ra's Al ghul. Michael Caine as the best Alfred yet. Morgan freeman as Lucius fox. finally Lucius fox is in it. and Gary oldman as Jim Gordon. the cast was spot on and the story was genius. this is the batman to see. i would even see it twice. I've seen it 4 times. and like a hundred on DVD. see it.,10,0,0,30 December 2010
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," best out of the series
","ghost protocol is no doubt the best mission impossible film in the series. tom cruise returns as Ethan hunt this time doing the impossible. the organization is shut down and Ethan and his team is in the dark. in Germany terrorists blew the the krem and Germany is blaming America. America and Germany are set to go to war. to prevent this Ethan and his new team. agent carter (Paula Patton), returning Benji (simon pegg) Brandt (Jeremy renner) who is an analyst for the secretary must find the briefcase that one man has that will set off a missle to destroy America. this is not only an action movie. it has drama and the new characters introduced on Ethan's team are very entertaining and are a match to Ethan in a lot of ways. the action of course terrific. very impressive martial art sequences and chase scenes. also there is a lot of comedy, and its actually pretty funny. tom cruise always brings in good comedy in his pictures to give a lighter side to the film. Paula Patton was a very good addition to the cast. she brought in the beauty and showed women are tough like men. Jeremy renner is also a great addition to the cast. having a background i didn't even see coming. this film is very exciting and a blast to watch. see it.",10,7,11,23 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," one of the greatest movies of 2011
","this movie wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. i thought the whole movie would be war, action much like transformers 2. which was a joke but this movie wasn't. rise of the planet of the apes is about a scientist named will rodman (James Franco) who discovers a cure for Alzheimer's and experimenting the medicine on apes. when there is one ape that they can use to cure Alzheimer, the ape goes crazy. jumps into a meeting will is having to get more money to put his experiment into action and security shoots the ape. now they have to restart and convince the same people to invest in there company even though a ape almost killed them. when he goes back into the apes holding box, they find under the bed a baby chimp. the ape went crazy only to defend her son. will takes him in and his father Charles rodman (john lithgow) loves him immediately by the way will father Charles has Alzheimer's. and the ape is named ceaser and stays there in wills home for 7 years doing more research on ceaser to find the cure. and he does, gives it to his father but then comes back sometime later.

Unknown," I'm doctor martin Harris or am i
",this movie is not just an action movie but something much more better. i like that Liam neeson was chosen for this role. no one else could have done it better. there are may questions to be answered in this film and some are very surprising. this movie is about a man named Dr. martin Harris and his wife Liz going to Germany for a conference. martin gets in a cab because he forgot something at the airport. and a crash happens on a road and the taxi goes into the river. next you know he wakes up 4 days later on thanksgiving and when he sees his wife she says he doesn't know who he is. now he has to find proof that he is himself. thats were it begins. very fun movie to watch and i like that there was more acting involved in this action movie than a usual action movie. Liam neesons performance was phenomenal at best and frank langella even though he was in it for about 7 minutes or so he did great like he always does. everyone fit there role and did there role very well. i just wished there was more hand to hand combat and more action scenes by Liam neeson like taken. but other than that it was a great film. its currently out in theaters. i highly recommend it. see it.,9,1,5,19 February 2011
The Hangover Part II," familiar but funny
","honestly when i was watching this movie, on some occasions i felt i was watching the first one. hangover 2 is once again about 3 friends going on a bachelor party for one of there friends that are about to get married. its the dentist Stu this time. anyway Stuart, Phil, Alan, Doug, and Stu's brother Timmy all party. 3 out of 5 of them wake up at a dirty apartment in bangkok, when there supposed to be in Thailand for the wedding. turns out Doug went home early, but they lost Timmy. now your basically seeing the same movie you saw from the first one. chow is back, and is tangles in with a crooked investor. there is a drug dealing monkey. there are new jokes. but everything else is mostly the same. there are only a couple scenes where its different. for example, you know how Stu married a prostitute, well in this film he hooked up with a prostitute, but only had sex with her. also remember how chow jumped out of a car and on to Phil. this time he jumped out of an ice box on Phil. also in the last movie Doug was captured, and held for insurance. surprise so is Doug. and once they think they've found Timmy from the person that is holding him hostage, its a mistake. they don't have him. wow big surprise. and they find Timmy at a place that i figured out half way through the film. in this one it took me a little while longer to figure it out. but it was still a funny movie. it was very clever comedy. i just wish that the events that took place weren't so much like the events that took place in the first one. still i thought it was funny. there are many moments and jokes in the movie that are smart, funny, and original. especially the post smoking monkey. i recommend to see it. nut don't expect something completely new from the first hangover",6,0,1,30 May 2011
The Dark Knight," the best batman ever
",congratulations to Christopher Nolan and the rest of the crew. you have created the greatest batman film ever. this film is perfect in every way. what i really liked about this film is that they got all the cast back except katie Holmes but who is gonna miss her. she is good looking but not right for Rachel. heath ledger. i wanna talk about him for a little. he was so brilliant. the best joker. jack did good in Tim Burton's but he was more of a clown. this joker you could take serious and he could tell a joke. he defidently deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor. Aaron eckart plays Harvey dent soon two face helps Gordon (gary oldman) and batman (christian bale) to bring down the mafia and then tangles with the joker. that i thought was a very good move to have the mob and the joker and two face in the same movie. plus of course Gordon batman and dent tried to bring down the mob didn't work. the joker and two face (Harvey dent) did. by killing them. joker killed 3 maybe 4 main guys and dent killed 1 main guy. I'm guessing the rest left to different families. what i also liked is that every character had there moment. they weren't just in the background like they were in batman batman returns batman forever and the worst batman of them all batman and robin. they each had there moment and it worked. i liked that cause it just wasn't about batman. which is good. see this movie.,10,1,3,30 December 2010
Puss in Boots," fantastic spin off to a fantastic series called shrek
","puss in boots is a spin off movie to the shrek series where puss in boots character was in the second third and fourth. puss in boots was such a successful and popular character paramount decided to have his own movie. honestly when i heard about this movie i was excited but at the same time i wanted to see a donkey spin off movie. but they couldn't really make a movie with just donkey. hes more of a lay back character that doesn't get involved in many things that involve him and just him. its always been about shrek in the movies. in this movie you learn more about pusses back story, how he came to be what he is and its a very interesting story. anyway the plot is puss is on the run for something he didn't do, and Humpty Dumpty his fraternal brother voiced by hangovers Zach galifinakes, who comes to puss asking him to help him find magic beads which lead to golden eggs up in the sky. salma hayek also comes in to voice kitty, pusses love interest in the movie who also helps Humpty find the magic beads to find the golden eggs. and of course one of the greatest actors of all time Antonio banderas returns to his role as puss in boots. also to my surprise billy bob Thornton came in to voice jack. teaming up with Jill to find golden eggs and who have the magic beads and puss needs to retrieve them. this movie has all the elements for a great film. they got great comedy, great drama, mystery, suspense. its a great film that the whole family can see and the whole family will enjoy. diffidently worth the drive and the money. see it.",Null,2,5,29 October 2011

","Bryan Mills is the new James Bond. this movie taken is about a spy's daughter being kidnapped and he must go to Paris to find her. at first i thought oh no a film in Paris. that means subtitles. but it wasn't. also i thought how could Liam neeson be this kind of character after previous roles hes done like schindlers list. however he pulls if off very well. when i went to watch the film once his daughter was kidnapped a half hour of the movie was gone plus 15 minutes of extra stuff before he went looking for her. i worried that they would rush all the action and don't pay mind to the story. however once again they didn't. i liked this movie because Bryan once to find his daughter so bad he will kill for her. hes different form the other characters that are looking for there daughter like certain limits that they have. but he doesn't. he shot someones wife in the arm to find his daughter. he will kill with no hesitation. this movie has great of everything. great story, great cast, great acting, great location, great screenplay, great action. if you want to see a action film that is perfect in every way and great martial arts fights which by the way Liam neeson did all the martial art scenes himself. no stuntman. see this no doubt. it was really cool of how loyal Liam neeson was to this project. he even went through special forces training for the film so he could do his own fighting scenes. hope to see a sequel. cant wait.",10,1,2,8 February 2011
Avatar," horrible
","i had the lowest expectations for this film and i was right. dear god i literally fell asleep 3 times while watching this movie. its too long. i like James Cameron i do. he has had great movies such as terminator 2, true lies and terminator. this is one of his worst. this was a total waist of money to even put this movie out. and then they put out so many copies of this film like a directors cut, an extended addition, 3D, regular copy,enough. and they want to make a sequel. also the plot was boring predictable, typical, and not right for this film. this should of been nominated for razzie awards, not Oscar awards. the only good thing , the special effect.no avatar 2 please. don't see it.",1,4,7,4 December 2010
Limitless," limited at best
","this movie is without a doubt the worst movie of the year. the movie is about a struggling out of luck writer, who while walking down the street sees his ex brother in law who later on gives him a pill that can access all of his brain. he says its FDA approved. who would believe that. Eddie would. Eddie is the struggling writer. anyway he takes one, then when he needs more he finds his brother in law dead in an apartment. that may give him a hint to stop taking them. but instead steals the last batch that he has in his house and takes them. now in the film you don't find out who made them and how they were made. your some how supposed to ignore that. anyway he becomes a smart stock guy and robert deniros character wants him to work for his company and with him. the storyline is ludicrous and the acting is horrible. the only bright spot is robert deniro. in every movie he does he gives a great performance. even if the movie sucks. this movie including. some how i have no idea how it made it to the top of the box office chart. its a waist of money. don't see it.",1,19,41,27 March 2011
Dark Shadows," Tim Burton cares for visual than story
","Tim Burton's new film dark shadows it based off of cult classic dark shadows which was a soap opera back in the 60s. it only lasted for 5 years but left an impact. so Tim Burton once again teamed with johnny depp to create dark shadows the film. along with familiar faces such as Helena bohman carter who happens to be Tim Burton's girlfriend. explains Alice in wonderland. but we see johnny depp as Barnabas Collins who is taunted by a witch Angelique who kills Barnabas Collins girlfriends back in the 1700s. Angelique places a curse on Barnabas to turn him to a vampire and put him in a casket forever. but in the 1970s construction workers find his casket and release him. he kills the workers, because of the thirst. meanwhile we see Victoria who we see in the beginning and then disappears then is the love interest for Barnabas. still we see Victoria go to Barnabas manor to help and emotionally disaster girl who's name i cant remember. another plot hole there and gone. in fact there are a lot of plot holes that are there and then disappear. such as Barnabas plot hole where they try to reprise the family business, then the love relationship between Victoria and Barnabas, and then the love relationship between Angelique and Barnabas. you notice that the try to squeeze all the plots from the show into one movie then either resolve them in 2 seconds or forget all about them. they rush through them to quickly. Tim Burton cared so much about the special effects then the story. johnny depp seemed to really try to make the film good with his performance and Jackie earl Haley like johnny depp does a great job and seems to care about the film. but this film is OK. its a popcorn movie. kind of like transformers. you can sit back relax and not think about what your watching. wait for the DVD.",5,1,3,20 May 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," a gripping thriller
","this is something else. this character Hannibal fits right in there with Freddy Krueger, Michael myers, and Jason Voorhees. it was a amazing film. there is a lot of suspense and relationships going on in here. the plot is a FBI trainee named Clarice is searching for a killer named buffalo bill. he captured a senators daughter and Clarice goes to an institution of the criminally insane to see Hannibal lector. he is a smart man that might have relations with buffalo bill. Hannibal only gets about 16 minutes of screen time and most of those 16 minutes were with Clarice. during there interviews Clarice tells lector her past her dark past that she has kept secret. this may sound strange but i think that her and Hannibal have some sort of relationship. even though Hannibal is gay, they have a sort of connection. and i think Clarice feels secure with lector because Hannibal will listen to her. this is a different film but it was very good and Anthony Hopkins who played Hannibal defidently deserved the Oscar he got for that film. so did Jodie foster for her role as Clarice and she got one as well. pertaining to this film. see it",10,0,0,1 January 2011
X-Men: First Class," not first class, but pretty good
","this is a prequel to xmen telling how Charles Xavier became professor x, how Erik became magneto, and how everything came to the way they were in xmen. it was OK. the story is that when Erik was a child during the holocaust, and a general (kevin bacon) who is also a mutant wants Erik to be with him and to use Erik to his advantage. Bacon's character says to control a metal coin and if he doesn't succeed he would shoot his mother. Erik did not succeed and his mother was shot right in front of him by Sebastian shaw (kevin bacon). however Charles is in a totally different situation. he is wealthy and taken care of. but at the same time Erik was a kid Charles was in house sleeping, and he heard a noise. he went downstairs and it was mystique pretending to be his mother. he knew that by reading her mind, and took her in, taking care of her. here we are 22 years later and Erik is looking for shaw. while Charles has just become a professor to discuss there are more mutants out in the world, and is recruited by the CIA to find shaw, because Shawn may start world war 3. Charles saves Erik and thats how there friendship begins. they recruit other mutants and what was really cool was that they went into a bar the two of them to recruit another mutant, and guess who it was. Logan aka wolverine. Hugh Jackman was there playing him. he was in it for maybe a minute., but once the crowd saw his face they clapped and laughed. the scene was Erik and Charles walking into a bar seeing Logan. Charles said how are you. and Logan said go f*** yourself, and that was his scene. everyone laughed. anyway Charles and Erik recruit a team, and while there finding more mutants. the field base where the few mutants are is attacked by shaw and his mutant team. so Charles finds a place to train mutants. which is the school for mutants for the other xmen movies. at the end Erik and Charles goes there separate ways as you might of guessed and Charles opens the school for mutants, while Erik goes to make a team of mutants to start the extinction of the human race. this movie was pretty good. a lot better than i thought it would be. it got off to a slow start and was a little to long, but other than that a great movie, with great action and a great cast. see it.",7,0,4,4 June 2011
RED," RED = really excruciating disrespect to action movies
",this movie was a bad movie. it had horrible acting for one. also this had four stars and it was only about one. it had a horrible plot that could of been solved easily and quickly. how can a legendary actor like Morgan freeman be in this kind of movie. and he died twice. the first time you thought he died with a gun pointed at him and you don't know if he was shot or not. then he re appears in the film and he survived by turning around with a gun and shot the guy that had the gun pointed at him. then dies again this time for real stalling for Bruce Willis character to escape. knowing how smart they are wouldn't you think that he would put some sort of protection to protect him. of course not. the only bright side to this film was john malkovich. he did great in secretariat and in this with him being hilarious. like when they found out who set them all up which was the vice president Robert Stanton he ran at him and secret service screaming with a fake bomb attached to his chest til they got in a limo to safety only to find out Willis was the driver. anyway i do not recommend this movie if you want an action but if you want a comedy trying to be an action film but doesn't succeed with bad acting and a bad story this is the movie for you. if you want a funny Bruce Willis movie see the movie cop out. that was a good movie. as for RED. don't see it.,2,7,16,1 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," save the best for last
","this is no doubt the greatest potter movie ever. the others were phenomenal but this movie had something new. this is also the shortest harry potter movie, 2hrs 10min long. we all wished is could of went on 10 or 15 minutes longer but it was still an excellent movie. this movie is about harry, Ron, and Hermione searching for the remaining horcruxes. Severus snape has taken over hogwarts secretly trying to protect the students from the death eaters while staying undercover as a death eater. and you will find where his true allegiance lies in the film. all the teachers are back also. Remus, mcgonagall, slughorn, flitwick, all of them. and of course harry and voldemort has a duel that is the battle we have all been waiting for. this is a movie we have been waiting ten years to see. it feels like this is the last film also. what i also noticed was Ron and Hermione play a more supporting role in this film than they did in the previous movies. this movie made your emotional go crazy. it made you cry, made you laugh. your on the edge of your seat waiting for what other surprise is coming.i had wished though that the characters that did die, i wish they had shown how they died. the performance that really caught my eye was Alan rickmans performance as Severus snape. he really brings something new to snape that you didn't see in the other films. you see a different side of snape that you haven't seen before. snape being my favorite character, i was very pleased of how his story played out and how he was in the movie. without a doubt see this movie. if your a harry potter fan you will not be disappointed.",Null,0,2,15 July 2011
Fast Five," 5 times better than all the others
","this movie is no doubt the best fast and furious out of the whole series. its also longer out of them all. two hours and ten minutes. which got me worried at first. i thought it would drag on to much. but it didn't. they knew how to make this movie good. in this movie they brought back stars from the previous fast and furious films. and added a new main character. they brought back tyrese Gibson from 2 fast 2 furious, sung kang form fast and furious Tokyo drift, ludicrous from 2 fast 2 furious, gal gadot from fast and furious and of course the originals Vin diesel Paul walker and Jordana Brewster. since Brian went on to Dom's team they need a new cop. thats were Dwayne Johnson comes in. he plays Luke Hobbs, a bounty hunter looking for Dom and his team. Dwayne Johnson's character is completely different from Paul walkers character. Luke Hobbs is buff, tough, sense of humor is somewhat lacking, and can fight. since Vin diesel and Dwayne Johnson are in the same movie, there's got to be a fight. which there was. Hobbs vs. Dom. this is the first time someone is equally matched to Dom. and the fight was amazing. there were the hot babes to. the only thing i don't like is that there was only one race in the movie. they used cars just no for racing. but the race has the stars racing against each other for fun. it has comedy, drama, romance, mystery, suspense, and brings thrills all the way through. no doubt see it",10,6,11,1 May 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," 3rd times the charm
","this is a big big improvement from revenge of the fallen. there is better acting, story, action, romance, everything. this time it is about how Neil Armstrong went to the moon and found sentinel prime. and auto bot who was the leader before optimus prime. that was in 1969. fast forward to 2011 and SAM witwicky (shia labeouf) has graduated college and is in search of a job. has a new girlfriend named Carly (Rosie Huntington- Whiteley) who did better and is a better fit for transformers than Megan fox was. she was better at acting and looked better for SAM in terms of relationship. anyway megatron and star scream went into hiding and is planning to once again take over the world. this time there killing humans or enslaving them to help them rebuild the decepticons planet. in fact they even got some humans working for them the decepticons. so they got a problem. and of course SAM Carly and Simmons (john turturro) find the solution along with the original army that has helped SAM the two other occasions and who work with the auto bots which means the returns of josh duhamel and tyrese Gibson. this film is made like the first one was made. they gave more room for the story, and development of different things, while still putting action sequences in it, but not all crammed into together. there is of course comedy and drama. more drama and shia labeouf really showed more acting skills than he has in the other two transformer movies. better chemistry also between shia labeouf and Rosie Huntington Whiteley. this movie will not be a let down and is diffidently worth the money. i recommend you see it.",10,30,54,29 June 2011
The Fighter," the fighter has a lot of fight
","this was a surprisingly good movie. i had hopes just not high because i heard that it had a lot of mistakes. i thought it had some but not as much as they said there was. Christian bale was excellent. he lost a lot of weight to look more like a coke addict. mark whalberg was OK. but Christian bale looked like he cared more about this project and put more acting into it than mark did. but mark was good. Amy Adams so beautiful in this. she came from ms. saint from doubt to ms. tough girl in this and pulled it off very well. i thought the plot was good because it was a true story so you were more interested in it than you would be if it wasn't a true story. i couldn't believe though how marks character family was so mean to him and only cared about his health because he made money for them. they cared more for Christian bales character. and he doesn't box. he did but then stopped and trained his brother who his mark whalbergs character. and the family says there sorry but who cares. somehow in marks characters good heart he forgives them. i wouldn't. i would try but i couldn't. and if i did i couldn't trust them. anyway it was a good movie and i say, see it.",8,0,0,16 January 2011
