10 Cloverfield Lane," 8.5/10
","With a perfect cast and a tightly written and well-paced script (thanks to Damien Chazelle), '10 Cloverfield Lane' hearkens back to the Hitchcockian thrillers of old, further proving that the mystery box is a marketing tool unlike any other. First-time director Dan Trachtenberg knows what your expectations are, and he uses that knowledge to subvert the genre in new directions. The last 10-15 minutes are the only polarizing moments of the film, but if you go in expecting a typical Bad Robot/J.J. Abrams payoff, then you probably won't be disappointed. I'll only say that it wasn't enough to ruin the movie. All in all, you'll walk away pleasantly surprised and exhilarated.",8,1,2,14 March 2016
Deadpool," 8/10
","Ryan Reynolds and Co. excel in the bloody, foul-mouthed, and fourth wall breaking 'Deadpool': a comic book movie for people who are sick of comic book movies. Even as the opening credits roll, you know you're in for something different. The plot plays out as a typical get revenge/save the girl superhero movie, but the added twist comes from Deadpool himself, who is there the whole time to crack jokes and sneak winks to the audience about how played out and formulaic the plot their following is. Weasel (T. J. Miller) and Colossus (Stefan Kapicic) provide some laughs along the way, but it's Tim Miller's direction and Rhett Reese/Paul Wernick's script that makes the movie whole, not to mention Reynolds' dead-on portrayal of Deadpool that seems like it was ripped straight from the comic's pages.",8,2,12,14 March 2016
