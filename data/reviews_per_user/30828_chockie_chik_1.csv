"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A f a n t a s t i c movie
","This film was so amazing i would be surprised if i have watched it any less than 15 times! The actors were so great - they were so brave to take on such a different role and their performances were so amazing - i have to pinch myself from time to time. 'Being a man one day and a woman the next is not an easy thing to do.' The constant out there jokes (cue Abba turd) get me every time - so do the scenes between Mitzi and Benj - and Bernadette and Bob. I think it's amazing that a movie with such a different storyline and odd jokes could have a soft, sweet side.I recently went to see 'Pricilla Queen of the Desert - The Musical' and i was absolutely blown away - the costumes and the music were so great - i which i could see it again - but the movie was just a bit better, in my opinion - and thats only because the actors in the movie seemed so real - and had real feelings and emotions.The choice of music was great - and kept the lively vibe from the movie going to the very last 'Mamma Mia' scene. The songs are constantly in my head!! The scene after the credits about the kite was very funny and kept me laughing even when the movie was finished.The director, Stephen Elliot, was fantastic. Not only did he write an amazing, open-minded, out there script - but he managed to deliver an even better movie. Nobody acknowledged that the drag scene existed in Australia - and lots of the Aussie population thought that these men were wacky and were making absolute fools of themselves. Stephen Elliot showed the drag queens, transsexuals and gay population in all their glory - kudos.All in all - this is my favourite movie and a classic film and has changed the way that people think forever.",10,5,7,26 December 2007
