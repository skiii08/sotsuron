Requiem for a Dream," Excellent movie! Very emotional.
","I have always heard about requiem for a dream from my friends and i found time to watch it and it was so excellent. The woman that plays Jare Leto's mother did an excellent job. all characters portrayed themselves so well. Wonderfully acted, the movie starts out with the mother of Harry played by Jared wanting to go on a diet to be a contestant on a television show so she does on a grapefruit & egg diet which is not working. She goes to a doctor to get diet pills, which eventually make her addicted.Harry and his friend start drug dealing, he needs it to live. Harry's girlfriend and him live together. They become desperate so Marion (Jared's gf) starts to sell herself for money.Their lives spiral out of control, and it's an emotional thing to watch. It really hits you in the heart, and tells you a thing about drugs and addiction. It makes you think and brings you on an emotional ride the whole movie.Excellent photography and visual elements. Sound effects were 'Realistic' sounding. I can't explain it.I think it is my all time favorite movie. Very well done.",10,5,8,26 September 2007
