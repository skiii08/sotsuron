Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Excellent plot, edge of my seat every second. A must see.
","If anyone had any problems with the first volume, Quentin answers those naysayers with this spectacular conclusion.  David Carradine is especially good, and Gordon Liu is hilarious as the master Pai Mei.  Fight scenes not as extensive or bloody as the first movie, but the plot is more developed, and all questions are answered.  Quentin doesn't fail to use flashbacks and black and white sequences.  This volume is more of a tribute to spaghetti westerns than to samurai films, although there are some references in certain scenes, most particularly 'The tutelage of Pai Mei'.  It doesn't seem to be necessary to have seen the first volume, all though I would definitely recommend it because it is a dazzling film and supplements vol 2 quite well.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
