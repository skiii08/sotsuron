Requiem for a Dream," Just say no, no NO NO NO!
","Ellen Burstyn as the speed freak yenta is the chief reason to see this film. Sold as a horror film, 'Requiem' trades in on Burstyn's role in 'The Exorcist.' Where that film dealt with demonic possession, 'Requiem' deals with addiction; both film have Burstyn suddenly reacting to loud noises and feature venal, diabolical doctors who promise salvation to their victims.
Beyond the anti-drug hype, 'Requiem' is mostly about dreams. Dreams offer visions of hope, happiness and stability but choose the wrong ones, or go about attaining them in the wrong ways and your fate will be just as hellish as the film's characters, the narrative seems to warn.That said and done -- I seriously doubt this movie will make any bound and determined individual from popping pills and sticking a spike into their arm.",Null,0,0,21 January 2001
