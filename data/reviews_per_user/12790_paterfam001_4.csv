Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I'm with the Kazakhis on this one.
","What are you people smoking? This is the most overrated movie since 'Braveheart!' It's hard-hitting satirical revelations: some prosperous Southerners are genteelly racist, a few old cowboys are homophobic, frat-boys are misogynists. Is there something new here? Some subtlety that I'm missing? 'Subtlety,' Mr. Cohen, the word is 'subtlety'. Oh, you don't? It's pronounced 'suttle-tea.' Oh, you still don't... Well, never mind. The intention is obvious - the Man-from-Mars comes to the ruling civilization, and by making naive mistakes and asking innocent questions underlines the hypocrisy and contradictions of that civilization. That's one of the intentions, anyway. The other, I suspect, was to get as much mileage as possible out of anti-PC, out of misogyny and of mocking poor and retarded people, under the guise of satire. Incidentally, when 'Borat' tries to take on a real PC target, it falls flat. The feminists he confronts are not shrill or unreasonable, and they quickly realize that he is bullsh***ing them, and refuse to play along. Unlike the frat-boys, they refuse to be used.",3,8,16,19 November 2006
The Lives of Others," Oscar???
","I was disappointed on seeing this film, and surprised that it won the foreign-language best-film Oscar in competition with 'Pan's Labyrinth', since PL is a far better film, with imaginative depth and visceral feeling quite lacking in the worthy German semi-documentary.The odd thing is that the two have a similar theme, resistance to totalitarian rule -- and both after the fact, since both the East German Communists and Franco's Falange have passed into history. The difference between them is the difference between fact and myth. Fact can be compelling, but surely not so much so, after the fact; myth is always compelling, before the fact or after, and 'Pan's Labyrinth' is myth, folk-tale, Marchen, full of motherhood, blood and mandrake root, grim and beautiful by turns.",7,8,31,13 March 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Sweet, but it isn't Jane!
","To start with, I am a Janeite: I have read Pride and Prejudice at least a half-dozen times, and enjoyed it every time. This may be a disqualification for viewing this movie, because, delightful as it is, it isn't really Jane. I agree with almost all the comments regarding the casting and acting, which have been highly praised. The combination of edgy beauty and intelligence make Kiera Knightly almost the only choice for Elizabeth Bennet, Sutherland and Blethyn as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are superb -- both are actually better than Austen's originals -- Sutherland suggests the weariness, the remoteness, the despair of the father, and Blethyn grounds the vulgar eagerness of the mother in real social and economic hope and despair. The three youngest sisters fill their roles very well, being nearly as insufferable on the screen as they would be in real life. Bingley and Jane are well-portrayed, he as an amiable doofus, she as a sweet, long-suffering girl, yet capable of deep feeling. Mr. Collins is sublime: I am sorry that there was not more of his pervy absurdity. Caroline Bingley is something of a one-note character, but well done. Mr. Darcy, however. The actor does what he can with the role, but he is, I think, wrong for it -- I think anyone who does not look like a young Olivier is wrong for the role. An imposing physical presence ('tall' is not enough) is an absolute requirement. Olivier had it in the 1940 film (its one bright spot). Firth had it in the 1995 TV version. This film doesn't have either actor, and thus falls short. Lacking an obvious reason for his conviction of superiority, he seems to be a mere snob. The worst acting and directing lapse, however, is from a direction you would never suspect. Dame Judy Dench is wrong-wrong-wrong for Lady Catherine de Bourgh. She is too dignified, serious, and intelligent-seeming to play the imperious buffoon, Lady Catherine. Actor-proof part, one would think, but I think Dench missed it, because there is too much cynical wisdom in her glance, where a lighter-weight actor would have made it a gem. The chap playing Wickham - did anyone else notice? - looked exactly like Orlando Bloom. I suppose you've made it when they start casting your clones. The art direction was splendid - and original - in the interiors. The messy, shabby Bennet house, cheek-to-jowl with the cowbarn, frigid Netherfield Park, the crowded assembly-rooms at the Meryton ball, all captured the period, and more important, the sense of social distinction, of the period. Though Lizzie Bennet tells Lady C. 'Mr. Darcy is an English gentleman, my father is an English gentleman; thus far we are equal.' The movie undercuts this to such an extent that the line, famous as it is, is not used. One sees Darcy's point. In the outdoor scenes, the art direction was equally splendid, in a postcardy sort of way. Did Mr. Darcy really have to emerge from the morning mist? But in the end it's the writing that makes the movie, and it's the writing that invalidates this as a definitive 'Pride and Prejudice'. Some choices were just stupid: Lizzie's description of her sister Jane as 'shy' is dead wrong - no one in the period would have used the word that way, and Jane isn't shy anyway, in the sense of 'socially inept'; what she is is modest, placid, even-tempered, good-natured, and, perhaps to compensate for her mother and sisters, not given to trumpeting her affections from the roof-tops. A very short speech to this effect would have worked, perhaps pointing out that men of Mr. Darcy's stripe demand just the qualities in a woman that Jane displays, and to dismiss her as unfeeling when she displays them is deeply unjust. I should point out that when the script and the direction turn to Jane, as in Lizzie's scene with Mr. Bennet after Darcy's proposal, it works perfectly. Is it possible that Miss Austen knew what she was doing all along,",6,6,13,14 November 2005
V for Vendetta," Like masturbation: it's fun, but what's it for?
","I gave this movie a low rating, 4, despite the fact that I quite enjoyed it while it was going on. I would rate it at least a 7 if I hadn't found it, in the end, morally objectionable. In the end it is a nihilist production (very like 'The Matrix', come to think of it) which exists to damp down and defuse all thoughts of current politics and political action in the minds of those who watch it.If the message of the movie had been: 'This is what things may come to if you don't guard Democracy with vigilance,' I might have looked on it more favorably. But the movie's message in fact is, 'We haven't got a prayer unless a super-human hero arises to lead us.' This was the Nazis' message, once, the basis of one of the most grandiose oppressions that the world has ever know.Politics day-to-day is kind of a dull business. Like the laying of sewer-pipes, it is necessary, but unglamorous. You could certainly make a good movie about it, but its box-office would be small. The only way the media seem to be able to deal with it is by way of farce ('Spin City' and 'Where's my Bush') where the main point is, our leaders are idiots. But the dullness of politics is discouragement enough: please don't make movies that discourage us further, in the name of entertainment. Are you listening, Brothers Wachewski? At least the farce points out a current problem with a current solution: if our leaders are idiots, let's vote them out. If all available candidates are idiots, or worse, let's go deeper into politics and campaign for good men and women. A hero saving the people of the future from their oppressors is very much like a porn-film. It's politics without action, like porn is sex without love or relation. Both are masturbation.",4,2,7,7 April 2006
