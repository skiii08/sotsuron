The Blair Witch Project," Don't bother!
","OK, so maybe I didn't see it in the right circumstances (at a party in a room full of drunk blokes on a 17' monitor from a dodgy cd-rom copy), but it no way lived up to the hype. If you want to see a film with poor acting, no drama and no thrills at all, then see this one. If you want to be entertained, then don't!",1,0,1,28 October 1999
