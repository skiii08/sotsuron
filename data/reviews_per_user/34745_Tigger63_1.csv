Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great!!! - as good as IV
","A movie on a par with the original -well done Lucas!  I was leery of the pre-release hype, of the dire last minute warnings, and the over-anticipation - it was for nothing!  Lucas has done a terrific job dealing with the characters, creating new ones and creating a sense of foreshadowing for what will follow.  Many things are explained, maybe too much, and yet the film seemed over before I sat down.  I think it will generate as much philosophical discussion as New Hope.  Jar Jar Binks wasn't as annoying as I anticipated, but there were times when I couldn't understand him.  His role is one of comic relief, and his presence seems purely superfluous. He could be easily replaced by anything, or cut completely.  Strong point - he seems to be there purely for commercial tie-ins - my kids love him, he's funny, I bought my son a shirt with him on it and he loves it.  He's the Ewoks all over again.Regardless of this, the character of Queen Amidala was amazing.  Natalie Portman was fantastic and the character development was intriguing too.Thanks to my boss for letting us take the morning off to go see it together. We all went to see it 10:15 Wednesday morning.  I can't wait till tomorrow night when I see it with the family.A definite 9.",9,1,1,19 May 1999
