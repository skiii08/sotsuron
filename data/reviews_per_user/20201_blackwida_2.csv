The Ring," Goof
","On watching this for the 20th odd time just realised a small goof. When reporter (Naomi) visits the hotel cabin she explains her niece stayed there. The cabin owner then goes on to say he received several complaints regarding the noise of the tv? How when the cabin is remotely positioned? Doesn't make sense?
On another note a sheer classic on my watch many list.",9,1,1,30 April 2019
The Shining," Dull
","Having never read the book I can only make my review on this film which I am suspecting are two very different beasts.
The couple do not look like a couple nor look like they have a kid. The family are not believable. The mother I wanted to slap constantly throughout the film. On the whole I am wracking my brain to figure out just how this has been rated as one of the most brilliant horrors of all time. I do not even class it as a horror. Not one insy winsy bit frightening. It was far too long and drawn out. Yes the scene where blood flowed from the hotel was spooky but I can honestly see why Mr King did not like this film either. At least I can say I have watched it. Being 51 years of age and just sat through it today fully, the first time I saw half of it, I can now write my review and advise those only to watch it to say they have seen it. Would never ever watch it again.",2,3,8,27 October 2019
