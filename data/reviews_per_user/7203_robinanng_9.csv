Walk the Line," Just saw W.T.L.
","I absolutely loved it. More my dad's music than mine (I was born in 1960-am a rock-n-roller), but tapped my feet the whole way thru. It is funny, I grew up with certain songs of Johnny Cash, and heard about the legend of the 'man in black' for as long as I remember, but this movie adds a whole new dimension to the man, his music. I think it's great maybe a whole new generation might come to enjoy his contributions too.J.Phoenix and R. Witherspoon were phenomenal and made this film a joy to watch. I have not enjoyed any movie so much in a long time. Judging by the applause and the grins on the movie goers faces on the way out-I was not alone in my whole-hearted enthusiasm for the movie.Gonna order me a J.Cash CD!",10,280,368,19 November 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Phenomenal
","I saw Pan's for the second time tonight. I just can't really come up with the correct adjective to describe the way I feel after watching it again, it's just a very special movie. Unique. While I really liked it at my first viewing, I fell in love with it the second.I know as far as a movie experience, what I really loved; the lighting, the atmosphere, the fairy tale, the acting, etc. But the experience of seeing it touched me deeper than that, something about it just connected. Can't explain. It's one of those movies that I will store away for a long time. Its one of those movies, either you get it or you don't.I highly recommend to anyone who is contemplating seeing it, to see it on the big screen, with a good sound system, while it is still out in theaters. The sound effects (those squishy bugs crawling around, the boots creaking as the captain walked), and just the dark magic of the forests looming on the screen so largely, cannot be fully appreciated unless you immerse yourself in the experience.",10,3,7,8 March 2007
Saving Private Ryan," Saw it yet again
","I posted my original comments on this film the day it first hit the American screens. I will never forget the experience of seeing this film. It was 11 a.m. on a beautiful sunny day. Me(at the time a 35 yr woman) and about 25 old men ( I am assuming many WWII vets) sat in that darkened theatre and watched this incredible film. When the lights came back on we all sat stunned and then filed out into the daylight, all of us wiping the tears from our faces, some of the men very emotionally moved and crying in their seats.My dad was a WWII radioman in the Navy, his brother was a ship commander, the other in the National Guard. When pressed, my dad would tell me some stories of his time in service. Seeing this film and the faces of those old guys in the theatre helps me understand why dad never talked too much about it. It was that devastating a film, that devastating a time.I was in another room last night, when I heard the familiar sounds of the landing at Omaha Beach coming from the living room t.v. For about the 30th time I was drawn to watch those intense opening scenes, once again drawn into the action. Just watching that first intense half hour, the bodies washing up in the blood red waves, the look in Tom Hanks eyes, the echoey silence surrounding Barry Pepper as he makes to shoot the first sniper to open Dog 1, well I was again knocked back with emotion. I again was so very impressed at how Spileberg did so much, so well in this film; from the distinctive camera work, to the small details like the drops of blood on the camera lens, to assembling the fine team of actors that brought such life to this film and such feeling for their deaths, to the incredible, adrenalized battle sequences at beginning and end, to the very simple moments throughout and the stories of the men.I just had to write again, so many years later, to say I really admire this film. It is important, not only from the perspective of film appreciation, but also for the genuine and heartfelt way it tells of one of the most important times in American history and the very brave men who sacrificed so much.",10,2,3,11 March 2006
Seabiscuit," Fullfilling on every level
","One of the previous commentators noted that for him/her the movie was 'never gripping or engrossing.' Judging from the reaction of the audience members leaving the theatre I saw it in last night,that opinion is a minority one.It has been a long time since I heard so many outbursts of clapping and cheering in a movie, or such sustained applause at the finale. I can't remember the last time total strangers, mingling outside the restrooms post viewing, got into such excited, animated discussions about the movie they just saw.What made this movie so special for me:The acting was right on. The three lead actors were superb in their roles, as were all the other players in this drama.The racing scenes were incredible. I found myself sitting straight up in my seat, gripping the handles with excitement, each time those jockeys lined up for the races. You could feel the excitement in the audience as if we were all spectators at the real thing.The story was a moving tale of heartache, loss, insurmountable obstacles, bravery, heroism, redemption and hope. It was told in such a way, by such gifted actors, that I was moved again and again throughout the movie with heartfelt emotion.The story as well, takes a part of our American history and intertwines real life with legend, making for a very interesting and engrossing tale.I really loved this movie. I brought two teens, my husband and a friend and they all really loved this movie. This film is a step above the usual fare. I highly recommend it to anyone.",10,0,0,26 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Re-saw, re-read
","Needed to see this film again as I grappled with unsettled thoughts the first time I did. Saw it twice more for a total of three times in a week and loved it more each time. The first time I wrote here I was e-mailed by a Tolkien fan about something I had missed in the books. So, I used that as an excuse to pick up the books and spent Christmas week re-reading, for the fifth time, the trilogy yet again. As it was 20 years since I have read it, it was an incredible journey. So many things I had forgotten. When I finished this morning I wept like a baby, as I did the third time I saw this movie.For all the discrepancies and the ommissions, the movie certainly grasped the essential feeling of the books. It is a powerfully moving experience. The movies and books can be experienced simultaneously and compliment one another.After being re-immersed visually and literally in Tolkien for a solid week, this is my resolution: I want to go back to Middle Earth and begin my life over. I want to live in a castle-keep ruled by a king, with walking trees and elves and beautiful rivers with flowering trees growing on the banks and ballads sung all thru the day.I would gladly trade in my computer for a ticket!Happy New Year.",10,0,0,1 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Film/The book/U can love both
","I have read the LOTR books 4 times, with a few glances back over the years. I daresay I'll read them a few more times before I pass from this earth. I need not say to those who have read and loved those books, how I treasured those novels. They are more than just books. They are stories I have held in my heart long after I put them down.Being a film buff as well, I have waited many years,with great longing and anticipation, for a film to bring the magical words of the trilogy to the screen. In my heart I knew it would be an imposing task, maybe an impossible one.In the past year I have seen what Peter Jackson has made from these books. I believe:1). Mr. Jackson labored mightily, and it was his heartfelt wish that these films be as close to the original idea that the books perfected, that his films grasp the feeling and mood and meaning of the words Tolkien put down. To this desire I believe him to  be true. One can feel and see the labor of love he put into these movies.2. I also believe that these books are so intense and personal to each loyal reader, and no visual art can truly fulfill every person's individual imagining of the magical places, actions and people of Middle Earth. While one person might accept the image of Jackson's Shire to be right on target, another might have thought it less than right. There are bound to be some parts of these movies that disappoint individuals, as each person holds a different picture in their own mind than did Jackson,or Tolkien did or anyone else. This is the unique and best part of these books, the idea that each of us can fill our own minds eye with whatever we envision as magical.Those things being said, I liked both of the movies. Did I think them absolutely perfect to my imaginary idea of MiddleEarth? No. Did I find them close? Yes. Can I respect the effort of the writers, directors and the actors who worked hard to bring these ideas to life? Yes.The Fellowship seemed to follow the book more closely than did the Two Towers. But the first book is an easier mark to hit, as the story is just unfolding. The second book was incredibly detailed with new characters, plots and separate adventures of the main characters. I think to bring the Two Towers book to complete justice, one would have to have 2 movies just to cover it all.Was I a bit disappointed in some of the liberties Jackson took with the story, that Eowyn did not take up the sword and Faramir was an incomplete character, as I had loved him so in the book? Yes, a bit. But the ancient Ents were there on the screen and Viggo M. brought fabulous life to Aragorn. Gollum was an incredible character both visually as well as poignantly humanized and Helm's Deep was dank and dark, the Enemy overwhelmingly many.The dead mrshes were truly frightening and I loved all breathtaking scenery, the mountains and the valleys, the imposing gates of Mordor.There were some disappointments, but overall the effort and the final product far outweigh the negatives. Both movies are cinematically brilliant. To judge them harshly by comparing them to the written word is unfair, as one cannot compare one to the other.The bottom line for me in rating a movie is by the overall effect it has on me, after I leave my seat and get in the truck to go home. I was truly moved by the Two Towers and the Fellowship movies. They are not mere popcorn chomping movies you watch and leave behind in the theatre. They are movies that stayed with me long after I walked away from the screen, impressing me with their strong, umwavering idealization of good and evil, dark and light. The same ideals found in the original written works by Tolkien.I'll go see it again and look to next year for the Finale.",10,0,0,19 December 2002
Million Dollar Baby," Oh boy.
","Left this movie about 2 hours ago. Am still somewhat...numb? I don't know what exactly it is I do feel. I really don't want to dissect it all tonight. I just know I have been very affected by this simple, beautiful film.In the movie, there were a few times I just felt like sobbing; and not only in the last 1/2 hour or at the 'sad' parts. Just some deep feelings these fine actors, with this little story, brought out of some deep place inside me.I stayed away from reviews and talk of this film so I did not know what was going to happen. Boy was I surprised by the ending segment; taken back at first and then wasn't quite sure where we were going in the last scenes. Surely she was going to fight her way back? When I saw what was going to happen, I initially rejected that outcome. Then, after awhile, I understood that this was the place this movie was going to all along, and it became something so much more than what it started out to be.There are some movies that really touch the heart. This was one.Hilary Swank you are incredible.",10,5,9,6 February 2005
Paranormal Activity," Awake
","Rented this movie last night, after hearing how scary it was for last year+. While not a namby pamby, it's only me and the pets here in my fairly secluded house in the woods, so watched it while still day out and for last part, with sound mostly off! I did not find any one part of the movie to particularly frightening, (maybe that darn pic up in the attic), it was more like a mounting dread. And to me, a connoisseur of horror movies since birth, that's the ticket to a good scary flick, the tense unknown. The anything-can-happen-at-any-moment wait-fest.You can keep your bloody saws and slasher demonic killers, I like the unseen ones that quietly go bump in the night.Altho not seemingly affected while watching, went to bed with light on and woke up at 3 a.m. absolutely terrified, waiting to hear that sound, any sound that would confirm the presence of the demon in my room. Sweatily huddled under the covers, t.v. on to mask any noises, for the rest of the nite.",7,0,1,15 August 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," All you have to decide.............
","is what to do with the time given to you...(Gandalf)The crazy week before Christmas and I have spent 7 hours in the theatre ( 2 viewings), not to mention more time coming here, reading people's reactions. I have to drag myself off this computer, and my head out of the ROTK book again!, and get Santa done some time. Just can't seem to let it go......I posted a comment after the first viewing. Unfortunately IMDB put it on the ROTK gaming site. After my second viewing I have different stuff.
Loved it more second time around as my anxiety of what was left in and what was left out (from the books) was over. I relaxed and cried and cheered and adored it.(Spoilers ahead)Humble disagreements: 1. Faramir should have been more fully realized in movie. He was a grand character I missed seeing more of. 2. The scenes of the pirate ships coming in- should have been more dramatic, it was a awesome, tear jerking part in the book. 3. Somehow condense the final endings, but I don't know how, as they are important and were very good. Just choppy or something. 4. Get rid of the few comic lines from Gimli/Legolas. They work in the context of the book, but in the movie, take away from the dramatic impact of most scenes.Those few minor things aside,I loved:1. The Beacon Fires; blew me away. 2. The scene with Faramir and his dad- then following-Pippin singing that melancholy tune as Faramir's army rides to their slaughter. 3. Gandalf and Pippin in the hall talking about death-gave me hope! 4. The rallying cries of Aragorn and Theoden pre-battle. Very powerful and moving. 5. Eowyn and Merry on the horse, the looks of horror and fear on their faces when they view the vast army of orcs before them, and Miranda Otto's dialogue to Merry, 'Have courage for your friends.' Very moving. 5. The Characters; not one performance was less that fabulous, making these movies what they are. Special kudos to Sam in this third part.I adore these books, I loved the movies. I am sad the adventure is over.",10,0,0,22 December 2003
