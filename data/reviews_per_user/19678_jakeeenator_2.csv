The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A movie that everyone must watch!!!
","I don't usually review titles on IMDb, but this must be an exception. I personally have read the book (many times) and I can safely say that this movie is almost exactly like the book. This movie was outstanding; both the casting and acting were very well done. And the chemistry between Charlie and Sam make the movie almost seem real. Its movies like this that prove there is still a glimpse of hope in a time of mindless brain-dead scripts. The story is deep, emotional, and keeps you watching the whole time and not wanting it to end. I am very glad that Stephen Chbosky (author of the book) was able to direct/write this movie because of how accurate and amazing it was. If you have not seen The Perks of Being a Wallflower then you definitely should, soon. I hope it gets the popularity it deserves and wins best film next year at the Oscars.",9,2,4,17 December 2012
127 Hours," Excellent movie
","I went and saw this movie a few days ago not expecting anything remotely good but to tell you the truth Danny Boyle really outdid himself on this one this movie was outstanding. It was incredible how the movie could keep the audiences interest for and hour and a half when the entire move was about mountain climber, Aron Ralston (James Franco) gets his arm wedged by a boulder in the middle of nowhere and the incredible things he does to survive. For a true story that doesn't seem like a good fit for the big screen Danny Boyle did an amazing job taking on something like this. I would recommend this movie to anyone, its definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.",8,0,3,8 January 2011
