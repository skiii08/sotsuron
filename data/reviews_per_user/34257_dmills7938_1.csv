Catch Me If You Can," Catch this one if you can
","I really enjoyed this movie. Spielberg did an excellent job of developing the characters and the casting of DiCaprio, Walken and Hanks in their respective roles brings this true story to life. You are tempted to feel pity for the father played by Walken but you realize that he is a malcontent who finds it difficult to take responsibility for his own actions. DiCaprio is perfect as the charming young con artist and complements Hanks character as the FBI agent as the plot moves from one twist to another. The plot provides a great mix of drama, tragedy, suspense, humor and fantasy. The soundtrack provides many well-placed tunes of that era including the sexy voice of Dusty Springfield singing 'The Look of Love' which in my opinion should have won Oscar for best song in Casino Royale but lost to 'Talk to the Animals' in Dr. Doolittle - go figure.",8,2,3,6 November 2005
