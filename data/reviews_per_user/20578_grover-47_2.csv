Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Superior comedy!
","Hello - now this is a comedy I did not expect. This has to be the funniest movie in 10 years, and it also makes a very strong case for 'unscripted' humor. Sure, Borat's crew knew what was going on, but you just can't predict just how (hilariously) stupefied people will become by the main character's dizzyingly-funny political incorrectness (a horse also falls over). Borat famously came under fire and was sued by some of his unwitting subjects after the movie's release. Many enraged folks, young and old, were shocked by this incredible humor. Me? I just say the lawsuits gave LEGAL proof that this movie is hilarious! All this attention gave 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan' some much-deserved promotion, and left viewers in either the loved it/hated it camp. I say it is the most fantastic comedy in many years. I give it a 9 only because I think there was probably a funnier movie made at some point, I just don't remember what it was right now. Borat pushes all the right buttons and Sasha Baron Cohen proves that this character is a true entertainment breakthrough.",9,1,3,20 April 2008
Juno," Yeah, right
","This is one VERY overrated movie, sorry. The extent of praise and showers of awards it received is mind-boggling. I apologize, but part of being a teenager is not always knowing what to say, not always being able to find the right words. Yet after 5 minutes it was painfully clear that Ellen Page would be playing the hyper-articulate card ala Gilmore Girls for the next 90 minutes. Who the hell talks like this? Perhaps the movie makers intended to highlight the character of Juno as some rarified teen exception-to-the-rule. Didn't buy it for a minute, sorry. Giant bogus hipster namedropping fantasy. Apparently Ellen Page already has another new movie out in which she portrays another precocious, acerbic teen. That means she gets just one more movie to do something else before I write her off completely (3 strikes). So she carefully recites calculated, manipulative dialogue (which I guess deserves one star). But so what? This is no slice-of-life realism, which ostensibly it is trying to be. In fact, it tries so hard that Jason Bateman, Rainn Wilson and Jennifer Garner are all uselessly cast in the shadow of its mass pretense.",2,85,144,17 April 2008
