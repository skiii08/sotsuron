Requiem for a Dream," The highs and lows of a family torn apart by drugs.
","One of the greatest and most original films ever made. The brilliant performances and directing make this movie totally believable and the plot twists and cinematography will leave you speechless. A fine film, worthy of a home in anyone's collection. I was drawn in immediately with this film, it doesn't follow the cookie cutter outline that most films of today feel they have to, it blazes it's own path and the result is a truly unique movie you'll fall in love with again and again. This movie totally changed my rating system for films, and I have a new bar with which to compare all other movies to. I definitely recommend this film, you will love it even if the plot line doesn't interest you, you can appreciate the brilliance of the writers, director, and cast.",10,0,1,20 May 2004
