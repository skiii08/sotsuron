Deepwater Horizon," What a disaster !
","Terrible film. Paunchy Mark Warlberg, who I usually like,I suppose does mimic the main lead in this film,whose name from boredom escapes me. Poor Kurt Russell totally unrecognisable from his former cute glory.....why do these badly aging actors want to go on ? Ego,ego,ego I suppose. We all know the events of the BP disaster, a ecological one ..... the only one mention of the effect of leaking over 100 million tons of oil into the ocean was early in the film when one lone pelican covered in oil was ' thrown ' no doubt by the film crew on to the deck... The rest of the film is explosion after explosion akin to a nuclear bomb going off, the result of which was the deaths of ONLY 11 rig staff, from what you saw you you have expected not one survivor...... As you gathered a terrible film,disgusting in the fact that no mention was made of the devastating effects on our sea, coastline,marine and bird life was ever mentioned..... Unforgivable.",1,25,54,4 October 2016
Southpaw," Same old same old
","After not being a Jake Gygenhall fan at all, seeing Nightcrawler changed my opinion of him and I realise he is a fine actor. However this role just seemed to be a vehicle for us to be shown what the results of 2000 sit ups a day can achieve. In my opinion a dated and oft used formulae, pretty boring and WAY too predictable, in fact I was almost shocked at the end it was so corny. Very disappointed at your rating of 8 1, and that was my main reason for seeing it as there seems to be so little of value at the moment - summer hol viewing I suppose. Definitely not a contender, and should have been knocked out in around round 3 metaphorically speaking. Rather stick to Swedish noir on TV for the time being than waste a trip to the cinema on this. Very disappointing",5,3,7,25 July 2015
A Quiet Place," 8.3 !! Your kidding me !!
","Three out of three of us found this film b o r I n g and pretty
poor. A simple premise, alien creatures, looking very familiar ( which film set were they borrowed from ? ) hunt by sound, they cannot be heard if there is background noise I.e a river or waterfall. So why not live by the river and have a normal conversation ? But no ? Repetitive killings ensue. Why I ask myself would anyone get pregnant and produce a screaming baby, when you know certain death awaits you ? Really ? ( bad enough giving birth under normal circumstances ! ) 
Quite honestly, I am appalled at the low quality of films of late that are given good write ups by all the media. O
Another wasted evening, not to talk about the money, mercifully not too long ! 
Sticking to Sky Atlantic & Netflix for the time being.",1,296,579,9 April 2018
