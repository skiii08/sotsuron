Alien 3," Decent Horror Movie Pales in Comparison to Predecessors
","Alien 3 is the 3rd entry to the extremely popular and successful Alien series featuring Sigourney Weaver as the protagonist. Aside from other factors, Weaver made this series with her version of a tough as nails female dramatic hero in military based settings. Of course it helps that the Alien itself is very unique and interesting. Plus the setting, plot and execution are both novel and unique with very memorable touches. Alien 3 however will likely disappoint. No matter how much it differs from the series and what they were trying to accomplish, the movie doesn't pace and doesn't execute when it matters.This edition does a few things well. It creates the mood well, mixing an abandoned factory and jail with an Alien is a good touch. They set up plenty of expendable characters. They give you a lot of extra themes and story lines secondary to the movie. And again, the biggest redeeming factor of this movie is Sigourney Weaver's acting job. She is on point and does a top notch job.The problem with this movie is out of it's control. No movie could follow Aliens. I mean not only did it increase the scope but it executed on every level. But this movie was a little slow and boring. Add in the fact that a slow start has a less than average pay off for the genre and you're not adding much to the core of the movie. The story on it's own seems forced and irrelevant. It almost just seems like an extension of what was postulated in the 2nd movie.I would still recommend this movie to any Alien fans and horror enthusiasts. But be prepared that if you watch this movie after Aliens, you will be thoroughly disappointed.",5,0,5,23 April 2012
The Hunger Games," Entertaining and Excellent but Will Be Overjudged
","The Hunger Games is actually the first movie that I've viewed after reading the book. As such I had mixed feelings going in, and my worry mainly pertained to event accuracy. I understand the nuances of making a movie and had I have donned the Directors cap I would've had to change parts to make it an acceptable movie for all crowds. However, this team executed the movie with a general focus on fact accuracy and the first hand experience.The acting in this movie is great. The actors all reacted in the manor i envisioned while reading. The production quality is top notch, which was expected for such a high profile movie. The level of accuracy that this movie has in paralleling the book is astounding from an adaptation stand point. It can be very difficult to make an entertaining movie that closely follows the structure of a book, but they were able to.I'd like to start out by saying that this is a great movie, but being that I read the book, I had some criticisms. The biggest one in the execution of subtleties. This movie tried very hard to define the dystopian world and spent a lot of the movie's 'free' time on that. However, the visuals are enough that i felt this time may have been better spent expanding on the other characters in the movie. Emotions also took a back seat. Katniss is portrayed as a very strong emotional character, but a lot of the emotions around the various events felt rushed and lost. I would easily recommend this movie to everyone. However I don't think it will be as highly rated as it is successful. If anything I would recommend reading the book. Because I think if you wanted to make this movie you have it stray a little further and create its own identity. Trying to capture everything the book offered in just over 2 hours is an impossible task.",7,1,6,26 March 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A very interesting and rewarding film
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a hit that fired on all cylinders. It has deep and interesting characters and a great, thorough story. The movie is very mature and can not be watched lightly, it requires full attention and will shake you will disturbia at time. However, this all attributes to the mood which is set beautifully with imagery and a great musical score. I think that Daniel Craig did a great job in a more vulnerable and educated role and Rooney Mara does a great job making us marvel and fear her character. All of the secondary characters in the movie add to an extremely complete and thought out executed movie. Overall, it is a mature movie that should be enjoyed by all, of the sufficient age.",8,5,12,3 January 2012
The Hangover Part II," A boring rerun which should be avoided by all except Die Hards
","I have to admit that I was not at all excited to see this movie. As much as I enjoyed the original, I felt very 'full' at the end. By that I mean, I had just about grown sick of Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms and the genre of tenuous comedy they were going for. Then hearing feedback that it was much of the same didn't make me excited. The result after viewing the film is much as I predicted; This was a movie that lived off of the fame the first movie offered. It's like a classic car, it was fixed up to run like the original. However, the result is underwhelming. I was actually bored for most of the movie, and it actually made me question what I enjoyed about the first. Overall, unless you were one of those people who quoted the original endlessly, or are really pumped to see this sequel, avoid it.",3,0,1,3 January 2012
Prometheus," Great Movie That Leaves Too Much for the Sequel
","Prometheus is the long awaited return of Ridley Scott to the Sci-Fi Horror genre. This movie had a big budget and put it to good use. The acting is great for a strategically chosen cast. The CGI and production value of this movie are thru the roof. However, the story lacked the suspense and big moments to make this movie legendary. The biggest issue was the amount of information left for the sequel(s).The CGI, camera work and action scenes were all very well done. This movie played like there was a lot of thought put into the fine details. I particularly liked the degree of creativity with the foreign structures and creatures within. The acting was very impressive and Michael Fassbender was fantastic. Everyone else played their role well, and I felt that Noomi Rapace created a great protagonist. She was delicate yet resilient when it mattered.Surprisingly the flaws of the movie were in the story and late execution. Anyone will tell you that there were unanswered questions, but the truth is much more grave. It almost seems like everything in the movie happened unjustified and while it can be clarified in a sequel, it left a lot of wonderment. As much as I love sequels, each movie needs to stand effectively on its own, and I feel this one relies to heavily upon its successor. This affected the suspense that built up so well during the beginning of the movie.I would recommend Prometheus to any Sci-Fi or horror fan. It is worth a watch, though until the sequel(s) come out, I doubt many will consider it a classic. Being that Aliens is one of my favorite movies of all time, it is possible that my expectations are too high. But if you too were a fan of the originals and wonder how they would look in the 21st century, look no farther. The CGI is crisp, the acting is beautiful but the story and marketing effects give it a limp preventing it from its true potential.",7,1,3,12 June 2012
