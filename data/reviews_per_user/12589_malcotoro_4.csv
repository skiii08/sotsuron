The New World," British in the New World, 1604... great historical movie
","Terrence Malick's new historical film is remarkable... in fact it is astounding. There is something about it that strongly appeals to the emotions, and I have recently visited the forests and Cypress Gardens swamplands of the Carolinas so I know what I am talking about... Truly exceptional, there is a scene at the end where one of Powhatan's chiefs played by Wes Studi is in England to report on Englishmen and their god to return with this information to his chief. He walks up the steps to the trees in the gardens of this stately home ( Hampton Court) looking and contemplating this new country, the people and their culture, advanced and different. I had to reach for the Kleenex, wonderful film, equally as good as Malick's Thin Red Line WWII movie. I am happy there are sensitive men like Terrence Malick making finely crafted important movies like this. Qorianka Kilcher in her debut role is worth the price of admission. Christian Bale and Colin Farrell add to the enjoyment. A beautiful, classic memorable film and I give it 10 stars... from Malcolm in Toronto",10,3,7,12 May 2006
The Natural," Barry Levinson master film maker of The Natural, all time great
","I checked Academy Awards for 1984, where is The Natural? Redford, Close, Duvall, Hershey, Wilfred Brimley, the late Richard Farnsworth and Darren McGavin all give award winning performances. Magical yes, but fairytale (?) as some of your reviewers comment, I would say No, there are too many truths and real life situations. Wonderful script, acting, photography, storyline, sensitive music... who would have thought a movie about competitive sport like baseball would have so much interest and human spirit? It is one of my all time favorite movies, it has a lot of hope, especially for veterans with experience, very entertaining. I know you will thank me for recommending this splendid piece of film, and I personally want to thank Mr Barry Levinson for making it, I consider it a great work, a pleasure to view on screen and I want to share this information with your movie viewers",10,1,2,18 March 2006
Empire of the Sun," Subarashii eiga, Spielberg san (Splendid movie)
","This is the reason I go to see the majority of Christian Bale films whatever the subject matter. As a young man who lived in Japan, studied the language, the people, the culture, later returned to the Far East on business trips to Manchuria and Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Osaka, I can only marvel at what Director Spielberg has achieved here with a young actor worthy of Best Performance from a Juvenile Actor 1987. The making of the movie with author J.G.Ballard is also very interesting, with wonderful rapport between Director and a 13 yr old actor Christian Bale. I am waiting for Spielberg to do The Fall of Singapore in 1942, the British guns pointing out to sea expecting a naval attack, whereas the 90,000 Japanese troops cycled down the Malay Peninsula to surround 130,000 British, Australian, Canadian and Indian troops. In the Malayan jungle the tires burst on the bicycles, the Japanese rode on with just the steel rims. This sound to the British indicated the Japanese were travelling with light tanks and the British withdrew. Yamashita wanted a simple yes or no, and Percival surrendered to a smaller force. There is so much more in the history of the Pacific War for Spielberg to cover and uncover. Anway, Empire of the Sun is a great movie, meticulous in its detail and Shanghai crowd scenes, the survival of a boy in a prison camp, sad, heartbreaking, and moving the viewer to tears From Malcolm in Toronto 25th July 2007",10,5,11,25 July 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Wonderful, absolutely fascinating, authentic for the period, very romantic
","After a hard day at the office, I had taken my girlfriend to see the new Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley, and we lined up to see it on the big screen when it first came out several months ago. We both had liked the DVD of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet. I must say I was a firm believer in the Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth version, however yesterday I spent time with director Joe Wright's 2005 Pride and Prejudice film again on DVD at home. The first time I had liked it, but seeing it again in the intimacy of my home, I learned new details and had a new feeling about it, and listened to the director's commentary. This Keira Knightley-Mathew MacFadyen version is excellent, very romantic, there are special moments in the closing sequence with a sunrise, it is a revelation for other directors to note. An extremely sensitive orchestral piece reminiscent of Delius or Ravel closes the credits. The talented direction is from a young man, Joe Wright. He is insightful but how does he have so much experience? The National Trust locations, including Burghley House and Chatsworth in Derbyshire had me totally immersed and enthralled. Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn, Simon Woods and the rest of the cast are excellent. Rosamund Pike playing the other sister is so stunningly beautiful,I could not take my eyes off her. I loved the dancing at the ball, it was so jolly and authentic. English dialogue interests me a great deal, and I like to browse into the making of a film, and that's when I came to the realization that this movie is after all a masterpiece from a young and new director. Long afterward, the romantic memory of it lingers with the viewer. Remarkable and rewarding, 10 stars. I have watched it at least 50 times, never tire of strong performances from Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen This comment is from Malcolm inToronto",10,7,12,10 December 2006
