Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Movie made for children.
","Don't get me wrong.. The special effects are wonderful and several scenes are awesome, but on further reflection after seeing the movie, I get the feeling that George Lucas wrote this movie for children. I'm sure he wishes he could have gotten a G rating for it. The plot is simplistic and the dialogue is vapid at times. There is no depth to the characters where there should be (read Darth Maul, Qui Gon, etc) and enourmously too much time spent on characters that have nothing to do with the film (read Jar Jar Binks). It was a disappointment to the extent that I felt let down. This movie could have been cutting edge Science Fiction and a great lead off for the next 2 movies to come. Instead it's a simple kids movie that is a let down for all the people that grew up with Star Wars are a part of their dreams. George Lucas, please make the next ones better.",4,0,1,20 May 1999
