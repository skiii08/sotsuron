The Devil's Advocate," If you are watching it for the first time you will be blown away....
","I really enjoyed watching this movie. When I started watching it I was expecting anything but this. It looked like a normal Hollywood comedy. But when I watched it till the end I was really amazed. The movie really starts 30 minutes before it's ending. And you just can't keep being surprised by everything that happens there. Of course Al pacino is great. I especially like the part when he talks about the god. Charlize Theron is also very charming. She manages to look like a depressed woman. And makes us feel sorry for her. Maybe it isn't the greatest movie ever, but it is worth seeing. When I first saw it I was blown away. Next time I watched it I didn't find it as good as the last time, but it was still good. I would say it is a must see movie.",8,4,5,26 April 2010
The Dark Knight," boring....
","I really hate reviews where people write about how much they hate some movies. But I found this movie so annoying that I'm really surprised why did people like it. So I'll just try to explain why I didn't like it. 1.This is the most boring movie I have ever seen. I never liked Batman movies, but this is the worst one. I watched it just because my friend told me it was good. But I didn't enjoy it I nearly fell asleep. 2. The movie doesn't have any sense it's stupid. I don't get the idea..It's flat 3. The characters are so annoying. There is no likable character in this movie. All of them are boring. I have to admit that Heath Ledger was great, but there is nothing else I liked in this movie. It's just my opinion maybe I just didn't get something..",1,9,24,26 April 2010
