Saturday Night Fever," I know it's a 70's pop movie but I never thought it's a good story of ethics
","After hearing a few shares of comments from my mother's stories, I might as well find out why this movie was so popular in the 70's.Tony Manero (Travolta) is a guy with little but contented wages from a paint store, a dropout of high school with an elder brother who's a priest, always pointed by his parents to be ridiculed, with a group of friends who plays the fun for living, being envied by girls for his savvy looks and poise, but most of all... he loves dancing, even to the point that he makes practicing perfect. Things became different after meeting a matured girl who tells complicated stories about the intelligent world...an opposing thought for a dropout kid.The movie is full of excellent scores by the BeeGees and some 70's dance fever hits that's famous when you hear this movie title...but what's the best part of it is about Tony Manero's good ethics against a city life obsession. He doesn't cheat much on his things, he even tries to cheer up his brother after giving up priesthood, he tries to control his friends' abusive tendencies, and practices dancing with seriousness. A look of a good ethics for a city kid. I never thought it could be well made for the movie. At least that saves this movie an entertaining piece of video to watch for it...not just for the music grooves.",7,0,1,27 March 2005
Gangs of New York," An excellent concept marred by a somewhat 'too modern' cinematography and star roles
","You know, this is best watched when its a bit outdated and silent enough that no one ever thought it was popular those days, and now i had my couch for it on video.Gangs of New York is a story about a certain history of 18th century New York, along its backdrafts of gangs and peasants, immigration settlements, popularity voting, and the city's involvement with the Civil War. The lead is DeCaprio, a son of a former gang leader waiting vengeance against the man who killed his father: Daniel-Day Lewis in his very remarkable role as Bill the Butcher. Unexpectedly entwining as his colleague, he learns his secrets and mysteries, until Lewis too learns about his kid.I must admit, I was VERY impressed by Day-Lewis' role. Very believable, well acted, but...DeCaprio still can't make up his well-actedness in this role (and even in the Aviator) since Gilbert Grape. He seems to have this...fixed form...that directors wouldn't want to forcedly ruin it. Even better roles were Liam Neeson's small role as DeCaprio's father (a much better acted than his role as Qui-Gon Jinn), Brendan Gleeson as the Irish guide with an iron cane, and John C. Reilly as the former gang member who gave it up to being a local police officer.The concept was very good, even the feel of the activities in its setting...but it's too...colorful...to believe that this is an 18th Century setting. I wish they decreased the camera color tones for this so that I may feel it. Another flaw is the ending. I know U2 made a good expression in his lyrics, but then the ending made this movie seemed oriented to the 'patriotism' and not for either factual or entertainment. But, still, I enjoyed this movie (better that the Aviator).",7,0,2,20 August 2005
Goodfellas," somehow unoriginal
","Well everyone's telling it and I hadn't tried it once, not even in cable. So here's my two cents worth of it.Ray Liotta plays an Italian-Irish boy obsessed with becoming a gangster. While seemingly getting close to a certain 'main man' in the streets, his dreams suddenly became a reality, getting friends with two gangsters, all the money, a wife and kids, even girls, fame and fortune, all that he wanted to be...until things gone haywire.I know Scorcese is a great director, but this movie seemed like a Raging Bull reunion with Pesci and De Niro, not to mention De Niro being worn out as a Mafia/local gangster in his role, and Pesci uncontrollable in his role that I can't seem to understand he began and end up that way. If I was a gangster, I never would had liked that guy to be met in the first place...and how did Liotta get close to him? The cinematography is too much pizazz by the 90's edge that it end up being boring in, like, more than 2 hours of it (the way Scorcese make his movies these days). Too complicated idea that Liotta's role end up seeking witness protection against his 'friends'. The only thing I was impressed is Paul Sorvino's role.I think Scorcese is starting to diminish his quality movie-making and style with this movie, focusing more on popularity of stars and movie length rather than a stylish, good story movie. I had much fun better watching Taxi Driver, King Of Comedy, Last Temptation of Christ, and my favorite, Raging Bull. I'm sorry for the negative criticisms on this famous movie, but that's how I see it in an unbiased way. Although Pileggi initially wrote the novel good, he edited it with boggleness for the movie, which, err, hadn't got better.",5,9,21,20 August 2005
