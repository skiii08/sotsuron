United 93," Boring
","In my opinion, this film is terribly boring, the most part of it the scenes are about the air controllers and their own language, which nobody understands, and the rest of the film is about how the supposed men in the airplane did make it crash in the ground instead of what terrorists wanted. We already knew this story, history in fact, the film didn't give me a new point of view to me.I also noticed that the only mission of women in the film is to cry and to be calmed by a strong and courageous man (of course, they are the heroes of this flight).I don't recommend it at all, and so less if you are not a patriotic American.",1,25,61,16 September 2006
