Come and See," One of the Best Films I've Ever Seen
","Firstly, I seen my share of crappy films. Just to get that out the way. Now, this particular film is like a masterpiece that should be stored and saved for years and years for generations to see. This film steadily kept my attention from beginning to end (even though it wasn't in English). 'Witnessing' Coming and See (and it's a film you are forced to witness from Klimov), serves as a painful reminder though that the reality of war is hell. In the case of Russia, a very cold hell. There is no innocence or sympathy for anyone. All soldiers are equal. In the movie I thought, 'but hes just a young boy!' Without doubt Come and See is one of the most powerful film i have seen so far. Though this film is emotionally draining, there are so many scenes that are like turning the page of a storybook. At the end of the film, the protagonist makes another shift in character (in my opinion) during the regressive montage where he is shooting a picture of Hitler. When he gets to the baby picture and doesn't shoot it shows that the protagonist still has some shred of morality. As a solider you are given orders without question. The first character change was when his parents were killed. I believe the character 'snapped' into reality and consequently losing his innocence and his mind.",10,2,2,27 July 2012
