Walk the Line," Excellent Storytelling, Performances and Story
","While I certainly can understand why Rosanne Cash and her sisters were uncomfortable seeing their mother Vivianne's marriage to their father Johnny meltdown on the big screen, Vivian's only 'failings' seemed to be that she simply wanted security for her family and didn't think a music career with Johnny on the road all the time was the way to achieve this, and she objected to his alcoholism, pill addiction and his flaunting groupies letters. Seems perfectly understandable to me. However; one can't deny that having witnessed their father's alcoholism, addiction and putting their lives very much on the back burner to his desire for performing- and seeing their parents have a physical altercation (if true) must have been a terrible price for these girls to have paid in their childhood! If anything, this movie made Johnny not Vivianne seem the worse parent and spouse. It's a credit to the executive producer John Carter Cash that he was willing to have had his late father depicted this way- even to the extent of ending the movie before his OWN birth and childhood in which,by all accounts, he benefited from having, a much more attentive and present father than his older half-sisters had had in their childhoods. John Carter Cash didn't even have the end titles mention him by name but merely said that six months after the Ontario proposal, Johnny and June Carter were married and two years later had a son!It's not just the vocal range and guitar playing skills that Phoenix did an amazing job with while playing Johnny but also the fact he was able to convey the often desperate nature he had of needing to perform to feel alive and how he considered the other performers and audience audience to be his family that he always loved yet argued with. Excellent idea to bookend the movie with highlights of his innovative Folsom Prison Live performance in which he bonded with the inmates as though he was a long lost brother. Not a false note in Phoenix's performance in relating in that bond!Also,while Johnny rightly gave credit to June and her parents for rallying around him to help him deal with his addictions and put him back on steady ground. One must ask if one reason he accepted their help/intervention was due to him literally worshiping them from childhood onwards? No doubt Vivianne wanted to end these addictions and it's quite likely one or more groupies may have attempted to enact a 'salvation' fantasy by trying to get him quit- but Johnny didn't worship any of these women the way he had June! Not surprising that Johnny would worship June as a boy(named J R) because he was told that the one means he was able to feel alive(his music) was 'nothing' by his father and,on the radio, he could hear on the radio a child close to his age being praised and venerated by ADULTS for the very thing his own father constantly dismissed. And Reese was very believable as someone who'd more than held her own from an early age in what was then unquestionably a male-dominated profession- yet never lost her femininity or compassion. Reese definitely has earned her Best Actress Nomination here for capturing June's intense spirit- yet keeping her human and not letting her be a two-dimensional stereotype. Robert Patrick did an amazing job with a rather unlikable character of Ray Cash- and one can't help but wonder if the movie (and Johnny himself) may have toned down the REAL Ray Cash's hateful and belittling personality- though it must be said that even though Ray finally grudgingly admitted being envious of Johnny for being able to tell a story, he DID seem to be there for his granddaughters when their father wasn't. This movie may not have every picayunish detail of Johnny's life depicted with flawless accuracy but I think it legitimately captured the essence of what made him tick as best as any movie could have.",10,1,2,11 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Megablasts, Robots and A Chewie Cameo Do Not A Good Finale Make
","Boom! Boom! Boom! Blast! Blast! Blast! Repeat a zillion times with lots of robots and spaceships obscuring the audience's view of the main performers seems to have been the formula here! I've followed this series since the original 'Star Wars' (BEFORE, it was Episode Four) and can even remember when it had its original scroll so it's with some sadness that I can't look back on this too well. I mean, one of the highlights of the 'Star Wars' experience at the cinema is having the ENTIRE audience erupt into thunderous applause when the opening trumpets blare right before the scroll. That didn't not happen this time. I was the ONLY one clapping and hardly anyone joined me at the beginning as the story unfolded. Okay, enough's been said by others about the annoying wheezy General Grievous, mushy dialog between Anakin and Padme that would have been considered hackneyed in 1935 ,Anakin's 'staunch principles' being about as resolute as a weather vane's,etc. so allow me to mention something else that wrecks this installment that no amount of sci-fi babble n' spin can explain away. Everything in this film short of the twins' birth seems to transpire in about a week- yet Padme goes from 'not showing' when she shares her news with Anakin (and seems surprised that Obi-Wan can tell she's pregnant) to only having a small lump during her final final scene with Anakin- yet somehow she's able to bear full-term twins what seems mere hours after Obi-Wan rescues her! It would have hurt NOTHING for Lucas to have had the birth take place six to seven months later with Anakin/Darth being in carbo-frozen suspended animation until his armour is ready at the same time his twins are born and Padme dies!Yes, in ROJ, Luke does indeed ask Leia about her 'real' mother and Leia has images of her she could NOT have had from being held aloft at birth for two minutes before the woman's death but even that incongruity pales compared to Padme being able to have her twins somehow grow from first trimester to full-term in UNDER A DAY! I know it's sci-fi but the Amidalas and Skywalkers are HUMAN and it's impossible for human babies to develop THAT quickly in any galaxy via any technology! Oh, and what would it have killed to have had Padme give some attempt at explain WHY she named the twins Luke and Leia?! Names have power (e.g. Darth Vader='dark father' in German)and these twins are supposed to be pivotal to the survival of the galaxy yet Padme just seems to pick the names out of the air randomly as she dies. It would have been cool to have had Obi Wan, Yoda and Padme discuss the meanings and significance while she gave them. Even a trite scene baby name speculating scene (e.g.'If it's a boy we can name him Luke after Bo Duke's cousin but if it's a girl we can name her Leia after your grandmother' )earlier in the movie would have been better than her just randomly picking them with her last breaths!Yoda, Ewan MacGregor and Christopher Lee all shine above the rest of the movie but one has to keep telling oneself about how THIS will complete the cycle. Unfortunately, the Force isn't so much with this movie as the movie is just . ..forced!P.S. There was NO applause whatsoever at my cinema when the closing credits rolled unlike every other installment I've seen. Even I, one of the biggest fans from 1977, couldn't muster myself to do it.",6,2,4,22 May 2005
