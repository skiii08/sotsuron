The Lobster," Tale of Two
","The Lobster is a curious film with shades of the Coen Brothers or Grand Hotel Budapest (the fact that so much is set in a hotel is incidental, or hotels in movies are places to be avoided). Dysfunctional characters drift through, delivering their lines with humorous lack of awareness and emotion, strange rituals are performed to bond the guests, and all the time the clock is ticking - find a partner, become a couple, within 45 days or be turned into an animal of your choice.The first part of the film is amusing, quirky and entertaining. The style is pleasant and interesting, despite some nasty moments. Some of the shots drag a little, but it adds to the curious atmosphere. The dry, deadpan dialogue is perfectly delivered, Colin Farrell as the main protagonist shows he really is a fine actor.Then the film changes. New characters are introduced and the mood becomes much bleaker. No longer is this humorous, the stakes have changed. It is hard to identify with the new characters as we had already invested emotion in the earlier ones. And it gets worse, leading to en ending that is as unclear as it is unpleasant.The Lobster cannot seem to make up its mind what kind of a film it is, is it simply saying that we are all venal and craven in the end? If so, why the humour at the beginning? And if we are capable of love, is it really so shallow as to be broken by people saying things?I loved the beginning, I didn't like the end. This was one fish dish that left a bad taste.",6,93,136,13 February 2016
Star Trek," A depressing beginning to another Star Trek series of movies
","Nowadays, Hollywood has to be big FX and heaps of emotion, and this Star Trek delivers in spades. It was always going to be a hard task to introduce the original characters without large chunks of back story, and despite JJ's professed 'It's not foot on the gas, foot on the brake, foot on the gas...' that's exactly what this film is. There are a few stunning scenes, but mostly we endure learning about who the main characters are and how they came to be aboard the Enterprise. And none more ridiculous than James T himself. He is portrayed as delinquent child, womanizing hell-raiser, insubordinate, yet academically gifted. Unbelievable. And never mind the many plot holes. Spock has more story than anyone else, and the main plot devise revolves around him. Unfortunately, it is a pretty lame devise. I expect the future films to be much more action, but this intro movie is mostly dull and I found it hard to care about many of the characters. I saw it on the big screen, but I can see why people download movies.",4,15,29,14 May 2009
Lost in Translation," One of the worst films ever made
","Having lived in Japan for many years (I'm from Ireland) I was looking forward to a Bill Murray comedy about the extraordinary city that is Tokyo and the incomprehensible (to most Westerners) Japanese. Instead, I was subjected to what I can only call racist abuse. If this film had been made in Africa about Africans' behavior, speech, dress and customs, everyone would have been up in arms. Every clich√© about Japan was thrown in. Bill Murray just didn't have to act, and not even Scarlet could redeem the mess. Coppola had to film in the hotel in secret as she wasn't given permission to use the place, and I can see why. It could have been a wonderful film full of insights into the quirky (?) nature of the Japanese as seen by Westerners instead of the hackneyed meaningless dirge. Just because Americans never travel, jet lag becomes a plot piece. Jeez! Jet lag? You have got to be kidding me. For anyone who knows anything about Japan this was an insult.",1,61,115,21 January 2008
Taken," Adrenaline and action in Paris
","After a slightly slow predictable scene-setting intro, Taken takes us on familiar territory, but oh so well done. The hand of Besson is writ large across (he was a writer for the film) showing us Paris as the dynamic backdrop for this movie of retribution. It's hard not compare it with Harrison Ford in Frantic, but Liam Neeson as the hard man is an intensely satisfying experience as he carves a swathe of death through the suburbs. I found myself shaking watching it as the adrenaline kicked in, and he shows that adrenaline rush in many scenes. The acting of all concerned is believable and I never found myself questioning motives or behaviour. The only reason I do not give this ten-out-of-ten is the ease with which he rampages through Paris without substantial police interference, and the rather contrived final ending. Hollywood has to have a little cherry on top of the ice cream. Well worth seeing, whether you are a boy or girl, for a rush of juicy adrenaline.",9,2,4,5 February 2009
Arrival," Sunday evening snoozefest
","I love SF, but I didn't love this. First, it is slow. It is so slow I nearly fell asleep. People were leaving the theatre. Agonisingly long shots of the heroine with quivering lip trying to show fear, instead showing angst and indecision. 'Mood' shots that bore. Repetitive motifs that are simply dull. Second, it tries to be dramatic and fails. Horribly. Overly loud music/sound effects (think Cloverfield without the menace), super-slushy strings for emotional scenes that are not that emotional and I found it difficult to care about, and a score that is just odd, like bad ambient music. Third, the actual story is nothing special. Heroine is called in to save the day, after difficulties, she does. Wow. The 'reveals' are not exceptional, and the whole basic premise of the film, the 'thing that makes it special' is so contrived that no matter what happened or you wanted to happen could be inserted and explained away. It's like a McGuffin. Fourth, the plot has a glaring hole in it, you wonder why 'they' did what they did in tat way. It just doesn't make sense. I liked the idea of the film, but the execution was really poor. Sunday evening with partner on the sofa, under a blanket with a bottle of wine.",6,53,113,10 November 2016
Looper," Looper - surprisingly tedious SF
","I like SF, I like Bruce Willis (5 Monkeys was greatly enjoyed), and I can suspend disbelief for time-travel. So how come Looper was so tedious? (Seriously, I nearly left the cinema). I had been looking forward to this film for months. The whole concept of going back in time to be assassinated, and one day the assassin having to kill himself (they seemed to be all men) is most interesting. What is not interesting is long slow shots of people we are supposed to feel for and be interested in when they are most unenjoyable and cruel, heartless people. I didn't expect The Matrix, I did want some tension, not just people bursting in and shooting. For farmhouse tension see Inglorious Basterds, not the lame Looper. For SF gun-play, The Matrix, not cutaway 'oh-look-at-the dead-bodies' Looper (certificate 15 effect?). Even the characters in The Island were more approachable and easier to feel for. Most of the time, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, holds the Willis smirk - yet in this film, Willis never does! It could have been anyone instead of BW. The bad guys are neither menacing nor effective , mostly canon fodder, and the portrayal of the future (before time-travel) is pretty lame. This film is big on emotion, caring about family, but it just doesn't come across as believable. And, as for the ending, completely unbelievable. It is a 'nice' and 'good' ending, but since the characters are professional murderers it beggars belief. This film was written for Redford and Streep. With tighter editing it could have been so much more.",4,0,2,16 October 2012
Her," Too modern, too weird, too nothing
","I realise that in the near future in which this film is set, things may be different from how they are now. In fact, I hope they are. But to this extent? I even find the basic premise of falling in love with your operating system hard to swallow. Still, I gave the film a try.It's slow. 'Lovingly' shot, with romantic music, it creates a kind of limbo not showing the future (no great sets or CG, mostly tight and dark shots), leading the viewer into a dream-like cocoon. No wonder I started to fall asleep.I'm sure that there are people for whom phone/cyber sex is the intimacy of choice; I find it ridiculous. Of course, and I am not giving anything away here, there is cyber sex in this film. It's not romantic, touching or meaningful; it's sad, pathetic and not a little creepy.Since the OS is incorporeal, we know the two of them are never going to get together, so what could the film be about? Take a wild guess. Yep, got it in one; they both learn something from each other and move on.The film somehow does not realise that you need a body in order to have emotions. This really is a key point. You cannot FEEL without a body! An AI OS simply would not respond/react in the manner portrayed. It's as if your fridge started crying because you weren't eating healthily.I could not empathise with the main character (excellently portrayed by JP) as he spent so much of the film moping. He has friends he refuses to see, he doesn't want to socialise, and likes masturbating to voices.The movie S1mone was far more enjoyable as there was at least a face that was presented with which one could empathise and the computer wasn't self-indulgent.Her is simply slow, unbelievable, and rather pathetic.",4,22,50,10 January 2014
