Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Expect the unexpected.
","I expected that this film would have followed (or more accurately forerun) the traditions of 4, 5 & 6. Unfortunately it threw those latter ethics away (the Force is a viral infection?) for simplistic and plagiaristic scenes. I voted a 4, which would have been a 3 except for the last light-sabre duel. Very disappointing.",4,0,1,29 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A genuine epic
","'Fellowship of the Ring' is a marvellous film. Peter Jackson has taken the Tolkien books to his heart, and has transferred it to film in a way that stays as true as possible to the story, whilst making it accessible to anyone who has never read Lord of the Rings. As a Tolkien fan I can easily forgive him for the changes he must have been forced to make, because he has produced a work that is fascinating, exciting and in some places genuinely frightening. My only frustration is that I will have to wait a year before seeing the next 'episode'.Because of the method of making these films, I feel I can be certain that 'The Two Towers' will be every bit as good as this one.Well done Mr. Jackson, I thank you for your vision.",10,1,1,13 January 2002
