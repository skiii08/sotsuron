50 First Dates," A funny and bittersweet tale
","I saw the Los Angeles premiere and have to say, Adam Sandler has rarely been better. He plays a sweet and personable guy, as opposed to the hot-tempered, mean-spirited guy he usually plays. Don't get me wrong. His character still comes equipped with major cajones and the jokes are fast and deadly to the funny bone, but there is a heart here -- beating with sincerity and showing an alternate side of Mr. Sandler's road-tested persona. Drew Barrymore also gets to have some hilarious fun as well, doing what she's so good at -- looking hot while breaking our hearts. These two definitely still have a chemistry bubbling since 'The Wedding Singer.' Everyone in the movie is terrific. Sean Astin, unbelievable, what a great actor! From Sam to Spam. Even Rob Schnieder is friggin' great.  This movie has it all -- it's a date movie and a guy movie and, with all the cute animals (not to mention lack of vulgarity), it's a movie tweenies can enjoy, too. Go see this. Unless you've ever been bitten by sharks, you will love",Null,0,0,4 February 2004
