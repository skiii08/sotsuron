Blade Runner 2049," The film of the year so far.........
","Blade Runner 2049 is the best film I have seen so far this year. Normally a sequel is dreadful compared to its original brother and with this being the decade for terrible sequels and reboots, like Alien Covenant and Kingsmen 2, 2049 is actually great. This film is Gorgeous in the same way as the original and actually stands apart from the original in such a way as to be a completely different film. It tips its hat to the original Blade Runner but stands on its own two feet. The story is a continuation from the original set 30 years in the future. I will not ruin the plot for you in any way as you need to see this film. I will say that the plot does revolve around the same kind of themes that the original does however it's done in such a refreshing and creative way that it leaves you with a lot of questions. It Revolves around what it means to be human as the last one did but also throws in love, revenge, sacrifice and wraps it all up with stunning performances from all but one member of the cast. Gosling is the main protagonist and does an excellent job of portraying the is-he-isn't-he replicant 'K'. In most of his performances Gosling does give quite a robotic performance with a few choice parts of emotion. This usually is his acting MO but unlike some of his other films, where it doesn't work, the robotic acting he does in this film suits his character. The writing team obviously wrote K well and Gosling listened to them and made the character work. The scenes where he loses it and shows emotional sides are brilliant and really enjoyable. Also the love he shows for Joi in their scenes is really affectionate and believable. I don't usually like him but in this I have to say to was brilliant and really took me into his character and what K is feeling and thinking. Ana De Armas is great as Joi, as with Gosling she is amazingly adept at portraying the complexity of a self-aware AI hologram and you feel a connection to her plight of wanting to be as human as human can be. Robin Wright is great as the LAPD lieutenant as she plays a great supporting character who strangely enough is less human than the replicants are but is genuinely humanÂ….weird.Harrison Ford was the main focus of the films advertising and trailers however if you are looking forward to more Deckard you will be slightly disappointed. He is not in the film for very long and has little impact on the plot for the first 2/3rds of the film. While some people are b*tching about this and giving the film a 1/10 (which is a total di*k move) for not having Deckard be the main guy, I think it is refreshing to not rehash old characters to death. Deckard does advance the plot along and gives K something to hope for but K is the main protagonist and that is, in my opinion, a good thing. Jared Leto was boring as the 'villain' in this film. His acting was terrible all of his dialog was weird and did nothing for me. His speech about angels was completely boring and did nothing to advance the plot and every time he was on screen the pacing felt slowed down. His whole character did not feel interesting and I was so underwhelmed. Luckily he is only in two scenes and his replicant LUV is a great character. She gives us a suspenseful, menacing, emotional antagonist who advances the plot well and is actually more human than her human boss. Like the first film the effects in this are beautiful. The use of CGI adds to the story and is very tasteful. The scene where Joi is trying to make love to K is a brilliant example of CGI adding to the story, honesty it is so good I was astonished at how real it looked. The use of colour is very well done as well. Brilliant cinematography, great use of a golden colour palette, honestly the effects department should be really proud, amazing work. The camera work is very interesting with great sweeping shots of the futuristic LA skyline and the First shot of the eye at the start really gets you interested in what's to come and is a unique way to start a film. I listen very closely to the music in films and I have to say that this is one of the best examples I've seen recently of music adding to a film a making the scenes special. The music in this builds suspense, evokes emotion and adds to the characters and their setting exactly the right way.The use of 'soundless' music is used to great effect, giving you suspenseful scenes without any sound to add to the eerie feeling in the scenes. It is important to use music but sometimes lack of music can be just as important and creative. This film is a perfect example of a great use of music and the sound department did an awesome job.Overall this film the best film I have seen this year and while it does have a few little flaws. The pacing is slow in places, Leto's performance is not great and the nearly 3 hour running time is a hard ask for people with short attention spans. I think over all this film is really good and a testament to sequels being as good as their originals. As I said at the start this film is refreshing and tips its hat slightly to Blade Runner however Blade Runner 2049 is a great film in its own right. I urge you to go see for yourselves.",9,11,23,10 October 2017
It," IT floats.....okay...done that dumb joke, lets review!!
","I do not go out of my way to watch horror films. I scare easily for one thing and I HATE jump scares which all horror movies seem to have. Jump scares are just lazy tools to make a film scary by having a sudden, violent thing happen to a dumb character and just making the music louder to provoke a reaction. Having a monster or character that is actually scary and has menace to him/her is much more enjoyable to watch and infinitely scarier. This film delivers that but still has jump scares in IT.I can sum up IT by saying that IT is just a scary version of the Goonies without pirates, retarded strongmen named sloth and treasure. That is not such a bad thing but I just could not shake this impression and it took me out of the film a little bit, especially whenever the fat kid was involved. I just couldn't help thinking 'sloth love chunk' whenever he was there.Okay I have talked about the bad parts, of which there are few, let's talk about the good. This film has very good pacing for starters. Most films have scenes that are filler and serve no purpose whereas all the scenes in IT help with plot and character development. The editing is good with no shaky cam going on when there are chase scenes which is my pet peeve. What is the point of having shake cam in scary scenes or chase scenes??? But luckily this film doesn't do that and that adds to feeling of dread when pennywise is coming straight for you.The music is very well mixed with the climactic parts being well complemented by music that ups the intensity of the scene and allows the audience to feel the appropriate emotion. As well as score music there is also use of pop music which sets the time of this film (late 1980's) quite well. The plot is like any other horror plot and follows some conventions like a haunted house or things being hidden in basements but these things are a given in horror films. The film surprised me by having most violent happenings take place during the day and sometimes in the open. Because there is another chapter for this movie already being produced it might be that we learn more about Pennywise and what is he and why does he do these things. It was not explained in this first chapter but that is to be expected I suppose. The characters are very well played by the child actors, each giving 100% and looking genuinely scared and not breaking character. Child actors are always a mixed bag; some can be great, some can destroy a movie totally. In this film you can tell that they all cared, yes there are some fake crying scenes by some of the cast and this is not great but I usually don't expect much from child actors so this did not ruin my experience. Not only is the acting good, the character development is good. In the space of this film we see all the kids start to grow up, take on a bigger responsibility and fight their own demons. Beverly Marsh in particular starts off as the social outcast but ends up being a hero of the moment and shows great courage in adversity.With a good plot and some great, scary scenes this film will give me nightmares but like I said I scare easily anyway. This film, for me, is let down by the jump scares which are cheap and the Goonies vibe I got from it. Everything else was pretty good and I would say watch it if you are or aren't a King fan. It is for everyoneexcept people under 15. Because of laws and stuff.",7,1,7,11 September 2017
In Bruges," Hilarious, great plot and great performances all round
","In Bruges is a great comedy film that is peppered with true emotional scenes and great one-liners. I really enjoyed watching this film as it gave me a real laugh and also really made me emotionally invest in all the characters especially Ray and Ken. The way this film made me feel is very much down to the writing which is all the work of Martin McDonagh. It is a shame he doesn't do more films as he knows how to write a great script. I implore you to watch this and then watch Seven Psychopaths as they are both masterclasses on how to write an engaging plot with great character development.The plot then centres around two assassins, Ray and Ken, who go to Bruges after a hit goes wrong. There they take in the sights and await further instructions. All hell breaks when Ken is asked to kill Ray. I will not ruin anything else for you dear reader I will just say that things develop quite well and the pacing is solid. Some of the best scenes in this film are just of Ray and Ken talking to each other and the banter they have. Colin Farrell is excellent in this film and plays Ray really well. There are scenes where he goes from joking with Ken straight into crying about bad things he has done. These scenes show off the talent he has as an actor and really gets you invested in Ray and the tortured soul he is. I always say a mark of a good actor is if he can cry convincingly and Farrell does this really well. Another great performance is Brenden Gleeson who plays Ken really well. His character is as tortured as Ray and it really shows in the performance Gleeson gives. He is more the serious type in this film whereas Ray definitely is the comic relief. That is not to say he has no funny lines, everyone in this film does, but you can tell he is the straight man. Ralph Finnes as Harry is brilliant and his character, being the main antagonist, moves the plot a long at a reasonable pace. He has great lines like the first scene he is in the 'you're an inanimate fu**ing object!!' scene which is to me one of the funniest and best put downs i've seen in a film. It's is delivered so well be Finnes that the scene really gets you invested in his character from the start and you realise that he is a well-meaning bad guy. The actual cinematography of the film is great and gives you a real sense of Bruges as a place and setting. In fact the way it is shot gives the impression that Bruges is not just a place but an actual character in the movies as well. It gives a tone of old European cities so well in fact that I might have a holiday there in the future. In a time when most Hollywood films have a boring tone it is refreshing to see good tone and cinematography. The music in this film is not very prevalent but it really doesn't have to be. What makes this film good is the dialog and look of the film, not the music which is only in the background and not at all the main focus of any scene in the film. The music is only there to enhance certain scenes and that is all we need it to do. The jokes are fu*king hilarious and clever in this film, honestly there are scenes in this film that had me crying with laughter. The American tourist joke with the stairs is genius and a great bit of social commentary on fat annoying American tourists and their stereotypical mannerisms whilst abroad. The best thing is that while these funny scenes and jokes are very entertaining they do not distract from any characters development. The jokes enhance the characters, for example Ray is a funny character with some great comedic lines but it doesn't take away from the fact that he has done wrong in his life and you as the audience feel his repentance at all the bad things he has done. This film is just brilliant and well worth a watch it goes without saying. However the main thing that I found a problem with, and it is a little problem, is the lack of effort the supporting cast gives. The midget was not a very well rounded character and Chloe was not very inspiring as the 'lead female' character. In fact the pregnant woman who owns the hotel was better, acting wise, than her.I think this film is brilliant with a great cast, for the most part, and a great story that is told in a clearly presented way. The plot and characters make it so much more emotional that it becomes more than a comedy film. I can't say enough good words about the script and I really do look forward to 2018s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri which is the next film Martin McDonagh has written. I would advise you to watch any film he has done as you will be entertained.",9,0,0,29 September 2017
John Wick," Don't mess with his dog Theon!!!!!!
","John Wick is a very decent action movie starring Keano Reeves as John Wick who is a highly skilled assassin. He receives a dog in the mail (which is a bit strange, I mean the dog just gets delivered to him by mail) from his dead wife straight after her funeral. Some Russian/American guy called Iosef Tarasov (played by Theon Greyjoy out of Game of Thrones) decided he likes wick's car and steals it then kills the dog..Then the sh*t hits the fan. To start off this movie has a very simple plot with no interesting twists or turns in it at all. The main focus of this movie is to show John Wick killing lots of people with no real mercy shown. This is purely a revenge movie in the simplest form. While the plot is simple this does not make it a bad movie at all. Reeves plays an action hero really well when the character does not have a huge amount of depth to him. The other characters as well are pretty basic and can be boiled down to simple motives for each of them. Wick wants vengeance for his dog which was special to him because it was given to him by his dead wife, Iosef Tarasov is wants to be a gangster because his farther is a gangster and so takes what he wants because he thinks that's what gangsters do to get respect. Iosef's farther (viggo) wants to stay alive and make lots of money like mob bosses always want to do and his son keeps fu**ing it up. I loved the bit where Viggo just found out his son stole John Wick's car and killed his dog. Just that moment of 'you don't understand who you messed with' was very entertaining. I also really enjoyed all of the scenes with the hotel receptionist in as he was so matter of fact when Wick would turn up to the hotel (which is sort of like a safe house for hit men and criminals in the film) all bloody and wounded from killing gangsters. He did not bat an eye and would just asked if he needed assistance.Okay so the action scenes were very well done. Whoever choreographed the fight scene in the club and Wick's house knew what he was doing for sure. While there were lots of talking that did not really progress the plot the action scenes made up for this easily. The camera work was good as I did not see any of that wobbly camera thing you see in all bad action movies. Nothing worse than an action scene where you can't see the action because of excessive camera movement. The drone shots of the New York skyline were interesting to see at night as well.The film is well edited and the pacing is very fast as you would expect from an action film. Does not get bogged down with over-explaining plot point that don't need explaining. The soundtrack was okay in the same way elevator music is okay. It does not bother anyone and you do not notice it too much. Just generic action movie score. Nothing to get excited over. This film is worth checking out for the action scenes which are competent and simple plot points make it an easy watch. The reason for the rating was that this film is just that.simple. Now there is nothing wrong with simple but I like my movies to have a little bit more substance and complexity. Look at Die Hard and you will see what I mean. This film had no Hans Grubber at all. But it was entertaining and that is really the least we can all ask from movies.",7,0,0,2 September 2017
Memento," One of Nolan's best
","Memento is a classic film with a plot that is mysterious, fast paced, intricate and brilliant. I will try to not give too much of this plot away but I will start of by saying what everyone else is saying which is 'GO SEE THIS FILM'. Honestly it is that good.To start we get the main character Leonard, who has short term memory loss, committing the murder of his wife's killer. This scene has beautiful pacing to it perfectly explaining Leonard's condition by using only visual means. He is taking a picture of the dead man at his feet and is shaking the Polaroid picture. As he shakes the picture slowly fades from a clear picture to a blank one. This perfectly explains Lenny's mental condition of not being able to retain memories. It sets the film off perfectly and introduces the audience to Lenny and what he will do to overcome his condition and find his wife's killer.After this the story works backward from the point where Lenny kills to how he got to this moment. The pacing and editing of this film is so unique that you are actually in the same position Lenny is as you do not know what has happened at which points in the story until the story cuts back to show you how Lenny got there in the first place. That sounds like a mindfu*k and it is exactly the way Christopher Nolan wants you to feel. Christopher Nolan is, in my opinion, the greatest director of the 2000's. His camera work is very detailed where it needs to be and you can just tell that he approaches every kind of film with caring and intelligence. Than is not to say that other directors don't but I personally find whatever Nolan puts his talents too succeeds. Dunkirk, The dark knight trilogy, inception, interstellar etc. are all timeless films that give a sense of excitement and enjoyment to me whenever I watch them. Memento's story is great and you can read into so many things with this film but let's now focus on the actors. With all the dialog and misinformation that Lenny receives during the film it would be hard for any actor to go from playing guy who has discovered something to a guy who has no idea where he is. Luckily Guy Pearce is a talented actor and plays this role perfectly, you really believe in his performance and you are completely immersed in this film and the emotional way Pearce portrays Lenny.Carrie-Anne Moss is also great in this as Natalie. She manipulates Lenny for most of the film and does such a great job of switching from one emotion to the next. In one half of the scene she is screaming at Lenny in frustration and the next minute pleading with him to help her. It's just a great performance, nothing more I can say.Joe Pantoliano was okay in this film. While he is believable as Teddy (the cop who helps out Lenny) and has some great dialog given to him he just wasn't as good as he could be. Whilst watching I was reminded of the role he played in the Matrix and that did at times take me out of the narrative a bit. Don't get me wrong he is a great actor and plays Teddy competently however I thought that the real performances were Moss and Pearce.The music in this film is very generic however it is used to great effect to emote the scene we are watching. As I have always said, there is nothing wrong with generic score music so long as it is used correctly. The music in this film does what it is supposed to, creates atmosphere in the suspenseful parts. Music does not have to be the main focus and it isn't in this film. The main focus is plot and pacing in memento. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have written a great movie here. The actors pulled together and there are great bits of dialog and action. The pacing and editing is gorgeous and flows really well constructing a narrative but backwards. Honestly this is a great film, on of Nolan's best, and I implore you to see it.",9,0,1,17 September 2017
Inglourious Basterds," One of Tarantinos best
","Inglourious Basterds is a great film and well worth the 2 and a half hours that it takes to watch this film. This film is competently edited, shot and directed with nice cinematography and the sets looking very authentic and a decent soundtrack (mostly popular songs with some score music) The real gem is the plot and characters though. Honestly some of the best scenes in the movie are just people talking especially the scenes involving Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa. This is Hands down the best performance he has given. I don't know if that is because Tarantino wrote the part with Waltz in mind or just because Waltz is a great actor (when he is given something to do with a character).Other actors too give colourful performances such as Brad Pitt who plays the brash douche bag LT Raine and Michael Fassbender who plays LT Hicox. They are not as prevalent as Waltz but make for interesting characters none the less. Fassbender brings a great performance to the bar scene effortlessly building suspense and having a great back and forth with the Nazi officer who is trying to reveal that Hicox is a British spy. Fassbender switches between German and English very smoothly which does not take away from the film, in fact it adds an air of authenticity to the scene. It actually is a plot point in that scene as well with the Nazis asking why Hicox has a strange German accent that is not known to them. Something that struck me in this movie is that all the scenes of people talking at a table have a strong overtone of malice about them. For instance the first chapter with Landa and the farmer where Landa sits down drinks a glass of milk and quietly tells the farmer that he will spare his life and the life of his daughters if the farmer tells him where the Jews are hiding. That scene starts off the movie expertly and gives the audience the feel of what it would be like to be in that situation and time. However great this film is though there are always some downsides. These downsides for me does not make this film a 10/10 for me. I think the film itself is a bit too long in my opinion. 2 and a half hours is longer than most films and there are some scenes that really are not integral to the story and serve no purpose being there. For instance the bit where Zoller, Goebbels and his translater are having dinner and it just cuts to a scene where Goebbels is banging the translator. That scene did not need to be in there! We, the audience, do not care that he is screwing his translator as she does not appear in the rest of the film anyway and has no bearing on the plot at all.Daniel Bruhl I really did not like in this film, He was playing Zoller and for me did not gel well with most of the scenes he was in. He came across as childish in some scenes and other scenes he was not believable as a celebrated war hero for the Nazis. Luckily the worst actors in this film, like Bruhl and Mike Myres who plays a British colonel (honestly I'm not joking, shrek plays a colonel!), are only play small parts and do not distract from the movie too much. Overall Inglourious Basterds is a great film, not Tarantino's best but certainly one of his best. If you are thinking of watching it I urge you to do so as Hans Landa's scenes alone are worth seeing. just be in for a long film, poor secondary actors (Bruhl & Myres) and pointless cut scenes involving a translator being screwed by a Nazi film director.",8,1,3,1 September 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Good but not 10/10!!! Really!!! 10/10 is a masterpiece
","HOLD ON! before you click 'unhelpful' let me just say that this movie is great and easily the best in the Thor trilogy however it does have flaws and that is why it is not 10/10. The comedy in this is really great and I like the overall feel of the film, there is a big difference in the plot compared to the other two that makes this film feel much more fresh and enjoyable. However there are pacing problems, some of the actors seem stilted and dull (especially the grand master).The comedy is the foundation of this movie. Whilst The Dark world was a serious mess and the plot was really dark and boring, this movie keeps it very light and playful. Honestly even in the serious scenes there is a slight comedic side that doesn't take away any of the seriousness. Waititi is a great comedic director having done some really great films such as Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do In the Shadows.He has always thrown a bit of New Zealand humor and stupidity into all his films and it really helps to lift the tone and make it a bit lighter which really works well in this film. Honestly I would really recommend his other films as they are all beautifully done. The actors who really stand out in this are Chris Hemsworth who has taken a tone shift with Thor and made him less serious and 'more realistic' as a hero. Tom Hiddleston is great as always. He has not lost his gift of playing Loki well. The Two I really did not like and Jeff Golblum and Cate Blanchett. Goldblum plays a really dull, goofy character which would work well if Jeff Golblum could play anyone else except himself. All of the characters he plays in every movie are the same character and this takes me out of the film a lot of the time. Luckily he is not a main character thank god.Cate Blanchett plays a very boring baddie with no real personality or charisma. She is the 'goddess of DEATH' and keeps on saying through out the movie that she is which doesn't add anything to anything. WE GET IT!!!!! you like death no can you try and have a personality. Her helmet as well is stupid as fu#k (which is just a side note of something I hated). The plot of this movie is stilted with random scenes thrown in but I still enjoyed it the story. When the plot was moving forward and the pacing was actually good then the film got a lot more enjoyable. Unfortunately it was hampered by lots of 'random character' moments. One thing I really did not like is that random characters are in this for no fu$%ing reason!! Doctor Strange is in this for 5 seconds and really does nothing to help that could not have been done by Thor or Loki. It is just a pointless scene that doesn't advance the plot and probably was a studio executive decision so that they can plug more movies.The technical side was interesting but had a little flaw. The CGI was meh with no real use other than to look pretty but that's the problem now. CGI should be used to advance the plot and not really as a 'look at this' device. If you like CG more than plot and character development then good for you I guess.I loved the music in this, it fitted the lighter tone Waititi was going for and worked well. It is a lovely score of 80's synth that fits the space theme and tone and gives a sense of other world wonder. Honestly I hold music in high regard in film and this is one of the better fitting soundtracks that Marvel have done. It's mostly all score as well with only one Rock song being used to great effect in the fight scenes. The colour palet of this movie is more vibrant than the last two films as well. More neon and less dark colours make this film a lot more enjoyable to watch visually speaking. This goes hand in hand with the music and the cinematography to create something which is really good and different from most of Marvels movies. Overall this film is really good and I did enjoy it, however it was in the end another marvel movie with a few small changes and a great jokes. In a world where we have TONS of superhero films I just want one that breaks the mold and does something different from the norm. The last one to do that was Logan and I wish Thor Ragnarok had done more to fight against the Marvel plot conventions.",8,75,140,30 October 2017
Ready Player One," fun and full of 80's references......but that's all.
","Ready Player one is the story of Wade Watts and his adventure in a Virtual Reality world called the Oasis. When the creator of the Oasis dies he leaves behind an Easter egg in the Oasis which, when found, will give complete control of the Oasis over to the lucky finder of the egg. This is a film dripping with nostalgia centered around the 1980's pop culture which did entertain me but left me wanting more. LETS GO!!!The good things... The CGI is very well done (like all Spielberg movies) and the actual basic story was okay and had some interesting morals behind it. The importance of reality being the ultimate and most enjoyable game was one I could get behind and in these times an important one to remember. For the most part I enjoyed the use of music especially given that it was mostly 80s rock and roll which is really in keeping with the style of the film. The use of science fiction inspired scores is very tasteful and keeps things playful and suspenseful where needed. For the most part the actors are great at portraying their characters in the Oasis and the voice work is very well done. The cinematography was on point when it cuts to the real world, you do get the sense of a bleak future where everyone is happier in their VR world because outside of it the earth is a poor, overpopulated slum. The film captures that really well and I think should be praised for its use of practical as it could so easily have used CGI for both the VR world and the real world. Now......The not so good things. The plot is very thin and mainly just a rip off of the goonies or any other treasure finding film. Honestly nothing really original is bought to the table. The characters have very little development and certain things that happen to Wade in the real world are not explained very well. The family turmoil he faces at home is very quickly glossed over and even when tragedy strikes at home Wade bounces back in the very next scene without so much as a tear or glum expression. All of the other characters play mainly to type and have nothing going on in their backstories besides them helping or hindering Wade in finding the Easter Egg. I did say the actors did a good job at playing the characters but my problem is that when their characters are one dimensional and have so little development it's really hard for me to empathize and fell attached to them. Like I said without the references this movie is basically a straight forward film with nothing of merit and no significant character development. Hollywood at the moment is relying too much on pop culture references, memes and nostalgia in its latest films. Ready Player One is a prime example of this! I'm sorry but I just can't give a film a glowing review if its main draw is 'oh look it's a Jurassic Park reference' or 'oh it's that thing I love from ages ago'. In the cinema I was genuinely asking myself why I shouldn't be watching Back to the Future instead of this film. Honestly I think you would have a better time watching any of the films Ready Player One references. Don't get me wrong this film is not a bad one by anyone's standards but it is all sizzling 80s and no plot and character development steak.",6,0,1,24 April 2018
Suicide Squad," Not one bit of quality
","Suicide Squad made me actually angry and violent at my friend for buying this 'film' on DVD and letting me watch it without saying how awful it really was. I had read reviews that said it was bad and gave it 4/10 which is a very misleading score as it suggests some quality things about this movie. Honestly if I could give it 0/10 I would but IMDb only lets you do 1/10 as a valid rating. I have nothing but contempt for this movie as it is poor in every sense of the word!!!Let's start with the plot which is just thrown lazily together as if the people who wrote it were just said 'screw it, let's just focus on getting Harley Quinn in as many sexy uniforms as possible and making loads of money at the box office'. The plot boils down to this government woman, Amanda Waller, putting together a team of super villains to fight other super villains..Sounds like a great idea but when this character explains it 3,4,5 bloody times in the movie it gets a bit wearing and stupid. The team consists of Will Smith (deadshot), Margo Robbie (Harley Quinn) and a load of other characters that are not as flushed out with only three of them being integral to the story. I could go on about characters and plot for 1000 alone but I will just list specifically bad characters that deserve a dishonourable mention.Will Smith plays Will Smith in this movie and is awfulllll at playing a villain of any kind. Will Smith can only play heroes so he just doesn't work as a villain. Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn is just there as a sex symbol and she tries to be the comic relief as well. As a comic relief she is sooooo bad with terrible one liners that do not get any laughs and just leave you with your head in your hands. She is sexy in this film but it is so forced that after a while even teenagers will just go MEH and go back to playing candy crush or take drugs (whatever teenagers do now)Another dishonourable mention goes to the Jared Letto Joker. This is probably the worst joker I have seen on film and the portrayal of him as some kind of kingpin/pimp is very off putting. His relationship with Harley Quinn too is wrong and mismatched. I find it hard for the joker to be in love with Harley as he is supposed to be the living embodiment of chaos and having him act as a love sick puppy trying to get back his girl seems completely wrong to other movies I have seen him in. As an example in the dark knight Nolan and Ledger took care to play and wright the joker as he is supposed to be, an anarchist who cares nothing for no one. They wrote him as someone who wants to 'watch the world burn'. In Suicide Squad he is a pimp and has to say that he is chaos TO THE AUDIENCE instead of showing us he is!!My beef with this 'film' is not just the characters and the stupid plot but also the technical side of things. This movie is so badly edited that it is painful. A few reviews say that this film feels like one big trailer and that is completely down to poor editing. In this movie scenes do not end or begin they just happen and then a next scene comes up and happens and it is just so crap. Because of the editing the pacing suffers as well as this film is slow and fast paced in such an infrequent way that it gave me an aneurysm in my brain. During shooting the trailer house for this movie also edited parts of the film as well so that is probably why the film looks so disjointed. The lighting during the film is terrible as it is just dark and bland with some bits being so dark that the scenes are close to being underexposed. Underexposed is when a film is so poorly lighted that you can't really see what is going on in the film and this 'film' definitely does that.The soundtrack as well is garbage. They just get all of these great songs from different artists like Queen, ACDC and Black Sabbath and just put them randomly in the movie without any context at all. You can't just fling songs at the wall and see what sticks. Music is supposed to complement the film and add atmosphere. This film does not do that. NOT ONE BIT!!!!I know this has been a long review but there are just so many problems with this film that I just have to say how BAD this movie is and i'm still not done. I don't think 1000 word limit is enough to explain how sh** this movie is. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!!",1,2,2,2 September 2017
Doctor Strange," No originality. Style over substance
","Doctor Strange is boring and has some of the worst acting I have seen in a Marvel movie. The best thing about the MCU is that it makes consistently fun films, but Doctor strange just falls completely flat. Don't get me wrong this film is no Suicide Squad but it is such a cookie cutter movie that has bad acting and terrible dialogue by the main character that I found it very hard to enjoy.Let's look at the bad things first and then lead with some good things the film does right. The reason I hated Doctor Strange himself was partly due to the fact that Cumberbatch played him terribly. The US accent he uses when he is playing Strange is inconsistent at best. Honestly it sounds like a guy from Hammersmith doing an American accent. At no point in the film was I sitting there thinking he's not English. It took me out of the film so many times that I dreaded the bits with him in.Stephen Strange is very poorly written in this film. He starts off as an arrogant a**hole and doesn't change at all throughout the film. His demeanour would be fine if he was charismatic or a little funny but all of the jokes he has written for him are painfully unfunny and fall flat. The Beyoncé joke he has with Wong is just BLEH and a classic example of terrible dialogue that is throw into this film. With superhero films you have to make them relatable and at least funny in some scenes. Iron man does this very well as Tony Stark is an a**hole, like Strange, however Stark has charisma and was written with funny lines that made him relatable as a character. Stark is good and tries to put others first which most audience members share and this is how the audience relates. Strange cares for himself and no one else, making him hard to relate too and making him unlikeable. He doesn't change at the end of the film; he just comes to the realisation that it is okay to loose sometimes. He doesn't even stop being a selfish di*k head so there is little character development for our MAIN CHARACTER!Tilda Swinton plays the ancient one. I will not go into whether I think Swinton's character should have been played by an elderly Asian man like in the comics, I will let the SJWs get hard over that one.I personally don't care that much; as I have not read the comics so I'm not that attached to the character. Swinton is okay and does know how to portray a wise woman well I guess. Her character can sometimes be a boring wooden character sometimes but not to the point where it ruins the film. That's all I have to say on her.The plot is a simple cookie cutter plot that Marvel likes to use again and again. Honestly the plots in some marvel films are so samey that you really have to wonder about the originality here. Doctor Strange follows the same conventions of most superhero movies like a big fight at the end with a powerful bad guy, sidekicks turning evil and a treasured mentor dying. While there is nothing wrong with conventions it would be nice for marvel to break this chain and deviate from the norm. The CGI was good in this film. The scene where Strange is first shown the mystic arts and the 'dream sequences' where the worlds are turned upside down are great visually. CGI is great and can really help a story along when a character is explaining the magic used. This film is a good example of that and when Tilda Swinton is explaining these principles to Strange it is at least fun to watch.The other technical parts of the film are barely noticeable. I have no opinion on the music because I wasn't really paying attention to it at all. That is a shame as it shows that it was not used to the effect that music can be used in film. The cinematography, as well, fell short and went practically unnoticed by me. In fact the CGI is the only thing worth note in this film from a technical point of view which is sad. This film is a Marvel 'filler movie' that, on its own, is easily forgettable and does nothing to advance the MCU in any way. Unfortunately the MCU loves to play it safe with these 'filler movies' like Ant man, Incredible Hulk, Iron man 2 and Doctor Strange these movies are just there to keep us interested so everyone will go and see the new Avengers film or another Thor film.This film could be better if they had just made Strange a likable hero instead of an as*hole and Benedict worked on his accent. It is sad but it is true and it is the main reason why this film is bad. The other characters are fine but hardly anything to write home about and the whole movie is a bit on the mediocre side of things. The CGI is good, well done effects team, but it is that classic case of style over substance.",4,0,2,26 September 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The Best Movie Of 2017!!
","I have now watched this film twice and I can honestly say that it is perfect in everyway. Im going to try and explain why this movie is great but my explaining could not really do justice to this film. This film has all the key things a film has to have to be great like a strong engageing plot, strong characters, great camera work, great sound track all of it. I will try and not spoil the plot but it starts with a mothers attempt to stir the police of her town into finding her daughter's killer. From there the film leads a dark path of vengence that is very humorous at times as well as heart breaking. The scrip was written by Martin McDonagh who wrote and directed two of my favourite films. This is his third film and honestly it is his best work. He brings his a game in the direction, story writing and camera direction. Honestly the man, in my opinion, is the best director working at the moment. Not only is the director brilliant with loads of development and twists but the cast is stella and Frances McDormand is THE BEST part of this film. Her portrayal of Mildred is awesome and made me feel for her character and what she goes through. I can say the same for Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell. Sam Rockwell actually has the most character development. He changes from an a**hole into probably the best character. The way he portrays this change in the character is inspired and has cemented him, in my mind, as a fantastic actor. The way Harrelson plays the cheif of police and the masterful way he develops this character and breaths life into the part McDonagh has written is beyond brilliant. Then you have a great supporting cast that adds background colour. I even loved the guy who put up the billboards AND HE WAS IN TWO SCENES!!!!
 
The Two main strenghts of this film are the plot and performances which i can't say enough good things about. However the technical side is masterful with great cinematography, beautiful sweeping shots shots and the scene with Rockwell in the advertisers office is a masterclass in camera work for anyone. It actually looks like it was done in one take however im not sure if it was or not. Again great work and very enjoyable to watch. The use of popular music is very characteristic of McDonagh and is used to great effect in especially the advertiser scene with Rockwell. I loved that iit captured the mood of the characters an their actions so well. Honestly Im running out of different ways to praise this movie.You know that annoying friend who is like 'Dude you NEED to watch this film'. Honestly if he is talking about this one PLEASE for the love of god listen to him it is that good. Hence why it is a 10\10 from me.",10,4,8,19 January 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," The Movember Blockbuster of the year!!
","This is probably one of my favourite films of the year and while far from a perfect movie I do have no major problems with it. Yes there are some things which I will get into but all in all It's good and If you like Queen go see it. OK! There! I've done a short outline for you guys; if you are too impatient to read the rest at least you know my thoughts now go away.I like Queen as any sane person does and I found this movie to be a realistic, although a little overdramatic, portrayal of their ups and downs culminating in their Live Aid performance. The film did not focus on Mercury too much and instead looked at the band as a whole. I thought this was a good choice as many other documentaries about Queen usually focus on Mercury and that's it.
This was clearly a choice that Brian May and Roger Taylor, who produced the film, made to show the band as a collaborative effort. You really get the feeling that all the members of the band were great songwriters in their own way. The film does explore Mercury's sexuality problems and touches on his home life as well which I thought was a little rushed and not in depth as it should be. I think the main focus here is the band relationship and not the individuals.For the most part all the scenes do seem genuine and flow very well in the narrative. There are, however, a few moments brought straight out of shlock Hollywood films and that is something I wasn't too impressed with. For instance there's a scene with Bohemian Rhapsody being made that is a bit corny. This is not a major critique however and isn't a spoiling moment.The performance by Rami Malik as Fred is just wonderful and so realistic at times that I felt completely amerced in the movie. I loved Malik in MR. ROBOT and here he does a stella job bringing a beloved icon to life. The other members of the band were played well by their respective actors. Gwilym Lee was great as Brian May and I did also love the guy who played John Deacon as well.The draw of the movie will be the music and getting to know the stories behind some famous songs by Queen like 'Another one bites the dust' and 'love of my life'. All the songs featured were sung by Malik as well which is very impressive and he himself does a great cover of Mercury.I loved the music in this and thought that It was interesting how some of the time it is integrated into scenes of the bands life whilst other times it is sung onstage by Malik himself. This gives the feeling that the music is the most integral part of the story which, for a film about a band, is essential.As said I have no problems with this film and it is definitely a great watch with an emotional tread of friendship running through the story. I would recommend this film to anyone, you don't have to love Queen to see it......but it helps.",7,2,7,27 October 2018
Justice League," Why do I bother.
",It's what you would expect from a franchise batting one eh movie to three abortions. Don't go and see this film.I know my reviews are normally longer and more in depth but honestly I'm tired of superhero movies. This one is just as generic in all technical ways. The plot is cookie cutter and the actor's try but I was not invested emotionally in any of them. I go to see these so you don't have to....your welcome.,3,11,21,20 November 2017
Split," A return to form
","Shyamalan has made some abortions in film recently such as The Happening and Signs, however Split is a return to what made him a great writer/director in the first place. Split is a competent horror/thriller film which has a decent plot, is well shot and has great actors in it. The story is simple enough to follow with some quite intriguing scenes, like when we are first introduced to the different personalities that Kevin has. Some of the best scenes in the movie are when you see Kevin's different personalities coming to the surface and interacting with each other. For instance it's really interesting to watch Dennis and Patricia work together in the same body. The plot has no twist scenes at the end like a lot of Shyamalan's other work which is a departure from the norm but not so much as it leaves the audience wanting more or confused about anything. As well thought out as the plot is there are some moments that are too formulaic for me personally. For instance Casey is an abused by her uncle and is a 'weird kid' in school that only gets invited to parties out of sympathy. This kind of character has been done so many times that it does not wow me anymore when I'm watching (no matter how 'cute' the child actor playing young Casey is! I just don't give a shi*). Casey's two friends have little character development in the film. They are only in there to get naked and die off screen, which is as deep as their characters go. Nothing more to be said. The woman therapist is at least more interesting than the two victims. She is trying to understand these people with multiple personalities and what they can do but unfortunately gets captured and killed by Kevin or Dennis or Patricia or 'the Beast'. Whichever one. James McAvoy is brilliant in this film and he is what makes this film. The plot helps out but what brings it up a notch is McAvoy's performance. He does a great job of giving depth to all of the multiple personalities he plays and the sense of suspense and violence when he is playing 'the beast' is really well done. In this movie he cries on command too which I always think is the mark of a great actor. If you can't cry on command you are a sh*t actor in my opinion!!There are not too many jump scares in this 'horror/thriller' which is a good thing as jump scares are just cheap ways of scaring the audience and are only in awful horror films ,this film is actually competent and doesn't do that thank god. Instead it has a character that is unpredictable and that is where the fear for this film comes from. Kevin has all of these personalities that are unique with some being safe and some personalities being dangerous and you never know which one is 'in the light'. The sound is competently done with no out of place music and suspenseful score music when there is a suspenseful scene. It did not WOW me in the way that other movies used sound but it wasn't done badly at all. The sound is just competentthat's all. The use of colour in this film is also competent but nothing too shout about. Because it is a thriller the colour of this movie is turned down so even the colourful bits of the movie look darker. I wish they had done something different as this is done in most horror movies and something different would have been nice but oh well can't have anything in life. Overall after the fuc**ng dog sh*t that was The Happening, Avatar, After Earth, The Village, Lady in the Water and Signs it is great to get a decent movie from M. Knight. This film does not break new ground and is formulaic in most parts with character development being quite low. However McAvoy lends his talents to this film. The pacing is competent so as you are not at all bored whilst watching and the story is interesting with no glaring plot holes like Signs. M. Knight is returning to form after a run of bulls**t movies and I will actually go and see his next film in the cinema..and Signs Fu**ing sucked!!!!!",6,0,2,10 September 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Closing Walls and Ticking Clocks
","I can't say much without ruining this film so instead I will just give a very vague overview of the movie with no plot points and no spoiling will be done. As you will probably have guessed this movie has been anticipated since 2012 when the first Avengers had hit the screen. This sort of thing had never been done before on the big screen with a group of characters. It was the turning point and issued in the Golden age of Marvel comic book movies. Six years later we finally get to see Thanos and his search for the infinity stones. Thanos is probably the best Marvel villain since Loki and we see why he does terrible things. His reasons are actually quite justified in a sick sort of way and play on the human idea of overpopulation. For a film with so many characters I think the story does a great job of giving screen time to all however some of the characters do things that are out of character a bit. The film does drag on a little too much and has the habit of sometimes sacrificing a good character development scene for action. 
 
Saying that, the action sequences are probably the best in a long while from any marvel movie. Because this is the serious Marvel movie as well the comedy does suffer quite a bit and I does kind of kill the scene for me when a joke is said as it is not really in keeping with the seriousness of the film. The score is very great as well and they even threw in a new guardian of the galaxy song to announce when they are on screen. The score is pretty textbook slow piano stuff and the do use a lot of the dramatic violin which has become a bit of a clichÃ© at this point. Overall every technical aspect of this movie is flawless. The CGI works really well and it is everything we come to expect from a Marvel movie. This movie feels like an ending in every sense of the word. Things transpire and characters do irreversible things. It really felt like I was watching the peak of superhero movie franchises and certainly a change in the status quo of Marvel movies. Although I enjoyed the movie very much, I couldn't help thinking 'where do we go from here?' People have been saying for a while that superhero movies have had their day and infinity wars feels like a swan song.",10,2,6,27 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," the only thing worst than this is jar jar
","Star Wars the last Jedi has been a hotly anticipated film for me. I love star wars like most people and could not wait to see it.....Imagine my utter disappointment at this film. I spent TWO hours AND THIRTY MINUTES seeing something that sort of looked like the thing I loved but the characters were some warped versions of classic characters. I did not enjoy the story and the overall feel of this film was very stop start in terms of the plot. So let's get into what I hated and what was eh okay....ish.I'll start with what I loved. From a technical aspect this film is great. It's shot really well and has great use of camera angles, lighting and visual effects. There are some great little practical effects in the film that really help cement the Star Wars convention of the use of practical effects. The Music in this, as in all the other episodes, is fantastic. It is so good to hear John William's score and shows him to be still the master composer we all love. The music took me into the story as well as It could.Mark Hamill deserves a medal for his acting as I really loved the way he portrayed Luke regardless of how stupid Luke's story arc is. The late Carrie Fischer gave a brilliant performance and the BEST NEWS EVER....YODA IS BACK...as a cameo. Okay those are the things I loved now onto the biggest let down of this movie...THE PLOT AND THE 22000 SUBPLOTS!!! There is the main plot with Luke and his training of Ray. This is supposed to be the main one however we get very little training from Luke and Ray just basically knows everything anyway. Honestly she is so overpowered the training is not at all necessary and most of it is just Luke saying 'the Jedi must end' and that the force is bad.
 
Luke in this film is haggard, old and a completely different person to the one in episode 6. I won't give spoilers but it completely ruined the character for me and I felt angry at the way he was wrote. Ray as well is such a blank slate that I found her to have no character traits or development really. She learns nothing, and is even more powerful with no real effort, by the end of the movie.The plot with Finn is just, in the end, pointless and the casino setting that Finn and generic minority girlfriend #1 goes too looks basically like and casino in Vegas...It is just not Star Wars. They basically have to find a hacker to hack a first order ship. This hacker is so obviously going to betray them that when it does come it made me shout DUHHHH in the movie theatre. The other subplot is with Poe and the rebels trying to outrun a first order fleet at the slowest rate possible. This plot really slows the movie to a halt and just infuriated me by all the plot holes and stupid things that characters did. Poe doesn't trust the captain of the ship outrunning the first order and asks what she is doing. What's the plan? For some reason she tells his to get fuc**d and this leads Poe to take over the ship because of a lack of trust. WHY NOT INFORM YOUR CREW!!!!The way all of these plots and characters work do not make sense in terms of the movie and in terms of the larger Star Wars universe. That's the big problem I have with this film. I'm not alone. Even Mark Hamill said it was not 'his Luke Skywalker' and I just this everyone miscalculated in terms of plot and characters. The kicker is its such a long film and did not grip me or keep me emotionally invested for the two and a half hours. I think the script writers tried too hard with this film and as Grand Master Yoda said 'Do or do not there is no try'",3,2,3,23 December 2017
The Shape of Water," I loved this film and it hopefully will get an Oscar.
","The Shape of water will, in a few years, be one of those films that is a classic watch. It really made me feel emotional, there are a lot of characters who develop in natural ways and the whole story is simple yet effective. I will explain why I loved this film and will explain the few things I had a problem with. The pacing of the film is slightly stilted in places. No spoilers but in some scenes there are plot errors that you sit there thinking 'ok how did he know to go to the docks' or 'why did she not just do that in the first place'. Also the fact that the effects of the creature were practical, while commendable, left me feeling that more was needed CGI wise to make him look a bit more realistic. It's not a major thing for me if the plot has holes and the practical effects look a little shaky but it is a noticeable thing that took me out of the movie a bit which ultimately loses points. The story is just so beautiful. Del Toro's best story since Pans Labyrinth HANDS DOWN. It revolves mainly around a mute woman (Elisa played masterfully by Sally Hawkins) feeling incomplete in her life. Elisa does the same boring things day in day out BUT then happens upon this creature that is her missing piece. I strongly identified with Elisa as, on a personal level, I've felt incomplete at times, as if something is missing and sally Hawkins plays the role so well. The best thing about this film is this charming, unlikely love story that is told so well and with a great deal of emotion. All the actors bring their A game. Michael Shannon is brilliant as the security guy who is himself incomplete and tries to buy his way out of feeling this way. His character is a little cheesy in places like when he tries his scare tactics. They sometimes work and are menacing and other times the dialog feels clique and just copied from any other movie. Octavia Spencer gives a fantastic performance as Zelda. She also is incomplete and uses Elisa as a sort of therapy tool. She talks to her constantly as Elisa can only listen to her problems because she is a mute. He husband doesn't understand her and ignores her half the time so Elisa is doing all the listening which really adds another level to their friendship. This film is a great example of how a great supporting cast can add so much to a story and it added that extra bit of enjoyment to every scene for me. Technical stuff is really excellent and is very much in keeping with the period it is set in. There is a ballroom scene that is shot in black and white and is just wonderful to watch. The cinematography in this is excellent. There are a lot of greens, blues and teal colour pallets used to resemble the sea and the colours water gives off. When we deviate to a sub plot the colour seems to change giving me a sense of tonal shift that is just really interesting to note and separates the different characters from their respective plots. The 1950's/1960's music is brilliant and it help create the cold war atmosphere that this film is set in. It has a distinct theatrical theme that presents the romance as something that is 'straight out of the movies' and a romance that is just time less. Again going back the ballroom scene as a prime example of the way Elisa and the creature feel about each other. The music swirls all around like they are both swimming in one another's feeling for each other. Needless to say I found this film very emotionally powerful and entertaining. There are points that don't work and it's not a 10/10 but it made me look at my own sense of incompletion. At the end of the day isn't that what art is meant to do? Make you feel and look within to find a sense of self? For that reason this film will always be a favourite of mine. This film deserves at least one Oscar. Really Worth a Watch.",8,38,77,20 February 2018
Wonder Woman," Awful but a step in the right direction
","Thanks to movies like Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman the DC universe is known for its SH*T high budget flops that ooze product placement and awful plots. So I was not expecting anything going into this movie and was prepared to waste 2 hours of my life sitting watching a train wreck of a film.I was, however, a bit surprised when I watched Wonder Woman as it had some half decent scenes in it. The character interaction between Gadot and pine was believable and surprisingly charming. As well as some of the other characters too. For instance Charlie and Sammy are actually semi decent characters who have a few gags and are given something to do in the film. The plot, however, is really boring and falls short many times. Wonder woman suspects that Ares, god of war, is behind WW1 and goes to fight him while trying to find out who she really is. See how I just described the plot in 25 wordsthat's how simple and boring it is! There are no lessons learned and no real issues dealt with in the 2 hour time frame.There is a point near the end of the movie where I thought there would be a moral message about war being caused by bad people and not gods. Wonder Woman had just killed a guy who she thought was Ares and theWW1 did not stop because the god of war was 'dead'. Chris Pine says that maybe it was not Ares that started the WW1 but just bad people who want to do bad things.This would have deviated from the norm of having a big boss battle at the end, like in all superhero movies. It would have led to a great message about the evils of humans and I would have applauded it for doing something different. Instead Wonder Woman had to fight Ares and cause as much destruction as possible. So yeah a bit disappointed that they had a chance to do something different but instead took the easy way out with a big CGI action scene. In fact the action scenes in this movie are pretty poor considering Zack Snyder was attached to this film. Don't get me wrong he is a fu**ing Sh*t director, and I hate that I share a name with him, but he does put effort into his visuals at least. The director for this, Patty Jenkins, just cannot direct a good action scene. The fight scenes are just not interesting to watch and feel slow paced even though it is something dynamic happening in the scene. To her credit she is much better at character interactions than Snyder. This is clear if you see the interactions between Gadot and Pine in this film, and then compare it with Superman and Lois Lane in BvS. I guarantee that you will see that BvS has the weaker character acting because the director is terrible at getting the best out of his actors on set and only cares about visuals and product placement. The music for this film is garbage. The Wonder Woman score music that is like her theme song is jarring and annoying. The whole point of a song in a movie is to make you feel a connection to the character or scene you are watching. Wonder Woman's theme music completely takes me out of what's happening every time I heard it.The actual look of the movie was better than previous DC films. In this they actually tried colour in some shots and not underexpose everything in an attempt to create atmosphere. The editing whilst having a few continuity errors was good as well and certainly better than other DC films. All in all is Wonder Woman a good movieNO. The plot is boring, the action scenes are boring and the music is boring. No amount of good character interaction is going to make me feel that this movie is good. If DC took the character development of this movie and put together a coherent plot around it, with some good action scenes they would have a great movie. This movie is crap but is a step in the right direction.",3,3,9,6 September 2017
Blade Runner," This film is genius
","I watched this film a couple of weeks ago as the new 2049 one is coming out and I realised I had never seen the original before. People always told me it was a good film and worth watching. Having watched the film myself I can tell you these people are wrong. Blade Runner is a great film and you need to see it NOW!The film is gorgeous in every sense of the word. This film is very noir and reminds me of detective noir movies like the Big Sleep or the Maltese Falcon. As you can imagine the cinematography is perfect and the CGI for its time is pretty impressive. The CGI is almost akin to Star Wars IV in how good it looks.I love the scene in Tyrells office in the first 30 minutes of the film where Rachel is being interviewed. The use of colour and shadow in the office perfectly sets the tone for the interview between Rachel and Rick. The scene also illustrates why Ridley Scott is a great director. He is known in his movies for creating emotion trough darker surroundings and it's perfectly shown here. Ridley Scott has directed some brilliant movies like Alien, Thelma and Louise and Gladiator. However I think his best work has to be Blade Runner from a visual perspective alone.The music in this film is sublime. It is very synth heavy and perfectly captures the tone and theme of the film. In some parts the music is soft with just faint piano playing to give us a feeling of intimacy which works really well, especially for the scenes between Rick and Rachel. In other scenes we get a fast pace synth heavy track that compliments all the dynamic movement that the characters are doing in the scene. Vangelis knows what he is doing in movies and lends his skills as a composer expertly here. Hats off to you sir 'we are not worthy'!!!! The plot itself was based off a 1968 novel by Philip K. Dick called 'Do androids dream of electric sheep?' The film does not follow the book to the letter but the bare bones of the book are there and also the message behind it. The plot is a slow burner in places however there is a fundamental question posed to the audience. 'What makes something a human being?' The replicants in the film look like people, act like people and die just like people. There comes a point where the androids in the film become more human than the humans are and they express real emotions that are very complex for androids to understand.The plot deals with mortality and the fear of death as well. The whole motivation for the escaped androids is that they do not want to die. Roy Batty goes after the 'cure' to death and even goes so far as the meet his maker to try and stop death. When his creator says that escape from death is impossible Batty lashes out at first, and kills his creator and several others, however at the end of the film where he saves Rick Deckard from falling to his death he comes to some inner peace realising that death is inevitable. The plot of this film has so many interpretations and has been discussed so many times that it has taken on a life of its own. I even may have interpreted it differently to others however the fact of the matter is there is not right or wrong way that a film can make you feel, it is personal to you.The actors in this are brilliant. You can really tell that they gave a sh*t about the film and everyone brought their A game. Harrison Ford is great and gives one of the best performances of his career hands down! His scenes with Rachel where a high point as you could tell his infatuation was real and at the same time you saw Rick's torment as he realises Rachel is an android and not 100% human.Rutger Hauer is fantastic as Roy Batty and crosses the line between human and android so convincingly that whilst watching the film you see him become more human with every scene. The scene where his character dies actually makes you feel for a murderous android, and his line about his memories being 'lost in time, like tears in rain' had a certain melancholy feeling to the scene. All I can say is that this film is brilliant in terms of plot, acting, music, looks and feel. The pacing is a little slow in parts, which meant I did lose concentration the first time I watched it, but not so much that it distracts from the film. In short this is a true classic and a must see for Sifi NERDS. Go see this film you will not regret it.",9,2,3,8 September 2017
Deadpool," Different in a good way
","Deadpool is a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by generic, boring Marvel movies. Not all MCU movies are this way but there are a few that follow the same generic pattern like Ant Man, Thor the dark world and Doctor Strange. Of course the film takes place outside of the MCU and is coupled with the X-men movies made with 20th century fox who are not afraid to go out of their comfort zone. Sometimes it does not work, like in X-men age of apocalypse, but the nicest thing about this movie is it takes risks and succeeds. Is this film a masterpiece..NO however it was thoroughly enjoyable and went where not many comic book movies go. People die in this film and Deadpool does a lot of the killing without remorse and adding in some really funny lines that flow easily. Most of the jokes in this film make sense and add an air of comedy to the situation. However some jokes were not funny, in my opinion, like the 'brown pants' joke which falls short.Anyway the plot! Plot wise this film is simple, Wade Wilson (Deadpool) falls for a hooker, gets cancer, tries to save himself with experiments which give him a fast healing factor curing him but leaving him disfigured. He goes after the guy who did this and ultimately kills him and saves his girlfriend in the process. Nothing more to it.Simple plots are sometimes a great thing as they allow for characters to be introduced and interact in interesting and fun ways. Deadpool is shown to the world as a wise cracking, violent, forth wall breaking anti-hero and that is just what the audience want to see. The fact that none of these characters come to any realisation or develop is half the charm of the actual movie. In generic Marvel movies the character does develop in lame ways by either learning a new skill or learning to work together as a team something along those lines. This film has none of that and instead we are treated to nearly 2 hours of gags and violence. Honestly in this movie it is not a bad thing to have that as it is a unique experience and a break from the norm.Anyway onto the characters and the actors who play them. Ryan Reynolds does a great job as Deadpool. He is very charismatic, funny and acts the part of Deadpool. Like we can say Hugh Jackman IS wolverine we can also say that Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. In my opinion they could not have picked a better actor to play him. He just fits the idea of what most people think Deadpool should sound like and act like so well done Ryan.Ajax or Francis is a boring bad guy. His major thing is that he hates being called Francis for some reason?? It really triggers him as well which I found a bit retarded. Most villains are wronged in some way or have a traumatic experience. Ajax has none of these things and is a bit of a boring character to watch as he just fits the 'British bad guy' stereotype. If we take a villain like Loki or Magneto we see that really Ajax it not a very competent villain. His henchwoman that he hangs with is boring too and doesn't say any lines of interest. She is only in the film as muscle.The X-men are characters that work well in this film however they are the most stereotypical 'good guys' in a marvel inspired movie to date. This is not really a thing that destroys the movie or takes you out of things however I found their lack of depth a bit disappointing considering colossus can be a really interesting character if done right. If fact to say that most characters, in this film, stick to a stereotype would be a true enough statement.From a technical side the CGI is done really well and even the CG blood is done tastefully. The music is all popular songs instead of score and brings a sense of fun and playfulness to each scene, especially the violent scenes. The camera work on this film is pretty average for a superhero movie. However I do like the bits where the camera being there is used to break the forth wall and provide a bit of comedy to the scene.This film is great. I just wish it had a better villain and a little bit of depth to the supporting characters, not just Deadpool. However I would advise seeing it and hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Just the nods to other comic films and the Easter eggs in the film will be enough to satisfy the Marvel fan boys. The funny jokes and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool will be enough to satisfy everyone else.",8,1,3,20 September 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Really good film but bad supporting cast
","Kingsmen is a film filled with loads of funny jokes and great characters. The best thing about this film is how clever and stupid it seems to be. That may sound like a bad thing but let me explain. The film deviates from all spy films by having great jokes like a villain who is scared of blood and hero who is a wannabe gangster which makes it refreshing and clever. The stupidity comes from the ridiculous scenes that are a parody of spy thrillers like James Bond and the Bourne series. These parody scenes work so well with all the clever scenes and the self-awareness the film has with itself. The film follows spy movie conventions as there is a bad guy who wants to take over the world and the spy is sent to stop him from destroying earth with a virus of some kind. The bare bones are then layered with incredible characters and great, tasteful humour. All of the characters in this film are great and while I had some problems with the supporting cast I thought all of the main actors did a great job and portrayed good strong characters that all contribute to the plot and move it forward to a satisfactory conclusion. I think some honourable mentions go to what I would call 'the main guys'Colin Firth as Harry Hart is just such a great casting choice. He emulates a level headed spy who is just great at his job and fights with the class that the kingsmen agency is all about. Firth has not got a lot of comic lines but the action scenes he has are the best I have seen in a film in a long time. The 'manners maketh the man' scene is brilliant and is so well choreographed that it is hands down the best action scene in the movie with the possible exception of the church scene. Taron Egerton who plays Eggsy is really good in this movie also. He plays a wannabe gangster really well and we see during the film how he changes into a man who understands that actions have consequences. He has a lot of joke lines in this film and they work in the film so well. Some movies, like Ghostbusters 2016 will stop the plot to tell a joke however this movie has the right flow and a good quality script so that the plot is intertwined with the jokes. Egerton does a good job of acting like a chav turned spy would act. Samuel L Jackson as Valentine makes this movie for me. Having a villain who is grossed out by blood and violence is an inspired idea and Jackson does great work in this film and actually gave a sh^t about the character he was playing. Valentine has a legitimate reason for killing the population as he is worried about man's effect on the environment and has to save the planet by culling the population. This bit in the plot smells a little bit like Dan Brown's Inferno to be quite honest.However you soon get over that by how goofy and charismatic Valentine is, with his lisp and his love of McDonalds coupled with a good Dom Perignon to go along with it. The jokes that he has are masterful and I love how he remarks (in the film) that this is not an ordinary spy film. Honestly I think Valentine is the best character in the film.The supporting characters like Eggsy's mom and the drunk, abusive stepdad are the worst characters in the film. Chiefly because the actors playing them can't act and are very wooden in their performances. Even when the stepdad is being all manipulative and controlling the mom you never really believe in the performances they give and it adds such a different and violently sad tone to this movie that I actually wished they had not had so much screen time. Their parts you can just ignore anyway so it doesn't completely ruin the film but it does take you out of it due to their unrealistic and boring performances. From a technical point of view I think the movie works well with a lot of great camera work creating some good visuals and decent CGI. There was CGI blood which is never done realistically and in this film there are BAD CG blood moments but they didn't take me out of the film a lot and did not make me enjoy the action sequences any less. There were some bad camera panning where the camera would pan up and then to the right to show movement of characters from one place to another scene. However this was not used a lot and I can only think it was used in the train scene where Eggsy and Harry go to kingsmen headquarters. The music in this is used very well as a way of making the audience feel and adding emotion to a scene that needs a little umph. There are some great songs used in this movie and they all make sense in the points of the plot that they are used so well done whoever was in charge of sound in this film. All in all this film does have a few flaws and bad actors and crap CG blood use but its good points are really good. Great characters and great humour make this a film worth seeing and I advise you to go see it on DVD or download. It is worth it.",8,1,3,22 September 2017
