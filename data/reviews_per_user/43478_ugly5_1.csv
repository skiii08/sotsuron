Skyfall," Bond without swagger
","How can you create a James Bond character almost completely devoid of swagger and bravado? James Bond should drip with both, but he does not in this movie. In fact, I have to agree with another review where Bond was characterized as a bystander in the movie, reacting rather than driving the action. This Bond is also stupid. ***Spoiler*** He's surprised to learn that his flat was sold after he was presumed dead. An international spy can't anticipate that fact. His stupidity manifests again when he leads Sylva into a 'trap' at his boyhood home in Scotland. Where he failed to anticipate that the family gun collection would have been sold. Again, after he was presumed dead. AND he didn't bring any guns with him. This Bond reeks of incompetence.The soundtrack is also distracting...with the Bond theme heavily overused.Cinematography, however, is spot on. The Movie is beautiful.",2,13,29,8 November 2012
