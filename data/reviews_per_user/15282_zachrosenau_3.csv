The New World," A fine and devastating work of art
","How does one come to want to live with the likes of modern man, modern times? Who would not only help out, but come along for the journey, even when they didn't have to? That is the question of this film. When you see a bird in the sky, without a flock, you can ask how did the bird with its flock wish to fly off on it's own.I'm always somewhat shocked after seeing a Malick film. When something is truly what people tend to call original, it has this ability to destroy your foundations. Every part of this film is fundamentally new for cinema. From the disciplined beauty of the photography, the pacing of the film's story, and just the nimbleness with which Malick creates depth and character, space and devastating emotions, will make you rethink everything about how you thought they should come about.Malick is hard to talk about. Better to just watch his films, look through the eyes of his mysterious characters, and try to wonder about the world like they all wonder, think like they all think, and care like they care.The New World is a fine and devastating work of art.",10,7,15,4 February 2006
Collateral," Mann and Politics
","I'm distressed at the lack of interpretation that Mann's new film, Collateral, is receiving from American film critics. Mann's film is a politically charged allegory, not of professionalism, but of civic duty in an age of back-seated assassins. Could we not all understand Tom Cruises' Vincent when he remarks to Jamie Foxx's Max outside the gas station, 'Don't go getting other people involved - you'll just get innocent people killed!' as properly characterizing the Bush Administration policies in two ways? First, to dissuade the critical public (Max/Mass) from contesting that they 'can't drive you around while you're killing folks. It ain't my job!' And furthermore, that a vote against the confidence of the man with the guns is a vote for punishment. This has clearly been the case with the early right-winged screeching of 'Anti-patriotism' to anyone considering the war in Iraq as unjust. To Vincent, too, Justice and Politics are incommensurable.To elaborate, Vincent's preposterous claim later in the film after the nigh club showdown that he 'saved your life' is exactly the kind of logic that the Bush Administration practices when it argues that by killing thousands of angry and poor Middle Easterners that this can only be interpreted as saving American lives. The question of why the citizens of third world countries might be out to kill Americans doesn't appear to face most Americans today as immediately as Max assumes the question for himself.After all, it is his cab that is being 'taken for a ride.' Michael Mann has created a masterpiece of Political film-making, where the American Dream is reduced to a greasy postcard of an island where corporations relocate, go tax-free, and replace every American Flag with the taxi billboard of Bacardi Silver. But if American film reviewers are unable to read subversive cultural undercurrents, then we, unlike Max, will not wake up in the morning.",Null,0,0,12 August 2004
Vanilla Sky," A Richly Poor Film (spoilers)
","Cameron Crowe has not been able to tell a story since '96.  Vanilla Sky, far more flawed than Almost Famous, is very nearly about nothing at all. Every other scene talks about pop music, and every scene has two pop songs in it, yet the film is remarkably not about pop music.  Some may say it is about pop culture - okay then fine, what about pop culture?  It is vain?  I don't know how we can make this claim when clearly Crowe loves the album art of Freewheelin Bob Dylan and the film Jules et Jim, even though those narratives are what drive our protagonist David to his self-loathing suicide.  I just think he's a voyeur, a voyeur that wishes he was Tom Cruise and this is what we get out of his neurotic obsession with pop culture - this harrowing tale of confusion that is at times inspired and at other times haphazard - together with Sugga Ros and The Chemical Brothers and Jeff Buckley and Paul (stop now!) McCartney.  The film is jarring alarming, and poorly conceived in a very elaborate and richly designed way that is worth watching at least once.  It's fascinating how this man cannot tell a story.",Null,3,7,24 January 2004
