Saturday Night Fever," A music craze and a movie star are born.
","Saturday Night Fever is the 1977 instant classic that initiated a new kind of music that came to be known as disco, produced the number one movie soundtrack of all time, and made an official movie star out of John Travolta.Travolta plays Tony Manero, a 19 year old who has a go-nowhere job in a Brooklyn paint store and still lives with his parents. Manero's somewhat aimless life only seems to come alive when he puts on his silk shirt, his tight pants, and hits the local disco dance floor where he is king. Tony finds himself cut down to size by a snooty secretary (Karen Lynn Gorney), who he asks to be his partner in an upcoming dance contest.Director John Badham put together a story that the cherished 18-34 demographic ate up. His music video approach to the direction, some really electrifying dance sequences (with Tony's first solo to the Bee Gees' 'You Should be Dancing' a standout), and his complete confidence in his leading man combined to make this box office smash one of the most talked-about films of the year.There's a silly subplot regarding a rival gang that is hassling Tony and his crew and Karen Lynn Gorney's performance is beyond annoying, but these are minor distractions in what is a pretty solid drama with music. I would love to give credit to whoever choreographed Travolta's dance sequences, but so many people have claimed to have done it over the years, I'm really not sure who choreographed this film.Travolta was nominated for an Outstanding Lead Actor Oscar for his performance and there are a couple of strong supporting performances from Barry Miller as an insecure member of Tony's crew who idolizes him and Donna Pescow as Annette, a somewhat trampy and desperate regular at the disco who is madly in love with Tony but can't get him to give her a second glance.The Bee Gees provided a soundtrack that became a classic in itself and produced the number one movie soundtrack of all time. For anyone who grew up during the 70's, this film is a must",8,0,1,10 April 2015
Black Swan," Imaginative premise with too many plot holes
","Natalie Portman finally won a long overdue Oscar for her performance in Black Swan, a 2010 psychological drama set against the world of ballet about a dancer who is cast in the role of the Swan Queen in Swan Lake, despite the fact that the director has doubts about her ability to pull of the Black Swan, but then the Black Swan starts to dominate her personality to the point of actually losing her mind.Screenwriters Mark Heyman and Andres Heinz have come up with a strikingly original idea; however, there are plot holes you can drive a truck through, gaps in logic and continuity, and the story takes WAY too long to get where it's supposedly going. For instance, it appears that the black swan starts appearing initially when Portman's Nina Sayers starts seeing her doppelganger everywhere she goes, but this starts happening even before Nina gets the role. It's also revealed early on that Nina has an issue with self-mutilation, but it's difficult to tell which mutilation is real and which is going on in Nina's mind. There are even simpler problems that I had a hard time getting past. Nina is observed actually going to the director of the company and asking him for the role of the Swan Queen and then has the nerve to be shocked and offended when the man comes on to her. Speaking of which, this is one thing in the film that does ring true, the director of the company, Thomas, brilliantly played by Vincent Cassell. Cassell and Aronofsky perfectly capture the ego of the ballet choreographer, his God complex and a somewhat stereotyped method of using sexual analogies to get what he wants from his dancers onstage and then putting them to practice offstage. Love the scene where the director and Nina are rehearsing a scene with the black swan and he actually starts kissing and fondling Nina and then abruptly stops and explains to her that he just seduced her but in this scene she should be seducing him...this scene is brilliantly acted and directed.Mila Kunis turns in the performance of her career as Lily, the personification of the Black Swan whose manipulation of Nina leads to one of the most erotic sex scenes I have ever seen between two women, again, brilliantly directed by Aronofsky.Aronofsky is already a proved commodity as a director with The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream under his belt, I just wish he had a better screenplay to work with.Portman works hard to make Nina believable and I'm OK with her Oscar win, though I think Portman has done better work. Mention should also be made of Winona Ryder, surprisingly explosive as the diva that Nina replaced and Barbara Hershey as Nina's mother, even though Hershey's apparent plastic surgery was a bit distracting. The film is an interesting idea that almost works, thanks to the artistry of Aronofsky and Portman.",6,0,0,10 April 2015
Requiem for a Dream," A Harrowing Look at Addiction
","The war against drugs, of which we are fighting a losing battle, was effectively brought to the screen in 2000 in Traffic but the reason we are fighting this battle, the horrors of drug addiction itself and what it can bring you to, was the focus of another winner from 2000 called Requiem for a Dream, a bone-chilling look at the horror of drug addiction and the virus that the business behind it has become.The film, brilliantly realized by director Darren Aronofsky, weaves together three stories about drug addiction that clearly demonstrate that addiction does not discriminate and that no matter how an addiction starts or for what alleged positive purpose was its genesis, once the line has been crossed from recreational use into addiction (and we never know when that line is actually crossed), we all begin the same swift, downward spiral into a quicksand of consequences that usually leads to one of three places: jails, institutions, or death.The primary and most heartbreaking story revolves around a middle-aged woman named Sara Goldfarb, played by Ellen Burstyn, in a powerhouse performance that should have won her an Oscar, who begins taking diet pills so that she can fit into a particular dress that she wants to wear when she appears on her favorite television show, an event for which she has been planning for years, but has received no confirmation that it's actually going to happen. This story is particularly unsettling to watch because when we think of drug abuse we don't think about middle-aged women and we don't think about diet pills as being dangerous, but Sara's obsession to lose weight takes her to such a dark place that she starts hallucinating that her refrigerator is talking to her. Burstyn effortlessly imbues Sara with a sadness and confusion about what is happening to her that is positively haunting.Jared Leto plays Sara's son, Harry, a recreational drug user who is so deeply steeped in his own addiction that he doesn't see what is happening to his mother and decides that he and his running partner (Marlon Wayans), should start selling drugs but really don't have a clue as to what they're doing, evidenced by their complete ignorance about the first rule of selling drugs: Don't get high on your own supply. Watching Harry and his buddy's downfall is so pathetic because we can see all the mistakes they are making even if they don't.Jennifer Connelly turns in the performance of her career as Harry's girlfriend, Marian, whose casual use of drugs with Harry gets so out of control that Harry can't keep enough drugs around for her so she has to go elsewhere looking for them and doesn't care what she has to do to get that high she so desperately craves. Marian's addiction finds her taking prostitution to a dangerous place she never imagined, yet at the same time, not terribly concerned about how easy it is to get what she wants, using nothing more than her body.Hubert Selby's screenplay, based on his own book, pulls no punches and offers no apologies for this twisted look at drug addiction that, to the uninitiated viewer might seem a little over-the-top, but for those who have ever dealt with addiction or love someone who has dealt with it, there are emotions and events and images presented here that have a basis in reality. Aronofsky's bold directorial vision and some spectacular performances, especially Ellen Burstyn, make this film worth watching...it's not an easy watch, but there are rewards to be had here and it might actually make you think twice the next time someone offers to buy you a beer.",8,0,1,6 March 2015
The Hangover," It's Not Art, but it is funny.
","The Hangover is a raunchy, ridiculously over-the-top, yet consistently amusing 2009 comedy that isn't concerned with political correctness, logic, continuity, originality, or realism, but still delivers the laughs. I am classifying in it my 'Just put your brain in check and enjoy' file.The story bears more than a passing resemblance to a 2000 comedy called Dude, Where's my Car?, though it takes the premise of that film to a more detail-oriented level. This film is the story of Doug (Justin Bartha), a guy getting married in a couple of days who takes off to Vegas for a bachelor party with his friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), a married schoolteacher and dad and Stu (Ed Helms), a dentist you can serve on pie he is so whipped by his girlfriend (Rachael Harris), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) an insecure and neurotic mess who has trouble keeping his pants on and is also Doug's soon to be brother-in-law.The story then cleverly skips over the party itself and as we enter the guys' hotel suite the next morning, we see Stu and Phil passed out on the floor with a chicken crawling over Stu's head, a woman sneaking out of the room, a tiger in the bathroom, and Doug is nowhere to be found. The guys than wake up and actually find a baby in a cabinet. As the guys venture out to find Doug, further investigation reveals that the guys stole a cop car, that Stu married a hooker (Heather Graham) and that the tiger belongs to former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson.Though I think I may have already revealed too much, I still think there are plenty of raunchy and unexpected laughs found along the way here. Director Todd Phillips somehow manages to keep a tight rein on Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's screenplay, which really can't stand a lot of scrutiny.The cast serves the story well with standout work from Galifianakis and Helms and Phillips keeps things moving at a nice pace so that you don't find yourself looking at your watch. Make sure you stay tuned through the closing credits. Looking forward to the sequel.",7,1,2,9 April 2015
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," The Apatow Rep Comedy delivers the goods for the most part.
","Judd Apatow's position as producer probably had a lot to do with Forgetting Sarah Marshall being greenlighted, a fairly entertaining romantic comedy which provides fairly consistent giggles for most of its running time.Jason Segel, who also wrote the screenplay, plays Peter Brettner, a musician who has just broken up with his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall(Kristen Bell), a television star, who is now involved with a rock musician (Russell Brand). In an attempt to forget about Sarah, Peter vacations in Hawaii, and in true romantic comedy fashion, Sarah and her new guy are vacationing there as well. We then watch poor Peter running into Sarah wherever he goes while taking the attention of an attractive hotel desk clerk (Mila Kunis) for granted.Segel presents a very flawed and believable character in Peter, who is painted as this tortured sad sack while Sarah is painted as this cold-hearted bitch, which is not surprising since Segel did write the screenplay and if you're OK with that, you will probably be OK with everything that goes on here, even if it goes on a little too long, which is something I've come to expect from the Judd Apatow rep company.Segel and Kunis make a nice couple and Russell Brand is very funny as Aldous Snow, the arrogant but not as dumb as he looks rock star. Segal has provided some funny moments along the way for Jonah Hill as a waiter obsessed with Brand, Bill Hader as Peter's stepbrother, Kristen Wiig as a yoga instructor and especially Paul Rudd as a perpetually stoned surfing instructor.There are definitely some slow moments here and there, but Segel and company will hold your attention for most of the running time.",7,0,1,14 March 2016
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A solid cast but a screenplay all over the place.
","Crazy Stupid Love is a 2011 comedy that has some funny scenes, some clever dialogue, and a charismatic cast, but suffers from a rambling screenplay that tries to encompass a little too much and takes way too long to get where it's finally going.The film stars Steve Carell as Cal Weaver, a man rocked by the announcement from his wife of 25 years, Emily (Julianne Moore) that she has slept with a co-worker and wants a divorce. From there, the story expands into so many unexpected directions that it becomes a little dizzying to keep track of everything that's going on. It begins when Cal begins getting advice on getting back into the dating scene from a player named Jacob (Ryan Gosling) whose interest in helping Cal doesn't really make any sense.Jacob eventually gets involved with a woman (Emma Stone) who only shows interest in him after her co-worker/boyfriend (Josh Groban) breaks her heart. The story becomes even more complicated and murky as we finally learn who Stone's character is, but by this time, we really don't care because to be honest, Gosling has more chemistry with Carell than he does with Stone. The storyline involving Cal's son and his babysitter also walks the fine line between good taste and perversion, despite a superb performance from Jacob Bobo as the boy. But what this film does contain at its heart is a vividly human performance from Steve Carell as Cal, an actor with a lovely Jack Lemmon-ish everyman quality whose mere presence on screen evokes immediate sympathy and the desire to put your arm around him and tell him that everything is going to be all right and he is well-matched by Moore, who brings a calming center to the insanity that is the rest of the proceedings here. The screenplay is well-intentioned but goes horribly off-course, despite an extremely likable cast.",6,0,1,8 April 2015
Creed," Stallone's screen legacy really sell this one...
","In my review of Grudge Match, I mentioned how the filmmakers effectively mined the history the characters created in the past to strengthen a contemporary story. This concept works to even greater extent in 2015's Creed, an elaborately directed drama which specifically mines the legacy of the Rocky franchise but from a different direction and comes up with gold, respecting the legacy being saluted and keeping the legacy untarnished but utilizing it for creating a credible story.This film introduces us to Adonis Johnson, who turns out to be the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed, a young man full of anger and apparently full of passion for the sport of boxing, which has him leaving a very cushy life in Los Angeles to move to Philadelphia in order to seek out his father's former nemesis, Rocky Balboa, so that he can train him. Adonis has been using his mother's name because he wanted to make it in the ring without trading on his father's name and, ironically, when he gets a shot at exactly what he wants, that is exactly what he has to do.This multi-layered story has so much going on that at times it's hard to drink it all in and I found myself literally having to let certain things go and keep my eye on the prize, which is a compelling second generation story that once it grabs the viewer with its on target respect for the Rocky legend, grabs us almost immediately and never lets go.It's really lovely as we watch Rocky and Adonis enter Mickey's old gym and as we watch Rocky use a lot of the training techniques on Adonis that Micky used on him...I have to admit I was a little disappointed that Rocky and Adonis didn't visit a meat locker but I guess that was covered in Grudge Match.What I liked about Ryan Coogler and Aaron Covington's slightly padded screenplay is that it provides a new character for us to get behind connected to a proved legend, but unlike Rocky Balboa and Grudge Match, this story respects the fact that Rocky Balboa is no longer a kid and has no business stepping into the ring, instead he is in the corner of a young man with whom a connection inspires him to share his experience. The padding comes in the form of an underdeveloped romance for Johnson which just slows the film down.Coogler as director also managed to pull a star-making performance from Michael B. Jordan in the title role and a powerhouse performance from Sylvester Stallone that restores the dignity the character was stripped of in Rocky Balboa and earned the actor a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. Phylicia Rashad even demands attention in her brief role as Adonis' mother, but this is really Stallone's show...a fitting last hurrah for the character he created some 40 years ago",8,1,2,10 November 2016
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," The stars try and fail to keep this one afloat
","Despite charismatic leads and some funny situations, the 2003 comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days doesn't really sustain its paper-thin premise for the film's entire running time.The film stars Kate Hudson as Andie Anderson, a magazine writer who has been assigned to write the title article for her magazine and has chosen one Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) as the objective of demonstrating her article. Unknown to Anderson, Barry has bet co- workers that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days.his film, based on a pair of books by Michele Alexander and Jeanne Long, just doesn't possess the substance to actually admit to being inspired by two different books. I can't believe that it took 2 books to come up with an uninspired comedy that comes off as a tired retread of the Doris Day Rock Hudson comedies of the 60's.Donald Petrie's direction is a little on the pedestrian side, but the leads are attractive and there are effective supporting bits offered along the way by Bebe Neuwirth, Robert Klein, Adam Goldberg, Kathryn Hahn, and Celia Weston, but I guess your appreciation of the film depends on how much you love Hudson and McConaughey, whose obvious on screen chemistry just wasn't enough to make this film work.",5,0,1,30 November 2015
Home Alone," A Minor Classic
","John Hughes and Chris Columbus teamed together to bring us one of the biggest box office smashes of 1990...a little thing called Home Alone. A comedy that not only made a lot of money but made a genuine movie star out of the young actor playing the lead role.Macaulay Culkin lights up the screen as a young man named Kevin McAllister, a young boy who actually gets left behind when his family goes out of town for Christmas. Surprisingly, Kevin's realization that his family got a plane without him sits pretty well with him and he settles into the ultimate kid's fantasy of having the whole house to himself. Unfortunately, playtime is cut short when a couple of bumbling thieves (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) somehow get wind of the fact that Kevin is alone in the house, setting in motion a cartoon-like, cat and mouse game between good kid and the bad crooks that puts the best Tom and Jerry cartoons to shame.The film's enjoyment lies in the viewer's complete acceptance of the premise as a fantasy. Yes, Kevin is part of a very large family, but there is NO way any family would get on a plane to leave the country without double and triple checking to make sure that all the kids are present and there is also NO way that two grown men couldn't overpower a child if they wanted to. If you can check these two large lapses in cinematic logic at the door, the film can be enjoyable. Yes, the cartoon-violence that occurs between Kevin and the crooks is a little over the top, but it is what makes the film so funny.Culkin charms in the title role and Pesci and Stern work well together as Kevin's bumbling tormentors. Mention should also be made of Catherine O'Hara and John Heard as Kevin's parents, who are very funny in the opening scenes. Chris Columbus' direction seems to be based on Warner Brothers cartoons, but who doesn't like Warner Brothers cartoons? So check your brain at the door and you'll see why this film was one of the biggest hits of 1990.",7,0,0,19 March 2015
Juno," A sharp screenplay and wonderful performances
","Teen pregnancy is not a new subject matter for the movies, but it is given a strikingly original and fresh coat of paint in the 2007 film Juno, a riveting comedy-drama that provides consistent entertainment and flawed, believable characters that speak without filters and remain steeped in realism.The film stars Ellen Page as Juno MacGuff, a 16-year old girl who finds herself pregnant after a one night stand with her boyfriend (Michael Cera) who decides that she is going to allow the baby to be adopted by a seemingly happy, upwardly mobile couple named Mark and Vanessa (Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner) and how the plan veers in some very unexpected directions.Diablo Cody's brilliant, Oscar-winning screenplay anchors the proceedings because it skips over a lot of the clichéd issues normally addressed in films on this subject matter. I liked the fact that there was no discussion about Juno keeping the baby, I liked that she knows from jump that she is no position to be a mother and I like that Juno agreed to a closed adoption, meaning that once the baby is born, she hands him over and has no more contact with the baby or his new family. Also loved the unconditional support Juno received from her father (JK Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney).What I didn't like is the way Juno pretty much shut the father out of her initial decision-making and the relationship that develops between Juno and Mark really had me squirming...I knew it was wrong for Juno to be getting this close to Mark; on other hand, it was also clear to me early on that Mark and Vanessa were not as happy as they pretended to be for Juno. There is a wonderful scene between Bateman and Garner where they are looking at possible colors for the nursery and the tension between them is real and burns a hole through the screen, which can only be attributed to the skillful directorial hand of Jason Reitman, who had already proved himself to me with Thank you for Smoking.Ellen Page turns in a star-making performance in the title role, a performance that earned her an Oscar nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress and she receives solid support from Bateman, Simmons, Janney, and especially Jennifer Garner, who blew me away with the performance of her career as Vanessa, the woman who wants to be a mother more than anything and you just know is not going to be able to withstand another disappointment. Especially loved the scene where Vanessa ran into Juno at the mall and Juno allowed her to talk to the unborn baby in Juno's belly.Some inventive camera work and a lovely song score are the finishing touches on this unique and moving film that quietly sails through the soul to an extremely satisfying denouement.",8,0,1,14 April 2015
L.A. Confidential," The Best Film of 1997
","For my money, the best film of 1997 was LA Confidential, an atmospheric, richly complex, and completely riveting period piece centering on murder and police corruption in 1950's Los Angeles, superbly mounted by director Curtis Hanson.Brian Helgelund's flawless, Oscar-winning screenplay, adapted from a novel by James Ellroy, beautifully interlaces stories of growing organized crime in 1950's Los Angeles becoming a virus that is hard to control with police corruption that appears to be growing in equal doses.The film focuses on a series of brutal murders that become a primary focus for three very different kinds of cops. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) is a straight-laced by-the-books cop trying to crawl from under the image of his late father, also a decorated officer of the law. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a cop who is serious about getting a criminal behind bars and who is not above beating a confession out of a perp or planting evidence on him to guarantee a conviction. He also has a weakness for damsels in distress and will walk through fire for a woman he feels is in danger. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is an officer who is more passionate about his job as the technical adviser on a television show than his actual police duties. It is the flawless interlacing of these three characters and their individual methods in pursuing justice that make this drama sizzle.This film is so beautifully constructed and such complete attention is required that if you miss five minutes of this film and then return to it, you will be totally confused...for me, the primary aspect of a perfect screenplay.Hanson has pulled uniformly superb performances from his hand-picked cast right down the line, with standout work from Crowe and Spacey. Kim Basinger won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as a femme fatale who is central to the story and gets romantically involved with both Exley and White. Basinger is attractive in the role, but her Oscar win surprised me, though I will admit her chemistry with Crowe is off the charts here.Solid support is also provided by Danny De Vito, David Straithern, Ron Rifkin, Graham Beckel, and especially James Cromwell as various players involved in the twists and turns this story takes.Stunning art direction, cinematography, and costumes are icing on the cake in this textbook example of how to put a great crime drama on the screen. Remember: 'Off the record, on the QT, and very hush hush.'",9,2,3,4 March 2015
Milk," Penn, Black, Van Sant deliver the goods
","Sean Penn's mesmerizing Oscar winning performance is the centerpiece of MILK, the 2008 biopic about Harvey Milk, the tireless crusader of gay rights who became the first openly gay male to run for public office. Director Gus van Sant has mounted this intimate story on a massive canvas, utilizing stock news footage, gay activism education/information, and an intelligent, Oscar winning screening play by Dustin Lance Black to tell this compelling and emotionally charged tale of the man who put his entire life on the back burner as well as at a great personal risk to himself, to further the issue of gay rights. It would nice if homophobia could be put aside long enough for the heterosexual population to see a film like this and possibly gain a better understanding of this constantly tortured minority. Sean Penn won a richly deserved 2nd Best Actor Oscar for his passionate and fiery turn as this tireless Messiah for gay causes. The film also features a trio of sterling supporting performances from Emile Hirsch as a teen hustler that Milk converts into one of his followers, James Franco as Milk's lover who gets lost in Harvey's political shuffle, and especially Josh Brolin, in a brilliant performance that earned him a supporting nomination as Dan White, the conflicted, heterosexual San Francisco supervisor who worked alongside and against Milk simultaneously, leading to the downfall of both of them. A beautifully mounted film with a strong message that never becomes preachy, but stays with you long after the credits roll, featuring the performance of Sean Penn's distinguished career. Don't miss this one.",8,0,2,21 July 2013
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Black comedy at its Zenith...
","Never has the absurdity of war been so bitingly and accurately skewered as it was in the 1964 classic Dr. Strangelove: Or How Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. a scorching black comedy that sheds a very unflattering but unfortunately probably spot-on look not only at war, but the mental capacities of the people who have their hands on the button.Director Stanley Kubrick has created his masterpiece here, chronicling what happens when a clearly insane military general who triggers an attack on the Soviet Union that could lead to nuclear holocaust and how the President of the US and his advisers try to deal with the repercussions.Released during the infancy of the Vietnam War, this film probably ruffled a lot of feathers in Washington, though I don't know for sure, since I was only six year old at the time, but the film can now be cherished for the scathingly brilliant satire that it is.Kubrick's masterful direction is only surpassed by the brilliantly tongue-in-cheek screenplay by Kubrick, Terry Southern, and Peter George, that was clearly robbed of an Oscar. As for casting, it's perfection...Peter Sellers' powerhouse performance where he effortlessly brings three different characters to life is a joy to behold. Sellers, too, was robbed of an Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actor. My personal favorite of his three characters was President Muffley, who is given the best line in the movie and whose first phone conversation with the President of the USSR (Dimitri) to explain what's going on had me on the floor. Sellers has never made me laugh so hard, and I've seen most of the Pink Panther movies. Kubrick pulled the performance of his career out of Sterling Hayden as the insane general as was George C. Scott's bigoted military leader who is possibly as crazy as Hayden's character. Scott is brash and funny and was Oscar-worthy as well. Kubrick's attention to detail in bringing this epic story to life works on every level. The black and white photography only adds to the realism and there is impressive art direction and inventive camera- work, but it is the Oscar worthy work by Kubrick, Sellers, Scott, Southern, and George that make this one sizzle and earn it the well-deserved reputation of a classic.",9,3,4,9 December 2015
Knocked Up," More raunchy than funny with a really annoying leading lady
","From the mind of Judd Apatow came Knocked Up, a formulaic romantic comedy that provides some sporadic laughs thanks to the film's unconventional leading man.Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a party animal and all-around bum who meets a tightly wound television reporter for E named Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) who he meets one night in a bar. Though the meeting doesn't exactly set off fireworks, the two do go home together and have sex. Ben is thrown for a loop a couple of months later when Allison gets in touch with him to inform Ben that she is pregnant with his child.The rest of this 2007 film pretty much follows the formula you would expect from such a tired plot line except for the fact that Ben Stone is completely clueless regarding pregnancy and fatherhood and all that it entails and watching Ben navigate these very choppy waters provides the majority of the entertainment this film offers.Rogen is very funny as Stone but has no chemistry with Heigl, whose character is pretty unappealing and swallowing Stone's attraction to her is a bit difficult. Apatow's nutty rep company provide solid support, especially his wife, Leslie Mann as Allison's sister, Paul Rudd as her husband, and Jason Segel, Jonah Hill, and Jay Baruchel as Ben's burn-out frineds. There is also a lovely cameo by the late Harold Ramis as Ben's father. Like most of Apatow's work, the screenplay is overly complex and the film is a little too long, but Rogen and company still manage to make it a relatively entertaining ride.",5,0,2,12 March 2015
Taxi Driver," A Scorsese/De Niro Classic
","The directorial genius that is Martin Scorsese and the cinematic magic he has created with the gifted Robert De Niro was never seen to greater advantage than in the 1976 classic Taxi Driver.This is a chilling and bold character study that takes a look at the effects of loneliness, isolation, alienation, and PTSD and the effects that politics and violence can have on an already mentally shredded psyche. De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a slightly disturbed insomniac who gets himself a job driving a taxi because he cannot sleep and he basically has no life. We then watch as Travis' midnight to six sojourns throughout the violent underbelly of Manhattan and how his already questionable mentally instability cause him to become obsessed with murdering a political candidate and an equally strong obsession with a 12 year old prostitute who he decides it his responsibility to rescue from this life that he has decided for her she no longer wants to live. He also becomes obsessed with an icy blonde who works for the political candidate he wants to assassinate.Scorsese brilliantly recreates the seedy and often bone-chilling atmosphere of Manhattan after midnight, making Bickle's comfort in the atmosphere all the more unsettling, not to mention the atmosphere created by the few scenes that take place in Travis' apartment, a sparse place of convenience that contains a little more than a bed and some weights and the sparse equipment that Travis feels necessary to complete his 'mission.' Sometimes watching Bickle at home is even more unsettling than when he is in the taxi, making the character equal parts creepy, fascinating and pathetic. It's sad to watch how socially inept Travis is when he gets the blonde (Cybill Shepherd) to agree to go see a movie with him for their first date and he actually takes her to a porno film, not having any idea how inappropriate this is for a date movie and his confused reaction to her walking out is almost as heartbreaking as it is pathetic.De Niro gives a powerhouse performance as Bickle, which galvanizes the screen and mention should also be made of Jodie Foster's Oscar nominated performance as Iris the hooker and Harvey Keitel as her pimp, who are centrally involved in the film's shockingly violent denouement. De Niro received a Best Actor nomination as did the film for Best Picture. Fans of Scorsese and De Niro probably consider this film their masterwork and deservedly so.",8,0,2,4 March 2015
Gone Baby Gone," An unsettling but riveting story with a disturbing ending...
","The kidnapping of a little girl named Amanda McCready is the genesis for a dark and unapologetic drama from 2007 called Gone Baby Gone that offers disturbing surprises at every turn, rich with unsympathetic characters involved in an ugly story that literally had my stomach tied in knots for most of the running time.Set in the sleepy little hamlet of Dorchester, Massachusetts, we learn that Amanda has been missing for 36 hours and the police investigation seems to have stalled. Amanda's aunt (Amy Madigan) hires Patrick (Casey Affleck) and Angie (Michelle Monaghan), investigators specializing in missing persons to aid in the investigation. Amanda's mother (Amy Ryan) is a drug addict who has been working as a drug mule to support her habit and her actions may have been directly behind Amanda's disappearance, but this is only the beginning of one of the most bizarre criminal conspiracy involving addiction and police corruption. This is another one of those movies that is very difficult to review without major spoilers.More than anything, this film is a triumph for director and co- screenwriter Ben Affleck, who has mounted a story of stark realism where nothing is as it seems, most of the characters have hidden agendas and are not necessarily likable...this is the first film centered around a kidnapping that I recall where absolutely NO sympathy is evoked for the victim's mother...this woman appears to love her daughter and takes responsibility for what happens on the surface, but when we first meet her, she seems blissfully unconcerned and the picture of a woman who has no business being a parent.As I've mentioned in other reviews, actors turned directors seem to have a knack for getting great performances from their actors and this film is no exception. Ben puts a lot of trust in brother Casey in a complex role and he absolutely commands the screen here and works well with Monaghan, a relationship we are on board with as we meet them but this story tears them apart. Solid support is provided by Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, John Ashton, Titus Welliver, and especially Amy Ryan, in a gutsy and uncompromising performance that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.This film is not an easy watch, but it's worth the trouble and I promise that when you've finished watching this, if you're a parent, you will run immediately to your child and hug him forever.",8,2,3,10 November 2016
American Hustle," David O. Russell explores Scorsese territory
","David O. Russell followed up his brilliant Silver Linings Playbook with a somewhat effective excursion into Scorsese territory called American Hustle, an explosive and elaborately mounted period piece that takes a bitingly accurate look at the hedonistic 1970's and the art of the con, seen primarily through the actions of three characters that is allegedly fact-based. We are told at the beginning of the film that 'Some of this actually happened,' whatever that means.The main players here are Irving Rosenfeld, the owner of a string of dry cleaners who begins a very profitable confidence scheme with Sydney Prosser, a sexy and smart hustler who not only knows how to watch the bottom line, but how to manipulate it in her favor. Irving and Sidney's increasingly cushy existence is stalled by one Richie Di Masso, a smart-ass FBI agent who offers Irving and Sidney immunity in exchange for their help in aiding him to nail some much bigger fish, as well as lining his own pockets.Other key players on this complex but fascinating canvas include Irving's wife, Roselyn, a not as dumb as she appears housewife and mother, who refuses to be seen and not heard and is not above using Irving's son as leverage against him; Carmine Polito, the mayor of Camden, New Jersey, Stoddard Thorsen, Richie's boss, and a phony Arab sheik.Russell has undertaken one of his largest stories that is on the surface a look at the greed and hedonism of the 1970's but does whittle its way down to an intense look at mob and political corruption, keeping the involvement of actual mobsters and politicians to a minimum and the complicated triangle formed by the trio of central characters, anchored by a dizzying monitoring of Sydney'as loyalties, which is the apex of the triangle primarily because Sydney really is the smartest character in the movie. Unfortunately, the film does lose a few points in the originality department, as images of Scorsese work like Goodfellas and Casino leap to mind, minus a lot of the in your face violence we get from Scorsese.The performances are, for the most part, first rate. Christian Bale, cinema's second greatest chameleon behind Jared Leto, undergoes a remarkable physical transformation to bring the slick yet pathetic Rosenfeld to life, though he really just seems to be sort of channeling Robert De Niro. Amy Adams turns in the performance of her career as Sydney, a rich performance that effectively nails the character's intelligence and vulnerability. Bradley Cooper scores with his slick FBI agent too, though I think he was better in Silver Linings Playbook. Jennifer Lawrence offers another explosive performance as Roselyn that rivals her Tiffany in Silver Linings and Jeremy Renner is an eye opener as Mayor Carmine.As with most of his work, Russell's direction trumps his writing, which, as always tries to encompass a little too much, but most of the film's running time is legitimized. Russell, Bale, Adams, Cooper, and Lawrence were all nominated for Oscars and I think Adams should have won, an actress I once thought of as a one-trick pony who has proved to be anything but. The film also boasts a kick-ass song score of some of the greatest music from the late 70's early 80's. Russell makes a mighty big leap into Scorsese territory here and though not completely successful, has mounted a watchable film that sustains interest for most of its running time.",7,1,3,12 December 2015
Cast Away," Another triumph for Hanks and Zemeckis
","After winning Oscars for Forrest Gump, star Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis teamed up for a 2000 epic called Cast Away, a compelling and well-made drama but, for me, a very difficult film to watch, with minimal re-watch appeal.Hanks plays Chuck Noland, an executive with Federal Express whose life is changed forever when he is involved in a plane crash, which he survives and ends up stranded on a deserted island for four years. No episode of Gilligan's Island here as we watch this man, initially in denial about what has happened to him, anticipating rescue in a few days but as time passes, he can no longer deny what is happening to him and must learn how to survive, while simultaneously trying to cling to his sanity, evidenced in an actual relationship he develops with a volleyball, which he names Wilson and takes care of like a newborn baby.This film is challenging because it goes places where other plane crash dramas have never gone. For example, there is a horrific moment when Chuck actually discovers the body of the pilot of the plane and goes through his wallet. I don't ever remember a film like this where the body of someone who didn't survive was even mentioned let alone revealed. The film also takes its time in having Chuck accept his plight. I like the way Chuck keeps his clothes on initially because he really thinks he's going to be found quickly, but eventually he starts wearing less and less to the point where he is just in a loin cloth and his pants are now covering his head. Even common health issues come to the surface here when Chuck develops a toothache and has no choice but to pull the tooth out himself, a scene I literally cannot watch anymore.Director Zemeckis employs a keen eye for detail and realism here...this film contains what is probably the most frighteningly realistic plane crash I have ever seen in a movie. The moments before the plane hits, the panic in the pilots voices, Chuck's iron-fisted clutch of a picture of his fiancée (Helen Hunt), it all rang true and was just horrifying to watch and when Chuck was literally underwater trying to fight his way out of the plane, I was literally holding my own breath. Another Zemeckis touch to ensure realism is that after the initial scenes up to the plane crash were filmed, he shut down production of the film for a couple of months to give Hanks time to lose 30 pounds, to make his desperate diving for fish in the ocean look more desperately authentic and to show that Chuck was no longer eating regularly.Zemeckis also knows how to make his viewer squirm, particularly in his depiction of Chuck's relationship with Wilson...the moment when Wilson falls off the raft and Chuck is unable to save him is heartbreaking and pathetic. You feel for Chuck while at the same time, you can't help but think, 'Uh...it's a volleyball.'One of my absolute favorite cinematic pictures occurs in this film as well...the shot of Chuck's raft quietly floating in the ocean as a giant ship floats by right next to him.This film is beautifully made and tells a very difficult story. Tom Hanks received a richly deserved Oscar nomination and Helen Hunt makes the most of her small role as his confused fiancée, but this film is really hard to watch. Putting myself in Chuck's shoes was a very uncomfortable experience that I don't wish to duplicate. It's a superb movie and I'm glad I saw it, but I have no desire to ever see it again.",8,0,0,16 April 2015
The Shining," Nicholson makes you forget that it barely resembles the book
","The directorial artistry of the late Stanley Kubrick and a powerhouse performance by Jack Nicholson are the primary selling points of 1980's The Shining, a chilling and atmospheric psychological thriller based on Stephen King's most famous novel.This version of the story stars Nicholson as Jack Torrance, a severely blocked writer with a wife and child, who agrees to take a job as the off-season caretaker of an isolated hotel called the Overlook, located in the snow-buried rocky mountains of Colorado. He thinks the isolation might aid in his writer's block, even after learning that the previous caretaker went crazy from the isolation and killed his wife and twin daughters. We then watch Jack move his wife, Wendy and his son, Danny into the Overlook and the viewer watches and wonders if the same thing is going to happen to Torrance. We also learn that young Danny has a connection to the hotel that his parents know nothing about.Despite the fact that this film is basically a shell of the novel it is based on, it is still bone-chilling entertainment, thanks primarily to Kubrick's ability to unfold such an intimate story on such a huge and menacing canvas. The claustrophobic atmosphere that Kubrick creates here is so effective...the Outlook almost feels like it's on another planet, it seem like it's a billion miles from civilization and the fact that everything we see is blanketed in snow makes it seem even more removed from reality. Kubrick creates a cinematic atmosphere here that is chilling and completely engrossing.Jack Nicholson is absolutely electrifying as Torrance, an everyman with issues that he would like to bury but his isolation at this hotel and unhappiness with his own life, which he is in denial about, that makes Torrance's journey into insanity so riveting...it's not just the big moments but watch Nicholson when he learns abut what happened to the previous caretaker, or when his son begins to question his and his mother's safety, or my personal favorite, his conversation with the imaginary bartender in the hotel's elegant ballroom...even though we know this is all going on in Torrance's mind, Nicholson's investment as an actor makes us believe everything we are watching. Shelley Duvall is shrill but effective as Jack's wife Wendy, a woman who begins unraveling, torn between devotion to her husband and protecting her life as well as her son's.Almost in the tradition of Scorsese and De Niro, Kubrick and Nicholson created a formidable director/actor collaboration that, sadly, didn't develop into further work, but it should have. Kubrick and Nicholson created a classic here that should not be missed. Later remade by ABC television as a 4-hour miniseries with Steven Weber as Jack Torrance.",8,3,6,12 March 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," A blistering drama rich with sharp performances
","Writer/director David O. Russell, who first caught my attention with Three Kings hit a bullseye and created his masterpiece with Silver Linings Playbook, a quietly intense, strikingly original, and blistering drama that simultaneously tells a fascinating story and affords the viewer the opportunity to imagine the backstory without ever taking our focus away from what is happening on the screen. I haven't seen anything this original on the screen since Being John Malkovich.The 2012 film stars Bradley Cooper as Pat Solatano Jr., a former teacher who apparently had a mental/emotional meltdown of such intensity that he lost his job, his ex-wife divorced him and put out a restraining order against him, got banned from the school where he worked, and was committed to a mental institution. As the story unfolds, Pat is being released from the institution, thanks to his mother, after eight months and against medical advice and moves in with his parents, with one mission on his mind and one only: to reconcile with his ex-wife Nikki. Enter Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a friend of a friend of Nikki's, with issues of her own, who is aware of Pat's obsession with Nikki and uses it to her advantage to get what she wants from Pat, which turns out to be more than she thought and is in deep denial about.Russell's Oscar nominated screenplay based on a novel by Matthew Quick, fascinates because despite the fact that the two lead characters speak without filters and are searingly honest about their feelings, while at the same time, we are never told exactly what happened eight months earlier that actually landed Pat in the institution and I found my imagination running wild trying to imagine exactly what Pat had done. As a matter of fact, as I watching the film at one point, I actually said to myself regarding the character of Pat that this guy speaks without filters and about five minutes later, the character actually said the exact same thing on screen. I loved the fact that even though Pat does speak without filters, he never revealed exactly what he did to land him in his current position and is in complete denial about the fact that Nikki no longer wants anything to do with him. Russell's direction, which also got him an Oscar nomination, is on the money, particularly in his depiction of the the other characters in Pat's orbit. It was so fascinating to watch the reaction of people in Pat's Philadelphia neighborhood to his return...every time the slightest noise comes from the house, all of the neighbors pop out of their windows to see what's going on. There's a great moment where Pat briefly returns to the school where he taught in an effort to get his job back and we see a teacher literally run into the building in terror when she sees him coming. Again, it forces the viewer to wonder what the hell this guy did that prompted this kind of reaction from a former co- worker. We notice throughout that people are either frightened of Pat or walk on eggshells around him and this is done without dialogue for the most part, and that can only be credited to evocative direction.Bradley Cooper turned in the performance of his career, that should have won him an Oscar, as Pat, a tragic figure trying to start his life over without really facing the demons of his past and his inability to accept the fact that his ex-wife wants nothing to do with him. Jennifer Lawrence won the Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actress for her explosive Tiffany, a character whose vulnerability is only overshadowed by her unpredictability...you NEVER know what this girl is going to do from one moment to the next and that's what makes the character so fascinating to watch.Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver also received supporting actor nominations for their performances as Pat's parents, people who are so consumed with love for their son that they too seem to be in denial about the fact that they might have checked Pat out of the institution prematurely. De Niro has rarely been so quietly moving on screen and Weaver is just superb and should have won Best Supporting Actress. Mention should also be made of the performances of John Ortiz and Chris Tucker as friends of Pat from the inside and the outside who support him no matter what. This is the closest thing to an actual human being that Tucker has ever played.A one-of-a-kind motion picture that will haunt long after the credits roll and demand multiple viewings.",9,0,5,19 March 2015
The Exorcist," An instant classic that redefined its genre...
","The Exorcist was the 1973 instant classic that broke box office records, broke all the rules about the horror/terror genre, angered religious leaders all over the world, made theatergoers physically sick, generated some innovative techniques in the art of visual effects, and IMO, was robbed of the Oscar for Best Picture of 1973.The film is based on a novel by William Peter Blatty from which Blatty fashioned the screenplay and was directed by William Friedkin, fresh off his Oscar-winning work on The French Connection. This is the story of an actress named Chris MacNeill (Ellen Burstyn) who has recently moved to Georgetown with her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) in order to make a movie. Seemingly out of nowhere, Regan begins exhibiting bizarre behavior which Chris finds out that doctors and a barrage of tests cannot properly explain. Chris is dumbfounded when it is finally suggested to her that Regan is the victim of demonic possession and the only way to help her is an exorcism, a religious ceremony that hasn't been performed in decades. Enter Father Damian Karras (Jason Miller), the priest who is going through a crisis of conscience due to the death of his mother, which the demon inside Regan seems to know about and uses it against Karras to fight being driven from Regan's body.This film terrified film audiences all over the world, even though most of the scares in this film are more repellent than actually scary. Friedkin and Blatty do know how to tell a compelling cinematic story that unfolds slowly without playing all its cards right away. It starts with noises in the attic and then Regan's urinating on the floor in front of Chris' party guests as clues that things are not as they should be, but doesn't really foreshadow what's going on either.Ellen Burstyn was robbed of the Oscar for Best Actress for her bewildered and angry Chris MacNeill and playwright Jason Miller made an impressive acting debut as Karras, a performance that earned him a supporting Actor nomination. Linda Blair became a movie star and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her Regan, a performance that a lot of people thought was cosmetically constructed through makeup and special effects and that might be why she didn't win. Max Von Sydow is properly creepy as Father Merrin, the priest who helps Karras with the exorcism and Lee J. Cobb is fun as Lieutenant Kinderman, the detective who becomes involved with the story when the director of Chris' film (Jack MacGowran, who actually died during production) is actually murdered by the demon inside of Regan. The voice of the demon is provided by Oscar winner Mercedes Macambridge.This is a once-in-a lifetime cinematic experience that has to be seen to believed. It spawned many clones and imitations but this is the granddaddy of them all. Followed by two sequels.",9,1,1,14 March 2016
Tropic Thunder," A Triumph for Ben Stiller
","2008's Tropic Thunder was a scathingly dark and roll-on-the-floor funny satire and an on-target look at behind the scenes Hollywood that was a triumph for its director, co-writer, and star, Ben Stiller. This film is on the surface a satire of the film Apocalypse Now and the subsequent documentary Hearts of Darkness and if you watch closely, you will also notice affectionate winks at films like The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, and even Scarface. I love when films make fun of Hollywood and let us in on the joke and Stiller has let us in on the joke with a vengeance here.The film has a brilliant opening which shows trailers and music videos of the various stars before they begin work on the movie-within-a-movie of the title. The film is then joined on location where it has gone millions over budget, forcing the director to take a new tack and flying the five principal actors to a remote Vietnamese location, at which time the director is accidentally killed, but the lead actor is convinced that it is a hoax and that the director wants them to continue the film on their own. Filming is complicated as the lead actor begins a descent into madness while being kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese drug dealers who he thinks are actors. Things get even messier when the villains mistake our hero for the mentally retarded character he played in a previous movie.Ben Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, the lead actor whose career has been primarily manufactured through an action franchise called Scorcher. Robert Downey Jr. plays Kirk Lazarus, a five-time Oscar winning Australian actor who has had an operation to alter his pigmentation so that he can play an African American character in the movie. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a drugged out comic actor making his first foray into the action genre. Brandon T. Jackson plays Alpa Chino, a rap star making his film debut and Jay Baruchel plays Kevin Sandusky, a struggling actor appearing in his first major role.Watching the interplay between these five characters had me rolling on the floor from opening to closing credits, particularly the exchanges between Lazarus and Chino, as Lazarus seems to be descending into his own mini-madness where he almost forgets that he is Caucasian and how it annoys Chino to no end. Robert Downey Jr. is nothing short of brilliant and just about steals the movie as Lazarus, in a characterization that is so off-the-wall yet steeped in enough realism that the performance earned Downey an Oscar nomination. I lost it every time Chino felt the need to remind Lazarus that he wasn't black. Baruchel made an appropriate voice of reason among the group and Jack Black's character gets funnier as he starts jonesing for drugs. Mention should also be made of a trio of supporting turns from Danny McBride as the maniacal special effects director, Matthew McConaughey as Tugg's fast-talking agent and especially Tom Cruise, almost unrecognizable but hysterically funny as the producer of the film who thinks Tugg's kidnapping is a hoax and is willing to throw him under the proverbial bus (or rice patty if you will). There's even a classy turn from Nick Nolte as the author of the book the movie is based on.Stiller's direction is detail-oriented and immediately conjures up the images of the films that are being saluted here. His screenplay with Justin Theroux is brutally accurate in its cynicism as well as its realism and is brilliantly served by a perfect cast. One of the funniest movies I have seen in years that will demand repeat viewings.",8,0,1,8 April 2015
Enchanted," Disney Magic with a Contemporary Spin
","The 2007 film ENCHANTED is a deft and imaginative musical/comedy/fantasy that breaks several cinematic rules in its execution of a richly entertaining story that intrigues and delights the viewer. The film opens as an animated fairy tale where we meet Giselle, a princess who, shortly before her marriage to Prince Edward, is magically transported to modern day Manhattan, thanks to Edward's mother, the requisite Evil Queen, where she is befriended by an attractive attorney and single dad. Giselle's fish out of water experiences in Manhattan blend seamlessly with the arrival of Prince Edward, the queen's henchmen, and the Evil Queen herself, who also arrive in New York to return Giselle to the kingdom of Andulasia. The story takes most of the turns it's expected to, but the journey there is the fun here, as the the old cinematic chestnut of the fish out of water, is dusted off and refashioned into a contemporary fantasy filled with child-like imagination and adult sensibility. Amy Adams is perfection as Giselle, the princess transported to modern times who believes that love is everything, animals clean house, and pigeons deliver flowers. Adams' wide eyed sincerity and clear as a bell singing voice help to make this performance the flawless marriage of actress and character. Patrick Dempsey and James Marsden are attractive as the single dad who Giselle falls for and her fairy tale prince who want her back. Timothy Spall provides some funny moments as the Queen's henchman and there is a brief, but fabulous scenery-chewing turn by Susan Sarandon as the Evil Queen. Tony winner Idina Menzel (WICKED) also scores as Dempsey's girlfriend (BTW, note to continuity dept: during the course of the film, we see advertisements for WICKED and for RENT, two Broadway shows supposedly running at the same time, that both starred Menzel, but I digress). The film is energetically directed by Kevin Lima and the surprisingly clever song score is provided by Alan Mencken (THE LITTLE MERMAID) and Stephen Schwartz (PIPPIN; GODSPELL). Top it off with some top-notch visual effects and cinema's most durable sidekick, Pip the Chipmunk and you have all the ingredients for a first-rate adult fairy tale that provides some big laughs in addition to the expected warm-fuzzy feelings.",8,1,1,22 July 2013
No Country for Old Men," The Cohen Brothers Strike Gold with another winner
","Joel and Ethan Cohen brought home the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2007 with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, a dark and chilling suspense thriller which takes the classic cat and mouse chase genre to an entirely new level. The film stars Josh Brolin, in his finest performance to date, as a schnook who happens upon the remains of a brutal crime scene, where he finds several dead bodies, a huge shipment of heroine, and a case containing two million dollars and the consequences of his fatalistic decision to take off with the money, prompting his being hunted by a cold-blooded assassin (Jarvier Bardem), who will stop at nothing to get his money back. Throw in a laid back Texan sheriff (played to perfection by Tommy Lee Jones)assigned to the case and you have all the ingredients of a first class thriller. This gritty and uncompromising drama pulls no punches and offers no easy solutions to a myriad of questions it raises, most notably, 'Did this guy really think he could get away with stealing two million dollars?' The film is dark and atmospheric, creating such a height of suspense that there is virtually no music score and you really don't miss it. The suspense created by the story propels the film itself. Jarvier Bardem won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his bone-chilling performance as Chagur, the deadly and apparently conscience-free killer chasing Brolin. Bardem creates one of the most terrifying cinematic villains ever, whose brutality is only surpassed by his unpredictability. The Cohens have crafted an intricate story that does peter out toward the end, but for the majority of its running time, will have you literally holding your breath. Not quite up the standards of their classic FARGO, the film is still practically a classic that improves upon repeat viewings and reinforces Joel and Ethan Cohen as filmmakers to be reckoned with.",8,2,3,22 July 2013
Mamma Mia!," Streep makes it worth Watching
","MAMMA MIA! is a joyous musical romp, the film version of the long running Broadway musical based on the music of 70's pop group Abba. The film stars Meryl Streep as Donna, the lusty and free spirited innkeeper who runs a broken down hotel in the Greek Islands, who is rocked by the arrival of three former suitors (Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard)in Greece for the wedding of Donna's daughter, Sophie, not knowing that one of them is really Sophie's father, though Donna is not sure which one is the real Daddy. This paper-thin plot line serves as the basis for an amusing and spirited musical journey exploring Donna's regrets about her past and Sophie's search for a future identity through knowing who her real father is. Filmed on location in the Greek Islands, the film is visually stunning and should really be experienced on a big screen. Streep, as always, commands the screen as Donna, giving a rich performance that almost makes you forget you're watching a musical. Amanda Seyfried is charming as Sophie offering an impressive turn in her first real leading role. There are also a pair of razor sharp supporting performances from Christine Baranski and Julie Walters as Donna's best friends, also in town for the wedding. The film features beautiful location photography and some very inventive staging of musical numbers, which include 'Dancing Queen', ' In a Rich Man's World', 'The Winner Takes it All', 'Our Last Summer', 'Take a Chance on Me', and of course, the title tune. Not for all tastes, but for fans of musicals and Streep, a must.",6,0,0,21 July 2013
Bridesmaids," It's Likable, but that's about all.
","Bridesmaids is a silly and watchable 2011 comedy that provides relatively consistent laughs throughout but suffers from the same disease that is afflicting a lot of contemporary comedies these days: The nucleus of a very funny movie is here, but attempts to pad the screenplay with unnecessary subplot and exposition really slow down the proceedings.The film stars Kristen Wiig (who also co-wrote the screenplay) as Annie Walker, a woman thrilled that her BFF Lillian (Maya Rudolph) is engaged and that Lillian has asked Annie to be her maid of honor. Things get complicated when Annie meets another bridesmaid named Helen (Rose Byrne), a snooty socialite who is marred to Lillian's fiancée's father, who Annie believes is trying to replace her as maid of honor. This part of the movie totally works and the scene where Annie and Helen are trying to get the last word during the wedding toasts is probably the funniest scene in the movie.The movie suffers when it moves to a romantic triangle between Annie, her current boyfriend (Jon Hamm), a slimeball who treats her like dirt and the cop she meets cute with (Chris O'Dowd). This subplot just brings the movie down because Wiig had way more chemistry with Hamm than she did with O'Dowd. I never bought the relationship with O'Dowd and maybe this is why it was felt necessary to show us how lonely Annie really is. We actually got a 10 minute scene of Annie baking a very elaborate cupcake, which seemed like a gift for a boyfriend but she eats it herself, easily the film's most pointless scene.The movie suffers when it moves to a romantic triangle between Annie, her current boyfriend (Jon Hamm), a slimeball who treats her like dirt and the cop she meets cute with (Chris O'Dowd).

Man on the Moon," Carrey's remarkable performance makes this one work
","The late Andy Kaufman was a tortured soul who wanted fame on his own terms and didn't care if others were in on the joke or not. This seems to be the permeating theme of MAN ON THE MOON, director Milos Foreman's rambling 1999 biopic about the comedian, who would achieve his greatest fame as mechanic Latka Gravas on the ABC series TAXI during the 1970's. This film explores Kaufman's humble beginnings in dingy comedy clubs to his unnerving appearance on the premiere episode of Saturday NIGHT LIVE, his tenure on TAXI and his invasion of the WWF, which ballooned into a full blown feud with WWF wrestler Jerry Lawler. The film shows Andy's consistent discontent with his success and how no matter what he achieved, it wasn't enough. This purely evidenced in Kaufman's obnoxious alter ego, Tony Clifton, who Kaufman tirelessly worked at creating a separate career for, despite the fact that no one was interested. The film aggravates as we watch Kaufman constantly put up roadblocks to his own success, but also fascinates due to the mesmerizing performance by Jim Carrey in the title role. Carrey channels Kaufman flawlessly, in a performance that's positively spooky in its accuracy and should have earned Carrey an Oscar nomination. Kaufman, I mean Carrey, gets solid support from Danny DeVito, who plays George Shapiro, Kaufman's agent and Paul Giamatti, who plays Bob Zmuda, Kaufman's co-writer and co-parter in conspiracy and the only one in all of Kaufman's jokes. Courtney Love's performance as the leading lady is a matter of taste, but it really doesn't matter because this is Jim Carrey's show all the way and he makes the film worth watching. The film also features appearances by Jerry Lawler, Peter Bonerz as TAXI producer Ed Weinberger and TAXI cast members Judd Hirsch, Jeff Conaway, Marilu Henner, Christopher Lloyd, and Carol Kane. A long but involving look at one of show business' most tragic figures and I'm not completely sure that it's over.",7,0,0,21 July 2013
Behind The Candelabra," A triumph for Steven Soderbergh and everyone involved.
","HBO spared no expense in bringing BEHIND THE CANDELABRA to fruition. This lushly mounted TV movie tells, in intimate detail, warts and all, the story of the very rocky six year love affair between a dog trainer named Scott Thorson and the flamboyant showman Liberace. This movie scores big not only in production values and on-target performances, but in a story that provides something that is so rare in movies like these: balance.Richard LaGravenese's screenplay is based on Scott Thorson's book, so it's most likely that the facts presented here are pretty much what happened. What surprised me (pleasantly) is that the screenplay does not present Liberace as this big rich gay ogre who lured this naive young boy into his lair of sexual iniquity, expensive jewelry, and fancy cars. Liberace wanted Scott and dangled a lot of pretty things in front of him but Scott was perfectly aware of what was going on and entered the relationship with his eyes open, despite what anyone might say. We not only get to see the young hayseed get his head turned by the glamour of Hollywood and the initial constant attention of a show business icon, but we also get an up close and personal look at the icon...aging and terrified about it and actually trying to perpetrate the illusion that he was heterosexual, which the film implies that he did really well, but I just find it so hard to believe that people believed this man was heterosexual. What we also see is an aging gay man whose wandering eye is always looking for the next better built and younger thing as Scott's relationship goes full circle.Michael Douglas won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his dazzling interpretation of the legend...this is the 3rd movie made on the subject but no one has ever brought the humanity to Lee that Douglas has. Douglas is completely invests in playing a homosexual character without resorting to stereotyped gay behavior or over-the-top lisping. On the other hand, I love during Lee's first meeting with Scott, Douglas looks at him like a steak smothered in onions.Matt Damon's Scott Thorson is a fascinating character journey that Damon makes completely believable...Damon has not been this sexy and charismatic on screen since THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY. It appears that Damon created Scott from the outside in, starting with the clothes, the hair, etc. and created a character we come to care about, even if his naiveté is sometimes a little hard to swallow. Watching his descent from small town innocent to dangerously obsessive and jealous drug addict is not pretty and Damon doesn't shy away from it at all. There's also a couple of effective supporting performances from Dan Aykroyd as Lee's agent and Rob Lowe as a slick plastic surgeon who gets Scott hooked on diet pills and talks him into surgery that would make him look more like Lee, an idea of Lee's that I was shocked Scott consented to.The film also boasts superb production values with absolutely superb work from the makeup team, who made Debbie Reynolds unrecognizable as Liberace's mother and gave Douglas a look in his final bedside scene that actually made me gasp. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time that was a biography and a love story but no clear villain...and I liked that.",9,1,5,6 May 2015
Django Unchained," Tarantino's Uncompromising views about race relations in a period setting.
","Quentin Tarantino again displays his propensity for cinematic storytelling with Django Unchained, an engrossing and bloody epic that establishes new credentials for Tarentino in the fact that he utilizes a period setting and the fact that he actually tells his story mostly in sequential order, but manages to keep the viewer riveted to the screen completely to an extremely satisfying conclusion.Set in pre-Civil War Texas, the story follows a dentist turned bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who purchases a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx), ensuring his freedom in exchange for his help in getting to his former employers, who are Schultz' latest bounty. This leads to a partnership where Schultz trains Django in the art of bounty hunting and eventually agrees to help Django retrieve his wife(Kerry Washington), who is still the slave of a wealthy plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is obsessed with Mandingo slaves, slaves who are purchased in order to fight each other to the death purely for the white man's entertainment.In addition to the unaccustomed period setting for Tarantino, this film even took a politically sensitive subject like slavery and put a twist on it by providing an insightful look into the difference between the slave and the black man who wasn't a slave. It was rather unsettling to see Django not really interested in helping the slaves he encounters and the resentment that the slaves seem to have for a black man who is actually free which, sadly, rang true. And even though the film does have a period setting, it does provide the accustomed losers, wannabes, and scumbags that we expect from a Tarantino movie.As always, Tarantino's casting is on the money, led by Waltz, who won his second Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his charismatic and strikingly original King Schultz, Foxx's quiet intensity as the title character and DiCaprio, who has rarely been better in a very unsympathetic role. Mention should also be made of Samuel L. Jackson, who scores as DiCaprio's house man, a character you like one minute and hate the next. All of the actors somehow tap into the tongue in cheek aspect of Tarantino's Oscar winning screenplay in a way that keep the viewer riveted to the screen and not feeling the film's near three- hour length at all.Tarantino's direction is just as compelling as his screenplay. His eye for cinematic carnage is startling...there is some inventive camera work here that includes a unique use of slow motion and the art of the zoom. His offbeat song score simultaneously conjures images of Sergio Leone and Tupac Shakur.Tarantino fans should eat this up and for those who are not, you might want to consider this slightly more traditional story, told with the accustomed Tarantino cinematic panache, that is right up there with Scorsese.",8,0,1,14 March 2016
School of Rock," Jack Black is the whole show here and that's OK
","Jack Black had one of the best roles of his somewhat questionable career in 2003's School of Rock an entertaining comedy that provides pretty consistent laughs in addition to a moment of genuine warmth here and there.Black plays Dewey Finn, a homeless and penniless wanna be rock star who is crashing at his best friend's apartment, who one day takes a phone call, meant for his friend, accepting a position as a substitute teacher at a local grade school. Bored with teaching history, Dewey takes it upon himself to form a rock band out of the students in the classroom, on the DL, without the school's principal (Joan Cusack) finding out.Black found a role that fits him like a glove here. He is completely and naturally hilarious as Finn not only teaches the kids rock music but tries to educate them about the history of rock music as well. It's fun as we get to watch Finn bring some students out of their shell musically and put other students' egos in check as well as getting the tightly wound principal to lighten up as well.Richard Linklater's energetic direction, along with the performances of Black and Cusack that are the primary selling points here, not to mention Black's effortless charisma with the children that makes this film definitely worth checking out.",7,1,1,12 March 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Fincher's Directorial Triumph
","Director David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB)has achieved the zenith of his career with THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, a sweeping and majestic fable that spans almost an entire century. This moving and eloquent story follows the life of a boy named Benjamin, who was born as a baby in his late 80's and ages in reverse. His mother died in childbirth and his father was so horrified at the sight of him that he left him on an anonymous doorstep, where he was taken in by a kindly black owner of a boarding house in post WWI New Orleans. We become completely enveloped in Benjamin's tale as we watch him calmly accept the extraordinary hand that God has dealt him while others do the same or run in terror. We watch the kindly adopted mother who accepts his as he is, though does take him to a faith healer thinking she can 'save' him; we also watch his biological father track him down and regret his decision of giving the boy up while he maintains a life long friendship with Daisy, the little girl who he meets as an old manchild, whose lives meet in the middle as she grows into a vain beauty who can't accept the fact that Benjamin grows younger as she grows older. The film is visually arresting and bold in its cinematic scope as Fincher's meticulous direction brings you a story that should make you ponder, but really only makes you behold. Brad Pitt received his second Oscar nomination for his performance in the title role, a role which many feel was all visual effects and makeup; however, Benjamin has a mind and a soul and a voice that Pitt brings to this extraordinary character with a quiet and understated dignity. Cate Blanchett is luminous as Daisy, the love of Benjamin's life who can't quite accept Benjamin's life for what it is and there is strong support from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother and Jason Flemyng as his biological father. Fincher breathes an extraordinary life into this story which could have been buried in visual effects and makeup but has a life of its own and the final act as Daisy becomes an older woman while Benjamin regresses to infancy, is absolutely heartbreaking. A one of kind cinematic experience.",8,1,2,20 July 2013
Caddyshack," A raunchy comic classic that still generates laughs
","The primary story here is about a young caddy named Danny Noonan, played by Michael O'Keefe, who wants to win the Caddy Tournament, so that he can have enough money to go to college. Along the way, we meet Danny's mentor, the demented Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), a professional golfer who really doesn't give a damn about golf, if the truth be told, Judge Smalls (Ted Knight), the tightly wound president of the Country Club who finds himself in a battle of wills with one Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), a rich slob who wreaks havoc at the club and makes an instant enemy out of Smails and Carl (Bill Murray), a nutty grounds keeper who finds himself in battle with one wild gopher who is digging holes all over the golf course.This movie provides non-stop laughs from start to finish and features a soundtrack that is a dream to lovers of music from the late 1970's. Dangerfield and Murray provide the lion's share of the laughs here and, if the truth be told, Ted Knight has never been seen to better advantage. A comedy classic that just gets funnier with age.",8,0,2,6 March 2015
The Hangover Part II," If you liked the first one...
","This time around, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Alan (Zach Galifianakis), and Doug (Justin Bartha) actually fly all the way to Thailand where Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married. Still stinging from their Vegas adventure, Stu decides to have his bachelor party at an IHOP; unfortunately, it doesn't turn out that way. Just like the first movie, we see the guys raise their glasses and then we see them after another party. This time, Phil and Alan are on the floor, Alan's hair is gone, and Ed is passed out in the bathtub with a tattoo on his face. Oh, and Stu's 16-year old future brother-in-law is missing.Clearly, director and co-writer Todd Phillips was given a lot bigger budget this time around and the money can be seen on the screen. Beautiful Thailand locations are a plus, but the whole thing could have just as well have taken place in Vegas. This story would have worked in Vegas or Manhattan or anywhere local...I guess the idea of bringing the boys to Thailand was supposed to make the proceedings more substantial, but it still seems to be much to do about nothing.The actors still work well together, with standout work from Helms and Galifianakis and there's a scene stealing turn from a cigarette smoking monkey, and Ken Jeong's character redefines the word annoying, but if you liked the first film, you will probably like this one too.",6,0,0,16 April 2015
Toy Story," Sparkling family entertainment
","Disney/Pixar initiated a new sophisticated form of animation with the 1995 box office smash Toy Story, a richly entertaining and imaginative animated adventure that not only spawned two sequels, but became a merchandising dream.The film opens in the bedroom of a little boy named Andy who is moving in a couple of days. The central characters are Andy's toys, who are led by a cowboy action figure named Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), who is apparently Andy's favorite toy. Woody and the other toys feel seriously threatened when Andy receives a space action figure called Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) for his birthday. Immediate antagonism materializes between Woody and Buzz when Woody feels he might be replaced in Andy's heart, but Woody and Buzz are forced to bond and actually become friends when they become prisoners of Andy's next door neighbor, Sid, a sadistic little kid who likes to torture toys.This deliciously imaginative story works thanks to a brilliant screenplay that brings vivid and believable emotions to toys, effectively showcasing the world from a toy's point of view. The jealousy and resentment between Woody and Buzz rings completely true and is actually the glue that keeps this story moving. Though the story provides consistent laughs, there are a couple of poignant moments as well...watch when Andy stops sleeping with Woody, who gets demoted from Andy's bed to the toy box or watch when Buzz sees a commercial for himself and finally realizes that he is a toy and is not real.As always with Disney animated films, the voice casting is perfection, with standout work from Hanks, whose work here rivals the voice work of Robin Williams in Aladdin...he makes us love and care for Woody and puts us in his corner from jump. Mention should also be made of Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Jim Varney as the Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as a very insecure toy dinosaur, John Ratzenberger as a piggy bank named Ham, and R. Lee Ermey as a toy soldier. Really liked Annie Potts as a Little Bo Peep doll too, though I just couldn't get past my trouble with the fact that a little boy would own a Little Bo Peep doll, but I did not allow this to deter my enjoyment here.Randy Newman contributed a couple of nice songs to the film, one of which, 'You've Got a Friend', received an Oscar nomination. John Lasseter's direction and his contribution to the Oscar nominated screenplay are the final touches to this entertaining adventure that actually conjured up images of Spielberg work like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future, and though the story does have a couple of extra endings, it is a richly entertaining fantasy adventure that had me laughing and smiling throughout the entire running time.",8,0,1,16 December 2015
The Graduate," A smart and sexy classic
","The Graduate was the 1967 instant classic that won Mike Nichols a Best Director Oscar despite In the Heat of the Night winning Best Picture that year, and made an instant movie star out of its virtually unknown star, Dustin Hoffman.Hoffman plays Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate who has returned home with no real goals or aspirations and, as it turns out, doesn't have really time to think about such matters as he tentatively begins an affair with the much older wife of one of his parents friends, a Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), who pretty much bulldozes Benjamin into having sex with her and then flips out when Benjamin develops actual feelings for Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine (Katherine Ross).Buck Henry's clever and adult screenplay is deftly mounted by Nichols, whose directorial style is evidenced throughout...that shot of Benjamin telling Mrs. Robinson that she's trying to seduce him, from between Mrs. Robinson's legs, is sheer genius and could have come from no place but the creative mind of Mike Nichols.As most film buffs know, the role of Mrs. Robinson was originally offered to Doris Day, who turned the role down as she felt the screenplay was, in her word, 'vulgar.' The character definitely would have been something different played by Day, but I think Bancroft is perfection in the role and I can't imagine anyone else playing Mrs. Robinson and her on screen chemistry with newcomer Hoffman is surprisingly smooth.Bancroft and Hoffman receive solid support from William Daniels and Elizabeth Wilson as Benjamin's parents and Murray Hamilton as Mr. Robinson. There are also brief appearances from Norman Fell, Richard Dreyfuss, Mike Farrell, and the film's writer, Buck Henry. The now iconic song score by Simon and Garfunkle, including 'Mrs. Robinson' and 'The Sounds of SIlence' is also a big plus and perfectly compliments the on screen proceedings. A cinema classic that should be experience by all film purists. The film was turned into a stage play decades later with Kathleen Turner playing Mrs. Robinson.",9,0,0,12 March 2015
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," If you liked the original, you'll like this too.
","Home Alone 2: Alone in New York is the 1992 sequel to Home Alone which, like the original film, forces the viewer to accept a lot, but if you can, the film stands up proudly to its predecessor, a rarity for sequels.Once again, the McCallister family is going away for Christmas and this time they are headed to Paris. Somehow, the entire family manages to get on the plane without Kevin, who somehow ends up on a plane to New York. We then follow Kevin checking into New York's most expensive hotel and actually being reunited with the the bungling hoods (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who tormented him in the first film.If you can accept the fact that the McCallisters would allow that plane to Paris to take off without a head count and you can accept the fact that the Plaza Hotel would allow a child to check in by himself and don't question him being in possession of so much cash and credit, and you can accept the fact that these two idiot thieves actually somehow put together enough money to afford a trip to New York so that they can rob FAO Schwartz, there is fun to be had here.Director Chris Columbus and screenwriter John Hughes have mounted a viable sequel that is served well by its cast. Macaulay Culkin is just as slick and funny as he was in the first film. It doesn't hurt that the screenplay paints Kevin as the smartest character in the movie. There are some funny turns by Rob Schneider as a bellman, Dana Ivey as a snooty desk clerk, Eddie Bracken as the manager at FAO Schwartz and especially Tim Curry as the Concierge, who is onto Kevin and spends the entire running time trying to prove that the child is at the hotel alone and that his parents are not on the way. A bouquet as well to Catherine O'Hara, who is just wonderful here as Kate McCallister, whose overwhelming guilt about leaving her son behind again has her tearing the island of Manhattan apart looking for her son.If you liked the first movie, liking this one will not be a stretch.",7,0,1,14 April 2015
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," An Instant Classic
","The 1975 instant classic One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a blistering and intense comedy-drama that was the first film since 1934's It Happened One Night to sweep the top six major Oscars.This film, based on a novel and play by Ken Kesey, is the story of one Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a career criminal who has been given the option of going to jail or going to a mental institution and his swift and immediate battle of wills with the institution's iron- fisted head nurse, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who he challenges at every turn, not to mention his Pied Piper effect on his fellow patients, which doesn't help endear him to Nurse Ratched either.Kirk Douglas starred in the play on Broadway and his son, Michael Douglas, won an Oscar as one of the producers of this film. Milos Foreman's meticulous direction also won him an Oscar, but it is the electrifying performance by Jack Nicholson that, after four previous nominations, finally nabbed him an Oscar, as he created a truly original character in McMurphy who is a consistent enigma throughout the film, specifically in the sense of whether or not McMurphy is really mentally defective. Nicholson presents a character that allows us to ponder throughout without never being richly entertained for every moment he is on screen. McMurphy induces cheers when he gets overruled to watch the World Series on TV and he pretends to watch the game on TV anyway without turning it on...there is such a joy in watching the other inmates figuring out what he's doing and joining in the game. His final climactic confrontation with Nurse Ratched also will induce cheers.Louise Fletcher won the Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actress for her bone- chilling performance as Nurse Ratched. Fletcher beautifully underplays this extremely unsympathetic character, never resorting to scenery- chewing histrionics, but never forgetting that Ratched is clearly the villain of this piece. It's sad that Flecther's career did a swift downhill after this film because it's a masterful performance of such subtlety and delicacy. Meryl Streep is the only other actress I can think of who could have pulled this role off.Brad Dourif was robbed of one of the few Oscars the film didn't win, Best Supporting Actor, for his moving and riveting performance as Billy Bibbit, the soulful, stuttering manchild with mother issues whose hero worship of McMurphy helps him to develop some backbone up to a point. Mention should also be made of the performances of William Redfield, Danney De Vito, Vincent Schiavelli as fellow patients and especially Will Sampson as the quiet giant Chief Bromden, on whom McMurphy has a remarkable effect.A one of a kind motion picture experience with one of the most beautifully optimistic endings I can recall in a motion picture. 9/10",9,7,9,8 March 2015
Con Air," A Great Popcorn Movie
","Another one of my favorite popcorn movies was the 1997 action adventure Con Air, a non-stop thriller that moves from jail to the desert to the air to Las Vegas, never allowing the viewer to take a breath.The film stars Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe, a former US Ranger who has just been released from prison, who is being sent home via a plane filled with some of the worst criminal offenders on the planet, who finds himself in jeopardy when the criminals actually hijack the plane, thanks to a criminal mastermind named Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich) and how Poe ends up being a very reluctant hero.Director Simon West displays a real flare for the action drama and has given us a very likable hero in Cameron Poe (despite a questionable southern accent). Malkovich brilliantly walks the line between funny and menacing as Cyrus and John Cusack brings his flip screen charisma to the role of Vincent Larkin, a US marshall in charge of the plane. Ving Rhames, MC Gainey, Nick Chinlund, Mykel T Williamson, and Rachel Ticotin offer solid support to one of the most enjoyable action flicks of the 1990's...just hold onto something and watch.",7,4,5,3 March 2015
The Blind Side," Overrated but Watchable
","he Blind Side is the 2009 biographical drama that examines the relationship between a wealthy socialite named Leigh Ann Tuohy and a homeless teenager named Michael Oher, who would eventually go on to a successful career in college football and eventually would be the 2009 round one draft pick by the Baltimore Ravens. The film is supposed to be about the relationship between these two central characters; however, their relationship is not the primary focus of the film, as it should be, which is the main reason the film doesn't really work as it should.Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for Outstanding Lead Actress for her performance as Leigh Ann, a strong-willed matriarch with a heart as big as all outdoors who sees Michael walking on a deserted road in the rain one night and, upon learning he has no place to stay, decides to take him in and it is the slow burn of the relationship between Leigh Ann and Michael that is supposed to be the heart of this story; unfortunately, I found the relationship that develops between Michael and Leigh Ann's son, SJ, a lot more compelling than his relationship with Leigh Ann.I also think the film loses points for trying to encompass a little too much. The film begins to veer off track as we watch Leigh Ann being mocked by her high society girlfriends and watch Michael being tracked down by the NAACP when Leigh Ann's motives for helping Michael come into question. Writer director John Lee Hancock should have kept the focus of his screenplay where it seems to belong...on Leigh Ann's dedication to helping Michael carve out a new life for himself via a career in college football. Despite the fact that the basis of her inspiration for him lies in some kind of test he took where he allegedly made high scores in the category of 'protective instincts.' I went to high school and college and don't remember ever having taken any kind of test regarding 'protective instincts', though it does provide the impetus for one of Bullock's best moments in the film, where she interrupts Michael's troublesome football practice by offering familial analogies to help Michael do what he has to do on that field.The fact that this story is based on real people and events also had me questioning certain parts of the story and their credibility, which easily could have been glossed over or altered for the sake of a more entertaining story. I find it a little hard to believe that Leigh Ann's husband and family were so immediately accepting of Leigh Ann's decision to bring this stranger into their home. I also found it troubling that before beginning proceedings to become Michael's legal guardian that Leigh Ann actually went to Michael's crack-addicted mother to let the woman know what her plans were and the fact that Leigh Ann wasn't troubled by the fact that the woman wasn't terribly upset by the news was also troubling.Sandra Bullock gives a solid performance as Leigh Ann and I understand to a point why she won the Oscar...it was her turn I guess, but personally, I think Bullock has done better work. For the record though, I LOVE Bullock as a blonde. Country singer Tim McGraw charms as Leigh Ann's wealthy husband, who just seems to go along with everything Leigh Ann wants a little too easily and I find it hard to believe that the real Sean Tuohy was as easy going about this whole thing as the character in the movie is. Quinton Aaron is refreshingly natural as Michael as is Jae Head as young SJ. Mention should also be made of a very entertaining performance by Ray McKinnon as Michael's high school football coach, who is initially baffled by Michael but loved taking credit for everything he did.John Lee Hancock had a very Oscar-baity story here that he is only partially successful in presenting. Despite problems in story construction and improper focus on character relationships, the film is worth checking out, but it is not everything that it has been made out to be.",6,2,2,19 March 2015
The Queen," An Intimate Story told on a Grand Scale
","Helen Mirren's complex and mesmerizing Oscar-winning performance anchors THE QUEEN, an intimate story told on a grand scale, documenting, in what could only be a blend of fact and speculation, the movements of the royal family, Queen Elizabeth II in particular, during the days following Princess Diana's death. Peter Morgan's uncompromising screenplay hypothesizes much of the Queen's thoughts and emotions during this difficult period as this story takes us into extremely private moments with the conflicted monarch of which no one could be privy, but basically, this story portrays the Queen as an icy and cold-hearted harridan who is curiously unmoved by Diana's death and does nothing to publicly grieve or acknowledge the Princess, who by this time, was already divorced from Prince Charles and had basically turned her back on the Royal family. The film shows how Englanders' begin to publicly air their resentment of the Queen for her actions, or lack thereof, and her battle of wills with Prime Minister Tony Blair, who tirelessly advocated that the Queen acknowledge Diana publicly and what she had come to mean to the rest of the world as 'the People's Princess.' Stephen Frears' bold direction does not sugar coat the screenplay, which doesn't necessarily paint the title figure in a flattering light, but puts a human face on this mysterious icon. Mirren's delicately nuanced performance is breathtaking and Michael Sheen (FROST/NIXON)proves to be a formidable screen presence in his interpretation of Tony Blair. Mention should also be made of James Cromwell as Prince Phillip and Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother, who also make the most of their screen time, but it is the bold screenplay and Mirren's artistry that make this film sing.",6,0,1,2 March 2015
Bruce Almighty," Carrey has definitely done better work
","Jim Carrey's comic charisma almost makes 2003's Bruce Almighty sitting through...almost. But if you're a hardcore Carrey fan, your tolerance of this film could be a little higher.Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a TV anchorman who feels that everything in his life is turning to crap, triggered by the loss of a promotion to an obnoxious co-worker (Steve Carell), who starts being very vocal about the way God is ruining his life and that everything that has gone wrong in his life is because God is too busy to pay attention to him, which results in God (Morgan Freeman) appearing to Bruce and offering Bruce the challenge of running the world by transferring all of his powers to Bruce.Despite solid direction from Tom Shadyac, who also directed Carrey in Liar,Liar and Carrey's ability to make the most lame material funny, this film is about as predictable as they come, which includes Bruce's initial selfish use of the power he's been given, the abuse of the people in his life he cares about, and his eventual epiphany about how hard God's job really is.Carrey generates sporadic laughs, as does Steve Carrell as Evan Baxter, Carrey's obnoxious colleague and Nora Dunn as Carrey's boss, but Jennifer Aniston's role as Bruce's girlfriend, Grace, is thankless. The best thing about this movie is the classy presence of Morgan Freeman in the role of God. His performance alone makes this movie worth sitting through. The movie was followed up by Evan Almighty.",5,0,0,30 November 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," Emma Thompson really shines here...
","2013's Saving Mr. Banks is, for the most part, a deliciously entertaining fact-based story that blends a show business backstage story with a biography that works for the most part, even though the thread connecting the two stories might have been revealed a little sooner into the story. This film is a look at the mounting of the 1964 classic Mary Poppins and the battle of wills Walt Disney went through with the author of the books from which the character was taken, P L Travers, in order to secure the rights to the character in order to make the film, something he promised his daughters he would do. The film beautifully chronicles Disney's tireless efforts to make the film that he wants to make and how it is in complete and direct conflict with Travers' vision of the character.For those who are fans of Mary Poppins, this film will alternately fascinate and aggravate as we watch Mrs. Travers fight every single thing that Disney and his production team want to do to bring the character to the screen while simultaneously delivering flashbacks to Travers' childhood, which slowly reveal why Travers has so many issues with Disney's vision for the film.This film works very hard at connecting these two interesting stories which could have both made separate movies and frankly, I found the portion of the movie that focuses on Disney and Travers and their battles over the movie more interesting than the flashbacks to Travers' childhood, but the flashbacks do provide insight into why Travers was so unhappy with what Disney wanted to do with the film.Mary Poppins is my favorite movie of all time so I knew I was going to be on board with whatever I learned here, but I did find it odd that everything Travers is seen initially objecting to did end up on the screen. I do love the scene where she is introduced to the song 'Let's Go Fly a Kite', which was the beginning of Travers acceptance of the film because it spoke to the root of her problem with the screenplay.Tom Hanks brings a lovely warmth to the role of Walt Disney that reveals his complete understanding of the man, but it is the crisp and articulate performance by Emma Thompson as the tightly wound P L Travers that really makes this film work...we don't understand why Travers is so inflexible regarding the story, despite the fact that it is revealed in the opening scene that she is broke and really needs the money selling the rights would provide for her. Thompson is brilliant as we watch Travers bristle over 'Supercalifragilisticexpialadocious' or her complete inflexibility regarding the penguins being animated in the 'Jolly Holiday' scene, but Thompson really shines in the scene where Travers is watching the completed film at the premiere and how she completely nails the conflicted emotions Travers feels as she really wants to hate what she's watching but really can't deny that the audience around her is loving what they are seeing. And from what I have read, Travers did not like the film as much as she is depicted liking it here, but for this movie, I can forgive that.Mention should also be made of a lovely performance by Colin Farrell as Travers' father in the flashback scenes, as well as solid work from Bradley Whitford as Poppins screenwriter Don DiGradi, BJ Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers, who wrote the music for the film, and Paul Giamatti as Travers' driver, 'the only American she likes.'John Lee Hancock's detailed direction and the carefully structured screenplay are the finishing touches to this very special movie and if you're a Mary Poppins fan like me, this movie is appointment viewing.",8,1,1,29 November 2015
Speed," Just hang on and watch!
","One of the biggest hits of 1994 was the action thriller Speed, a thrill- a-minute film that provides edge-of-your-seat excitement from beginning to end.Jan De Bont, who also directed Twister proves to have a gift for mounting a contemporary action drama filled with very human and believable characters, not to mention some bold casting choices, one of the boldest was the casting of Keanu Reeves as a police detective who gets in the middle of a bizarre hostage situation when he learns that a psychopath from his past (Dennis Hopper) has planted a bomb on a bus that will explode if the bus slows to below 50 MPH.De Bont and screenwriter Graham Yost have mounted an intricate story that starts in one direction with our hero helping a group of people trapped in an elevator and all of a sudden heads into a completely different direction with a flawed protagonist whose guilt about his past with our villain puts him in full hero mode.Reeves, an actor of questionable talent prior to this film, makes more than a viable action hero here and Hopper is properly menacing as our bad guy. Sandra Bullock gives a star-making performance in one of her earliest performances as a bus passenger who, through bizarre circumstances, ends up driving the bus and keeping it at 50 MPH.This film provides riveting action and suspense from the beginning to the end, barely allowing the viewer to breathe as De Bont somehow tells this story on a pretty large canvas, yet gives us the claustrophobic feeling of being inside that bus at the same time. The film won four Oscars for its technical expertise and was followed by a forgettable sequel.",8,1,3,4 March 2015
Flight," Outstanding direction and a solid lead performance make this one work.
","Despite a preachy screenplay delivered with sledgehammer-like intensity on a well-worn cinematic subject, 2012's Flight is a riveting and emotionally manipulative drama that effectively showcases the horrors of addiction on a surprising canvas and delivers the goods, thanks to polished direction and a powerhouse lead performance as a very unlikable character.This uncompromising drama stars Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker (terrible character name), a veteran airline pilot who we meet the morning after an evening of sex, booze, and cocaine with a flight attendant who is glanced snorting a huge line of cocaine and then seen boarding a plane that he is actually scheduled to fly. After navigating the plane through some brief initial turbulence, Whitaker actually has another drink while assuring the 102 passengers aboard that everything is going to be all right. Whitaker then returns to the cockpit and the plane malfunctions and is forced to glide to an emergency crash landing. Thanks to Whitaker's expertise and experience as a pilot, the crash only produces six fatalities, four passengers and two flight attendants and Whitaker is initially proclaimed a hero until the toxicology report reveals that he was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine while flying, which could result in four charges of manslaughter and the rest of his life in prison.This film angers almost immediately because it seems like we are supposed to sympathize with Whitaker, but I found that impossible. What is made clear here is the denial, rationalization, and justification that goes through the mind of an alcoholic, but there is no excusing it here because Whitaker's actions resulted in the loss of life. It is further exacerbated by the fact that Whitaker knows he is wrong and and actually tries to cover up what he did. We watch in horror and disgust as Whitaker is released from the hospital, escapes to his family hideaway and spends hours throwing away all of the liquor that he has hidden in the house, a lengthy and effective scene filmed with a hand-held camera that shows the lengths an alcoholic will go to cover up what he's doing. We then watch Whitaker try to save his own ass when he realizes it is on the line by looking for crew members, including the co-pilot who may never walk again because of the crash, to have his back when they are asked to testify against him. Any sympathy the character might have evoked disappears during the scene where he asks the head flight attendant (Tamara Tunie) to lie for him.Director Robert Zemeckis has mounted a familiar story on a unique canvas that will make the viewer give pause for a myriad of reasons...watching Whitaker's story is properly disturbing as it makes us think twice, not only about drinking and drugging, but about ever boarding a plane again without seeing the pilot's toxicology report that an airline's attorney (Don Cheadle) actually tries to bury in an attempt to save Whitaker's undeserving ass, but even those actions turn out to be pointless and Whitaker eventually must suffer the consequences of his actions, which seems to be the underlying theme of this story, but the really disturbing aspect here is how long it takes for these consequences to surface and the deep denial of Whitaker's addiction.Zemeckis directs with a master hand again...the plane crash he presents here is as harrowing as the one he mounted in Cast Away. The shots of the plane completely inverted are dizzying and frightening. Washington completely invests in a completely unsympathetic character and delivers a performance of such power it merited him an Oscar nomination. Cheadle is solid as the attorney as are Bruce Greenwood and John Goodman as professional and personal allies of Whitaker and mention should also be made of Kelly Reilly as Nicole, a pathetic heroine junkie who becomes Whitaker's enabler up to a point. Yes, the message here is delivered with a sledgehammer but it works and the climax doesn't quite ring true considering what we have witnessed prior, but the denouement is somewhat satisfying as we do see Whitaker pay for his actions, though his alleged redemption implied near the ending is a bit much. Still a riveting film experience thanks to a harrowing story and one of our greatest actors delivering the goods.",7,2,3,16 December 2015
The Ugly Truth," Katherine Heigl sucks
","For those who wonder why Katherine Heigl's so-called movie career was such a bust might want to check out a tiresome 2009 comedy called The Ugly Truth.The title of the film is the title of a cable access show that takes the male outlook at relationships, hosted by a sexist and obnoxious guy named Mike (Gerard Butler) who has been hired to beef up the ratings of a Sacramento morning talk show and finds himself going head to head with the show's tightly-wound producer (Heigl).It was way too many so-called romantic comedies like this one that killed Heigl's film career. Filmmakers seem to have wanted Heigl to be sort of a contemporary Doris Day who men lust after but have to work REALLY hard at melting her icy exterior. Unfortunately, unlike Doris Day, Heigl's movie characters are usually bitchy and unlikable and you find yourself scratching your head trying to figure out what the leading man sees in her and this film is no exception.Nicole Eastman and Karen McCullah's screenplay is overly cute and director Robert Luketic tries to disguise this by having all the characters speak 100 MPH so that the viewer doesn't really notice how lame the story really is. Gerard Butler appears to be having a ball here, but that doesn't necessarily make it a great performance and his chemistry with Heigl is non-existent. There are a pair of funny supporting performances by John Michael Higgins and Cheryl Hines as the co-hosts of the show, who are also married off-screen, but unless you live for Butler or Heigl, I'd give this one a pass.",4,0,2,30 November 2015
The Breakfast Club," John Hughes' Classic Tale of Teen Angst
","Writer-director John Hughes continued his foray into teen angst comedy with the 1985 winner The Breakfast Club, a warm and winning look at five high school students trapped together in detention on a Saturday. We watch as these students get to know each other and eventually bond because during regular school hours, they pretty much navigate in separate orbits.Hughes' cinematic muse, Molly Ringwald plays Claire, a spoiled and popular princess who is in detention because she ditched class to go shopping. Claire spends the majority of detention fighting an attraction to John Bender (Judd Nelson), a thug who spends every Saturday in detention. Emilio Estevez plays Andy, a jock with father issues and Anthony Michael Hall plays Brian, a straight-A geek who seems to think being in detention is kind of cool. Ally Sheedy completes the quintet as Allison, a space cadet whose reason for being in detention is the funniest of them all.Despite a sort of music video directorial approach, Hughes screenplay compliments as we get to watch a bonding between these students occur, but not too quickly and pretty realistically.The performances are first rate, with standout work from Nelson and Hall. Mention should also be made of Paul Gleason, appropriately slimy as Mr. Vernon, the teacher supervising detention, who apparently has his own issues.This film was a box office smash and was pretty much an instant classic upon release. Teen angst has rarely been this much fun.",8,1,2,4 March 2015
Goodfellas," For my money, Martin Scorsese's Best Film
","Movies about the mob have been part of cinema history for decades, but never was life as a mobster made to look more glamorous and more alluring than it was presented in Martin Scorsese's 1990 masterpiece Goodfellas, a sweeping cinematic epic that spans several decades in the lives of a select group of men working their way up through the social strata of the syndicate.The film opens on the childhood of one Henry Hill (a real person BTW, who is now in the Witness Protection Program), a teen who started his career with the mob as an errand boy and was paid handsomely for his efforts. It's a little unsettling the way the mob draws Henry in and makes what he does seem so glamorous and exciting, but Nicholas Pileggi's screenplay brilliantly shines light on the allure of life in the mob. Even though we know it's wrong, the way the director and screenwriter make it completely understandable. There's something rather pathetic about the fact that when a teenage Henry is arrested for the first time, the fact that he keeps his mouth shut about his employers, makes him the new hero of this dangerous inner circle and that he will be protected by them for life.The inner circle includes a couple of career mobsters Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) who take the adult Henry (now played by Ray Liotta) under their wing and the sometimes conflicted emotions Henry goes through when he realizes some of the things that are required of him. The movie's opening is proof of this as we see Jimmy, Tommy, and Henry in a car with a body in a trunk which they are preparing to bury somewhere in New Jersey. Despite the rampant ugliness that is a part of this life, the perks seem to outweigh the ugliness for Henry until he is in so deep that he can't get out, to the point where his job has direct correlations to the Don, Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who treats Henry like a son until he learns that Henry has branched out into his own side business that has threatened the primary business and everyone involved.Scorcese has created a world that looks impossible to resist and it is very easy to understand how Hill got pulled in, and as we all know, once you're in, you never get out. Eventually, Henry was in so much trouble, his only alternative to being whacked was selling out.The cast is absolutely perfect, led by De Niro as Conway and a star- making performance by Ray Liotta as Henry Hill. Liotta is sexy and charismatic as Hill and no matter what Hill does, Liotta always makes the viewer sympathize with Henry, no matter what he's going through. Joe Pesci won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his outrageous performance as Tommy, which produces equal doses of laughs and chills, whether he is amusing cronies with wild stories, beating the crap out of old buddies, or borrowing a shovel from his clueless mom to help bury a body in the trunk of his car while he is at mom's dinner table eating pasta. Lorraine Braco received a supporting actress nomination for her fiery performance as Karen, Henry's wife who turns a blind eye to what her husband is doing because the perks for her seem to be even better than the perks Henry gets. Paul Sorvino commands the screen as Big Paulie and Catherine Scorsese (the director's mother) is adorable as Tommy's mother.Scorsese's cinematic eye for violence and shock is in full view here, creating a glamorous look at mob life that doesn't minimize the violence and ugliness that comes along with it. The art direction and divine musical score also deserve mention here. The film and Scorsese were both robbed of Oscars...in a word, a masterpiece.",9,0,0,6 March 2015
The Birds," This movie gave me nightmares (My favorite Hitchcock)
","Though it's not considered one of his masterpieces, 1963's The Birds is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, a film that not only provides genuine scares, but is a master class in the art of cinematic suspense.Based on a short story by Daphne Du Maurier, this is the story of a wealthy socialite from San Francisco named Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who travels to a small Northern Californian town called Bodega Bay to pursue a possible relationship with the town's most eligible bachelor, Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and, upon her arrival, a series of unmotivated attacks by birds end up terrorizing the entire town.Other than the technical mastery and animal training that had to be involved in getting these birds to do what they were supposed to do when they are supposed to do it, this film shows what a master Hitchcock was at building suspense...watch the scene where Melanie is sitting on a bench smoking a cigarette while birds begin gathering on a jungle gym behind her or the scene before the final attack where Melanie, Mitch, his mother, and kid sister are sitting in the front room of the Brenner home waiting for a bird attack on the house. The suspense created in these scenes will have you either holding your breath or screaming at the screen for the characters to wake up.The wooden performances, especially Hedren, are irrelevant to the artistry that is Hitchcock that makes this classic a film that gave me nightmares for months and to this day, I still get very nervous when I see 3 or more birds gather in one location.",8,1,3,7 March 2015
The Soloist," An effective drama that sacrifices a little too much realism for the drama.
","A compelling, fact-based story and a couple of powerhouse starring performances ignite The Soloist, a 2009 drama which attempts to put a human face on some hot-button issues, but, at times, seems to sacrifice the reality of the situations presented here for dramatic effect.The film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Steve Lopez, a writer for the LA Times, who happens upon a homeless man playing the violin and after a tentative encounter, learns that the man is named Nathaniel Ayers and spent 2 years studying the cello at Julliard, but did not graduate. Lopez finds himself drawn to the man, not to mention deciding that his story would make great material for his paper, but struggles to connect with the man, whose obvious mental health issues make it very difficult for Lopez to help the man, despite the fact that the series of articles he has written about Nathaniel are garnering attention and acclaim for him.The film is an emotionally charged look at Lopez' tireless obsession with making a personal connection with this gifted musician whose life went astray at some point and his frustration with the fact that he is powerless to help Nathaniel in the way that he needs the most help...help with his mental issues, that from what we've been shown, could be anything from autism to schizophrenia. The problem is that like a lot of people with serious mental issues, they are unaware that they have mental health issues and as long as they are not a danger to themselves or others, they cannot be forced into psychiatric treatment or medication that could help them and this is an issue that this story completely nails. Lopez' desire to help Nathaniel is the core of this story and the fact that he is powerless in securing this kind of help for the man, it doesn't matter that he actually finds the man a place to live or even gets his talent as a musician recognized, as long as his mental issues aren't properly addressed, he can never be a whole person again, something Lopez has difficulty accepting.Flashback sequences provide a peek into Nathaniel's past and we do see the beginning of his mental decay during an orchestra rehearsal where Nathaniel starts to hear voices in his head, but we are provided no further insight into the man's mental decay, which I found kind of aggravating.There is also a scene where a worn out Lopez appears to be giving up on Nathaniel and Nathaniel's response is to start asking Lopez personal questions about his own life, which just rang totally false to me...most mentally challenged people are in their own world and not prone to reaching out to others. I also had a problem with the idea of arranging for Nathan to actually give a recital. I had a hard time believing that Nathaniel would agree to such a thing but his reaction to being onstage legitimized that.What does ring true though is Jamie Foxx's brilliant performance as Nathaniel, which totally nails the character's delicate mental sensibilities...the way he constantly talks and you think he's not listening at all, but he does catch things here and there and the way he remembers everything he learned about Lopez during their first meeting when they meet for the second time, an ability which made me think there might be some facet of autism involved in Nathaniel's condition. He's in his own world but certain facts do register and lodge in his memory banks without ever exiting his personal mental orbit of which he is a virtual prisoner.Robert Downey Jr. matches Foxx note for note with a vivid performance that is so human that you almost don't see him acting. The performance is also a wonderful acting study in reaction and playing off the actions of another actor. Watch him when he takes the cello out of Nathaniel's arms that he received as an anonymous gift for Nathaniel or when Nathaniel gets physical with him at the end of the film. Robert Downey Jr. doesn't make a false move here and it is easy to overlook his work in the midst of Foxx's flash. I have a feeling that a lot of the direct communication between Lopez and Nathaniel was enhanced through Susannah Grant's screenplay for heightened drama rather than realism. Communicating with the mental ill, especially those with schizophrenia or autism, is a lot more difficult than depicted here. Bouquets to Catherine Keener and Lisa Gay Hamilton for bringing substance to the thankless roles of Lopez' editor/ex-wife and Nathaniel's sister, respectively. This film is a sobering indictment on the plight of the homeless and the mentally ill that even though slightly-over dramatized, pushes a lot of hot buttons and will definitely gnaw at your emotions.",8,0,0,10 April 2015
Dodgeball," Funny movie with likable characters
","Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is a fast-paced and very funny sports comedy that scores points for being centered around a sport that hasn't been the subject of too many movies.The movie stars Vince Vaughn playing one of his most likable characters, Peter LaFleur, the owner of a gym that is about to go under who puts together a rag-tag team of misfits to participate in a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas in order to win the large cash prize.Prior to this movie, I had no idea that dodgeball was a team sport that has Olympic-like rules, displayed here In a hilarious training film that Peter shows his team. This premise sets up a classic Revenge of the Nerds-esque confrontation between Peter's team and a team from a rival gym that wants to buy Peter out, owned by the arrogant White Goodman (Ben Stiller).A romantic triangle is also set up with the presence of an accountant who has been hired to help Peter, but White ends up trying to pursue her as well. Ironically, this role is played by Ben Stiller's real-life spouse, Christine Taylor, who first caught our eye as Marcia in the two Brady Bunch movies.Vaughn is actually the straight man here to Stiller, who is hysterically funny here, as are Stephen Root, Chris Williams, and Alan Tudyk as members of Peter's team, Missi Pyle as a beast from White's team, Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as color commentators at the tournament, and especially Rip Torn as Patches Houlihan, the alleged Dodgeball legend who agrees to help coach Peter's team.Funny dialogue, music video-paced direction and cast that aims to please help to make this comedy worth checking out.",7,0,1,10 April 2015
Law Abiding Citizen," Watchable despite some serious stretching of credibility
","2009's Law Abiding Citizen is an emotionally manipulative and shockingly violent crime thriller that takes films like Death Wish to a whole new level.Clyde Shelton's wife and daughter were brutally murdered by a pair of home intruders and one of the killers managed a plea bargain which got him a lighter sentence in exchange for turning on his partner. Shelton, still numbed from his family's death, has his own plan on making sure the other killer gets what he deserves. Unfortunately, this is only the beginning of Shelton's revenge as he plans to punish the entire justice system through the elimination of anyone and everyone involved in the outcome of his case.Gerard Butler works very hard at infusing the character of Clyde Shelton with sympathy, but he gets no help from Kurt Rimmer's screenplay, who turns the grief-stricken Shelton into a mustache twirling, one- dimensional villain. Jamie Foxx is quietly effective as the assistant district attorney on Shelton's case who brokered the deal that got one of the killers free. I was impressed that despite everything Shelton puts Foxx's Nick Rice through, he makes it clear that he does not regret his decision to broker the plea bargain because if they had gone to trial, both killers might have gone free.Bruce McGill, Leslie Bibb, Regina Hall, and Colm Meaney score in supporting roles and there is a classy turn from Viola Davis as the Mayor. The film is filled with shocking, over-the-top violence that definitely makes this film for adults and the screenplay is a little talky, dragging it down in spots, but director F. Gary Gray keeps things moving at a nice pace for the most part and if you can accept Butler's channeling of Mel Gibson and some of the things that Shelton is able to do from inside a jail cell, it's a pretty entertaining ride.",7,0,1,16 April 2015
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Farrell and Company Strike gold again
","Will Ferrell and his growing rep company provide some of their biggest laughs ever in TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE LEGEND OF RICKY BOBBY, another of Ferrell's sports-oriented comedies that takes a popular American sport and turns it on its ears.Ferrell plays the title character, an arrogant and dim-witted stock car driver, whose winning philosophy was based on something his father said to him as a child, whose life is altered forever when he has a serious accident and after a lengthy rehab, tries to resume his life and learns that his best friend has moved in with his wife and kids, taken over his career, and has to depend on his long lost father to take his life back. Ferrell and Adam McKay have concocted one of the smartest and funniest screenplays in comedy history which takes effective pot shots at the stock car driving industry as well as the advertising industry as well. McKay's energized direction is also a big plus, but its Ferrell and his winning cast that really make this one shine.Ferrell is hysterical, as always, and gets solid comic support from the always reliable John C. Reilly as Cal Naughton, Ricky's best friend who finally takes advantage of his chance to move out of Ricky's shadow, Leslie Bibb as Ricky's gold-digging wife, David Keocher and Michael Clarke Duncan as members of Ricky's pit crew, Jane Lynch as Ricky's mom, and in a performance that comes as close as I have seen anyone to steal a movie from Will Ferrell, Gary Cole as Ricky's derelict Dad, whose training sessions to get Ricky back on the track are hysterical. Sasha Baron Cohen provides some giggles as well in a sexually androgynous variation of his BORAT character.The film provides solid laughs from beginning to end, especially for Ferrell fans.
