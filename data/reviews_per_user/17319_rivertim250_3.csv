Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A mix of 'Barney in Space' and 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'
","To tell the truth, this didn't fell like a STAR WARS movie nor a George Lucas movie. It felt more like a mix of 'Barney in Space' and Tim Burton's CHARLIE IN THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY! What happened? What made George Lucas slip? Maybe it was because of the Ewoks in RETURN OF THE JEDI! Curse you, Ewoks! Anyway, by far the worst film in the series! The only good part of the film was the good acting from Liam Neeson! And then they had Neeson play second fiddle to some kid named Jake Lloyd! I think the film SHOULD HAVE BEEN focused on the characters of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, and I think the storyline should have been about them hiding Queen Padme in a hidden fortress or something on Naboo! The podracer shmick and the adults putting their lives in the hands of a kid is the same as having Batman save Gotham from the clutches of the muppet Miss Piggy! WHOAH! Good day!",1,1,3,1 September 2006
X-Men," One of the best Marvel epics
","X-MEN was the ultimate blockbuster debut film for Bryan Singer. It had something the superhero films of the past (Christopher Reeve's Superman films and the Tim Burton/Joel Schumahcer Batman film line) were lacking: a heart and soul, marvelous visual effects, and a terrific cast! Patrick Stewart, the LEADING MAN of the film, was the perfect choice for a character like Xavier! I fell in love with his performance. Ian McKellen is great as Magneto as well! McKellen makes Magneto not a comic book character, but a misunderstood being hardened by events of the past. Hugh Jackman was a great casting choice for Wolverine. The rest of the cast are superb as well. Bravo, Bryan Singer, and bravo Patrick Stewart!",10,0,0,1 September 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," An Irvin Kershner film based on George Lucas's characters
","Indeed, this is the best film in the original STAR WARS trilogy, but it is not really a George Lucas film, but rather an Irvin Kershner film based on George Lucas characters. Irvin Kershner proves that he is a master at telling someone else's story, yet having time to give his own contributions-- a darker tone, a higher level of character development, and a sense of professionalism. While we must still credit George Lucas for helping with Yoda and the visual effects, Irvin Kerhsner has the highest credit for bringing this story to life! Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriters, creates a screenplay with a darker tone, which in turn gives more depth to Luke Skywalker and other characters. By far the best film of 1980! Bravo, Irvin Kershner!",10,1,2,1 September 2006
