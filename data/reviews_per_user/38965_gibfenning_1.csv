Ford v Ferrari," Another Movie That Got Ripped OFF at The AA
","When I was in design school, my professors always reminded me that it was much easier to do a campaign for a condom company than a fence-building company. Thanks Susan. That is true. F V F is a fence company - a movie about cars and racing cars. But, this is a great, well made, creative masterpiece. It never gets corny or starchy. Granted - some of the periphery characters are caricatures, but, the main characters on which we focus feel real and not put on.
In contrast to some of the Oscar pics that seem more like rewards for towing the line rather than artistic achievements, it's good to have a movie that you can watch from start to end w/o questioning what you're watching and still get completely caught-up in it. I loved JoJo Rabbit almost as much (that took a lot from Wes Anderson - a favorite), but a good straight-forward, well written, un-cringy movie like F v F should still be an AA favorite.",Null,1,1,6 April 2020
