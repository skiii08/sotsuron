Sucker Punch," Great Film, well worth the $15 i paid for it
","In my opinion the movie was a good movie. It bugs me to read reviews and have people complaining because it 'looks too much like a video game' or 'there was no real suspense' well thats not even the point. The girls cant be hurt when there inside baby dolls dream worlds because its all in her head, and baby doll chooses to be strong. In reality they are 5 girls locked in an asylum with no control over what they can do, but the reason for it changing to a club and baby doll making up these grand stories is because she doesn't want to feel weak or dependent, inside her mind shes strong, courageous and able to stand up for herself along with her companions.Maybe im reading too much into it but its a movie about escaping reality and going to a better place, a place that you can control and that you can be or do whatever you want so maybe thats the point. The end was a bit disappointing because it left us wondering what happens to 'blue' but again in my opinion thats part of it, its left to the audience to decide what happens. Is baby doll finally at peace in her own mind? does blue pay for what he did? how does sweet pea's life play out now? its all left to the viewer who gets to (just like in the movie) be creative and decide what happens. The movie was action packed, filled with good looking girls and leaves a good message behind. 'You have all the weapons you need, now fight'",10,34,60,12 September 2011
Yes Man," Amazing movie!
","Personally i loved the movie, jim carey of course is a riot and its just a really good story line. I feel like anyone suffering from depression or just having a bad day can watch this, smile and make the change necessary in their life to make themselves happy again i know thats what i did.The message was brought in a very clear and understanding way with some laughs and moments that tug your heart strings along the way i gave this movie a 10/10 because its a very big inspirational film that can also make you laugh, cause no one likes a boring video thats supposed to help. WEll worth the $20 i paid for it.",Null,1,1,16 September 2011
Shutter Island," One word: Amazing
","Not only does the movie have you guessing and figuring things out then entire time but its got action, suspense and at some points it'll make you jump. The actors did an amazing job playing their roles and the film was pieced together perfectly. A very satisfying mystery movie FINALLY! I've seen the movie about 5 times and i still love watching it, takes alittle while to figure it all out. I would happily recommend this movie to anyone (maybe not children there are swears) and tell you to buckle down and get ready to think because you'll be confused the entire time.",10,0,1,12 September 2011
