First Man," Fell asleep watching this boring movie.
","Like many others I found this movie wooden and boring. Way too much camera shaking, sparce dialogue. Like Ryan Gosling, I felt no emotion and even though this was one of the most important moments in the history of mankind I was so bored just kept hoping the movie would end.",3,3,5,21 January 2019
The Irishman," Too long and too slow...
","The movie was okay but I really felt for the length of time it ran more could have been to done to make you feel something for Robert De Niro's character 'Frank'. He appeared very wooden and flat although there was a bit with the daughter near the end. He seemed to go through the movie as just a robot who was told to go here and there 'taking care of things' like an errand boy even though he was inducted into the 'most powerful' inner circle with the gold coin ring. Over all the movie was too long and progressed too slowly. I ended up being impatient, hoping it would be over before the end.",5,3,5,1 January 2020
