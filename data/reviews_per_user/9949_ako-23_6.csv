"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Simon Pegg Stikes Again
","After the great Success of Shaun of the Dead(2004) and Hot Fuzz(2007) here comes another hilarious movie form Simon Pegg , but this time only as an actor . This movie was incredibly funny , and also a bit romantic , it talks about a lazy man whose fear of commitment leads him to runaway from his wedding and leave his pregnant Fiancée behind , an then five years later he tries to win her back by participating in a marathon to prove that he can finish something . I don't usually like these kind of movies but this movie is much superior and far greater than Romantic Comedies in the past century Although it's not too much romantic but still it's a great fun . Great movie .. Go see it and you will laugh your guts out .",7,5,11,17 March 2008
Gran Torino," Eastwood's latest masterpiece
","Over the past 5 decades Clint Eastwood has been an icon in film making , creating wonderful, entertaining films mostly with a greater ,deeper message .Starting from the great fun of the good the bad and the ugly as an actor , and a male icon , and ending with the world war II epic Letters from Iwo Jima as a tremendous director.Now at 78, and closing on 79, Clint successfully and brilliantly directed Gran Torino, his latest and one of his best films in the last two decades . Gran Torino , revolves around an old man Walter Kowalski who suffers with his life after the death of his longtime wife , Walt (the name he doesn't like to be called with) tries to make a man of a shy unsocial , and slightly disturbed Hmong teenager (Tao) who is indirectly forced to steal his Gran Torino by his gangster cousins.As always Eastwood almost perfectly directed the screenplay , which contains a balanced amount of comedy and tragedy spread carefully during the whole events of the movie . Clint made a bunch of brilliant scenes and I very much like the two scene where he deliberately draws his hand as a fake gun , the last scene of Walt's death was altogether strong , tragic , and joyful for justice has been done by the his sacrifice which lead to the arrest of the Hmong gangsters .Clint made a powerful , funny , and emotional performance , which I truthfully think should at least get an Academy Award nomination .Finally I probably should end my review with the a praise of the skillfully composed , astonishingly written , gently performed soundtrack song named the same the movie Gran Torino , which was the icing on the cake .",7,0,1,16 January 2009
Into the Wild," Outstanding cinematic journey
","' Into the Wild ' is an outstanding cinematic journey , based on a true story about a young man , Christopher Johnson Mccandles , who donates his college saving , and takes a journey across the country in search of happiness , solitude , and fleeting from the soul captive restrictions of society . Sean Penn did an excellent job directing this film , taking full advantage of the flashback usage in various scenes . The acting was incredible , Emile Hirsch shouldn't have been ignored by The Oscars(which that is not new to them to ignore such wonderful roles) , the old Hal halbrook did in his share of the few minutes he appeared in , what most actors have failed to in there lifetime career > The Brilliance of Eddie vedder's music was yet another reason why this film is so successful, the soundtrack of the movie was overwhelming and perfectly suitable .",8,0,1,20 November 2008
WALL·E," Amazing animated tale of romance, comedy , and a daring vision of the future
","Andrew Stanton amazingly directed, co-written the latest of Pixar's masterpieces , Wall-E .The heartwarming tale of a robot who is left alone on the uninhabitable earth 700 years after it was left by humans to leave the tiny cleaning robot , WALL-E (Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) alone . Wall-E finds the meaning of his living when another robot EVE(Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator) arrives to earth . With such great humorous and dramatic screenplay , and a brilliant directing ,with a very insightful vision of the far future Andrew Stanton successfully sent a message that we should stop violating and destroying the earth , as we are doing now or the consequences will be huge an destructive , and also that we could not keep depending more and more on machines or we will actually become like them . And As always Pixar Animating team abilities are proved every year to be the best in the genre , with great graphics and consideration for every little detail , that gave the film additional cuteness and incredible niceness . WALL-E's Soundtrack and especially the song 'Down to Earth ' is yet another cause of the wonderful atmosphere of the movie and it's acceptance and love by all the audience of all ages .",10,1,5,14 January 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Overrated, boring , not funny , and Utterly Pointless
","First of all i would like to say that I'm a big fan of the old woody Allen , i mean the great director/writer woody Allen , who created in over thirty years in the business some of the most romantic , funny . dramatic , masterpieces that shined in Hollywood starting from Annie Hall , to Hannah and her sisters , Mighty Aphrodite , and last but not least Sweet and lowdown . But the new woody Allen has produced many unbalanced , mildly funny , and romantically dead movies such as Melinda and Melinda which was acceptable , but not a woody Allen material , Hollywood Ending which wasn't so bad as well but wasn't good either , and this year his latest film came out and i had mixed feeling about it , i was frightened that another disappointing movie from the master Allen could destroy my love to his earlier masterpieces , and unfortunately , it was even more disappointing than i could ever imagine . The movie's basic concept is actually more similar to a combination of Baywatch and Desperate housewives , but apparently with higher level of acting . It's about two amazingly beautiful women Vicky (Rebecca hall) the committed ,engaged , and somehow mature woman who chose Barcelona to get her masters degree in Catalan Identity , and Cristina(Scarlett Johansson) , the spontaneous , free spirited , less mature who came to Barcelona in a self finding journey . Vicky and Cristina Meet Juan Antonie the passionate painter who suffers after a bad split from his girlfriend Marie Elena who tried to kill , Juan Antonia has an affair with Vicky, before he gets involved in a relationship with Cristina , then Marie Elena comes back in the picture and lives with Cristina and Juan Antonia , after she tried to kill herself . However i can't see the whole point of the movie , and as i said before the movie is an odd combination of Baywatch and desperate housewives ,because so many affairs happen during it's kind of short length , and it's basically about good-looking people showing off on screen with good acting skills , but no real sense of the movie . but Despite that Penelope Cruz managed to catch the eye with a very good performance that actually was the most and only beautiful thing in the movie . In The end i really hope that Woody Allen comes back to what he did before making great movies and entertaining , and making millions of people all around the globe laugh .",2,121,199,12 January 2009
Donnie Darko," Best of the Best
","when I first saw the trailer of this movie on television , i thought it was just another lame Sci-Fi flick , but then i logged on to IMDb and saw the high rating and the reviews and decided to watch it , and when i first watched it i couldn't understand most of it , but something kept dragging me to watch again , so i bought the DVD and watched three times consequentially at first and then i watched it over and over , and i watched over 50 times in total , and i still don't know why . the things that i know for sure why this movie is great is simply everything all the cast were great , and the story and the combination of the elements of a Sci-Fi Movie and a romantic teen drama , makes it Great , in addition it's to it's complexity that requires you to think it over and over to understand . This movie is definitely my personal favorite , and i don't mind watching it over and over again .. 10/10",10,4,8,2 April 2008
