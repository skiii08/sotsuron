Saturday Night Fever," Better than what most people would expect of the stereotype
","Travolta's potential as an actor is seen in this film more than any other. Sure, he was good in Pulp Fiction, but this film shows that he has potential for more range.  As for the movie itself, I think there is more to the movie than just disco moves and acting like hoodlums.  Tony (Travolta) is your average Italian generation joe who has conflicts about whether he should be sticking around the usual gang of crude friends or try for better.  Along the way, many other topics are hit upon.  Now let's face it...the dancing and the music are the highlights.  Even if you hate disco, you'll be amazed by Travolta's moves that made the Pulp Fiction moves look like granny steps.  And the songs are just classics.If you haven't seen this flick yet, definitely rent it.  It should be a rite of passage, just like watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail in college and Caddyshack in high school.  And do get the R version (the PG versions is for wusses).",7,4,5,14 April 2002
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Overrated
","I liked the small clips of Borat I saw on Ali G, so I really was looking forward to seeing this film. However, after watching it, some of the gags worked, while others were plain terrible.Let me preface the following by saying I'm not adverse to offensive humor...hey, I love South Park. However, while South Park uses its humor to convey a (almost always) great message, 'Borat' is filled with scatological humor that gets tiring after 40 minutes with nowhere to go. No doubt, the 'wrestling scene' was hilarious, but with its multiple allusions to sex and body excrement, I got tired of it after a while. I think if half the sex/BE jokes were left out, and Borat was more 'gullible' than his horny self and an uninitiated stranger to the American ways in a more realistic way (e.g. not presenting feces at a dinner table), this would have been a classic. But as some folks that I saw it with said...'in the end, the Americans won, because it showed them to be on the whole much kinder than the mind behind Borat'. While it may be a satire on people, it did not do so convincingly, and in the end, I think I could have waited for it on DVD.6/10.",6,4,9,24 November 2006
Constantine," Dangerous Habits...
","'Dangerous Habits' is the title of the Hellblazer graphic novel upon which 'Constantine' is based. It is also a decent description of the pattern that Hollywood has recently been taking to adapting graphic novels. While I do accept that movies that are adapted from novels need a little trimming, Hollywood had the habit of re-writing the whole premise to make it 'original'. 'Sin City' was really the one true exception, but in turn, it almost created a backlash for the director.The cast is (for the most part) exceptional. Rachel Wiesz as the detective with an unknown power is charming as always. Tilda Swinton does her androgynous turn as the angel Gabriel, Djimon Hounsou as the African mystic Midnite is perfect, and Peter Stomare, a great character actor recently seen as the torturer in 'The Brothers Grimm', puts a nice touch on the Satan character. Heck, even Gavin Rossdale from Bush is fun as the half-breed demon Balthazar.But unfortunately, Keanu Reeves is cast as Constantine--mistake one. Anyone who has read Hellblazer knows that even in the dreariest of moments, Constantine has a little life in him. Reeves, on the other hand, decides to redo Neo as a psychic detective with wood in his heart. Not good. Mistake two--the script falls on its face. We never truly understand why Satan and his minions want to torture Constantine so bad. The explanation given was so weak that Satan would have a grudge on many more people than just Constantine. Also, Constantine from the novel was always selfish, and would always use magic to resolve his problems, which only created more problems for himself and those he loved. Not necessarily in this case. In this movie, he is a relatively moral character. The role of the other characters are pretty much warped from the original story. Finally, by trying to use elements of one novel with a mutation of another ('Dangerous Habits' and 'Son of Man', respectively), the filmmakers cram too much in to even develop any characters.On the whole, Constantine is a relatively fun flick, but a)check your logic in at the front desk, and b) Hellblazer fans should think twice before seeing it.",6,2,5,13 September 2005
Hotel Rwanda," Cheadle's tour de force
","I remember an old joke from David Letterman from one of his top 10 list that was titled something like 'Top 10 things you will never hear' and number 6 was something to the effect: 'Hey, are you going to see that new Don Cheadle movie?' Dave is probably eating his words now. I have rarely seen a performance that was as realistic as Cheadle's as Paul Rusesabagina. I can't say that I know Mr. Rusesabagina, but I sure felt like I knew him after this film. Cheadle makes the character believable because he is able to convey the character's personality not only by his delivery, but the by subtle nuances not often seen in film. I couldn't imagine any other actor in this role, and Mr. Cheadle really carries this film forward. Though I give kudos for director Terry George for not only bringing this hard story to life, but doing a terrific job with the directing, as well as the other cast members, Cheadle is the one who carries this film. On a side note, many would like to compare this to 'Schindler's List'. While the subject is similar in that one man saves thousands, you realize that Mr. Rusesabagina probably had a harder job because while Mr. Schindler already had some clout with the Nazis, Mr. Rusesabagina had no real sympathizers and had to use any resources he could while his own life and family were in danger. A harrowing and gripping drama with Cheadle carrying his weight throughout the film.",10,0,0,26 May 2005
The Adventures of Tintin," Great adventure even for those who have not read Tintin
","A brief background: It seems that Tintin is popular everywhere in the world except the US. Even Indians have heard of him. My wife was dying to see it, and I had read one volume I bought her; entertaining, but I was certainly not a huge fan.Now the movie: very entertaining film. The film tries not to stray away from the depictions of many of the characters of the comic, as well as mannerisms. You certainly won't get the same style of storytelling that you saw in the Herge comics, but the story is as intricate and fun to follow as Spielberg's previous adventure outings. Caat is excellent in all respects, especially Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock. While the action may be more dynamic than what was in the Tintin comics, it is certainly fun and exciting. The CGI is great, especially for translating a comic (a live film would have only detracted from the storytelling). And all this was without watching the 3D version.Overall, even if you have never heard of Tintin, or are vaguely familiar, it will be a fun ride.",9,1,4,25 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The pieces of the jigsaw start to fit...
","Warning: Possible spoilers Those who thought Phantom Menace sucked will not be disappointed by this film.  Most of the reviews already focus on the plot, so let me just go to the good and the bad. The good:  Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Great actor to begin with, and pretty much acts just like I would expect a younger Obi-Wan to.  Christopher Lee as Count Dooku (informally Darth Tyrannus).  Who better to play the precursor to Darth Vader.  Incidentally, it seems like his name is in reference to Count Dracu (in history, Dracu was the father of Vlad the Impaler aka Count Dracula).  Yoda...now you will see why he is truly THE master jedi  ('Kick your ass I will!')--has the screen stealing part of this movie, and probably one of the best 'actors' in this movie.  The action sequences are truly amazing...much improved on from Phantom Menace.  Look for a lightsaber fight between Dooku and Skywalker which is reminiscent of the saber fight in Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi but more artistic.  And the Jedi battle with the droid army is kick-ass, especially with Mace Windu (Sam Jackson) getting medeivel on some droid.Finally, and most importantly, this movie makes a better link to Episodes 4-6 than Episode 1.  In Episode 1, even though it made more name recognitions than links, it served more as a prologue than a part of the episodes (a la Hobbit and Lord of the Rings).  Here, we see more important connections:  How the clones came into the picture of the whole story, how Anakin's temperament will eventually lead him to the dark side, Jedi training tactics, how (and who) the Emperor will come into making the Empire, and phrases from episodes 4-6 like 'He (Darth Vader)is more machine than man' and 'He (Luke) is impatient, just like his father', and even minor characters like Uncle Owen and Bail Organa of Alderaan (Leia's adopted father) start to fit into everything. The bad:  The romance between Skywalker and Padme.  Could have been written more maturely, but ends up like a kindergarten romance.  Almost brings the movie to Phantom Menace level (the other scenes save it from this).  This is my biggest gripe about the film;  if this is the key to Episodes 4-6, then don't put it down by making it look like a puppy love type of romance.  I understand that Anakin has a crush on Padme, but please show me that the parents of Luke and Leia were more mature than this when they fell in love! Secondly, Natalie Portman is totally miscast as Padme.  Don't get me wrong...she is an excellent actress, and very beautiful, but quite frankly, she doesn't have the pizzaz and feistiness of Princess Leia/Carrie Fischer to spice up the movie.  It seems like Padme is more of the damsel in distress who dresses up pretty /kinky than a leader in this film.  Then again, you can also blame Lucas and other screenwriters for putting her in this situation.  Third, Hayden Christansen is appropriately cast as Anakin, but he is wrongly directed.  Like Natalie, a very good actor with good screen presence, but except for the scenes where he is angry, impatient, or in action, he comes across as more wooden than human. So pretty much, if you want to be entertained, or if you liked Star Wars when it came out and want to know more, you will like this film. Now my only concern is with the liberties Lucas has taken with these prequels.  I feel like he has included characters like R2-D2 and C-3PO more as a way to make a connection to the original episodes than as characters to be developed.  I mean, if you recall in Episodes 4-6, they have no idea about Skywalker being their master, and don't really know Kenobi well.  Do they have their memories erased in Episode 3?  How about the fact that in Episode 5, Kenobi tells Luke that Yoda trained Obi-wan, but in Episode 1, Kenobi is the apprentice to Qui-Jonn Jin?  If Lucas and his screenwriting friends are going to draft Episode 3, then I really suggest they view Episodes 4-6 again and fill in the gaps in Episode 3 as to not make the prequels as looking like different movies than Episodes 4-6.",6,0,0,30 May 2002
Forrest Gump," Reelin' in the years...'Being There'
","Saw this in the IMDb 250, and couldn't believe it was ranked this high. Quite frankly, very sappy film about a mentally challenged individual and how he influences key events through his life. I liked it when it first came out, but every time I see it on TV, I realize that this is a terrible movie. Essentially, it's a baby-boomer's movie reminiscing about the events of times past. And the more I see it, it reminds me of an earlier, even craftier movie with a simple-minded character which was far more intelligent than this film will ever be...'Being There' with Peter Sellers. Essentially the same story, but Sellers pulls of the role more convincingly and the story unfolds much better. Forget this film--'Being There' is the film to watch.",4,3,5,8 December 2005
Watchmen," Great Rendition of the Novel, but lost its appeal
","I read Watchmen 6 years ago, and absolutely loved it. I had heard through the websites that the movie was going to be made, but never thought that it would happen. Then I saw the preview at 'The Dark Knight', and I knew it would be pretty close to the novel.Now I've finally seen the movie, what I can say is this: Great rendition of the novel, but the appeal that the graphic novel had is still lost on screen. Watchmen the novel took what we who read comics knew as convention and spun it on its head, while taking a piece on how superheroes would function in 'the real world', and presented the adult themes in comics, with a lot of 'annotations' and symbolism. Watchmen the movie pretty much took the functionality part of it, while portraying superheroes as semi-flawed (which the novel does); however, these ideas have already been made into movies (maybe not good ones, but it's been done). The result is the audiobook equivalent of the graphic novel--one person's abridged interpretation of a masterpiece. Now, to give the movie credit, the effects are beautiful, and the acting (esp. Jackie Haley as Rorsharch) is good; heck, even the climax/end is more plausible/convincing than the novel's. However, as I watch this movie, I think that if this had been made 20 years before, it would have been to movies what the graphic novel was to comics. Definitely nice watch, but not earthshattering.",7,1,3,11 August 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," A traitor to the spirit of the original Matrix
","WARNING:  POSSIBLE SPOILERSWhen a movie is made in sequels, especially with a purpose of an ending, one expects some kind of closure in the motif of the original.  The first Star Wars triad had this, as does the Godfather series.  The Matrix series, though, has abandoned the feel of the original and seems to have wandered off babbling to the end, not knowing what it was.The original Matrix was a classic; a thinking man's 'TRON'.  Not only did it have a good story with an interesting philosophy, but the action was original and the balance on all aspects of film making was equal.  Matrix Reloaded seemed to try to tip the balance towards the action side, with a decline in acting and story, and more of an emphasis on action and special effects.  The big promise in this film, though, was that we would understand more about the matrix itself and the origins and powers of 'The One'.Matrix Revolutions, with everything above taken into account, is an utter failure.  It abandons almost everything that made the original great and starts rambling along.  While many will argue that it's more about the philosophy, I found that aspect lacking.  On a movie on its own, I would have hated this film for its lack of originality; as part of a series, it is an utter failure.(Here are the spoilers, so beware)Let's start talking about Neo's special powers at the end of Reloaded.  We are never given an adequate explanation on how he got them other than that 'the powers of the one extend beyond the matrix'.  The reloaded Smith, while taking over the matrix, seems to have no effect on the machines atttacking Zion.  Morpheus, who had a big role in the last two films, seems to be on the backburner in this film; instead, all the small characters who were really not important in the second film get more screen time without any true development.  The frenchman and his woman, who seemed so ominous in the second film, are just a whimper in this film.  Death scenes of major and minor characters are treated more like the Gipper death speech, extending beyond the natural lifespan of a human being.  We never truly understand how Neo defeats Smith--it's more like a quick ending to finish it all once and for all.  Even the peace between machine and humans thing was never adequately explained or followed.  Finally, scenes from Star Wars, Aliens, the Wizard of Oz, and  even the original Matrix have been rehashed, destroying the originality that made the first Matrix so great.Worst of all was the the complete disregard for good action scenes.  In Reloaded, we at least had a great highway sequence, and an excellent lobby sequence, and a decent alley sequence.  Here, the action scenes last at the most one minute, are totally unoriginal, and pure trash.  Even the promising fight between Smith and Neo becomes a cliched 'war of the gods', with both flying around, bouncing into each other and just hitting each other.  No cool martial arts, no nothing.  What a pity.You, like me, might go to see the movie for closure.  I really cannot recommend this film even for closure.  After coming out of the theatre, I felt cheated and decieved by Matrix Reloaded.  Sometimes, it is best just to leave the original be and let it be remembered as a classic on its own rather than trying to rehash it again just for profits.",2,1,1,6 November 2003
Salt," Waste of $1
","Got this from Redbox after it was recommended to me by brother-in-law.Quite frankly, it sucked a big one. While I don't expect action thrillers to have that much in the way of plot evolution, this movie was to the point of ludicrous. With its multiple twists, do you really expect a sane individual to even get into the flick? By the time half of the movie was over, my wife and I were laughing at the defiance of the law of physics and ridiculous plot convolutions that it made a Bollywood film look like 'Hamlet'. And worst still, it takes itself too seriously.Angelina Jolie is quickly becoming the female 'Nicholas Cage', acting in stupid flicks with stupid plots while giving her silly pouts; worse yet, she has good potential as a good actress, as seen in 'Gia' or even 'Changeling'. Direction is competent, but I was surprised to see Philip Noyce ('Patriot Games', 'Rabbit Proof Fence') directed, since he has done better films in the past. When I found out Kurt Wimmer ('Equilibrium', 'Ultraviolet') wrote it, I finally figured out why this was a stupid flick to begin with. The rest of the cast, while potentially good, went wasted.Please don't waste your money on this garbage. Hollywood, please stop wasting money on trash like this.",4,0,2,3 January 2011
Disturbia," Overrated
","Rear Window meets teeny-bopper flick. That's basically how to describe this film. SPOILERS........this movie could have worked on a paranoia level (a la American 'Dark Water') and kept along that track. However, while the first half starts out pretty decent and looks like it will lead to paranoid schizo thoughts, it segue-ways into a teen love story, and then just drops into a stupid, PG-13'esque slasher mode, with no common sense whatsoever. Many lapses in story telling (e.g. where's Mom through half the story) coupled with a stereotypical ending should have made this a direct-to-DVD flick instead. Only saving grace may be Shaia LeBeouf, who is charismatic, and has potential to go places. Otherwise, pure fluff.",5,1,3,24 September 2007
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," I've seen better films out of Bollywood
","If you have seen a Bollywood film, you know most are all flash with very little substance. Unfortunately, I would have taken one of those over this rubbish.I picked it up on the great reviews I had heard, and watched it in Blu-Ray. When the beginning credits start rolling, when I saw that China TV and Alibaba were financing this, I had a hunch this was going to be bad.Without giving too much away, this is a Tom Cruise love fest, with a rehash of old stories. Once again, IMF is in trouble, but this time from the Feds for funding and incorporation into the CIA. All because one agent (Ethan Hunt) believes in the 'Syndicate' and there is collateral damage. Hey, this is like the first movie when he gets 'NOC''ed off and has to prove himself innocent. Action is always with a suit that somehow can weather the worst of conditions (off an airplane, bombing, fights, desert, etc.). The bad guy somehow has the unique insight to be indefeasible until Hunt is able to use some plot that appears to be hatched out of a Shamylan picture. Plot is pretty much a skeleton of the last few MI films, with some 'twists' (which are pretty lame) in between. The supporting cast is basically there to give either humor (Pegg), crazy technical assistance (Rhames), glam (Ferguson), or just a warm body (Renner). Man, I could have used a few musical numbers with Cruise and Ferguson in some outlandish outfits with backup dancers to spice this movie up!That being said, the action scenes are kind of cool if you watch them in a vacuum. In context to the plot, they become tiresome; either they drag too long, or they fail in the sense of 'Everyone else is deaf, dumb and blind'. I would rather watch Jackie Chan fight scenes from his worst movies; at least I know he is taking a beating for real, they work in context of the film, and he can make it look good.While I understand that the MI films are what Tom Cruise can bank on for a check, it gets pretty stale when comparing the MI show of the 60s. The TV show at least had everyone participating in a pivotal role to carry out their mission. It never was about Phelps, Collier, Hand, or Armitage; they all worked together to make the mission work. Tom's MI film are him doing the dirty job so he gets the glory.Old Tom is getting up there in age, and it really shows in this film. He needs to let some more talented actors (not just one, but 3-4) take the reigns of the franchise and just produce it. Grow up Tom. Even Burt Lancaster knew when to hang up the action movies. Don't waste your $1.50 rental on this film ($1 on DVD)",4,2,5,3 February 2016
Batman Begins," Substance over style
","Though I'm not an avid graphic novel reader, I do like the medium because it plays out like a movie, and the plots are more complex than are put on screen. However, many movies which try to adapt graphic novels to screen mutilate the original in the process (with the exception of the recent 'Sin City').'Batman Begins', however, is not based on any graphic novel. But by the way it was written and directed, it sure could have been. This has to be the most mature Batman to hit the screen. Gone is the campiness of the original series, and the hallucinogenic visions of the last 4 Batman films. This Batman/Bruce Wayne, while younger, probably has more innovation in a single frame than the previous Batman films. There is more insight on what he does to take out his frustrations, and how he channels them. We also see how he is capable of making a Batcave, how he makes the gadgets that he uses, and finally, how human Batman really is (as witnessed by the number of bruises he gets after a night of fighting.Christian Bale has always been a pretty decent actor, and as Bruce Wayne/Batman, he brings more depth into the role and any of the 4 actors who played him previously. Liam Neeson was a surprise as Ducard, and handles the role well. Likewise for Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Rutger Hauer. As for Katie Holmes, she's adequate.If I had one gripe about the film, it was that the some of the action scenes were choppy and couldn't be appreciated as well as, say, the first Batman. But this point actually makes the case: if you got a gripping story, you don't need cheap theatrics to make it great. Substance over style. Just like an well written graphic novel.",9,1,1,28 June 2005
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Better than MI2, on par with MI1
","OK, a few things before the review: a) I hated MI2--the MI series went from team mentality to Tom Cruise as James Bond outing; b) enjoyed MI1 for its team ops, but ended becoming a little too much of a Tom Cruise vehicle; c) skipped MI3 as this was during Tom Cruise's Scientology head-trips; d) was convinced by my friends to watch MI4 after someone bought my ticket.MI4 is definitely better than what I expected for the Tom Cruise MI flicks. Yes, it still is a Tom Cruise love fest, but definitely much more team dynamics than I expected. If there was a real star here, it would be Jeremy Renner as Brandt, the IMF analyst with a past; he is tough, but brings humanity to the character he plays. Also, glad to see that Paula Patton was great as Jane, another IMF agent, without being the romantic object of Ethan Hunt--plus, it's great to see a female hang as tough as the other IMF agents. Simon Pegg does bring in the comic relief, but sometimes could be a little annoying. While I like Michael Nyqvist from his role in the 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' series, his role here could have easily been played by another actor (Stellan Skaargard comes to mind). That being said, action got to the point that it got a little too overwhelming at times. The Burj Khalifa scene, while fun to watch, had so many twists and turns (as well as big holes--who (guest included) wouldn't notice a guy going up all these windows or glass falling from it)) it became humorous. The race scene in Mumbai was a laugh--if you've been in Mumbai, you know that traffic is so anarchic, any vehicle in a chase would end up in a crash. At least it got realistic when there was a big pedestrian crossing.In the end, for me, this was a better MI than I expected, but still the emphasis is on making Tom Cruise look great. As my wife, who is from India said: Tom Cruise is the 'Govinda' of American films. For the uninitiated to Bollywood, Govinda is an popular Indian actor-dancer who will find himself in the most unlikely and impossible of action scenarios, but will always pull it off with a smirk of his pearly whites.",7,2,5,29 December 2011
28 Days Later...," A good risk on a combo of genres
","I heard a lot about this film, and the previews looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try over T3 and the other summer films.  Overall, it reminded me a lot of 'From Dusk to Dawn':  a combination of genres in a so-called horror film.  BUT...I respect Danny Boyle for some of the risks he takes in cinema (at least, when it's not a commercial film he's doing).  First, the use of digital video gives the film a feel of authenticity, a la 'Blair Witch Project'. Second, the one thing I really loved in this film was the opening sequence with the main character walking through an empty London.  How they did it is beyond me; heck, I really don't want to know-that's real movie magic. Third, rock music seems to be the atmosphere-setter in Boyle's films, and once again, he utilizes songs well to set an atmosphere.  Finally, combining a survival film with a road trip film and a zombie flick is tough, but Boyle does manage to narrate the film well.  Furthermore, he directs a cast of no-names with good command; their interactions are believeable (for the most part).Yes, the zombie theory is more believeable in this film (when compared to others).  There were a few times when it felt like the acting was 'pushed'. For me, though, what could have made the movie better was a few cuts during the road trip segment and during the 3rd act of the movie.  Otherwise, a definite recommendation, especiallly over films in the summer of 2003 like 'Legally Blonde 2', '2 Fast 2 Furious' and 'Charlie's Angels 2'.",8,0,0,6 July 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Overrated
","Being that I had seen many films from Hong Kong, my basic feeling is that this movie was overrated.  Yes, I expected some action with drama, which the movie did give, but the plot of the movie (spoiled rich princess wants to be #1) didn't captivate me.First the good.  Yes, the cinematography was beautiful, giving one glimpses of China never seen.  Second, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat were great.  I was especially surprised to see Chow do so well for an actor known as a gun toting hero.  The fight scenes were, for the most part, well choreographed, especially the scene with Michelle and Ying Zhang.So why overrated?  First of all, there were many kung-fu movies with similar or even better fight scenes.  Second, I just couldn't buy the 'flying leaps' seen here, especially for a film trying to be dramatic; how do they get the magic to do it?  Third, the character of the princess just annoyed me.  I think it would have been better to focus more on the characters of Michelle and Chow than on what seemed to be a spoiled brat.  Finally, I try to get the main gist of the film, but it just doesn't come to me.Quite frankly, if Ang Lee's name wasn't on this film, I doubt it would have gotten the recognition it got.  Yes, I know that's how the world turns, but a director's name can't influence how you see a film; it should be able to stand on its own.  For me, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is slightly above average, but not worthy of the recognition it got.",6,0,1,26 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," From the director of 'Bad Taste', who made LOTRFOR, i.e. 'Good Taste', now has made 'Better Taste'
","Warning: Possible spoilersI actually enjoyed Peter Jackson's older, more disturbing movies such as 'Bad Taste' (ironically, his first one), 'Meet The Feebles', and 'Dead-Alive'.  That's because he's a no B.S. director who lets his imagination take him to great heights.  Yet he also can be a gentle story teller, as seen in 'Heavenly Creatures'.So no doubt, when he was set to direct the LOTR series, I had no doubts that he would do a smash up job.  The result?  Well, we could easily call FOTR 'Good Taste'.  George Lucas should take a refresher in storytelling from Jackson and his wife Fran Walsh.  Yes, the story had been written, but to adapt it for the screen is in itself a rewriting of a story in itself. If one wants to see a truly bad adaptation, just watch Ralph Bakshi's LOTR, and see how one could trash a simple storyline.  And no doubt, being a fan of Tolkien helped Jackson be more critical of himself.  Jackson juggles backround storytelling and many characters with beautiful cinematography and dazzling special effects.So what does this have to do with LOTR:T2T?  This movie should be called 'Better Taste'.  While I loved FOTR, it did drag at certain moments, but this is simply due to storyline and not to bad writing.  The first thing that T2T does right is that it doesn't catch us up with LOTR, which in itself is a blessing.  Quite frankly, Jackson not only did a brilliant job of making 3 films at one time, but also knew that eventually, everyone will be watching these films back to back on their mutlit-DVD players with HDTV, so why bore us with redundant material?  Second, Jackson knows where to use CGI environments and how to use them.  If we want to see serenity, we use the real thing.  When we want see an ominous scene, especially at night, CGI works beautifully.  And this is where another previously famous fantasy movie's first 2 prequels fail.  And while we are on the subject, let's get on Gollum, the CGI character who almost steals the show from the human characters.  Not only is he made more realistically than another dumb CGI character (i.e. Jar Jar Binks from SW:TPM), but the team that created him really knows human emotions and how do interpret them digitally.  And let's not forget the beautiful job with the Ents as well!  Kudos to WETA!  And finally, Jackson shows us how great a visualist he is.  Scenes such as the confrontation between the Ring Wraith and Frodo, the Battle of Helm's Deep, and Frodo in the Swamp are some of the most beautiful pictures ever put on film.So will LOTR:ROTK be 'Best Taste'?  If the current trend stays, then most definitely yes. 10/10",10,0,0,6 January 2003
Million Dollar Baby," The most human film in years
","After reading all the reviews, I still did not know what to expect out of 'Million Dollar Baby' ('MDB'). Was it a female 'Rocky'? Or was it about relationships? Well, after watching this film last night, I have to say that this is one of those films that is more about people and human nature than anything else.Clint Eastwood as a film maker has done what few actor/directors have done: make a succession of films that have gotten more mature and better with age. He started tackling complicated issues such as murder, mythology, and feminism with 'Unforgiven' (which almost single-handedly deconstructed the Western genre), and then went after other great dramas with 'Mystic River', 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil', and 'The Bridges of Madison County'. However, Mr. Eastwood has proved to be a master of exploring humans with 'Million Dollar Baby' If I was to summarize this film, I'd give a lot of the movie away and ruin the experience. So let me clarify a few things to get you prepared. It is not a female 'Rocky'--'Rocky' was about a chance of a lifetime; 'MDB' is more complicated, exploring themes of determination, taking chances, and courage. Secondly, it is only partially about boxing. While we do learn about the intricacies of boxing, it does a better job about exploring the minds of the people involved. Finally, these characters are people who you know in your life, and they are not treated with kid gloves; everything is presented straightforward, with nothing to hide.If you are looking for a plot, I can say that there is a very skimpy one. However, like a good story, it bonds you to all the characters, and in the end, you will be jolted. Along with 'Unforgiven', this is his masterpiece. Hillary Swank is making her way to be the next great actress since Meryl Streep. Clint Eastwood courageously shows more emotion and range than he ever has on film. And Morgan Freeman, who is usually portrayed as a low talking father figure, adds a good foundation to the film as a whole. Direction is tight, and the score, while simple, is very moving. Forget the big budget blockbusters and give this small film a watch; by far one of the best American films to come out in a while.10/10",10,4,7,31 January 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Better than average, but lacks depth
","I was half-way into reading the book when I decided to catch the movie because of the hype. Wife never read the book. After viewing the film, while I enjoyed it better than the average American thriller, I was not as overwhelmed by it as the hype surrounding the film. To give it credit, the two protagonists, Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Bloomqvist, are definitely an interesting crime solving duo, and one of the most unique in recent times. Both the actors do a good job with their characters. However, while the book takes its time in delving into the the intricacies of the mystery, I felt that the movie kind of cut out some of the interesting relationships that kept you interested in the story. Also, a key element in the book (Venestrom affair) were briefly alluded to in the movie, but are probably key in making this story more poignant. Wife and I both agree that while not overwhelming, it did jog our interest to see the second movie. Personally, would have waited for the rental. I am interested to see if the Hollywood version can make itself more powerful, but will wait for reviews before even considering going to see it.",7,0,2,19 July 2010
Black Hawk Down," Best movie about guerrila warfare ever
","I had heard about this movie since about October of 2001.  The fact that Ridley Scott was directing was exciting enough, but the fact that this was about the 1993 battle in Moghadishu, Somalia was all the more reason to see this.  I vividly remember Somalis dragging our dead shirtless soldiers through the street like they were a piece of meat and was thoroughly p***ed off by that.  Many in the press at the time called that a failure of our special forces, which I did not buy; I thought that our special forces did well, but it's the men in Washington (especially Clinton) who messed up.Before seeing this movie, I saw Lord of the Rings and thought that that was one of the only movies of 2001 worth seeing.  I now have to place 'Black Hawk Down' in this category as well.  This movie captures everything about the hell of war as well as US intervention in other countries.  Yes, we can make similarities to 'Private Ryan', but this movie hits closer to home because a. it speaks about the type of war we are now used to (guerrila warfare), which really doesn't have a winner and b. the fact that we are facing a current war now.Most films on war so far have dealt with the conventional war that we are used to seeing.  A possible exception may be 'Platoon', about the Vietnam war, but I really count that as a conventional war because we had a defined enemy.  This movie, on the other hand, deals with an unexpected confrontation with an enemy that really had no face--a true guerrila war. The movie spares nothing to the imagination.  I myself felt lost in parts of Moghadishu with the soldiers; the film makes you relate with what it was like to try to find your way to a downed helicopter while having to fight an enemy that you couldn't really see or identify.  What is was like to be forgotten and find your way to your company in a mindfield of people who were after you.  What it was like to see people you worked with blown apart by rockets while having to fight the faceless enemy.  I could go on, but I'll let you see the film instead.  I was also surprised by the fact that they did show the dead american soldiers being dragged through the streets, and quite frankly, as disturbing and sickening as it was, I'm glad they did to show how chaotic it was.And the best part of the film is that none of this is glorified.  We are not seeing Rambo blowing the Somalis to smithereens while he never sustains a scratch and able to escape a situation with his brute strength.  We instead see and feel what it is like to fight a real war and be pinned down, even when you are the best of the best.  I give a lot of credit to Ken Nolan (screenwriter) and Ridley Scott for not venturing into Hollywood territory. Ridley himself wanted to make this film a documentary, and has done a beautiful job at doing that.  I was almost scared that it would when I saw that Jerry Bruckheimer was producing the film.As for the cast, excellent job by all.  Yes, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor, and Josh Harnett are in it, but as far as I'm concerned, they did their job; they made me believe that they were the soldiers fighting this war.Now let me deal with some of the criticism I have read about the film. Some have said that it doesn't allow for characterization.  I think that is thorough B.S.  Watching this film, you ARE with the Special Forces/Delta Force, and though you won't remember the names of all the characters in the film, that works to the film's advantage because to us, they are any Tom, Dick, and Harry that we know on the street, not some superhuman commando portrayed by a faux hero like Arnold.  We empathize more with them. Second, some will say that this movie is racist because it shows black guys fighting against white guys.  Hey, this isn't the US; it is Somalia, and everyone there is black.  And most of the special Forces were indeed white (from what I understand, only 2 of the commandos were African Americans, and one is portrayed in this film).I say that this should get at least a nomination for best picture and best director, if not win in these two categories.Finally, this movie should be recommended viewing for the entire public and especially to the beauracrats in Washington; the beauracrats should know what it's like to send our forces into an area that they barely know and into a war that is not ours.  I never blamed the troops for what happened; they were just doing what they were ordered to do, and they did it superiorly in the situation they were in.  Instead, I blame draft-dodgers like Clinton for putting them in such a hot situation without thinking things out.I've always had respect for our men in armor, and this movie is a testamen t to those who put their lives on the line for their country.  God bless the 18 soldiers who left us and the United States Armed forces.",8,1,2,20 January 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Best Musical in a long time
","'Hedwig' kicks ass!  Plain and simple as that.  'Rocky Horror' may be considered a classic, but this movie is far more superior.
Now, sure, one will obviously compare this to 'Rocky Horror', but other than being about transexuals and being a musical, that is where the comparisons end.  While 'Rocky Horror' is more a campy musical made with overt silliness, 'Hedwig' is more intelligent, especially because the songs echo the story line(similar to 'Cabaret') but more obviously.  And what can be said about the main star, John Cameron Mitchell, who not only directed and adapted this movie to the screen, but magnificently plays Hedwig.  And let me me completely honest:  the music rocks.  It not only acknowledges its glam rock roots (which Rocky horror did not), but does a bang up job in its performance (just listen to 'The Angry Inch' song and don't tell me you want to rock!).  And while I will not go into the depth of the story (I think most of the reviews here will tell you enough), I will say that Hedwig has more class, style and integrity than David Bowie anyday (and I admire Bowie, though I'm NOT a fan).Just watch the movie!  It rocks!P.S.  If you are easily offended by talk of transexual operations (no scenes, thankfully), homosexual foreplay (although it isn't really homosexual if you think about it), and dressing in drag, I suggest you don't watch this film.",9,0,1,4 January 2002
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight realized
","I'll first start w/ saying that if you haven't seen 'Batman Begins', you should grab the DVD and watch it, as it will set a little background that may be needed for the first few scenes, and (if you haven't seen Batman since the Tim Burton/Schumacher era) you will be surprised by the 180 degree turn in tone and maturity.That said, 'The Dark Knight' is to 'Batman Begins' as 'Empire Strikes Back' is to 'Star Wars'...more fleshed out, better acting, and better action. The fact that Mr. Nolan uses 'real' actors helps the film better juggle the multiple characters with more ease. A lot has been said about Mr. Ledger's Joker, and I agree that it is probably one of the most cunning, pathological characters ever put to screen. However, credit has to be given to Mr. Bale, whose presence as Batman/Bruce Wayne gives the anchor the film would need rather than being lopsided (i.e. Burton's Batman). But the most kudos goes to Chris Nolan, for putting together one of the best, most 'realistic' superhero films ever put to celluloid. The actions scenes are a mix of wit and adrenaline, but we are still brought back to great drama and story, which in all make the film tight.My only issue (and this is where I'll give a deduction of 0.5) is that the ending does leave you feeling that there was less closure than would be anticipated. Nonetheless, this is the Batman film I've been longing for as an adult, and am looking forward to the 3rd one with much anticipation.9.5/10",10,4,9,25 July 2008
Avatar," Technically beautiful; story lacking
","After gathering my thoughts, I will preface this by saying this is a difficult film to review. Specifically, while there were some things I liked about the movie, there are other things I found off-putting.First, let's highlight the strengths. Technically, this was a beautiful film to watch. To get a good experience, I would definitely recommend this in 3D rather than 2D. The imagination put into the world, coupled with the computer imagery, are definitely gripping. The development of the alien species and planet of Pandora was also very remarkable, from language to culture. The special effects are definitely a step towards making computer imagery more lifelike than ever (however, I will stop short of saying 'like nothing you'll ever see...more later). Second, Sam Worthington is the anchor of this movie; very charismatic, but does punctuate his performance with some subtleties that make him more human than others. Third, the sci-fi technology is believable, in the vein of the 2 'Alien' movies.That being said, let's hit the weaknesses. First and foremost, the story was almost a complete rip of 'Dances with Wolves', except in space. Very off-putting, as I think for the time and effort that was put into the film and development of the aliens, I was expecting something more original. Come to think of it, it reminded me of another popcorn movie, Independence Day, but took itself more seriously. Special effects are nice, but if a story is lacking, it can make the experience tedious. Second, when considering the other performances apart from Worthington's (and I include alien ones), they were relatively flat or overacted. Even poor Sigourney Weaver, an actress I really like on the whole, was underutilised in her role. Third, I previously stressed that the movie had to be seen in 3D; I say this because prior to going into this film, I had seen previews, and was not very convinced of the ground-breaking effects. The 3D experience definitely enhances the viewing experience (though I wouldn't say it's a roller-coaster ride), but I could easily say if I had seen it in 2D, my review may have been lower. Finally, like I previously said, the effects were a step above computer imagery as we have seen it. But would I say it had the same gripping experience of first seeing 'Star Wars', or the T-1000 of 'Terminator 2', or even the computer generated scenery of 'Phantom Menace' (which I gave a similar rating for based on story)? Definitely not.In conclusion, I would still recommend watching the movie, with some conditions. First, it must be seen in 3D (IMAX if possible); 2D would only spoil the experience (would definiely not rent it until 3D TV comes out). Second, story expectations should be low (like going to see an IMAX museum film--go for the scenery, discard the story). In the end, it reminded me of my experience listening to Sgt. Pepper; I appreciate the historical technical advances it made, and even like parts of the album, but would still put other albums well above it from a satisfaction standpoint.",7,2,4,23 January 2010
Saw," Pseudo-intelligent film-making
","Hearing the myriad of hype about 'Saw', I decided to rent it and see what was so great about it. After a (approximately) 2 hour viewing, I have to say that it was an insult to the audience's intelligence. The premise of a serial killer giving a chance at life to those who take it for granted is definitely a good one. The photography is also very meticulous and intriguing. But aside of those two things, this movie just plain sucked. First of all, you kind of get the idea of who is plotting everything from the beginning and the 'sins' of the main protagonists. The acting from Cary Elwes and much of the cast leave much to be desired. When you finally get to the end, you realize that you have been suckered all along, but can't say it's genius because there are holes in the rationale. Not to say that I felt cheated on an intellectual level; as a matter of fact, I like films that challenge me, whether I got the killer/concept or not. The problem is that the filmmaker or the scriptwriter makes you think that he came up with a original and genius concept, but then tries to obfuscate his mistakes with an implausible, if not ridiculous, ending while trying to stroke his ego. I cannot stand this type of reckless film-making and neither should the audience.",4,2,3,19 April 2005
The Last Samurai," A testament to the richness of culture
","If you are looking for Kill Bill-like action, then forget this film. Otherwise, it is a great story about the culture that keeps a society together.  I'll be frank...The Tom Cruise character could have had a better impact if it was performed by a more adept actor (Russell Crowe really came to mind).  The real star of the film is the Samurai played by Ken Watanabe. His character exemplifies what makes his culture so precious to the Japanese people.  And through the movie, it shows us how the culture of a people make them who they are and can never really be taken from them if they are strong with it.As for the film itself, old TC, though a decent actor himself, never convinced me that he was the character...the film needed a much stronger character for that role.  On the other hand, Ken Watanabe does a beautiful job as the Samurai.  His performance in itself makes this film worth watching.  The supporting characters are also all well chosen.  A definite watch, but a far cry from an 'Oscar' movie.7/10",7,0,0,15 December 2003
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Vile and Disturbing tribute to MDS
","I had read about Salo on a website called 'Truly disturbing films' (I don't think it exists).  So when I saw it in a videostore, I naturally had to see how disturbing it is.First, the good.  The cinematography is beautiful; gorgeous shot of interiors with good color, and spectacular outside scenes.  Second, the acting is rather impressive for such a disturbing film.  You believe the leaders of this 'camp' are the most sick people on earth, and the poor adolescents are really suffering.  The production values are really first rate.Now, for the disturbing.  Quite frankly, unless you are a cinema scholar and look for a deeper meaning in this film, this film is more a test of how sick can one get on film.  We are eased at first with the internment process of these teens, which almost reminds you of a Nazi selection process.  Then you are taken to the second fourth of the film, where we are shown scenes of rape, sodomy, molestation, and voyeurism, all set against a high class prostitute telling a story about how she became precocious at a young age. The 3rd quartile of the film is appropriately called 'Circle of S---'. Now we really start getting into the disgusting.  To show power, one of the leaders defecates on the floor and makes a poor naked girl eat the product with a spoon.  And if that is not enough, during a celebration of a homosexual marriage, the main dish is steamed excrement.  Again, this is set against another prostitutes telling a story about her past customers obsession with fecal matter.  And then, for the finale, we are subjected to some of the worst tortures put on film.Quite frankly, as most of you can tell, I really couldn't find a poetic side to this; quite frankly, I thought it was an exercise in repulsiveness.  I give Pasolini lots of credit for filming the unfilmable; very few directors, if any, would graphically portray a work of Marquis de Sade, much less make it an adaptation for modern times.  And it is sad that people had to ban this kind of film, in the sense that freedom of speech, even when vile and disgusting, should not be banned; if we start with this, then where does the slippery slope end.  But from my personal point of view, if you are a cinema critic looking for a film to dissect, or if you just want to test your stomach, this is your film; otherwise, stay away",6,1,3,6 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Good Bridge to Episodes IV-VI
","Star Wars III will endure because a)as part of an epic, it explains a lot about why things are how they are in the earlier and later episodes, while bringing two relatively disjointed sections (the fancy but vacuous I and II with the more substantive IV-VI) together and b) as a film on its own standing, the characters and narrative are more fleshed out while including grand battles.Many have commented about the dialogue, and though I do concede that it could get very elementary or concocted, let's not forget Episodes IV-VI weren't necessarily Shakespeare. Major kudos to Ian McDiarmid as the Chancellor, who gave the film the 'Alec Guiness' touch the last two films needed. Only other 'actor' who really shines is Yoda, who really is computer-generated, and gives many actors a run for their money (scary, eh?). My only gripe is that there wasn't a character who really balanced the rest of the cast. To use the IV-VI episodes, Han Solo was the cynical rogue who really balanced the good (Luke/Luke), the bad (Vader) and the ugly (Chewbacca). No cynical rogue in the first three episodes, and probably what was needed to diffuse some of the darkness in Episode III. On the whole, I liked the film, and makes the 'sextology' (six episodes) flow as a whole.",9,2,5,24 May 2005
Ray," One of the best biopics made
","Biopics can be tough to make and act. One has to avoid mimicking the character and needs to convince us that the subject had another life outside the public eye that we can get absorbed in. 'Gandhi' and 'Pride of the Yankees' will probably be put at the top of the biopic list. 'Ray' is definitely a close second. I was close to never seeing this film, fearing that it would fall in league with the mediocre biopic status, despite reviews and Oscars to propel it. However, upon watching this film, I was very impressed by the tightness of the film. Jamie Foxx definitely does a great job in portraying Ray Charles not only as a performer and a talented blind man, but as a person who has many unresolved issues and problems. It is a latter that makes him so deserved of the Academy Award he won. The rest of the characters do a great job, but the one who stood out for me and never go the attention she deserved was Sharon Warren, who plays Ray's mom. She really reflected the gamut of human emotion in this film and should have been recognized for it. The direction by Taylor Hackford is very tight-knit. The only thing that stops me from giving it a top rating is the relatively fast resolution of all the problems towards the end. Otherwise, a must-see film.",9,0,1,21 March 2005
Prometheus," Above average sci-fi film in the Alien universe (but not making the alien the star)
","I loved 'Alien' and 'Aliens', mainly because of the older, mature cast in different situations: The first Alien was a horror movie, while the second one was an action film.That being said, when going to 'Prometheus', know that it takes place in the universe as Alien/Aliens, but occurs many decades out, on a different planet, and touches on the actual alien itself in passing. I feel that too many viewers are expecting a direct Alien prequel, which it definitely it isn't. Also, I would classify this more as a sci-fi mystery/drama.I actually appreciated this film a lot, as it touches on some pretty interesting concepts from 'Bladerunner' (many reminiscent of Roy Batty's quest to the Tyrell Corporation). The most fascinating character in the film is easily David the android (played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender), whose cool and calculating demeanor are in some ways central to the emotive mirror in the second most fascinating character, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace, who I thought was on par with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley).Special effects and set designs were fantastic. There were many Giger elements in here, and the sets and landscapes were beautiful. I did not see the 3D version, but I may reconsider as there are some beautiful scenes that 3D would have accentuated well. If I had an issue, it would be that the tech shown appeared to be much more polished and advanced than what was seen in Alien/Aliens.As for the story itself, I have seen many reviews ripping on the logic of some characters and their motives as well as some of the scenes. I think a lot of it can be explained away (there is a nice 'FAQ' on this site on the forums explaining the many issues). If I did have a criticism, though, was that the movie was paced a little faster than I expected. I would have really liked hear more of the David/Elizabeth interactions, which would have brought a more intellectual bend to the movie. As for the Lindelof treatment of leaving things hang, I actually do appreciate it. At least that way, I know I am expecting a sequel (I am sure there will be one). I will, however, be let down if the sequel has nothing to do with path followed by the lead characters at the end of the film.Overall, great film. I would recommend those who have not seen at least the first 'Alien' to watch it for some (small) background. I also think that time(and quite possibly the sequels) will determine if it is a great film or not.",8,6,11,10 June 2012
Shall We Dance," Relatively decent remake of the original
","I really had my doubts when I decided to watch this. I had seen the original 'Shall We Dansu', which made more sense in the context in Japanese culture, while presenting itself as a breath of fresh air to the stale climate of the films I have recently been seeing. After watching this version, I can say that the film was relatively straight-forward copy of the original, and the performances were pretty good. Richard Gere does a good job reprising the role of the straight-laced businessman who decides to dance, and the supporting cast (including the always reliable Stanley Tucci) hold the movie well. Jennifer Lopez, surprisingly, has a relatively small role in the film, and while she doesn't butcher the role, she doesn't hold the charm the original actress did. If you can't get ahold of the original, this version will suffice. I think I might have given it a higher rating were it not for a) I did see the original, which puts me at a natural bias, b) a few scenes were too far extended, and c) if they had a more charming actress other than J.Lo in the role of Paulina.",7,0,1,26 February 2005
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Now watch this movie or I shall taunt you for a second time!
","I will preface this by saying that while I'm not a big Monty Python fan, when they get it right, it is brilliant. The show had some great sketches, but some were just bizarre and incomprehensible. The movie is 100% on the mark, starting from the titles with subtitles to its off the wall ending.It would be a disservice to explain the movie and the great scenes in this review. But a few things to note.First, when you take into account that this film was done in 1974, most medieval movies of the time were glamorous set pieces with handsome knights and beautiful princesses. The Pythons skewered this notion completely: Arthur and his knights were commonplace blokes, and the sets were in some muggy, ugly areas. This may have been a budgetary issue, but interestingly enough, they probably depicted medieval England more authentically than even films nowadays.Second, the amount of times the fourth wall is broken are numerous, and just goes to shows how dementedly hilarious the movie gets, but yet still holds the story well.That said, if you have never seen Monty Python (who hasn't?), this is a whole different level of comedy--yes, silly is about right, but not in the crude 'Paul Blart' or 'Larry the Cable Guy' type of silly, but at the same time, not the cerebral 'Dr. Strangelove' type of silliness.Must watch.",10,12,17,14 November 2011
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Mehhhh....
","Saw it with my 4 year old son. New to the Madagascar movies, but you really didn't have to know the background as 5 minutes in this movie will get you up to speed.Overall, I wasn't to impressed (and neither was my son). It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. Many adult oriented jokes (not nasty, just way above a kid's head), some that hit it off, and some which were just OK. My son wanted to leave after 45 minutes because he was bored (I convinced him to stay). Some nice morals in the film.However, was it worth a matinée for me and my child ($13)? I think not. I would have rather rented it at Redbox for a dollar. Even Cars 2, which I felt was more adult oriented, kept my son entertained infinitely better.",5,1,8,10 June 2012
Spectre," Crap-re
","Casino Royale was definitely the Bond film that made Bond interesting again. Great plot, some awesome action scenes, and actors who chew up the scenery, and a back to the basics Bond. Unfortunately, Quantum of Solace went south, but I thought that there was room for recovery. Unfortunately, did not see Skyfall, but got an idea of what happened.That leads us to Spectre. I will cut to the chase: this is reminiscent of the loony Roger Moore Bond films, but with more crazy action scenes, and a plot akin to Moonraker. While there are some great performances from the supporting cast like Ralph Fiennes, Naomi Harris, Ben Whishaw, and even Andrew Scott, the main cast is half-baked at best. Daniel Craig looks tired of playing Bond, while Lea Seydoux is more eye candy, and doesn't add any substance to the film. Waltz as Blofeld basically is a different version of Hans Landa from 'Inglorious Basterds'. Plotwise, it basically is Bond infiltrating Spectre. The relationship between Bond and Blofeld starts out interestingly enough, but instead of fleshing it out, it is left to languish. Coupled with continued appearances from the mean looking David Bautista (who is a mix of Odd Job and Jaws), this Bond film basically languishes into obscurity. Beautiful scenery, and lots of action, but very silly at points. You can check it out if you want to waste some time, but I will leave my good memories with Casino Royale.",5,3,7,14 March 2016
