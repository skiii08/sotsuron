The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Disappointed
","The Hunger Games: Mocking jay-Part 1! The long awaited squeal to the best selling dystopian book series, The Hunger Games. After the success of Harry Potter and Twilight, it seemed like a nice idea to break the final movie of the hunger game series into 2 parts too. But the book isn't that long. Because of that the movie started to drag at moments and the pace of it was slow. But with the amazing cast and widely loved Jennifer Lawrence in it, it's hard not to like. The movie addresses the problem of a stronger government torturing their subjects. Many countries could relate to this today. Overall a good movie. Brilliant acting, well written and really good Cinematography. I personally liked Catching Fire a lot more. The movie primarily set the stage for the final part set to release 20th November next year, kinda like a 2 hour long trailer.The soundtrack by lorde was stunning and perfectly suited the movie.",7,10,25,26 November 2014
The Maze Runner," Ehhh
","The Maze Runner, originally adapted from James Dashner's novel was released on 19 September 2014. I excepted a bit too much from the movie. It starred two actors i really like Dylan O'Brien, from MTV's Teen Wolf and Thomas Brodie- Sangster, from HBO's Game Of Thrones. I haven't read the book but i hear parts of the original novel were missing. But overall it was an okay movie, nothing too special. It's a good watch. The acting was okay. The movie was fast paced didn't drag much. A sequel is set to release,Maze Runner: Scorch Trials, on September 18, 2015.The Maze Runner sequel will include some of the most well known TV actors like Aiden Gillen of Game Of Thrones, Giancarlo Esposito of Breaking Bad and Barry Pepper of Kill The Messenger. Soo looking forward to that.",7,4,6,3 December 2014
