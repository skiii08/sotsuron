Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A Great 2nd Half
","Going into this movie, i heard some bad things. I heard that the first one was better and this one wasn't even close to being good. But i did hear also good things. So I went into the theater with a bit of concern. I probably should have rented the first one to get my mind into the new one but I knew enough still to be pumped up. When the title Kill Bill came on the screen though, I got goosebumps. And After 2 hours and a half, I must say this movie was great. Its a very different movie than the last though. The first volume was all about fighting and sword play and good action which was still a very good flick. The second one is mostly smart talk and diologue. But its so great though. Its a great film by itself. I like it better than the first half. Thats just me though. It still had good action when it was needed so don't worry. The only thing I did not like about Kill Bill 2 was that the previews showed what Bill looks like. I wish they would have saved it for the movie. Thats the only downfall. But overall I came out of the theater really happy and excited about it. I give it 9.5/10.",Null,1,2,27 April 2004
The Girl Next Door," Great Flick.....May have some small spoilers
","The Girl Next Door was a great flick. Even though the storyline is a but unbelieveable but it could happen in the world today. But this flick is very good. Its got smart dialogue, and overall a very good script. The acting i thought was pretty good for some unknown casting. I always hated how in teen comedy movies, the characters in highschool were played by people in their mid 20's and looked nothing like regular high school kids. But in this movie, the high school kids look pretty realistic to real life. Of course like any other movie it has its faults. Just when u thought the movie was ending, something always occured to make the story last longer. It wasn't a bad thing but it happen a couple times. Overall it was a very entertaing flick that i would see again. It's probably one of the best movies of the year that will of course be under rated. 9/10",9,1,1,23 April 2004
The Village," A Very Good Flick Which People See The Wrong Way
","Some people just cannot appreciate a good film. M. Night, is a very good director with his own style. People tend to look at whats realistic and need an action sense, but really anyone with an intelligent mind who goes to the movies looking for inspiration and looking at all the details of the movie such as acting, script, direction, and production value can appreciate this film. All of M. Nights flicks are not meant to be realistic. They are fantasy and drama and what ifs. M.Night is a great director and I have always loved his own sense of style to his films. People these days just cannot realize when a good movie comes out. Star Wars, a very unrealistic Trilogy took the globe in the box office and crowds loved it. But possibly times are changing towards watching realistic movies but movies are meant for art and to take people away from the real world and put them in the directors mind.I give this movie 9/10. It is a very intense good flick that makes people think which most people do not like and love to be entertained with explosions. Well this film is not an action flick. Its a drama/romantique/thriller, with plot twists that are well thought of and give the crowd something to really think about. The acting is top notch, production values are great, directing is great, and the script is well written. Lots of deep intellectual conversations, just like of all M. Night's Films. If you like his past films, you will like this.9/10",Null,0,0,2 August 2004
