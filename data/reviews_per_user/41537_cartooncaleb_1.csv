Who Framed Roger Rabbit," This is lightning in a bottle!
","We will never see another movie like this ever again. So many animation/live-action hybrids have happened before this movie and many tried to capture the success of this movie, but none of them will live up to the masterpiece that is Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The techniques to how they've combined live action footage and animation under the brilliant direction of Robert Zemeckis and Richard Williams is astounding, especially how they did not use the computer technology we have today. Not only that, but the fact that you see all your favorite cartoon characters that have stood the test of time all in this one film. Right down to having Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny together at the same time, the likes of this kind of crossover will never be seen again. Even without those gimmicks, the movie is still an incredibly funny, heartwarming story about a man learning to stop taking out his depression in unhealthy ways and how to laugh again. The characters are lovable and unforgettable, the story is engaging and tightly-woven together, the music is great, and of course, the animation is groundbreaking. If you are fan of animation, this is mandatory viewing. Even if you're just a casual film fan, this is still worth a watch just to see what it's all about. It's a great loony ride, and I'm proud to call it my favorite movie of all time. That's all folks!",10,3,3,3 April 2018
