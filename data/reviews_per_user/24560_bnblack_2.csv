Sucker Punch," Best movie of the new year so far!!!!!!!! (and sets the bar pretty high)
","SUCKER PUNCH IS A SOLID 9.5 in my book. The visuals are out of this world. It is like Transformers fun to look at, but not too deep and way less offensive to its viewing audience. I would say it is the world's best music video. Great music choices like The Pixies only add to strength. Perfect movie for 13 year old boys and girls. Our anyone who is still young at heart with a vivid imagination. Great stuff in my opinion. If the Force is strong in you than see it. If not may I suggest alien abduction of maternal ancestors, a wimpy movie about a wimpy kid, or bunnies that poop jelly beans. For me SUCKER PUNCH, clearly is the best film since Inception including all the Oscar stuff. For me it lived up to the hype and then some.BNBLACK Sent on the Sprint® Now Network from my BlackBerry®",10,2,7,30 March 2011
Spider-Man 3," Amazing.
","Awesome Best Spiderman Yet. And one of the best Superhero movies ever, much better than the disappointing x3 or superman returns. Also much better than the likes of Daredevil, Electra, Hulk, and Punisher, I DON'T like Spiderman as a general concept, he is way to much of a whiny kid to me both in the comic and in the first two movies. I really disliked the first film and felt there was not enough action in the second, way to much whining about MJ and 'I don't want to be Spiderman.'Now to finally see him not only except his role as Spiderman and then be a bad ass, granted a little EMO was cool. It reminded me of the now modern Superhero classic of Batman Begins. Although Maguire did ham it up a little, it is a kids movie after all, and that is to be expected. But as with the first two the saving graces are the villains really good choices, the villains this go around are all really cool and well fleshed out, and just kick ass to watch. And the balancing of the 3 villains was amazing and very well done storytelling. Not to mention killer effects,Venom was very well done and the Sandman was incredible especially at the end.B",10,1,5,6 May 2007
