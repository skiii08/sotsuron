The Blair Witch Project," I could have done that
","If I had know that all it took to make a movie which would gross more than 100 million dollars was to take three kids and make them camp put in the woods for a couple of nights and make scary stick figures, hey I would have done it a long time ago. This movie gave me a headache. Not because it was bad (which it was), but because the directors let the actors do all the filming and they didn't know how to hold a camera straight.This movie left me confused and disorientated. I don't want to think about what it did to kids that were high and watched it. The only scary thing about this movie was that it made so much money and has spawned an upcoming sequel and prequel. Lets hope that the new one's have more class than this one, and also make more sense.",Null,0,0,27 April 2000
Alien 3," Not a bad movie
",I really enjoyed this movie very much. Sigourney Weaver was fantastic as always and the ending will leave you stunned. The acting is done well but there are a few holes in the story which only scenes that were cut out will fill in. This movie has gotten a lot of bad things said about it but its not as bad as some people made it out to be. You should give it a try if you haven't seen it.,Null,0,3,28 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A real ride
","Star Wars Episode 1 is a great start to the new Star Wars Trilogy. This movie has the best special effects of any movie I have ever seen and the story is a great too. The lightsaber battle between the two Jedi and the Sith is the best part. George Lucus gives the viewers of this movie what he gave viewers almost 25 years ago, and that is a movie masterpiece that will last for years to come.",Null,0,0,29 April 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Sigourney Weaver does it again
",Once again Sigourney Weaver stars in another wonderful Alien movie. One thing that makes the Ailen movies so great is you get characters that you like or hate and each movie has its own special features. This one is another example of what makes a good Alien movie a Good Alien movie. This time around you see Sigourney Weaver's character Ripley as a not so nice girl. Weaver does some great acting in this film and I strongly suggest people to see it.,Null,0,0,28 April 2000
Alien," Wonderful
",This is the first movie of a great series. A crew on a spaceship is being hunted by a creature that has acid for blood and kills on sight. I know what your thinking its just another sci-fi Alien movie but its not. This movie is an original classic and the effects are great. Check this baby out.,Null,0,1,28 April 2000
Aliens," Could be the greatest movie of all time
",This sequel to the very wonderful movie Alien is better than the first. This movie is a mixture of action and science fiction and does very well mixing the two together. The effects in this movie are great and the big final scene between Sigourney Weaver and a Queen Alien is memorible. Check this movie out if you haven't already. Its a killer.,Null,0,0,28 April 2000
Man on the Moon," Jim Carrey's best
",I have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of Andy Kaufman but after I saw this movie Jim Carrey kind of opened my eyes to Andy's creativness. This movie is a real eye opener and should be seen by everyone who enjoys a good comedy and drama too.,Null,0,0,22 June 2000
The Game," Great Movie
",The Game is a great movie that never quits and its a good thing it doesn't because that just would have made the movie suck. I could not keep my eyes off the screen as soon as it started and the ending will leave you speechless. Rent it or buy it as long as you see it.,Null,0,1,29 April 2000
Titanic," What a piece of crap this was
","I must be the only person on Earth who hated this movie. It was long and boring. If you can stand sitting for 3 and a half hours just watching Leonardo Dicaprio complain because he's in love with a girl thats too classy for him, then this is the movie for you. The only reason this made so much money was because of that Dicaprio guy and not the fact it was a good movie. If you want to see a good movie that involves a ship sinking at the end, watch Jaws. At least that had excitement. I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen >",Null,4,7,29 April 2000
Scream 2," Great sequel
","This is a great sequel to the first one. I found that this was very creative and like the first one, kept you guessing on who the killer really was, and when you found out who, you were shocked. Wes Craven has proven that he can make sequels and do a damn fine job at it too.",Null,0,0,27 April 2000
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Makes Romeo and Juliet look like crap
",This is by far the greatest love story ever told. The romance in this movie is beyond belief. I wanted dracula to get the girl because the actor made us believe that he was really in love with her. The acting in great the plot is great and the movie is great. See this movie you wont be sorry you did.,Null,0,0,28 April 2000
Scream," Great start for a great trilogy
",This movie comes in second as the best horror movie of all time (Halloween being the first). This movie gives you characters that you can relate to and scream with. Wes Craven does a perfect job directing this fine movie. Corteney Cox and David Arquette have great chemestry together and Neve Campbell is great as a young girl that is being stalked by a ghost face killer. A wonderful movie at best. Check it out if you haven't seen it already.,Null,0,0,27 April 2000
Halloween," The King Of Horror Movies
",Halloween is one of those great horror movies that comes along once but every 20 years. I must say that this movie is still scary and great after almost 22 years. Jamie Lee Curtis is at her best as a baby-sitter that is hunted by a psychopath on Halloween. Don't watch this one alone. I give this movie a 10/10 all the way.,Null,0,0,27 April 2000
The Silence of the Lambs," My second all time favorite movie
",This movie is one of the best movies of the 20 century. This movie keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats until the ending credits. Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster give great performences and the director gives us 100% of good movie making. This movie gets a 10 out of 10.,Null,0,0,17 May 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The best of its time
",This movie was made during a time when every movie studio in the world was trying to rip off 'Halloween' and horror movie fans were in for a treat when this very original movie came out. A man with a burned face and knifes for fingers enters the dreams of teens to get his revenge on the parents that killed him years back. Wes Craven has written a marvelous script and directed a marvelous movie. Robert Englund is great as the scary Freddy Kruger. A classic movie so check it out.,Null,0,0,29 April 2000
