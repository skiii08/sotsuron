Blade Runner 2049," Well-developed character-driven sci-fi - a unique rendering of a classic
","The original Blade Runner film remains one of my most favorite sci-fi films of all-time, so I was really looking forward to the remake. At first, it seemed slow, over-developed, but then as the film progressed, I began to appreciate the pace. This is one of those rare finds in science fiction films coming out of Hollywood, where the character is dominant to the action or special-effects. In fact, the special effects in this remake are nothing to gawk at. A very dark and morose setting for the Los Angeles of 2049, with some flybys with futurist cars, but overall, the story is what carries this film and Gosling's performance is touching. One feels his pain and desperation to find his relevance in a post-apocalyptic world, and I loved his association with his holographic computer, and their special bond. Overall, it's a long movie, but it taps on the doors of our inner emotion; and on both sides of the story, the human sense of entitlement to survive above all other species, including even those they created too well; and the Replicants, the engineered Ai cybernetics, who simply want a chance to become everything they can be.",8,1,6,8 October 2017
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A solid performance
","For number three in the series, this was good. It was a solid performance by all concerned, and in fact, I consider it Jennifer Lawrence's most mature. Her acting was real, except in a few places where they obviously inflated her reactions to engender more emotional impact, an unfortunate downside to Hollywood - but otherwise, this show wasn't about the special effects nor even the action, rather, it focused more on the humanity and her vulnerability. It sets the stage for a good sequel, and for sure, by this point, as much I like Donald Sutherland, I hope to see him and his capital city leveled to the ground. It's time for justice.",8,0,7,28 March 2015
Child 44," A tough watch but a brilliant job by all concerned
","Child 44 isn't the movie you watch for light entertainment. It is gritty and tough, and I found myself feeling a sense of absolute disgust for anyone and anything connected with the old school communist state in the USSR. It really makes you look at just how bad that system was and how monstrous the people were who enforced it on the general populace. Nonetheless, the story is compelling, although sometimes the thread jumps around a bit. Tom Hardy's performance was his best ever. I think he warrants an Academy for it. Noomi Rapace was excellent - very authentic in her role. Child 44 is a dark thriller - and without giving anything away, the build up and hatred toward the serial killer really sticks you to this movie - you simply want the killer to get the most gruesome death conceivable for what he does. Apart from the Hollywood aspect, this film depicts reality. This is how life existed under Communism and I think that message is just as compelling and important as the rest of the story - because it really depicted the terror and the suppression that millions of people lived under in the name of some douche bag's idea of 'ideology'. May Stalin forever lay dead and remembered for only one thing - he was a murdering asshole. Watch the film folks - I notice that the ratings were low, and I think that is an unfair assessment about the quality of this production.",8,113,156,3 October 2015
Fury," Excellent rendering
","This was an excellent rendering of life in a war zone. It defies the propaganda war films which came out post-World War II which portrayed the glory of it all. The characterizations were believable. The internal conflicts that the Fury (the 5 man tank-team) experienced, fighting to survive in a brutal war where humankind murdered one another, all the while challenged by their own basic goodness, was compelling. Brad Pitt's performance was his most mature. Fury is on the same level as Band of Brothers - showing that when a high caliber bullet hits a man's head, it disappears. It's horrific, but real. And like the film Platoon, one of the best renderings about the Vietnam conflict, Fury also helps to debunk the 'glory' of war, demonstrating that innocence is one of its first victims, and showing it for what it really is - insanity with a uniform.",8,2,8,15 March 2015
Point Break," Terrible - mostly just extreme sports
","This movie was terrible. It had the signature trademark of a brand of Hollywood films which are shallow and which focus on sexy girls and being 'cool' and 'dangerous' but in fact, none of the characters were believable or authentic and there was no character build-up and no sense of empathy for them. Without giving a spoiler, the 'bad' guys that the FBI agent is trying to expose actually have a good reason for what they are doing - but it is completely misplaced in the plot and it has nothing to do with the original thematic thread of the original make of this movie. The lead actor simply doesn't act. He's just a sporty-guy. There was some good extreme sports scenes, but nothing more than one might find on YouTube, otherwise, bad acting, boring and trite plot. The original make of this movie with Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze was the cream. Too bad because there are a few decent names in this new rendering. Anyhow, I hate to be so negative about it but I literally couldn't watch it anymore after about 40 minutes into the film and I had been looking forward to seeing this movie.",1,1,2,2 June 2016
Hidden Figures," An excellent rendering and spotlight on an important part of history
","Hidden Figures is an an excellent rendering and spotlight on a piece of the NASA space program which was not formerly broad knowledge. The fact that these African-American women played such a critical role in shaping the entire space program and getting people into space, and to the moon, is finally a matter of acknowledged history. The film does a very good job of presenting the context and ambient feel of the times, as NASA is racing to get ahead of the curve before the Russians dominate space, while at the same time, the civil rights movement to eliminate racial discrimination in America is also reaching epic proportions. There is a nice balance of technology and ethnicity presented, and one also feels not only the passion of these women to succeed in both a man's world and a racially discriminate one, but the passion to rise above the black-white threshold imposed by an ignorant and prejudicial culture. All performers did a fine job of presenting realistic characters and because the film is based on reality, and real people, it leaves one with a sense of inspiration about the courage and drive of these principled and under-acknowledged women.",9,1,4,29 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Best of the Star Wars franchise
","The Last Jedi is, in my humble opinion, the best of the Star Wars franchise. I saw trailers of the first Star Wars film even before it hit the big screen back in the 70's, and that one I felt held the title, until now. This story is overall well-developed, and I really liked that they built up the character of Luke Skywalker and made him very relevant again after so many years with him missing from the films. There is good emotion, heartfelt, and the fight scenes with Ben Solo are gritty and angry and filled with a lot of passion. Overall, I feel that the creators and the actors put a real nice spin on this ball, giving the viewer and life-long fans, such as myself, closure on aspects of the this story which have been hanging there for decades. And, no spoilers, it's set up for more sequels.",9,1,2,19 December 2017
Logan," Hugh Jackman's best performance yet
","Logan is the darkest of the X-Men/Wolverine series. Thankfully, it is more realistic than its predecessors. When Wolverine cuts loose there is blood and split heads and body parts flying all over the place - instead, as with earlier series, one barely saw a blood spatter. Logan is dark because Wolverine is battling himself in this rendering more so than ever. He doesn't want be what he has become and the battle that rages inside is killing him. Without spoiling the movie, a surprise player appears and she gives Logan a new injection of life and purpose. The fighting scenes are pretty thrilling, the twists are good, but for reasons which are inexplicable the creator decided to enter a short segment with a bunch of young kids living alone in the wilderness, happily surviving on hot dogs, smiling and all clean and normal, like, 'What!!?' as if they had all the luxuries of life in the middle of nowhere!!! That one small segment was like injecting some scene from the Wizard of Oz into the middle of Platoon. Nonetheless, Logan delivers up. It is heartfelt and Jackman delivers his best performance ever. His acting is sincere, the pain he feels, you feel, and the conflict that roils through him to the last scene of the movie is indelible until the end. But please, no more Wizard of Oz - this is real life, lots of killing and blood... I mean, duh.",8,1,5,25 March 2017
"McFarland, USA"," An inspiring film about dreaming high
","McFarland, USA, is an excellent and inspiring film. One cannot help but see the film, a depiction of a true story, as a reflection of the American dream, and it is certainly that, considering that it is a story about a group of boys, living in an Hispanic farming community, who, with the help of their coach (Kostner) become champions in their field of running. Besides the warmth, humanity and principled aspect of the film, it touches on this contemporary subject of the American dream, can anyone actually live it, and of course, Kostner proves to these kids that they can. This dream is not only shared in America, it is shared by everyone, in every nation because the American dream is nothing more than the potential to dream high, and to have the opportunity to achieve it, and that message resonates throughout the movie. The ending is extremely touching - but no spoilers. The film should be required watching for any elected officials - reminding them why they are in office and who they serve.",9,1,2,9 December 2017
Steve Jobs," An excellent presentation showing how Steve Jobs really changed the world
","This was an excellent presentation of how Steve Jobs stuck to his guns and his dreams and refused to give up in the face of incredible odds. Where his friends and associates turned on him, he refused to turn on himself. The movie gave enough balance in terms of his personal life, his weaknesses, and most importantly, his undying determination to change the world through personal computers. Steve Jobs was a people's man, in reality. He wanted the power of computers put into the hands of every living person on Earth, and that passion carried his dream into reality and helped him to overcome all the road blocks put in his way. It's an inspiring life and the movie captured it well. Definitely recommend watching it.",8,0,0,14 June 2016
Unbroken," An excellent rendering of one man's refusal to give up on life
","Unbroken is an excellent movie. Well made, moving and very realistic. I loved the mantra 'If you can take it - you can make it' - and what this man goes through to survive the Pacific Theater during World War II - and to beat his main adversary, a cowardly Japanese prison camp official who does everything in his power to break him - is an inspiration. I highly recommend the film. Kudos to Angelina Jolie for a finely directed film. This quality of film is rare for Hollywood - as it's strength was based on characters and human qualities - not green screens and CGI. And one last thing - having flown planes before, the aerial scenes are great - very compelling, very realistic. Just see it.",8,1,1,19 July 2015
