The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," How to level the brain hemispheres of young humans
","Nothing happens in this movie. From the very beginning you get the clear feeling that you should adore Katniss, or care about her - this is ALL that happens in the movie. We get to look at her blank, emotionless, stale expressions that only change once through the movie.And that's only when she laments over that idiot week-kneed Peeta, while she avoids Thor's brother, a guy who is WAY WAY WAY better looking and smarter and more common-sensed...But what scenario, and what tastes, and what story can we expect from a plagiarist? Brainless authors can only generate no-brainers...This proved to be worse than Twilight - and that says a lot...",1,27,40,27 November 2014
Captain America: Civil War," The Avengers cow is nearly comatose - from exaggerated milking...
","I've made up my mind (although I thought this before, but I've forgotten): Marvel movies (aside from X-Men) are for little kids, nerds, immature boys... you get the point. The first Avengers was... okay (there was SOMETHING in there that just didn't 'click'... something broken... something forced... something very, very cheap... like it shouted 'IT'S AN Imitation!!!' from a distance. And indeed, if anyone remembers, Avengers were made AFTER The Justice League... a mere copy... a pale replica... a teenage-nerdy attempt to create a rival universe... But everything in this universe seems to be very poorly inspired... and sustained by tongue-in-cheek jokes that offer a very short relief every now and then... So many Marvel fanboys have 'demolished' Batman V Superman (which was a FAR superior movie... artistically made)... well... boys... if you like your puppet toys of Cap America and Iron Man... no one will forbid you to play with them as much as your kiddie heart pleases... but when you grow up you will desire a different kind of movies... and then you'll understand Snyder's version of a more mature superhero movie... Tonight I wanted to leave the theater ... but because it's an IMAX theater i tormented myself into remaining till the very end... It was a silly, poorly-scripted, miserably-put-together attempt of milking money from people... Absolutely NOTHING aroused my interest... didn't care about any of the characters... (literally!!!) - in short: LAME - LAME - LAME!!! I swore to myself i will never see any Avengers-related movie again... this cow is almost comatose... of how much they milked it already... It would be humane to finally let it rest in piece... But they're too profit-oriented to listen to the wisdom that says 'retire while still in full glory' (even now it's too late for them anyway...)",1,34,69,11 May 2016
The Fault in Our Stars," Artificial movie for an idiotic generation...
","8.5 on IMDb?!??! Seriously?!?!?!You can rate this movie SO high... if you wanna be stimulated emotionally in a gratuitous manner + if your IQ level is REALLY low + if you like actors who can't act and look absolutely artificial on the screen (what the heck happened to Laura Dern? she used to be a slightly better actor... now she looks like she's joined the ranks of the completely artificialized Americans... fake smiles, fake emotions; those kids act completely unrealistic also... this is NOT how people who will die from cancer would behave...). Have someone on the BIG screen cry for a few minutes... the audience will cry too, of course. It's like the yawning that's contagious... But why was it that I didn't care at all for ANY of the characters, by the end of the movie?... The only moment that was a bit moving was when the girl received the news about his death... But even that wasn't connected emotionally to anything else in the movie... I can list a hundred movies that are WAY more emotional than this pile of artificial cr*p... And what the f**k is with that pack of cigarettes on the boy's coffin? I know cigarettes eventually PUT you in the coffin, but his was not the case... I wonder what message they wanted to convey to the viewers...",1,111,230,16 June 2014
Limitless," Plain awful - naked propaganda for drugs
","I give this movie a 1 (NOT A 0!) only because some of its cinematic was innovative (the tunnel-vision effects).However, regarding fully developed brain capacity... well... the movie understood NOTHING. Even Einstein had more brain than this drugged dude who's the lead actor. And Einstein's brain wasn't fully developed.It's simply a propaganda for drugs. Unless you're a drug addict, or plan to be in the near future, i suggest you see something else.What happened to the movies of 10-20 years ago (Miami Vice, Beverly Hills Cop, etc)? when everybody knew that drugs are BAD, and the guys dealing drugs are the VILLAINS... and the cops were the good guys, trying to stop the spread of the drug-evil... Who infiltrated your brain, people, and made you accept all these things? ALL OF THE SUDDEN... VAMPIRES ARE COOL... DRUGS ARE COOL... everything that leads to death is cool?... IS MANKIND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE NOWADAYS OR WHAT?...Ponder a bit on these things... Then maybe you'll start using your brain capacity more than you have until now... (for those who like this movie)",1,23,63,23 April 2011
Beauty and the Beast," Horrible!!! Horrible!!! Horrible!!!
","In a world... where originality and creativity has gone down the drain... (because of too many mushrooms and weed smoked) even the mighty Disney empire has been plagued by mediocre and sub-mediocre unintelligent people who decided to put their few neurons to work - and created this utter nonsensical useless boring dull uninspired (and very much expired) piece of sh**. So they chose an actress who had relations up there - because this is how things often worked in Hollywood - but in spite of their efforts to auto-tune her voice and dress her in colorful stuff, she still damaged the image of the original Belle of Disney. A broomstick up her a$$, her reactions were so much more unemotional than those of the petrified castle servants... & the beast? absolutely horrendous to watch, also pretty much wooden... and an insult to the original cartoon of 1991 WHO STILL REMAINS ONE OF DISNEY'S MASTERPIECES(from a time when the minds and hearts of people making movies there were less affected by darkness).It's best to revisit the old masterpieces. I am afraid of how the future rehashes will look...",1,6,11,13 June 2017
It Chapter Two," An homage to human mental degradation
","Watching this 'movie', you see how much society has degraded, how some human beings (like this director) can vomit their mental sickness and make a film advertised as a blockbuster.
Almost 3 hours of your life that you will never get back. But if you really wanna see it, wait for the online version. I thought IMAX would make it worth seeing... I was so wrong...",1,12,24,10 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Completely useless remake - CGI fest for the brain-dead
","This movie is a completely useless remake of a King Kong movie - the monkey is uglier (but if you look at it close-up through a lens it looks scarier, right? - wrong!) They replaced the T-Rex-es with a different kind of creatures that perhaps look scarier if they throw them at you in 3D, or in 4DX, when they splash you with water at the same time... And, yes, for the 4DX viewing this is a good 'ride' - when the monsters fight the chairs are moving intensely and you're splashed and sprayed and rained with water and air and scents... it's a good amusement park ride. But other than that, in the moments when the actors... 'act' (do they?!)... this movie is pure boredom. A 5-year old would have written a better script. None of the actors matter, none stick with you (other than, maybe, the American chick in tank top who shows she's got some boobs and that's why they put her there) So, if you need a 4DX ride and you can do something else when there's no monsters fighting on the screen, see the movie. If you'll see it in plain 3D or IMAX... you'll be really sorry you wasted the money. Honestly. PS Who the f**k is paying a**holes to make the rating look so high for dumb movies like this? and write pompous reviews?... Are they smoking something?... A Dog's Purpose got a 3-4 in his opening week, although it was a fun, warmhearted movie, just because PETA got upset with some nonsense stuff (human actors are way more traumatized during filming than that dog who was just being put into the water) - and dumb movies like this one have 7-8 scores?!?! So IMDb is clearly manipulated... You can't rely on the ratings here anymore...",2,15,31,11 March 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Unexpected? not really
","In a time when cr*p is considered art, this movie may be indeed 'art'. When you forget what Art is (namely, the search for Beauty), anything that's strange, anything that looks weird, any movie that's unlike the majority of movies, is considered 'artistic', and may be a candidate for awards... Let's just film a lot in one shot... and call ourselves artistic artists... shall we?...And this, my friends, is what ignorance is.Is this a virtue? You know it's not... The very word 'virtue' stands for something completely different.Is this unexpected? If you've lived with your eyes open for the past 10 years, it won't surprise you as something unexpected - the general trend has been to numb people's minds and to get them into darker places, to anesthetize them to the real values, to the real virtues, to the real Beauty, to the real Art.",1,2,4,11 March 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," THE BEST Superhero Movie of All Times !!
","Although the first time I saw it some of the parts of the movie seemed to not 'flow' harmoniously, the second time it all made perfect sense!... This is one beautifully crafted, directed with a lot of heart, superbly shot masterpiece of a movie!!! It takes the superhero genre to a whole different level, higher, more complex (than your silly Avengers with the silly Stan Lee cameos), with mythological and religious references (because where else would you go with this kind of movies?). People have complained that superhero movies don't have character development - now that this movie has achieved this almost perfectly they complain that it's too long. Others complain there's too many explosions, Michael Bay stuff... others that it's not enough Batman fighting Superman (the director put 'v' instead of 'vs' exactly to emphasize that!)... others that they don't do justice to this or that... Well - i've seen people in the theater scrolling on their phones and making noise and walking around during the movie - which shows they didn't actually WANT to be there and actually see the movie. THESE are the people who write bad reviews for this movie. People with short attention span, people who aren't used to using their neurons too much, just mindlessly watching something different than reality (exclusive Marvel fans with a one-track mind), people who don't appreciate classical literature (Greek dramas, Shakespeare, etc.) - these types of people will naturally write bad reviews - BECAUSE THIS MOVIE SURPASSES THEIR LEVEL OF COMPREHENSION. It makes them THINK - it makes them understand symbolism... and this is something they're not used to. Therefore they're angry. (and for some of those people, just a reminder: Marvel is a copy of the DC universe. Or a distant nephew... DC was founded in 1938 - Marvel in 1960)This movie is a masterpiece in portraying these iconic characters in a new light - its action is superb, its build-up towards a magnificent finale is flawless, and its ending, especially the final second... is THE BEST ENDING IN MOVIE HISTORY. Zack has been really clever in premiering this movie on the Good Friday - if you understand the symbolism in the last part of the movie, you CANNOT but LOVE this superb masterpiece.",10,6,11,27 March 2016
