Sucker Punch," Shocked my expectations
","I went to see this film with a few friends earlier, and it wasn't the film I wanted to see. I'm a girl and although I love action movies, I just did not really fancy this one. I really wanted to see something else, however my friend really wanted to see this. So, I went in expecting it to be quite bad to be honest. From start to end though I was glued! It had a great storyline (if you could pick up on it as it can be confusing at first).Basically, I loved this film and I am so glad I went to see it. However, my friend who actually wanted to see it thought it was rubbish and not worth going to see. So, although I do personally think it is great, I don't think that everyone will love it. If you are going to see it for great action scenes constantly throughout then this film is not for you. It has a great storyline and it takes us through it however you have to be willing to be taken along with it, otherwise you will not enjoy it.I would recommend people to go and see it, just make sure you are willing to actually watch it.",8,3,7,6 April 2011
Source Code," Absolutely Amazing; worth the money.
","I'll be honest - I only really went to see this film because of Jake Gyllenhaal. I knew a bit about the film but if it wasn't for him I probably would not have went the cinema to see it. However, I am so glad that I did!! This film is amazing and completely worth watching. It is a bit confusing at first but it all makes sense once it goes along. Some people may get a bit bored of it I think but those are people who are too impatient to really understand what a real, decent film is.I would highly recommend that anyone who is deciding whether or not to go and see it does; you will most likely love it. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can buy it and watch it again. Best movie I have seen in a while!!",10,1,1,13 April 2011
The Hunger Games," What I expected and more ...
","From the moment I read the books, and then found out there was going to be a film I have been excited to see The Hunger Games. The wait was worth it, and I cannot express how much this film moved me. I was always expecting it to be good, because of the books. However, it was better than I expected! The characters were portrayed excellently especially Katniss. The settings were perfect and exactly how I had imagined when reading the books. There were a few let downs but very minor ones at that; a few changes to how things should have happened and a few things missed out that I thought should have been in there. However, it is only meant to be a film based on the book - they can't get it one hundred percent the same as the book and therefore I don't really complain about these minor faults. I would say to everyone - GO AND WATCH THE HUNGER GAMES. Whether you heard the whole 'Team Gale, Team Peeta' thing about this film - ignore that. This movie is about so much more than a romantic relationship between two characters. It is such a moving film and those people who bring it down to that 'team' argument are not giving it any justice and making it sound like a stupid meaningless film like 'Twilight'.So, don't be put off by thinking it's about the whole 'team Gale or Peeta' ... I promise you it is not and that you will most likely thoroughly enjoy this film (unless you wanted the team love thing).Overall, outstanding film.",10,6,21,23 March 2012
Bridesmaids," Such a let down for me
","I can see that many people obviously loved this film Bridesmaids, but I found the complete opposite! I expected a hilarious film which was basically 'the female version of the hangover', but it was not at all.The humour was not consistent throughout. Yes there were bits that I did find very amusing, however it was only certain parts and not enough to keep me entertained.I don't have high expectations for films usually but this really disappointed me :/ I think the storyline was a good idea and I can see were the potential is for it. However, it wasn't fulfilled. So much more could have been done with it and I am shocked that the director did not. With more work this could have been the amazing film it is meant to be, which it sadly is not.",1,6,9,28 July 2011
Taken," Wow.
","I can't believe it took me so long to watch this film! It had never caught my eye until a friend gave me it to watch. I am so happy they did, as this is now one of my favourite films. The acting from Liam Neeson is perfect. He plays his part so well, and makes this film what it is.The action scenes throughout are great and not too fake or 'cheesy' as I sometimes find with some films. The storyline is also very good and is very moving.One of the main things I loved about Taken, is the fact that it doesn't take too long to get into it. The beginning is good and kept me interested unlike some films which just take too long to get into, with a very boring start. I am so happy I finally watched this film, and would recommend anyone thinking of, to do so as soon as possible. Definitely worth it!",10,1,2,4 February 2012
August Rush," Not what I expected at all
","This movie is so amazing and very emotional. I watched the trailer for it and the movie itself is not what I really expected it to be - in a good way. I don't know what I did expect, but it certainly was not the storyline itself. It is a meaningful film and I never knew about it until now, and movies like this should be praised so much more than what they are.I think it is a film that can be watched by all and even enjoyed by all. The ending - spectacular. I love how this movie does not just hand us everything on a plate, we have to work some things out as we go along. This film is great and I am so glad I got to see it and I really would recommend it to anyone. I wish there were many more films like this, and I do hope to see more.",7,1,1,24 February 2011
Fast Five," Amazing
","I have loved these films ever since they first came out and when I saw that there was a fifth one I was so excited! I was hoping that it was going to be as amazing as the past ones, and it is. This newest film is actually one of the best and definitely worth watching. I am a girl and I love these movies. It's not because of Vin Diesel or Paul Walker - I love the cars and the action. These films never disappoint and certainly not this one. Without trying to ruin the film - there are a few shocks, but you will only understand them if you have seen the other films. I really advise anyone to go watch this film, you will not regret it! The action is as great as usual and the cars are still amazing too. The humour is still good, if better than usual.",10,5,13,23 April 2011
