United 93," Important Film
","I think this movie will be important for future generations who have not had the immediate first-hand accounts and experiences our generation has had of that awful day. And this movie certainly captured those 'moments' in real time very effectively as if the events were actually unfolding before our eyes. And the key element to the whole 9/11 events was 'time'...and it's even more-so now in the post 9/11 times.Of course as a movie...it needs to make money to cover the costs of making it in the first place. But I don't think 'making money' was the sole purpose of making of this film.The events that happened on that flight was unprecedented I think...it's the only one where the passengers were able to assess the situation from cell-phone calls made to relay up-to-the minute information about WTC and Pentagon, realizing to the passengers that they were on a suicide mission. They knew the evil they were facing, and they knew their fate. And the most gut-wrenching part was the fact that most passengers had time to call their loved ones and say goodbye for the last time. That's too real for words. I believe that the contact with the loved ones in the plane gave the passengers incentive, motivation and strength to plan the attack against the hijackers so that they can back to their families. The evil in that plane was real and palpable....as is the evil that was happening in New York that day...and the passengers chose to become fierce warriors to fight against it.We must face this evil...whether we like it or not...it must be dealt with...just like what happened on that flight. It's a hard fact....a hard truth....just as 9/11 was a hard truth...but we can't look away. We must know this evil before we can even begin to destroy it.It was a hard fact on that plane that day.....and to watch this movie might help to come to grips with the reality of this evil that actively exists in this world today....because we know the painful outcome of that flight can not be changed. We have to accept that their fate was due to an act of pure evil, done to us as well, collectively as a nation. We most certainly are at war...to deny that would be foolish, damaging and insulting to the memories of those who died for our nation on that day.",10,1,3,25 September 2006
