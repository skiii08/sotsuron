Scarface," An operatic display of violence
","I remember seeing this movie in the theaters with my mom when I was 10. Even though she knew the level of violence in this movie, she still took me because we were living in Miami at the time during the cocaine cowboys era. I was completely shocked by the violence, the profanity, and the drug use in the film. It's a terrific film that doubles as a morality tale. Al Pacino's depiction as Tony Montana is terrific. At times you almost forget he's really Italian. He is great at showing us how the game is played in the drug business. What you should do, what to avoid and, most of all, never want more than what you need.In short, this is a terrific gangster film.9 out of 10",9,0,2,23 December 2014
The Butterfly Effect," One word..........WOW!
","I saw this movie out of curiosity. I wanted to see how this 'time travel' film adheres to the Ray Bradbury story of the same name. It did a great job, so good that it spooked me at times as he tries to initially alter one event and winds up changing another. Sometimes its good, other times it's horrific. you keep watching to see how it pans out and after a while u wonder if this is all in his mind. The ending is great (regardless of whichever you see), and it was well acted. This is easily Ashton kutcher's best movie. Maybe he should do more horror or thriller films in the future.I give this movie a 7 out of 10. Not the best film I ever saw, bet still a gem of a film.",Null,0,0,22 July 2011
Lord of War," Cage at his best
","This film was recommended to me by a friend when it his DVD. I watched it and was amazed by the things depicted in the film, some cool, some bizarre, some tragic, yet completely entertaining from start to finish.Nic Cage's performance in this film is terrific, in my opinion, much more tragic than his role from Leaving Las Vegas. You love him and hate him, cheer him, and root against him for the path he chooses. His choice to become an arms dealer comes as a kind of destiny he feels he was born to fulfill.I like how his character always manages to stay one step ahead of the law while juggling his family life. His choices are not always morally correct, yet he is aware and makes no apologies.Please see this movie if you have a chance. After you watch it, watch it with director's commentary. The director has a lot of good stuff to tell about the movie, from how he got the financing to the actors he hired for certain roles.",8,1,1,12 March 2013
Platoon," Terrific
","I was expecting to see just a typical war movie with a lot of action. I couldn't believe the film I saw; it was quite possibly the most powerful film on the Vietnam war. The part of the movie that was the hardest for me to watch was the village scene. It's one thing if oliver stone exaggerated that part, however, things like that really happened in Vietnam. I really liked the characters in the film. They all had different aspects of life and war, some good some bad.If you know anyone who fought in Vietnam, see this movie. This is a wonderful and powerful film. A true masterpiece. Quite possibly, Oliver Stone's best film.",Null,1,2,19 November 2011
