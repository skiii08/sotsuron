Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The pinnacle of filmmaking. Lucas is a genius.
","I was lucky enough to come up with press passes to a sneak preview of this movie.  As the theatre went dark, I felt my heart racing. The movie I had waited years for was only seconds away.  The audience was hushed as the familiar 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' flashed on the screen. Then came the prologue as John Williams' theme boomed in dolby digital. Tears rushed to my eyes as I realized just how much 'Star Wars ' really means to me.  My breath grew short as the movie began. The visual effects were totally stunning.  As the plot went into full swing, I was totally absorbed by the intricate story line and lifelike characters.  In most cases the acting was superb, especially that of Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, and Jake Lloyd.  When it was all over, I felt I couldn't wait until the 19th when I could see this masterpiece again.  The writing was great, hats off to George Lucas.  If there was one downside to this movie, it was the way Lucas tried to get laughs through cheap humor, but this flaw was not enough to diminish the greatness of the movie at all.  I recommend 'The Phantom Menace' to anyone. May the Force Be With You All. Drew",10,0,2,16 May 1999
