Marie Antoinette," I got to tour France
","with out traveling. Should win awards for costumes. Why on earth dd they ruin the movie with all that music? There was not enough acting, did Sophia think Kristin could not handle more words. Maybe, Sophia must have been lazy this time at giving lines. I wish I could get a refund,on the movie. I could have waited for it to be on television, I was very disappointed. The scenes were great, the costumes were great.I felt like I was watching people dressing up and having a party. I could got a bunch of people together a did a role play party on my own. I and the others that came with me, kept watching waiting for it to pick up. Then the end came, surprisingly there was no end. Marie had 4 children, went to prison... Got her head decapitated. I think someone out there could have done this movie better!!! Come on Sophia you wasted money, not giving this piece of life biography more. My advice wait and save a dime see it on Television.",3,2,4,8 February 2007
