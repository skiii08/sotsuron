The Incredible Hulk," Hulk. S M A S H!
","This movie is outright amazing, I loved it.<ul><li>The movie starts with the credits, no time is wasted at all. It definitely captured the 'incredible' in the Hulk. Character development was top-notch and I felt like I was running around with Edward Norton trying to help him out as he ventured on to and fought for his freedom.</li></ul><ul><li>The CGI... it was at times like real life and at times it gave me chilling memories of the first Hulk, nonetheless it prevails and delivers quite breathtaking action.</li></ul><ul><li>I love this new 'intermixing' of characters that marvel does its quite fun and enjoyable to guess who and why will show up next.</li></ul>The Marvel universe has still lots to give us and I can not wait!",9,3,8,13 June 2008
War of the Worlds," The movie was great , loved it .
","I just saw it...just amazing . The theater was almost as big as an IMAX, I sat on the 3 row.I had to move my eyes and such , the experience was more than great, it was unbelievable.I felt like I was in the movie. Spielberg pulled this off, really well. The only thing that I didn't like was the ending but its OK, because as a whole movie it was almost flawless. It is not a dumb action, it is not a dumb drama, its a great movie. And if you want to see it I suggest you go see it in theaters . I don't get all these people bashing this movie, its freaking great. They should get out of they're basements. Again , nothing short of amazing experience. The CGI was almost as real, the effects were astounding, and the characters played they're role so so good. I loved it. 9/10",10,2,13,29 June 2005
300," Epic has a new name.
","I just came back from the theater and I'm going back at 8:00. This is the most brutally, stunningly beautiful movie to hit theaters in a very very long time, if ever when you consider how it was made. It is pure madness, I could never believe that a movie was going to match my thoughts of 'amazing' so closely. It exceeded my wildest expectations,and I was very hyped up about this too. The whole movie has a vibe and a style that is unmatched. You cant compare it to anything, and even though historically inaccurate it is loosely based on a true story which makes it many times better. The fighting scenes were a spectacle to watch.",10,8,16,11 March 2007
