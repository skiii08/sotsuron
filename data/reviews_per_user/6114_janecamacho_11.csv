Howl's Moving Castle," Beauty and the beast
","I saw this movie once more, an for its benefit I must say that it grows on me every time I see it! For a brief summary of the plot, Howl is a young yet powerful wizard who is very sought after by girls infatuated with him and by the King that wants to recruit his services to the ensuing war. Sophie, a young girl working at a hat store, is cursed by a witch that turns her in to an old woman. As she wonders out of town she ends up working as a cleaning lady in the moving castle where Howl roams about in the countryside, escaping the frantic of civilization. There she meets a fire demon that recognizes her spell and tells her of a mysterious spell that links him with Howl. Howl's moving castle is a touching love story and fantasy fable all rolled in to one. Of course, Myiazaki's trademarks (and Ghibli's production values) are very much present here. The painted landscapes are just breathtaking, among Myiazaki's best drawings. In deed the fictitious country where the movie takes place, that could very well by from turn of the century Europe, has much of nature depicted through these landscapes as of civilization and technology starting to boom from its cradle. Here magic and wizards are a part of society and the front line on the upcoming war with the neighboring country. War, civilization opposed to nature, the difficulties of growing up, all of these are usual themes in much of Myiazaki's work and are here presented in a way reminiscent of some of Disney's nineties classics. Another interesting fact, also common to many of the director's movies, is that some key elements from the story are suggested radder than explicitly presented, allowing you to sink in with every new viewing and reevaluating it's relevance in the Japonese master's work. A truly wonderful experience, that only a handful of directors know how to do. Despite it's inevitable similarities and comparisons with other Myiazaki movies (which tend to arouse criticism), Howl's moving castle is, first a foremost, a beautiful love story!",8,0,2,9 July 2010
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A ride on the roller coaster
","Raiders of the lost ark (1981) is a certified roller coaster of entertainment! If you start watching it you will not be able to get your eyes of the screen or keep in your seat. Even the current generation, used to cgi effects won't be deterred from the old time effects present in the movie (matté shots, physical stunts, etc...). I mean, for some reason Lucas and Spielberg decided to maintain the same style of filmmaking in the latest installment of the Indiana Jones franchise, despite the time gap elapsed since Raiders (27 years) and the technology developed since.This is an adventure-fantasy movie, period. No greater aspirations or elevating themes suggested. We have a hero, Professor Henry Jones Junior (AKA the gung ho archaeologist Indiana Jones), who is running against the stereotypical bad guys to get a land mark archaeological gem, the lost ark of the covenant, overcoming all the traps they lay for him, fighting of every scrimmage possible-and imaginable:- there's a fight in a moving airplane, a pursuit in the streets of Cairo, an escape from a large moving boulder, etc . In this Indiana Jones movie, the first installment in the series, the bad guy is a suave french archaeologist, aided by a group of nazi soldiers and gestapo officers (yes, the movie is set in a pre- second world war scenario), who always out wit Indy, but never seem to get rid of him!George Lucas has long stated that Indiana Jones is an homage to the old republic serial adventures. Well I haven't seen any of them (they never ran in my country, Portugal), but every one of the Indy movies seem like a very large and entertaining episode that when it's over leaves in me an overwhelming hunger for the next movie, so I supposed that was the general idea perceived by Lucas.The next thing is to try and explain to you why am I reviewing on this particular Indy movie. Because it's the best in the series? No, at least not for me. That accolade falls to the third movie, 'Indiana Jones and the last crusade'. Never the less, after seeing it recently I felt I was looking at a rough diamond. Not quite polished and there for not yet presented in all its magnificence, but awakening the nostalgic feelings in you, because you know your in for a fast and bumpy ride, keeping your blood running. Your in for the various lushing sets; the many adventures to come; the different exotic places around the world, everything well scored by John Williams (he actually has a different tune for each character and situation, a device that he followed through the entire series)!And in the end who (or what) do we have to think to: George Lucas' witty imagination? Harrison Ford's superb rendition of the Humphrey Bogart type of hero? Steven Spielberg's ability to film a fantastic adventure movie_ I've seen the recent Tintin movie he made and trust me, he still knows how to do it!Only one thing plagues my mind: when these guys are gone, who will we turn to for a good adventure movie on the Sunday afternoon?!!!",7,0,0,6 May 2012
Apocalypse Now," A long journey through the gates of hell.
","I saw the redux version of Apocalypse now the day before yesterday and it's stuck in my mind since. I had already seen it, nevertheless the experience of watching it again was (as it always is) very refreshing! It's like admiring a painting by Michelangelo or DaVinci for a second time and being mesmerized by every detail, every color, every line.For a bit of plot summary, the movie follows captain Willard (Sheen) who during the Vietnam war is given the mission of killing a highly decorate Colonel, Kurtz (Brando). Kurtz has retrieved deep within the Cambodjian forest, exercising his command without any restrains and leading a group of native followers who constitute 'his' army. So Willard must pick up his track and get to him by hitchhiking a ride with a patrol boat crew up the river and into the heart of the forest, or more fittingly into the heart of darkness.This movie should not be viewed as a docudrama from the GI's point of view, shedding some light on the horrors of the War in Vietnam, or of war in general. Apocalypse now is more of a soul searching experience within a war background, a war whose worse aspects provide the elements needed to create the canvas in which the story evolves. If I'm allowed to indulge in some free interpretation, the movie is an exercise on the worst side within the human psyche, its darkest side, and the path leading to it, a path that Sheen's character is forced to pursue as he searches for Kurtz. As he begins to understand him he also starts to get closer to that darkness within him. So the whole journey up the river can be understood as an allegory for a journey into the soul, into that dark side where Kurtz supposedly has reached and which is very well suggested in the narrative by his encroaching in the heart of the jungle. As a matter of fact there are enough suggestions and key moments in the movie to support this (possible) interpretation. It's as if John Millius and Francis Ford Coppola tried to adapt Joseph Conrad's book ('The heart of darkness'), as a kind of Dante's Inferno blended in the Vietnam war.But this abstract and stylistic journey isn't brought fourth by merit of the script alone. The visual style, the editing, the score, all contribute to this complex canvas as I called it: Vittorio Storaro's cinematography alternates between a pale daylight and the dark night photography, sprinkled with only a few bright lights giving a sense of otherworldly atmosphere to the whole movie. That along with Carmine Coppola's eerie score ultimately emphasizes Willard's psychedelic journey.I must say that although I haven't seen the original version for over ten years, I think the redux version is better. The biggest throwback in this version might be the French plantation scene in which Coppola indulges in considerations about colonialism and patriotism. And although its subject is not devoid of merit (or mishandled for that matter), the fact is that this scene completely stops the movie just as Willard's journey is near the end. However the scene itself can be appreciated for its worth as it doesn't play down all the other inserts in the movie which add a little more depth in secondary characters (like Willards boat companions) alluding to the fact that they too join Willard in his human hellish descent.It wouldn't be fare to go without mentioning the acting: the trio Sheen, Brando and Duvall stand out! Martin Sheen is very convincing, as a man that doesn't fit in society. A soldier aware of his terrible part in the war and a perfect Dantesque character for the journey ahead; Brando and Duvall impersonate the characters already gone that far 'up the river', which highlights the hypocrisy of the generals who condemn Kurtz yet condone Colonel Kilgore's (Duvall) equally unsound warfare. As for Marlon Brando well, he always distinguished himself portraying characters on the edge of a strait razor, and here he paints yet another wonderful performance in the history of cinema, despite his short screen time.Aside for this a note worth mention: the arduous work by Francis Ford Coppola in making this masterpiece possible is documented in 'the hearts of darkness', a documentary about the already known troubles that plagued the shooting and production of this movie. But that, is for another review I hope my words have been of some help to you!",9,0,1,5 May 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," The human odyssey
","This movie is still a puzzle to me, even more so than the first time I saw it fourteen years ago. Curiously, that very first time I didn't thought much of it. I was hoping for something that could shed some light in to the events described at the opening of its sequel, '2010: year of contact' (of all things!). That really put the hook on me. But then again 2001 is not a movie to provide fast or conventional entertainment, let alone to provide you with answers. If one has to write a review on a movie such as '2001: A space odyssey', the very first problem that comes to the central fore is the fact that there is no conventional plot line for the viewer to follow. The way I see it, this movie is made of an overture, three acts, and a (very) long epilogue. The first act deals with the misshapenings of a group of pre-historic men fighting with a rival gang for possession of a water lake. We then leap to the twenty first century, traveling with scientist Heywood Floyd to the moon where he has to deal with a ground breaking discovery. In the third act, aboard the spaceship Discovery and half way in a mysterious mission to Jupiter, a drama unfolds as the on board supercomputer HAL 9000 appears to malfunction and plunges astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole in a struggle to survive. Along these seemly unrelated acts, the only thing resembling a plot line is the close encounter between the characters of each story and a mysterious object in the form of a black monolith. However, the only time where this plot is actually followed through is in the long epilogue, where Dave Bowman chases several of those enigmatic monoliths in a psychedelic journey through outer space. Never the less the end comes, and we still don't get an answer to the nature of these mysterious objects and their undisclosed relation to mankind. This very unsatisfying finally alludes to the absence of a solid (or conventional) plot line within the whole movie. Of course we could indulge in some free interpretation. Assuming that the whole monolith plot is a red herring, if we search for something to connect the movie together, there are several recurrent motifs, one of which, the evolution of mankind. Some examples of it are pointed out through musical cues: Kubrick's use of 'Thus spoke Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss is presented whenever that recurrent motif comes up. Parallel scenes like the encounter between the ape-men and the monolith which is mimicked by the astronauts on the moon, indicating the possibility of another step in mankind's evolution. Never the less, Stanley Kubrick avoids any explicit conclusion, or opinion that could direct the viewer to what he intends to. Every time evolution is suggested, we are presented with all possible consequences that come from it, good and bad: the most obvious example of this is the dramatic third act and it's memorable character HAL, a symbol of man's achieved perfection, playing God. And yet when the computer malfunctions and the crew has to fight for their survival, Bowman has no doubt but to destroy Man's own creation. Human kind at its best and at its worst. So when the end comes up and the immortal all powerful star child is looking at you, we can't help wonder what will prevail, good or evil. I believe Kubrick's intention was to leave it up to us to make our own minds. Furthermore, this possible story line and its interpretation don't make for the whole film. In fact, there are many aspects of the movie that strike an impact on the viewer just by their visual presentation, along with other artistic choices from Kubrick that don't follow the standard use in film industry. For example, the leap in the story, that ends the 'Dawn of man' act with a transition shot so fluid and perfect that surpasses any significance within the story and could be enjoyed just for its sheer beauty. There is the docking of a spaceship that lasts for 4 minutes without contributing to plot development, but mesmerizes you with its space choreography, aided by the Blue Danube waltz playing in the background. And of course there is HAL, one of the most memorable characters put on screen. He chills you out with its soft voice and glaring red eye (as a friend of mine described it), and draws your empathy when facing his own death, pleading for his life just like a human being: ' please stop, Dave. I'm afraid.' An iconic scene in movie history!All these aspects give a feeling that the director's intention was not only to engage in philosophical introspection about human kind's evolution and destiny, but also to present what could be call an abstract movie, aesthetically provocative, with much attention paid to form, images and sound, as much as content, breaking all ties with conventional film making. These two facts put together capture your imagination and senses as no other film in the mainstream production industry.To sum it up, this movie is a unique visual experience, as much as a mind challenging picture!",10,0,2,13 August 2010
Once Upon a Time in America," Leone's final Jigsaw puzzle
","This is truly a complex film to watch! Leone's final testament to his cinematic artistry and his most beloved project is a movie that draws inevitable comparisons to such films as The godfather and Novecento. There are many elements in common with these pictures: the chronological leaps in the story, the gangster background, a love-hate friendship, all of which are treated in a unique way that distinguishes this movie from his pears and gives it Leone's brand. Robert DeNiro is David 'Noodles' Aronson, a young hoodlum turned gangster that, as we are told in the beginning of the movie, has betrayed his friends and partners and so goes in to hiding. Several years later he returns to track down a mysterious person who found him and somehow knows all about his betrayal all those years ago. This premise stars off a series of flashbacks from Noddles that, piece by piece shed some light in to previous events and scenes from the beginning which to the viewers didn't make much sense.Leone's storytelling is slow. It was in his previous two movies and much more so in Once upon a time in America. That in itself might detach even the more patient viewers. Truly he aimed very high with this picture, and if you take on the suggested comparison I mentioned, you have DeNiro's 'Noodles' a tragic character that ends up losing everything and everyone in the end, much like Michael Corleone in The Godfather, or some of the characters from David Lean's movies for that matter! So, the epic proportions of Once upon a time have a precedent that must have been present in Leone's mind when he conceived it. Even more: Franco Arcalli, co-writer of the movie, was also co-writer, and editor of Novecento, so you can't help wondering how much of the 'two men friendship' motif transpired from that Bertolucci film. But I think the similarities stop there! In Once upon a time in America the love triangle between Noodles, Maxie and Deborah come to the central fore, and the prohibition/gangster plot, despite providing long pauses in the narrative, serve as a stylistic background to the main theme. Leone was a passionate for American History, as his Western movies confirm, so it would be expected that he explored an American period (the prohibition era) with so much elements in common with the violent and mythic Wild West. Furthermore, to add to the complexity of this film he introduced yet again an unexpected turn in the story witch unfolds in the very end, and keep you guessing about what you have just seen. It was so in the end of Once upon a time in the west and in Duck you sucker, and here you get the idea (as suggested by Leone himself) that the whole movie is Noodles opium based dream, and you really never leave the Chinese theater where he is smoking his pipe in self pity for his actions! Complex? Very much. In the end you get the feeling that Leone got through his point rather more effectively in his earlier western Once upon a time in the west. But enough with the critiques! If you can get through the slow pace of the movie, and really sink in the intended suggestions in the narrative the reward will be, as the whole movie in itself, grandiose and epic. After all this is a Sergio Leone film. As a 'master painter of pictures', if you don't quite grasp the meaning of the painting you can still get reward by just admiring the colors. You have the beautifully composed shots of 1930's New York through the cinematography of Tonino Delli Colli (Leone's regular collaborator); the extreme close-ups that depict character emotions like with no other director; Leone's trademark eyes close up which are reduced to a single, beautiful transition shot between the elder and the younger Noodles watching his beloved Deborah; the final showdown, which evolved into a duel of words between the two friends; and last but not the least, Ennio Morricone at the helm of the soundtrack (composed prior to the film) conveying the dream like feel to movie, both idyllic (in Deborah's theme) and cruel (in Dominic's death scene). My advice? Whach it! After all, this was Leone's final masterpiece!",8,3,6,23 January 2010
Chariots of Fire," Feel the olympic spirit...
","I've watched this movie yesterday. It has been a long time since i saw it for the first time, and i must say it made an impression on me like it never did before. 'Chariots of fire' is your usual sports-achievement type movie, with some of the usual clichés. But you have to be able to see the big picture and understand that in the year this movie was made (1981), the genre was not a common place in Hollywood history yet. This picture set the mark for all of those who would come in the later years, and in fact the industry tried very hard to explore it as much as it could. The story is set in the time gap that preceded the 1924 olympic games, and focus on two running athletes from the British team that competed in the games. It is a period movie, with good production and costumes design that really sets you in the first quarter of the last century. The editing and music score by Vangelis (especially) helps in conveying the heroic achievement feel to the movie.Time hasn't wore down this movie!",7,0,0,14 June 2009
Castle in the Sky," Castle in the sky has Miyazaki's signature all over it!
","Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film. After seeing it for the first time I'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint. On the contrary, you get your time's worth, which means (as to what Miyazaki's films are concern), that is nothing less than excellent! Produced early in his cinematic career, Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies, with strong (but young) female characters, forced to grow up due to external circumstances, helped out by very interesting (and some times lovable) supporting characters. And of course, flying machines (lots of it!!). Never the less, Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier, with Nausicãa, which was narratively speaking, a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke, his magnum opus. Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two, with a soft action packed first 30 minutes, resembling his TV series Conan, and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes. In here we are introduced to Sheeta, a girl who literally falls from the sky, only to be found by Pazu, a young boy working in a little countryside mining town. Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa, Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from, whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates. As the movie progresses, the plot gets heavier and much more interesting, revealing Myiazaki at his best. The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away, (or vice versa, as Castle in the sky was produced first), and much like its director, Joe Hisaishi _the composer_ starts with a very light score, that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward! A note to the English dubbing, with a good interpretation from the two lead stars, although Anna Paquin's Sheeta has a very thick accent (which the actress still had at that point in her career), and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska, making up for a delightfully yet devilish villain! Don't miss this one people!",7,1,3,29 July 2009
Ben-Hur," What an epic is all about!
","I've recently searched for a definition of what an epic film is, and found in Wikipedia the following: 'a film that emphasizes human drama on a grand scale' That says it all. In deed a human drama, with a character's achievements and ordeals in the central stage, generally within the context of an historical event for its background to give it the so called epic scope, and dramatized with big production values. That's what an epic film is, and Ben Hur is THE EPIC. So that the reader can understand where 'I'm from', the occasional epic (specially biblical epics like Samson & Delilah, The ten commandments, The robe, etc) where mandatory in Sunday school _when I was a catholic student_ and a delightful treat at home for Easter Sunday. Through them I got to know Victor Mature, Jean Simons, Kirk Douglas  and of course, Charlton Heston! So Ben Hur was an expected addition to the list when I discovered it fifteen years ago, on a Sunday afternoon. I watched it with my grandmother who served me the live 'audio commentary track', through key moments in the picture like if she was watching her favorite novel, astounded on how much was cut in the old days due to Portuguese censorship. Ben Hur owes much to Cecil B. DeMille's productions, being also a forerunner (in a technical sense) for other epics like Spartacus or any of David Lean's stravaganzzas. For a bit of plot summary: - Judah Ben Hur (Heston) is a wealthy man in Roman occupied Judea, just about the time of Jesus Christ's ministry. He reunites with an old boyhood friend, Messala (Stephen Boyd). They try to rekindle the old friendship, but find that they have grown in to absolute opposite young men, one being a passioned Jew patriot, the other a roman soldier with the will to make a career at the expense of the Jew people. Thus the short lived Idyll is broken. Just a few days later Ben Hur and its family are involved in an accident with the new roman governor, and are accused and condemned in moments notice by Messala who wishes to inspire fear by making an example out of Ben Hur. So the old friends became enemies, and Ben Hur's hate and quest for revenge gets started. Lew Wallece's novel (on which the movie is based on) does a pretty good job leaving the ministry and passion of Christ in the background, giving it a strange role of mystical influence over the story unfolding in the central stage, which is Ben Hur's search for revenge and peace of mind. The two stories run parallel to each other in the movie, joining forces in the last act, giving it a very meaningful conclusion and thus shedding some light to the author's chosen subtitled (elapsed form this 1959 remake) A tale of the Christ. A storytelling technique resembling that of D. W. Grifith's movie Intolerence (1916). Another interesting fact concerning the scale of the film is that Heston's character goes through enough events during the story, over a time span big enough to be called an Odyssey (in the Homeric sense ) thus the epic nature prevailing in the story. From the harsh and cruel scenes in the roman galleys and in the catacombs in Jerusalem, to the Shakespearian dialogs between Ben Hur and Messala during the falling out in the beginning of the picture, and right after the race in the circus _ 'There is still enough of man here for you to hate. () The race, it goes on Judah!' _ and of course the classical, and ever since copied chariot race show down in the circus. Well, there are enough moments for you to cherish and too many for me to name. And without neglecting the technical aspects, like the huge (unrealistic) sets, many of them built on location, giving a sense of grandeur; Miklos Rosza's score, adding to the epic feel of the movie (tunes like the rowing in the galley scenes, the roman parades, or the final Hallelluya get stuck with you for a long time); Heston's (well deserved) academy award wining performance; Boyd's unforgivably unrewarded rendition of the tribune Messala If Wylliam Wyller wanted to tackle with a Cecil B DeMille special, I would say mission accomplished!Drawbacks in the picture? Perhaps the religious motif in the story might not sink in with every one, and the viewer that's not sensible to it could feel somewhat detached. Being a catholic myself I must say that watching this movie always rekindles my faith, remembering some of the things that I cherish from the New Testament, like the role of forgiveness in our hearts, and that hate, while a convenient fuel, is a poor substitute for love. So if my words have tantalized you, my advice is watch it! Take a Sunday afternoon off (preferably Easter Sunday) and watch it!",10,0,3,23 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Half way the story: pros & cons.
","What a difficult task, reviewing an isolated chapter of a much larger franchise such as the Star Wars saga! One might draw parallels with other epic undertakes as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, for example. Is it fair to review a single movie as an independent story, when actually much of what transpires from it (or to it) is directly linked to crucial motifs in a story that spans for six movies? Not only that but in the particular case of this movie (episode), we have reached half way in the story, with the first act of the saga completed in the earlier episode (Revenge of the Sith), giving this movie the job of linking the two trilogies together. So as one might expect we get back in first gear again, with the story unfolding very slowly again.Some twenty (more or less) years later after the events that toke place in 'Revenge of the Sith', the empire is already established, the senate hanging on a thread, and with the Jedi almost extinct nothing is between the emperor and his grip on the universe, except for a few rebels. The movie opens with a ship carrying princess Leya, a rebel ambassador, fleeing from an imperial cruiser.Lucas has told many times that he chose to tell this movie and its story from the point of view of the two bickering droids, R2D2 and C-3PO. For as amusing as it is (they really stand out as a kind of odd couple), this really makes the first half of the movie very slow. Inspired from Kurosawa's 'Hidden Fortress', these slow beginnings where seldom in the Japanese director's movies, but then again you got rewarded in the end, as Kurosawa made self contained movies and no sequels, hence the drawback in Lucas choice. Before George Lucas directed the later trilogy it was understandable, as there was the need for introducing characters. Not anymore! For some interesting exceptions (the delightfully Han Solo) we already know from the prequels who the droids are, who Obi-Wan is, who Darth Vader is, etcetera, etcetera. Perhaps one of the few unexpected consequences of the recently produced trilogy and prequels.However, once we get to the second half of this episode things start to get moving! The escape from the Death Star helps you to sink in with the real nature of Episode IV, an adventure movie more than anything else, not really worried with developing the true motif and backbone of this saga which revolves around the Skywalker family. From there on, including that final assault on the Death star (very nicely done by the way!!), going through it all with the land mark score by John Williams (which is indefinitely part of the story's identity), we are definitely in gear: accepting the new characters and their roles in the saga, as well as going back to our empathy for the old ones (Obi Wan and such). And of course, by this time the prequels have helped to emphasize our wish to see the Skywalker novella unfold. So when the credits come on the screen you are already reaching for the 'Empire strikes back' DVD.To conclude my review, if you want to see a self contained movie, you are in for a fair adventure movie, but the real prize will get past you if you haven't seen the prequels or don't intent to see the sequels. So don't waste time. By the whole lot and see the full six episodes! It's a unique cinematic experience.",6,0,3,8 August 2010
Princess Mononoke," An epic tale to remember...
","Mononoke Hime (or Princess Mononoke) is one of those movies for which words are not enough, because its simply too beautiful to describe! As I'm writing this comment, I'm reminiscing on how I came to read of it for the first time, through a small review in a known movie magazine, where its critic wrote how the first ten minutes of Princess Mononoke were just breathtaking. That review stuck with me for some time, and was revived two years later as I went to the video store looking for something for my young brother (aged 11 at the time) to see in the weekend. To make a long story short: I was the one that end up watching it, at 2:00 o'clock on a Sunday morning. And what a surprise! I didn't knew who Hayao Miyazaki was, but I certainly got to Know him from that point on! The story is set in a fantasy like Japan, where the groundbreaking molding of iron was disputed by several feudal lords (and the emperor itself), and the forests were ruled by spirits and gods in the form of giant animal-beasts! In deed the first ten minutes of the movie are presented to us in over drive, as a former god turned demon rages in to the peaceful village of the Emishi tribe, leaving it to its prince, Ashitaka, to defend it . And so the movie gets started!In all of his previous movies Miyazaki had already presented us with the classical duel of Human versus Nature which is in the center stage here. The whole movie can be seen as a huge metaphor, exploring that very same theme, with characters depicting each side of the conflict_ Lady Eboshi and San _ that are everything but one dimensional characters, and can't be labeled as good or bad, as if Miyazaki is inviting us to make our own judgment about them; and of course there is Ashitaka, a fated prince that in his own search for peace of mind ends up being the leverage that tries to bring each side to a peaceful existence. In the end you are left in absolute awe, and questioning yourself how could such a masterpiece ever got to the finish line in one piece! Could it be the story and script on which Miyazaki labored for so long (story has it that he started developing the characters as far as thirteen years prior to the movie)? Is it the top notch cell animation technique, or the beautiful color with which the sceneries are depicted? Or is it the engaging musical score by Joe Hisaishi, that gives an epic feel to the movie as well as enhancing the more intimate side of it (I saw it yesterday and I'm still humming to every single tune there is in the movie)? Perhaps it's the sum of all in the end that make up for its magnificence and beauty. So if you are skeptical about such seriousness being presented in a fantasy-like animated movie don't be. Trust me! Just risk seeing the first minutes of the movie and you'll get hooked, for sure!",10,0,1,31 July 2009
Evil Dead II," A trip into a world of horror and comedy!
","The Evil Dead trilogy still comes through as top notch, low budget, scary movies in the style of such titles as Nightmare on Elm street. This particular chapter of the trilogy _ Evil Dead II _ gives us as much as you can expect from a sequel, and more. That is to say, you must expect more ghoulish demoniacal possessions; more hand-held camera movements; and more, much more BLOOD! However, Evil Dead II starts to separate it self from other movies in this genre (and its prequel for that matter), particularly in a growing non-sense comedy style witch very smoothly sets in. Although one might think that horror and comedy don't mix, Sam Raimi really pulled it off. For that purpose its clear that Bruce Campbell gets 'carte blanch' with his character Ash. You can't help to laugh in some of the scenes inside the lodge with his over the top performance. But don't worry, because the horror and gore side of the movie is still there, all the way to the end. So, if you were a big fan of the first movie, and are not in the mood of something a bit different, don't watch this. On the other hand, if you can keep an open mind about it, then you'll get a great trip for sure. Enough said! I don't want to spoil it for you!",10,5,5,3 July 2009
