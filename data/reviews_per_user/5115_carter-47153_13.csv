Iron Man 3," The Identity of Iron Man
","Tony Stark is a character that was created to court controversy. Comic creator Stan Lee has admittedly stated that in creating Tony Stark his goal was to create an arms dealer during the Vietnam era who becomes a hero. The challenging element to this creative decision was in making him likable to a generation of youths who were against the Vietnam War. By injuring him mortally through a heart wound and making him vulnerable and then leading him to essentially don a suit of armor like a chivilaristic knight, Stan Lee was able to create a sympathetic character out of an unsympathetic situation. Throughout Mr. Stark's storied history, comic creators have added further moral conflict into his character. These additional conflicts have included alcoholism and absolute black & white decisions.The question posed by this unique character is what is it that makes up the worth of an individual; is it the contributions made toward the community or is it something more innate? In the film Iron Man 3, Mr. Stark struggles with the idea of is his value as Iron Man or as a person able to contribute to society with his own natural talents. This is a question that he is only able to answer when his quality of life, his technology, friends and family are taken away from him.This is a dilemma that many people have to face at some point in their lifetime. Generally when someone introduces themselves to a new acquaintance they state their name and their occupation. By doing this a person is prioritizing their occupation over other areas in their life. This displays a sense of identity within how a person contributes to their community whether it be local or regionally.This is a concept that is reinforced through our upbringing and family life. The message that some receive is that there is value not only in your occupation but that there are occupations that are better than others. This leads to behaviors geared to attain the best occupation possible to display yourself. Some of these behaviors include gearing our life to be more available for work such as where we live, what we do in our leisure time and other personal decisions.While there are other areas of life that suffer in importance in opposition to a person's occupation such as volunteer time, personal relationships, personal development and so on. While the potential of community impact and personal value is just as great for the other areas of life; they are put on the back burner for the professional life. This causes some individuals to become numb to a complete life and to minimize the importance of such a life. It is only when we lose what we consider to be our life that we are able to find value in the rest of our life. It is regrettable that this tends to only happen when we are forced to in order to find happiness within our lives.",8,1,4,24 August 2015
John Wick," Keanu's Comeback
","Keanu Reeves. It is a name closely associated with career defining roles and missed opportunities. He has had some of the top fan favorite roles and cultural icons over the last twenty five years. From Neo (The Matrix Trilogy), to Ted (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure), John Constantine (Constantine) to Jack Traven (Speed). He has been a part of science fiction remakes (The Day the Earth Stood Still), Expiramental Animation (A Scanner Darkly) and Horror (Bram Stoker's Dracula).Mr. Reeves has shown an acting range from the dramatic, comedy and physical action. Though he has had a tremendous career his characters have tended to flat and a little unbelievable.Sure he proved in Speed that he could be an 'action star', in The Watcher that he could be creepy and could handle lead acting duties in a franchise with The Matrices though his roles had become diminished over the last five years. Though his performances have never been bad, the expectations that surround him have always been out of reach. Then came John Wick.As of late, Mr. Reeves has begun a comeback of sorts. The phrase 'of sorts' is used as his comeback is not finished yet. It started with Man of Tai Chi and 47 Ronin and has continued into John Wick. It has the feel of a role that is perfect for Mr. Reeves' acting abilities. John Wick is a character who is dark and brooding. The character is not put into a position where he would express happiness. He is angry, sad, and on the verge of grief throughout the film. Mr. Reeves' ability to perform choreographed action scenes is put on display here. These range from intense fighting scenes to wonderfully choreographed shootouts to elaborate set pieces that border extravagant but don't cross the line.Several times throughout the film the fight scenes are set up in a manner that allow Mr. Reeves to perform in a flawless manner. This is done by letting the camera roll. As opposed to the standard practice constant cuts during filming and letting the editors piece together a fight scene, the director of John Wick keeps the camera rolling and allows the audience to experience John Wick's physical struggle and exhaustion. These are not simple fight scenes either. In a couple of instances the actors are having to perform dozens of physical moves while the camera demands perfection. Mr. Reeves not only succeeds at this but also helps to show the believability that he is capable of in the right circumstances.One can only hope that this movie will continue to place Mr. Reeves in strong roles that he is more than capable of continuing to play. It is a definite treat to see Mr. Reeves at his best again.",8,2,6,24 August 2015
Interstellar," The Reconciliation of Humanity With Technology
","Throughout the history of produced fiction a common theme is the conflict between humanity and technology. This conflict arises from the idea that humanity is a pure concept capable of achieving anything while technology is limited by the design intended by it's creator. The normal conclusion drawn from this is that anything produced from technology cannot be greater than humanity as humanity is not a quantifiable element that can be reproduced.In the film Interstellar, a story is told in which a group of explorers go to another galaxy via a wormhole to try to find a new planet to live on as the Earth is dying. The film explores concepts such as how Relativity actually works, Love as a measurable physical thing and humanity within machines. While the film deals with many more issues (many existing within the realm of the philosophical), these mentioned ideas are prevalent throughout the whole film.The protagonists of the film leave Earth in a noble effort to try to save all of humanity from an ecological disaster. The motivations of these characters are unselfish and prosocial at it's most basic element. As the story progresses the audience learns that one character, Dr. Brand has personal reasons for going on the expedition, that an antagonist character Dr. Mann (ironically named) has a absolute sole motivation of achieving the mission only for the sake of it. This includes minimizing the importance of the existence of other people around him.We are also introduced to a couple of artificial characters. Despite these characters being created by members of humanity they display an authentic range of emotions. These emotions include humor, sarcasm, a preference for caution and trust. While the humans can set the level of each of these emotions, the artificial beings display authentic and healthy responses. They assist the goals of the protagonists and help keep them on course with the larger noble goals.Interstellar presents several positive themes and one of many that it got right is that a person can be better than it's parent. It reinforces themes that a person is in charge of their life and how they are in control of their own life rather than just a product of their parents.",10,0,3,24 August 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The Individualism of The Rogie Nation
","Governments. We are dependent on them to point us in the best general direction. We rely on them to help us take care of ourselves and the people in our lives. Whether the government of discussion is democratic, monarchy based or totalitarian based, the governments tend to offer social programs for it's citizens if for nothing else to pacify the population and ensure their sovereignty. So it is with this basic concept that we are given hope that we are cared for and have a place within our community on a local, regional and national level.Within Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, the main protagonist Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) finds himself 'left out in the cold' and isolated from his government and his friends (community). Mr. Hunt contrasts well with Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) who has allowed himself to be hurt by his government's actions and has accepted a life of isolation. As the story progresses we learn that the 'Rogue Nation' does not refer to the antagonist, 'Mr. Lane's' rival group 'The Syndicate. Rather it refers to the actions committed by our characters' governments.In this film the governments in question are the British and the United States governments. They operate within secrets and despite policies of transparency display non-accountability behaviors. These governments create their own enemies through their policies and operate without thinking of the individual. While they operate through their agencies as if they were an island upon themselves, Mr. Hunt and the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) operate as a group. They care about each other, help each other out and understand the value of each person. It is because of this relationship difference that these governments are the Rogue Nation.The film illustrates the point that people are able to surmount any obstacle and work through any problem with a little help from the community and specifically their friends. The film expresses this message very well and even goes as far as to show that there are limitations as to what an individual can do. That an individual can ask for help and that her community will be there to help you when you are at your lowest low. That the lack of faith in one's government is a two way street. If one shows some faith the outlook of institutions around us has the potential to change and work for us.",9,0,3,19 August 2015
Independence Day," Still Holds Up Well
","Roland Emmerich. The name is synonymous with epic-level disaster movies. From Godzilla 2000 to 2012, Mr Emmerich has made the majority of a career of making movies on the edge of largest as possible. He has created a model that has allowed the return of disaster movies and it started with Independence Day.The movie depicts a struggle between humanity-reeling from devastating attacks and highly advanced alien invaders. The story follows a select group of these survivors enduring attacks on a genocide scale. Mr. Emmerich was able to put together an all star cast to complement the Oscar-winning visual effects.Bill Pullman leads the cast as the President of the United States, a steady youthful figure who falls into the standard profile of a cinematic President. Jeff Goldblum continued his trend of playing the scientist figure who suffers in life due to his lack of emotional expression. Will Smith in a role that cemented his meteoric rise to acting stardom plays an air force pilot. Costars include Robert Loggia, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and musician, Harry Connick Jr.While the movie's theme coincides with it's release weekend, July 3rd; the movie itself tends to pay homage to films such as Star Wars, The Day the Earth Stood Still and other classic science fiction movies. This is done primarily through familiar camera angles and setups that were pioneered during the classic era.While Mr. Emmerich's cast does a good job of moving the plot forward and showing appropriate emotion as needed; Independence Day shows it's weaknesses during predictable plot twists and the lack of a singular identifiable antagonist. The movie now nineteen years old has stood the test of time and compared with today's blockbusters still is able to show it's quality.",8,0,0,24 August 2015
8 Mile," The Key to Success
","In 8 Mile, we are introduced to a youth who believes that his ticket to success in life is through a rap career. He plans to achieve this by participating in battle raps. He has setbacks that involve his own securities and dealing with racial expectations. Throughout the film he begins to see that the better path in life would be to set more realistic goals in order to be successful.The message of the film is two fold. While an individual can succeed by setting those goals and compromising on their dreams from childhood; a community can also prosper when it's citizens pull together and focus on what needs to be done. This message is not lost on the director of this film. The setting of this film is in the city of Detroit. A city that has fallen on hard times with the how the economy has come out over the last decade. Several times throughout the film there are instances that show the apathy and regression of the city of Detroit while the characters stagnate.It is only by experiencing where his life is heading and what decisions have the most value can our main character able to move past his stagnation and begin to grow. This tends to be true in reality as it is easy to have a perfect idea of what someone wants their life to turn out as but it is harder to accept that that always can't be the case. Sometimes a person has to find their niche in order to find some success in life. This doesn't always bring about instant happiness but the acceptance of this fact always the growth to happen to earn your own happiness.",9,1,2,24 August 2015
Clash of the Titans," The Pride of Man
","As a whole people have a difficult time accepting help whether it be from friend or foe. Generally speaking, a person carries emotional baggage with them that affects their decisions for good and for bad. A large part of this baggage is passed down to us by our parents and those who influenced our lives early on. Sometimes this results in the acceptance of help and other times it compels us to refuse help out of pride, shame or any number of secondary emotions.These thoughts coalesced during a secondary viewing of remake of the film, 'Clash of the Titans'. While the movie did fail on many levels, what it did get right was the above message. Perseus throughout the entire story, refused his father, Zeus' assistance. In his mind he needed to prove and to know and that he wasn't like the other gods and that a human could accomplish great deeds. Only once, he was able to cut off Medusa's head without godly assistance was he able to accept that he could allow Zeus' offerings; a Pegasus and a sword.This is not something that is exclusive to a narrative. Everyday we make decisions that have the potential to be based on qualities passed onto us that he feel shame or pride in. Often, these decisions limit our potential and what we are able to accomplish in our lifetime. On the extreme end of that, those who cannot cope with their baggage may even descend into a lesser life lived. There is no one path for a person to take in order to work through this baggage and achieve happiness. It is accomplished through trial and error. One person may have to reconcile their feeling about a perceived inadequate parent while another person has to cut a monster's head off. It's all a matter of interpretation.",6,0,0,24 August 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," It Is The Age of Ultron
","As Avengers: Age of Ultron has just crossed the billion dollar mark in worldwide box office, I thought that it would be appropriate for me to finally put a few thoughts into the value of this movie. I have viewed the movie twice and have read numerous reviews and visited comment boards trying to get a rounded perspective before I began this review.For me, reviewing a movie that is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a challenging task. Professional reviewers tend to look at movies as singular pieces of work and seem to be stymied by the concept of an organic storytelling method. This film has seen negative reviews as it spends a portion of itself moving pieces and characters to a 'place' where the next film will pick up. As such, the film includes a small number of scenes that have little to do with the characters' journey and struggle against the antagonist which is present in traditional storytelling.Kevin Feige from Marvel Studios has discussed how the villain Ultron is relevant to our society currently. That we rely on technology as much as we do is a common theme in current fears and how much of our humanity is lost through our everyday practices. The idea behind concepts like Ultron is that through our actions with little regard for consequences we may bring about technology that will affect our lives so dramatically that there is no going back.Age of Ultron is the culmination and crescendo of the second phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far as Ant-Man will not be released until July. Most of the events of Iron Man 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World and Guardians of the Galaxy have led to this film. As such while Age of Ultron may not be able to exist without these films; what is coming after this film will rely on Age of Ultron for it's exposition. While this is a storytelling method that is revolutionized by Marvel Studios it is not without it's pitfalls. There are moments where the pace of the story is slowed down in order to accommodate this 'always looking ahead' philosophy.There are a lot of moving parts to Age of Ultron. Four main characters are introduced: Ultron, Wanda Maximoff, Pietro Maximoff and The Vision. In addition to having nine other major characters their screen time isn't as much as it could be though for their roles it is appropriate. In fact the film does a better than average job at balancing all of the characters and keeping the pace up and exciting. While in the first Avengers film, Robert Downey Jr had most of the attention on him; in this film while he is present through the film it is Chris Evans' Captain America who begins the movie with a moral dilemma and is the character who changes the most on his journey through story.When Director Joss Whedon began his tour of duty on The Avengers he wanted a story to where just because someone is a hero it doesn't mean that they get a free pass. This is very prominent in Age of Ultron. Due to the events of Avengers and Iron Man 3, Tony Stark reacts by creating a source of technology that brings even greater destruction to his world. It is because of this kind of reaction that The Avengers must fight their own fears made real and their own dark sides. The world in which they inhabit is not one of good versus evil. It is one steeped in realism in which 'one creates that which they fear the most'. The protagonists have to struggle against a threat brought upon simply by their own presence.The film is just as beautiful as the first one. Circular camera movement features heavily into the expanded action scenes. It is used to great effect to enhance the team atmosphere. We are also exposed to long takes that show all The Avengers in action at the same time. These are methods that we have seen before but Mr. Whedon expands upon them to use them to better effect.The actors who are reprising their roles are spot on as has been the case throughout the Marvel movies. In fact as time goes on some of these characters keep getting better and better. The new actors were expertly picked as well. Aaron Taylor Johnson displays Pietro's arrogance perfectly as well as concern for his sister, Elizabeth Olsen brings the insecurity of Wanda, James Spader brings an eloquence and through voice work a sense of menace to Ultron and Paul Bettany who had previously voiced Tony Stark's A.I. Jarvis debuts as The Vision. Through Mr. Bettany's career he has played roles which have required a logical viewpoint mixed with genuine compassion. The Vision is portrayed expertly through this viewpoint.In the end this film is about family. Not family in the traditional sense but the kind of a world we create and how we expect the next generation to cope with it. This is seen primarily through Ultron, The Vision, Wanda and Pietro. It is also about finding our place in the world that we inherit and help to create organically.",9,1,6,24 August 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Next Step in Filmmaking
","Is aggression a prerequisite for the progression of human development? This is one of many questions posed by director Stanley Kubrik in this groundbreaking film. The film is divided into three segments and this question is posed within the first twenty minutes as a group of prehumans come into contact with an alien obelisk. This obelisk starts to move the story forward and effects subtle changes within the prehumans including an intelligence that allows them to use weapons. The story then jumps into the future where humanity has discovered an object on the moon. As the object is approached which appears to be similar as the alien obelisk seen earlier in the film, it gives off a signal of some sort. The story then jumps into a further future where a spacecraft has been sent to the destination point of the alien signal. This causes a series of events that brings about the next evolution of humanity into a 'starchild'.While the issue surrounding aggression and the progression of humanity is addressed early on, it is questions regarding artificial intelligence that creates the conflict within the story. Concerns surrounding how far an A.I. should be made aware and if an A.I. has the right to ensure it's own survival are addressed.Mr. Kubrick pioneered several techniques for this film which included practical ways to make an environment appear weightless. This included showing characters walk on ceilings and also seeing objects float through the air. He was also able to use inventive camera techniques such as using still photographs for wide shots as opposed to taking a film crew with him to film on location.This film is a solid production. Through Mr. Kubrik's camera techniques and the body language of the actors it made to be very believable that the characters are in space. It is definitely a technical achievement especially when these visuals are paired with music that Mr. Kubrick picked personally for the movie. The film does lack in that their is no clear protagonist or antagonist. There is no character development for any character as no character is around long enough. It is almost as if the characters are there just to facilitate the progression of the story.This film was finished almost a decade before Star Wars and helped to define the genre for it's time. It has remained a classic and has impacted it's genre and cinema in general.",10,2,4,24 August 2015
Mission: Impossible," A Changing World
","Is there a place for time proved methods and principles in today's society? This is a message that is part of the subtext of Mission: Impossible. The film deals with a changing world and how people cannot always change with the world around them. Sometimes the decisions that have to be made lead people to new careers while some people are able to adapt to the changing world within their lives.Over time Mission: Impossible has held up to be a successful example of a film adaption of a television series. Though the production of this film was troubled in finding it's direction and focus. Once Brian De Palma was brought on as director, he was able to alleviate these issues. The production team was able to take a concept and vague character profiles from the television series from the 1960s and translate into an engaging espionage thriller.The story follows an American espionage agent (Tom Cruise) who is framed after his team is killed during a mission. He has to unravel the plot against him and prove his innocence without the support of his government. The film also features Jon Voight, Vanessa Redgrave, Ving Rhames, Jean Reno, Kirsten Scott Thomas and Emilio Estevez. The film's plot is in constant motion. It does not stagnate for long and the film does not stop telling the story to hold the viewer's hand to keep up with the plot twists.This film was the first time that Tom Cruise displayed his action star potential. It not only solidified him as an A-list actor but also someone who could be the forerunner for a franchise. He had to display a different range of acting, as at the time a movie such as this was unexplored territory for him; as well as learn to develop physical abilities for his roles which has continued to the present day.. While the direction of the franchise has been doubted throughout it's course this installment set it on it's path.",8,1,1,24 August 2015
Rocky," The Confidence To Live
","Adolescense. This is a potentially magical time in someone's life. A youth is taught that adulthood will be a time in which all your hard work will pay off. That a successful life is one in which you marry, start a family, find a steady productive job and in doing all of these things a person will find happiness. Many people go down this road with optimism and enthusiasm. At the onset of this journey some elements go well and then reality hits and it hits hard. It becomes more difficult to relate to people around you, professional life is discovered to be a frustrating process and life in general hands a person setback after setback.It is easy to allow the people around us to affect us on such an intimate emotional level that it is possible to never recover from it. A person may have a strong support group early on though at some point, things in life get taken away and at some point a person may realize that life is not what they thought it would be. It can be very difficult for a person to find the courage to continue on their chosen path.These messages are the heart, body and soul of the film Rocky. Not only does the titular character have to reach deep inside himself in order to pull himself out of the life of shame and minimization in order to face life's challenges but he also find his own self worth and confidence in order to set his life back on track. In fact all the supporting characters have experienced disappointment or emotional damages in their life that has led them to having a lesser quality of life.Rocky's girlfriend had been dominated by her older brother all of her life and was just naturally shy. She avoids contact with everybody around her and lives a very isolated life until her brother Paulie forces her to go on a date with Rocky. They find that they are kindred spirits and are then inseparable. She begins to change emotionally when she begins to realize that she can be loved and be loved by someone who will not mistreat her in any way. Her brother Paulie, who spends most of his time between fits of anger or drunken has allowed his life to become absolutely stagnant by settling into a dead end job and forgetting how to take care of himself without Adrian's help and in the end Rocky's.Finally, Rocky's trainer Mick who has already lived through the prime of his life is aware of his mortality and wants to know that he is still useful.It is only when a person is stretched to their limit that they have to look within their self and rediscover their self worth. It is the power of self worth and confidence that allows anybody to accomplish anything that brings about positive change. It is positive change that can bring about happiness as a direction in life brings meaning and importance.",10,2,2,24 August 2015
Die Hard," A Genre Defining Film
","In the 1980s, a unique trend developed in American Cinema. It became popular for one man to go against a larger superior force and emerge triumphant. Die Hard if not the progenitor of this genre, it most certainly stands as the prototype. It helped to establish what is possible for the emerging action genre when done right.This film also established the career of Bruce Willis. At the time, he was considered a major risk. He had not had any significant 'breaks' into film and had an average television career. Through his performance he became a household name and would be propelled into stardom. Mr. Willis was able to capture the 'everyman' struggling through his life and never giving up.Die Hard also introduced to the world the character actor, Alan Rickman. An actor whose speaking voice comes across solemn and droll. His voice was perfect for conveying the arrogance of Hans Gruber, the film's antagonist. He also has a chance to put his voice talents to use as he is required to use two different accents for the role.The film follows a New York policeman, John McClain (Bruce Willis) who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take control of a skyscraper. The film does a good job of balancing action with McClain's physical and emotional suffering. Over time it has held up as an iconic film of the decade as well as within it's own genre.",9,3,3,24 August 2015
12 Years a Slave," The Legacy of America
","Slavery. This distinctly human invention has built empires, maintained economies and has allowed the destruction of empires and society. Slavery has made it's appearance in every corner of the Earth in one form or another. For some it has been brief while others it has lasted longer and some have changed a society; even affecting social and economic growth. Throughout history, slavery has occurred in order to expand territories and governments, harvest natural resources and provide soldiers. In some cases, slavery was so prevalent that there were more slaves than citizens referred to as masters. This was the case with Ancient Rome and eventually led to their downfall.The North American continent was founded as a means to find freedom from persecution, religion and other parts of life that were not being fulfilled within an already established government. Once a foothold was established in the beginning colonies it become apparent that in order to tame the land, provide a boost to the fledgling economy and defend themselves from the new dangers that the continent held; the 'Americans' would need to establish a slave trade in the New World.This decision had the expected impact as there was an entire continent of available slaves that could be sent to America as part of an economic trade. This would eventually make an entire half of a new nation completely dependent upon a property-based labor system.It is during this time period that the film, 12 Years a Slave takes place. The events follow a free African American man who is abducted and sold into slavery and must find a way to persevere until his freedom is regained. The American film industry has a history of producing movies that focus on the American Civil War, and other films that investigate the themes that are created in a situation such as the one described above. The previously produced themes have focused on freed African Americans serving in the army without recognition, or brother fighting brother in the war and the brutality of the life of a slave. Never has a film captured the raw cruelty, barbarism and natural crimes that had taken place during this period.In this film, there is no salvation for these slaves. Only moving from one slave owner to another do their terms of life change. The cruelty and punishments that they endure simply as a consequence of living can be difficult to watch. The shame and sorrow that the audience may feel during this film is undeniable. The most important thing to take away from that can be taken away from the journey that one has to face during the course of this film is how the enduring legacy of America continues to this day and it is a legacy that has changed the world and continues to ruin people's lives no matter the culture.",10,0,1,24 August 2015
