Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not that strong of a swimmer.
","I went to see this film during it's first release once the hype died down. I left out of the theatre feeling a bit disappointed. Trade embargoes are not interesting. Now that they are replaying on cable, I gave them another chance. One thing I enjoyed about episodes 4,5 and 6, was the sense of the unknown in learning these new languages as they came up. Hearing Greedo, listening to Jabba and Bib Fortuna as they talked in these exotic tongues which draw you in. In episode 1, I felt at times as if I was watching an exploitation film on bad ethnic stereotypes. I won't list specific characters because I don't have to, you know who the Asian sounding characters are. The characters that have Arabic, Latino, and African American stereotypes. I'm not even black and I get offended watching this Jar Jar character say everything but 'he don't know nothing bout birthin no babies.' My last point and question is, 'Where was Haley Joel Osment when they were casting for Anakin?",5,0,1,15 January 2007
