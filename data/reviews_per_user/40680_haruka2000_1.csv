The Blair Witch Project," Anyone who is frightened by this, would be frightened by a toaster.
","This film is over-rated, over-hyped, and lacks any freight whatsoever. Whoever is frightened by this, would be frightened by a toaster.  This film has no thrills, no chills, and nothing that make ones heart skip a beat. Granted it is creepy in some, isolated points, but the film fails to scare.Furthermore, the film plays out like and episode of MTV's 'The Real World' set in the woods.  If I wanted to see 'The Real World,' I wouldn't have quit watching MTV in the first place.  The actors annoy to no end, and, for every given scenario, they end up doing the dumbest action possible.  Simply put, there is no way anyone could care about these three people.To make matters worse, the film is predictable.  Everything is telegraphed a minimum five to ten minutes in advance.  The villain is totally under developed, and the famous stick figures add absolutely nothing to the film.",1,2,4,14 June 2000
