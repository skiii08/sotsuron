United 93," The Audience Was As Scary As The Film!
","Let me start by saying, I loved this film. But I found the audience reaction almost as disturbing as the film itself.I expected the audience to cheer when the passengers first rushed the hijackers. But I was not prepared for was the blood-lust the film inspired in the audience -- they burst into applause when the passengers began stabbing the second hijacker with knifes and forks. Yes, they were fighting for their lives, but come on! And at that point, a man near the front stood, arms outstretched, and began wailing 'THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!' to the screen until the end credits, despite other audience members screaming at him to sit down, shut up, you're crazy, etc.And this is a supposed 'sophisticated' audience in Century City!! I wonder how it will play in Kokomo, Indiana!!",8,1,6,1 May 2006
