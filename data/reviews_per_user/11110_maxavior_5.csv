Blade Runner 2049," Original Blade Runner was really one amazing Vangelis 'music video'
","<ul><li>did you not know that Mr. Villeneuve ;-) An intricate emotional, atmospheric and philosophical journey.</li></ul>Blade Runner 2049 emulates some of the universe, but falls extremely short on the above mentioned elements. It's unevenly paced, poorly edited, like a string of individual scenes from different movies, with only little connection or common thread. Sometimes quiet and then suddenly extremely loud !? Slow scenes can be amazing if you put substance in them that elicit thoughts, emotions or drive the story forward â€“ this was just 'slow doing nothing' in many scenes and therefore boring and long. Some scenes are extremely beautiful and well-made but others look like they are from another movie. And making the blade runners into '2D' killer- or adult robots is just sad. I love Ryan Gosling, but 3 hours of Ryan Gosling playing Ryan Gosling is a bit too much. I just did not care for anyone in the movie!The blatant product placement was like 'flag scenes' in the 80ties and 90ties, awkward and reminding the audience that You are for saleÂ… same problem in Sicario sponsored by the tobacco industry ;-)Please make Directors cut cut cut.",6,7,14,10 October 2017
1917," So much walking........
",Just put it on 4 times speed - enjoy the many many types of walking - stop 2-3 times for story. A quick 25 minutes fix ;-),5,4,9,19 March 2020
Parasite," If you like architecture and overacting.
","To all of you with the high rating - You liked the house didn't you!? be honest - it was the architecture, wasn't it?Can't be the amateurish overacting...",4,3,8,19 March 2020
Wonder Woman," How did you accomplish to make Robin Wright act poorly !!?
","The positive: amazing ultra slow - give us more of that instead of confusing ultra fast, beautiful CGI. Gadot has a huge potential for passion.The negative: How on earth did you accomplish to make Robin wright, Connie Nielsen and Gal Gadot act so painfully cringe-worthy!? - Not really a Director of people are we? - Staccato dialogue. - Sometimes the realism of war and subtle acting, but mostly slapstick and awful overacting. Do better next time !",5,3,13,1 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Since I'm not allowed to swear ;-)
","Positive: Daisy Ridley is very good, energetic and an actress to watch.Kylo Ren and his voice, his voice, his voice and his red lightsaber – could have made him less pg13 though.The humor was actually quite funny.Harrison Ford in full b-actor-mode was enjoyable.BB-8 is an actor/actress to watch – pure method acting.Negative: Yes, you earned a ton of money only because of the predecessors, but you did make a boring, remake-ish and forgettable movie. Bad editing, score and staccato dialogue from several actors. (BB-8 was right on the money though).The official trailer had me in tears – the movie gave me longings for emotions and presence.When the 'bleep' do you realize, that 4 ultra slow motion scenes are a 1000 times better than 100 split second editing scenes – still so much to learn Abrams/Brandon etcWhy the 'bleep' do you still do the bombastic seventies/eighties score thing. Less is so much more so much more.Did you sneak in a black person for the business of it. You should have made Chewbacca more Asian ;-) Hollywood oh Hollywood – like a small immature child, you just want to make noise in the Universe and get paid. Watched 'Victoria' within a day of watching this, and just put it all into wonderful perspective ;-) You get 5 stars for my childhood memories",5,10,16,23 December 2015
