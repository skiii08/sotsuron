Requiem for a Dream," Ugly. Hideous. Unwatchable. Beautiful.
","Darren Aronofsky is the best current director in the USA... with a runner up to M. Night Shyamalan.This is one of the most unwatchable films I have ever seen. Not unwatchable, as in bad, but unwatchable, as in painful. Every moment of this film you keep wishing the despicable characters would not do what they're about to do, driving themselves farther into addiction. Why does the viewer wish the characters a better fate? Despite them being despicable, we see ourselves in the characters, and fall in love with this. This is a rare feat accomplished by Darren Aronofsky and the actors, especially Marlon Wayans. I remember saying 'Oh NO!' when I caught this film at the underground theater (the Ritz 5, for the locals) in Philadelphia. However, Marlon Wayan proves here that... and this will shock some of you... he can ACT!This is not to say Jared Leto or Jennifer Connelly were not fantastic - they were. However, Marlon is the true standout in the film. Aronofsky is amazing in his filming techniques, much like his colleague, Mr. Shyamalan. Both use camera techniques, close ups, and stories of horror and personal change to create dark, touching films.Most of Americana believe that Shyamalan is the 'dark, intellectual' director in America.To them, I say 'Shyamalan is great... but have you seen Aronofsky?'If you ever want to question your own past, present and future, your own mind, and the fabric of reality itself... watch Aronofsky. We all know that 'Pi' skyrocketed him onto the film scene from pure obscurity.In his first encounter with having a budget, he does the exact opposite than Kevin Smith.Kevin Smith broke onto the scene with a black and white, low-budget film called 'Clerks.' Although his later, bigger budget films have been much better, he returned with the rather pedestrian 'Mallrats.' Funny, yes... but characters you care about? Depth? Texture? 'Mallrats' had none of these.Aronofsky, on the other hand, return from his black a white, low-budget effort, 'Pi', with 'Requiem for a Dream.' This is one of the most powerful, ugly, hideous films ever made. This film should have made a splash at the oscars. Ellen Burstwyn is absolutely brilliant. Marlon Wayans should have been given a chance to act in the way Denzel Washington was after starring alongside Sean Connery. However, it was ignore by most of the mainstream.Regardless of its mainstream reception, nothing can change the fact that this is one of the finest films ever... not for the faint of stomach or heart, but a must see.As you can tell by my review, I rarely can watch this film beginning to end. Its too much. Its too good, too evil, too ugly. However, the fact that Darren Aronofsky has gotten all of this into one film - and a televangelist to boot - speaks volumes.Never forget this anagram:EVANGELIST - EVIL'S AGENT",10,1,2,9 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Fantastic film, fantastic book - Jackson and Tolkien are gold stars.
","When you have two such different mediums as a book and a film, you must take the same story and meld it to the medium. In a book, the author relies on the reader's mind's eye to create the video and the audio inside the gray matter we call a brain. In many cases, the transfer from book to film suffers for this exact reason, with cases too many to number: any of the films based upon Asimov's works come immediately to mind.That is not the case here. Peter Jackson has directed a masterpiece that shows his mind's eye view of the Tolkien classic. Why has he succeeded where so many have failed in this book-to-film quest before? Because his mind's eye, his imagination, are simply incredible.While reading the trilogy as a teenager, then a college student, and an aborted attempt recently (I'll finish, but working full time gets in the way of such pleasures), I had my own vision of the books. Granted, it was much different from Jackson's. However, in many ways, it was the same; upon every reading I return to the wide eyed childhood I loved so much. To my days of playing Dungeons and Dragons after reading the trilogy for the first time, creating my own fantasies. Jackson is clearly living his life long dream in his direction and production of this film. Using a great cast, tasteful special effects, and his imagination, Jackson has created a tapestry of a film that Tolkien himself would have been proud to view.In a trip to Oxford, England I took less than a month ago, I began to understand Tolkien's imagination. The place is filled with history, riddles, and mythology. I went with my father, an Oxford graduate, and heard many stories of his college day lore from the late '60s. As we passed many of Tolkien's traditional spots, I felt history shaking my bones. On top of this, as a tourist destination, you can see many great spots in Oxford... like the garden where Alice in Wonderland was conceived and written.Jackson's view is different than the vision Tolkien had while writing the epic trilogy, but that is the great thing about epics: its all in the mind's eye. Jackson manages to create a film that shows you his mind's eye view, while allowing the viewer of the film to mesh their own view with his. That is why this film succeeds.Hats off to Sir Ian for playing the stoner wizard perfectly, by the way!",10,0,0,9 August 2002
