Iron Man 3," I liked it
","Look as with any movie based off of something, this might have its detractors. I get that. But if I were to rate it on its own, it accomplished its mission. It was loud, it was awesome and most of all it had heart.After the events of the Avengers, Tony Stark is rattled. This is a guy who's made billions on sheer genius and guts and he had to face something, including near death, that he didn't understand. So to have that PTSD tied in with the plot line of the movie makes sense to me. Protecting Pepper Potts by creating a bazillion suits but almost losing Pepper emotionally because of the suits was an interesting dilemma to play at as well. The reason I liked it? well other than the awesomeness of RDJ, this movie had little bits, little touches that I think are missing in a lot of superhero movies these days. 1. ingenuity- what made the first movie great and this one as well, is that Tony Stark is a genius and when he has all the glitz around him, its easy to forget that. But this movie showcased some of that great mind and great heart (despite all his snark to contradict him) to prov it. 2. Heart- If you're familiar at all with The Iron Giant... man this movie has some callbacks to the 1999 gem that I just loved. If you haven't seen it, I would definitely recommend it. 3. Happy Hogan- I liked that Jon Farverau (sp?) decided to still play happy despite not being in the director's chair. He had some great moments and the truth is even if he's only the bodyguard/driver he's one of those people that helps Tony stay human, if that makes sense. plus he's a fan of one of my favorite shows. :) 4. Ben Kingsley- the man is awesome. 5. Pepper Potts- Her character isn't just a damsel in distress but that doesn't stop her from being any less Pepper. 6. The scene in the trailer with all the suits- just as awesome as imagined. There are a few things that I can see why people don't like it 1. Unless you've been heavily involved in the whole of the marvel universe, its kind of easy to get lost watching this. Not so much like the Harry Potter movies where you can't just pick it up and get it, but there are still some moments where it would help to know and see the previous films. I mean yeah the end credits help by giving you an overview but still, it could be a bit of a detractor 2. Like I mentioned before, if you are a superfan of the comics, you might not like how some of your beloved characters are portrayed. I mean there are certainly things I would have liked to have seen, but I get why the filmmakers went this route, and I enjoyed it. All in all I think it was a vast improvement over Iron Man 2 and a good way to close the trilogy, if that's the plan. I mean after avengers 2 they could find someone else buttt this last one sets a pretty high bar. Watch it, enjoy it and please get that this is a superhero movie, thats what was set out to be made, nothing more nothing less. :)",9,7,23,26 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Great sequel
","In my years of being a movie goer, there have been very few movies that have surpassed the quality of the first. Not to say the first star trek was bad, but this had the chance to be a repeat of the first but instead it was the continuation of the story with hints of the first. Sure JJ Abrams level of paranoia was kind of ridiculous and I kinda knew what would happen but none of that mattered. He steered the movie into ways that made complete character and story sense. On top of all that, it looked amazing in IMAX 3D. Many movies that go the 3D route are headachy and a mess but this was awesome. If there was one complaint I had, some of the 'science' looked fishy. I mean I get it, it's science fiction but come on, as our society moves forward would it be so wrong to have science that isn't there to just look cool?Other than that I loved every minute of it. Chris pine and Zachary Quito are amazing and I can't wait for the next one.",10,6,14,7 June 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Best movie of the Year.
",I LOVE this movie. I mean I love the books so I was a little hesitant when I heard the reports of the film makers having changed it so much. I was very surprised that the changes actually made me like the movie even more! I mean they stuck true to what CS Lewis originally thought up. Only adding to the story to help with the baseline. Even cooler is the fact that this stands alone as a great movie and people can stop comparing it to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. It can stand alone in movie History as another great addition to the fantasy genre. And regarding the fear that it might be too 'Christian' as a lover of the series and A Christian I was also pleasantly surprised that the film makers didn't detract from the original allegory without stressing too much on the fact that its not a Christian movie. The story is an allegory. I saw the context but that doesn't mean that it should only be seen for that. It's a wonderful story and and a wonderful movie that every one should watch. I just hope the filmmakers are smart enough to make all seven.,10,2,4,10 December 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An expected treat
","Having been a fan of Peter jackson's since the Frighteners, I am well aware that when you are going to see a peter Jackson film expect a certain amount of great visuals and expect great acting even if the story line tends to suffer a tiny bit. So I wasn't surprised going into the Hobbit that I would come out a fan because Peter Jackson delivered as expected. He showed some new scenery of New Zealand and he got the absolute perfect company of dwarfs and goblins and orcs and hobbits. Also there was a return to the familiar with some well placed return characters of Gandalf, old Bilbo,Frodo, Galadriel, Elrond, Saruman and Gollum. What I loved and why I would recommend it? 1. The company of Dwarfs. Each and everyone of them are identifiable, even if you can't get the name of them right, each actor brings something that makes each dwarf memorable and lovable. Their camaraderie makes the drama believable and their humor lovable. (keep watch for some excellent choreography amongst them in song and fight scenes) 2. Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield. He has a really cool gravitas that just makes him larger than life. I mean seriously you watch him and you forget that he is in fact a dwarf and there are creatures of middle earth taller then him. Also his love and protectiveness of his fellow dwarfs. There is a scene where it looks like a few of them might be lost and when they are not the look of heartbreak to relief was spot on. 3. Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Gosh... I can see why Peter Jackson worked the filming schedule around for him. If you are a Sherlock fan definitely watch his performance here. He just has a knack for making any character he plays vulnerable and heroic and lovable. 4. The themes of the story- While the plot points of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are similar (a quest, a stop at Rivenddell, etc) The differences that make this story unique are what make it fun. what I wasn't too crazy about... 1. The length and the slight Deus Ex Machina feel to the end scene. Not having read the Hobbit I don't know if what happens in the last scene exists in the book but having watched the Lord of the Rings and been slightly bothered then as well... I can't help it, I was slightly bothered.All in all if you are a fan of Lord of the rings and want to revisit Middle earth, definitely watch it. Plus... if you are watching it within the first two weeks in IMAX 3D( i think thats how long its on for)the first 9 minutes of star trek is an awesome treat.",9,5,15,15 December 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Like an unofficial reboot
","I love the first M:I movie, it was intense and gritty and action filled. having never watched the show I can't mak any comparisons on how it translated from film to screen but I digress...The second one was a classic John woo movie. As a john woo fan I overlooked a lot of stuff that bothered me because it looked cool.when the third one came around, Tom cruise was going through his crazy phase and nothing in the trailer made the movie look like it was worth seeing. But this one was different. 1. Brad Bird directing his first live action 2. Jeremy Renner groomed to take over the franchise 3. Simon Pegg in a larger role 4. I kind of like the fact that it had a subheading and not M;I4, even if it was the fourth movie.More than anything by the time the third movie rolled around the IMF was too slick so having the ghost protocol initiated and forcing it to be about the four of them it made it a fun action flick but a cool character drama as well. Brad Bird is a great director and while this may surprise many as his first project into live action, think of it as his 'soft opening'. When he gets the backing to do the movie he wants to make the audience will be in for an awesome treat.",8,0,1,21 April 2012
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," I never thought I would say this...
","The Acting saved this movie. As an avid fan of the books and the previous movies I've always had my complaints about the movies. I was particularly concerend about this movie because there was so much material and so many subplots that all seemed relevant that I wondered how it would be done. I agree with the fact that making two movies probably would have cost too much and may have ruined the series (ala matrix) BUT there were a few key details that were integral to the next book that were left out. Without going too much into that, its evident that the acting of the 3 main stars has vastly improved and to be quiet honest this movie would have failed without them. If you watch the movie from the beginning you can see that not only have the characters developed but so have the actors. Their working with very limited material and they do a heck of a good job. I will not say too much of the directing because the previous two directors took many liberties and Mike Newell is no exception. To be quite honest I think it lived up to my expectations and not more. If we want to go into technicality I would give it an 8.7/10 but its just easier to round up.",9,1,1,24 November 2005
The Cabin in the Woods," 'It's like a monet'
","in the classic movie called clueless there is a scene when Cher compares the girl to a Monet. Far away it looks cool but up close its just a big old mess?This movie falls squarely into that category. In theory it works and falls under the whedonverse world of snarky cleverness in it's approach.The reason people have got to stop praising it as this genius commentary of horror movies is because in their effort to pile on homage after homage and still maintain their quick wit they left out a few key factors that make a movie work and the audience is left with a lot of pretty crucial questions. Don't get me wrong, it had its moments. After Fran Kranz dropped the 'stoner' voice that he felt like he needed to have in the first ten minutes of the film, his natural charm helped make the character likable. Brian White showed the moral conflict for a guy working a new job that is just weird.But everything else kind of floundered. You can say that it was too clever for its own good. Maybe if it didn't revert to the 'it's awesome because the whedonverse says its so' reason for doing things, then people can see the holes that exist. And if some can poke so many holes in the movies plot, doesn't that mean it's not as good as it is made out to be? The worse thing about it is the ending. On the one hand it is genius because after the many twists and turns the movie has already made it turned it around once more, just for kicks. At the same time, the implications of the ending are really depressing.",3,7,16,18 April 2012
