Requiem for a Dream," One of the best drug-themed movies
","For a period of time, I experienced some of the aspects depicted in Requiem For a Dream. Of course, it's not the first or last movie ever made about drug use, but of all the ones I have seen, it's the only one that ever made me really squirm. Compelling but very hard to watch at times, this is one movie that pulls no punches. I have to say, though, that I didn't perceive its theme as being along the lines of 'here's what will happen to you if you take drugs.' The movie doesn't preach or moralize, it just depicts. I did not find myself pitying the characters, but could not help but empathize with them. First time I saw this film, I watched it with my brother, who's also been around a bit, and who responded much the same as I did. My second viewing was just a couple of nights ago and was only partial (part way in and to the end). My reaction, even though I knew what was coming, was about the same. If you're looking for some feel-good story (like the utterly ridiculous 'Man With the Golden Arm), then go elsewhere, but if you can handle it, 'Requiem' will deliver the goods.",9,0,1,13 January 2010
