Sucker Punch," What have I been watching?
","Did I see a bad remake of Kill Bill? Did I see a bad WWII movie? Did I see a bad Manga movie? Did I see a bad remake of Fifth Element? Did I see badly used Matrix effects? Did I see a bad remake of The Lord of the Rings? What did I see?! The story was such a big mess. There was no way to find a logical pattern in it. It just didn't make any sense. If only there were some writers to correct this way of movie making. Well, we can see that making enough commercials about this movie makes people go to the movies. If I were 13 years old, I'd think I like it. Just like a 13 year old girl would like to see the Justin Bieber movie. I think that this movie was not made for somebody like me.This movie was simply a waste of my time. now that I'm thinking about it, why am I wasting my time on this review ;)Boris out!",1,10,20,31 March 2011
Inglourious Basterds," This movie is simply beautiful
","For all those who think you should not mess with history, you are wrong! When you only look at the opening titles and see 'western-style' letters to show us the cast, you know that this will not be 100% history facts. This means that you will see a movie that is imagination of the movie creators. If you want to see facts on the WWII go and look at documentaries at History channel or the Discovery channel.The scenes are fantastically dramatic and they used some great humor in there too. When you look at the violence, you can say that it's horrifying, but it's also good to be scared or shocked every once and a while.The use of the languages is also very well done. Beautiful French, German and English sentences. I didn't hear the Italian part that much, because I was laughing to much at the jokes they made about it. So I will have to get back on that.I enjoyed every minute of this movie! Note to the movie creators, of course it wasn't only Tarentino alone, great work on this movie!",10,3,11,15 September 2009
