Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Much Better than Reported
","Without all of the negative reviews, Star Wars fans would have approached the film with unrealistic expectations.  Is this the best Star Wars film yet?  Probably not.  Does it live up to the standard of the Star Wars saga?  Absolutely.  It is true, that if you don't care for Star Wars, you probably won't like the movie.  (If you don't care for beef, you won't like hamburger either.)  Lucas achieves what is expected through stunning visual effects without the expense of good storytelling, and the greatest battles won by the most unlikely heroes.  It's everything a Star Wars film is supposed to be.  The action is a bit slow at first, but builds to a strong climax.  The only complaint:  Lucas needs to let his actors read the whole script. In places it seems the actors don't know where the story was going or where it had been.  This is rare however, and doesn't interfere with the overall enjoyment of the film",9,0,0,19 May 1999
