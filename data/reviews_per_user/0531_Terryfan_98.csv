The Avengers," The Avengers Have Finally Come Together
","The Avengers: Iron-Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye have come together on the big screen.Now before you watch the Avengers it's important that you watch Iron-Man, Iron-Man 2, The Incredible Hulk (2008), Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger so you could understand and follow the story line that plays out in The Avengers since the five movies I just named play into the Avengers.The plot centers around Loki Played by Tom Hiddleston looking to raise a army with the power of the Tesseract, once he takes it into his hands this leads SHIELD Director played by Samuel L. Jackson along with Agents Phil Coulson Played by Clark Gregg and Maria Hill Played by Cobie Smulders to enlist the help of The Avengers with Captain America played by Chris Evans, Iron-Man Played by Robert Downey Jr, Thor Played by Chris Hemsworth, Bruce Banner/ Hulk Played by Mark Ruffalo, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow Played by Scarlett Johansson and Clint Barton/Hawkeye Played by Jeremy Renner.But things don't go exactly as Fury hoped as ego and pride begins to take hold of the team.Now to be honest with you it took me two watches before I could give it a better appreciation because normally when you have a lot of characters from different movies in one crossover it doesn't take one watch to understand it all since you have them in one film.But now that I have watched it quite a few times I have to say the film did a very good job with giving each character equal screen time as well as their own scenes before they would have to be introduce together for the rest of the film.Many fans of Marvel will be happy to see their favorite heroes united into one film which is not something you see everyday and it is well appreciated.And I like how the film choose Loki to be the main antagonist and when you see the film you will understand fully since Loki is Thor's brother it helps the plot and story of the film.The action in the Avengers is very well thought and well done with each hero getting their own spot at making it big on the film it goes to show what imagination and lot of luck will do for you if you take the time.The plot in the film is very good as well with strong performances by each actor who wanted to make sure the Avengers got the respect it deserved so good job everyone.The music also is very good and each score in the film tells the story of the scene in the film so very good work on the music for the film.With everything the Avengers has going for it, it is worth noting that some things could have been better but overall nothing too much to complain about.Many fans have been waiting for this crossover for some time and they won't be disappointed with Thor, Hulk, Captain America and Iron-Man all joining forces for the big screen so Marvel delivers pretty well on this one.Overall The Avengers is a well deserved movie for Marvel fans and doesn't let down the fans what so ever. If you're looking for a good comic book movie with many legends this is your film.I give The Avengers an 8 out of 10",8,3,8,1 February 2015
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash
",Now before you all think I'm bashing this film. This film did have some moments that made it worth while.However it just didn't feel all that to me. Now I didn't see the 2003 Hulk film so don't think this review is getting this rating for that. The Incredible Hulk feels like a reboot and when you watch the film you'll understand where I'm coming from and this is the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.What I found disappointing about the film is that the story telling feels weak and it more or less just don't feel right. The casting is a hit and miss Edward Norton Liv Tyler Tim Roth Tim Blake Nelson Ty Burrell William Hurt all have been cast to play in this film with of course Stan Lee's cameo plus if you watch the end credits you'll get a special cameo from Robert Downey JR. Some of the acting is pretty good other times it just feels vain. Not that these are bad actors it just the script feels like a mess.The music in the film is rewarding and Marvel Films can always be counted on to have a superb score and this film does exactly like that. The main highlight of the film for me is the special effects are very impressive so that is rewarding to watching this film a Hulk vs Abomination in the climax of the film is the main rewarding feature to me in the film and they gave us an incredible fight that should be rank up there with the best of them in the MCU. So while this film does some features to make it a watch it just not something for everyone unless you're a fan of Hulk and Marvel. It just a decent film is the best way I can put it but it does have something.I give The Incredible Hulk an 6 out of 10,6,0,0,12 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Mix results even today
","Now as many of you know I'm a fan of Star Trek but I took the time to watch some Star Wars and I want to review the films so I started at the beginning of the prequels before moving onto the original trilogy which the only one I seen in full was A New Hope.I remember how much hype and talk that went on with this new movie along with ties in such as toys, books, video games and so on. I only saw this movie a few times mostly just bit and pieces and sometimes during school when they would play the VHS copy during breaks.To be honest I couldn't really enjoy it back than because it did have a lot of seriously moments that make you go what were they thinking? Again I'm not 100 percent in touch with Star Wars. But I know a good share of it.So let's not delay any more and move onto the review of Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace.The film starts off with the tradition text roll and we are introduce to our protagonists Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson). We also are introduce to Queen Amidala/Padme (Natalie Portman) Young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) among others as well as Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Frank Oz reprising their roles as C-3PO, R2-D2 and Master Yoda respective We are also introduce to Darth Maul (Ray Park) the film main antagonist and his slight alone is enough to give you nightmares.What I find mostly disappointing about this film is that a good percent of the film is spend just slow pace along with most of the characters feeling out of place as you have to be a fan of Star Wars to understand them, some of the writing just feels a mess.But what's good about the film is the music is very well balance as John Williams shows that his music is why Star Wars fans love it because anything he touches is a gold brick, Portman's performance was good enough and help made her character convincing, the pod race scene was really good it gave you that feel of watching a real race, plus the climax is what fans would want in a Star Wars film. It just so much of this film just feels out of pace but Star Wars will appreciate it none the lessI give Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace an 6 out of 10",6,0,3,2 July 2015
The Longest Yard," Still the Longest Yard
","When I went to the theaters in 2005 to go watch The Longest Yard, I had no knowledge that the film was actually a remake. But this remake does a good job on it own to be a stand out movie.I saw this one twice in theaters which is not something I also do unless I really enjoy the movie enough to go see the movie again in theaters.And this is one of the funniest comedies I seen in a long time and I still remember how everyone in the theater laugh so loud in the theater it's just not something you see too much. The cast is a mix of comedy actors,Former NFL Players and Pro Wrestlers . Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Burt Reynolds, Nelly, Michael Irvin, Bill Goldberg, Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, Walter Williamson, Terry Crews, Bob Sapp,Nicolas Turturro, Dalip Singh,Lobo Sebastian, William Fichtner, Bill Romanowski, Brian Bosworth, James Cromwell and many more I just list the ones whose character plays the most important to the film plotNow this being a sport comedy they had to make it interesting enough to make it worth your time and it does that. Though there are some bits you would be better off not paying attention to The Longest Yard actually does a lot of things to make it a stand alone movie which most remakes don't do all that often.This film is full of drama and humor and quotes that you'll find yourself using after watching it. If you're a football fan or comedy fan do yourself a favor watch The Longest Yard it is full of a lot good.Surprising good acting, smart comedy and a plot that matches the story you'll be in for a good film I give The Longest Yard an 9 out of 10",9,0,0,28 June 2015
Iron Man 3," Iron-Man 3
","Following into the footsteps of The Avengers which has been a very successful film we have Robert Downey Jr returning as Tony Stark better known to the world as Iron-Man. Along with Gwyneth Paltrow reprising her role as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle returning as Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes.This time he now has to do with The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who is out to get Iron-Man and everything he holds dear.Now where fans can complain and I have to agree the plot of the film could have been better there is just so much that could have been better about Iron-Man 3What was good about the film was that the cast did a well done job with their performances Robert shows how he was born to play Tony Stark I can't see anyone pulling off Iron-Man better than him, Ben Kingsley make a interesting villain his performance is just insane in this film. Don and Gwyneth did well also.I enjoy the music score for the film as well it deliver once again in Marvel Studios. The special effects are really good as well which makes the film worth watching.However the film suffer from lack of imagination and the script for the film just feels like it was rush after the Avengers was made so Marvel could cash in on more of the characters from the series.Iron-Man 3 is watchable it just going to be better not to have high hopes on it. I give Iron-Man 3 an 7 out of 10",7,0,3,1 May 2015
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Back for a fourth round
","Seeing this movie in the theaters was wild for me and I'm glad I did see it in the theaters because it turn out to be right up there with the other three Resident Evil movies Milla Jovovich returns as Alice with Ali Larter back as Claire Redfield, Wentworth Miller plays Chris Redfield, Claire's brother. Shawn Roberts plays Albert Wesker in the movie and I think he is a better Wesker also Sienna Guillory returns as Jill Valentine as a bonus for the movie The Story takes place some time after the third movie, Umbrella has take cover underground in many cities of the world, Albert Wesker the main villain of the games and movie is seen taking charge of the base in Japan.Alice and her clones from the last movie attack the base force Wesker and his men to take action.When the real Alice confronts Wesker he strips her of her powers making her human again.Sometime later Alice and Claire join forces again to find a prison with other survivors.However with a army of zombies around the prison and a Axeman things become worst for the survivors.I feel like this movie really was a stepping stone for the series and should be right up there with movies based off video games Survival horror or other wise.I enjoy the action and fighting in the movie and the plot twist in the movie really keep you guessing.All in all if you love Resident Evil then this is your movie.I give Resident Evil Afterlife a 8 out of 10",8,3,7,13 September 2012
Mulan," Disney has done it again with honor
",Mulan is the 9th film in the Disney Renaissance series after watching it again after so long I found it to be a honorable film despite some things that I didn't enjoy about the filmThe plot centers around the legend of Mulan in China Ming-Na Wen voices Mulan and I really did enjoy her performance as the lead protagonist. Mulan is also guided by Mushu (Voiced by Eddie Murphy) and Cri-Kee (Voiced by Frank Welker)The other cast of characters we get Captain Li Shang (Voiced by BD Wong) as the second protagonist the main antagonist is Shan Yu (voiced by Miguel Ferrer) with the rest of the cast beingHarvey Fierstein as the voice of Yao Gedde Watanabe as the voice of Ling Jerry Tondo as the voice of Chien-Po James Hong as the voice of Chi-Fu Soon-Tek Oh as the voice of Fa Zhou June Foray as as the voice of Grandmother Fa Pat Morita as the voice of The Emperor of ChinaI have to say the visuals here are top notch Disney can almost always be counted on for having such amazing visuals and Mulan is no different. To match the visuals is the animation which is well done I always enjoy hand drawn animation it really gives you respect for the art work in this film plus how the artist study the landscape of China.The voice acting is very good and there is a lot of passion in the cast performances. The music is just superb which helps to tell the story. And of course we have the songs the best song to me is 'I'll make a man out of you'.The film had some moments that could have been do without but still Mulan does offer a lot of good to outweigh the badOverall Mulan is just a enjoyable movie with a strong female hero.With strong animation very good voice work and amazing visuals this would be the film for you.I give Mulan a 7 out of 10,7,1,1,17 November 2015
Star Trek," Star Trek Returns
","2005 was a bad year for Star Trek fans when you look at the events of that time you will understand. I fell out of Star Trek because of those events while I did still watch some Star Trek it just those events of 2005 really hurt my passion for the series.Then 2009 came around and we get our first Star Trek film in seven years to come to the theaters and it saved my passion for Star Trek and restarted the fire along with creating a new generation of fans.This reboot really did help Star Trek that only fans would understand. The film features a fresh cast of actors playing the characters from the original series we have Chris Pine playing the role of Captain James T.Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Mr.Spock, Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy 'Bones,Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Simon Pegg as Scotty, John Cho as Sulu, Anton Yelchin as Chekov.We also see Bruce Greenwood as Christoper Pike along with a special appearance Leonard Nimoy who reprises his role as Mr.Spock. The film main antagonist is Nero played by Eric Bana and Nero has been voted as one of the best villains of Star Trek and Eric brought a new level to the role that is best given justice by watching the film.The cast really did well as the characters in this reboot I feel some of the cast honor the characters that Star Trek fans grew up with.Also the special effects in the film are simply impressive and you can tell they took the time to deliver on making the film a thrill for the fans and new fansMusic in the film is really good as the score tells the story of each scene in the film.The plot of the film really did well as it's better to watch the film to give it justice the film does well with pleasing Star Trek films with the Easter eggs in the film that you have to be a fan to love Action and stunt scenes are very good as well the film that makes the film work well for the reboot side and they took the time to detail the fights It's good to see a film like this give Star Trek another chance to shine.Overall if you're a long time fan of Star Trek or are looking for a action film that is a epic ride this is your filmWith good action, creative plot and talented performances this film should be pleasing to any one who loves movies I give Star Trek (2009) an 8 out of 10",8,2,4,12 June 2015
Iron Man 2," Took me some time to give Iron Man 2 respect
","Now I'll admit it took me years six years to be exact to give Iron Man 2 a better opinionBecause when I first watched the film I couldn't appreciate plus at the time I wasn't impress because it didn't feel like it lived to the standards the first movie has set.But after so much time I felt like I could give it a better opinion. After buying the movie on DVD I got to say it is one of those movies that had to age to be appreciated.While it is not a superior sequel it is still a enjoyable movie with some things that make it work and some not so much things that will make it work.The film centers this time on new cast of characters along with developing them as the film goes on which helps make it work.Iron Man 2 story took some time to get a grip of where this was going and what was happening to the characters that you have to be pay close attention to or else you'll miss something.The acting in the movie is up and down where some of the cast doing well and making the film work despite some flaws in the script There is some very original quotes in the movie which I liked and they help make the movie fun.The music in the movie works helps with the movie and some songs that movie fans know from the first note they heard it. There are impressive special effects which you would come to expect in Iron Man and Marvel movies they spare no expense with the effects it really goes to show that with a little talent and a lot imagination you can create some impressive workIt just this sequel took time to enjoy and the fact some of the flaws can hurt the movieBut with good acting, impressive effects and characters you'll find it to be just as good as the other line ups in the Marvel Cinematic UniverseI give Iron Man 2 an 8 out of 10",8,0,1,4 April 2016
World War Z," A Disgrace to Zombie movies
",Now I know I'll be some getting some disagreements but this is how I feel about the film.One that everyone loves but I don't.I mean I don't see how this is even consider a great film I mean it's not even worth the film it was recorded with.IN my opinion it was made just for Brad to collect another pay check I'm not saying he's a bad actor but clearly he didn't think this one through.The zombies are even hardly consider zombies it just another Hollywood trying to catch in on a book.The story of the film is just the same one we have heard many times before and it just pretty much gets boring as it goes on.Clearly this film was made to make some money and it might have done well at the theaters but it was pretty much a disgrace to horror and zombie films out there.Again it's just another film that everyone loves but I don't. World War Z just has a big name star trying to save the world and his family but he couldn't save the boredom of the fans of movies.I give World War Z an 1 out of 10,1,5,10,18 February 2015
Zootopia," Zootopia a must see Disnye Movie
","Zootopia is perhaps the most original movie we have seen from animation in quite a long time and when I went to see this in theaters I was still impress with what Disney did for this movie.The characters are a huge part of the movie and each one of them helps brings the story to life in their own right and there are hardly any useless characters in the movie and the cast they have voicing them did a impressive jobJudy Hopps voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, Nick Wilde voiced by Jason Bateman,Chief Bogo voiced by Idris Elba, Bellwether voiced by Jenny Slate,Clawhauser voiced by Nate Torrence,Gazelle voiced by Sharkia, Mayor Lionheart voiced by J.K.Simmons, along with the rest of the cast John DiMaggio, Gita Reddy,Tommy 'Tiny' Lister,Don Lake, Bonni Hunt Alan Tudyk, Octavia Spencer and others. The plot of the movie is not something you would expect from a Disney movie but the theme of the movie really teaches a important lesson which really is one of the greatest points of the movie was the plot took a huge risk and yet it work out very well it goes to show what happens when you put a good writing team together.The voice acting is superb the cast really gave some of the best performances in animation which is the key to a successful movie I mean it's hard to pick which one did the best because they put their emotions into the performances of the characters.The Comedy in the movie helps the story though some of the jokes I will admit are the most corny and could have been better and some that were better on paper but that don't take away from what drives the movie home with movie fans.The animation is just what you expect from Disney always at their best this movie with the characters being animals it's like the artists study each animal to get a understanding of them.Zootopia is a must watch and I would suggest watching it with the family because it droves home with it's message.With superb voice acting, excellent animation and a story that is what you don't see from Disney this is a must watchI give Zootopia an 8 out of 10",8,2,5,10 September 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Into Darkness
","Now as a long time fan of Star Trek, I was looking forward to seeing this film and it was really awesome to watch in theaters.After the success of the 2009 Reboot of Star Trek, you know fans would want a sequel and we got one that boldly goes where no one has gone before, Into Darkness.The cast from the 2009 film reprises their roles Chris Pine as Captain Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Mr.Spock, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, Karl Urban as Dr.McCoy aka Bones, Simon Pegg as Scotty, John Cho as Mr.Sulu, and Anton Yelchin as ChekovWe are introduce to new cast members Alice Eve as Dr.Carol Marcus and her father Marcus played by Peter Weller. The Film main antagonist is John Harrison who is played by Benedict Cumberbatch and his performance is a winner in this film his voice also commanded your attention. Peter's character is also a commanding figure as well.The effects for this film are superb it just proves that Star Trek is one of the true masters of wowing their fans with their special effects and to give them justice you have to watch the film.The acting in the film is well balance as well as the story that is truly like it's subtitle into darkness as Star Trek has done it sometimes but this one you have to watch to understand Also the music again is what you would expect from Star Trek and it is just a well done score to match every bit of this film as you feel many emotions from the music.The only complain about this film I have is that it could have done more but we made do with what we got I still praise the special effects the plot and the performances of the cast. Overall if you enjoy Star Trek and are a long time fan I say give this film a tryI give Star Trek Into Darkness an 8 out of 10",8,2,7,2 June 2015
Beauty and the Beast," One of Disney's masterpieces of Animation films
","Beauty And The Beast is one of those films I saw in the 90s and often times during school back when we were allow to watch movies in school if we did well. Anyhow the 1990s were a good decade for animation films and from Disney it was nearly always going to be a promising motion picture. Beauty and the Beast is the third film in the Disney Renaissance series and it is praise for a lot of reasons. For one thing the movie feels like you're watching a play the animators and cast gave us the impression that they set it up like you would be watching a Broadway show and looking at it now I say it is very clever. The animation in this film remains one of my favorites in any animation films because they really did a wonderful job with the backgrounds and the attention to detail goes to show how much they wanted to take the time to make the film magical also the characters are very well design.The voice acting is very powerful each of the cast help bring the story to life and you could tell in their voice work that they were all in for giving their best. Again it feels like you were seeing a play unfold in front of you the cast really did a strong job. Songs written for the film help bring the characters out and the story because you could tell the songs would be hits when the movie came out. Each song does something special to make it well know for Disney fans.Music score in the film is nearly perfect and really helps brings the film to the fold because each piece of music written just does in it own way bring the movie to where it is I just really respect the music and it is one of my favorite movie scores.Overall Beauty and the Beast does a very well done job with making it one of Disney's best motion pictures. With super animation, great voice acting, superb music and a great story you can't not go wrongI give Beauty and the Beast an 9 out of 10",9,1,1,30 October 2015
The Girl Next Door," The Girl Next Door with a lot of pretty girls
","The Girl Next Door was a movie that at first I thought was going to be boring.I was wrong about that, it turn out to be a funny movie.I enjoy the story, the acting, the music, and of course the pretty girls.This is nothing but a fun and entertaining movie.The Girl Next Door has an fun story.This movie never got boring.The Girl Next is very entertaining and just enjoyable.I love all the girls in The Girl Next Door, they're just too sweet! Overall, I enjoy The Girl Next Door for being an fun movie.I give The Girl Next Door 8 out of 10 Great movie!",8,2,3,13 April 2006
The Fifth Element," Crazy interesting
",The Fifth Element is both interesting and crazy to say the least.The film is what the 90s were about in terms of cinema and it is a example how far film making has come in the decade.The film plot centers around the colorful future with Korben Dallas Played by Bruce Willis who works as a cab driver suddenly find himself unwittingly mind you in the middle of the search for a powerful cosmic weapon.When he meets Leeloo Played by Milla Jovovich they both become targets of Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg played by Gary Oldman.Plot wise the film prove to be interest but it does have moments where this don't serve any meaning to the story like Ruby Rhod Played by Chris Tucker honestly his character would have better left out because while Chris is a funny actor this role is not one of his better ones.Often the film also throws a curve ball at you that you don't expect which often enough makes you go 'Really'?Performance wise the cast does well for the most but some of the characters should have been like in the deleted scene.The film itself just has something that make you want to watch it but other times it makes you go 'How did I get into this'? But more or less it's a interesting film just have to watch to understand.I give The Fifth Element an 7 out of 10,7,0,1,2 April 2015
Blade," Half Human/Half Vampire Blade shows how a comic book movie is suppose to be done
","Blade Marvel's Half Human Half Vampire character when he made his film debut in 1998 the film became a hit. While the 1990s were good for cinema and movies there were some comic book films that more or less left a sour taste in movie goers mouths. There were some that were awesome some that were just a disgrace.However Marvel's Blade really show that you can make a good comic book movie, this film just did some very smart moves first they made this a R rated film which for the story and plot in this film, they pick the right cast for the characters and the action is just well done.The plot of the film centers around Blade (Wesley Snipes) and his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) are on a quest to hunt and destroy vampires along with putting a stop to Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) and his minions Quinn (Donal Logue), Mercury (Arly Jover)However things take a change when Karen (N'Bushe Wright) gets bitten by Quinn leaving Blade to be her protector and they form a partnership to put a end to the vampires. The story gives us a look into the origin of Blade and how he became to be which we learn as the plot advances.Also the action and fight scenes were very well balance and had you on the edge of your seat and the way the film starts with the fight in the night club gave us what we would expect during the film it goes to show that they knew what they were doing.Each fight scene is worth watching. Also the film has a good collection of classic lines. Blade just goes to show that it's cool to make comic book movies and in some help restore credit into films based on Comic Books to restore the trust into making hit movies I give Blade an 8 out of 10",8,0,1,24 September 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Nothing can save Wolverine
","I know this is a origins film but come on this is Wolverine we're talking about.Sure we got more characters like Gambit and Deadpool but still this movie wasn't just all that.I mean at least Hugh Jackman is back as Wolverine and there is no one who could pull off being Wolverine in the live action films then him.But other then Hugh Jackman's performance in this film nothing I mean nothing can make this movie special to watch the whole two hours of it.There may be some good action scenes but some of the CGI is not worth it while.I mean Marvel has made some good movies but this not one of them, the story in the film is almost like watching paint dry.They did a real miscasting of Deadpool and Gambit two well known and respected Marvel characters.I mean this movie is just a origin and doesn't help the story of X- men.There is nothing to make me want to watch it again.I give X-Men Origins: Wolverine an 3 out of 10",3,0,2,14 January 2015
Rise of the Guardians," The Rise of Guardians
","Now this is not the kind of film you see everyday. However it did have some let downs for me anyway.Rise Of The Guardians centers around children characters Jack Frost (Voiced by Chris Pine) Santa Claus called North (Voiced by Alec Baldwin) The Tooth Fairy (Voiced by Isla Fisher) and The Easter Bunny (Voiced by Hugh Jackman) along with Sandy The Sandman.They are united to battle Pitch (Voiced by Jude Law).Now that being said my only disappointed by Rise Of The Guardians is the story, while it does have a plot to keep your attention it just don't hold much for me, it just feel like they didn't take time to write out the plot from what I understand the film is based off a children book series but it just don't feel like the story was the main focus of the film but for kids it is easy for them to follow it.Other than that no other complains about the film it is a good one just the story I wish could have been done better.But the voice acting is really well done and I was quite surprise by the cast of actors they had for the film each one brought extra magic to their characters Chris Pine is very good as Jack Frost, Isla Fisher is very good as Tooth and I was surprise that Bunny was voiced by Hugh Jackman but he did a well done job as the character also Jude Law was the right actor to voiced Pitch his performance made Pitch scary, dark and evil.The animation is very amazing the backgrounds are great and very well done character designs with effects from snow to water the animators really took the time to detail every little design about the film so well done Dreamworks. So the only issue I have with Rise of the Guardians is mostly the story but the animation and voice acting redeems it enough to enjoy watching so all together it could have been more but it still fun.I give Rise Of The Guardians a 7 out of 10",7,2,4,31 January 2015
Chicken Run," A real fun family movie
",Chicken Run does everything to make it a fun family motion picture. So there is a good chance you and your whole family will enjoy it.What makes this movie special that it is stop motion. Stop Motion Animation is hardly use these days and it is very good to see a full motion picture with stop motion.The stop motion is very well done and you can see in this film that they took the time to detail every motion of the characters and the sets help make it convincing that is what I like the best about the film is the stop motion it deserves a lot of respect for how the animation was done. The music in the film tells the story pretty well for each scene. The writing in this film does have pretty well and some good reference to famous films and Television shows which is another winner because the writers made each reference work.The voice acting is very well done as well with a cast you never thought would do animation films but they did.The only downside to the film is that some characters will leave you scratching your head and some of the writing can be out there.But overall Chicken Run is a fun film for the whole family and shouldn't be miss I give Chicken Run an 7 out of 10,7,0,1,4 October 2015
Terminator Salvation," A disappointing Terminator film
",If you want to disrespect a film series this would be the way to do it.From the start the film did not feature Arnold Schwarzenegger who without him it's not a Terminator film. There is just somethings you can't do and not having Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Terminator series is one of themPretty much the film drive on special effects which are cool and impressive but these days special effects can only go so far when it doesn't have a story or anything else worth noting about this film.It just a shame that this film has to take something that was always better the way it was but no they had to really damage what made the series a fun one to watch.The plot is unbelievable pretty much couldn't hold my interest also the acting in this film is off the wall so much of a disappointed that they didn't even make the characters believable and they pick some talented actors for the filmJust not for a fan of the Terminator series and really a disappointed and it felt like they insulted the history of the Terminator I give Terminator Salvation an 2 out of 10,2,0,3,27 May 2015
The Jungle Book," Disney's Timeless Classic
","The Jungle Book to this day remains one of my favorite animation films from Disney because I watch it a lot as a kid.The film is just one of those films that is like a fine wine only get better with age and that is what is rare for animation films these days.The Jungle Book has everything you would want in a animated film and this is quite rewarding from start to finish.You got a strong story as Mowgli our main protagonist along with Bagheera must go home to the Man Village before Shere Khan the main antagonist returns to the jungle.Unfortunately Mowgli is not willing to return to his home that's when he meets Baloo. The Jungle Book features a collection of classic characters like Baloo, Bagheera, Kaa, Mowgli and Shere Khan. Each character has a lot of special to the story of the film.The Jungle Book also features superb animation that is very well timed and great backgrounds you can tell Disney took the time to make sure the animation is done right. You can really appreciate the attention to detail in this film.The voice acting is phenomenal. The cast really brought these characters to life and you can really enjoy the film for that.Also the music is pure classic with my two favorite songs being 'The Bear Necessities' which I used to get up and move along with the song because Baloo made the song a hit 'I wanna be like you' Is my other favorite for the beats and the lyrics it just goes to show how you can make great music in a film.The Jungle Book has it all, wonderful animation, timeless characters and superb story telling, humor, action and drama there is no way you can go wrong with the Jungle BookI give The Jungle Book an 10 out of 10",10,0,1,30 March 2015
Deadpool 2," Worthless Sequel
","Deadpool 2 is a example of what happens when you make a sequel and don't care. It makes you wish that you get up and leave the theater because there is nothing that can make Deadpool 2 worth watching.When I saw the movie in theaters I like everyone else expected a sequel that could've topped it first movie but nope it didn't even come close as a matter of fact everything about Deadpool 2 proves to have been a total waste of time and a waste of my hard earn money.The acting in the movie is beyond awful it felt like no effort went into making the movie it shows that the cast was only doing the movie to get a paycheck and it just one of those movies where they clearly didn't care.The music in the movie is enough to make you cover your ears and the comedy isn't worth it.I could write a book about how bad this movie is but it would be a waste of good paper because there is nothing worth while about Deadpool 2 that even a dollar theater would find it worth playing.
It is just real bad comedy and do yourself a favor and avoid at all costI give Deadpool 2 a 1 out of 10",1,86,219,24 June 2018
X-Men," Perfect X-sample of how to make comic book movies
","Now as a kid I grew up with the 1990s X-Men Animated series and of course it made me a fan of X-men. Of course read the comic books when I can.I remember getting X-Men for Christmas and it remains one of my favorite movies based off Marvel Comics.X-men is the first of the live action X-men motion pictures and the series has been interesting to say the least but you have to be a fan of X-Men to enjoy and appreciate itThe start of the film begins with Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) narrating how mutants are created'Mutation: it is the key to our evolution. It has enabled us to evolve from a single-celled organism into the dominant species on the planet. This process is slow, and normally taking thousands and thousands of years. But every few hundred millennia, evolution leaps forward.' That is the start of the film and it is enough to get your interested.The plot of the film centers around the X-Men as they try to fight for human/mutant peace but Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) is determined to prevent this from happening. Which leads to Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his Brotherhood of Mutants with Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), Toad (Ray Park) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) to begin a war.But the X-Men Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry) will not allow itBut then once new mutant Rogue (Anna Paquin) comes into the picture it leads to her being protected by Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) it leads to learning how she could turn the tie in the war between the X-men and Brotherhood of Mutants.As the plot goes on you see more of how Rogue will serve more to the plot then you would expect and how Wolverine relates to the other members of the X-Men. X-Men is just one of the films that actually did something right sure it didn't hit every note right but it is still a strong film.The film feature a strong plot that holds your attention from the story of the film.Music in the film is superb as Michael Kamen made a powerful score and each piece of music helps tell the story of the film along with each scene get it own score to help move the film. The cast was pretty strong as casting Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman were the right picks for Professor X and Wolverine. The cast each brought something to the table of the film.X-men is just one of my favorite films of Marvel Comics and if you enjoy Comic books films then this one would be right up your alley.With strong plot, powerful performance it is hard to past this one up.I give X-men an 10 out of 10",10,0,0,20 April 2015
Spider-Man 3," How dare
","I have not written about a movie is a long while, I saw Spiderman 3 not long ago.So I thought I would give my opinion on this movie.I have always been a fan of the Marvel comic and Spiderman is one of my favorites.The first movie in my opinion was and still is the best movie in this series.I saw Spiderman 3 with my brother and a friend of mine.I try to be fair to every movie I watch because I'm a huge movie fan and I just like to enjoy a movie.Now This movie show my favorite Spiderman Villain Vemon, Vemon in my opinion is just pure evil.The Sandman, I'm a fan of villains who have some of their human sides still with them, The Sandman at first I never heard of this villain but trust me this dude is unstoppable.I like this movie but the only thing I hated about it was that dumb dance in the movie, I thought 'Oh brother, Spiderman you're a hero not a show off'.Overall It's not the best movie but it has a cool story, well done Villains and heroes, funny jokes and excellent action.I give this Spiderman a 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,30 May 2007

","Once again Alice (Milla Jovovich)is place in a quest for survival from the undead created by Umbrella's T-Virus. To make matters worst her powers have become more dangerous for her to use.This time however she is a loner trying to stay away from others as often as she could because she is scared that anyone she comes close to would be place in danger.Dr.Isaacs (Lain Glen) has been creating clones of Alice to learn more about her powers and how to improve on it only if he can convince Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) (Personally I don't think Jason was a good wesker whatsoever).

Both going through the challenges such as Alice's new powers and Claire's role as the leader of a convoy.All in all still a very good movie in the series if you're a fan of the series so I would give it a recommendation.I give Resident Evil:Extinction a 8 out of 10",8,1,2,12 September 2012
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man has come home
","Spider-Man Homecoming puts our friendly neighborhood super hero back where he belongs. I'm going to keep this review free of spoilers. After the successful run of the first Spider-Man Trilogy 2002-2007 and the ridiculous 2012 Reboot series we got a film that this time makes you feel like you really are in Spider-Man's world.We also get to see what happens to him following his role in 'Civil War'. What makes the movie good is that it is not a reboot more like showing how Peter Parker has been Spider-Man for a while now and shows how his life has been since then as he still struggles with problems as a Super Hero and life in school and so one. It actually feels like a test of character for Spider-Man/Peter Parker in this movie. But he also must deal with a new comer in town The Vulture.The action scenes in the movie are pretty tense and action pack that will make you go Wow. It was like they timed each scene to prepare you for the fight to comeThe story just holds your interest from the moment the film starts. The comedy in this movie really out did itself while some jokes were kind of out of place the rest of the jokes will leave you laughing for which Spider-Man has been known to have a sense of humor so smart thinking for the comedy.The music is good as well and helps drove the story.The best performances for the movie goes to Tom Holland as Spider-Man/Peter Parker who after his performance in 'Civil War' restore the hope that we will have a better Spider-Man movie and he did a very good job, Micheal Keaton as Adrian Toomes/Vulture really was great as the main antagonist each time he was on screen it was bound to be trouble Michael's performance shines in this movie. I have to rank him as one of Marvel Climactic Universe best villains. Robert Downey Jr reprise his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man and his performance works for the movie. Marisa Tomei as Aunt May Marisa is a rare actress where anything she touches is gold and she was good for her role in the movie. The movie does have some problems mostly some characters feel out of place and should have not been in this movie one character was better not to have at all in the film also the end credit scene had everyone in the theater more or less in Awe and disgust. It was just a bad move on the film maker's part to have a wasted end credit scene but it is what it is. And again some jokes felt flat.But those flaws are not going to ruin your joy of watching this movie that helps proves Marvel has does it again and that Marvel prove they can restore one of their biggest characters to his original glory. I give Spider-Man Homecoming an 9 out of 10",9,35,65,7 July 2017

Hobbs has a new partner Riley (Gin Carano) as well.The movie took action and stunts to a whole new level and that they were bringing everything to the screen planes, fast cars and they got a tank wow.They used a good amount of humor as well which helps out as well.This is the fourth Fast and Furious movie I saw in theaters and really am proud to saw I loved it.So I recommend any fan of movies and cars to see this movie.I give Fast and Furious 6 an 8 out of 10",8,7,11,31 December 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America The Winter Soldier, Marvel gives us a wild thriller action film.
","Now I want to be honest I didn't care too much for the first Captain America film It just didn't seem to much for me so I was mix about the sequel but lucky this film is one of those rare times where the sequel is far superior to the original. The Winter Soldier is much superior in more ways than oneI'm happy to say this film really is what a Captain America film should be and it is close to being one of Marvel's best films and it has become one of my favorites.Captain America The Winter Soldier goes to show that Marvel is a genius when it comes to movies based on their flagship characters and this is the third film that follows The Avengers story line.In this film Captain America (Chris Evans) is asked by Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) to help Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) in a mission for S.H.I.E.L.D. Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) also join forces with themHowever things begins to unfold as Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) enters the picture and once he does, S.H.I.E.L.D. begins to fall, Hydra begins to rise and enters The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). Everything about this film just improve so much over the original film. They took it to make sure it was more like Captain America as we should have seen from the get go. I mean this film hold my attention from the start it contain a powerful plot that was helped by the first season of Agents Of SHIELD which had a series of episodes to help key in with the story. The Winter Soldier prove to be threat to Captain America and a unstoppable force, this proves to be one of the biggest challenges for Captain America as he has more on his plate in this film The writers did a very well done job with the story telling of the film and the plot is one of the finest works I have seen in movies as well with having a good idea to bring Falcon, Nick Fury and Black Widow into the film which helps make the story more believable.The performances from the cast are superb as everyone brought their A game to the table. I enjoy how they kept the humor in the film works when the timing was right. Action scenes and stunts are top notch we see tense fight scenes with Captain America and The Winter Soldier and Black Widow shows that she is a boss when it comes to combat and she can run with the best of them. I just appreciate the fights and the action in the film that's what the first one was missing this one deliver big time so bravo.Music in the film is just superb as Henry Jackman made a well done score each music piece in the film helps sell the story. Captain America The Winter Soldier has proved itself to be worthy of Marvel's work and it is superior in every way to the original. With great acting, excellent action scenes and fight scenes and well thought out story I can say I can watch this movie over and over again.I give Captain America The Winter Soldier an 9 out of 10",9,2,5,30 April 2015
Pacific Rim," Go Big or Go home
","Back in 2013 I begin to see the trailers and previews on TV for Pacific Rim and honestly I was not interested in the film.Here's why when I first saw the trailer I thought it look like a copy cat of Transformers and I am a huge fan of The Transformers.But when I finally sit down to watch it I have to say I was wrong and wrong big time.The film felt like it had a mix of everything that all fans of Robots would love, it felt like Transformers, Voltron, Robotech, Gundam, Macross and many other shows that feature robots. The plot of the film centers around Sea Creatures called Kaijus as they begin to wage war with Humanity but, Humans fight back a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge.That is what makes the film stand out is the original take on the genre.Casting wise they pick Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Ron Perlman to star in the film and they brought their characters to life and were the right choices to help give the film some credit instead of just being called 'Monster movie'. Guillermo del Toro did a superb job as the director of the film and actually shows how you can do a robot movie with justice to those who enjoy films about robots. He actually allow you to appreciate the talent of the filmThe film special effects are top notch everything is spared no expense with the visuals they are just wonderful and so well done it just out of this world how well they took the time to design every thing about the robots and monsters feature in the film that it will make the kid in you roar.To give it justice you have to watch for yourselfThe music is very well match it fits every scene in the film, the cast perform the best they could and brought attention to their charactersThe only drawback about Pacific Rim is that some characters you won't care for and that some of the film can feel let down Overall if you are a fan of Robot films or just curious about how this film plays out then I suggest watch the film for yourself and keep a open mind I give Pacific Rim an 8 out of 10",8,0,1,15 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A much improve film
",Now while I still feel mix about Episode 1 I have to say Star Wars: Episode 2 Attack of The Clones is a much improve film and shows to be one of the best second films in a series.It does have it fair share of highs and lows but it still a much better film in the prequel Star Wars filmsOur three main protagonists are Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Padmé (Natalie Portman). Yoda (Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) also play important roles in the plot of the film along with the mystery around Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid)Our film main antagonist is Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and our second antagonist is Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) It's hard to explain the plot because it's better if you watch the film to understand it more than I could best explain it but never the less it had a story to go into this film. There is some emotional performances in this film as you can see the cast emotions in their characters as they did a good performance in the film. Surprising that they added comedy into the film but I really got a laugh that I had to pause the movie because I couldn't stop laugh then rewind to laugh again.John Williams once again show case his wonderful talent for making superb music he's a man where anything he touches turns to gold he just knows how to tell a story with his music and this film is no different each piece of music helps tell the story of this motion picture. Also the fight scenes are very well done and they really took the effort to make each battle the most rewarding part of watching this film each battle is just really thought out and keeps you on the edge The only draw back is that there are slow down moments in the film and some of the plot is hard to understand but still this film is much improve over the first episodeOverall I really enjoy the film and it shows that with a little work anything can be improve over the last film I give Star Wars:Episode 2 Attack Of The Clones an 8 out of 10,8,6,9,22 July 2015
Corpse Bride," What did I just watch?
","Now now before I make my review I just want to set the record straight I know there are lot of Johnny Deep fans and Tim Burton Fans both men do great at what they do and it has been a while since we got a Stop Motion movie so the more of those we can do the better off we can be.However Corpse Bride is sadly not a movie I would consider to be either good or bad it just one of those movies that left me shocked and appalled and I'm stone cold series about that.But there is quite the powerhouse in the voice acting department Johnny Deep, Christopher Lee,Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson,Tracey Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Albert Finney, Richard E.Grant,Michael Gough, Jane Horrocks and the cast does do some good voice work I'll give it that. The stop motion animation works for the film and in some ways it almost feels that the actors did some motion capture but that's my opinion. But the movie had so many gross moments that make you go 'They put that in a Children's movie'? I couldn't believe at the scenes I saw that were gross to the point I turn away. A good bit of this movie I had to turn away because I couldn't believe at what I saw.I know it's Tim Burton but come on everyone has their limits and this one push me to my limits it just after seeing what I saw in this movie I couldn't believe this movie got away with that. only watch it if you're a fan otherwise it will just make others go What?I give Corpse Bride an 5 out of 10",5,1,3,10 November 2015
Ant-Man," Marvel shows the best things come in small packages
","I'm going to keep this as spoiler free as possible because if you are a fan of Ant-Man or Marvel Comics in general then you need to add Ant- Man to your list of movies to see in the theater. Just goes to show that with the right talents anything can be possible. Marvel Studios once again brings another winner to movie fans because this movie is full all you would want in a motion picture and then some. Also you'll find yourself giving this movie a round of applause which is exactly what everyone in the theater did.Ant-Man tells the story of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) who just been release from prison and looking to regain his trust again with his ex Maggie Lang (Judy Greer) and their daughter Cassie Lang (Abby Ryder Fortson) Things only getting wilder when his friend Luis (Michael Peña) offer him to take part in a heist with help from Kurt (David Dastalchian) and Dave (T.I.) This leads him to a meeting with Dr.Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) where he gets the chance to become the Ant-Man a superhero who can shrink to the size of a ant with special powers. The movie main antagonist is Darren Cross/Yellowjacket (Corey Stoll) the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been on a roll and Ant-Man is no different. Again the film features all you could ask for in a movie: Comedy, Action, Cool Effects and talented performances. The comedy in this film hits off right at the start and it goes on on and on there were times when the theater roar into laughter because they did the comedy very clever to make it not forced but actually funny smart humor went into the movie and it gives the movie goers a real good time. The effects are very impressive and you can't help but be amazed by the effects and what makes Ant-Man work is that they balance them out very wellThe action scenes are awesome and very creative use of stunts and well thought out fightsThe cast did a very good job with the performances of their characters some you can feel for it gives you that connection of you can relate to those characters which not offer times you will see in movies often and the cast really did that good of a jobThe story does a very good job to hold your interesting through out while It is good to have knowledge on the history Ant-Man and the characters I have some history of the character but I went into this movie to find some good entertainment and Marvel deserves a medal for making Ant-Man one of their best films.Is Ant-Man worth the price of a movie ticket to put my answer in one word: YES.

The Bourne Identity," A spy movie that gets your attention
","When I saw to the theater in 2002 I was skeptical about The Bourne Identity because I haven't seen the trailers nor heard of it on TV. But figure it was better than staying at home so why not go see it. Turns out to be a wise choice because this film is worth the time to check it out.It features a creative story that is better to watch to appreciate because you will need to pay close attention to otherwise you'll be lost in the woods.The Bourne Identity does a real original take of the spy movie genre which I like. The way the film starts get you wondering. The crew and cast must have did a lot of research in psychology because they really dig into the psychological of the human mind for a spy film. The cast of Matt Damon, Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Brian Cox made the film really interesting. along with other cast members like Julia Stiles Their performances in the film help makes the characters important without a good cast you can't make a film serious and believe me this film is more than serious enough to hold your interestingPlus the action and stunts in the film really get you on the edge of your seat It did for everyone in the theater and still does on DVD which I owned. It's just amazing how well they dig into the psychology of the human mind this film takes a departure from the Bond films nothing wrong with them but Bourne does a lot more than just be an action movie which it is still but it more to it.The Bourne Identity is unlike many spy movies as this one make for a good mix of psychology and action which makes it quite the filmWith a good cast, tense action and a character driven story this is a movie you should check out I give The Bourne Identity an 9 out of 10",9,2,2,19 June 2015
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Still a good Terminator film
",Say what you want about Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines I still a strong film in the Terminator films yes I still will call the first two masterpieces and it should have not with just Terminator 2 but of course a series like the Terminator it is gonna be made into sequels. Also I'll take Terminator 3 over Terminator Salvation any day. Here's why. The plot in some ways feels like a 'What if' Storyline as The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is send back through time to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl) and Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) from T-X (Kristanna Loken).The film features some extreme action stunts that have you on the edge and it goes to show that the film did a lot to make it feel like Terminator and the fights were pretty intense for this one.The score in the film is pretty strong where the music helps the story of the film.There is a good bit of humor in this film but it don't take away from what the film from what it suppose to be. The special effects are pretty impressive with attention to make them look believable. Yes I know this movie gets a bad rap but if you're a fan of Terminator you should at least give it a shot and it is must better than Terminator SalvationI give Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines an 8 out of 10,8,16,22,8 October 2015

The writers of the story did well with being serious and funny so the whole family can enjoy Over The Hedge.The animation in the film is very well done and shows how well you can use C.G.I. with full details to each character.The voice acting is pretty good and the cast was a interesting mix of many well known actors they did very good bringing life to the characters and make them interesting through the whole film.Over The Hedge is a great film that shouldn't be missed if you love animated films then this one is for you.I give Over The Hedge an 10 out of 10",10,0,0,29 January 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terminator is back with a vengeance
","Now it's easy to say that Terminator 2 is perhaps the greatest sequel ever created and it is a strong reason for it too.Terminator 2: Judgement Day takes everything that make The Terminator great and make it a winner with the sequel.The plot of the film centers around The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been send back in time with a new mission to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong) along with his mother Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) as a new more deadly and more dangerous Terminator T-1000 (Robert Patrick) has been send back in time to kill John.This was the first R rated film I watched as a kid of course I didn't watch the bad bits which looking back was a wise choice since this movie does get extreme at times. Everything about this movie is just superb such as the special effects are still impressive even today and the stunts action scenes remain some of the best ever in a action film. And you will get tense during the action scenes as they really make you believe our protagonists are in mortal danger throughout.Also we get to see well done character development you get to bond with these characters and that's something you don't see anymore. Along with this film giving us the famous catch praise of the 90s 'Hasta La Vista, Baby' even now it is popular along with 'I'll be Back'. James Cameron as the director for this film really did a excellent job with the direction of the film and he gave the film real credit and make it feel real throughout. Also the cast did a excellent job. Linda as Sarah shows how much her character has change and we get to see her struggle with her past and inner pain and Linda's performance is far none. Arnold was born to play the Terminator he is the only person on Earth who could give justice to the role it is amazing how he could bring a Cyborg to the screen it just shows that Arnold was just the man for the job as The Terminator. Robert's performance as the T-1000 is both frighting and fantastic he just fit the role perfectly though he don't speak much his present alone is enough to make you fear him and I remember how scared I was of this character.It just goes to show with the right cast you got yourself a masterpieceNow I can't talk about the film without talking about the music which is one of my favorite scores of any movie every piece of music written for Terminator 2 just matches it story and feel. It just a terrific score plus the opening Theme for Terminator 2 sets the tone of what you will be seeing when the movie stars and even today I praise the opening song to Terminator 2. It just so many good things came out of Terminator 2 that it's hard not to call it one of your favorite films and one of the best sequels ever made because this film deliver. The Terminator said he would be back and he came back in a big way. Terminator 2 is a must have for any action film fan, Sci/fiction fan or any fan of movies in general because this my friends is a masterpiece.I give Terminator 2: Judgement Day a superb 10 out of 10.Hasta La Vista, Baby I'll be Back .",10,1,1,30 July 2015
Salt," Hard To Understand
","Salt is perhaps one of the few movies that I never could quiet understand.The plot changes so much that it really was hard to keep track it was like reading a book only that you have to go back a few pages to read get caught up.One minute this is going on the next it is just changing I mean I got so confuse it wasn't even funny.That's why I really couldn't enjoy watching this film, how many times can you change the script around before people can get where this is going?I mean one minute this character is good the next they're evil I mean good grief this is just one of those films that look better on paper and I don't care to watch this film ever again.The film Really should have been stop when it had the changeI give Salt a 3 out of 10",3,0,4,19 September 2015
Van Helsing," Now that I have your attention
","Van Helsing remains one of my personal favorite movies for the fact it had everything I want in a movie like this and then some. A movie that features Count Dracula, The Brides of Dracula, The Wolf-Man and Frankenstein's Monster all together now if that is not enough to see this movie than I don't know what is.I also like the cast with Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh and others. The main plot of the movie is centered around Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) along with his helper Carl (David Wenham) are send to Transylvania to help Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) to defeat Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) along with his brides Aleera (Elena Anaya), Verona (Silvia Colloca), Marishka (Josie Maran) as he seeks the Frankenstein's Monster (Shuler Hensley) with the help of Wolf- Man (Will Kemp).Having all that in one film is not something you find all the time so that's part of the reason I enjoy this movie and I also saw it in theaters opening night I set in the front row no less but I did see it in theaters.The opening pay tribute to the classic films as it was shown in Black and white like they did for movies in those days and it is a clever way to start off a wild run as the film begins to put you on edge. What makes this take of Van Helsing so cool is his weapons Hand-held Buzz Saws, Crossbow, Grappling Hook Gun, Two Revolvers, Short barreled pump action shotgun and each of his weapons are awesome in their own right and bring a lot to the character for combat against these monsters also Mr.Hyde (Voiced by Robbie Coltrane) makes a appearance as well as the first monster Van Helsing takes on in the film.The special effects for this film are well done and the transformation scenes of The Brides who can turn into vampire bats are very impressive as they used both the Actresses and C.G.I. to create the effects and it just well balance also the Wolf-Man transformation is very original instead of the old way of just growing hair to look like a wolf they took it to a new level. The action and stunt scenes are awesome as well as there is no limit but imagination from the cast and crew of this film who created stunt scenes that have never been try before in a film and they deserve a medal for the action scenes in the film and they are reason enough to watch this film if you haven't already.Hugh does a superb job as Van Helsing as you can tell he took the time to get into character, Kate is very good as Anna and you can sense the emotion from the character Richard take as the legendary vampire Dracula is both evil and chill factor as he brings a whole new level of darkness into Dracula plus when he transform into a bat you can tell this Dracula is dark and evil beyond belief, The three brides that were played by Elena, Silvia, and Josie each bring something different to the characters and let me tell you it's better if you watch the film to understand the character traitsAlso the film feature creative one liners like Van Helsing 'Now that I have your attention' so yeah the film does feature some clever writingThe plot of the film is what helps drives the film so if you watch this film with a open mind then you might enjoy it because the film is that good it just needs some more credit than it got because I enjoy this film ever seen I saw it in theaters so watch this movie you might be surprise how fun it because it's a wild thrill ride from the startI give Van Helsing an 10 out of 10",10,2,5,3 June 2015
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A movie Quentin Tarantino would be proud of
",When you watch Hansel & Gretel:Witch Hunters it's clear that Quentin Tarantino would have been pleased.But it is not in any way shape or form target for Children it is Rated R and it very graphic almost too graphic. To be honest I never wanted to watch this movie for the fact it took a children story and made it a R-Rated film about our protagonists become witch hunters.There are a few things I will say I like about the film. Gemma and Jeremy performances work well for the film they seem to have enjoy working together. Famke Janssen made for a horror style villain. Her performance is evilStunts in this film makes you go that's insane plus the weapons that Hansel and Gretel use are creative as well.It's just the level of gore in this film really hurts it I know some people enjoy them others have them limits. I would advice watch with caution because the gore and violence in this movie take it to the limit often times I had to turn away because I have my limits when it comes to thatMy advice only watch it if you're curious some might like it some will think one watch that's it.I give Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunter an 6 out of 10,6,1,1,15 October 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," Nothing Amazing
","So you think they would kept the story going after Spider-Man 3 well thanks to the bad reviews Sony and Marvel decided on a Reboot, Big Mistake.The Amazing Spider-Man retells how Peter Parker Becomes Spider-Man after the death of his Uncle.But it clearly was poorly cast with Andrew Garfield a no body as Spider-Man my only guess is that he bribed the casting director for the role because he was so awful that I wanted to turn off the movie from the get go.Emma Stone plays Gwen Stacy, the new love interest of Peter Parker I can't think of anything to say about her performance I mean her character was pretty boring.What really sets me off about this film is that while the Lizard is one of my favorite Spider-man villains they really wronged him in this film making him look like a Dinosaur wannabe with boring C G I effects.The acting in the film is forced to say the least nothing worth a single reward nor should it.Plus there are far too many gore scenes from this film and it was unneeded so that pretty much ruin the film for me.The writing is so bad that I should have turn off the film from the start because I could have wrote a story better than this.So this film was unneeded and was a awful idea to reboot the series all because of one film, Curse you Spider man 3 for forcing Sony and Marvel to reboot this series with a terrible actor.I wouldn't even recommend it for a rental.I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 1 out of 10.",1,4,18,1 February 2015

No Strings Attached," Clearly no strings were attach
",I rented this movie from Netflix mostly out of boredom and thought it would be something different And yes this film was so different that it has moments that were just too much information I know it's a romantic comedy but come on they could be thinking of other ideas when it comes to the plot and jokesIt just makes one wonder that because this film easily could rank up there as one of the most Bizarre movies ever made But the film did have some comedy bits that prove to be funny and I had to replay the scene again because it was that funnySurprising cast for this film it makes you wonder how they have gotten them to start in this comedy filmNow this film don't feature the best original story but they did try to make it interesting with the two protagonistsIt also do not have the best acting I ever seen but again most movies like this you wouldn't expect it to be reward winningOverall my best advice is that it's more of A movie to be rented than to own I give No String Attached 7 out of 10,7,0,2,1 January 2016
Inside Out," A original creative animation movie
","Tonight I took my niece to go see Inside Out because she asked me to and being the good uncle I took her.Turns out that the movie is actually pretty creative and has a original plot that is not too often these days. This is the 5th film I saw in theaters this year and turns out to be worth your while.I am not giving anything away because this is a movie you have to watch to better understand it because it does so much to be original and it does well for it.First let's talk about the cast Riley (Voiced Kaitlyn Dias) with the voices in her head: Joy (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (Voiced by Phyllis Smith), Fear (Voiced by Bill Hader), Anger (Voiced by Lewis Black), Disgust (Voiced by Mindy Kaling) along with her parents Mom (Diane Lane) Dad (Kyle MacLachlan) along with Bing Bong (Richard Kind). Pixar once again showcases their talents for bringing animation to life and it really shows it in this film. The movie is just amazing to look at and the emotion characters are very well design, you can see the real effects of the animation as it present itself on screenThe voice acting is really strong in this one as you can tell in the voice work that everyone wanted to bring the film to the dance Amy's performance is one of the best examples of brilliant voice acting and Kaitlyn's talented work as well is good. They all show real interest in making this movie when you listen to their voice work you can respect the energy of their performance'sInside Out has such a original story that only is best described to seeing the movie on the big screen because the story is clever and you will get good character development throughout the film with a lot of thinking that goes along with this movie.It really gets into your emotions, with a few tearful moments what comes out of this movieTrust me you should take the family to see Inside Out it is worth your timeWith great animation, impressive voice work and a character driven story there is nothing that holds PIXAR back it is one of their best works of animation that ranks out there with Toy Story, Cars among othersI give Inside Out an 8 out of 10",8,13,39,29 June 2015
Resident Evil," Resident Evil The horror Comes to the big screen
",Hard to believe this movie came out ten years ago.This is the first of the live action Resident Evil movies based off the video game of the same name.For the record the reason the movies are not based off the games fully is because Capcom requested the filmmakers not too because they were worry that the fans wouldn't buy the games but watch the movies.Being since games and movies cost just about the same amount of money to make them so I can understand Capcom's point of view.However now that we got that out of the way lets get started on this movie.The Story kind of feels like Resident Evil the game where a Mansion is the base of operation for the HIVE Umbrella's hidden lab where the T-Virus escape killing all the workers in the HIVE.Our main Character Alice played by Milla Jovovich who suffers from a effect that causes her to lose her memories.So when Alice meets Matt Addison played by Eric Mabius they are soon taking by a Special Forces team with Rain played by Michelle Rodriguez they are send in to find out what happen in the HIVE only for it to become a mission for survival against countless waves of Zombies and Monsters.Paul Anderson played the game before making the movie so at least he gave the game a try before making the movie and from what he said in interviews he fell in love with the games so he wanted to make a movie out of it.And to tell you the truth the movie really give me chills watching it because of the fact that the zombies and zombie dogs and Lickers the main villain in the movie looking so real that it really makes your heart race.So if you're a fan of horror movies or a fan of the Resident Evil Series I would recommend checking out this movie.Beware the movie is very graphic for some scenes so you got to have a strong stomach for it Nonetheless a good movie for fans and I recommend checking out I give Resident Evil a 8 out of 10,8,1,2,10 September 2012

In the theater the special effects just left everyone in awe the effects today even impress me because they took the time to actually create models and made it look real it goes to show that C.G.I. can have help with doing the real thing.The action scenes in this film are simply awesome they really go all out to make them tense and packed with amazing battles that you will be in awe when you watch it.Plus the music written for this movie is really top notch as each piece of music written for this film matches the story and each scene of the film Overall if you are a fan of action films you should check out this film it has everything you want, Still one of my favorite films I watched in the theater and still remain a great film I give Independence Day an 9 out of 10",9,0,0,4 July 2015

Then Eden, Lena, and Penny Chadwick (Played by Mika Boorem) were wondering what took her so long to get home.Annie Marie find out that Penny didn't finish her homework.They thought that Anne Marie And Matt Tollman were falling in love, but Anne was denying it.Then Lena said 'Don't Deny it, you were You were working it like a rib without the sauce'.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park returns
","After the success of Jurassic Park it was only a matter of time before we would get a sequel. From what I understand Michael Crichton had no plans for a sequel but Steven Spielberg convince him to write a sequel.What we got was The Lost World. I remember in 1997 how fired up I was to learn we were going to get a sequel to Jurassic Park and I saw it twice in theaters with my family ended up getting a good percent of the toys from the film.Looking back on it I'm surprised the film wasn't given the R Rating considering how this is the most graphic film in the Trilogy and some of the scenes were too much for a PG-13 film. Despite the mix reviews I find it to be a good film sure it's not perfect it does have thrills and action like in the first film and some that are just wow and the only way to give it justice is to watch the film.The film plot this time centers around Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is asked by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to lead a research team onto Isla Sorna Site B the team being his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) and Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) and Ian's daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) who got to study how the Dinosaurs are surviving on the island all the while try and stop Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) as he leads a team of hunters lead by Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite),Dieter Stark (Peter Stormare),Ajay Sidhu (Ajay Sidhu), Dr. Robert Burke (Thomas F. Duffy) Carter (Thomas Rosales Jr)Cameo Joseph Mazzello returns as Tim and Ariana Richards returns as Lex for the start of the film. Being that this film takes place four years after Jurassic Park this film had a lot to live up to. The reaction in the theaters back in 1997 was huge so it did something right to get movie fans to be in awe by the film. The film feature some of the most tense scenes ever in a movie with my personal favorite scene is when Ian, Nick and Sarah are hanging over the cliff in their trailers that scene will have your skin crawling and your nerves up high. And the effects for the dinosaurs are once again impressive as they used a mix of Puppet work and C.G.I. In this film you can feel that the Dinosaurs are meant for business each time they are screen you know something is about to happen. That what give the movie a edge when it comes to seeing how the characters react to the Dinosaurs in the film The music once again is amazing, John Williams music always tells a story and this film is no different each score he wrote for this film matches the story and plot each time you hear his music you can tell some love went into these score.The film also features good quotes like 'Predators don't hunt when they're not hungry' and 'Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long sad history of bad ideas'.The film is pretty dark as this often times feels like a horror film as the scenes can feel that way when you see the predators coming out of hiding you'll be able to understand where I'm coming fromFor the Dinosaurs we get Two Tyrannosaurus Rex one male one female as well as a young one, Compsognathus, Gallimimus,Mamenchisaurus Pachycephalosaurus,Edmontosaurus,Parasaurolophus,Pteranodon Stegosaurus,Triceratops and Velociraptor. Each Dinosaur is amazing to watch on the screen which is why I love the Jurassic Park films.You can tell the film makers love to make these movies While this film did get some mix reviews I found it to be a worthy sequel to Jurassic Park is it perfect? No but it does well with the plot the tense action scenes and stunts the acting is pretty good and the music is amazing to listen to. My advice is to watch the movie for yourself you'll be impress if you just sit back and enjoyI give The Lost World: Jurassic Park an 8 out of 10",8,12,16,10 June 2015
Cars," Cars: Animation Fun
","I remember going into the theater back in 2006 when one of my local theaters offer free popcorn for the summer of 2006. Being that I love both movies and popcorn and getting popcorn for free how could you refuse a offer like that?And it was a smart way to get people to come to theater and it is a very nice theater. Any way lets get to the reviewCars is a Disney/Pixar animation film that is quite different from their other animation films but still remains one of my favorite movies that I seen in the theatersThere is nothing too much to say that is bad about Cars, it appeals to all movie fans, those who like animation movies, car movies, movies with story there is something for everyone in this filmOne of my favorite things about Cars is the soundtrack which features songs like 'Real Gone' by Sheryl Crow, 'Life Is a Highway' by Rascal Flatts, 'Our Town' by James Taylor, 'Find Yourself' Brad Paisley. Normally I'm not big on country music but this film soundtrack is so good that you will want to buy the CD and each song is a theme to the movie.Plus the animation in this movie is phenomenal, The animators really took the time to detail every shot frame by frame. The smallest detail is not left unturned they also took seek help from real car experts and the result is perfect. Well done colors and effects just bring this movie to lifeThe Voice cast was really smart with Owen Wilson voice Lighting McQueen the films main protagonist, Bonnie Hunt as Sally Carrera, Paul Newman as Doc Hudson, Larry The Cable Guy as Matter the tow truck along with Michael Keaton who voiced the films main antagonist Chick Hicks. Along with other cast members being Cheeech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, Jenifer Lewis, The film also features racing legends Dale Earnhardt Jr, Richard Petty, Darrell Waltrip along with cameos from Jay Leno, Sheryl Crow Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, John Goodman among othersCars also features a story that is just one to watch to better appreciate.This is just one film that whole family can watch and just enjoy, it features heart, comedy, racing action and it just all around enjoyable for all members of the familyWith great voice acting, superb animation and being a fun movie all together how can you not enjoy this filmI give Cars an 9 out of 10",9,0,0,18 June 2015
Gone Girl," Mind twisting thriller
","'They say the mind bends and twist in order to deal with the horrors of life'. Now that being said I have to say when I sit down to watch Gone Girl it is without a shadow of a doubt Gone Girl is one of the most intense and twisted films I ever watched.Not only for the chilling and powerful story but also visual and the tone of the film matching the story of the book it just more than enough to hold your attention it just delivers on high emotions and present itself to be one of the best films in a long time.However there are a few scenes that can be too much for the viewers and make you turn away trust me you will turn away from the scenes that can be too graphic just given a fair warning it still has a lot going for it.Rosamund Pike's performance is just perfect in this movie she deliver one of the best performance of any leading actress she just brought this movie to attention. Ben Affleck also showcase given the right script he can act and he did very good in the film, Tyler Perry also did a good job in the film. Along with the other cast members who did their part to give this movie the credit it deserves. The writing in the film is just unbelievable that it play mind games with you from the start and more than enough plot twist that will just shock you it likes they hired someone who knows the mystery of the mind to give you a thriller that it's biggest strength is the power of the mind it's just amazing how clever they pull this film together.Seriously the best way to give this film justice is for you to give it a watch because it just one of those rare Thrillers brought some of the most clever and most intense story telling ever in any motion picture and it showcase that there is hope for motion pictures With powerful Story telling, amazing performances and visual that matches the tone of this film you will be in awe I Give Gone Girl an 8 out of 10",8,2,5,23 July 2015
Frozen," Quite the film
","Disney has made many films that have become classics like 'The Little Mermaid' And 'The Lion King' of course that was during the Disney Renaissance where they would make musical animation films with powerful story telling, Animation work that is top notch as well as Songs that have remain hits today like they were back then.Frozen has that feel that it could begin the second Disney Renaissance since it is one of the few films from Disney that has a story and musical feel to it.My nieces love this film and I have to say it is quite the movie it just has a lot going for it. The plot of the film is that Anna (Kristen Bell) must search for her older sister Queen Elsa (Idina Menzel) who has the power to create snow and ice and has accidentally turn the Kingdom into a frozen ice winter. Anna teams up with Mountain Man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) his trusted Reindeer Sven and a snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) to change what Elsa has done. Hans (Santino Fontana) Frozen story is quite strong and clever for a Disney film. What is the strong point of the film is the music which is wonderfully done. It helps move the film along as each piece of music written for the film match it just right. Of Course the film features original songs which are what make Frozen famous My top five favorite songs are 5: 'Do You Want To Build a Snowman' 4: 'Frozen Heart' 3: 'Love Is a Open Door'/ 'In Summer' 2: 'Let It Go' 1: 'For The First Time In Forever'. Each song for the film is well written and express emotion from the characters. Plus who knew Kristen Bell could sing I mean it really impress me to know she could sing like a bird sure we knew Idina Menzel could sing but wow Kristen really is impressive with her singing voice when you hear her in the film you'll be impress.As for the voice acting it is superb, with each cast member matching each character right and you can feel the emotion of the characters they can make you laugh, feel for them. They really brought these characters to life like Anna, Elsa and Olaf. The Animation is beautiful with great effects and backgrounds that really are quite amazing to look at, the characters are well design well animated it just feels like they took the time to match each animation to the Tee. You can look at the film and be impress with the artwork.Disney for the first time in forever brought an amazing film to the picture and the haters can let it go.The film is great for the whole family and it is hard to not be impress with the animation and music. This is a film you can't miss.I give Frozen an 9 out of 10. Frozen is a extreme work of art.",9,8,15,24 April 2015
Ghost Rider," Negative Ghost Rider
","Ghost Rider had what it took to be a epic motion picture based off one of the biggest Anti-Hero characters in comic book historyNow this movie look better on paper and it is without a doubt one of the most awful films I ever seen.This goes to show how not to make a comic book motion picture. Now I know there are those who like this movie I am not one of those few who enjoy this movie at allOther then the special effects which were pretty impressive to see Ghost Rider with his Motorcycle and the fire around them that is some good effects and Sam Elliot's performance which he pretty much makes the match watchable with his performance and his character is the most interesting one out of the entire castWhen you got one actor who pretty much stole the show that's bad.The rest of the movie is just a blur to watch because there is so much wrong that went into this movie. Plus the acting in the film is border line that's the best way I can decided it plus there is hardly anything of interest about this film It's just hard to give this movie any thing of worth because it has such bad casting, terrible looking characters and overall just a movie where the special effects are what makes the film worth watching that is pretty badI give Ghost Rider a 3 out of 10",3,0,0,18 November 2015
The Incredibles," An Incredible Film
","Pixar around the 2000s were doing a strong showing of their motion pictures and have created some of the finest Animation movies ever created. I recently pick up the film again after not seen it for years. And it still holds up as a impressive and strong original film from Disney and Pixar The Incredibles is a original movie where a family of Super Heroes trying to live a normal life.The story of the film is very creative and well written, well thought out and some of the best original lines for any film. Also the characters are really a joy to watch Bob Parr/Mr.Incredible (Voiced by Craig T.Nelson) his wife Helen Parr/Elastigirl (Voiced by Holly Hunter) their son Dashiell 'Dash' Parr (Voiced by Spencer Fox) and daughter Violet Parr (Voiced by Sarah Vowell) and infant son Jack Jack Bob's best friend Lucius Best Frozone (Voiced by Samuel L.Jackson) The film's main antagonist Syndrome (Voiced by Jason Lee)Each character bring their own special factor to the film and the voice acting is superb each actor and actress helps make their characters powerful. All the cast made the film very strong with their voice performances.Animation is very well done and brilliant every attention to detail is impressive all the character models along the superheros with their powers make the film impressive. The Incredibles just hit pay dirt from the moment it was introduce to movie goers goes to show that Pixar knew what they were doing and knew exactly the kind of film they wanted. A Super Hero film the whole family could enjoyIt mixes action and comedy perfectly you will find yourself replaying the comedy bits over and over because it does that good of a job to make you laugh. I found myself still chuckling after watching the movie.Goes to show after you see a film again you haven't seen for a long time it still remains fun With great animation, superb voice acting and being a creative motion picture you will be glad you watch this movieI give The Incredibles an 9 out of 10",9,1,2,16 August 2015
Driven," A very Driven movie
","Here is a good movie that shows what it like to race F1 formula cars.I really enjoy this movie for the action, along with the drama and the music.I'm a huge racing fan, mostly NASCAR.Anyways, Driven is a very good racing movie.I'm just a movie fan who just appreciate good movies, cause there ain't a lot of good movies out anymore.I thought the acting was really good with a great group of actors and actresses.I thought Verona Feldbusch was wonderful for the role of Nina, cause she is a strong and wonderful actress.One of my favorites, Burt Reynolds as Carl Henry.Sylvester Stallone was great as Joe Tanto.Kip Pardue was good as Jimmy Bly.Driven is just so well done and it shows how great the sport of Racing is.The music is one of the reasons I enjoy this movie cause it's just too good not to listening to the music.Driven is one of those movies that is great for racing fans and for people looking for something different.I give Driven 8 out of 10.Great movie.",8,1,2,14 July 2006
Cars 2," A Car Wreck
",Like many I was very impress with Cars it is one of the most clever animation films we had in a long time. That still remains one of my favorite films I saw in theaters.However Cars 2 does nothing to hold water to the first film as a matter of fact it should have never been created it is one of the most disappointing sequels in the history of sequels and it is not even worth being consider a direct to video release.I apologize that is a insult to direct to video releases because there are direct to video releases that would kick this one to the curve. They change the roles of Lighting McQueen and Mater making Mater the story protagonist and central character How could you think that would be a good idea? You can't just switch the protagonists and expect it to work. It can't.The plot for the film totally takes away what makes the first film a joy to watch. It just really destroy it. The animation is very well done and pretty much the only good thing I have say about this film. The voice acting rage from good to just stupid also some of the new characters look better on paper.I give Cars 2 an 5 out of 10 and this is being nice,5,1,2,8 September 2015
Coyote Ugly," Coyote Ugly is a true classic, great music, hot girls, great movie, great movie.

Back to the Future Part III," Great Scott What a excellent trilogy
",The Back To The Future Series remains one of my most favorites even today I love them they are like a fine wine only get better with age. There's something special about these movies that just makes you love them and they just really hold up as masterpieces.I remember watching this one a lot as a kid on VHS and there is so much to like about this movie.The plot for this film centers around Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travels back to 1885 to find Dr. Emmitt Brown (Christoper Lloyd) before Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson) finds him first we are also introduce to Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen).The fact the movie is set in the Old West makes it plenty of opportunely to use the setting and it does that pretty well.The Effects are pretty awesome plus I enjoy the comedy bits of the movie it goes to show how with creative writing you will have a win win for the fans. Also the movie is full of great movie quotes.The Acting in this movie is very strong with the Back To The Future films you can always count on good acting and this film is no different the cast once again brought their craft to the filmThis film does a great justice on wrapping up a great trilogy and it is one of the best third movies in a series ever. I give Back To The Future Part 3 an 10 out of 10,10,3,3,22 October 2015

Resident Evil: Apocalypse," My favorite of the Resident Evil Live Action Movies
","This is my favorite of the Resident Evil Live action movies, I seen the movie twice in the theaters, I own it on DVD,Blu-Ray and UMD PSP.I just felt this one in my opinion really show respect to the games because they did tones of things in the movie that came from games like Resident Evil 3 Nemesis and Code Veronica.Also we get to see the debuts of Jill Valentine (A Resident Evil Legend) and Carlos from Resident Evil 3.Milla Jovovich returns as Alice the main hero of the series with Jill Valentine being played by Sienna Guillory and I will say Sienna did well playing Jill she even look at her from Resident Evil 3 so I'll give her points for looking like the character Oded Fehr plays Carlos and he did well for the most part as Carlos they made Carlos different from his video game counterpart.The story takes places right after the first movie, The T-Virus has now escape into Raccoon City and has infected many and slowly turn them into Zombies.Major Tom Cain played by Thomas Kretschmann is order to lead a team to get all of Umbrella's top researchers out of the hot spot but one Dr.Ashford played by Jared Harris refuse to leave without his Daughter Angie Ashford played by Sophie Vavasseur. Angie was to be taken to him but her car crashed forcing her to take cover in her school.So Dr.Ashford contracts the Survivors, Alice, Jill, SJ (Mike Epps) and Carlos and makes them a deal, in return for a way out of the city they will rescues his daughter.Things get worst as Cain sends Nemesis after them from Resident Evil 3 played by Matthew G Taylor. Nemesis really was a force to be deal with. Nemesis was very dangerous in the video game because he could run dodge attacks and chase the player into different areas of the game. Nemesis in this movie is very much like his video game counterpart.So yeah I felt like they really did a lot of tributes to the games with this movie and in my opinion the story was very well done because of the way they mix action and horror in the movie.Being this is my favorite of the series I think it is the best out of the ones that were made and I'm glad to have it and have seen it in the theaters.I give Resident Evil:Apocalypse a 10 out of 10",10,9,13,11 September 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," We're The Guardians Of The Galaxy
","When I first heard Marvel newest movie Guardians Of The Galaxy I didn't give it much thought at the time. I have some rules when it comes to a movie. While it was getting very positive reviews But when I heard that Chris Pratt visit a children's hospital to present toys from the movie with a special screening of Guardians Of The Galaxy that's when I made up my mind.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Revenge is coming
","Kill Bill is one of the most clever films I have seen and the film is what you would expect from Quentin Tarantino.Kill Bill draws a lot of inspiration from classic western motion pictures and Japanese films as well, Quentin shows why he is considered one of the greatest directors ever and writers as well.And the film just shows how you are suppose to make a hit film in the new generation. Everything about this film is worth your time The plot of the film centers on The Bride (Played by Uma Thurman) as she awakes from a Four Year Coma thanks a team of assassins Lead by Bill (Played by David Carradine). She begins her quest for revenge for her unborn child and herself as she hunts down each one of the assassins who destroy her life. O-Ren Ishii (Played by Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Played by Vivica A.Fox) Elle Driver (Played by Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Played by Michael Madsen).The film shows how revenge is a dish best served cold and how the old saying is true that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned because the Bride is armed with a samurai sword that she gain from Hattori Hanzo (Played by Shin'ichi Chiba)The film just does a super job with telling a great story with top notch taunts and awesome action scenes. Quentin Tarantino is one of those directors he could touch stones and make them gold. And that's exactly what Kill Bill is, a Golden Masterpiece for Martial Arts Motion Pictures.The acting is very well done as the cast perform to the best of their talents with Quentin Tarantino giving them great direction on how to bring their characters to life.The music is what you should have in any movie as each music piece helps tell the story of Kill Bill and original songs for the film like 'Battle Without Honor Or Humanity' is the clear theme of the film.Everything is just very well done in Kill Bill the settings are very good and the fight scenes are well thought out and well time.If you want a classic film that has superb action stunts and well match story then Kill Bill Vol.1 is for you.I give Kill Bill Vol.1 an 8 out of 10",8,0,2,29 April 2015
Clash of the Titans," Release The Kraken
","During my trip to Talladega for the NASCAR races in 2010 with my dad and a family friend we didn't want to sit in the hotel room all day so we thought why not go to the movies and that's what we did.However there weren't much of option of the movies we could see in theaters so we agree on the 3D release for Clash Of The Titans.Now this was my first 3D movie I saw in theaters and it anger me because the 3D effect didn't even happen in the movie only in the previews looking back it should have been a red flag on the film how it would turn out.Now casting wise Sam Worthington played Perseus Gemma Arterton played lo, Mads Mikkelsen as Draco, Liam Cunningham as Solon, Hans Matheson as Ixas, Nicholas Hoult as Eusebios I liked Liam Neeson as Zeus, Ralph Fiennes as Hades, Danny Huston as Poseidon, Alexander Siddig as Hermes, Luke Evans as Apollo,Nina Young as HeraWith the 3D effects which really wasn't in the film all that often it really hurt the enjoyment of watching this movie. I recently pick it up for DVD just for the sake of collecting all the films I have seen in theatersClash Of The Titans I know is a remake and I have yet to seen the original movie.What I did like about the film was there was some good effects and action scenes that help make the movie interesting enough to watch. Plus the music in the film is good as well and a few scenes with acting But the movie is pretty much a disappointment, some of the writing feels out of slight out of mind and the 3D effects are pretty much none-existed so it was watching a movie with both eyes closes as well as it was a drain on my eyes to have to rub my eyes through out the movie also there were some scenes that could have been left out of the film but I'll let you see for yourself. While there could be some interest for those who are fans of the original or someone looking for a movie to watch. I might have enjoy this movie if it didn't feel like it was rushI give Clash Of The Titans an 6 out of 10",6,0,0,22 June 2015
Jurassic World," Welcome To Jurassic World
","At last! It felt like it would never come but like the old saying 'Never say never'. I grew up with Jurassic Park and Dinosaurs were a huge part of my life.And after hearing the news in late 2014 that my wish was finally coming true it is just thrill me that after Fourteen years Jurassic was returning. Under the new title Jurassic World but watching the film you will understand why it is called Jurassic World. What makes the movie even better was seeing it with family, I saw Jurassic World early this morning in theaters with my older brother my two younger nieces and my dad it's always better to go to the movies with those you enjoy seeing movies with and it was worth the ticket to go see Jurassic World in a jammed packed theater. I'm not kidding it was full to the max only a few seat were able to get to. It is also one of the best movie thrill rides you have seen in a long time. Now I want to make something understandable I want everyone to go see this movie and it will be as spoiler free as possible for this review It was the vision that John Hammond wanted for Jurassic Park and it became a real theme park on the island where it all begin 20 years before on Isla Nublar. We are also given a new cast of characters and actors. We have Owen Grady played by Chris Pratt who has become one of my favorite actors lately and he was very good in this film as the main protagonist when I learn he was cast in the role I felt we were in good hands with him as the leading actor you could tell he enjoy every bit of the movie and he got to use some clever punch lines. Claire Dearing played by Bryce Dallas Howard who does a good job in this film as she plays the Park's Operations manager and she gets the VIP passes to her nephews Zach and Gray Mitchell played by Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins. They are given a interesting story as their parents Karen and Scott played by Judy Greer and Andy Buckley are the ones who send them to Jurassic World to visit their aunt. Also Vi Hoskins played by Vincent D'Onofrio Head of Security operations for InGen right from the start you can tell this guy was going to be trouble, Barry played by Omar Sky who helps Owen with the rapports, Lowery Cruthers played by Jake Johnson and Vivian played by Lauren Lapkus are also new to the movie the only actor from the films to return is B.D.Wong who reprise his role as Dr.Henry Wu and he serves a lot more to the plot as you will discover.Also a lot of the old favorite Dinosaurs are back, we get Stegosauurs, Apatosaurus, Ankylosaurus,Pterandon, Triceratops,Velociraptors, and Tyrannosaurus Rex we are also introduce to Monsasauraus and the movie main Dinosaur Antagonist Indominus Rex and this is the hybrid dinosaur the only way to give this animal justice is to go watch it on the big screen she is a real predator. Jurassic World also gives you that nostalgia feel because the music the look of the dinosaurs and the fact it takes place on the same island it just awesome rush plus listening to the music of the film as it plays the themes we know and love about Jurassic Park It made me smile listening to the songs.Also they used animatronics for the dinosaurs because that is how the series started with and it is a respective tribute to the filmsThe cast gave us a very good performance as you watch the film you can tell they each love Jurassic Park and wanted to honor what had made it so great. I along with everyone in the theater appreciate what the cast did for those of us who love the series.Just watching the Dinosaurs on the big screen again was super awesome and they were so cool to see come back to life on the screen they did a good job as they always do with the performance of each DinosaurJurassic World in my opinion really deliver and hit this one way out of the park after waiting for so long it was excellent to see Jurassic World on the big screen One of the few movies I can remember where everyone in the theater gave a movie a round of applause. If you love Dinosaurs and Jurassic Park then you must go see Jurassic World and spare no expenseWith a good cast, tense action and the return of the Dinosaurs you will have to see it twice to take it all inI give Jurassic World an 10 out of 10!",10,41,99,14 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers Age Of Ultron, Avengers Return
","Today I took my niece to see Avengers: Age of Ultron the movie we waited for and had talk about for weeks and weeks and today on opening day we saw and it is one of the best films I have seen ever on the big screen. It was made special because I was with my niece.And I am going to keep this spoiler free because this is a film where you have to see it twice to take it all in. Avengers Age of Ultron gives you everything you would want in a Marvel movie and then some.The plot this time centers around the Avengers Iron-Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner AKA Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are now up against a new threat a new villain named Ultron (Played by James Spader) along with having to deal with Scarlet Witch (Played by Elizabeth Olsen) and her twin brother Quicksilver (Played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson).The film is pack with characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Cobie Smulders, Hayley Atwell, Stellan Skarsgard, Idris Elba, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Samuel L Jackson and many others reprise their roles for the film and of course cameo with Stan Lee. Now this film has a lot to live up to considering it's following in the footsteps of the other Marvel Movies that have begin with The Avengers but lucky in my opinion the sequel shows how you can make it a strong champion in the Marvel Universe.The film balance out as you are getting many characters from Marvel into one. Plus the film brought a lot to the table this time.And I found the humor in this film to be superb as everyone in the theater laugh that it almost got a round of applause, I mean they really did a good job with making you laugh.When the action scenes happen you are on the edge of your seat, they brought their A-Game for the film with the wild stunts and superb action scenes.The cast of the film does a grand job with their performance James' take of Ultron really surprised me as well as Elizabeth who I enjoy as Scarlet Witch, of course the original cast did their part and help tell the story of the film where you can feel their emotions from their characters that we know and love.The Effects for this movie are really good and will take your breath away. Music, I know I always talk about the music in motion pictures but to me if you have the music you got the film since music is as much apart of the movie as the cast and crew are, lucky the music in the film is top notch as you would expect nothing less from Avengers.There is just so much going for this film that you would be a fool to miss this one everything about this sequel makes it a strong consider for the box office and to become one of the biggest movies of the year. With story telling, superb special effects, strong acting, humor and intense action scenes you will not be disappointed. There are no strings on meI give Avengers: Age Of Ultron an 9 out of 10And for Gosh's Sake Watch Your Language",9,1,7,1 May 2015
Taken," One line says it all
","Taken: A original emotional driven story that matches this action film..The plot centers around Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) a retired CIA agent travels across Europe and relies on his old skills to save his estranged daughter,Kim (Maggie Grace) who has been kidnapped while on a trip to Paris.What also makes the film well known is for Bryan's quote 'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you'. That is quite a powerful threat to make in the movie and it goes to show how far a father would go for his daughter. Liam brings a level of pain to the action genre as his character proves to be a smart and deadly fighter. The film not only feature intense moments of action but the emotional driven experiences is what drive the movie in this action/thriller. The writers were doing something right for doing a action film that features a story where the emotions run high and have your nerves on highSo this is a film you must watch because it is that goodI give Taken an 9 out of 10",9,0,0,21 September 2015
The Mummy Returns," So much that could have been
","If it wasn't for the fact Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was going to be in this movie I might not have bother with it.Mostly for the fact I never seen the first one and I sadly have a bad habit of seeing a sequel before seeing the last film. But after watching this film I don't think I'll see the first one.I mean the one thing I did enjoy about the film was the fight scenes which were good enough to watch the film.Also the setting wasn't that bad at all and some effects work well for the plot.But other than the film just left with so much that could have been. Plus it's never a good idea to promote your movie around one star just to get butts to seats and sell tickets that is never a good idea. Also the movie is graphic even for the rating it got, normally I try to avoid seeing that much in a film plus the acting in the film just feels out of wax I can't recall one good performance from anyone while it does have good actors I just don't think the acting is worth well nor is the plot of the film. It just one of those films you'll enjoy or you won't and I didn't enjoy this one at all so much that could have been only to be disappointingI give The Mummy Returns a 5 out of 10",5,1,2,18 October 2015
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," For fans only
",Now the reason I make that statement is because you have to be a fan of Harry Potter to have enjoy this movie or you have to be a fan of wizard movies to better enjoy.I remember seeing this movie in theaters with family members that I didn't hang out with much and I remember how cold it was outside in the theater but when we went inside the movie theater room to watch the film it was really hot. So much so that I wanted the movie to be done as soon as possible because I remember being miserable in the hot room.Now onto the movie I never read any of the Harry Potter books nor have I even heard of this movie until I saw it in theaters. So the film does have a good cast of actors and they did perform very well in the movie. The plot from what I can tell follows the events of the book and the characters seem to have follow the same way as they are in the bookThere are some cool effects in the film that make you go wow but a few that only fans would understandMusic in the film matches the movie and it works to help telling the story. It just the film to me was a bit confusing and didn't make a fan out of me. It just some of the scenes in the movie leave me scratching my head so this film would only be more for the fans of Harry Porter while it does something for someone who enjoy this series of movies it just one of those love/hate ordeals I give Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone an 7 out of 10,7,0,2,29 June 2015
Thor," Thor The God Of Thunder has Arrived
","I pick up Thor on DVD right after The Avengers and Thor The Dark World were release, I felt I should follow the story of the films since they all tie into each other and it helps understand the Avengers more at least with how Thor and Loki play into the film.Thor (Played by Chris Hemsworth) along with his brother Loki (Played by Tom Hiddleston) Thor's childhood friend Lady Sif (Played by Jaimie Alexander) warriors of Asgard. After a battle that starts a war between the Frost Giants and their King, Laufey (Played by Colm Feore)Odin(Played by Anthony Hopkins) Thor's father vanishes his son from Asgard and send to Earth. his wife and mother of Thor Frigga (Played by Rene Russo) also forbids his return.On Earth, Thor befriends Dr.Jane Foster (Played by Natalie Portman) Darcy Lewis (Played by Kat Dennings) and Dr.Erik Selvig ( Played by Stellan Skarsgard) as he tries to make use of his surroundings on Earth. After watching the film I have to say I very much enjoy it because it was different from other Marvel based films and I didn't have huge highs going into the film.I do know some history to Thor and own one comic book in my collection, but I did research Marvel's Thor before getting the movie so it helps to understand the character.The cast was a wise mix of actors to play the roles Chris Hemsworth became a star after Thor, Tom Hiddleston was great as Loki you could tell he had fun playing the brother of Thor of course Anthony Hopkins was a wise choice to play Odin he fit into the role perfectly so well done.The action in the film was very well thought along with the music fit each scene in the film.Thor is just one of those films you can enjoy for the story and performance of the cast.So if you're a fan of Thor and Marvel you will enjoy this movie.I give Thor an 8 out of 10",8,0,1,3 February 2015
Zombieland," Zombleland? More like boredom land
",To say I hate this movie would be a huge understatement. This film clearly insults your intelligence and that is what it felt like to me when I watch this film.Without a doubt one of those stupidest movies I have ever seen it is very bad comedy and not even close to being funny and it is gross to bootThe characters in this film are simply too stupid for you to even consider knowing and the cast really was ridiculous awful and had I known who they cast in this film I wouldn't have watch it.Zombleland is one of the films I regret ever laying eyes on and even watching for that matter trust me you will be doing your intelligence a great justice by never ever watching this film.I mean as soon as I watch it it clearly insulted my intelligence yes I have seen some bad movies but this one is so awful that I will watching other bad movies before seeing this joke again.Trust me stay away from Zombleland it has a cast that play stupid characters and so much so that i hope they don't do a sequel or a TV seriesI give Zombleland a 1 out of 10 I wish there was a way to rate movies a zero because this film deserve one,1,1,8,23 May 2015
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Mr.& Mrs.Smith: Action, Comedy, and one movie that makes you go wow
","Mr.& Mrs.Smith goes to show that some marriages can be more than what one bargain for. And that's exactly what happens when Jane Smith (Angelina Jolie) and John Smith (Brad Pitt) a bored married couple soon discovers that both are assassins. However they are hired to kill each other which leads up to a wild and crazy ride. I remember in 2005 when I first watched this movie I made a blog that said 'I have heard of marriage problems but this is ridiculous'. And that is again exactly the best way I could put Mr.& Mr.Smith. However what the film does offer is pretty rewarding but with some drawbacks.The film feature a creative plot, Angelina and Brad worked very well together and were the right choices for the two main characters. Who would have guess that they could have work like gold in the film.The humor in this film just has you rolling such as the car scene where Jade and John begin to have a fight in the car as it goes over and John said 'We need to talk'. The insults they give each other also will make you laugh.The action and fight scenes are the shining light of the film I really enjoy the fight scene John and Jade had in their house that was very well done and clever. Just that scene alone makes the film worth your while. But there is some disappointment that can be expected but I can't really explain it that would work. The real honest way to do so is to watch the film for yourselfMr.& Mrs. Smith is one of those films that the only way to enjoy it is to watch it yourself. It does have a strong collection of humor and you can't go wrong.I give Mr. & Mrs. Smith an 8 out of 10",8,1,4,17 August 2015
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transformers Has Return for another round
","Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen takes place two years after the events of the first Transformers Movie.The Autobots: Optimus Prime, Ironhide, Bumblebee, Ratchet,Sideswipe,The Twins Mudflap and Skids, along with Acree and Jolt have form a new team with the Humans a top secret team known as N.E.S.T.

The Decepticons: Megatron, The Fallen, Starscream, Grinder, Sideways, Contructicons,Ravage and Soundwave are after Sam who has now started to go to college but when he discovers the piece of the Allspark on his clothes he begins seeing symbols of The Transformers' Past.Now I thought the story was very creative just has some holes in the movie however. Peter Cullen again returns to voice Optimus Prime and the return of Frank Welker who reprise his role as Soundwave was a big hit to me.Hugo Weaving also reprise his role as Megatron. Tony Todd did a scary job as The Fallen.The effects that went into the movie is a home run the Transformers look as awesome as they did the first movie.The Score is a mix of the new and old from the first Movie still not bad at all. Revenge Of The Fallen has a lot of plot twist. Along with surprise moments that you never see coming in the movie.A lot of comedy went into this movie in this round of the movies some of the funniest moments in ever in a movie.The Movie does has it fair share of strike outs however I enjoy this movie a lot because I grew up a Huge Transformers fan and I still glad to be a fanSo overall there are mix feelings about Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen but I still enjoy the movie a lot and there are some things I would like to have changedOverall I give Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen a 9 out of 10Thank you for reading my review and take care.Optimus Prime: Autobots Transform And Roll Out!Decepticons: DECEPTICONS ATTACK!",9,10,17,24 June 2010
Wedding Crashers," Wedding Crashers a Classic
",I saw Wedding Crashers twice at the box office back in the summer of 2005 and I am glad I went to see it because I laugh so much that it was so good.Wedding Crashers tells the story of two lawyers John Beckwith played by Owen Wilson and Jeremy Grey played by Vince Vaughn who crash wedding to sleep with single women at the weddings they go to.They do it as a sport to them it just their own sport.However when they get their chance to crash the biggest wedding of their career they soon find their true love the women they would do anything to be with Gloria played by Isla Fisher and Claire by Rachel McAdams.But they are the children of Secretary William Cleary played by Christopher Walken.But still in the movie they learn that this will not be a walk in the park for them.The Story is just so good that makes the movie even that much better.The humor is just perfect that you will just be laughing until your sides hurt in the whole movieThis is why I love movies and this is one of the best comedy movies ever made.I give Wedding Crashers a perfect 10 out of 10 I love this movie,10,1,2,15 July 2010
Kong: Skull Island," King Kong Extreme
",I admit it I saw Kong: Skull Island mostly out of curiosity and I never got to see a movie with Kong in theaters.This one however almost could have been Rated R because it features some graphic scenes that reminds me of 'The Lost World Jurassic Park'. Granted I know this movie isn't full with Dinosaurs but with a giant gorilla named King Kong along with other monsters on the island that they called home.If anything this movie proves that it was lucky to have gain an PG-13 rating for it graphic scenes and gore. Some of the scenes will make you turn you away. But despite this the movie does have some appeal to make you watch it.The fight scenes are intense and insane they will leave you in amazed and the special effects are pretty impressive making a fine example of C.G.I. monsters making you forget they are C.G.I. that's rare in movies these days.The acting in the movie the cast did the best they could some of the characters could have been better but again they did their best and some of the writing could have been better but there are moments of good writing and the drama of the characters make them important to the story and why they are who they are.The music in the movie is very good it helps tell the story of the movie.Normally I'm not crazy about Reboots or remakes however this one did the best they could and if you can look pass the flaws and gore you might be impress.I give Kong: Skull Islan an 8 out of 10,8,1,2,11 July 2017

Back to the Future Part II," Roads? Where we're going we don't need roads in this strong sequel
","Today is October 21,2015 which is exactly the same date that the film Back To The Future Part 2 take places in. Sequels always have a lot to live up to the original and lucky Back To The Future Part 2 does really strong and it holds up to the first Back To The Future Film and it is one of the best sequels ever created.The story does a real great justice to the first film. The film picks up exactly after the first film. Where this time Marty and Doc must prevent a event that takes place in the future and then the plot begins to change around that you have to watch to believe.Christopher Lloyd and Michael J.Fox both reprise their respected roles as Dr.Emmett Brown and Marty McFly along with Thomas F.Wilson who returns as the main antagonist Biff Tannen along with playing a new character named Griff. Elisabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Marty's Girlfriend Jennifer. There is a lot of references to the first film which is a plus for those who love the first film.

Taken 2," A sequel we didn't need
",Taken the first movie is one of my favorite films it really was original and shows that anything can happen with the right talent of both cast and crewTaken 2 however is pretty much a example of that a movie like Taken don't need a sequel. The film is more or less the same plot as the first movie only this time the roles are reverts where Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and Lenore (Famke Janssen) were taken hostage leaving their daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) to fend for herself. The writers did improve on the character for Kim. There are some worth while moments the action is still good. It just the plot is being like a copy cat to the first film. There are some good moments in the film and some clever intent moments that make you go wow it's just the film don't live up to the standards that the first film had set and it goes to show that Taken was better off without the sequel. It's just the film is more or less a disappointment while yes there are some moments that make it watchable but the film just will make you wish you were watching Taken 1 insteadI give Taken 2 an 6 out of 10,6,0,0,22 September 2015
Straight Outta Compton," Straight Outta Compton on to the big screen
","No Spoilers because I grew up around the same time that Rap Music was growing and this is a story that no many would know about so I'm keeping it spoiler free for those who don't know the history of the group N.W.A.I knew about Dr.Dre and Ice Cube from their solo careers and their other work as well. It wasn't until 'Behind The Music' that I discover both were in a group called N.W.A. But over the years I gain knowledge about the Group and listen to their songs it makes you go wow this group really had something.Straight Outta Compton is a Biography/Drama film that tells the story of how N.W.A. emerges from the streets of Compton in Los Angeles with their music and tales that explain the life in the hood. I went into this movie knowing some history but what I got here was I never saw coming The movie theater wasn't full but it had a good crowdThe five men would be Ice Cube, Dr.Dre, Eazy-E, MC Ren and Dj Yella. The film present itself very well and it is crafted to match the tone of the story where we learn about the history of N.W.A. The performances in this film are actually so well done that you can feel the emotion. It really hit home in some scenes plus with some impressive performance it is easy to forget that you were watching a movie.The music in the film has a collection of the classic Hip Hop songs from the mid 80s and 90s. It really good how they gave other classic songs some play time in the movieMy main complain about the movie is the slow down that take place. It was like they stall the film for a while perhaps it's me but that's how I felt. But if you enjoy movies about music than this should be consider seeing.While the film does lack in some areas it does make up for being truth to the style of N.W.A.With strong acting, raw music and good history on the group that made Hip Hop like it is you will be quite surprised I give Straight Outta Compton an 8 out of 10",8,7,41,18 August 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises
","When Christopher Nolan and Warner Bros rebooted Batman in 2005 it went on to make two sequels this one I saw in theaters as well the first Batman movie I have seen in theaters.Now the time has come for me to review the final film of the Nolan Dark Knight Series. The Dark Knight Rises.Now this movie had a lot to live up to after the success of The Dark Knight 2008. As I was in sitting in the theater watching The Dark Knight Rises I try to watch it with a open mind and not to keep my hopes up high on the fact this film was release four years after The Dark Knight. So you can see it was pretty hard not to see how this film would live up to that sequel.But in my opinion I found it to be a good film it just had some issues to me but I will not give away any of the film's plot you will have to watch it for yourself because it's one of those films that you have to watch from the start to understand the plot otherwise you'll be lost in the woodsThe Dark Knight Rises features returning cast members Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Fox.With our new cast members we get Anne Hathaway who plays Selina/Catwoman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Blake, Marion Cotillard as Miranda. The Dark Knight Rises main antagonist is Bane played by Tom Hardy. The film does a very well done job with character development as each character is explain with detail and interest to make you wonder what make them important to the plot as the story goes on. And you can tell by the writing staff they took their time and did their homework.The cast did a very good job with their performances and they brought attention to their characters plus with the writing staff they also had moments that make you feel for the characters so points for that oneAlso the film has some creative lines that never has been feature in a movie The music is one of the best examples of music/story telling we have seen in quite some time. Hans Zimmer created a remarkable score for the movie, each piece of music he wrote for the film is powerful. That's what another appeal to this Batman Series is the music and it just very well done.Action and stunts in the film are very good as well and well played out. They made the fights feel original It just most might find this film disappointing because they had their hopes up on it being as strong as the Dark Knight but what we should all remember is that The Dark Knight was successful for many reasons The Dark Knight Rises is a good film it just had some let downs but never judge a book by it cover.With Great acting, well balance writing, good fight scenes and amazing music The Dark Knight Rises deserves some love I give The Dark Knight Rises an 7 out of 10",7,0,2,16 June 2015

This leads Obadiah Stane (Played by Jeff Bridges) to begin questioning his mind.With help from Pepper Potts (Played by Gwyneth Paltrow) his assistant to help keep his affairs in order at Stark Industries along with his best friend Rhodey (Played by Terrence Howard).The plot of the film is one of the strong holds to Iron Man as it explain how Tony Stalk would become Iron Man and any fan of Iron Man would appreciate itWhile I wasn't sure much about Robert Downey Jr but after watching Iron Man it was clear he was born to play this role his performance in this film shows you can pull yourself out of a jam and become better and this film show case his talents as a actor because he brought Tony Stark to life on the big screen.Jeff Bridges went so far as to shaving his head bald like Obadiah in the comic books because he wanted to make sure he made the fans happy by looking like the character from the comics which is true to honoring the craft of acting.Gwyneth did pretty well as Pepper as in terms of her services to the role. The acting in the film is pretty strong as you see the cast pulling out the best of their talents to the film and there is a good bit of humor in the film.Action for this film is some of the best ever done in a film and some of the most creative as well you have to see the film to appreciate it Music wise is pretty awesome as it include Black Sabbath 'Iron Man' along with other original music to tell the story of each scene.The Special effects in the film are top notch the suits for Iron Man are very well design and detail as it shows the power of how C G I can be done for any film.Iron Man does a very well done film with story telling, acting and amazing special effects if you want to appreciate a good comic book movie watch Iron ManI give Iron Man an 9 out of 10",9,3,5,4 April 2015

","This is one of those rare Disney films that isn't a musical but manage to hold up on it's own against other movies from Disney.The Emperor's New Groove is a comedy animation movie that tells the story of Emperor Kuzco (Voiced by David Spade) after he is turned into a llama by Yzma (Voiced by Eartha Kitt) with her henchman Kronk (Voiced by Patrick Warburton) must seek help from Pacha (Voiced by John Goodman). What makes the film different from other films of Disney is the fact the film breaks the fourth wall now that is not something you have seen too many times in their films but for the plot it actually works and makes it more funny to. The animation in this film is very well done and the hand drawn animation is very impressive as they timed each scene just right and the character designs are very good in this film as well as superb backgrounds. Also the humor really works for this film and some of the most creative lines ever written came into this movie; The music in the movie set the tone for the film which helps deserve it very well. The voice acting is excellent, Surprising that David hasn't done many animation films because he did a very good job in this film, John Goodman does a excellent job in this film and help makes his character believable. Eartha's performance was just right for Yzma the main antagonist of the film she really deliver here. Patrick was pretty good as Kronk and he made the character very likable and funny throughout the film. It's a smart choice that they didn't make this into a musical style because it might not had work but nevertheless the film does well on it own. The film has some of the most entertaining scenes ever and will make you laugh. Also the film focus more character development and the relationship with the characters you actually can appreciate them and they make the film work very well. With very good animation, a clever story, and very well done voice acting you can't go wrong. I give The Emperor's New Groove an 8 out of 10",8,0,1,2 August 2015
Speed," Prepare for Speed
",1994 had a good collection of movies and Speed is one of those films it made stars out of Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.The film just shows how you can make a tense action film a strong plot and very strong performances. Plus it's good to see a film that is not so much desire or need of special effects since this film was done with using the real thing it goes to show this movie has some courage and still holds up to today even more showing to be one of the best movies of the 1990s.

Thor: The Dark World," Thor The Dark World Pure Entertainment
","It took me a while but I finally got to sit down long enough to watch Thor The Dark World which is a sequel to Thor (2011) and The Avengers where Thor also appears.And this time Thor will face his greatest challenge ever. Thor The Dark World takes a new twist as well as following the story line that took place in the Avengers.The film really took the effects to the extreme and the special effects are like watching the comic book come to life on screen really well time and show amazing talent. Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman, Jaimie Alexander, Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard all reprise their roles from the first movie and that's always good to see when you have the same cast return.But the plot for the film when you watch the film you understand why it was called The Dark World. It's good to see them mix humor with the story and they were clever with how to make the comedy, the drama is strong as well as each of the cast brings their best to the screen and of course the action is very well done as you see some of the most extreme fights in film What makes the film work is we get characters development that follows from The Avengers.The music in the film is superb with it helping telling the story of each scene for the film the action in the film is awesome and very well done plus you see how tough these characters are on their own.Again the Special effects are some of the most stunning I have seen in a film, the performance from the cast is a mix but they still deliver on the characters they bring to life and Marvel Fans will appreciate them for doing it.Thor The Dark World is a film that you have to watch it might not be highs of highs but it is still pure entertainment.

Lucy," What could have been
","Like many of us who watch the Trailer for the motion picture 'Lucy' we were fired up to say the least.With Scarlett Johansson as the lead character you would expect to see a strong female protagonist and being co-star with Morgan Freeman what could go wrong? Well I'm about to explain.The plot of the film centers around a normal everyday young woman named Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) who is forced into a dark deal, however she is transformed into a powerful warrior with knowledge beyond the human mind. Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) is teaching a college class when the two meet and begin to explore Lucy's new powers. Now what the trailer shows doesn't show you exactly what you would get when it comes to Lucy. It feels like the trailer was used to set a trap for you to think you would get to see a epic action film but what you get is not that at all.Now there is some action in the film and we get to see how dangerous Lucy is not only that she gain powers that make her body stronger but also her mind is show to be the most dangerous weapon.But that's where we begin to have our problems with the film, they try to do too much at once between having scenes we see Lucy and how she gets into this mess to seeing Mr.Norman giving a lecture in a college class about the human mind then we pretty much get a film that had a lot more of a film that try to be I couldn't find the word to match it. Lucy shows that she is one of the most interesting characters in film history it just the idea of mixing a action film like this with a lecture pretty much is mind blowing on how they thought they could get away. The film does feature some amazing special effects and how Lucy's powers are unreal makes you want to watch the film and just watching the film will make you see why Lucy is not the one you want to mess with. But I did enjoy Scarlett and Morgan performances they did a good job with their talents on the film it just the film would have be much better if it was just like the trailer said it would have been.I give Lucy an 7 out of 10",7,4,7,28 April 2015

300," This is Sparta
","300 I know is one of the biggest and most loved movies of 2007 and with good reason.I figure I had to review this movie sooner or later so I figure might as well get it out of my system.However I do feel mix about this movie not that it is a bad movie fair from it. Here's why I feel different about 300.But first the pros:I appreciate the dialogue that was written almost every quote in 300 is a masterpiece of it right. That's rare in motion pictures so I really enjoy the writing for this movie.The acting is superb Gerard Butler gave one of his best performances as King Leonidas, Lena Headey did a beautiful job as Queen Gorgo, Rodrigo Santoro gave a scary and powerful performance as Xerxes, David Wenham as Dilios serve a important figure in this film.The score is excellent it is one of the best written music for a movie every piece of music in this film is epic and helps tells the story of the movie.The Cons: The film just gets too graphic I understand the time period was that violet but it still can be too much. Also the film stalls at times which can hurt the movie and it did for me.300 is not a bad movie far from it I just don't feel it to be a superb masterpiece as many consider it but never the less if you enjoy movies like this it's right for you.I give 300 an 7 out of 10",7,0,2,23 October 2015
Fast Five," Back together for round Five
","Now when a long running series like The Fast And The Furious get sequels it is always a challenge to go out and try impress movie goers.However the series always tops itself with the recent sequels and Fast Five proof that's anything is possible with the right minds.The plot this time take place after Fast and Furious 4 left all with Brian O'Conner played by Paul Walker, Dominic Teretto Played by Vin Diesel, Mia Toretto played by Jordana Brewster head for Brazil to escape the law after a job with Vince Played by Matt Schulze went wrong. Which leads to them being hunted by Luke Hobbs Played by Dwayne Johnson who along with Elena Played by Elsa Pataky begin to hunt them down. Also returning are Roman Played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej Played by Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Han Played by Sung Kang, Gisele played by Gal Gadot. Reyes Played by Joaquim de Almeida who serves as the Film Main Antagonist.Story wise the plot is very good because it features the return of many of the characters from the series which is very good and moves the series along. Plus the film requires you to pay attention or you'll miss something. Plus you see the characters grow in this film from the last films.What drives the film like the other films is that the stunts from start to finish that defines The Laws of Physic and why I love this series because the cast and crew are always driven to push the limits and hold nothing back, Fast Five is the example of it.There is just a lot for this film that I recommend seeing for yourself where you'll be amazed and how you can do a sequel with the right minds.With awesome stunts, great action and plot you'll be glad you watch this film.I give Fast Five an 8 out of 10",8,19,22,3 April 2015

Annihilation," The first movie I ever I mean ever walked out of the theater on.
","After 'Transformers: The Last Knight' I learn a very valuable lesson and that is if the movie is going to keep getting worse just walk up and leave and that's exactly what I did for AnnihilationI went to see Annihilation in theaters and it now ties with Transformers The Last Knight as the worst movie I ever saw in theaters I walked out on it 30 minutes into the movie and I am using the word Movie loosely.I mean once again you try to take a gamble on something you think will make a lot of money but I got my money back on this movie because honestly this is one of those movies that should have said 'A money back guaranteed'.The acting in this movie is just dreadful and awful I've seen video games with more realistic acting then this movie it has one of the worst scripts that isn't worth being used as paper towels. The cast was just a sloppy mess they clearly show signs of disrespect.The protagonist is one of the worst to ever had been created she is just one that should have never been thought of and she makes me sick.They try to combine Science fiction and horror and they fell miserably they focus too much on the gore and even going so far as to cut a man open on screen that was when I got up and left the theater because I don't want to see that kind of junk in a movie it was just disgusting. They of course added a sex scene that should have never been added and a puke scene why do they love having that in the movies I'll never know but those three were enough to say I had enough.
 
There is just nothing that would even make it worth a rental and I really wish we had a rating for Zero on here because that's what Annihilation deserves it is one of the worst movies I ever seen in my life and I will be sure to avoid this one at all cost.I give Annihilation an 1 out of 10",1,10,21,31 March 2018
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Mix feelings
","Well I knew I would have to review this movie sooner or later being this was the only film I saw in theaters in 2011 which I wish now I saw more but it is what it is.I love Transformers and as you know from my reviews of Transformers Movies, Video Games and TV Shows I am a huge fan of the Transformers however I know not all Transformers can be perfect and this movie prove to be that.Transformers: Dark Of The Moon prove what happens when you're not paying attention to anything. Everything about this film just feels disappointing.The Autobots: Optimus Prime (Voiced by Peter Cullen), Sentinel Prime (Voiced by Leonard Nimoy), Ironhide (Jess Harnell), Ratchet (Voiced by Robert Foxworth), Sideswipe (Voiced by James Remar), Mirage 'Dino' (Franceso Quinn),Bumblebee, Wheeljack 'Que' (Voiced by George Coe), Wheelie (Voiced by Tom Kenny) Brains (Voiced by Reno Wilson) The Wreckers Roadbuster (Voiced by Ron Bottitta) and Leadfoot (Voiced by John Dimaggio)The Decepticons: Megatron (Voiced by Hugo Weaving), Starscream (Voiced by Charlie Adler), Soundwave,Barricade, Shockwave (Voiced by Frank Welker), Laserbeak (Voiced by Keith Szarabajka) and Greg Berg voices Igor.The voice talent and their performances are what I like best about this movie and it was awesome to have Mr.Nimoy return to Transformers because anything he touches turns to gold. As I set in the theater listening to his voice work I can't help but think of Galvatron the role he first performance in Transformers. It's good to have Peter Cullen and Frank Welker in the film together since they are part of the Transformers for so long and you can't have one without the other.The plot of the movie was good enough as it did have a tense story line Action scenes in the film are the rewarding part as you are given tense and extreme battles. The music is also very well done Also the Special effects are just awesome that is enough to make you go wowThe disappointment I have with this film is that the comedy was really Bad comedy they try to push the comedy and I swear it just so bad that I wanted to cry. The human characters the new ones are pretty much awful and just really insulted my intelligence it just made you wish they added more transformers instead of more stupid human characters who are not even worth the screen timeThis in my opinion is the weakest of the films yes I know 'Revenge Of The Fallen' got a bad rap but this one deserves it more because it is like a wreck on a wreck while it does have some things to make it watchable.What I like the best of the film is The voice performances of the cast, the music and the action scenes that are just what you hope for in Transformers. What I hated the most is the human cast who are just pretty much the worse punch line in the history of punch linesBut the plot, the action scenes and the voice performances are the redeeming features of this movieI give Transformers: Dark Of The Moon an 7 out of 10",7,6,7,6 June 2015
Back to the Future," Great Scott What a Masterpiece
","Back To The Future is one of my most favorite movies ever created. Just everything about this film is pure golden I can't think of one thing that would make Back To The Future bad because it just one of those films that got something right from the start.The film gave us some of the most used and most creative catch praises that we are still using even more after the film's release. It's one of those films I can always sit down and enjoy because it everything that makes it a pure classic.The idea of Time travel is always pure interest and it made the film a hit from the Get go.The music in the film is just superb often times you'll find yourself thinking about the theme song because it really matches the film story throughout also 'The Power of Love' from Huey Lewis and the News really works well to help with Marty McFly and his love for girl friend Jennifer.The cast did a excellent job with creating some of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema Michael J.Fox was brilliant as the film Main Protagonist Marty McFly he helped created a character that most could related to in their teenage years he was the right man for the job. Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown was no doubt the perfect choice, Christopher Lloyd has always been an amazing actor and like many grew up watching his performance in this film he was just phenomenal in this role one of the smarter casting choices ever he really brought the character to life. Thomas F.Wilson as Biff Tannen was quite the antagonist he just brought back all that we know and hate about bullies and makes you want to cheer for Marty.Using the DeLorean as the time travel car really gave the car it status as part of American motion picture history every time you see the DeLorean you think of Back To The Future. The effects in this film are nothing short of being magical and even today remains impressive.Back To The Future is like a fine wine only gets better with age that's saying something for this classic masterpiece I give Back To The Future a 10 out of 10 Great Scott! When this baby hits 88 miles per hour you're going to see some serious hit",10,4,6,24 July 2015
Jurassic Park," Welcome To Jurassic Park
","Jurassic Park, a movie that has been apart of my childhood and I have seen it in theaters along with seeing it in 3D for the 20th Anniversary. Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg who was inspired by the book of the same name written by Michael Crichton. What makes Jurassic Park such a milestone in motion pictures is the fact that the film is the first one to bring Dinosaurs to the screen with creditable mix of pushing C.G.I. to the limit and using Stan Wilson's Studios animatronics work and to this day the effects are superb and the Dinosaurs look very much alive in the film they did a great job bringing these creatures to the screenJurassic Park still reminds one of my favorite films even today because it's one of those films that are masterpieces and being I love Dinosaurs as a kid it was just perfectThe plot of the film centers around Paleontologist Dr.Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr.Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) get involved by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to his theme park off the coast of Costa Rica where he owns a island Isla Nublar Along Dr.Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldbulm) and Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to visit his theme park he calls Jurassic Park where they have cloned Dinosaurs and brought them back to life. After an accident where an worker was killed they asked to give their opinions on the park to keep the investors at ease. They are later join by John's grandchildren Lex and Tim Murphy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello).Along with these characters we are also introduce to Ray Arnold (Samuel L.Jackson) who helps run the parks computer systems with Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck)Just when it seem everything was going as plan the power suddenly begins to fall in the park leaving the fences to the dinosaurs to be shut down letting the dinosaurs free and the visitors fighting for their lives.The plot of the film does feature some from the novel but it is pretty much original from the story that was written and it worked like a charm with the story being a story driven action thriller that has kept viewers on the edge of their seats each time they watch it. From the story to the climax of the film you are given a thrill ride and story driven film.The Dinosaurs feature in the film are Tyrannosaurus Rex,Velociraptors, Triceratops, Parasaurolophus, Brachiosaurus, Dilophosaurus, and Gallimimus they are detail to make them look and feel like real Dinosaurs it still a beautiful piece of art to see how well they give these animals justice and gave movie fans a wonderful look into how these animals might have been in the past. Real and C.G.I. The Dinosaurs are just amazing to watch on screen. The movie brought something for everyone from thriller action scenes to moments that made your heart race the film deliver on so many levels with the infamous Break out Scene of the T-Rex to the Raptors in the kitchen Jurassic Park has created some of the greatest moments in movie history that leaves you on the edge of your seat at the same time be in awe by the film's impressive work of art.The cast worked very well together to bring the story to life and they pick the right stars for these roles, Sam, Laura, Jeff, Richard and everyone made the character memorable along with classic lines from the film like 'Welcome To Jurassic Park' 'Hold onto your Butts' 'Ah ah ah you didn't say the magic word' Music in Jurassic Park is just phenomenal with Mr.John Williams doing the score for the film anything he touches with his music turns to gold his music is like listening to a story and it just beautiful. Every piece of music he wrote for this film is masterpiece in their own right such as 'Welcome To Jurassic Park' 'Dennis steals the embryos' 'Remembering Petticoat Lane' 'A Tree for my bed' the music just fits the film perfectly.I can't find nothing bad to say about Jurassic Park it is just one of the greatest films ever created and one I can watch over and over still love it. It's just one of those films you can't help but respect. I give Jurassic Park an perfect 10 out of 10Welcome To Jurassic Park",10,3,3,9 June 2015
The Simpsons Movie," The Simpsons Movie On The Big Screen
","For The Record I like the old Simpsons I have not been watching the new Simpsons for so long I use to watch the Simpsons back in the day but now I don't.However The Movie is really worth watching no matter if you're a fan of the Simpsons or not.The Story of the movie starts off as Homer Simpson adopts a pig after he was going to be killed but Homer saved his life but then things starts to change as Marge starts to think he is a bad sign. Lisa Simpsons tries to convince people to change their ways but no one but one boy named Colin who starts to form a relationship with.Soon Springfield became the most unclean city in the United States so the President and his right hand man Russ Cargill places a City size dome over Springfield.Homer and his family become the target of the angry mob of those who live in Springfield and Homer, Marge,Bart,Lisa manage to escape the dome and now they are on the run.The Story for The Simpsons Movie really is smart for a movie based off the TV icon also they really know when to make some of the jokes work.The Music feels like the TV show and it has the theme song as well.The Voice acting is very strong with half the cast from the show reprising their roles for the movie.The Animation is really strong and well done with all of the animation being hand drawn which helps out the movie very well.The Simpsons Movie really does well by making itself a strong player in the movies and does make itself a great movie to watching for fans and movie goers alike.I give The Simpsons Movie a 9 out of 10.Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig does whatever a Spider-Pig does. Can he swing from a web no he can't he's a pig Look like heres Spider-Pig.",9,2,3,30 April 2011
Draft Day," Drama film for Football fans
","When I first heard of Draft Day it did get me curious because it's rare to see a film center around the NFL let alone the Draft.What makes this film work for everyone is that it appeals to both drama fans and Football fans or sports fans for that matter.The film does a interesting job with getting us a inside look at what the day in the life of a NFL team can be like and there is more to being in the NFL than some are lead to believe. It also gives us a good look into the human side of football players that are in the Draft, but also to show that each player has something worth fighting for. It goes to show that the Draft is always full of gambles and you see that in this film with these players and how the staff of football wrestle with their consciences.The acting in this dream is very well done with the best performances going to Kevin Costner and Jennifer Garner who work very well together I enjoy their performances, also Denis Leary Chadwick Boseman, Frank Langella performances are worth nothing as well as they show the character of all lines of work in the NFL.The story was well written and works for both fans of sports and drama which is rareOverall if you get the chance give Draft Day a try you might be surprise plus cameos are features from players and announcers from the NFL With a good story, Kevin and Jennifer's performances and strong character showing this is a film that you have to watch. I give Draft Day an 8 out of 10",8,2,3,26 September 2015
Dodgeball," You pay for what you get
","History is strange when you look back on things and this is a example of what were they thinking?Yes I admit I was force into watching Dodgeball and it is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most goof up movies I ever seen in my lifeThe movie does feature some good one liners but other than that the movie just feels strange and the writing is one of the worst I ever seen
The acting is decent but nothing too shine out outside Vince, Ben and Christine's performances
Overall I give Dodgeball an 7 out of 10",7,1,1,1 January 2019
