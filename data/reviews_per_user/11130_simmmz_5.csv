Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A sensational film that lives up to all the hype!
","After watching 'Kill Bill Volume 1', I was somewhat apprehensive about paying money to go see Volume 2. I'm only 16, and had never watched a Tarantino film before so Volume 1 seemed quite bizarre. With that in mind, I still enjoyed the film but volume 2 is a totally different experience. Tarantino focuses more on the characters and storyline more so than spectacle, but still provides the audience with tension packed fighting and toned down blood and guts. Uma Therman is absolutely terrific as 'The Bride', giving the character emotional depth, but still with the same brutality as Volume 1. Kill Bill Volume 2 is unique, different and amazing entertainment. A sensational film that lives up to all the hype!",10,0,1,11 June 2004
Sucker Punch," Packs less of a punch, on more of a suck....but still B-Grade fun.
","After the appallingly low approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes (currently sitting on just on 22%), I was apprehensive about spending $10.50 to watch Sucker Punch - and although this is far from the huge success it could have been (given director Zac Synder's potential), it is far from the enormous travesty many reviewers are making it out to be. The outstanding opening sequence reminded me of Synder's gift for visual flare. It plays out almost like a silent film, to a pumping remix of Sweet Dreams, telling the story entirely through visuals. Pretty soon after Baby Doll (Emily Browning) is incarcerated, the screenplay enters b-grade territory...and the cast of beauties ham it up nicely (as does Jonathan Hamm, as the labotimist).The feisty Sweat Pea (Abbie Cornish) carries a strong physicality on screen, and possesses incredible beauty. I couldn't take my eyes off Cornish when was within a frame. It was like a vortex. Jenna Malone gives it her all, but Vanessa Hudgen's was weak, but it is Emily Browning who milks it for all its worth, with a bit of 'tongue-in-cheekness' poking through her performance. And yes, the fantasy sequences are incredibly well staged and there are some stunning, eye-popping moments. Sucker Punch's weakness however is perhaps the connection between the fantasy sequences to the real world. There are no clever flourishes that link the two, and thus nothing feels at stake during the action. They remain pure fantasy within the film, and unlike, say Inception, the action feels gratuitous and self- conscious. The screenplay flounders in the final third as it tries to ground itself in reality and create emotional resonance. The sacrificial ending is questionable too - something more empowering would have been wise given the subject matter. Sucker Punch isn't intelligent - but it is thrilling. I would consider it far more of a b-movie than most critics are taking it for - and I am entertained by b-movies. Given the high quality of Watchmen, it is perhaps disappointing to see Synder revert back to his 300 days and it remains a shame that Sucker Punch doesn't strive for anything more, given its potential. Let's just hope Superman will give audiences a bit more to chew (or suck?) on.",6,0,1,30 May 2011
The Shining," A well deserved classic.
","My first viewing of Stanley Kubrick's classic 'The Shining' left me somewhat...underwhelmed. As a 15 year old boy, my underdeveloped, action oriented brain, desired gore and cheap thrills...something that this film avoids. Viewing 'The Shining' as an adult however, was a truly unforgettable experience. So here are my two cents....Hearing the term 'adaptation of a Stephen King novel' makes me want to vomit. With such duds as 'Storm of the Century', 'Rose Red' and 'Tommyknockers' falling within this category, I was sceptical. But thankfully, Kubrick diverts drastically from the source material, playing down the supernatural elements of horror. The fear of the characters' deteriorating mental health, and the potential of what they could do to one another, is far more terrifying than the threat of ghosts. This makes for a human, relatable, and intelligent horror; more frightening than the typical ghost story. Kudos to the screenwriters for taking a chance.Like most Kubrick films, the performances are strangely enigmatic. Shelly Duvall's portrayal of the seemingly 'desperate to please' Wendy, was irritating in the initial stages of the film. There was a self-consciousness to the performance, that felt slightly superficial. HOWEVER, when the hysteria sets in, Duvall delivers the goods. She is chillingly authentic, and utterly electrifying. It actually heightens the experience in the final third of the film. Apparently Kubrick was a prick to her on set in order to 'push her' into that place...so thank you for that! It's magic. I find Jack Nicholson a difficult actor to really warm to, and his performance here is no exception to that. It's over the top, comical, frightening...and unpredictably mad. I think I would have preferred Jack Torrance to be a more likable character in the developing stages, but nonetheless, he is fascinating. And Danny Lloyd would have to go on the list of 'best child performances ever'. The facial expressions, body language, and the eyes, are completely believable and nuanced! They struck gold with him.Typical of Kubrick, the film is a visual spectacle. Even by todays standards, the cinematography is mesmerising - a testament to Kubrick and John Alcott. Visually, the film is so absorbing. The camera rarely stops moving, in inventive (but non-distracting) ways. There is a sense that the characters are being watched by 'another presence' that is constantly tracking their movements. The camera work is subtly unsettling.It is so refreshing for a modern audience to watch a film like this, that relies on a slow and contemplative build up, and resonating images for scares. There is a genuinely creepy tone throughout, and the climax absolutely soars with thrills. And, strangely enough for this genre, 'The Shining' gets better with every single viewing. A well deserved classic!",10,1,2,11 July 2010
Across the Universe," A truly breathtaking experience...
","Julie Taymor's psychedelic musical extravaganza didn't really do much to light up the box office, recouping only $29 million of its $45 million budget. Not many wanted to see this film. And it's a real shame, as I believe 'Across the Universe' to be a truly breathtaking experience on the big screen, and one of the most visually spectacular films ever made. But be warned, 'Across the Universe' works purely on an audio-visual level The main gripe I have with the film is that it lacks a necessary 'edge' when it comes to character. They all feel generic and the love story that forms the basis of the plot is dull. Being a musical, finding a great screenplay is always a difficult thing, especially when the entire plot is based around the lyrics of pre-existing pop songs. 'Across the Universe' can't escape from leering contrivances. For me, the most interesting aspect of the story was when Maxwell's return from Vietman. His PTSD, with traumatic flashbacks, could have provided a more compelling and unique plot. The love story was 'nice' but not absorbing but maybe I'm just not the romantic this was aimed at.HOWEVER, and it's a big HOWEVER, if you can deal with the stale narrativewow, is this a film to behold. The voices, the choreography, the use of colour, editing, lightingall struck a real chord with me, and resonated far beyond that initial viewing. 'I Want You', depicting the subscription process, would have to be one of the most brilliantly choreographed and photographed movie musical moments of all time. It's a magnificent scene, exemplifying just how a big musical number should be shot and edited. The hallucinogenic 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun', featuring cloned Salma Hayek nurses and flipping priests, comes close.The musical arrangements are respectful to the original Beatles songs, capturing the simplicity that made them so beautiful to begin with, but offering enough interpretation that they feel fresh. The vocal performances are consistently good throughout, and some are downright stunning ('I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' in particular). Evan Rachel-Wood and Jim Sturgess both have excellent voices – a cut above the average leads in modern movie-musicals.Even with my complaints, 'Across the Universe' is still so astonishing. Julie Taymor is a true visionary, and her boldness and determination can't be denied...but it's those contrivances that stop this from being a truly great film.",8,1,2,11 October 2010
Alice in Wonderland," A love letter to Helena and Tim....
","Let me be clear. I am in love with Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter. I want to live in their house. Perhaps in the hallway that conjoins their bedrooms. I am probably writing this review through rose coloured glasses. But I'm not a weird stalker, in case that is what you were thinking.I don't really know what to say about plot of 'Alice in Wonderland'I guess 'Return to Wonderland' sums it up. Alice (Mia Watachhowdospellitowski) is now a young adult in repressed Victorian England, under pressure to wed the wonderfully wet Lord Ascot ..But she escapes from an awkward encounter down the rabbit hole, where she reunites with old friends! But unfortunately she doesn't really remember muchand Wonderland is a bit screwed.but Alice is 'THE ONE' who will bring peace! Rah rah rah.So let me get the bad stuff out the waythe screenplay is not great. It does lack a certain 'something', and the script just doesn't sparkle the way it should. Lewis Carol's focus, and play, with words just isn't present in this, so enthusiasts of the source material may take offence And Mia Watachowski did have some wooden delivery AT TIMESbut she is enigmatic, with a great presence on screen. I can picture her as an artist's muse. She was memorable, and I'm sure will go on to great things.Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter was nicely Mad. I think there's a general 'getting over' of Depp happening at the moment, so people haven't been too kind in their reviewsbut the Hatter was an interesting character, enhanced by brilliant design. And the interchanging accent was a nice touch. Bonham-Carter is so perfect as the Queen, but I wont begin ranting about her greatness...But the Cheshire Cat almost stole the entire film for me. It was so beautifully animated. I was mesmerised every time it appeared.'Alice in Wonderland' is really all about the visualsBurton's Wonderland is enchanting. It actually went above what I would expect from Burton, visually, which is saying a lot. And for me, it was enough to lift this film above its major flaws. There was such an energy to the imagery. I saw the film in 3D, but I think no matter what mode it is viewed, the Art Direction is some of the most impressive to behold of late.But as much as it pains me to bring this up, I do have to draw attention to the 'Mad Hatter' funky dance. This wasperhapsthe low point in the careers of Burton, Depp and Danny Elfman. Cringe, cringe, McCringe cringe. If you have seen the film, and are over the age of 10, you will know what I mean.Basically, re-working a cult favourite like Carol's Alice, is, and was always going to be, a difficult task. I wish perhaps more time had been spent on developing a strong, unique storyline. The film could have been a masterpiece. Although a straight adaptation would have been a sure thing, I like that they took a risk. I still went quite gaga over thisand I know kids will go nuts too.And Helena and Tim, if you ever read this, please contact me. I'll be your butler or something. I'll do anything.",8,1,3,20 May 2010
