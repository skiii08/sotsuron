Ford v Ferrari," AMAZING
","I really wasn't expecting much going into this film witha average expectations, but this us easily one of the best films I have seen in a very long time, years. The fast paced cinematography and racing scenes, well driven plot and excellent acting makes the film amazing; even for one who has no interest in racing at all. Definitely a must see and I cant understand how this will be snubbed for all the awards.",10,1,1,7 January 2020
