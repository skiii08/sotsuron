Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is actually good
","For everyone to bad mouth this movie I would like to ask were you watching it just to compare it to the first one? Or were you actually interested in the upbringing story of this kid Anakin Skywalker? here is my thoughts as to why I think this movie was actually pretty good where others totally just crap on it saying it was bad. This might contain spoilers if you haven't seen the movie yet, or the Anakin trilogy. Sounds weird but it's true since these three parts actually are about Anakin and also the war.Now on to the first movie which is this one right here. This is actually a good start to a franchise that was already established and great since the 70's with Star wars: A New Hope. This Prequel however opens a lot of doors as to what was really going down before the events of A New Hope and really answers a lot of questions, but also gives us more questions while it does so.People complaining that there is no Character Development on here. I suggest you watch it again and pay attention. these characters have such a great history behind them and are fleshed out as the series goes along. Also the special effects are decent here, but don't expect to much since this is a story piece movie and not a full blown action flick. I also don't agree that this 'was just for kids' I think that since this movie was slapped with the PG rating it made it seem so, but it wasn't. This movie was made more for people who know about the Star wars Universe than the 'kids' that are fresh and new to it. But it is a good place for the fresher eyes of the viewing audience to get an understanding as to what is going on.'Spoiler' If you haven't watched the movie I suggest you skip this part until you do watch it cause this is where it gets interesting and I try to break down the movie as best as I can. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escape Naboo and land on a desert planet Tatooine They meet a young boy by the name of Anakin. Qui-Gon later realizes that the boy has the power of the force within him. He then later finds out that Anakin has a large amount of midi-chlorian over 20k which no Jedi has. He then finds out from Anakins mother that she had a virgin birth if you think religiously somewhat like how Jesus was born. Also when they are deciding whether to train him or not they tell him that he is too old. and its dangerous to train him at this age (age 8). You also know that Anakin was created because of these cells, and in Episode 3 they throw in some epic information as to how Anakin was really created. But that is for a later review.As far as this movie goes everything is really decent the acting is good, the Characters are good, but have to understand these characters grow as the series does.the little you know about them in this movie is good. The dialogue wasn't bad at all and I thought the kid that played Anakin was actually good. To get more insight on these characters you have to watch the following movies. There is a great story being told, but they distract you with all this nonsense at times that can throw you off just like the old ones. Where as this one is the colorful jar-jar character and his race. And others along the way. I am not sure if these characters are thrown in just for the kids and the laughs, like 4,5, and 6 had. But my advice is to look past the crazy characters and focus on it's core. You will understand what they are trying to tell you, and leave you asking for more.",8,14,20,22 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The weakest out of the three, but still enjoyable
","If you haven't notice I am reviewing all three parts of this generations trilogy of Star Wars movies. If you haven't read my first review, I suggest you go do so before reading this one :)First I will like to say as an opening statement that this by far is my least favorite out of the trilogy. mainly because they focused less on story and gave you the meat and potatoes and just tried to satisfy you with action. While I'll admit some of the action scenes are decent, but they are not impressive. This one however does give you some information that should not be overlooked. *Spoiler* If you haven't watched it please do not continue to read. In this movie it's been about 10 years after the first movie, and as they try to fill in some gaps, and do a pretty good job at it. First thing you know is that Dooku who was part of the jedi order has shifted to the Dark Side. Obi-Wan discovers that a planet in the Galaxy map has been erased from their Archives and he further investigates into it. He finds the planet and then realizes that this Alien species is creating a clone army for the republic. The clones were modeled after Jango Fett The Bounty Hunter. The Alien tells Obi-Wan that Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas put in an order about 10 years ago, but this comes off as suspicious to Obi- Wan because this Jedi master was not with them he was gone longer than that. As he observes the factory you could say. He meets jango and he asks if he has ever met the jedi master, but says he's never heard of him and that his recruiter was Lord Tyranus. Now if you guys aren't aware Tyranus is actually Count Dooku. Count Dooku was the one who killed Sifo-Dyas and recruited Jango Fett from my guess under the orders of Darth Sidous. Also deleted the planet in their archive galaxy map. So in this case Count Dooku was actually behind these Clones. This also brings up that the Sith were indeed planning something from the start to take out the Jedi Council.Now if you guys watched the First movie Mace Windu (Samuel Jackson) notes that there has been no Sith activity for a long time. This somewhat answers the question that the Sith was indeed on the low for an attack. This information proves that they were indeed plotting something. Also Anakin in this movie is showing tension and believe that he is being held back. And with the death of his mother in this movie you can clearly see the darkness in his eyes that it's just a matter of time to take full control.The second movie like I said was weak, but did have some information on there that connected some dots. George Lucas has a way of throwing in some really good information to complete a puzzle, and also leaves to draw your own conclusion as to what you think is happening in the Star wars Universe. If they would have focused a little bit more on the story than just full blown action. I would have liked this more. I also understand where they were going with it, so it's not so bad.",7,4,8,22 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," My Favorite out of the whole series including the old ones.
","This is my favorite Star Wars movie out of the whole franchise. The build up to this was great, and the special effects were done a hell of a lot better than Episode 2 in my opinion. Everything in this movie worked. The Story, the action, the characters. Everything was done so well, and can easily be a rank 8-9 film in my opinion. This is the closing point to my review for this trilogy and of course there will be a spoiler.As a movie this is really well done. the scenery, the sets the Cinematography was all well done in my opinion. And also closed the trilogy really well to start off The old Star wars movies from the 70's*Spoiler* If you haven't watched it please do not continue. As we leave part 2 we found out a lot of things. The Clones was a plot against the republic by the Sith. Chancellor Palpatine is still the Chancellor after his run was supposed to be over, and the relationship he is building with Anakin is a little suspicious if you ask me. And Anakin is really showing true signs of the Dark Side from his anger and his hate. There is a scene when palpatine is talking to Anakin about a Sith Lord by the name of Darth Plagueis which for some reason he decides to share this character and story to him. He tells him that he is indeed one of the strongest Lords of the Siths. he is so powerful that he is able to manipulate the midi-chlorians to create life and to save those he loves.. Hold on a second That is indeed interesting because in the first movie Qui-Gon tells the Jedi's that Anakin was created because of the midi-chlorian and that he had way to much of it cause no jedi has that much in them. If you put this information together it could possibly be that Anakin was indeed created by a Sith. Also why would palpatine share this knowledge to Anakin? This can be the answer we was looking for. In the first movie which I didn't reveal was that Yoda didn't want to train him because he was dangerous he had to much anger and hate within him which he thought was because he left his mother back at tatooine. But it could be mainly because he had this Dark force lingering because of Darth Plagueis. What makes this even more interesting is that Palpatine is Darth Sidious who recruited Count Dooku and was behind the Clone creation with Dooku. From what I understand if I heard correctly the Jedi master was Darth Sidious. Also Sidious puts the information in Anakins head that he was Darth Plagueis apprentice and he was the one who killed him. This is where the deception comes in. The Prophecy that the Jedi thought might not have been true. In the prophecy Mace Windu explains that this one Jedi was going to come in and destroy the sith. But Yoda says something really interesting that what if they read the prophecy wrong? It could be that this jedi was going to help the sith and destroy the Jedi from the inside. This could have been Anakins destine path. In the first movie it was weird to see Darth Maul. But he might have just been a pawn in the whole plot, or it could be that something didn't go as planned and this is why palpatine took action and became Chancellor. These answers leads to more questions.This is by far a great trilogy, and breaking it down was fun. As a whole its indeed great and worth it. I would like to request that George should redo 4.5 and 6 again with modern tech and expand on this. I believe that the old trilogy while they are great. I think falls flat in comparison to the new Trilogy. I believe if it was redone with new visuals and a more structured story it would be better than how it sits now. Because watching 4,5, and 6 in a new light it's pretty dull compared to these three in my opinion. and i think it will make a better epic tale for the Franchise.",9,1,2,22 November 2011
