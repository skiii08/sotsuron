United 93," The Most Important film of my Generation
","This was the most moving film I think I will ever see. I liked this film because it did not sugarcoat 09/11/01. It brought back some familiar feelings I had that day fear, confusion, anger, and hope. I thought it was very accurate. I think this is the right time to see this movie while 09/11 is still fresh in our memories. It changed our lives and the world we live in. It made us see what evil and hate can do and how it can change our everyday lives. Those who oppose are entitled to their own opinions, but I think its important for people to face reality and not forget what happened. The acting was realistic, the build up was tense, and the climax was so unforgettable it made it hard to sleep that night after i seen it. Definitely worth at least one viewing to every single human being.",10,4,9,1 May 2006
