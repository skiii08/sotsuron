The Blair Witch Project," A movie which can not be copied.
","the Blair witch project is an amazing film which cannot be re-done or copied. the movie shows us that even without the token killer, super natural creature shown on screen, can the audience be truly terrified. TBWP is one of those movies which makes us use our imagination to create the effect(which many horror movies are using less and less of)of what the characters are in fear of, as we do not know what is there with the use of the hand held camera not facing on what they are running from or to. this movie leaves the audience feeling that if there might be something out there in the woods, which many after watching this did feel.",7,0,2,31 October 2005
