Antz," A highly anticipated...flop
","I had entered the theater with an open mind upon the opening of DreamWorks' initial animated feature, 'Antz'.  Finally, I felt that there would be a perfect film for children.  However, before the film was over, I was in a state of wonder how a film for children could be so inappropriate.  Now, before you get 'antzy' (sorry!), I'd like to note the entire toy collection of 'Antz' figurines, clothing, action figures, and the like aimed at children under 7.  In addition, the commercials for the film (which showed a festive dance and bright picnic scenery) were continually aired during young children's programs such as cartoons on FOX, NBC, ABC, etc. where only an imbecile wouldn't know that kids were watching.  So naturally, any concerned parent would be skeptical over an MPAA rating of PG when the merchandise was aimed at a G audience.The violence is quite appalling and the language pushes the PG rating.  I don't disapprove of animated movies for adults (think Japanese anime), but when films can literally claim bloody murder and receive a PG rating, I find it completely and absolutely horrifying.  When will film studios learn that a completely entertaining film can be created without profanity?  Within every scene, the absolutely vulgar and horrific cast screams out a four letter word.  Other family movies with PG ratings can produce quality work without uttering such pointless drivel such as 'James and the Giant Peach', 'Hook', and 'Matilda'.  Compared to these traditional family films, 'Antz' hardly measures up.  And this barely touches upon the movie's punctured plot.I was disappointed that such a promising company as DreamWorks would stoop so low to collect the final dollar.  It's the parents which fork out the money for the film, most of which ADORE the violence and vulgarity...the perfect target.  Where DreamWorks may have produced quality family fare, they spit out another traditional movie flop without the heart and warmth needed to be entertaining for the ENTIRE family.",1,12,30,23 July 1999
The Iron Giant," Family entertainment takes a dive for the worst.
","At the preview for 'The Iron Giant', my kids could barely hold their excitement.  They've seen the commercials and knew several of the characters already.  In advance, I had warned them that there weren't any sidekicks or catchy songs as they've been accustomed to.  By the end of the film, their eyes were downcast...and it wasn't from sleep-deprivation.The film isn't all that it was hyped to be.  Much of what you see in the commercials is the whole film...why go to the theaters?  The commercials tell you everything!  Moreover, the story isn't widely original, either. If you've ever watched 'We're Back', 'Pete's Dragon', 'All Dogs Go To Heaven' or 'E.T.' (all children/family movies) then you've already watched this film.  It's the typical plot about children who find an amazing discovery, keep it a secret, abuse its powers, and learn to extend beyond their own feelings.  For my children, probably the most damaging to the plot, however, was their dislike of the giant itself.  There wasn't enough to connect him with the audience which undermines the emotion the rest of the film builds on.  Without the connection between such a key character, the audience loses interest.Furthermore, the movie's animation barely matched with current releases. There weren't as many lush color tones or smooth-running lines to make the film visually appealing.  Don't get me wrong, Warner Brothers has had great animation in the past (although its last ventures 'Quest For Camelot' and 'The King and I' were complete flops).  If they'd only stick with Bugs Bunny, they'd have the works played out in their hands.  'Space Jam' was wildly successful, plus the shading and colors of 'old' characters brought new life to their persona.  In several aspects, 'Space Jam' was far superior from animation to plot, aesthetics to witty lines when compared to 'The Iron Giant'.  Where past Warner Brothers animation aimed toward the family, 'The Iron Giant' aimed for the commercial.  Several times, the topic of Superman (a character which Warner Brothers owned) was brought up.  Soon, we'll see Superman figures lined up with the corny Iron Giant banks and toothbrushes.Lastly, there's the objectional material.  For the first time in my life, I saw the main character of a cartoon, feature-length movie use the restroom. The use of the bathroom is all too common in live action films, but they've begun to pass surreptitiously into cartoons.  Why does such a scene need to take place?  All in all, the film relays an anti-government atmosphere. The main characters are always on the run while officials heartlessly chase its 'victims'.  I admit, several children's books are perfect for Hollywood. This one may have been one if taken from a different approach.",1,12,62,24 August 1999
