Skyfall," The opening sequence is worth the price of admission alone.
","The opening sequence before the traditional Bond credits and title song is worth the price of admission alone. This a high quality made action film. It's beautifully shot in some amazing locations, not often seen on film and features some excellent performances from Craig, Bardem (he does creepy so well, it's well creepy...), Dench and one of the Bond girls in newcomer to English language films and stunner in general, Bérénice Marlohe.I thought it dragged a bit in the middle where there was too much Bond flirting with the ladies and not enough action or suspense and the other Bond girl played by Naomie Harris irritated me. Although I found moments in the film rather amusing, in particular some gold from Judi Dench, the script was a little too cheesy, even for a Bond film, but it was a very enjoyable and fun film and the action sequences were excellent.",8,4,11,19 December 2012
Looper," A frustratingly good ride
","A frustratingly good ride, it could've been an exceptionally good film. So much of this sci-fi, time travel film is excellent. The performances, the styling, the concept are all really very good. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really showing his diversity of late and does an excellent Brice Willis impersonation. Emily Blunt is as always, a fantastic screen presence and the film really lifts to new heights once her character enters the story. The fact that it takes so long to get to that part of the story is one of it's main faults. The film's set up is intriguing and stylish and interesting, it just drops the pace and interest a little too much in the 2nd third and throughout the film there is a completely unnecessary sub-plot involving an inept baddie that just highlights what a fantastic film it could've been, had his character and story been reduced or removed all together.Still a great ride and good film though, it just could've been a classic.",8,1,4,2 November 2012
