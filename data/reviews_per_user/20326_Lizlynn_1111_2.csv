Hereditary," This movie is terrifying
","Hereditary has fully succeeded in scaring me! There were times when I wanted to either close my eyes or just turn it off because I was on the verge of not being able to handle it. Very few movies have ever had that effect on me. Definitely one of the best, most disturbing, horror films I've ever seen!",10,1,2,7 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I have mixed feelings about this one
","It was entertaining enough and I liked that everything ended on mostly a happy note but it all felt very rushed. I could feel the desire to 'fix the last Jedi' and the need to hurry up and close storylines and introduce new characters to open up new storylines. They just crammed too much into one movie.I liked that Rey was considered 'a nobody'. Actually I think it was one of my favorite things about this new trilogy because that meant anyone could be special no matter where you come from and I was disappinted to find out 'who her parents really were'. She was also so overly powerful in this one to the point where it was getting to be ridiculous.I also don't feel like they spent nearly enough time convincing me that Kylo Ren was abandoning the dark side considering he spent 2 movies moving towards it and in a couple of scenes he's totally turned against it. I do think that HOW he turned back to the light was endearing though. Thank goodness for Adam Drivers great performance...I always found General Hux to be very entertaining and I was very irritated on how his character was killed.honestly, My favorite scenes were the ones with C-3PO and the Ewoks at the end.",7,4,8,23 December 2019
