The Longest Yard," Stayed true to the theme of original
","I was disappointed in this version of The Longest Yard. While it remained true to the original in most respects, where it varied usually was a detraction. Especially the changing of 'I think I broke' The quote they changed it too was lame. Casting was the biggest downer. I didn't think either movie's Caretaker fit. Chris Rock to be honest would seem more like one of the cheerleaders than a Caretaker. Adam Sandler doesn't have the toughness Burt Reynolds brought to the role. The Warden was as badly cast in both movies as Caretaker. No edge to them, too comical a figure when they are all of the drama in the movie. Switowski was perfectly cast in the first movie. His role diminished and really badly cast this time round. In short I think they took what could have been a really excellent movie and did minimum effort to get it out the door. No magic, no chemistry like the original. Little added and lots taken away from the original. Why did they bother?",5,0,0,25 June 2005
Constantine," Well done movie. Lots of action, excellent special effects. Not one to cherish
","I found the world constructed by this movie to be interesting, the images of hell were I think a bit of tongue in cheek and stolen from another famous movie. LA with flames equals hell. Not sure if the flames are necessary.The demons were extremely well done. The special effects well done. The acting smooth and believable. The action was plentiful. Just not memorable. Nothing that just grabs you and stays with you. I watched the movie and enjoyed it. Would have watched it in the theater if I had been able and felt my money was well spent. I likely will not buy the DVD because it is not a movie I'll watch over and over again. It is a movie that could easily spawn a series of movies. A Holy James Bond of sorts.There is material that zealous Christians may find offensive.",8,0,3,7 August 2005
The Others," Excellent, pulls you in and never lets go.
","If you have not seen the movie you should. You should also not read any more of the user comments. It is well worth it.
Very few movies have grabbed me. This one did and did not let go.",8,3,4,2 September 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," Big let down.
","I looked forward to the movie as a sort of super disaster movie. The science of it looked hokey even in the previews. Watching the movie it continued to seriously decline. The acting was mostly so so with Dennis Quaid seeming a bit too stereotyped.The movie starts out with Jack Hall a climatologist preaching the evils of global warming to a delegation and insulting the VP of the US. All through the movie I thought I should be at the church of Green Peace instead of watching a movie. After the initial sermon was delivered we were propelled quickly into fairly well done natural disasters which tended to have no real basis in the movie except to slip in death and destruction. If it were meant to show a sample of the climate change it focused only on the 'evil' industrial nations and ignored the likely more severe effects non-industrial nations would suffer.Then comes the storms. One of which leaves New York heavily flooded leaving Jack Hall's son and companions stranded in a NY City library. Their fight for survival is trivialized and social dynamics completely ignored. I never felt sympathy for the stranded nor did the preaching end at any time. Every scene had subtle political and social jibes. Few with any factual basis. Jack Hall soon as he is proved right by the disasters that only he predicted soon takes off on an epic journey, or what would be an epic journey that turns into a boring stroll to rescue his son.For a film that purportedly espouses environmental issues wolves are poorly portrayed in this film. So not only does the film do disservice to environmentalists with poor science it is an absolute insult to those who know wolf behavior. A polar bear would have been much more exciting and realistic as the danger to the stranded scholars (Jack Hall's son and companions).To cut a long and boring narrative short there are cut overs to Mexico blanketed in snow warmly accepting a billion or more US residents after initially closing the border. Lets see. Paniced refugees. A major countries Government evacuating an entire nation to Mexic. War would be a logical result. Mexico would not have the resources to support so many refugees. Where did Canada's population go or was Canada completely wiped out? What about nations in the South. The movie seemed to think only the Northern Hemisphere would be affected.I found this movie to be a grown up fairy tale for lip service environmentalists. There were some special effects that were cool. Other than that no real reason to see this movie unless you are extremely bored.",3,0,2,7 August 2005
Sleepy Hollow," Great atmosphere but never brings concept to life
",The visual aspects were excellent. The plot just never comes to life. The action is minimal and after modern horror flicks a headless corpse riding a horse doesn't scare anybody.,6,1,1,3 September 2002
Alien vs. Predator," Much better than it sounds.
","I loved Alien. I loved Predator. I was dragged to this movie. I thought it would be something akin to the Mummy battles Frankinstien. The writers did an excellent job of stitching such an unlikely plot together. Unfortunately that was where their creativity ended. Nothing new, nothing unusual. Low on blood and gore. No tension between the three sides. Good concept but too much time was necessary to make it possible to develop any characters or conflict. Special effects were good. What would a movie be without the overdone and boring explosion(s). One day soon they will make a movie with no characters and just show stuff being blown up.",5,0,2,25 June 2005
