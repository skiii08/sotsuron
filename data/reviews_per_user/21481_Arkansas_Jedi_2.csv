The Blair Witch Project," Unique, claustrophobic and the best scare in several years.
","Certainly one of the coolest movie premises in a while. The supposed raw video and audio footage from three missing film students who were lost in the woods while making a documentary about a Maryland witch.The first-person style -- we see only through the sometimes blurry, sometimes shaking camera lens -- adds to the rising terror of the three college students. It also makes the view almost claustrophobic as the trees always seem to be closing in -- especially at night.The movie beautifully builds the sense of dread and impending doom. We know what is going to happen; we just don't know when or how. Plus, we watch as three seemingly intelligent people basically fall apart.The film really kicks in during the final 30 minutes to the dizzying climax and haunting last scene.A must-see for fans of horror and suspense; also for movie fans who want to see something new and different. A campfire story for the home video generation. For outdoor types who see this, I guarantee it will cross their minds on their next camping trip whenever they hear a strange noise at night.",8,1,1,1 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A film for the young and young at heart -- smart ass reviewers be damned.
","Let it first be said that Star Wars was my formative movie experience. I was 6 when the first one came out and grew up with the series and mythology.George Lucas had an impossible job and he pulls it off for the most part. He had to make a movie detailed enough for the geeks like me who have waited for years and will now spend our time analyzing and picking apart each scene. AND, he had to make a movie accessible and fun enough for the younger generation now and an audience not familiar with the original trilogy.There are great action sequences, space battles, ground battles, light saber duels (alone worth the price of admission) and a futuristic drag race that ought to entertain the young and young at heart. Lucas also throws in some twists and details for us lifetime fans. Old acquaintances show up (and look out for the cameo of one well-known Spielberg alien).There are also some implausible plot twists, several cliches and some intended jokes that fall flat.But if you want to be entertained and revisit the Star Wars universe, you should have a blast. If you just wanna go so you can pick it apart and ruin it for the fans, please, do us a favor and go see something else.",7,0,0,1 August 1999
