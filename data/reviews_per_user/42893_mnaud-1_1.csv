Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Well written and a total riot.
","Just saw this last night at a screening in LA. It was sooo funny. Not sure when it will be out, and we were told that we were the first audience seeing this rough print. I must say that he built an entire movie on that one character. It will def. be rated R, as it has some pretty wild stuff. Some bathroom humor, yes, but all in all, it was great. Several scenes were so funny that you couldn't hear the film. The theatre was going wild at several points during the film. He makes fun of so many different things that anyone is fair game.I hope he continues to do his show and find the time for more films based on his wild characters. After seeing the whole movie, I was left wondering if all those people it is were actors or real people being caught off guard.",9,188,381,3 February 2006
