Requiem for a Dream," oh my god, what a movie
","After this movie was over, I couldn't do anything except lie on my bed, turn off the TV, and just be completely and totally stunned for a full five minutes.First off, it has the most interesting and engaging directing style I've ever seen in any movie.  I've never seen 'Pi,' so I'm not familiar with his work, but I was amazed at how many different ways he presented us with the information!  I can't even pick out a favorite scene, there were so many interesting cuts and techniques used.  And even in the one major scene where no unique editing was done (where Harry and Sarah are talking in her apartment after he bought her the television) the scene was perfect and gripping.Anyway, all four major perfomances were outstanding.  Not to rain on Julia Roberts's parade, because she did a fine job in 'Erin Brockovich', but Ellen Burstyn was seriously robbed.  I was also very impressed with Jared Leto--he's come a long way from 'My So-Called Life'!  It was the most amazing ride I've ever been on while watching a movie.  The ending sequence was so harrowing that it literally had me in tears.  I was completely floored.  It angered and disgusted me, but it also was probably the single most mesmerizing movie I've ever watched.In closing, I think that this film should be required viewing for every high school health class.  This is enough to scare someone away from drugs, I don't doubt that for a second.  10 out of 10",Null,0,0,3 June 2001
American Pie," So much fun!
","First of all, yes, I'm twenty years old and fell right into that minority of people who could honestly relate to this film.  Not that I ever was in any of the situations, but...oh nevermind.  But I thought that it was a great movie for people my age--sure, it was a bit overblown, but it was a comedy, remember that!!  the truth is that kids do think about sex, and by the end of the movie they've made the subtle point that it's not all it's cracked up to be.  sure, along the way they make it seem like the best thing ever, but in the changes in all the characters, the message is clear--kids may have hormones, but they're capable of real feelings and emotions.  I thought the acting was great--I've seen a few people's comments on here ripping on the acting.  All I can say is that these kids acted like real kids. I totally believed that they were people I could have gone to school with.  As for some people's comments that Natasha Lyonne was the best thing in this movie, all I want to ask is why is it that so-called 'film buffs' always denounce the acting of every teenager in a film like this, except the eccentric, anti-social one?  Honestly.  I understand that Lyonne really stood out in this movie, and she was good, but she was hardly the best thing in it.  I hate to make personal comments about people on here, but I think that if you're too old to appreciate the accuracy and humor (yes, slightly overblown and disgusting humor, but high school humor) of this movie, you really shouldn't be commenting.Great job on this movie.  The most fun one I've seen in a long time.  8 out of 10.",Null,0,0,9 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The silence said it all
","The thing that hit me the most after seeing this movie was the way that the audience, upon the turning on of the theater lights, simply rose as one and walked silently out of the theater.  Not more than a word was said, and I think that's the best compliment anyone can give this movie.  Out of all the teenagers and Gen-Xers that were in the theater, not one of us felt compelled to speak after watching this.  I can say that the opening sequence hit me harder than anything I have ever witnessed in my (albeit short) life. I found myself wrapping my arms around my knees, trying to hide my eyes but unable to avoid the horror unfolding on the screen.  I actually felt like somehow I was in danger.  The horror I felt as the soldiers stepped out of the boats into the gunfire was gut-wrenching.  All the movies we watch in school, all the History Channel specials don't even touch what this movie touched, honestly.  I never realized the horror of what D-Day and this war was until I saw this movie.  It took it out of the abstract and forced those of us who have never had to live through a real war to see it as they did. It makes me want to thank every one of the men who were in this war for what they sacrificed for those of us who live here now.  I don't know if I would be strong enough to handle it, and I hold as my heroes anyone who was.About the movie in itself, I actually thought the scenes at the beginning and end were touching.  A bit too theatrically staged, definitely, but I thought it was a nice beginning and end for the movie.  The battle scenes, enough said.  Phenomenal.  The one and only criticism I have is that I think the script was a little weak in its character development.  I had a hard time really feeling for the characters, and I think that maybe the battle scenes were emphasized so much that we lost who the men really were.  It's hard to develop characters while the audience is concentrating on gunfire. However, this was an excellent, excellent movie, definitely, a 9 out of 10.",8,0,0,28 January 1999
Good Will Hunting," Titanic who???
","I loved this movie.  I absolutely loved it.  I was fascinated by every single aspect of it.  Sure, the plot wasn't the most realistic, but who cares?  Movies are entertainment, and that's all.  The profanity was not that excessive if you spend any time at all with many lower to middle-class people around the age of the characters.  In fact, it was downright realistic. As for the acting, it was wonderful watching Damon portray this character who has to struggle with what he thinks he wants, what he is told he should want, and what he finally realizes he really wants.  No, I don't think it was the best performance of the year, but it was definitely one of the top five and worthy of a Best Actor nomination.  The chemistry between him and Minnie Driver was electric, particularly during their first date and again in the scene in her apartment before he leaves.  Robin Williams, in my opinion, delivers his best performance.  Sure, it's the typical Williams-drama character from Dead Poets Society and the like, but this character was better with the mental games and interactions with Will.  The best part of this movie was watching the relationship develop between Will and Sean.  This wasn't an epic movie, nothing too profound, but it was a small movie about love, relationships, and finding yourself, and in this capacity I think it was wonderful.  9.5 out of 10.",10,0,1,28 January 1999
The Graduate," Great movie
","First of all, I'm 19 years old, and seeing this movie makes me realize that a lot of what went on in the 60's is still relevant today.  Nearly everyone I know who graduated around my time is just as unsure of their future and open to suggestion as Ben is in this film.  What do we do?  Do we settle down with what is sure to be a stable future ('Plastics'), or do we sow our wild oats, as Ben did?  This movie isn't about having affairs with our parents friends, not at all.  It's about confusion, about a million people telling you what to do and you just wanting to tell everyone to slow down, just let you rest for a second.  This movie was great, but I can also understand how some people wouldn't think it was that great.  If people come out of graduation knowing exactly what they want to do with their lives, they will probably see this movie as simply about a slightly disturbed kid sleeping with an older woman.  However I think many people see it for what it really is.I agree...Dustin Hoffman's performance was wonderful.  It nearly made me nervous just watching him portray the nervousness of Ben.  He was terrific. I, too, was really struck by the scene at the end.  Ben and Elaine have run off, they're going to be so happy...yeah right!  There they sit in the bus, not talking to each other, just staring straight ahead.  Sure, they're excited, but for what?  And that seems to be life.  Decisions are made irresponsibly and too quickly, and things rarely turn out the way you imagine them to be.  The ending was sadly perfect.  It may be over 30 years old, but this movie is still completely relevant to today's youth.  A 9 out of 10.",Null,1,3,28 January 1999
Scream," Fantastic
","I love this movie.  I absolutely love it.  I hate the horror genre, I hate teen movies as a rule, but I loved this movie.  I don't understand why Hollywood lets anyone except Kevin Williamson write these scripts. Disturbing Behavior, Urban Legends, and all the other non-Williamson movies have been, in a word, pathetic.  The best part of this movie is how throughout it, they make a complete mockery of horror movies, and yet come up with one of the scariest ones I've seen in a while.  This total self-satirizing style kept me laughing when I wasn't screaming, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.I don't think Wes Craven or Kevin Williamson 'rediscovered' the teen horror genre.  I don't think it's really a genre worth rediscovering, at least based on the recent flops that have been released.  It's only through the brilliance of Craven and Williamson that this movie was so wonderful, in my opinion.  I wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much if it wasn't so cleverly written.  I give it an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,26 January 1999
