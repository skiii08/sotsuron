Hereditary," My kind of messed up
","I went into the movie expecting to be terrified so I was a little disappointed at the end when there had been no twists leaving me screaming.
That being said...my expectations were based on others discribing it as the scariest movie ever.
The movie was super creepy and more of a psychological rollercoaster ride than scary...which made it a better movie in the end.",8,2,3,2 March 2019
