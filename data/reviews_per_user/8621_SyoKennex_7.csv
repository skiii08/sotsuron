Captain Phillips," Definitely not as bad as I first thought
","I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be terrible; a lot of people I knew really didn't like it at all. I put it on in the background whilst I worked on some writing I had to do purely for the noise.That never got done; I ended up glued to my television screen.I'm not going to lie or sugar coat this movie. It starts off really, really slow. It doesn't really pick up and become entertaining until around the first chase, which is around twenty minutes, half an hour in, if I remember rightly. From there, however, it really picks up and had me glued to the screen.The acting in this is absolutely stunning. Tom Hanks did amazing. I felt so many emotions for his character, and connected to him - and isn't that what you're meant to do for characters on the screen? Connect and want to help / look after / etc? Everyone in this film acted really, really well and I was honestly taken aback by the quality of the acting itself. The casting director did such a brilliant job choosing the leads and the supporting cast. Each actor did such an amazing portrayal, and they deserve a round of applause for sure. Hanks portrayal of shock and (what I assume to be) post traumatic stress disorder was absolutely unbelievable. He did wonders in this role, and I'd love to see him in more things like this.The plot itself is well known, I suppose. A ship taking cargo to Africa, being hijacked by Somalian pirates. It doesn't sound great, but let me just say, the suspense in this was absolutely amazing. My heart was pounding and I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie when things got faster. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.This was, overall, an amazing movie and it's definitely one of those that you need to watch and form your own opinion on for sure. This is such a beautiful movie, it deserves so much praise.",8,0,3,20 April 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Refreshing; The Original Marvel Standard
","From the Studios that brought us Iron Man, The Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy comes Spider-Man Homecoming, Peter Parker brand new for the third time.Please remember this review is my own personal opinion.I have to admit straight away, I didn't think I would enjoy this. I'm a large fan of The Amazing Spider Man series with Andrew Garfield and was not happy when I heard that Marvel had bought Spider-Man back from Sony, and would be recasting and remaking the series to fit into The Avengers universe. After really not enjoying Civil War at all, and their current movies (save GotG) lacking, in my own personal opinion, I was not looking forward to this. I went with my family, excited for the movie, and sat in my cinema seat really not happy at all. However, within just a few minutes of the film, I was glued to the screen, eyes wide, laughing away and I found myself totally absorbed. The first I noticed, was that the humour was much better than in previous Marvel movies, and it was mostly relatable. He was just a teenager, excited to become a superhero, and the humour was for the age range that were mostly there to see the movie. It was well done, and a very good choice on the script writers part.The cinematography was really well done; I didn't find anything I was unhappy with during the movie, and the acting was all absolutely spectacular. You can tell everyone worked really hard for this movie, and it definitely paid off; everyone was brilliant. This is the standard of Marvel movies that I expect, and it reminds me of the movies back at the start of the series, long before they become the long political and not very interesting movies they have been recently. There needs to be plenty more movies like Homecoming in Marvel's future, as this was absolutely brilliant. It was refreshing, and it brought back what I personally loved about the series. This has been Marvel's best movie in a while; I hope to see more like this in the future.",9,3,6,7 September 2017
Hidden Figures," A movie that is just out of this world
","Where can I even begin with Hidden Figures other than this was the movie of 2016 for sure. We follow three black women who work at NASA, aiming for their dreams and suffering through the oppression that black people went through during the 60s. This really opened my eyes to the oppression black people went through. I've heard of it before but never really knew how bad it was until I watched this movie. It was terrible and the things that people go through in this movie? There are still people alive today that went through this. This really was still quite recent. It's mind blowing to think about, really. Our characters are three strong black women that don't take crap and it's beautiful. They hold their heads up high and do not allow the oppression to get to them. They do what they can in what they're provided and they kick ass. Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe gave absolutely beautiful performances and they are definitely some actresses to watch out for. I can't wait to see what else they bring to film. I actually did a lot of research into Friendship 7 before watching this, and the plot was really true to fact. It's really wonderful to see that the script writers and such did a lot of research into the events that happened. The cinematography in this movie was stunning. I was really taken aback by how wonderful it was and the film creators did an absolutely amazing job with it. I would gladly watch this movie over and over again. My only qualm was that the timing seemed to just phase and we were supposed to know immediately. These few times really threw me off and it took me time to reconnect to the movie and realised what was happening. Other than this, the movie was absolutely stunning. A definite 9.5/10 from me for sure.",9,3,8,2 April 2017
Don't Breathe," Hold your breath, then let out a sigh of despair
","When this was advertised for the cinema, it looked amazing. The trailers made the film look like the masterpiece horror of 2016, not to be missed at any cost. After all the amazing reviews I read for this, I just had to sit down and watch it. I love amazing horror movies, and this seemed like the one that was going to be the best for the last of 2016, and the start of 2017.This movie started off terribly slow. It didn't catch my attention at all, and I found my attention wandering and thinking about other horror movies I've been meaning to watch. Eventually, our main characters get to our veteran's house. There's still nothing to really drag you in at this point in time. It's not until about half an hour, forty minutes into the movie when you're really dragged in.We're thrown in straight away into a tense situation that makes the viewer shiver and get goosebumps. You end up rigid on the couch, trying not to make too much noise. You watch in fear as our main characters struggle through an almost Saw like situation, trying to break out of the veteran's house after breaking in. Then we have some weak fight scenes that again, made my mind wander, considering what movie to put on next.Spoilers in the next paragraphAfter this we have some very disturbing scenes in which he tries to artificially inseminate the female main character with things that are explained better within the movie than what I could do. I thought this would be a movie where disability =/= weakness, but it ended up with the disabled being totally psychotic and plain vile.Spoilers over.This movie doesn't end. It just continues on and on to the point where it's just overkill and no longer entertaining. The female character ends up becoming strong, finally, and it's welcome to see, but it was mostly a boring movie. I was glad when it was over, and I turned it off as quickly as I could. Give this film a miss; it was over hyped, treated it's disabled character terribly and also lacked decent characters. A definite failure of the horror genre.",4,0,4,30 March 2017
Beauty and the Beast," An eloquent, classic romance renewed
","26 years after the classic Disney film was released, Bill Condon directs Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.This film was absolutely stunning. I sat and watched my childhood on screen with real people for the first time in my life, and I am not ashamed to admit I shed a tear once or twice. I grew up watching Emma Watson as Hermoine, so seeing her on screen as my all time favourite Disney Princess was highly emotional. The cinematography in this took my breath away. Every frame of this film was stunning. The cinematography was beautifully done. The costume designs were so expertly done, they all looked like they were direct from the animated film. The casting was done so stupendously it was like the original animations had just stepped out of the film and began waltzing across the screen. The only two qualms I had were <ul><li>It seemed to take Emma Watson a while to warm up to singing. It was very rough in the first song of the film, and then she seemed to get better as it went along.</li></ul><ul><li>The pacing of the film seemed quite rushed. I understand they were pretty much copying the original animation, but I feel like it could have been paced out just that little bit better. I felt a little out of breath watching it, whizzing from one point to another. </li></ul>Those qualms aside, this still took my breath away. It definitely deserves the hype it got. This was a wonderful retelling of such a classic tale. I hope that this generation of children may enjoy this as much as I enjoyed the original growing up. They deserve a movie like this, full of love, hope and romance. And of course, the age old moral, don't judge a book by it's cover.",7,1,5,30 March 2017
Arrival," HALF of the best sci fi movie of 2016
","This was advertised as the 'best sci-fi movie of the year'. We have maybe, half of the best sci-fi movie of the year.Arrival promised from the trailer an amazing alien landing film, with the leads of Jeremy Renner and Amy Adams watching them. We expect from this, action, horror, violence and world domination. We got something much different. It was a chance well taken, pulling alien sci-fi out of the tropes it has been left to rot in. There were a lot of different routes it could have taken and this one was well chosen, Denis Villeneuve (Prisoners – 2013; Sicario – 2015) definitely made the right choice. However, my issues with this film, lie within the cinematography. The shaky camera frames, the silent soundtrack, the hearing everything as Louise heard it as things were happening were all extremely disorientating. The film could have been made a lot better without these things, and with less experimental techniques to make the film unique – the plot alone was unique enough. The plot of this film, as before said, was amazing. Humans teaching aliens their language, and vice versa. It was highly unique, and showed great techniques.The unfortunate thing about this film was that it didn't kick off until an hour and ten minutes into the film. It was a total let down and a shame. However, it was a heavy trudge through to get to the action in the film.It was a shame, truly, that this film was advertised so big and for it to be such a let down in the first half, and it's only being rated a six out of ten.",9,0,5,30 March 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Saviour of the Spy Genre
","I've watched Kingsman: The Secret Service many times since it's release in 2014, and not once have I ever thought it deserves less than 10 stars. In a world filled with films that just end up following numerous tropes and becoming overdone, Kingsman is a refreshing film that reminds us just watch spy films are meant to be.We follow the story of Eggsy, a young man with an abusive stepdad, who loves his mother more than anything. After getting into trouble with the police, he is signed up to undergo training to become a possible Kingsman, a gentleman spy ring. At the same time, the world's new criminal mastermind is just starting to unveil his new plot to take over the world.I think the first thing about this film to note is the humour. It's absolutely spot on. It really captures British humour and shows what we're about. There was nothing that didn't fit right into the movie and the feeling of it, and everything flowed along brilliantly.The second thing, is definitely the cinematography; especially during the fight scenes. George Richmond did an absolutely amazing job, and I'm very interested, just from the church fight scene, to have a look at other films he has done cinematography for. He has a real talent for it, and it definitely made Kingsman even better. The acting on everyone's part was absolutely brilliant. It's obvious that everyone put a lot of work into their roles, and with legends such as Michael Caine, Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth it's not hard to see why the acting quality is so high. With breakthroughs actors Taron Egerton (Eggsy) and Sophie Cookson (Roxy), Kingsman proves high on its casting quality and Reg Poerscout-Edgerton did an amazing job. With such films as Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron and The Man from U.N.C.L.E under his belt, it's not hard to see why he was picked for the job.At the end of the day this is a gory, wonderful new retake on the spy genre, and it does absolute wonders. With humour to suit most people, a heart breaking underlying story line, and a massive villain with an up to date way to take over the world, Kingsman proves itself in every aspect of film making, and is a blessing to the cinematic world.",10,1,2,13 September 2017
