Mission: Impossible III," Meh
","For those who follow Ethen Hunts sagas or just want a good action movie go ahead and see this its a good movie. But having said that I sat down and thought about it after i watched it and i came to the conclusion that it has a very weak plot line with a semi-unfinished ending, the Bond like gadgets are awesome but when they are all linked together by a couple things the movie just seems lacking. I believe that the first movie is by far the best, the second was meh, the third better then the second (but thats not saying much). Big explosions, okay acting, and Tom Cruise (that crazy, couch jumping maniac) make for a enjoyable film but definitely not an Oscar candidate.",7,0,1,7 May 2006

","I realized that many people have seen this and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I knew that the film was a vampire romance, two genres that should never be mixed, so I simply asked myself: sparking vampires who stalk teenage females, how bad could it be? To my dismay what I found was a very shallow, tiring, detestable film. Let us first begin by looking at the writing. Perhaps some of the funniest dialog that I have seen in years, this film becomes increasingly disagreeable with every passing moment. With such immortal words as: 'You know, your mood swings are kinda giving me whiplash,' and best of all: 'I'd compare (my life as a vampire) to living on tofu and soy milk,' it seems obvious that I cannot take this film seriously. I distinctly remember literally falling to the floor laughing for most of it. I would love to say that this was where the horror ends but of course there was the sub par acting to contend with. Awkward moments punctuated by horrific gazes, this was a clumsy performance from both main actors. I only wish they would spend their newly found fortunes on acting lessons. The only item which I believe was tolerable was the directing. While there was nothing new to add to the cannon, with such an atrocious script and actors, I realize the director had a lot to contend with.I would beg the reader to never see this film. It was horrifyingly bad on nearly ever level, not worthy of its hype or fan base. Please avoid at all costs.",2,11,192,18 July 2009
