Come and See," Come and See Review
","This is a masterpiece of war movies. Come and See takes us with the main character, Florya, to another 'world'. We can feel those character pains and struggles. Come and See is the warranty that we fight for no reason, and while in war our life have no meaning, and we give up our lives in order to fight for reasons that 'have no reason'. The psychologist horror is more painful to watch than the physical violence. The movie is so real and 'touches' all of the audience senses that we forget that we are actually just watching a movie. In my opinion, the end of the movie is absolutely brilliant, superb. Watching the 'flashback' of Hitler's life until his picture as a baby, a baby just like many other that died because of him and his Nazi's ideals.",10,1,1,1 August 2010
The Battle of Algiers," La battaglia di Algeri (1966) film class review
","In a society that is more concerned about how people look than with what people are, this movie is timeless. It could be a recent story, and even though the movie was released in 1966. The Battle of Algiers is full of energy and suspense. For me, one of the most values of the movie is the soundtrack. Ennio Morricone did an excellent job, as always. One of the most intense moments of the movie is when the three women are acting like French and while transporting bombs with them, part of this intensity his portrayed by the music. The movie also provides a 'clean' and impartial view of both sides, the French and the Algerian.",7,0,0,30 May 2010
