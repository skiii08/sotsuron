Lucky Number Slevin," New York Movie with an L. A. Feel...
","That seems to be the best way to describe this particular film. I've thought about it for days, and that really seems to be the best.Lucky Number Slevin comes out of the gates strong and never really lets up.Slevin's New York-ness comes from its location (no-brainer, guys), which while self evident is important. Movies that are set in New York always have a certain urban panache that is unrivaled. While its true that I couldn't find (or remember) and proof that the city in Slevin is in fact New York (shot in Montreal), it still looks and feels like New York. Subject also plays a role, as the gangster motif can't help but invoke feelings of the New York mob scene.Art direction take the film across the continental us, and leaves it firmly in L.A. Visually, the movie feels more like the Elmore Leonard movies than anything else. Pacing, interior decoration and the humour all seem to have the west coast feel, standing in contrast to the east coast elements.This in no way detracts form the movie, which is by far one of the better films I can remember watching recently. Some people don't like the surprise plots, where the clues add up and the twist is revealed. Some people figure it out to early, some people never figure it out at all. I think if you don't try to hard, though, this film does the twist well. Sit back, and enjoy the show. Follow along, but try not to jump the gun. I think it'll be more fun that way.Technically, this film plays out well. Some of the camera work is superb, a bit noir by times, but not always static and close. The interior sets are sumptuous and stylized, but not to the point of absurdity. Bold prints and vibrant colors dominate, making the film a really beauty visually.Cast, lead by Hartnett, is fantastic. His performance is spot on. Cool, calm and collected, with just the hind of stupid innocence that makes the whole character work. Kingsley and Freeman bring years of experience to their character. Watching such seasoned actors is alway a joy. Liu is good in her role as romantic interest, and Willis is picture perfect as a contract killer.This is one of those movies that I just can't not like. This film is excellent on several levels. Dialogue is good, production value is high, set design, cast, camera...I haven't quite got my new, reformed rating system off the ground yet, but it will involve a series criteria for a film that will influence the final mark depending on how well the film meets them. I think that this one would do well by any set, although I heard form some that it was two violent. I don't agree, but hey...My girlfriend loved it, talked about it for days.Must see for fans of the genre, Great movie all around.",8,1,3,6 November 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Who are these people?
","who exactly are the strange people in the movie?This is the question I asked myself continuously as I watched Little Miss Sunshine, and it was only at the end of the film that I was able to answer it.Following a last minute road trip in a VW van with a children's beauty pageant as a destination, the film revolves around the family of the child-star who is trying to audition, Olive.Played by Abigail Breslin, trained by her heroine addicted Grandfather with little ability to self-censor, needs to make it to a beauty pageant as a last minute spot becomes available in the line-up.Alan Arkin delivers excellently as the Grandfather, with withering commentary and perverse logic backed up with such dominating personality that no-one is really able to argue with his strange points of view.Steve Carell is also quietly brilliant as Frank, the suicidal gay uncle academic who is only joining the family so they can keep up the death-watch, and Paul Dano does a good job as the troubled teen brother. Kinnear and Collette perform well as the 9-steps-to-success obsessed father and the desperate mother.Faced with the internal and external struggles of this lot, its no wonder that one asks, who are these people? Well, folks be the end of the movie, in what has to be the creepiest example of cinema verite I have possibly ever scene. My skin crawled at the skeevy-ness of all the beauty pageant scenes, especially the announcer, who, quite frankly, made my blood run cold. As it turns out, every one of the contestants, save Olive, was an real pageant winner, in costume and performing the same talent routine as their winning pageant. This only makes it that much worse, I assure you.So it turns out that the people in the van are the normal ones, just like you me and our Grandfathers, and the people at the pageant are the ones we have to worry about.It's a clean win for the everyman.I can't help but give this one a Must See, even if you don't feel like it tonight...",8,1,2,11 February 2007
The Incredibles," Great Movie...
","The Movie Network is a wonderful thing. I don't think I ever would have bothered re-watching this movie. Don't get me wrong, The Incredibles is a fantastic film, but I'm not sure I would have gone that extra mile and rented it again. But there it was, on the Movie Network. So, given the easy access, I decided to give it another go.I enjoyed the Incredibles the first time I watched it, on the recommendation of a friend with a kid. I had heard good things in the press, anyway.I gotta say, I enjoyed it this time around as well. Pixar really has the whole animation game down pat. the look and feel of this movie is spot on, cartoony, but as slick as hell...The story might not have any real surprises, but the premise is fun, and the idea of suing a superhero for doing their job had me laughing out loud as I thought about it. A fine reflection on the litigiousness of our society...the storyline about the celebration of mediocrity was spot on as well, I thought.Jason Lee is always a treat, and the rest of the voices, especially that of Helen Hunter, are fantastic as well.4 outta 5.",8,0,0,4 August 2006
The Illusionist," A nice looking period piece with some good performances.
","Overall, I enjoyed the movie. I suppose it might be because I'm a fan of Eddie Norton. Could be. But I think that there's more to it than just that. Firstly, Paul Giamati. Can't really go wrong, can you? Secondly, Jessical Biel. Solid performance, easy on the eyes, who can complain? And even though I have no idea who he is, I thought that Rufus Sewell did a good Job as the Crown Prince. And Austria is a pretty place, by the look of it.Director Neil Burger seems to be doing his first major motion picture here, and he does a pretty good job. The look of the picture is good, and it never really seems strained, not enough to really throw anything. The cinematographer went up for an Academy, and it was deserved, I say.Beautiful to watch, with actors that can hold up under pressure. I don't want to get into the story, but its good, a bit of a new twist on an old tale.Rent it, Watch it, Then Rent The Prestige. It's fun that way. My girlfriend liked it. Enough said.",8,0,0,6 March 2007
The Da Vinci Code," If you've read the book...
","I finally got around to watching it! The Holy Grail of Religion Studies movies!Thats right...The Da Vinci Code.Let me preface this review by saying that in general, those who approach religion in an academic setting (like myself and my colleagues) generally don't have much time for stuff like The Da Vinci Code, where completely false theories are given credit they don't deserve, and millions are convinced of something absurd.I don't feel that way. I liked the book. It was fun. It was not an insult, because reading a page-turner with cliff-hanger chapters and a ridiculous plot is a good way to waste a day. So intellectual elitism aside, I think the book is worth the few hours it takes to read. And I think Angels and Demons is even better...But I need to suggest that if you read the book, you can probably skip the movie. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table. A lot of time passed between my reading the book and seeing the movie, so maybe I slipped out of the groove, but the adaptation seemed dogmatic, and lacking in any real creativity.The historical flashbacks were a good idea, I think, and and interesting mechanism to get around the storytelling that takes place in the novel, as were some of the visual effects used to demonstrate Prof. Langdon's thought process. There are hardly reasons to rush out and buy/rent this movie, however. Some of the performances were pretty good, all in all. Its always a treat to see Ian McKellan, and I liked Hanks, even though I remember there being a general outcry around the time of the release. It's true that I didn't feel the chemistry between him and Audrey Tautou, which may have improved issues, but French/American relations have been strained, so I don't blame them.One of the best parts was watching the City of Paris, where I spent a month this summer. Nice place, that Paris...So, overall, I give the movie a 'Only if there is nothing else on TV'. My Girlfriend didn't watch it, so no vote there...The book is worth a read over the holidays if you have nothing to do, as well...Just don't believe everything you read...",6,5,9,10 December 2006
Casino Royale," Best Bond Ever?
","So, I finally got around to seeing Casino Royale. It was one of those movies that I really looked forward to, and then somehow never dragged myself to a theatre to see. I have problems making dates to go to movies with people, something I feel I ought to remedy, especially after my recent viewing of 300 en salle.Nevertheless, having finally saw, and subsequently discussed, Casino Royale, the major question seems to be 'is this the best Bond ever?'Needless to say, this is a complicated question. The simple answer is a resounding 'Yes'. Hands down, this Bond film makes the others look stilted and amateurish, gadget happy and trite.The more complicated answer might still be yes, but qualified with respect to the older styles, the Proto-Bond statues of Sean Connery, and the understanding that modern technology can make a film look a whole lot better than back in the day.A lot of the credit for the astounding quality of the new Bond must go, of course, to Daniel Craig. When first I heard the rumor that he might be the new Bond, I was worried, and I kept my fingers crossed for the other guy, rumored to be Clive Owen. I had seen his stoic and quietly powerful King Arthur, as well as the strange but well done I'll Sleep when I'm dead. After watching Layer Cake, I was less certain, and eventually threw my vote in on the Craig side. I believe I was right. Craig makes a fantastic Bond, with all of the charm required and a physicality that most closely resembles that of Connery.I didn't really appreciate the story on any real level, but I'm not sure that matters all that much. I watched Goldfinger recently as well, and the story wasn't much to get excited about there, either (and what, exactly, was attractive about Pussy Galore?).Casino Royale's great strength also lies in its hearkening back to a younger, less experienced Bond, who breaks more rules, an more bones. The simplicity of a prequel lends a lot of weight to the production, and moves away from the ritzy, tech-guy bonds that began with Roger Moore.Bond fans will also appreciate Bond's drinking habits in this film, a far cry even from Brosnan's shocking Mohito in Die Another Day.Basically, this film is a must see, a Rent It Now, and Tell Your Friends, with out any reservations.",9,2,7,20 March 2007
V for Vendetta," V for Vendetta...I'm hooked...
","I knew from the very first review that I was going to like V for Vendetta. I'm always curious, and a bit leery, of how much that feeling towards the movie, sight unseen, affects my viewing of it...I was right, of course...I really liked this movie...However, I watched it after its DVD release, long after the aforementioned reviews...I had only the recommendation of a friend from work and from the owner of my local video store. So how biased was I? who knows...But the film does deal with the power of an Idea...and while my idea that I would like the movie is not anywhere near the grand scale of the 'overthrow the Government and stand up for freedom' idea that drives the film, maybe it had power all of its own...By the time I watched this film, I had forgotten that it was connected with the makers of the Matrix series, the Wachowski brothers...The film, on the whole was fantastic. I cannot stress how good Hugo Weaving is as V, the main character, given that his face is covered by a mask for the entire film. Despite the loss of the most important means of visual inter-personal communication (facial gestures), Weaving delivers a stunning performance. The scripting is fantastic, so make sure to pay attention to the monologues. Portman delivers a solid performance, and a quiet Stephen Rea is a masterful detective/skeptic.The film is both solidly constructed and beautifully shot. My one problem with the film, however are the special effects. Some gratuitous cg and un-necessary, particularly in the final fight scene. An earlier scene, involving violence, is well done, using editing and other conventional techniques to portray the characters prowess. The final scene resorts to poor cg and looks entirely out of place in the otherwise real looking movie.Nevertheless, this movie deserves to be watched, and well. Don't expect an action movie, but be prepared to think. Not as many conflicts of philosophy as the Matrix, but still one worth thinking about.Over all, this movie definitely rates a 4.5 outta 5, and my girlfriend, much to my surprise, really enjoyed it.",9,1,2,21 September 2006
