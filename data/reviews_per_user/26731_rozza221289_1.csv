Raiders of the Lost Ark," Unbl***y believable!!
","this movie is by far one of the best of all time!! i mean the story line is great, and don't even get me started on Harrison Ford. (he was made for the party)... with out a doubt it is definitely one of Spielberg's greatest achievements!.. ranks up there with jaws Schindilers list, Jurassic park, close encounters and not forgetting E.T!! there's not much more to say except, i would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone as it satisfies all audiences.. i would have to say that out of the whole trilogy (soon to be quadigy)this is my personal favorite, it pretty much invents ideas which are now clich√©s.i cannot wait till the fourth instalment hits us, and it will hit us hard!!",10,0,0,5 February 2007
