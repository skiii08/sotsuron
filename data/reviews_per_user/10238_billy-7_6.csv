Antz," A great family film
","This fulfills the REAL definition of 'family film' better than any movie I've ever seen; it's an experience that can be equally enjoyed by parents and children.  It's action-packed and possessed of fun animation for the kids, and it's witty and satirical enough for the grownups.  The voice characterizations are superbly done, with Allen, Stallone, and Walken being particularly effective.  Stallone, in fact, hasn't been this good since the first (and only decent) 'Rocky' film.",10,0,0,5 October 1998
Requiem for a Dream," One of the greatest
","This is one of the handful of great films from the year 2000, an unforgettably powerful look at drug addiction and its effects.  It could easily have become a hipper 'Reefer Madness,' but because of the extraordinary artistry of the director Darren Aronofsky and superlative performances by Ellen Burstyn et al, it becomes a classic cautionary tale. Unpleasant in the extreme--but a must-see by any standard.",9,0,0,23 October 2000
Erin Brockovich," Total entertainment
","Julia Roberts's best film to date also features her finest performance, as well as great supporting work by Albert Finney, Marg Helgenberger, and Aaron Eckhardt, and a stalwart cast from top to bottom.  Steven Soderbergh does a fantastic job of providing an audience-delighting comedy-drama that makes you laugh, makes you cry, makes you whoop and holler. It's closer in spirit to 'All the President's Men' than to the movie it's bound to be compared with, 'Silkwood.'  This one isn't in 'President''s rarefied league, but it puts 'Silkwood' in the shade, and Julia trumps Meryl handily by being not only fully up to the emotional demands of the part, but by being hilariously funny as well--and physically a dream.  Finney hasn't been this good in years, and Eckhardt displays the kind of charismatic charm one couldn't have guessed he had from 'In the Company of Men.'  This is a genuine winner and an instant super-classic!",10,1,1,22 March 2000
American History X," Flawed but extremely powerful film
","This is a movie which must be seen if only for the powerhouse performance by Edward Norton.  He's given brilliant support by Edward Norton as his younger brother, Beverly D'Angelo as his mother (her career high), and Guy Torry as his prison pal.  The director has complained publicly about the treatment he's received, but he comes off looking swell, so he should probably commence to take the high road before he appears even more of a loon than he does already.",Null,0,0,30 October 1998
Rear Window," Great again and again
","Saw the movie again (for approximately the 20th time) at the Film Forum in NYC this weekend, and what can I say?  The negative was 'restored' and looked, I guess, better than ever, but frankly, this movie would be great no matter how bad the negative was.  It's an incredible achievement which works in spades no matter how many times you've seen it.  It's Hitchcock's best, and one of the very best movies of all time--if not the best.  I keep switching it from #1 to #2 and back again on my own all-time best list. Numbers don't matter.  The movie is great, great, great.  Can't wait to see it again!  (The DVD should be fantastic.)",10,0,2,23 January 2000
Rear Window," The absolute best!
","I cannot for the life of me understand how someone could give this creme-de-la-creme masterpiece a rating of 8 out of 10 stars (our previous correspondent).  This is simply the best thriller ever put on film.  It has literally everything you could ask from a film--a fantastically romantic story, suspense, great photography, great editing, the finest achievement of them all by the best film director of all time, and one of the most chemically exciting man-woman pairings ever.  Stewart and Kelly virtually DEFINE screen chemistry.  Neither one of them ever met another co-star they had anything like this much sexual charge with.  WHAT A MOVIE!  (Rating: 11 out of 10).",10,0,2,30 October 1998
