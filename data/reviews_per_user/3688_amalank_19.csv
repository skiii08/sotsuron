The Expendables 2," Satisfying
","All the action heroes from the first movie are reunited in this movie, plus a few extras and a little bit expanded roles from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis.I loved the first movie and scored it 10/10 mainly because a lot of action movies before have been disappointing when it comes to action. This sequel also contains enough action to satisfy although it could have been a bit better by extending one or two of the action scenes in between Another thing that would have made it better was to include a car chase which the first movie had. The storyline is not a very good one but when it comes to a straightforward action movie like this one, its what you would expect. This movie is style over substance, so don't go in expecting Shakespeare or whatever. It also contains a lot of good humour making it funnier than most overrated if not bad comedy movies. And as one of my friends pointed out, Jean-Claude Van Damme made a better villain than in the first one.Even though I thought it could have been better in one or two ways, I still liked it. Lets hope Expendables 3 will take this on board.",8,2,4,23 August 2012
Cloverfield," A supposedly clichéd movie taken to a whole new level
",Let's face it. The idea of a movie about a monster attack in New York City seems like an idea that has been used over and over again that people don't want to see this sort of thing ever again. But Cloverfield manages to overcome this. How? Well it uses the hand held camera technique. Then it places you right in the centre of the action by having the camera being held by one of the characters. Plus the camera being used is a typical everyday-use hand held camcorder. These factors really make this movie exciting and intense. I remember seeing this movie in the cinema and I was really on the edge of my seat while watching it. The tension really is maintained throughout.The final result is absolutely pleasing.,10,1,2,13 August 2008
Fast & Furious 6," Arguably the best movie in the franchise
","The sixth and latest installment in the Fast and the Furious franchise sees Agent Hobbs ask for the help of Dominic Toretto and his gang help track down a wanted criminal.I have to say that this was the movie I was most looking forward to in the 2013 Summer blockbuster period, and I'm glad to say that I got what I wanted from it.The movie had a lot of exciting action sequences which made it an improvement to the previous movie. Given that a lot of action movies lately have been disappointing mainly because of the lack of action, this is continuing the resurrection of proper action movies following The Expendables movies and The Last Stand. Let's hope this path remains open. Being a UK citizen, I loved the idea of having it set in London and having some of the action scenes take place in London, even though they were actually filmed in Glasgow. It made good use of the London scenery and it was nice to see the fabulous Rita Ora make a cameo. It also had a lot of humour which made it funnier than most bad comedy movies and even some popular ones which in my opinion were overrated (*cough* The Hangover *cough* Ted *cough*). The story-line wasn't exactly good but then again, none of the story- lines in any of the movies in this series are. At the end of the day, it's more style than substance. If I have one criticism to make, it's that one or two of the stunts were unrealistic. But let me put it this way - at least it's not as bad as a lot of really terrible and over-the-top Bollywood movies.I seriously think that this is the movie that should've rounded off the franchise rather than make a seventh movie for next year. All I can hope for now is that without Justin Lin on board, they don't mess it up.",9,3,11,19 May 2013
Elf," More suited for kids
","It's Christmas time and being a massive movie fan I decided it would be appropriate to watch some Christmas movies. I hadn't seen Elf so I thought I'd give it a go.So Will Ferrell plays a human who was brought up by elves and decides to go and find his real family.Now there are a few Christmas movies which I enjoy but unfortunately this isn't one of them. I found it minimally funny. In fact the humour was a bit too childish for my own liking.I was never really a fan of Will Ferrell. I found him a bit silly and I don't think he fitted the role. I think his role would have been better suited to someone younger.Please forgive me for being like Scrooge but I did not enjoy this movie. If you want a good family Christmas movie, watch Home Alone instead.",3,3,9,20 December 2015
Man of Steel," Best Superman movie so far - don't trust the critics!
","The Superman franchise is the latest to get the reboot treatment. With Warner Brothers having had success with Christopher Nolan's rebooted Batman series, they decided to bring him on board for the Superman reboot. It has worked very well.This movie has somewhat taken the same route as Batman Begins did with exploring the origin and beginning of Superman which really added substance and more depth to the protagonist. While the Christopher Reeve movies had a more light-hearted tone to them, this movie is more grounded and gritty. The old Superman movie theme tune and red trunks on Superman's suit are gone which was a good thing.While the action sequences were admittedly over the top, they were still great fun to watch. The special effects were also fantastic.I have to say that I am bewildered that this movie didn't get great reviews. Then again, I've come to realise that movie critics can't be trusted because they really don't know how to enjoy movies and end up taking them too seriously. It's not the first time either. They have also given negative reviews to other popular movies including Taken and Man on Fire. So the take home message is simple - don't trust the critics!Arguably, this is the best Superman movie so far. Christopher Nolan's touch has really worked here. The long-term hype was worth it.",9,3,9,6 July 2013
Coriolanus," Good adaptation of a Shakespeare play
","This is a movie adaptation of the William Shakespeare play Coriolanus. I had never heard of this play before and I suppose its a good thing to have another Shakespeare play adapted in comparison to the more well- known ones including Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet.Even though the play itself takes place in ancient Rome, Ralph Fiennes decided to make a modernisation of this play. I have to say that it has worked very well and can be compared to Baz Luhrmann's modernisation of Romeo and Juliet, even though I thought that particular movie overall was just watchable. I am not actually that fond of Shakespeare's plays mainly because I find it so difficult to understand the language he uses which isn't used in this day and age. But this movie told me that he knows how to write a good story. Even if you had never read or even studied this particular Shakespeare play at school, you can tell that the dialogue in this movie is typically Shakespearian. But despite this, you don't really need to understand the language in order to understand what is going on in the movie. After all, it's much more difficult to understand if you're reading the text alone. I guess it was better to use the Shakespearian text rather than modernised English given the setting of this movie. Ralph Fiennes played his role very well, especially when his character becomes angry.All in all, this is good movie adaptation. Even though I never intend to read any of Shakespeare's plays, I guess for the first time I appreciated Shakespeare, not for his language but for his story.",8,1,3,9 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Nothing special really
","The Amazing Spider-Man is supposed to be a reboot of the Spider-Man movie franchise. Tobey Maguire is replaced by Andrew Garfield in the protagonist role of Peter Parker. His main love interest switches from Mary-Jane Watson to Gwen Stacy, and the villain in this installment is Dr Curt Connors aka Lizard. As expected, this reboot goes back to the beginning when Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man only it is told in a rather different way to the 2002 movie. This time they also try to add a bit more character oriented storyline.Is it a good movie? Yes, particularly since I saw this movie in IMAX. This made the action scenes more exciting to watch. It also uses a villain that hasn't been used in the previous movies so at least it does make it different from the previous movies.Is it a successful reboot of the franchise? In my opinion, not really. It's been five years since the last Spider-Man movie came out, and ten years since the movie franchise was first introduced. Even when they made the announcement of this movie being made, I was questioning it because it's just too soon to make a reboot. For the same reason, this reboot is not refreshing. Without trying to give anything away, you can recognise that this movie takes some of the elements from the 2002 movie. The character oriented storyline doesn't add that much meat to the character of Peter Parker as its supposed to. Its easier to count this as another installment only with different actors playing the roles.I really enjoyed the first three Spider-Man movies, and yes that includes Spider-Man 3. This new Spider-Man movie is also enjoyable but it fails to refresh the series. It seems that I was right in thinking that its too soon to do so.",7,238,400,7 July 2012
Captain America: Civil War," What Batman v Superman should have been
","Captain America: Civil War is the third Captain America movie with a similar theme to the more hyped up Batman v Superman. While Batman v Superman was an enjoyable movie it failed to live up to the hype. So it was up to Captain America: Civil War to redeem the theme of superheroes facing off against each other, and I'm glad to say it did that.It has a better storyline and it delivers it much more systematically unlike Batman v Superman where it was very slow. It was also able to utilise other Marvel superheroes in a much better way than Batman v Superman. We also get a bit more background behind the characters portrayed in the movie. And the action is a lot better compared to your typical superhero movie.I really enjoyed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and thought it was the best movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But Civil War manages to just about match it. The Russo brothers have once again managed to do a fantastic movie. The good news is that they will also be directing Avengers: Infinity Wars Parts 1 and 2 so I'm really hoping that the Marvel Cinematic Universe will be better from here on. As for DC, standards seem to have slipped since Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Either they need to get Nolan more involved or take a leaf out of Marvel's book if they want Justice League to be successful.",9,11,24,1 May 2016
Pearl Harbor," Could have been better
","This is supposed to be a World War 2 based movie. Its the sort of movie anyone would expect to be an accurate enough dramatisation of events that actually happened.Instead what we get is an attempt to make another Titanic by including a love triangle that is dominant over the whole history aspect. It just doesn't seem right.Being a historic epic, they could have cut down on the whole love story and focused more on what would have been relevant such as the Japanese preparation of the attack and the situation President Roosevelt was finding himself in. The sequence of the actual attack on Pearl Harbour was spectacular! Perhaps if they extended it and made it a more major part of the film it would have been more worthy. Another major flaw with this movie is that after the attack sequence the movie dragged on for another hour trying to give an epilogue which was totally irrelevant.I reckon if these were taken aboard, then Pearl Harbor would have been a much better movie and perhaps would not have flopped at the box office.",5,22,42,17 August 2008
The Bourne Legacy," Not as good as the original series but good enough
","The Bourne Legacy loosely takes off from the events that took place in The Bourne Ultimatum and continues from there. This time its not Jason Bourne that's the protagonist but another by the name of Aaron Cross.When news first came that this movie would be a stand-alone of the franchise, I thought this would be better rather than continuing Jason Bourne's story. Despite this, this installment does not live up to the standard of the previous movies. Even though the setting of the movie is good, the storyline isn't as great as the previous movies. The hand-held camera technique which made the previous movies more gripping and realistic is absent. They put a bit too much humour in the movie which undermined the gritty tone of the series. Another major flaw was that the movie ended abruptly giving the impression that the story will continue with another movie. This goes to show that the franchise is now on the road to running its course, their intention was to continue the story rather than make a stand-alone movie, and that Hollywood is now running out of ideas if you also consider this year's reboot of Spider-Man and the remake of Total Recall (which I haven't seen yet).It is a worthwhile movie, just don't expect the same standard as the previous Bourne movies.",7,1,4,15 August 2012
1917," Very well made, just not one of the best.
","We've had so many World War 2 movies but hardly any World War 1 movies. The last one I can think of is Wonder Woman but that wasn't an official World War 1 move. But now we've finally got one in the form of 1917.The story itself is decent although you could argue its not one of the best. But the way it is captured is what makes this movie a very good one.The single shot take works very well. It makes the journey throughout the movie more realistic and making it look like its in real time. The movie also had a lot of intense moments which worked better with the single shot technique.The movie deserves more credit for its cinematography, intensity and realism rather than the story and the history behind it. That was what made it a very good movie but just not one of the best. Having said that though, I do feel this is more in line with director Sam Mendes's forte compared to the James Bond movies. What he tried to do with Skyfall is achieved much better in 1917. Glad hes gone back to where his strengths are.",8,1,2,20 January 2020
The Dark Knight," Definitely worthwhile
","The Dark Knight has been the most eagerly awaited summer blockbuster of 2008. After the phenomenal success of Batman Begins, the announcement of a sequel has had Batman fans on the grip. Then the hype exponentially increased after Heath Ledger's untimely passing back in January. Now with the movie finally released it seems to have lived to the hype with all the great reviews and all the box office records being broken.I was rather astonished when the Dark Knight reached number 1 on the IMDb Top 250 list. To be honest this is not one of the best movies I have seen. Nevertheless it is still a great movie. There is a good storyline. There are some intense moments. Of course credit has to go to the late Heath Ledger for his role as the Joker. The ending also allowed way for a third movie to be made. I was however not that impressed with the action in the movie.It seems that The Dark Knight has done the job it has been expected to do and has created a landmark in movie history together with The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption and other classic movies.",9,8,17,17 August 2008
Where Eagles Dare," Why isn't this a classic?
","Where Eagles Dare is a World War 2 based action thriller where British secret agents are given a mission to infiltrate a Nazi castle and rescue a prisoner of war.I first heard about this movie via the Facebook group For Bond Fans Only where one member mentioned the movie stating that Richard Burton's performance would have qualified him for the role of James Bond. I myself became eager to see the movie and ordered it from Amazon for only £2.While the plot may seem thin when you first read the blurb on IMDb, it turns out to be much more complex than that with a few great twists. This in turn adds to the thrills of the movie which will get you gripped. The double act of Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood added star quality to the movie. The action sequences were also very exciting to watch and added extra spice to the movie.I must say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. This is not your typical World War 2 movie. In fact it was more than that. I don't understand why this movie is not well know. It should be considered a classic. I may consider watching other classic World War 2 movies after this such as The Dirty Dozen. My £2 spent was definitely worthwhile.",10,4,10,3 October 2016
The Dark Knight Rises," Meets the mark
","The Dark Knight Rises picks up eight years after the events of The Dark Knight, and this time around, Batman has to tackle Selina Kyle aka Catwoman, and Bane.The Dark Knight really set the bar high and this made me think that even though Christopher Nolan is at the helm, there was a chance that this movie could fail to meet the standard set by The Dark Knight. Another reason for my thinking is that anyone, even if they are very good at something, can trip up. Even acclaimed directors like Steven Spielberg don't get it right every time. This has been one of if not the most anticipated movies of the year. So here's the million dollar question: has it managed to match the standard of The Dark Knight? To give a very brief answer, yes.The storyline is a very good one spiced with good character background. Anne Hathaway does well in her role of Selina Kyle. Tom Hardy did a great job as the menacing Bane, although there are one or two occasions where you can't quite understand what he is saying. But this is probably the best role he has played alongside Bronson. There are also one or two satisfying action scenes but don't expect so much of that as this focuses much more on story and characters. The movie rounds off the trilogy well and it's a good thing Christopher Nolan decided to do that rather than leaving it open and potentially lose its track. It looks like my prediction of it not being able to match The Dark Knight has been proved wrong.A couple of months ago, I watched the 1989 Batman movie and I have to say that it looked pretty buffoonish if you compare to The Dark Knight trilogy. The main reason is that the new movies have a darker and more edgy tone. Christopher Nolan has taken a close-to-failure franchise to a whole new level that no one could possibly imagine and has gone on to become one of if not the greatest movie directors in this era. I still maintain that the best movies he did are Inception and The Prestige. Nevertheless he deserves credit for putting Batman back on the movie map and more. I look forward to what he has to offer with next year's Man of Steel and beyond.",9,5,11,22 July 2012
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Not as good as Man of Steel but still worthwhile
","Before this movie had started filming there was some negativity over some of the casting choices, more notably Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. But as time went on, there was considerable hype over the movie. Then the negative reviews came along. Now I don't trust the critics so I just went along and saw the movie.The storyline was OK although I have to say it was quite slow and took some time for it to add up. I didn't mind Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne. Jesse Eisenberg tried to make the role of Lex Luthor his own but it didn't quite work. In fact his portrayal of Lex Luthor wasn't really like that in the previous movies. A couple of the action sequences were fun to watch and some of the special effects were nice. I watched the movie in IMAX which did make it that exciting.Overall I thought it was a good, enjoyable and worthwhile movie but I didn't enjoy it as much as Man of Steel. Some of the elements that made me enjoy the movie were there but not to the extent of Man of Steel. In terms of superhero vs superhero movies, I hope Captain America 3 can improve on that.",7,2,5,29 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Was the hype justified?
","I believe it was 3 years ago when the announcement came that Disney bought the rights to Star Wars and announced that they were making a new trilogy of movies. When I heard this, my thoughts were 'this is a joke'. I continued to hold that thought over that period of time and the hype surrounding the movie was unfathomable. I honestly did not see how it would be possible to continue after the events of Return of the Jedi.Nevertheless I thought I would still watch the movie. To my surprise I actually liked it. They were actually able to come up with a decent story to continue. They also introduced new characters and made them the main characters rather than put the focus on the recurring characters which I thought was a good idea. I also liked the background of the characters. It did leave one or two unanswered questions which hopefully will be answered in the later movies. I liked J.J. Abrams's movies and once again he has delivered.I'm still not quite sure if the hype is justified though. There have been a number of occasions when a movie has been bigged up, I end up going in and thinking it wasn't as great as people thought it was. In this case, however, my expectations were lowered. I can only hope that the other two movies to be released keeps up the standard.",8,3,21,3 January 2016
Pineapple Express," Pure fun from start to finish
","Now normally I'm not a big fan of comedies. But this one was just in a league of its own.The movie centers around a pair of junkies who go on the run when one of them witnesses a murder and they both end up getting into so much trouble as people start to chase them down.This had plenty of humour to keep you entertained throughout. There is also a decent amount of thrills, some violence, and one or two action sequences.This movie had plenty to entertain me and others. One of the more decent comedies I have seen in a while!",9,2,6,24 October 2008
Spectre," Got what I wanted - really liked it
","I have been a fan of the James Bond movies since I was a teenager. Three years ago when the franchise celebrated its golden anniversary I was really looking forward to Skyfall. When the movie came out, it split opinion. Although I thought the movie was good, I was a bit underwhelmed by it. It was quite slow, the plot borrowed from other movies and a lot of the action sequences were too brief. I felt Sam Mendes was partly to blame because he is an artistic director, not a mainstream one and not the right person to direct a Bond movie. So I was disappointed to hear later on that Sam Mendes will be directing this Bond movie as well. Nevertheless my excitement was still high. Then the movie was released and once again, having read all of the comments here on IMDb, it has split opinion. I was getting worried about how this movie would be like following my views on Skyfall. This evening I watched the movie in IMAX and I'm glad to say that I really like it.First of all the gun-barrel sequence is back where it should be: at the beginning of the movie. I know a lot of people don't like Sam Smith's 'Writing's On The Wall' for the theme song but I absolutely love it. I can't tell you how many times I've listened to it now. The song also accompanies an always visually exciting opening credits sequence. The storyline was a better one than in Skyfall and also incorporated characters into it by exploring the backgrounds of Bond and the villain. Other regulars, M, Q and Moneypenny are utilised more. I'm also glad to say that the action sequences are considerably better than in Skyfall, and when I say better I mean longer. Christoph Waltz did a decent job as the villain playing it cool and cerebral. There were also great captures of the sceneries, a couple of thrills, links to Craig's previous Bond movies and good humour as well.I will admit there are a couple of flaws with this movie. I know a lot of people have complained that it takes things from other movies. Well, yes it does but the references to other movies aren't as bad as in Skyfall. Others have said that parts of the score was the same as in Skyfall. I did also feel that there were some parts in the movie where score should have been used. Also some more substance about the organisation would've been nice.Overall my wait and excitement had paid off. I thought this was a great movie. It was better than Skyfall and I do feel that Sam Mendes has improved although I'm still not sure if he should direct Bond again.A Bond fan is left satisfied.",9,9,27,4 November 2015
The Island," A brilliant action sci-fi movie
",Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are both beings kept in a facility. They soon discover that they are clones being used as supplies of bodily parts for their human counterparts. Upon discovering this they escape from the facility and are on the run.This is a brilliant movie for a number of reasons. The storyline is great. The action sequences are magnificent. The same can also be said for the special effects. There is also very good depth into the characters of the film.Michael Bay is one of my favourite directors and one of the best action directors around. Many people actually hate him but what they don't realise is that he directs enjoyable action movies and not Oscar winning dramas.What a shame that such a great blockbuster had to fail at the box office.,10,1,2,14 August 2008
