It," A horror movie that hits the heart
","Other horror movies scare you. This one tells you not to be afraid.

The Godfather: Part II," A surprise sequel
","The story is quite good. The comparison between the two lines for two generations, one for entrepreneurship and one for success, is really enough to make people feel very emotional. Vito, who grew up without a father and a mother, was finally reunited and happy, and Mike, who grew up in the warmth of the family, was more selfish until he was rebellious.

Aladdin," A gorgeous song and dance film
","After the king of the circus, the only song and dance feast that made me want to brush on the spot. The classic tracks in the cartoons have been re-interpreted, and new music has been added, and there is a seamless dance, which is perfect. But I know that the score will not be too high. In addition to people who like Disney and like song and dance films, it is estimated that the audience will not be too much. For example, the little girl next to me will be indifferent to the whole process because she can't understand or like this type of music. But for me, this is a perfect work, both childhood memories, but also a fresh feeling. No matter how many points you score, I have a perfect score here.",7,0,0,19 May 2020

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," My childhood memories

Wonder Woman," Great movie
","The best way to create a fantasy theme is to provide a special perspective on fantasy, in order to re-examine the human race itself. Although Diana is Superman, the director did not use 'Superman Logic' to keep it away from the audience. Instead, she was shaped as a 'person' who did not know the world, focusing on the conflict of values, which is a height that other hero films can't match",8,3,12,9 June 2020
