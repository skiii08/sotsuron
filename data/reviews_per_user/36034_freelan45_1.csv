Walk the Line," Oh... my... Goodness...
","Oh... my... Goodness...This movie totally blew me away! First of all, I am a huge Johnny Cash fan, so I had high expectations in the first place when I went to see it, and both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon blew me away in their performances.Reese Witherspoon reminded me a whole lot of June Carter - it was just like she was alive, God bless her soul, standing in my TV and singing and performing like only she knew how.But the award for actor of the movie definitely goes to Joaquin Phoenix in his portrayal of the Man in Black, Johnny Cash. As I watched this movie, and as I watched Joaquin perform, I was seeing and feeling Johnny Cash - no matter what his actions were.This is one of my favorite movies of the year, and it is definitely one of my favorite biopic movies. All of the other performers didn't miss one second, but it was definitely a movie that Joaquin and Reese made good.Props to all.Highly recommended.",10,0,1,28 December 2005
