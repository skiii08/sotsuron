The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Slow, boring with poor acting
","Let me say it right now; I hated this movie. It was bad. Look, the concept of a film being cut into two parts just does not work. The whole thing felt like a two-hour exposition. The first 30 minutes were so damn boring I literally could not stop getting out of focus and moving uncomfortably in my seat. There really isn't anything special going on as it progresses, too. There is war going on, but they do not really show it and it doesn't suck you in. It's very slow paced with lots of teenage drama and not a lot of 'games' or 'hunger' as in the previous films (which I liked, by the way). And now there's Jennifer Lawrence's acting, which was trying too hard (while making lots of weird facial expressions that made me laugh at inappropriate moments). Overall, I think the idea of splitting a movie into two parts; thus making the first half boring, isn't a very good one. And in this case 'not very good' is a compliment. 3/10",3,456,739,20 November 2014
