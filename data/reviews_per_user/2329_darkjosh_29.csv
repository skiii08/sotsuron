The Blair Witch Project," Groundbreaking horror film that was done-in by overhyping
","The Blair Witch Project is an inventive, often genuinely terrifying, and overall very effective documentary-like horror film about a group of student filmmakers who venture into the woods to explore the legend of the Blair Witch, which tells the story of a witch who lured children into her home and killed them.So, how does Blair Witch, a film with a very meager budget and a cast of three unknowns succeed in delivering a scarefest? It very skillfully uses the documentary feel, its amateur camerawork, and its sense of reality to plunge the viewer into its deep, dank woods.  The audience doesn't feel as if they're watching another contrived slasher flick that's been churned out by some Hollywood gore factory to bring in profits: instead, what we feel is genuineness, reality, and uncertainty as the three students' sanity unravels in the depths of the unknown.Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams all do exceptional jobs of showing their terror onscreen, especially during the nightly ritualistic assaults around their campground.  Donahue, however, is the best of the group, and her final apology certainly makes chills run up and down your spine when she breathes, 'I'm scared to close my eyes. I'm scared to open them.'  Blair Witch accomplishes a feat that has become almost extinct in horror films: it makes us care about its characters and also offers some truly terrifying moments. When first released, there was so much hype regarding the fact that it was extremely unnerving and very scary - appetites whetted, audiences were expecting to see something totally mind-blowing, utterly terrifying, and completely overwhelming, but ultimately familiar horror film. They weren't prepared to never see any onscreen presence of evil, and when the film came to a close, many complained about its abruptness and what they viewed as an ultimately eventless, 'boring' movie.Blair Witch, however, is a thoroughly original, effective psychological mind trip that plays on the greatest fear we all have: the fear of the unknown. With little gore and no onscreen presence of the 'monster', we feel more of The Blair Witch Project than we watch it.9 out of 10",9,1,2,31 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Easily the Least Inspired, Worst Film in the Series
","Phantom Menace contains none of the charm or spark of its predecessors, instead using special effects to hide its lack of substance.It seems that recently, all big-budget action-fantasy movies are SO obsessed with giving the audience an eyeful of jaw-dropping special effects that they forget to give audiences things to ponder.  Such is the case with Phantom Menace: it is more interested in making extravagant use of special effects technology than providing a tight, well-written, script that is equal to the previous three films.This film obviously caters more to children with its carnival-esque atmosphere than the other Star Wars did.  I would rather see Luke talking to an animatronic Yoda in the damp, foggy, mystical forest world than see Jar Jar Binks making a complete ass of himself in a CGI-created underwater world.  The contrast between this and the rest of the series is so great that one could easily skip this film and just wish for something much more concrete in the next installment.The performances here are not at all impressive or heartfelt; characters are thinly-scripted, and spew one-liners.  Big name stars are placed in miniscule roles, yet they don't add anything to the story; in fact, they seem to be there to distract from its flimsiness.  Example: 'Oooh, look, it's Samuel Jackson,' in a scene that could have easily been deleted from the film.If you're looking for a fun fantasy ride full of eye-popping visuals and clean, wholesome family fun, you could do a lot worse than Phantom Menace. Die-hard Star Wars fans will certainly be disappointed with what seems more like an insult than a prequel to the rest of this awesome, pioneering series.5 out of 10",5,0,1,14 September 2000
Training Day," Searing Work From Washington and Fuqua
","Audiences looking for a big, mindless, action-driven cop flick in Training Day will be surprised by two things: director Antoine Fuqua, who made the dismally mediocre Jaime Foxx vehicle, 'Bait', has molded an adult, tense, mature, and engrossing action-drama, and two, Denzel Washington has eschewed his good guy persona, playing a charismatic but unlikable rogue cop.While the story of corrupt cops lurking in the police department may be done to death, a certain timeliness is present with such stories as the recent LAPD Rampart scandal.  Ethan Hawke plays a rookie-cop who hopes to work his way up the rungs of the LAPD to detective by working with seasoned undercover narcotics cop Washington.  Washington proves, however, to have questionable methods of investigation and procedure.  Hawke unwittingly is drawn into the sickly logical and charasmatic musings of Washington until he ends up unwittingly becoming a participant in a coverup.Again, the story has been done before, but rarely has it been tackled with such a tense, uneasy, and guttural realism.  Director Antoine Fuqua injects the film with a searing authenticity: LA hasn't been such an uninviting. dangerous, ugly urban jungle in a while, with bleak, rainy shots of the city swimming in dirt, litter, and graffiti. The use of realistic looking and acting gang members, and also the cameo appearances of rap stars helps keep tensions high as well, and also adds striking resonance.
Anchoring the whole movie is Denzel Washington, in a refreshing change from his usual upstanding, righteous roles.  As the corrupt cop, he gleefully goes for broke in a manic, antihero, larger-than-life performance so unlike his previous work that it will surely garner him an Oscar nomination.
While the last 15 minutes almost undo the fantastic work by the cast and crew, Training Day is an accomplished renewal in the cop movie genre, a promising feature in Fuqua's career, and another great performance under Denzel Washington's belt.8 out of 10",8,1,11,17 October 2001
The Big Lebowski," Can A Film With Bowling In It Be This Hilarious?
","The Coen brothers prove their aptness at creating quirky, wonderfully engaging, and often hilarious characters as well as snappy dialogue between them.  The Big Lebowski is a well-written, off-beat comedy filled with gut-busting scenes of absurdity and charm.The Big Lebowski stars Jeff Bridges as Lebowski, or as he prefers to be called, 'The Dude.'  When he is mistaken as another Lebowski (millionaire Lebowski), he stumbles into a kidnapping, ransom, money-laundering plot between millionaire Lebowski and a group of Nihilists.  In between this, he takes the time to go bowling with buddies John Goodman and Steve Buscemi.Jeff Bridges' hilarious Dude is a wonderful amalgam of laziness and low-key wit.  His performance is marvelously engaging and entertaining with Bridges making his character slovenly, meandering, but ultimately an all-around nice guy.  John Goodman gives one of his best comedic performances to date as the Dude's whacked out, extremist, Jewish 'Nam buddy.  He and Steve Buscemi's harsh scenes create a caustic and very funny chemistry.The dream sequences are in a class by themselves - they are probably the oddest ever filmed, with Bridges getting caught in a bowling ball, a bowling ball's eye view, and an unusually militant worker at the local bowling alley.  At the very least, they will put a smile on your face.With it's quirky, off-beat characters, Jeff Bridge's brilliant comic creation that is The Dude, and a wonderfully funny supporting cast, The Big Lebowski is one of the best comedies of all time.  While the plot may not be at the same level of the Coens' other masterpiece, Fargo, it's still very enjoyable fun. After all, who would have taught a film with bowling as a backdrop could be so fun? 9 out of 10",9,0,0,4 November 2000
Unbreakable," Unbreakable Breaks Fresh Ground
","M. Night Shaymalan's follow up to his masterful Sixth Sense may not be as tightly-wound, but it's still certainly a fresh, innovative, mysterious thriller with what seems to be becoming the director's trademark: a fantastic ending.When Bruce Willis (in a somewhat muted performance) is in a disastrous trainwreck, he is the sole survivor and is tracked down by Samuel L. Jackson, whom suspects he might know why Willis survived unscathed.Shaymalan directs with the same eerie restraint he incorporated so well in Sixth Sense, and sometimes the silent stretches that have no dialogue overshadow the regular scenes.  Bruce Willis' quiet performance is contrasted by Samuel L. Jackson's decidedly determined, obsessed character, the same way Willis' deadpan doctor in Sixth Sense was overcome by Haley Joel Osment's intense supernatural child.Also, Shaymalan does not forget to make us sympathize with his characters plights.  Willis' scenes of emotional estrangement from both his son and daughter and the small splashes of intermitten bonding are deeply heartfelt. The same goes for Jackson's scenes with his mother which evoke sympathy. 
Unbreakable's cinematography is also effective, serving the workings of the script, framing each shot as if it were in a box.  While the film has an overcast look to it, there are scenes lit beautifully to contrast the overall grey blandness.With Unbreakable, M. Night Shaymalan proves that his masterful handling of Sixth Sense was not a fluke.  Great storytelling, good performances, and a mysterious setting peppered with some affecting though small bits of comedy all come together in a wholly original, involving thriller.8 out of 10",9,1,1,29 November 2000
Memento," Unforgettable
","Guy Pearce is a showcase of paranoia and confusion in Memento, director Christopher Nolan's dizzying onscreen jigsaw puzzle that plunges the audience into a mesmerizing web of intrigue, obsession, and deceit.Memento is a film noir that offers a strikingly original premise.  Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, an ex-insurance investigator whose wife was murdered while he lay unconscious from a head injury.  The injury, as it turns out, is catastrophic: he can no longer form new memories and only remembers everything before the attack.  The story makes for a bevy of confusion as the viewer frantically tries to size up each character, along with Pearce attempting to do the same.To say more of the plot would be doing the film a disservice.  It's a rare cinematic experience where you actually struggle with a character and question everything that you've just seen.  Engrossing from its beginning, it never fails to stun in its complexity - not only running itself backwards (we begin the movie at the end and work backwards to a jolting, brilliant beginning) - but also including flashbacks and a separate scene in which Pearce explains his condition, both running tantamount with the main story. Nolan has crafted a unique cerebral teaser in Memento that asks the viewer to partake in the chaotic madness and continues to haunt and ask questions after its brilliant finale, not only about what has just happened onscreen but also questions the concept of memory and what we choose to believe has happened in the past even if our memory isn't totally clear.Technically, the film stays true to the film noir genre: desolate, bleak, dark, and colorless.  The cinematography is handled with jagged splicing and the visual style employed is central conveying the jumbled, boggled mind of Pearce's character.  We think we see things, clues are embedded in split second frames assailed at the viewer in bursts of haze.Guy Pearce gives us his best performance in Shelby, seamlessly getting lost in the profundity of his character's obsessive-compulsive pit.  His quiet, understated performance is tragic, heartfelt, entrancing, menacing, and fascinating in his calculating coldness and tender remembrances.  Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano both turn in twisted and wonderfully ambiguous performances as people involved in Pearce's quest for revenge. Surprisingly, we never see the pair onscreen even though the two supporting actors previously worked on The Matrix.In a time where CGI and special effects seem to be ruling in theaters, Memento reminds us what truly makes a fantastic and truly memorable cinematic experience: innovative storytelling and interesting, sympathetic characters.  We needn't see explosions to be entertained, or cars chasing each other at ridiculous speeds, or extraneous gunplay.  Not only does the masterpiece that is  Memento manage to pull out the rug from its audience and be incredibly intelligent, it manages to raise questions where other films might simply be content to provide two hours of mindless diversion. Memento is anything but mindless and will have you guessing hours after the credits have rolled and is one of the year's best films.10 out 10",10,0,1,24 April 2001
12 Monkeys," Gilliam's Masterpiece of Madness
","Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus destroying all but a handful of people across the Earth and forcing them to move underground and the man sent back in time to gather information about it is a fantastic, dizzying, and highly stylized film that boasts Bruce Willis' best performance ever.What sets 12 Monkeys apart from most time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis character actually deals with what the psychological effects of time-travel, that is, not knowing what reality is actual reality: the place that the time-traveler comes from or goes to.  Also, the film recognizes that things that have past cannot be altered and that the prevention of a cataclysmic event, in this case the release of said virus, cannot be stopped or changed.  As Willis asserts 'It's already happened,' while he's in a mental hospital, the major dilemma the film trudges into is not a trite, overdone plot to save the world; instead it's Willis' inner struggle to simply survive himself.  It's a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully thanks to a tautly written script by Peoples and Gilliam's unique brand of dementia.Besides this, 12 Monkey's storytelling is totally non-linear and instead opts to distort and bend the way the story is told skillfully incorporating a bevy of different time sequences: flashbacks, dreams, memories, the present, the past, the future, and even a scene that is lifted out of Hitchcock's Vertigo.  All serve to envelop the viewer into its disturbing cacophony of madness and futility.Visually, Gilliam is a master of desolate umbrage and shadow rivalling Tim Burton in his strikingly despondent scenery and imagery.  With cold, wide, and immersing cinematography, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings and darkness of his characters.  The scenes are often bathed in a strangely antiseptic, dead white and help serve as a contrast to the often veering-on-madness characters.Performance-wise, Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination.  As mentioned, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero and instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman.   Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis' psychologist.  She holds her own, injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false 'religion.'Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape.  Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with bravura performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a masterpiece of madness.  Ranking in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a darkly lavish spectacle of a film brimming with brilliance.10 out of 10",10,633,687,29 November 2000
Batman Returns," Dark, Gritty, Grandiose, and Entertaining
","If Batman was a dark, hellish nightmare, Batman Returns' has been lowered even further into the darkness in Tim Burton's fantastic follow up to his 1989 hit.Micheal Keaton reprises his role as the Caped Crusader, and as was the case in the first film, does a subtle and effective job of portraying Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The real treat, however, is the new villains that he's gained.  The Penguin, amusingly played by DeVito is wickedly fun; Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman is a sly, slinky, and intoxicatingly seductive; and Christopher Walken's Max Shreck is a ruthless, tough, and backstabbing businessman.  While Batman is the hero, he is completely overshadowed by the fun menace provided by the three villains.Gotham City is even bleaker than before; with wrought iron fencing, soft snowfall and greys, whites, and blacks permeating the entire film.  The set design is beautifully gothic and depressing.  The look of the film is nightmarish and dull; Tim Burton would not direct anything so absent of color until Sleepy Hollow, 7 years later.  Danny Elfman's music is also effective with its subtle, tinny, and foreboding score.While the story is not as compelling as its prequel's was, Batman certainly offers a fun script and great visuals: the attack during the Christmas parade, faithful penguin servants, a cavalcade of circus thugs, and, again, a dark vision of the fair city of Gotham.  The film will satisfy any Burton fan and will definitely ring faithfully true to Batman fans.8 out of 10",8,0,0,30 August 2000
The Mummy," Bury This Mummy Again
","What could have been a fun, original, and roller-coaster ride reworking of the classic titular monster, instead turns out to be a long, effects-laden, mostly plodding kid's film, complete with the obligatory jokes only a 10-year old could laugh at.Brendan Fraser certainly brings a welcome vigor to this lifeless movie, that is a purely special-effects driven rehash of the Universal classic.  Sure, there are lots of great visuals here, the primary glory of the film being the CGI mummy, but ultimately this movie seems to fall into the same trap as Godzilla did: damn the script, full-throttle the effects.There are no real thrills here, either: most of the action sequences are cliched, uninspired, and just plain mindless.  There could have been tons of ways to make 'The Mummy' at the very least be heralded at least as a kinetic thrill-ride, but you sure won't find any intensity here.Overall, 'The Mummy' is pure silliness that will no doubt have kids entranced and yourself in a trance and becoming like a mummy; that is, getting a lot of shut-eye.4 out of 10",4,0,1,13 September 2000
The Others," Intelligent, Atmospheric Horror
","It's almost impossible to discuss The Others without bringing up 1999's already classic ghost thriller The Sixth Sense.  Both are films that move deliberately slow, drawing in the audience with a fine eye for details and no special effects, creating a brooding atmosphere and getting frights from suggestion and small effects.  Still, Amenabar's The Others goes even further with his minimalist style, constructing a film that becomes increasingly creepy with the slightest sound effect or plot point.Nicole Kidman, in a bravura, chilling performance, stars as Grace, mother to two children with a rare disease that makes exposure to sunlight deadly. She lives in a mansion on an island, fog smothering their secluded existence, when one day three servants come looking for work. She hires them, and suddenly strange noises and occurences start descending on the house. Slowly, it becomes evident that they are not alone when her daughter begins to describe her experiences with a mysterious ghost boy named Victor.The Others is an elegantly mounted film, and Amenabar succeeds in building an uneasy tension with striking cinematography that makes the light and darkness seem to come alive, as if it were a character in itself.  At times, the look and feel of it seems more like a macabre Merchant-Ivory production than a haunted house movie. Amenabar's pacing is perfect; it's refreshing to see a summer movie that slowly and confidently ups the ante to the point where the audience doesn't know where the story is going to go. When the film finally reaches it's end, its quite a spine-tingling climax.8 out of 10",8,0,0,7 October 2001
Chicken Run," Inventive Tale of Poultry Freedom
","Call it Braveheart for poultry, Chicken run is a sweet, goodnatured, nicely-crafted family film about a group of chickens on a Yorkshire farm in the 1950s who dream of freedom beyond the fences.  They are headed by spirited hen Ginger, who organizes and rallies her fellow fowl in various failed attempts to escape.  Then one night, Rocky Rhodes, a flying rooster, ends up hiding in a chicken coop and promising to teach them how to fly out of the farm.While the entire thing may sound like a film driven purely at kids, it's surprisingly charming and intelligent, using its English setting to its advantage, creating a group of disarmingly funny and cute, memorable characters that adults can also enjoy.  The voiceovers are off-beat and often hilarious, except for Mel Gibson, whose harsh, gratingly annoying voice seems totally out-of-place as the asinine American rooster.  Perhaps if a different actor would have been used, the character would see much more likeable.The claymation in the film is flawless, and the enlarged eyes and overall pudgy look of the hens is very adorable, and a thrilling ride inspired by Indiana Jones through a chicken pot pie machine.  All the characters look as if they were delicately, lovingly created and are treated as such.A truly imaginative animation movie, Chicken Run is fun fare that both kids and families can enjoy.8 out of 10",8,0,0,7 December 2000
Insomnia," More Great Work From Nolan; Masterful Work From Pacino
","Al Pacino has always been known and rewarded for his loud, showy, abrasive, and larger-than-life characters.  He's garnered Oscar nominations for big, in-your-face roles such as in Dick Tracy and The Godfather, and finally won for Scent of a Woman, in which his gargantuan, wild performance literally carried an otherwise average film.  That's why it's such a shock and treat to see him playing the lead character, Detective Will Dormer, in Insomnia as a man so lost and broken in spirit that you can see the failure, defeat, and exhaustion on his face.  This isn't a variation of his shouting, impassioned, bordering-on-caricature personas; it's a performance of subtlety and depth as he slowly becomes bogged down by both guilt and lack of sleep.  In short, it may be Pacino's best performance of his career.L. A. detectives Will Dormer and partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) arrive in the small Alaskan town of Nightmute (sumptuously photographed) to assist local police in the murder of a young girl. The town is in the middle of a 6-month period of constant twilight, with the sun never going down and light pervading all, adding to Dormer's sleeplessness. Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank, in a perfunctory role), a rookie cop, serves as their guide and helps with the investigation.  Dormer and Eckhart are in conflict; Eckhart threaten sto give information to the LAPD about misconduct on Dormer's part.  During a chase for the killer, Dormer accidentally shoots his partner.  The killer sees this, and uses it to blackmail him into helping him flee police capture.At the midway point, the murderer is revealed, and is played by Robin Williams.  Again, here is a performer known for his energetic and spontaneous work in a variety of comedy and family films.  Under Nolan's direction, Williams turns in a creepy cool performace, underplaying his role and imbuing the character with an intangible, offbeat quality.  With the two main performers doing such quality work, it's sad that Hillary Swanks' role was not more fleshed out.  Her job is too basically be in peril when the script calls for it or act suspicious.  It's not so much that it's a poorly written character, it's just that  a great performer deserves a great role.Director Christopher Nolan has directed another fine thriller with Insomnia. Of course its much more conventional than Memento, but that's to be expected and really can't be held against a top-notch mindgame such as this. He gets fantastic performances out of his cast, especially Pacino with his masterful onscreen deterioration of his character. A well-paced and engrossing film, with just the right amount of action and  a fascinating and thoughtful psychological dance between the two main characters. Nolan is filling the niche he carved himself in the suspense genre with more quality work.8 out of 10",8,0,0,29 May 2002
Fargo," Brilliant, Seemingly-Simplistic Film
","Fargo is a wonderfully unusual, extremely well scripted crime film that crackles with strongly developed, yet very off-beat characters, sporadic violence, splashes of dark comedy, and an outstanding ensemble supporting cast.When Jerry Lundergaard (the marvelous William Macy) schemes to have his wife kidnapped by criminals Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare so that he can collect the ransom money from his wealthy father-in-law, everything is planned and set to go smoothly.  But this, being a Coen brothers film, nothing goes as planned and eventually everything goes downhill.  That's when Officer Marge Gunderson (the quirky Frances McDormand) begins her investigation of the 'malfesance.'Fargo's greatest attribute is the dead-on, masterful performances of its cast, and not one of them misses their mark.  The standout, however, is William Macy, as the none-too-bright husband whose scheme goes terribly awry.  Macy perfectly embodies the inept Lundergaard and portrays his frustration wonderfully with such lines as 'the heckdy'a mean?'  Even after his plans take a turn for the absolute worst, we sympathize with his plight. His scene with his son is such a squirm-inducing one, that for a minute we find him both despicable and we sympathize.  Frances McDormand also shines in her Oscar-winning role as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant, determined, quirky, and optimistic detective assigned to unravel this mystery. Buscemi and Stormare are also dead on as the kidnappers : Stormare's dry, mute performance complements the loud, abrasive performance by Buscemi.The scenery is also appropriately bleak and desolate, with the whiteness and dreariness of snow pervading all, from it's opening shot of a single car materializing out of the white of snowfall.  It's interesting to see how the Coens have contrasted the bleakness of the area with the colorfulness of it's inhabitants: all seem to be perky, polite, and ever-so-nice.The script is also well-written, with some very original, inventive scenes, such as Macy's car sale to an irate customer, an abrupt car chase in the stinging coldness of Brainerd, and a very colorful conversation with a local regarding some suspicious 'lookin fellas.'  The dialogue is also quite funny at points, and effectively terse at others.Fargo is a film that is a crime film that is engaging without any of the normal elements found in the genre: it has no long, dangerous car chases, no grandiose shootouts, and of course, it has no cliched, stale villains or heroes.  It's power lies in its uniqueness, both in its complex story and its down-to-earth, credible, engaging characters, and of course the concrete, dazzling performances turned it by the entire cast.  Fargo is a winner, and is it destined to be a classic? In the words of McDormand, 'Oh, ya.'9 out of 10",9,0,0,5 November 2000
Cast Away," Flawed But Insightful Journey Into Loneliness
","Cast Away is Tom Hank's latest Oscar-hopeful performance, but rest assured, a nomination will not be garnered.  Though the film is at its best when Hanks is in the drudges of loneliness, it fails to convince us of Hank's relationship with co-star Helen Hunt.  Though their scenes together are few, it certainly detracts from the mood set throughout the film.Cast Away begins by showing us Tom Hank's character as a man obsessed with time: he has to be, since he works for Federal Express.  After saying goodbye to his wife (Helen Hunt, in a flat, one-note performance), he is in a plane crash that leaves the others dead and himself stranded on an island.Time apart from loved ones and friends is an essential theme to Cast Away, that is, time should not be wasted - during his ordeal on the island, the pain Hanks feels is not for the loss of food, shelter, or material possessions.  His inspiration for survival is the love of his life, Helen Hunt.  During his stay on the island, his need for a companion grows to the point where he takes to talking to a volleyball.  In fact, the most emotionally stirring scene takes place between he and the volleyball and not the ones with Helen Hunt: when sports equipment makes a greater impression with the audience than a top actress, there's something quite wrong.Tom Hanks' performance as Chuck Noland may not be Oscar material, but it certainly is well-done, and the  long stretches and scenes without much dialogue are enlivened by some funny instances and Robert Zemeckis ironically lush photography of the paradise-like island turned prison for Hanks..  There's also quite a few touches of irony in the film, and also inventiveness that comes in the way of Hank's novel uses of some of the FedEx packages that wash ashore with him.For all the buzz that's been generated by this Hanks/Zemeckis project, the film lives up to it in the beginning and middle - but the end feels like it was hastily put together - the scenes between Hunt and Hanks feel contrived, the dialogue is flat, and they have zero chemistry.  If only the film had ended 20 minutes sooner, the solitude and meaning of the film would have gained fantastic strength and momentum; unfortunately, it's undone by a rather banal ending.",7,0,0,27 December 2000
Pitch Black," Slow Action, Mindless Sci-Fi
","Pitch Black can't decide what it wants to be: an intriguing, smart sci-fi film or a fun, relentless action flick.  It tries to too little to be both and fails to be either.When a spaceship carrying dangerous criminal Diesel crash lands on three-sunned, desolate planet, the crew attempts to find a way off. However, they discover the seemingly-lifeless planet is inhabited by vicious, deadly, nocturnal creatures, and they have unluckily landed in time for a total eclipse.The story has promise, since we expect the crew of misfits will band together and try to fend off the aliens in a hugely exciting way.  Instead, what we get is a film that plods along for half of its way with bantering, lame dialogue, unappealing characters and long, stretched out pointless conversations about planning and gathering supplies.  We are also introduced to the crew of the ship, all one-dimensional characters who we could care less about.  Just for the heck of it, we also see children in danger.Director by David Twohy, Pitch Black could have benefited from more chaotic, gripping scenes of the crew attempting to survive the hideous, stealthy beasts.  Instead, he tries to make the film brainy and it fails miserably. We are treated to excruciatingly dull dialogue interspersed with long pauses, outbursts of profanity, and gore aplenty.  Vin Diesel, the only actor amongst the sun-bleached cast, is the only one who comes off as somewhat intriguing and appealing, but it's mostly because of his physical attributes.  The special effects also fall curiously flat, with the aliens coming off as cartoons.Pitch Black could have been a wild, thrilling, even scary movie if Twohy had decided to make the dialogue terse, added more action sequences, or given the characterizations more weight. Instead, the film decides to plod along, falling prey to the Hamlet syndrome: that is, thinking too much and not doing anything.3 out of 10",3,0,1,11 November 2000
Liar Liar," Likeable Carrey Vehicle Bogged Down by Schmaltz
","Liar Liar, Jim Carrey's return to comedy that made him a star (after audiences failed to appreciate his bitingly dark turn in 1996's The Cable Guy) finds him as a habitual liar/lawyer whose son decides to wish his father can tell nothing but the truth for an entire day.Carrey, as usual, turns in an all-out, body-flailing, mugging, and excruciatingly hilarious performance.  His comedic timing is impeccable, his physical antics singularly unique, and he constantly proves to be an inventively outrageous comic actor.  We can sympathize with his inability to lie as well, as we realize that we all lie to some extent.With such a big focus and so much more attention put on Carrey's dilemma, however, the rest of the cast is overshadowed.  Maura Tierney and Carrey Elwes' relationship isn't really too believable and Carrey's relationship with son Justin Cooper really feels tacked on at times.  While the film is certainly more accessible to a much wider age-range than some other of Carrey's crude, ill-spirited brand of humor, the family-film element brings down this movie.  This obviously isn't a family type film, so why bog it down with such a subplot?  Jennifer Tilly, on the other hand, fares well in her thinly-scripted role.
Besides the sometimes schmaltzy familial moments, Liar Liar is a much more likeable, restrained second collaboration between Carrey and director Tom Shadyac.  Newcomers to Carrey's brand of comedy will be pleased, as he isn't out-and-out crude and is generally likeable; die-hard Carrey fans might ask why he's not out of control.  Overall, however, a very enjoyable, light-hearted comedy.7 out of 10",8,0,0,5 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Ferocious Fights, Distinctive Drama
","When a film immerses us in its surroundings and makes us feel as we have traveled to an exotic locale and been amongst its inhabitants, it succeeds in delivering quite a satisfying movie-going experience. Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, however, transcends the move-going experience and is something more of an experience in itself.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a deft mixture of Shakespearean drama and stunning swordplay: set in ancient China, Yun-Fat Chow stars as a former disciple of a powerful Wudan master, Wudan being a form of martial arts mythic and magical in its proportions. When he decides to retire the Green Destiny, a sword of unstoppable strength, and settle down with lifetime love Michelle Yeoh, someone steals the sword. At the same time, there's a love affair going on between a soon-to-be-wed-through-arrangement bride Ziyi Zhanga and her unaccepted true love.Crouching Tiger has some of the most show-stopping, stunning, and most fluidly photographed and choreographed fight sequences ever captured on film. Though often violent, the fights are something to behold and will surely have you in awe of their beauty, as actors gracefully fly through the air, run swiftly and effortlessly on rooftops, stand on flimsy, dangling tree limbs, and engage in cunning, kinetic swordfights. It's especially interesting that the most intense battles take place between women,Aside from the jaw-dropping action, Crouching Tiger also denies all Hollywood conventions: the villain in the film is a woman as well, and she is deadlier and exerts more control over her male counterparts. The action also centers around women, and they are no atypical movie creations: they are strong, stalwart, and equally if not more foreboding and intimidating than the male characters in the film. It's a fresh, thoroughly novel approach, especially in a film packed with so much force and action that a testosterone-fueled story is expected.Crouching Tiger is also surprisingly a lovingly crafted romance film with an underlying theme of breaking away from traditions: all the character want to break free of the mundane rituals they've had to follow all their lives or will have to follow. Chow Yun Fat tires of his seemingly endless thwarting of evil and years to live a peaceful life with Yeoh. Zhanga also wishes to break free of her arranged ties with her soon-to-be husband and live with her outlaw boyfriend. While the latter story may sound cliched, it's handled with such humor and warmth, it hardly seems anything but genuine thanks to the two younger actors.In Crouching Tiger, director Ang Lee has effectively meshed two genres that have been meshed tritely, messy, and unbelievably before by Hollywood hacks and has come up with a visionary tale of swordplay and romance. This film is not only entertaining and a landmark in the martial arts genre, it also almost makes up slew of disappointing films this year. With awe-inspiring action and a moving love story, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is easily one of the best films of the year.9 out of 10",9,0,0,29 December 2000
Mulholland Drive," Lynch's Mind-Spinning Masterpiece
","If you've never seen a David Lynch film, you've never seen the kind of disorienting and hypnotic power film can be capable of.  There's no other director like him, no other filmmaker who creates disquiet, illusion, and an uncomfortable atmosphere as he does.   In Mullholland Dr., Lynch's most complex work to date, he has fashioned all of the ideas that intrigued in Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and Lost Highway into a maddening, surrealistic, and dreamlike tapestry; the audience may or may not know what's happening, but  they are glued to the screen trying logically fit the pieces of the puzzle into an understandable fusion.I realize I've said nothing about the plot of the film, because its so labyrinthine and mind-boggling that it can't be described justifiably in a single review.  The basic storyline however, begins with an actress (Laura Harring) about to be killed by her drivers on Mulholland Dr when a speeding car collides with her limo, leaving her with amnesia.  At the same time, Betty (Watts), an aspiring actress oozing sweetness arrives in Los Angeles from Canada.  They meet at her apartment, and Betty attempts to help 'Rita' (a name she adopts from a movie poster) regain her identity.Lynch outdoes himself in such cryptic, confusing, sometimes hilarious, but most often odd scenes as a mafioso/film producer spews out his espresso while his partner inexplicably yells out, 'Help me! Help me!'a jealous director coats his cheating wife's jewelry in pink paint, and an evening excursion to a nightclub that climaxes with a heartbreaking rendition of a Roy Orbison song in Spanish.The first 2 hours or so of the movie seem conspicuously solvable, but t a point during all of the story shifts or unravels.  Identities change, some characters disappear, reappear, simply don't come back at all, or maybe become one.  The audience feels jerked around, manipulated, but intrigued by it all.  Logically, we want to know what is going on and try to put all of the pieces together.  There are so many pieces however, that it is nearly impossible to look at the proceedings in a logical sense.This film is not for those who want a straightforward story with a beginning, conflicts, heroes and villains that might as well have name tags on them, or resolutions with a neat and tidy ending.  They key to getting any kind of understanding is to simply let it flow through you the first time you watch it (multiple viewings are required, as with most Lynch films) and understand that much of it is dreamlike, so as with dreams, may have happened or may not have.  You may get it of you may not.  Regardless, it's a fascinating and recommendable journey that's been masterfully created by David Lynch.  9 out of 10",9,1,2,11 April 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Explosions, Chase Scenes, Exotic Girl, Amounting to Nothing *sigh*
","From the very start of M:I 2, it's very clear this is a John Woo movie. Movie, for film is not a proper word to describe this uninvolving, plodding, loud crash of cinematic debris.Not picking up where Mission Impossible left off, M:I 2 brings Tom Cruise back as IMF agent Ethan Hunt given an assignment by Anthony Hopkins (inexplicably placed in a small, perfunctory role) who must stop European baddie Dougray Scott and American CEO Brendan Gleeson from releasing a deadly virus.That's the extent of the story, and it's stretched out for an excruciating 2 hours of explosions, hilariously-bad dialogue, deadly-boring conversations, generic, one-dimensional characters, and of course, more explosions.  Tom Cruise's calculating, emotional Hunt has been replaced by an indestructible, slick, larger-than-life persona that in no way resembles the Ethan Hunt of the first film.  Before, he cared a great deal about his mission; now, he cares a great deal for danger and excitement, as clearly shown by the otherwise unnecessary, meant-to-blow-you-away rock climbing introduction.Not to say that John Woo isn't a gifted action director.  Face/Off is one of the most stunning, well-executed, fun action films ever done.  However, it doesn't take itself too seriously, as the performances from Cage and Travolta demonstrate by exuding devilish wit and mischief.  Mission Impossible 2, however, attempts to cover up its lack of story with seemingly intriguing scenes of a blood-letting virus (seen before in Outbreak and its countless ripoffs), exotic locales inhabited by criminals (scene in countless crime films), and of course, over-the-top action sequences which in themselves may be cool, but that's all they are.  They don't really help further the story, because by the middle of the film, the story has gotten as far as it will go.Screenwriter Robert Towne said his script was written according to action sequences dictated to him by director Woo, and it clearly shows. Mission:Impossible II is a collection of well-choreographed fight and grandiose action sequences, but that's it.  Paying no homage to either the intrigue, deception and constantly twisting episodes of the TV series or the first installment of the film series, Mission: Impossible II is a sequel reaching only for the green, assaulting viewers with image, hoping they will not notice its lack of substance.4 out of 10",4,0,0,7 November 2000
The Insider," Mann is a Master of the Character Film
","Upon seeing Russel Crowe's great performance in 'Gladiator,' I decided to check out his Oscar-nominated role in 'Insider.'  While his performance was subtle and convincing and definitely worthy of a nomination, I was more taken aback by Mann's directorial style and his fine attention to characters.'The Insider' is definitely not your standard thriller.  Events do not move the story along here as much as characters do.  Characters'internal conflicts, doubts, fears, and uncertainties are what drives and raises this film above the usual fare.It's Mann's novelisitc approach to the story that makes it such a refreshing change of pace.  He avoids almost all thriller cliches: there is no excessive profanity, no shootouts, no fistfights, no murders.  The result is a mesmerizing, totally involving, refreshing, and frighteningly realistic film.Russel Crowe's subtle, brooding, and humanistic portrayal of Dr. Wigand and the loss and forced change of his life and family bring a deep emotion to the film.  Wigand falling down a hill in his yard is one of the film's most unsettling scenes.  The rest of the ensemble cast also does well, but Crowe's haunting performance overshadows even veteran Al Pacino.Definitely not a conventional, over-the-top thriller, Mann's character tour-de-force is a welcome change to a genre that usually makes the viewer suspend belief.  'Insider' does not ask the viewer to believe the incredible; instead it makes the viewer understand the truth.9 out of 10",9,0,0,19 September 2000
The Mummy Returns," A Mindless Whirlwind of CGI
","Had it not been for my anger and annoyance with the constant use of computer graphics that often looked subpar and ridiculous, The Mummy Returns would have put me into a deep sleep for a couple thousand years.There are so many poor aspects of the film, but to start, I will not mention The Rock as a star.  That's because he has a 5-minute cameo (and 5 minutes is stretching it) in the beginning and then returns in the last 10 minutes of the movie as a CGI monstrosity that looks like the latest Gameboy WWF Raw! installment.  Trailers would have us believe he is a major part of the film, and he is: he will get lots of ignorant moviegoers to shell out the bucks.Mummy brings back the characters from the previous flick for more mindless action along with an annoying child.  They travel through Egypt and London attempting to stop the evil mummy Imhotep from taking over the world (I think) as well as the Scorpion King from attempting to do the same (I think).  Director Stephen Sommers is congratulated for giving us the first special-effects-ridden, mindnumbing, corny, deafening Hollywood monstrosities of the summer.   While Mummy Returns certainly contains more action than its predecessor, it also has the same corny one-liners, stupid, illogical characters, muted violence, and shameless visuals from the first. It forgets to do what a worthwhile movie does: give us a good story and memorable characters.  The Mummy Returns is not only the same clumsy retread that The Mummy was, it's also a testament to Hollywood's extraneous dependence on budget and CGI to characters and screenwriting.  And judging from the millions it'll rake in, it's also a sad commentary on audiences' intelligence.3 out of 10",3,0,0,7 May 2001
Mission: Impossible," Exciting and Surprisingly Intelligent
","Mission:Impossible is a tightly scripted, taut, very suspenseful update of the old TV series that not only proves to be intelligent, but also has some adrenaline-pumping action sequences.Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt, a member of the IMF whose team is killed in a bungled attempt to recover a list of the true identities of many secret agents.  When he meets with his agency, they suspect he is the culprit behind their killings and must flee to attempt to prove otherwise.Brian DePalma, a director known for providing involving, deeply rooted stories about conspiracies and ruthless factions, such as Scarface and Carlito's Way.  In a film that just screams for non-stop, mindless action sequences, shootouts, and explosions, DePalma instead delivers an involving, complex film with action sequences both quietly effective and amazingly intense, as well as a great performance from John Voight and a charming, likeable, and witty performance from Tom Cruise.  Danny Elfman's score is also effective in building tension throughout.While certainly not as breathtaking a thrill ride as other actioners, Mission:Impossible succeeds in delivering a satisfyingly complex, intriguing story and interesting, thoughtful, slick characters.  It may falter sometimes in implausability, but the engaging story allows the suspense of disbelief.  Thoroughly entertaining.8 out of 10",8,0,2,7 November 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Comical, Crackling Crime Yarn
","Tarantino's violent crime tale and character study is a fast-paced, lurid, and wonderfully wicked film about a group of criminals who converge to pull off a diamond heist that ultimately goes awry and causes them all to question who gave their schemes away.While all of Tarantino's characters are dishonest, morally-corrupt, criminals, they all show very different methods of handling their work, and all the actors do a fantastic job of presenting an array of seemingly similar characters and fleshes them out as individual, thoughtful, and sometimes sickly logical.  Steve Buscemi here steals the film as the extremely talkative, motor mouth Mr. Pink who initiates the idea of a conspiracy.  Harvey Keitel is also a formidable force as the too-sympathetic and trusting Mr. White.  The soundtrack is also something to rave about. The 70's music fits the film perfectly.Tarantino's script is sprinkled with some very amusing and well written dialogue as well - he literally transforms excessive cursing and obscene stories into operatic and poetic filth.  Also, the few action scenes reinforce the tension that builds up to the brilliant ending.
Reservoir Dogs is a throughly entertaining crime movie that doesn't take itself gravely seriously and presents a thrilling tale in a comical way. Reservoir Dogs is well-acted, well-scripted, and has a gritty feel that separates it from the glossy crime movies that spew from Hollywood.  With a cast of almost virtual unknowns and a dynamite script, Tarantino goes for the audience's throat and packs Reservoir Dogs with thrills and tension to spare.8 out of 10",8,1,3,18 October 2000
Psycho," Perkins Is Remarkable
","Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits.  Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath.  One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling.  He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).Perkin's fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein's classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre.",9,264,347,12 September 2000
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Not Kesey, But Still Well-Crafted
","Milos Forman's film may not be entirely true to Ken Kesey's novel, but it is still, in its own right, an inspiring, well-crafted, emotional and intelligent telling of the choice to conform or rebel.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest stars Jack Nicholson as Randal McMurphy, a prisoner who decides he'd have a better time serving out his sentence in a mental ward, but ultimately ends up enlivening the patients there and showing them the beauty of life.Jack Nicholson's performance as McMurphy is deservedly Oscar-winning, inspiring, and is surely one of the best of his career.  As the naive Billy Bibbit, Brad Douriff is impressive and touching in his film debut.  Louise Fletcher does well as Nurse Ratched, even though she doesn't really compare to the tough-as-nails Big Nurse as written of by Kesey.  She is more than up to the performance, however, and is effective as the ice-cold Ratched.A truly inspiration film with fantastic performances, terrific scenes, and a double-edged, satisfying ending.9 out of 10",9,2,3,27 November 2000
Scream 2," Like Most Sequels, Nowhere Near the First
","For some reason, Scream 2 seems like a movie that was forced to be made just because of the huge success of the first's original formula, that is, to overtly reveal the cheap tricks of the horror movie.  It doesn't seem fresh, has a thin storyline, contrived characters, plays like a rehash, and concludes with an ending that seems patched on and is completely unsatisfying.Scream 2 starts up with a fantastic shocker of a scene, where a murder takes place in a movie theater showing the film 'Stab,' a spinoff of the events in Woodsboro in the first Scream film.  It's a terrific opening, as we see that Neve Campbell is now in college and is unnerved by the killing, suspecting it could be the 'sequel' she was warned about in the first installment.While the movie may start with a fantastic, twisted scene, it's all downhill from there.  The survivors from Scream are back, and their familiarity helps bolster the sometimes slow, plodding scenes.  There's also much more gore here, but while Scream used it sporadically, Scream 2 certainly seems to rely on it to shock its viewers rather than the clever, manipulative scripting of the first.  The device of revealing the horror movie convention doesn't seem as fresh anymore; instead it seems like a cheap convention itself.Not to say there aren't some scenes in Scream 2 that aren't wonderfully shot by Wes Craven, including a thrilling (if not too short) car chase, a frenzied search for a cell phone, and a poignant death.  But it's ending is much too farfetched and strikes the viewer much like the killer strikes with his knife: completely out of nowhere, without warning.Scream is by far the superior of the trilogy, feeling much more inventive than this sequel.  When a film student in the movies remarks that 'the sequel destroyed the genre,' you can't help but feel it's true at the end of this movie.  Fans of the first will be certainly be disappointed with this film's lackluster script and contrived ending.  6 out of 10",6,0,0,23 November 2000
Scream," Craven Rejuvenates The Genre He Pioneered
","Wes Craven's Scream is a welcome, fresh, and fun endeavor into the seemingly tapped horror genre. It's smart, fast-paced, deliciously self-referrential and tense, but above that, it's a breath of life into the tired, predictable horror movie.When a killer begins terrorizing a small town with is love of slasher films and incessant quizzing, Neve Campbell becomes the object of his perversion and just about everyone becomes a suspect.Kevin Williamson's smart, tight script highly original method of literally revealing all the cliches and 'rules' followed in making a horror film.  The fact that the film's devices make it much more interesting, leaving the viewer to wonder exactly what will be done to create suspense now that the bag of tricks has been emptied.  Craven's direction is once-again in top form, and this is certainly one of his most suspenseful films since her introduced the proverbial nightmare walker, Freddy Kreuger.  Unlike Nightmare on Elm Street, however, the tension is built not only by the killer but by the revelation of horror tactics.  Scream is certainly not as gory as some of Craven's other outings, but it will still satisfy gore-lovers.Performance wise, the cast is an effective array of over-confident teens, with Lillard's annoyingly off-beat character stealing a few scenes.  Neve Campbell does well, making Sidney a strong, formidable foe as the Langenkamp-esque heroine. Skeet Ulrich eminates Johnny Depp during some scenes and fares well as Campbell's boyfriend.With its self-referrential quirkiness, some truly genuine scares, and a pulse-pounding, satisfying last half hour, Scream delivers the goods as an inventive horror film and reinforces Craven's masterful standing in the genre.8 out of 10",8,0,0,23 November 2000
Cube," Absorbing, Tense, Smart Sci-Fi Thriller
","Vincenzo Natali's Cube is a thoroughly absorbing, tense, nail-biting, and wholly original sci-fi thriller soaked in adrenaline.Cube is about a handful of people who awaken to find themselves in a maze of cubes that are identical but for their colors: some are orange, green, red, or blue.  As they move about the cubes, they discover that some are equipped with deadly, sadistic traps.The power of Cube lies in its seemingly simplistic storytelling: these people don't know how they got there, why they are there, who put them there, or what the whole thing means, but with no food or water, they decide they better find a way out, and fast.  The setting provides a tense, clausterphobic nightmare, with the strange, darkly lit walls of the cubes covered in odd, almost alien figures and writing, as if they were some kind of extra-terrestrial hieroglyphics.  The simplicity of the entire production design makes it a wholly believable, stomach-churning realistic situation. They're aided by a fantastic script that truly makes the most of the paranoid characters and overwhelming setting.The cast of relative uknowns does an excellent job of conveying the paranoia and fear apparent in being stuck in an experiment that is a both sickly logical and illogical.  While the script is busy unraveling the mystery of the maze they're in, it doesn't neglect to show us why these people should survive.  The characters, much like the maze itself, are multi-faceted and filled with traps of their own.  If seeing them attempt to survive the demonic cube maze isn't enough to invoke suspense, the film douses itself with characters who are as rigid and filled with hidden danger, giving the audience a double dose of terror.In a film that takes place entirely in the same surroundings, it's amazing how effective Cube is in building a mountain of suspense in what appears to be a very constricting area.  The film could have turned into monotony: two hours of it shot in the same scene.  Director Natali uses this to his advantage, however, and delivers a truly terrifying, gripping, almost suffocating  film dripping with enough tension to fill more than a few vapid horror and sci-fi films.  With an effective cast, a script with brains and originality to spare, Cube is easily one of the most inventive and utterly frightening sci-fi films ever.9 out of 10",9,0,1,14 December 2000
Gladiator," Powerful, Herculean Filmmaking
","Director Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a stunning, powerful epic that boasts some fantastic visuals, a solid story, deep characters, intense fight sequences, and bravura performances, making it very likely to grab a few Oscar nominations.  At the least, it's certainly the most entertaining film of the 2000 summer.Russel Crowe stars as General Maximus, devoted to the glory of Rome and a successful military man. When the dying Emperor decides to appoint Maximus as his successor, scheming prince Commodus (a brilliant Joaquin Phoenix) decides to do whatever it takes to assure he will be the next Caesar. Maximus escapes his clutches, but then returns to Rome as a gladiator and wants to exact revenge upon the evil emperorAs Maximus, Russel Crowe shows he is not only a great actor, but a star: Gladiator virtually secures his stature as a leading man.  His performance as Maximus is strong and emotional.  Though his acting talent was proven when he played Bud White in Curtis Hanson's atmospheric L.A. Confidential, Gladiator proves he can carry a film as a major star.  His character is also not a cardboard cutout and shows depth: the writers, thankfully, don't make Maximus a macho, indestructible killing machine and instead he shows sensitivity, devotion, power, and strength.Thankfully, the writers do not forget the villainous counterpart and also give Emperor Commodus depth , replacing what could be the usual out-and-out tyrant character with a tragic, weak, and ultimately inept ruler.  Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as Commodus, in some scenes evoking pity for his character, only to become reviling in the next.  While Gladiator can be seen as a star vehicle for Crowe, it can also be seen as a display of the fantastic talent Joaquin Phoenix has.  His controlled, calculated performance is effectively cringe-inducing.Director Ridley Scott not only gets great performances from the entire cast, but the visual effects employed are equally stunning.  The magnificent views of Rome, the towering, hulking Collosseum, the brutal, striking battles, and intricate costumes all are used to immerse the viewer in the spectacle that was once Rome. While the story may drag a bit in a few places, the overall power is not muted one bit thanks to Scott's masterful helming of this powerful, entertaining film.9 out of 10",9,1,1,22 November 2000
