Iron Man 3," Lethal Weapon Man 3
","Shane Black's hilarious comic book movie spoof!Ostensibly a Diznee franchise sequel, the latest entry in megalomaniac capitalist Tony Stark's cybernetic journal is nothing more than a parody of what has come before, a special effects-stuffed turkey whose stale, cold leftovers would not even satisfy a porky Comic Con fan boy.The cowards at Marvel, afraid to unleash a truly righteous villain against Stark's falsely patriotic robot alter ego, dump the bin Laden-like Mandarin character halfway through this loud, prolonged video game masquerading as cinema in favor of a fey, bare-chested Richard Branson knockoff intent on destroying the world and bedding Gwyneth Paltrow, or vice-versa.The Mandarin is a phony, as fake as RDJ's waxen-faced performance, with the early scenes of revolutionary fervor and violent reaction to continued colonial oppression merely feints in a convoluted plot to – well, to get us to the end of the hopelessly overlong CGI spectacle. Capitalism rules the narrative, as it does the real world, so a tween boy's happiness spelled out in toys bought with Stark blood money is as close to a cheerful ending as this shameful cartoon can get. Shane Black, who promised us his last action hero a couple of decades ago, is resurrected from Hollywood no man's land to fumble his way through the pixelated panels of this comic book disaster, tying it all together in a pretty digital package with much explosion and mayhem, his 1980's modus operandi. That there is 'no there there' is as much trouble to Marvel and Black as their frightened western consumer's approach to eliminating an actual antagonist. Tony Stark is, and always has been, a rat bastard of an arms dealer turned savior of the Armor-ican way. This is no more evident in the fact that he allows his hot blond girlfriend to be turned into a genetically altered monster, then casually 'saves her life' off screen, while in the coda he gets his heart repaired by the best surgeon money can buy: himself. This is a movie filled with such offhand adolescent irrelevancies. Adults could not care a whit about any of it.If the bottom line overlords at Dizzy had allowed it, Iron Man should have gone metal boot to combat boot with the 'terrorist' Mandarin, and then we'd see the real fallout of Stark's first insidious armorer's holiday to the Middle East (can you say Jericho missile, anyone). As Gandalf might say, 'dealing out death and judgment' is not so easy. It certainly shouldn't be left to some smart ass arms company CEO.Like the faux patriotism and plastic industrial America the movie's makers obviously worship, the CGI-blasted mayhem of the movie's climax is nothing but fake sighs and moans. All that matters is Stark gets his mojo back – and never has to face off against displaced people's anger. The Mandarin might be a 'terrorist,' but as depicted in the first half of the movie he is certainly righteously angry - and very funny. Stark, Diznee, Marvel and all corporate goons deserve retribution at the hands of the people's chaos, but instead they sit around the board table chuckling at this prolonged SNL spoof they have concocted for the fan boys, and the millions r(e)aped in profits as yet another company boss wins the day.",2,0,2,1 December 2013
World War Z," At least it's human
","So many summer blockbusters, so little time. WORLD WAR Z is based on the first novel by Max Brooks, son of comedy legend Mel Brooks. I read his ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE with some relish (and learned a fire ax or pickax is the way to go), but have to admit I could not get through the stolid stylings of his first novel.Let me state right up front that I am an unreformed George Romero/slow-moving zombies fan. While not a leftist I thoroughly enjoyed his last two -- of the Dead flicks, almost wholly for the sociological/political subtext and use of self-referential media. As one who loathes post-modernism that is a strange statement to make, but I stand (lurch?) by it.Now we have WORLD WAR Z, a world-spanning epic of a fast-moving zombie plague. Decently directly but obviously re-shot, re-cut, re-everything (oh, those tagged on VO narratives, don't you love it - *cough* Blade Runner *cough*), this is as much a star vehicle for Mr. Angelina Jolie than merely apocalyptic soap opera.The movie starts out well, fast-paced and zombie-saturated from the git-go, hop-skipping from Philadelphia to South Korea to Jerusalem, but then comes to a roaring, screeching plane crash of a stop in Cardiff, Wales, at a WHO research facility. Here we have Brad Pitt and a super cute/super tough (if now one-handed) Israeli soldier (played by Daniella Kertesz; Hollywood PLEASE get this woman a starring role) lost in a vast medical building infested with the living dead. Just your basic night our at any big city emergency room, folks.Needless to say Brad saves the day and gets back to his loving family (who have been cooped up in a remote Canadian enclave since halfway through the picture). Now we get the VO narrative exposition, a montage of unused movie scenes, a promise of a sequel (since the zombie plague wasn't quite solved, you see). I don't think there will be a sequel. The movie is a lot of fun and keeps you on edge, but it is clear there was never any ending. Funny thing, writers (and producers and directors) are supposed to come up with endings for stories. It's kind of their vocation, you know?George Romero, still the master of this genre, taught us that all zombie flicks are about the human survivor, the human condition, and not how many people get eaten (or in WWZ, merely gnawed upon). The human condition is everything, not CGI effects or plastic cinematography (see my review of MAN OF STEEL for a rant against contemporary filmless-making). Brad's character's whole purpose is to get back to his wife and daughters. That's plenty enough for me. SPECIAL NOTE: Loved the cinematography of Jerusalem. Simply gorgeous. I hope this movie was shot on film.",7,1,3,9 July 2013
Man of Steel," Movie of Steel: Digital Nihilism in the Post Post Modern Age
","This ain't your granddaddy's Superman - it is your cyborg great grandson's. Zack Snyder has become the Michael Bay of superhero movie makers: all flash, all sizzle, sound and fury signifying - etc. He has seen the future of film art and it contains no film. Only the vapid vapors of what came before, absent of memory, beauty, hope and real heroics. Hollywood is a Xerox machine duplicating comic book movies for two dimensional moviegoers. We get the carbon copies we deserve.An insult to Christopher Reeve's memory from the beginning, this CGI-soaked space opera is nothing like any Superman movie that has come before. It's like E.E. 'Doc' Smith rose from the grave and tapped J. Michael Straczynski on the shoulder and gurgled 'let's make a flicker, sonny boy - with ray guns and spaceships and army men, oh my!' Juvenile from beginning to end, a wet dream for the geeky programmer/graphic novel collector, MAN OF STEEL is nothing if not - nothing, an empty metal bucket clanging noisily as it bounces down the Kent's farmhouse stairs outside Smallville.No heart, no soul, just a blurred gray background painting with no definition - except the detonations. Never has a war movie seemed so desolate. Battlefield Earth, under siege by megalomaniacal aliens in bondage attire, is laid waste, razed by the utter lack of imagination of the boys in charge of this adolescent mess. They should have called it MAN OF KRYPTON, for all the short shrift given to actual human characters. General Zod might be ticked off her spent all those years in the Phantom Zone, but we all had to sit through this overlong epic delivered by overpaid paperboys.Digital era directors think if you throw a few talented 'heavyweight' actors into a computer-generated stew the seasoning will lighten the metallic taste. No human actor or character could survive such a travesty of industrial design. MAN OF STEEL is not movie-making, it is post post-modern myth-making, by the pretentious half-minds that brought you a whispering, sulking Bruce Wayne haunting his own mansion. Just add a dash of steel gray cinematography and presto, the machine world replaces the movable human feast of emotion, and soul searching, and other traits of real dramatic characters.Flaming wreckage and toppling skyscrapers - so reminiscent of 9/11 you'd think no one involved in this ill-fated production was born in America - overshadow love, caring, compassion - all the beauty of human life that the world's best IBM servers cannot salvage. Ma and Pa Kent, the audience's only real down to earth connection to the story, are relegated to cameos and flashbacks, as if Snyder were angry he had to include them at all.MAN OF STEEL should be the nadir of digital movie-making, a long, cold blast of stale wind down a financial district canyon. Instead, all big budget movies aspire to its inhuman madness, for the Terminator lurks in us all. Cameron, Nolan, Bay, Snyder, et al have an utter contempt for humanity in every frame they shoot - er - digitize. Billions are spent on visualizing what they dream about after late night chili. And everyone must DIE in the end. Metropolis, looking every inch like New York, is blasted to hell with abandon, like these men-boys were knocking down plastic army men in the backyard mud.When adults made movies they aspired to cinematic art, with fleshy beings just like you and me populating their original stories. The Cyborgs of Wall Street run the show these days, and the adolescents in the director's chairs - the slaves of multinational shareholders - want bigger and louder explosions, not any real relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane, or a narrative that even makes the slightest sense. Comic book movies are silly in the conception, but at least Chris Reeve's smile and the warmth of his performance made his Kal El just as human - heroic and frail at the same time - as us. The best effect this flick can give us is Diane Lane's 'old lady' makeup. We only wish we could have seen how she got that way.MAN OF STEEL is a perfect statement of matter over mind, the worst of old school sci-fi fascism, and an inglorious proof of the 'singularity' theory. Only the machines have won already. There was no subtle blending of technology and humanity. No Asimov's laws of robotics. It's too late for all that. We already surrendered. George Lucas waved the white flag decades ago. And somebody check under Zack Snyder's hood. I believe you will find nothing but cheap batteries.",3,9,17,30 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," JJ Abrams, I want my money back
","One critic said the new Star Wars movie didn't have an original idea, not a single one. That was an understatement. Like that other overstuffed CGI Christmas pudding Avatar there isn't an original idea, image, bit of dialogue or anything else. Abrams and Michael Bay and Cameron and their ilk are mere studio contractors, pounding together obscenely unimaginative structures from the basest blueprints before blowing them up in a fireball of hype and noise. No art, just empty fury, signifying only box office.The entire movie is cobbled together from other movies, hundreds of actors and technicians repainting the same concrete wall over and over again. JJ Abrams, you owe me the price of admission for this sorry slab of overdone cinema, just like you do for ruining Star Trek features for me. At least I have ST:TOS and its often brilliant SF scenarios and supreme space adventure. Star Wars was never more than space fantasy, but at least it had heart. This latest cookie cutter creation from the Dizzee assembly line lacks even half a spleen.Only Comic Con fan boys will pay to see this puerile spectacle again. I can't imagine anyone with an ounce of maturity or a small dose of respect for cinema history wanting to be bludgeoned again for two hours to get to one single shot. Pathetic, mind-numbing pabulum for the lowest common denominator. And Abrams and Dizzee are happy to play to them, in grossly out of tune measures, blasting the senses with artificial scenes of pseudo-operatic bluster, behind which lurks only the empty vacuum of space.Oh yeah, the acting is generally bad. As in, the director can't direct actors bad. Daisy Ridley does her best, and I wish her well in other adult endeavors, but when your main 'villain' is a fey crybaby in a Star Wars Halloween costume, you know the movie is in trouble.Shame on these people for ruining my nostalgia, the memory of a small movie from a bygone era long ago. JJ Abrams, I want my money back.",2,24,35,21 December 2015
