Detroit Rock City," Rock On!
","I wrote this with the least amount of spoilers possible.This movie is one of the funniest I've seen and breaks most of the clich√©s in this type of films. The story is about 4 friends who have a tribute band of KISS and the tickets to the best show in their young lives: Detroit Rock City. But the main villain, the mother of the drummer burns the precious tickets and the guys have their world destroyed. Every time they have an opportunity to get the tickets something goes wrong and everything in this movie gets wrong for the guys. In the final act of the movie the guys are desperate for the tickets and they have one epic showdown to get them. IThe music is great, the jokes and scenes are hilarious and the conflicts gives you the chills (If you're a fan of KISS).This one's a must see for Rock fans and those who like films like Bill & Ted or Superbad.",7,0,0,4 April 2010
