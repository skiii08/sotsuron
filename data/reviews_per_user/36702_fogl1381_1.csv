The Legend of Bagger Vance," One of the most underrated films of our era
","The Legend of Bagger Vance is a charming, unique, and fascinating piece from Robert Redford that has the potential to reach out and touch all of us. It is in my opinion that this movie is perhaps one of the most under-appreciated films to come out of the last few years. In an age where we have become increasingly reliant on fast-paced spoon-fed entertainment, it is rare to find a film that can bring us back to the days of 'ole. Set in 1930 Savannah, Georgia, director Robert Redford along with an amazing cast of Matt Damon, Charlize Theron, and Will Smith, truly remind us of what we have lost by moving head first into the 'information era'. The story brilliant follows the tests that arise when the Great Depression hits the south. When Adele Invergordon (Theron), the daughter of a wealthy landowner, loses her father and risks losing the golf course he worked to create, she decides to host a golf tournament. The tournament becomes a test for the great city of Savannah, as well as everyone involved. As events unfold we see everyone tested in their own way, and we discover the depth and inner torment of each and every character. Through masterful use of metaphor, The Legend of Bagger Vance strikes deep into the core of all of us and inspires hope in a time of great adversity. This movie deserves no less than an 8 out of 10 stars and truly deserves status as a masterpiece.",8,1,5,31 July 2004
