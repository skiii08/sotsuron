The Incredible Hulk," 5 minutes intro of Hulk
","Scene 1: you see Dr. Bruce Banner sitting on the floor, dark small room, you can hear dog barking. Main light pointing down on him, so that it shows him sitting down, looking all worried, sweeting and breathing hard. What caught my attention is 'day without incident' this raises the question what is he trying to prevent and how is he involved. Scene 2: then we move on to the next scene, this is a vital scene which shows the location, this tell the audience were he is which then raises the question: why would an American person be in a place like this, 'shanty towns' in other word ghetto, where the poor and unfortunate people live (dangerous area). Also music is playing, it builds up tension, which is a sci-fi theme. the location shot, taken from a helicopter, basically and Arial shot Scene 3: next scene is Dr. Bruce banner (Edward Norton) is outside, this scene tell you 100% where he is, tracking shot to show location, camera movement from from behind and move around to his face, facial expression (worried). Music keeps playing. Scene 4: shows him and were is he living, give you and idea of the character, show how he lives (rich, poor) you can see that he lives alone just with his dog. Why does he live alone, he looks sad, like he is missing someone? Tilt shot: when he is cocking 'ask the dog if it's ready' then moves on to the next scene, camera tracks him picking up a book, music still playing, camera is zoomed on the TV screen, then zooms out, then you see him sitting down, he still has the book. The director use the 180 rule (where it shows him watching TV and eating) afterwards it's reviled that the book is an English to Portuguese translator (he hears a word in Portuguese) this tells you that he is somewhere in Portugal and that he has been here long because he is still trying to learn to speak Portuguese. Scene 5: this is a tracking shot (large shot) from the front he walking (music still playing) Scene 6: another tracking camera movement to give you an idea of location, you see he speaking with another person. They sit and start talking; the 180 rule is applied here as well. He is learning to control his emotion, this bring you back to the question 'days with out incident' what is he trying to control or why is he trying to control his angry? 180 rule, zooming in and out to give you that tension, you need to move back, maybe something is going to happen. This is the interesting bit where Edward Norton, Dr. Bruce Banner get slapped on the face, then you hear a beeping sound, like an alarm warning you of something. An extreme close up of his watch; this watch monitors his heartbeat. he tells the person to stop so that he can calm down; this makes you thing what would happen if he get angry?Scene 6: this show you the environment and living style, shows you people (extreme long shot), it's a gritty sweaty feel. We move to an indoor building, the director use a panning camera movement to the left. This shows you people getting change, which means that this could be a work place. Panning stops than there is a mid shot of Bruce, he get pushed by a person, he looks calm but annoyed at the same time. (no music)Scene 7: this scene shows you the factory, which might play an import roll later on, panning and extreme wide shot is used to show the work environment (factory) 180 rule is used again, lady tries to make eye contact with Bruce which we now by now he is the main character (you can tell by her facial expression or eye contact that she like Bruce) maybe something might happen between them two later on The next scene is import this tell you how many months he has been here, (he is speaking to the boss) this gives you an idea how intelligent this person is, why would he be working here, is he trying to hind from someone? Tracking, panting, close ups and mid shots are used, this is the interesting bit, he cuts his finger, there is a tracking shot of the blood dropping or fouling down, he is worried, he telling the boss to shut it down, panicking, he runs to where the blood has dropped, the camera is tracking him running. Why is he so worried about this one drop of blood? Does he have a virus? Music is playing to build up tension. He finds and cleans of the bold from where it has dropped, he walking way, and the camera pans to the right reviling the blood which is in the class bottle, music is at a high point, which tells you that something interesting is going to happen (someone is going to drink it with the blood inside) to be honest there is a great ideal of camera angles used in this film. i think he is great director (Louis Leterrierand) and he did a wonderful job in making this film.",8,0,0,20 December 2012
