The Hangover," Unoriginal and cheap
","When the sum of a film's entertaining parts fit into its widely distributed trailer, you know something is wrong. The humor it devised itself is absurdly sophomoric, and while that can put a smirk on your face as you reminisce on your college binge-drinking years, it just doesn't justify an entire film. The rest of the humor, which is presented awfully, just isn't original. The cast is simply bad. Racial stereotypes are always a winner in movies, and this one just proves it. Why are we so keen to praise such a film? We'll only get more crap like this if we incessantly tell Hollywood it has us rolling on the floor. A good concept does not necessarily a good film make, which is damn unfortunate.",6,1,3,27 January 2010
Shutter Island," Scorsese fosters the inanity of Hollywood
","If you've seen the trailer, and are a cinema-goer who enjoys thrillers or mysteries, you already know the plot of the first half of the film. Thus, I won't chronicle the movie's events, as that will neither persuade you to, or dissuade you from, seeing this film. Obviously, the following will be subjective. It is a review, after all.First of all, I highly respect Scorsese as a film maker and an artist. His characters, infamous for their actions and humanity, have always been directed with a rare finesse. He picks stories with grit and emotion and is a master at such. Of late, however, he has seemingly acknowledged he can't outdo his acclaimed character masterpieces (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas) and has turned to genre pieces. I had high expectations going into this one, despite it being a February release (confounding). I was hoping, if not for a return to form for Scorsese, at least for something as entertaining as Departed, or as gorgeous and deliberate as the Aviator, or as vindictive as Gangs of New York. It had these qualities, but their respective stage time was uneven, intermittent at best. Onto the film The atmosphere isn't gripping, but it is done in a lovely fashion. The story isn't captivating, but it is intriguing. The score isn't a subtle undercurrent, but it sure gets loud. The CGI is distracting, and I felt that many shots were uninspired and completely reliant on the location. But, as expected, the acting is commendable. Some of the cinematography is very nice. Also notable are Teddy's backstories, which were well implemented and interesting. Moving on, my gripes. Critics are saying that the big twist (and it's a biggen) is either completely shocking, or completely nonsensical. In reality, its both. It's both because it comes out of almost thin air, and just makes you feel stupid. Don't be alarmed after the dust settles, though, because I doubt that 10% of the audience will have a notion of what ultimately happens. The ending isn't decisive, and I don't mind ambiguous endings, but this was just silly. There are discrepancies that may make you want to pull your hair out. Without saying much else, as so I don't ruin anything, this was ultimately disappointing. The first half was superb, but the first climactic point is actually a poor plot device in disguise, whereafter the story takes a hard dive into mediocrity. While this film is certainly above average, it's entertainment value is greatly diminished by its latter components. It saddens me that a living master is contributing to inanity in contemporary film-making. Also, by the time the credits roll, you should have realized you've seen this film a few times before. I will not list any of them here, though, as they would ruin the fun of discovery! Enjoy, and happy viewing.",6,3,7,20 February 2010
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Self-Indulgent Rehash of The LOTR Trilogy
","I'm reluctant to admit that I hardly enjoyed, or was entertained by, this grossly overly computerized revisit to Middle Earth. The magic of The LOTR trilogy was almost entirely absent, and while the trilogy was certainly imperfect, each film was outrageously entertaining, captivating, and accessible. The Hobbit as a film, unfortunately, is none of these things, and entirely feels like a rehash of the LOTR, as the majority of its dialogues, blocking, and occurrences are reminiscent (or shameless reproductions) of moments from the LOTR trilogy. The book (a children's story) is a sweet yet solemn coming-of-maturity tale focused on self improvement, bravery/courage, and wisdom. An Unexpected Journey is focused on hectic warfaring, greed, belittling the small guy, and CGI vistas. The sense of purpose, faith, and fellowship from the LOTR trilogy are missing here, even though Jackson attempts to follow an elusive template set with those three films. I realize it is not an 'epic' in the sense that Frodo's quest is, but when the only facet of characterization in the entire film is how deft its unexpected hero can be with a sword, I found little else to be interested or invested in. Some shots are truly stunning, and a few exchanges of dialog were mildly amusing, but all of the extraneous characters and plot lines, the poorly edited and confusing battle sequences, excessive CGI, and characters designed for children in a film decidedly for adults (with weed and 'shroom jokes interspersed) detract from an otherwise winning story. Here's hoping the next one is a better story with an iota of characterization and competent editing!5/10",5,10,18,2 January 2013
Avatar," A cornucopia of visuals and subliminal messaging
","'Avatar' is simply astounding. The unfathomable volume of detail work that went into the creation and realization of Pandora and its beautiful inhabitants will blow your mind in almost every scene. Pandora's biology and interconnectivity instantly make it one of cinema's premier believable universes by Jake's first excursion. I saw the film twice in IMAX 3d and once without the 3d effects. While the normal version is just as pretty, the 3d version (without being gimmicky) is certainly worth the price of admission. Its gorgeous aesthetics aside, the technical innovations utilized to make this film happen are just as fascinating, and deserve consideration. That being said, 'Avatar' is also the most elaborately gilded film I've ever seen. I rate it at an 6.5 merely for the superb inventiveness, beauty, and physics of its visuals. Aside from that, nearly every other aspect is ludicrously underwhelming. While the thespians give solid and plausible performances, both its antagonist and politics are paper-thin, making for a very hollow experience. The story at 'Avatar's' core was long ago flogged to death by Hollywood, and the script is barely passable when considered by its parts. A multitude of hackneyed lines had me squirming in my seat too often for comfort. Its score, while mildly effective, is unoriginal. Regardless, the visuals, especially the enchanting Na'vi, make this a 'must-see' film. However, due to a few questionable facets, some of which were noted above, don't expect much stimulation outside of the visual, art direction or sound effect departments. *Warning, there be spoilers here* On a completely subjective level, however blatant I consider it to be, this film is very racist. As a matter of fact, it is emphatically racist, and even uses the term 'race' in lieu of the more appropriate 'species' at least twice in the film. Its derivative 'white male invades indigenous faction, bests them at all of their own livelihood, achieves hegemony' formula is repulsive in retrospect, and brings to mind films such as 'Dances with Wolves,' 'Fern Gully,' Disney's 'Pocahontas,' 'Dune,' 'Last Samurai,' et al. Perhaps this was intended by Cameron to stir controversy by making an absurdly high investment in something so laden with white guilt. Then again, he simultaneously takes stabs at industrialized white nations, with lines such as 'we will fight terror with terror,' a main character with the surname 'Sully', or central plot points consisting of unjustified mining prospects. These all highlight problems America herself has incurred, such as the Middle Eastern conflicts, the impossible endeavor of 'going green,' or the inherent greed of capitalism (respectively). Ultimately, this visually peerless film, featuring a cliché-riddled script and familiar story, is far more than meets the eye. See it yourself and make these considerations, or don't. These are just the opinions of a single lover of cinema.",6,0,1,13 January 2010
