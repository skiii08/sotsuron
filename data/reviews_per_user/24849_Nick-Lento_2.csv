Stop-Loss," A Gutless Movie About Courage
","Stop Loss went through at least 60 rewrites by different people; and it shows.All the political rough edges were removed so that what remains is a movie that tries so hard to come down on both sides of the issues that it fails as a story.The trailer was fantastic; if only the actual movie had lived up to that promise.The very real 'Stop Loss' policy is indeed absolutely insane and destructive.....the movie makes that case clearly enough, and that's why it gets a six.If you need to be convinced that the policy is an atrocity; then do go see the movie asap........Otherwise; save your money.",6,3,8,5 April 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," What Bourne Ultimatum is Really All About
","It's joyfully obvious to everyone that this is a great and entertaining movie. You don't need to read another gushing rave review; there's no shortage of those here.What makes 'The Bourne Ultimatum' more than just another action/adventure/spy movie with elements of comic book super-heroism; is that 'Bourne' is actually quite effective as cutting edge political satire.The way it subversively/viscerally exposes the morally, ethically and spiritually compromised hypocritical nature of policies like the global invasion of privacy, rendition, torture, dehumanizing/identity raping conditioning (a la The Manchurian Candidate ;-), state sanctioned murder/assassination (and all manner of just plain old evil) speaks volumes about what has been happening for a long time and is still happening now. The denials of involvement from high level officials remain as implausible as ever.It really should be common sense/ethics 101 that two wrongs don't make a right, that the ends don't justify the means, that the cover up ends up being worse than the crime, that being more evil/ruthless than your evil/ruthless enemies actually means you've already lost your soul, that power corrupts etc etc etc.This masterpiece works on the mundane level of Hollywood blockbuster entertainment, yet (mostly) avoids the trite cotton candy realms of clich√©.The Bourne Ultimatum is as good as Hollywood gets. Food for the thrill seeking child in all of us as it also feeds a quest for the meaning/manifestation of human Spirit!My prediction: Three Oscars...at least!!!As to the question of a sequel; I say yes. Without giving anything away I can say that the movie leaves lots of room for a Re-Bourne. I would certainly pay to see the series continue much as the Bond franchise has......only *IF* they can maintain this quality.So what are ya waiting for? Get thee to the theater! :-)",10,3,7,5 August 2007
