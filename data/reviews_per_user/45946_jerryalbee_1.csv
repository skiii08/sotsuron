Blade Runner 2049," Don't believe any of the hype, this movie was awful!
","Big Ridley fan, even liked the Alien sequels to some degree. I won't go into details about how bad this movie is, just read all the previously left negative reviews below, they are right on the money. In short this movie is long, boring and has Jared Leto in it. If I never see him in another movie, I'll be too happy. When I found out he was in Blade Runner 2049 I had a suspicion this wasn't going to go well. What a terrible boring actor. All of the actors are just picking up paychecks. The only decent actor is
Ana de Armas, the rest are boring, script is boring, visuals are boring, music is boring. Three hours of BORING, snoozeville. 
I loved the original Blade Runner, what a huge letdown. Don't waste your money, rent the original instead. 
Will Hollywood ever release another decent movie? Ninety percent of everything that comes out to theater is either rehash of rehash, or uninspired ripoff of something we've seen over and over again. Not going back to the theaters for a long long time. Prices keep going up and the quality goes down. I give up.",1,4,6,7 January 2018
