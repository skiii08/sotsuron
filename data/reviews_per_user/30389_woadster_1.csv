The Blair Witch Project," Forget the hype and enjoy this modest film!
","This movie was impressive both as an innovative idea and for how well it actually turned out.  HOWEVER, it was not particularly frightening, creepy, or even intense.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed The Blair Witch Project overall and thought the three lead performances were outstanding.  But a masterpiece??  The viewers who thought so have obviously never experienced the real thing-- Dawn of the Dead, The Haunting (the original), The Changeling, or the Uninvited.",7,1,2,18 August 1999
