Vertigo," Cantilevered
","To cut to the chase, this is not Hitchcock's best whole work, but the components are noteworthy.The 'Vertigo' hinges on the 'pull back/focus in' gag, repeated enough times to have a comic effect. Other than that, the camera has little to say...it has far less curiosity than 'Psycho''s camera, for instance.It does have some clever self-reference...Helmore is the 'director' who knows how to use 'actors'. The narrative turns when our surrogate 'writer' cum detective, Stewart, tries to direct the vision, by reconstructing Novak from 'Judy', back to 'Madeleine'.But Hitchcock leans out too far here, twice, and thus it collapses. Geddes tries to cast herself in Stewart's 'starring role', but spoils the vision. And having nowhere to go narratively, Novak is 'cast out'.Don't see this especially for the plot or vision, but do experience it for that magnificent cascading Herrmann score, which is flawless.",7,0,2,19 April 2006
Scarface," Forbidden Mirrors
","What strikes the viewer is the notable lack of theft of ideas from movie predecessors. I spotted the 'Foreign Correspondent' borrowing when the Columbian gets it between the eyes from Pacino. And the Babylon mirrors resemble those from 'Enter the Dragon'. But that's about it -- the rest is devoted to piling on its own style. Stone assiduously avoided rewriting this just like Hawks' original, saying in interviews that, in its old form, it offered very little. So he wrote this as part exploration of the cocaine-fueled underworld, part catharsis to end his own dependence. Montana's death is heavy on the layered symbolism.The structure of the story is also 'mirrored' in the club mirrors -- each plot segment overlaps with the next one in some way; before the narrative completely moves out of one idea, the next one is reflected in.What makes this fly though is DePalma. We have almost relentless use of long, panning crane shots here. The perspectives are impossible for a human, so the camera does the acting -- typified in the aversion to the chainsaw scene. The effect is that of a painting, much like the sunset murals put up by the set designers all over 'Miami' (mostly L.A.). Lots and lots of bright, excessive colors and personalities.Pacino plays this as a mixture of Bogart/Cagney/Muni plus his own Godfather II-derived Michael Corleone...in other words, as a tyrant. He would mine this for much of his later work (including Godfather III). In fact, when he tries to avoid tapping the Montana character, he comes across as lethargic ('Sea of Love', 'Insomnia').Also remarkable for the time was how the south Florida community reacted to the knowledge that the film production was underway, and forced the relocation of this to the west coast, because of the implied negative depiction of Cuban ex-pats. Probably, the only other movie that had this much unfavorable advance press is 'Basic Instinct'.",8,0,1,17 July 2006
The Sound of Music," Mostly Disconnected From The Movies
","AnschluB means 'joining' or 'connecting', not quite 'annexation'.Wise succeeds in making a movie out of the external scenery. The composition of landscapes and aerials, and that marvelous facade of the Von Trapp estate are the only cinematic bits. The actors are nicely scaled against the trees, then against the mountains.Once indoors, all we have are stages.The children's' farewell to the ball guests mirrors the escape from the Nazis...all it takes is a song to sweep us away.Julie won us with pure pluck and determination.Ideal family fare here.Interesting how comfortable our cinematic notions of the Nazis were then. Their worst perpetration here was impatience at the music festival, and we expected that. By the time of Spielberg's List, we got the psychopaths (which they were) that we expected. For uncomfortable cinematic notions, consider Polanski's Pianist; the notion that the culture that produced Bach, Beethoven, etc. could bomb the radio station broadcasting Chopin. Later, one of their own is swept away by the Sound of Music.",7,1,8,5 January 2006
50 First Dates," Forgettable Spam
","I fully admit that I had very low, biased expectations coming into this. I've never liked Barrymore. She's had the world of movies in her hand since birth, with a famous lineage and many friends in high places -- and what does she do with that power? Well, she has no respect for herself or her audience, nor for the art or mechanics of movie-making. By age 14 she was already out of control with drug use. I would argue she popularized the very notion in our society that we have to 'sympathize with' and 'pity' the spoiled, wayward, self-abusing elitists, because they shape so much of our culture cinematically (who can forget 'E.T.'?).Having written that, I have to comment that she's the only reason for watching this. Even though this is Sandler's movie, she's the only one here with either an innate or learned sense of what it means to live within movie roles. She controls the picture, though the narrative was intended to lay the control elsewhere. Sandler cannot and never will escape his TV-skit/shtick. That goes double for Schneider.As for what this is, it's mildly clever in how it resolves itself through constructed representations of the world surrounding movies -- that is, through diaries, murals, watercolors, home movies, etc. Think of it as the inverse of 'Groundhog Day', leaning heavily on 'Memento'.I've seen far worse movies...more offensive ones than this, too. But this one will never be great. Contrast this with a smart self-referential vision and construction such as 'Eternal Sunshine...', and this fades into complete irrelevance.",3,1,4,10 July 2006
Casablanca," The Eyes Have It
","To get straight to the point as to why I don't give this special praise: it's obsolete. Not the plot - I mean the whole manner of storytelling. It's pass√©, where something like 'Citizen Kane' still speaks to us. The center of this, of course, is Bogart - an old-style Real Man, not unlike John Wayne. His acting is tight and mannered, to reflect what was expected in those days - tight control of emotional expression, control of the situation, no irony whatsoever...All sentiment is quickly dissolved in alcohol.That said, what IS worth watching is how Bergman carries emotional content - specifically, within her eyes, which tell all. 'Here's looking at you', indeed. It's honest, and Bogie feeds off of it.And how the musical 'accompaniment' moves the pieces on the chess board. The famous 'As time goes by' and 'La Marseillaise' are the expressions of this force which buffets the actors within the romance, and the actors within the political intrigues. The musical performances are both 'staged for us', as was de rigeur back then, but also is indispensable to the larger narrative.Worth at least one screening, but do take it with a grain of salt.",6,4,9,9 September 2006
Finding Neverland," Rigging The Ballot Box
","A naked attempt at having it both ways: Oscar contention, and the commercial need to fill the seats with a child audience (bulldozed into this narrative).Huge disappointment because of the lack of imagination. No exploitation of the times, the Edwardian architecture.Neverland itself is visually imagined no more deeply than a play, as stage sets, right down to the undulating cardboard cutouts that make up the 'sea'.This couples with the narrative hypocrisy: Peter Pan is all about NOT growing up, and yet this entire story is crushed by the baggage about growing up: Depp in his relationship to his wife, the eldest boy in relation to the grandmother, young Peter in relation to the world.Depp is on target, Winslet is miscast, Hoffman is his usual nattering self...his own turn at Hook was better, a scary concept.",5,0,4,7 January 2006
Chinatown," To Tell The Truth I Lied...
","What makes this a great story is how clever the key storytelling elements are referenced in the narrative. Huston is the 'writer', the most powerful man in the self contained L.A. microcosm. Having the power of a prime mover, he is 'dangerous', naturally. The 'child' of the writer is Dunaway, who represents the 'story' itself; the business about the diversion of L.A.'s drinking water and the dispossessed Okies (suggesting 'The Grapes of Wrath') is the ruse that Towne wants us to follow. Our surrogate, Jack, is employed to guide us to the truth: the sidebar business would 'take only 5 minutes to explain'. What matters is the smart use of symbolism and the effect we feel as our expectations are eventually turned upside-down.And as a movie, Polanski shows again he is one of the greats, here tipping his hat to Hitchcock. To invest yourself in this movie is to let it saturate you; see it and you'll understand; the realization of just how deeply this becomes embedded into us registers when the 'story' is taken away from us at the end.",9,0,1,16 December 2006
Fight Club," Millenarian Solution
","There were a spate of movies associated with the end of the millennium and the search for 'meaning'. This one may be remembered as the best of the bunch.
It skips the pretentious, empty action of The Matrix, the obvious cliches of American Beauty, or the purely tongue in cheek tone of (the also excellent in its own way) Office Space. If you could categorize the narrative style, compare with The Sixth Sense or Memento.
I think it stays true and relevant to this day re: rejecting vapid consumerism, mocking 'special snowflake' effete self-regard, and standing up for the Regular Joe working man.",9,0,0,7 April 2020
Citizen Kane," Splinter Of The Mind's Eye
","Most filmmakers take on simple subjects. Most finished works have defined edges, they fit within a comprehensible space. The finished picture is usually just a beginning/middle/happy ending formula. To present it, the whole is jigged into 'parts', usually just those 3 pieces which effortlessly snap together in the mind. From my previous comments you can probably glean what filmmakers are on that end of the spectrum.The young Welles was special, a revolutionary. He's on the opposite end of that spectrum with Kubrick, Kurosawa, Ridley Scott, most of Woody Allen's work, among others. The 'Kane' puzzle seemingly is a simple end product -- but it's jigsawed into at least 1000 pieces. The final 'piece' (Rosebud) eludes us, driving us mad.The opening sequence is like the box of pieces strewn on the table -- what are we seeing? The most common way to solve a puzzle is to first find the edges; Welles defines those edges in a 'newsreel', with movie footage interspersed among historical newsreels and fictional 'newsreels'. This gives us the parameters within which to figure out the middle. Try to imagine 'JFK', for example, without this influence.Along the way, Welles plays with story narrative; who can complete the story? the diary? the second wife? the major-domo? the estranged friend? Kane's office lieutenant? We seem to go in circles, and yet we keep pushing forward, because we're convinced the piece is there, somewhere. Our surrogate in the story has to put this all together for us. We see what the investigator sees, just slightly more because of our perspective; over his shoulder, or while he lurks undefined in the shadows.But far more important is the visual narrative. The compositions of light, camera stance, motion of the eye, previously unheard of perspectives...it all literally draws us into a different world -- the mind of not just a story teller, the mind of a filmmaker. There's so much detail, so much to appreciate and just languish in. This, by God, is a movie.There are many reasons Kane ranks at or near the top of every list of greats. Think of all of the movies that have borrowed from this...it's staggering. That says it all...",10,0,1,28 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Chum
","I'll get the few words of praise I have for this out front: the center of this, visually and narratively, is the 3-way tussle on the rolling mill wheel. It is a clever way of referencing the experience of being on one of Disney's theme park rides. We see the action from outside the wheel, from inside the wheel as though we're running within, from a right angle to the axis, as though we're fixed to the imaginary axle, etc. ... Pretty good stuff.However, this idea plainly chafes against the rest of the movie which is dreary, dark, nihilistic and NOT appropriate for the age of the target audience. Verbinski and Co. should've stuck with PG content, but unwisely tried to rope in the PG-13 crowd...at the cost of eliminating the insouciant fun that pervaded the first film.And worst of all, the rest of the movie is just filler...stuffing pulled out of other cinematic vocabularies, notably '...Temple of Doom', 'Waterworld', 'Yellowbeard', characters taken from the 'Star Wars' lexicon who are given life from a blend of makeup and CGI.Stick with the first film...none of this new stuff is necessary...",3,1,3,28 February 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Bodacious Cowboys
","A fine example of compositional film-making. Ang sets this up from the get-go by framing the world of shepherding with the titular mountain as the background, a 'current' of activity in the middle, i.e., the sheep or the river current itself, and the passionate bits right up close in the foreground.This is mirrored in the story composition; the central relationship depends on those infrequent 'high altitude' trysts appearing way up close and tightly framed; the lives of married men and their families carry the middle current; the spectral backdrop is 'homophobia' (if such a charitably restrained word can be used to describe the disgusting inhumanity displayed in the Matthew Shepard murder, to which this plainly alludes -- it looms at least as large as the mountain).Kudos to Ang for getting the stance right -- no treatises on the minutiae of a cowboy's existence. And he got the musical accompaniment right...repeatedly iterating that minor-key waltz to punctuate the visual narrative and then move us forward.",7,6,11,15 April 2006
X-Men," Bluffing Itself
","This was far busier than it needed to be, stuffing in drama, morality and comedy relief. Since neither of the former two motifs can be taken seriously, we have to look at this as a comedy.The way this is centered on Jackman and way he is directed to play this puts me in mind of Eastwood in 'Coogan's Bluff'...the attempt is to insert a smart aleck into a fish out of water situation and just let him crack wise at every opportunity.The problem is, Singer didn't understand 'Coogan's' structure...in addition to the defined jokester, that movie had defined targets (remember the ludicrous 'Pigeon Toed Orange Peel'?) and both were at a distance from the audience. This movie can't distinguish the targets from the audience: the moral is 'we all have to get along with each others' differences' and the audience is expected to empathize.The morality play propped up by Stewart and McKellan is a sort-of MLK versus Malcolm X philosophical debate. It's not offensive, but it is unnecessary. The whole point of it dissolves like the erstwhile senator.One item of interest is the camera's movement around Jackman during the Statue of Liberty fight; it rotates through 360 degrees in slow motion and only at the end of the shot do we find our perspective again...if only there had been more of these *film* ideas and less comic book flatness and penny-ante moralizing, we'd have had something to remember.",4,3,7,25 May 2006
A Bridge Too Far," Truncated
","War inherently is a cinematic subject, particularly 20th century warfare. Filmmakers find resonance between the subject and the craft because of the similar constructions: armed forces and plans, which mirror actors and scripts. Explosions, gore and death are expected, so the actual drama usually hinges on leveraging tension, or an ironic outcome.'Market-Garden' was one of the war's biggest ironies -- an overwhelming invading force that was halted mostly by fate and accidents favoring the last-ditch opposition in the West. So in that sense, the movie 'captures' the irony.The story itself seems jumpy and disconnected; on the other hand, you could give each day of this 9-day battle its own feature. So squeezing something comprehensible into 3 hours is impressive. This is why the ensemble approach is necessary -- we need recognizable faces to anchor the thing.Mostly it's a downer...an alien observer would think the Allies lost the war. But it is refreshing today to see actual planes, actual parachutes, and actual hand-held footage -- the actual material of that war and the *filming* of that war -- in contrast to computer generated verisimilitude.",6,1,4,4 April 2006
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Bullseye
","Yes, it's a buddy flick - that was nothing new even back then...remember 'Some Like it Hot'? The buddy motif, of course, is the license to have fun: reading lines, improvising lines, squabbling over who's going to do what (and in the making of this, Newman and Redford switched roles right before filming -- imagine that happening in a studio feature today).But it's so much more. What makes it so timeless is the way the seemingly disparate parts are composed into a greater whole: a framing reference to a silent movie ('Great Train Robbery'), 'silent movies' within the larger movie, stories told with the motion of penny arcade viewing slides, sepia tones to match the changes in the plot's direction...And cinematically, the centerpiece is the masterful composition of the chase scene, with our heroes occupying the foreground, the posse always in the background, and their bantering comments on what they think they're seeing, which tells the story of what *we're* seeing. Dead on target, essential viewing.",10,0,2,24 September 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Distant Early Warning
","This is black comedy taken to its most ridiculous extreme -- by satirizing a topical 'worry' that wasn't funny at the time. It's not that nuclear war or communism could ever really be funny; by skewering McCarthyists and John Birchers, we can see here how the joke was very much on us -- on our cultural reaction to those phenomena. Today, we can laugh at this in comfort, because of the distance. Consider how many ways this has influenced our culture, from 'A Boy and his Dog' to 'Wargames'...and not just movies, but popular music as well; 'Grace Under Pressure' immediately comes to mind. It is this self-rejuvenating quality of the priceless fragments that makes Strangelove so important. The key was the implementation of Sellers as the narrator(s). He would famously say in interviews that he thought of himself as having no inherent identity, only the identity of the character he played at any given time. Here he's in his element...imagine what an even greater coup he could have pulled off if he hadn't broken his leg during filming. He still gives us 'Mandrake' played as Clouseau, 'President Muffly' played as Adlai Stevenson, and the evil 'Doctor' played as a Fritz Lang/Albert Speer concoction; all three fight for control 'in' the movie and 'of' the movie. In the end, only the Doctor gets what he wants, prompting his symbolic erectile response...this is juxtaposed with the phallic bomb causing the fireball 'orgasm'.This is an early fruition of the Kubrickian 'camera participation' approach to film-making. Irreducibly hilarious pieces here, maybe not so much the entirety.",8,2,5,24 March 2006
MASH," It Brought On Many Changes
","You know you're in for something very odd when the theme song is named 'Suicide is Painless'.This is, inexplicably, considered an anti-war movie, as only a viewer who has never actually seen one could describe it (and what Altman said about his own work doesn't sway me - he outfoxed himself). On the contrary, the whole story is about the love of the war, of the situation that allows the hijinks to exist in the first place. If you doubt it, ask yourself: Is there is single serious moment here? Nope, it's insouciant from front to back, and therein lies its magic -- the ability to sustain the surreal tone.Note how there are four narratives at work. There is what we see, tailored to the idea of 'new cinema', including the nudity for comic effect. Note also the arrangement of the doctors, a la Da Vinci's 'The Last Supper' in the 'black capsule' scene.Not quite in line with this is what we hear. This is trickier, because there's an effect intended by the juxtaposition of unrelated film footage with audio, mostly dialogue. This is encapsulated on a smaller scale in the 'Hot Lips' scene - the idea that we're listening in with the aid of a microphone and PA.The third is the juxtaposition of football and band music, reviving the idea of silent film-era slapstick humor.And fourth, the simultaneously omniscient and clueless PA announcements, revealing that this is all about the making of itself, later adopted in 'The Player', for example.This the necessary precursor to 'Animal House', 'Caddyshack' and 'Stripes', among others.",8,3,7,8 July 2006
Full Metal Jacket," The Lethal Camera
","Even if this had no opening credits, this would be immediately recognizable as Kubrick's work. All of his essential war film components are here, as self reference: the camera movement of 'Paths of Glory', the 'fighting a square' and running the gauntlet from 'Barry Lyndon'. There is 'Rafterman' as the photographer (the camera operator) and 'Joker' as the writer. Modine is given the task of writing the story within the story as the character, and outside the story, narrating with retroactive knowledge.We love the beginning third for the spot-on performances of Ermey and D'Onofrio. But as with all of Kubrick's work, the plot and dialogue are really just secondary concerns. What makes this grip, unlike the works of many lesser filmmakers, is the supremacy of the camera. On the Island, the camera is on a dolly...disciplined, humiliated. In country, it is held-held, it marches, charges, crouches and hides. We get a lesson from the master in how to build story inertia through visual narrative inertia.And in the finale, the most striking feature here, the idea of the camera as rifle/rifle as camera duality. The camera literally becomes the sniper's weapon. And who ultimately puts a metaphorical end to the deadly vision? The photographer...then the writer dispatches it and the story with a prayer. Heavy duty stuff.",9,1,1,4 August 2006
Corpse Bride," A Wedding Of Vision And Music
","You have to experience this to get a direct look at Burton's vision of the world, and a line into how Elfman hears it.I believe that Burton really does see our world as 'Beetle Juice'-- 'Bride' has more or less the same narrative and story arc -- To Burton, there are no real people, just *puppets* manipulated by minds. The 'Bride' characters are fully formed sight gags; they don't need a 'story', or to 'do' anything...their mere existence says it all. His world is gray, monochrome, metronomic in form and motion: Victorian England. Deep inside, he yearns for......the alternate Elfman world ('Harlem is Heaven'), a tribute to Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson. In that other world, the narrative is musical: splashy, dazzling, free form.Burton doesn't know how to exist among the colors of that world, so he co-opts the music. Elfman's music has to reside in a movie world. So we have a compromise: a happy wedding.",9,0,0,2 February 2006
The Godfather: Part II," The Rise And Fall
","This is one of the rare cases of a sequel having more to say than its predecessor. This time a full investment is made in a visual world...here we have depth in addition to the width of the coverage: the proper dimensions of an empire.The Corleone compound lies in unkempt disarray, like Charles Foster Kane's Xanadu, a museum of memories.'Part II' is another coup for Willis' lighting and Coppola's ability to capture a world in this fashion; this time, everything, even the outdoor scenery, is defined by light and shadow.Freed (mostly) from the shackles of the novel, Coppola could explore narrative. We seamlessly jump back and forth in time, following two story arcs with opposite conclusions; a third regression in time completes the equation.This movie marks several turning points -- DeNiro, hot off of 'Mean Streets' and 'Bang the Drum...' would establish his method for good, squarely on top of Brando's method. And Pacino would establish the template for all of his future thunderings.",10,1,2,22 April 2006
The Aviator," Reflexive
","Those of us familiar with Scorsese's long career know what we're seeing - the ideal vehicle (Hughes' story) for him to reflect on and direct commentary right back at himself.Scorsese spent much of his early years pushing against similar 'Code' restrictions on sex and violence in film. He put manic energy into everything he did, and survived addiction (paralleled in this movie as the womanizing and obsessive-compulsions). He later battled skeptics and naysayers who questioned his budgets.But what makes this worth watching as a movie is the completion of his paradigm shift from character excess and character fixation to the ability to capture a world and move about it as he wills. 'Gangs...' hinted at this, but tripped over its detail-consciousness. Here the camera is free to explore; we get narrative -flow-. There are virtually no face close-ups; the emphasis is always on the surrounding space.And DiCaprio acquits himself mightily here. Compare this to a container built by a mechanistic hack (Cameron's 'Titanic') and it's a joking matter. The key is he plays a man who drives the world he occupies, and never overpowers it.Worth the near three-hour investment...",9,3,4,21 January 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Not Best In Show...
","Although Browning's 'Freaks' is suggested ('That makes One of Us...'), this more closely follows 'National Lampoon's Vacation' (cantankerous, plain-spoken grandpa drops dead on the road; the etiquette of proper handling is ignored because the goal's so near).For this to matter, it needed to be ruthless...that didn't happen. There's no hint of blackness to the comedy, and therefore, no edge. The friction between the members of the freak family sometimes grates, but always leads to Hallmark-card amelioration. That's TV sitcom sentiment, not the sort of stuff for cinephiles to hang our hats on...and they suggest Proust and Nietzsche!As for the final 'performance' within the performance, I'd hoped for a 'Napoleon Dynamite'-styled delivery of a come-uppance...but that didn't happen either. The entire movie was spent building up the tension that the little girl will beat the beauty pageant 'freaks' at their own game...instead it goes for the feel-good twaddle of a 'just be yourself' message.",4,1,5,19 February 2007
American Beauty," Ugly
","Dear, oh dear...it was overrated when it was released, and it hasn't aged well.This is supposed to be 'clever'. 'Look closer' and you'll see the things in peoples' 'stupid little lives' that are disguised by the middle- class American 'commercial'. The respectable dads are in fact self-hating homosexual Nazis, the respectable career-minded wives are unfulfilled materialistic harridans, and their children are smarter-than-thou shallow brats. The only crime is being honest about the phoniness, punishable by expulsion and execution. All it takes is Mendes and his video camera to expose the truth. No wonder liberal Hollywood went gaga.",1,10,21,30 August 2014
Duck Soup," Thin Broth
","This is one of those movies that I think suffers unfairly because of the temporal distance between us and the 'times' in which it arose. I remember this being much funnier when I first saw it about thirty years ago.Look at what we had back in the 30s: massive unemployment, resentment against the monied classes, strong isolationist feelings in the U.S. against Europeans and their internecine wars...This comedy is based on average Americans goofing on upper class twits; the message is that wars are started by uncaring aristocrats over ridiculous points of honor. So Groucho spends the entire movie insulting the twits. Dumont, the good sport, plays it straight as the chief target. Note how she is insulted, but is too polite to respond. There are several warpings: Groucho in his own 'reality', with which we are supposed to laugh, and the 'reality' inhabited by those we laugh at. The 'reality' of the musical portions is somewhat overcooked.Apart from this, the only skit of real cinematic interest is the 'mirrored Grouchos' scene -- if for no other reason, see it for this -- at least that part has aged well.",6,1,5,17 October 2006
Apocalypse Now," Spoils Of War
","You can find an anti-war statement here without looking too hard; that layer is hackneyed. Or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war (stripped of 'judgement'); that layer is completely uninteresting.Or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of Duvall's one-liners, but that's just a coating for commercial mastication.You can try to view this as a 'realistic' Vietnam war film, but ask any veteran and he'll swat down that notion -- most vets will say it stinks.Or view it as a 'will he or won't he' morality play -- nothing rich there, either.Where I found the value was in the superb self-reference. Coppola needed a container with great enough dimensions (the war) to fit the greatness of the skilled multi-dimensional actor playing 'a great man'.Brando the man was as much of a maverick as the Kurtz character. The studios were uncomfortable with his acting 'method', yet he always excelled and won accolades; the 'generals' are uncomfortable with Kurtz's 'unsound methods', in spite of his strategic genius.So Coppola makes a movie all about Brando's greatness. To hammer on the point, he places himself in the movie (as Hopper, a manic photojournalist laden with multiple cameras) to spout his praises. Brando himself is only seen in half-light and silhouettes -- brilliant cinematography by Storaro that only increases the actor's power. And he goes out like the sacrificial bull to complete the narrative equation. Oh, yes: 'the horror...' Other pieces of interest: the great use of point of view camera perspectives, including 'being in the firefight' long before 'Private Ryan'; the ground breaking use of sound, notably the ominous flanging sweeps and the sonic depiction of an acid trip.Don't get caught in the outer layers; the rich part you should despoil from this is the brilliant core of sound, vision and self-reference.",8,2,2,12 May 2006
The Battle of Algiers," Tit For Tat
","It's easy to see whence this derived so much of its cinematic power: from pure unflinching realism. But more than that, from clever construction of the visual narrative using hand-held footage within moving vehicles (presaging 'The French Connection') and the analysis through 'surveillance' cameras.In terms of what we demand from film today, this is all quite retro. Its ideas have long since been absorbed into mainstream film -- recent topical examples include 'Red Dawn' and 'The Siege'. Today, we expect a narrative game with the viewer; there's none to be had here, just an ugly reminder of the end days of European colonialism.Unfortunately, historical revisionists seize on this as 'evidence' of Western hegemony and injustice - as if Islam never occupied and forced into dhimmitude major tracts of Europe for centuries. Or as if Islam never harried Mediterranean Christians and enslaved them in vast numbers (Americans, too, among them - remember our war with the Barbary coast over this issue - enshrined in the 'shores of Tripoli' from the Marines' Hymn). Or as if armed intervention wasn't necessary to decisively turn that tide in the West's favor. The fact that Europeans/Americans can criticize themselves in film, but Arab Muslims will never direct criticism at themselves speaks to the deeply inherent cultural superiority of the West, and tends to make us stronger.",7,2,7,17 October 2006
Batman Begins," Bad Trip
","This is astoundingly bad stuff...no amount of top notch writing or directors, no amount of A-list veteran actors could save this. So the question to explore here is: why is the final potion so much less powerful than the sum of its parts? I'm beginning to believe that movie studios can no longer come up with anything original. Look at the obvious theft: the mentor/student relationship, complete with swordplay, straight from 'Highlander'. The City's design is a lesser 'Bladerunner' or 'Metropolis'. It's one thing when a writer/director, or an especially talented lead actor can weave in other movie ideas, such that we don't reject the new amalgamation...but here, there's not one deft moment, not one place where we can think 'how compelling!'. We can even forgive the lack of originality if there's anything else we can secure ourselves to. But the other major problem is that the movie cannot find a tone to settle on. It tries to wrench our emotions through Bruce Wayne's personal suffering...and yet tries to wink at us with clever one-liners. Which direction is it going? I think the business of filming a comic book with the intent of convincingly fleshing out the pathos, is an impossibility. The comic strip can be relentlessly dark; but a movie has to contain some amount of levity. The first 'Fantastic 4' movie found its own tone and more or less stuck with it; the recent 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' found a tone that resonated. This is a slow and dreary hallucination.",3,2,10,30 June 2008
The Princess Bride," All About The Storytelling
","You have to understand what's being made fun of here, in order to appreciate it. The targets here are those dramatic fantasy movies that were failures, things like 'Krull' and 'The Dark Crystal', or those that took themselves perhaps a bit too seriously, like 'The Neverending Story'. The production values of the 'within the book' parts of this movie are deliberately placed at lower quality than those of the targets -- all part of the joke.Nothing within the 'Princess Buttercup' story would be acceptable to a grown-up audience. So what makes this work is the transparent effect of envisioning this the way a ten-year-old would see it, not the way a grown-up would see it. Added to this is the layer of the grandfather reading the story to the grandson. This is engineered to be the same thing as Reiner laying out the story to us. So we have here a story that matters not at all; it's nothing without the device of framing the storytelling a certain way. It turns something utterly preposterous into something delightful and timeless.",8,1,2,13 May 2006
Cars," Pixar Powered
","The good - this wipes the slate clean of such pollutants as 'Days of Thunder' and 'Driven'. The plot delivery is somewhere between 'Doc Hollywood' and 'To Wong Foo...', reconstructed for kids in the 6 - 10 years old range.The best parts are the Pixar components, those being the effortlessly fastidious attention to detail, and the 'camera' movement. This is not a gimmick, but part of the visual storytelling. Consider the way this movie handles memories: when Wilson's 'car' remembers his trip through the turns on Rt. 66, the memory is shown from the car's-eye perspective, not as we first saw it from our 3rd person perspective. This is a clever effect, the best of its type I've seen since the BASE jump in 'To Live and Die in LA'. And consider that the entire movie is a 'memory' too (a computer program), and let that bake your noodle for a while.The (slightly) bad - there's a bit too much 'Disney' in this, meaning the tendency toward saccharine characters, pop-culture innuendo and reliance on audience testing...smart movies make comments about movies, not usually about cultural trivia. You can see the 'Pixar' forces fighting back in the end title sequences where the Pixar back catalogue is reimagined as the Cars would see them, and those 'movies' are framed within a 'drive-in movie'.",8,0,0,24 June 2006
JFK," Cyclopean
","Two aspects of this movie earn respect as cinema: the first is the way Stone manages stock footage - this is masterfully edited and composed. The second is the way it is structured around memories. The entire movie hinges on how Stone imagines his Garrison imagining the recollections of all his 'witnesses' (really just an amalgam of all the conspiracy buffs' theories). At key points, the stock footage and the cinematic 'memories' are sequenced together, producing a 'Citizen Kane' effect. And so I rank this on the 'watchable' end of my rating scale.Stone stated in interviews that his goal was to assemble all of the major conspiracy theories into one movie -- and the result is this elephantine mess, as corpulent as Candy's hipster lawyer. The smart thing to do would have been to focus on one character - Oswald, for example. Oldman handled him especially well - and use the visual storytelling described above to flesh that out...too bad.It didn't take long for this to be relegated to mere entertainment. Only the most hardened conspiracy nut takes this at face value. I won't go through a list of points that I can refute (yawn). But I can advise you to watch 'Unsolved History: JFK - Beyond The Magic Bullet'. You may find this useful as an empirical debunking of the 'magic bullet' business that props up this movie and the theories that surround the most studied assassination in history.So what else 'keeps this story from going away'? Mostly, I think it's the war baby and boomer generations' wounded pride -- they can't accept that the Kennedy lion could have been killed by a gnat. I know this is one of Stone's motivating factors.Unfortunately, this is the same guy who slobbers all over that murderous despot Castro. Stone's narrative is the same in every movie -- 'regular' Americans love their country, but it's been hijacked by business greedheads and fascists. It's sad. Sad because so many people take this seriously, in order to fill their emptiness. I had the bilious displeasure of watching 'Loose Change 2nd Ed.', a sign of yet another brewing cultural war. I'm afraid that within three decades we'll be seeing narrative movies by A-list directors about Sept. 11, 2001 that demand responses to 'unanswered questions'.On the lighter side, this was nicely deflated in Seinfeld's 'The Boyfriend (1)' episode. That's one magic loogie!",6,3,17,20 August 2006
Gran Torino," The Original Real Man
","The key to this movie is that only Clint Eastwood could have played the lead role. Here he is extending or annotating most of his oeuvre of characters: 'Dirty Harry' most obviously, a bit of Bill Munny, but also Gunny Highway from 'Heartbreak Ridge', whose voice he is both using, and modifying by adding a hint of Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong (esp. 'What A Wonderful World'; note Clint's spoken word performance at the end credits). There is a brilliant set up that prepares us for 'Unforgiven', but resolves instead with a twist.----------Those who don't care for the larger socio-political implications shouldn't continue reading.What surprised me when I read through other reviews on this site, especially those from posters with a great many entries, is how quickly 'Racism' is declared. By what definition is any part of this movie or the lead character racist? Webster's points to A) belief of one race's superiority over others, or B) race prejudice or discrimination. Folks, this was all explained many decades ago (and Clint, again, is annotating here): 'Oh Harry's not prejudiced. He hates everybody.' Same with Walt Kowalski - he just wants everyone to leave him alone. To declare racism at the slightest of provocations (by a work of fiction!) shows how we, as a society, are no longer capable of thinking. We have substituted instant outrage and speech codes for our ability deal with each other as adults. Well, you know what? I detest this puritan style of eviction from our social discourse everyone whose opinions are not precisely congruent with the thinking of college-educated Americans in the late 20th/early 21st centuries. Most people are not college-educated. Most people are of the working class, and they do not think in that whipped, perfect-PC manner. The barbershop scenes are there to illustrate this point. Spend some time talking to blue-collar workers and maybe your tender sensibilities won't be so easily offended after a little Thao-style conditioning. Lord knows I've been through it: it provides perspective.Better yet, spend some time talking to combat veterans. Especially men who were drafted for WWII (my father's father), Korea, or Vietnam (my father's brother). They've EARNED the right to say whatever they damn well please, without a lot of tut-tutting from a bunch of overeducated sissies. So please cut the remaining Walts of this country a little slack.",10,1,10,16 September 2009
Meet Joe Black," Borrowed Body
","What happened to Martin Brest? This is a director who knew how to channel excessive actors and extract something palatable from them. Here he takes on an opposite challenge: what to do with subtlety and understatement? Brest is completely lost.This stuff is so thin, we get nothing more from Pitt than his borrowings from his own character repertoire, particularly his bad-boy-with-a-heart-of-gold from 'Thelma and Louise'. Hopkins plays it more or less as his 'Bounty' captain/tyrant persona.And the premise is somewhere between 'Being There' and 'The Seventh Seal'. Brest has no idea of how to tap into Bergman's angst, so he attempts some Kubrickian inertia. No dice there either. The lakeside party is filmed in the manner of 'The Godfather II'. I suppose this makes fine chick-flick grist, what with all the facial close-ups on Pitt during the love scene. But this does nothing for me; no irony, no narrative games, just parts of better predecessors on loan.",4,1,3,13 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Return To Sender
","What a dull disappointment. Clint chose to make a movie about boxing and all the mawkish 'rising underdog'/too old to succeed-meets cranky mentor with a heart of gold clich√©s. The idea seems to be, take the best parts of 'Fat City', 'Rocky', 'Shawshank Redemption', etc., stick them in a saucepan and boil them down to this, and it's guaranteed to be tasty.Do we need to hear Freeman as the god/narrator again? Really? But Clint figured the movie couldn't function without him, as he seems to think the audience needs to explicitly hear him receive forgiveness from the deity.The genre has been done to death, so if one is going to make a boxing movie, the movie needs to be about something other than boxing: 'Raging Bull' was really about sado-masochism; 'Diggstown' was really about con artistry; 'Fat City' was really about the agriculture worker underclass.And one area that Clint always gets right is his depiction of the blue-collar world and his effective promotion of young, unknown actors up the ranks. He would get this right in the superior 'Gran Torino'. There, he takes chances and succeeds; here, he takes absolutely no chances at all. It is contrived, and radiates this fact in an offensive way. No thanks.",5,1,5,3 November 2013
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Worlds In Collision
","Another collision of the Burton visual world vs. the Elfman musical world.Here, by giving directorial control away, Burton's vision suffers an irretrievable loss of focus. Halloween, of course, has no musical narrative to accompany it...so all we as a society have are movie ideas (Rocky Horror, all the monster features) to hold it together. Before movies, all we had were literary ones (Frankenstein, Bram Stoker). This is Burton's home world, lacking real people, but encompassing 'puppets controlled by minds'-- a world of art.Fundamentally, Christmas is a musical world -- Elfman's milieu -- just think of any Christmas song and all the imagery you need is there. The literary/movie narratives just accrete and grow bigger each year, a 'snowball'. In modern times, the exterior has been all crass commercialism -- the visuals rooted in musical notions ('jingles').The collision is oil vs. water -- you can shake it, but eventually the mixture separates. Burton, the Pumpkin King, has to resign to his fate. This is the necessary essay before the successful marriage achieved in 'Corpse Bride'.",6,2,6,19 February 2006
The Dark Knight," Breathless
","This was a relief to me, after the incoherent disaster of 'Batman Begins'. Nolan has found a way to get this series into a regular orbit; that is, it seizes on an ironic tone and revolves around it.The value doesn't rely on any sense of originality; you can see how this Gotham is inhabited by 'Spider-Man'-type smart elites and dumb proletarians. The videotaped terrorist messages suggest those from 'Robocop 2' (an interesting study all in itself), and so on. But the borrowings are OK this time, because Nolan's using a shorthand that we recognize and fits within, rather than works against, what he's doing.And it's overplotted, but that's nothing new from the summer movie genre. If anything, it's an advantage in the pacing of the second half of the film...we build and build tension with the music score and the action to a precipice, then...satisfaction with release. That takes editing skill.Because of Ledger's performance, there's going to be a mystique surrounding this film for some time to come...poor Heath took a trip straight into the asylum and never came back out; and with Bale's own current legal problems, viewers and fans will get the sense of a risqu√© edge to being associated with this, in a way, analogous to the air that surrounded 'Poltergeist' for years. Nicholson's Joker worked within Burton's sense of camp...here, Ledger serves the purpose of giving voice to Nolan-as-writer, the prime mover who operates by his own rules -- 'no rules'.The best movie ever made? No. But a step above most DC comics material, without the preening of the Marvel movies. Worth a look, if only to have some perverse fun tagging along with the Joker.",8,1,2,24 July 2008
Annie Hall," Life's A Movie
","If any one piece of work made Woody the chief target of 'Real Men Don't Eat Quiche', this is it. Prior to this (as the 'actor') he played in the space between the movie reality and us - a territory upon which no one else 'in the movie' could trespass. He surrounded himself with characters who were oblivious to the satire, and the jokes centered on pinging away at the 'movie reality'.Here we have Woody 'playing himself' (under a pseudonym), which isn't really playing...he just 'is' a bundle of neuroses, and that's enough. But the equation is completely rearranged. This time, Woody frames the movie with a performance to us; he plays within the movie to us; he draws characters from within the movie to join him in 'the movie in his head'; he shifts the narrative from present to past and back, at times for his past, at times for Keaton's 'past'; he plays within the movie to Keaton, which is the only thing resembling a 'story'. However, there's NO satire - every cultural target appears exactly as it really is. Taking the brunt of the hits are the New York intelligentsia, and later, the L.A. Sybarites. It's the rather ingenious multi-layered construction that makes this fly.This is the basis the of the entire 'Seinfeld' series, and the launching pad for countless New York stories - e.g., 'When Harry Met Sally'.Novel, scattershot, mostly brilliant.",9,0,1,5 September 2006
This Is Spinal Tap," The Fine Line
","While neither 'movies' about rock bands, nor spoof documentaries were new inventions at the time this was made, this is the best in its class. The point of departure is, of course, Idle's 'The Rutles', though the construction of the visual humor is completely different. Idle and the Pythons are experts at skit construction, chiefly the juxtaposition of two unrelated activities in the frame, or introducing one element that is seriously out of place -- worked great for television, and for their first movie experiment.Reiner approaches this -first and foremost- as a movie. He frames it for us as a 'documentary'; we and everyone within are fully aware of the fact that it's a movie. The biggest controversy arises right away...are Spinal Tap real? And the answer is yes! How is a writing team of Guest, McKean, Shearer and Reiner any different from innumerable acts who also use 'stage names' and alternate identities? They write, perform and record their own music. What the studio didn't understand (and if I remember correctly, for this reason they shelved this movie for over a year), is that what is invented is not the band, but the -perception- of the band and the -perception- of their fame. Reiner expertly causes the confusion by framing the contents with 'interviews' with the fans, by framing the music with a complete discography (even a series of 'critiques'), and by framing each shot in such a way that allows full improv freedom. Improvised camera movement. Improvised scenes. His editing of jokes is top notch -- no dithering or second-guessing.The actual joke content and plot doesn't need description, all of that is plain to see on the canvas -- side-splitting, naturally. What makes it worthwhile is being in the know; knowing where that fine line is between frame and canvas, and between rock lore and hyperbole.Reiner's frame/canvas construction was his calling card in the '80s ('Stand by Me', 'Princess Bride'). But this was his best.",10,0,4,19 December 2006
The Last Samurai," The Narcissist
","I didn't expect anything from this to be at the level of Kurosawa. In fact this has no style of its own at all...it's all about reassembling pieces of other movies into a stage for Cruise to strut and fret on. They include Zwick's own 'Glory', Frankenheimer's 'The Challenge', & Lawton's 'The Hunted'.You see, Cruise is out to prove he can handle the big budget epic, specifically through topping the physicality of Crowe in 'Gladiator' or 'Proof of Life', or Gibson's 'Braveheart'. And that he can top his own 'Mission Impossibles'.The most frequent comparison is with 'Dances with Wolves', but the similarities are actually quite faint. 'Dances...' stuck to simple, no-nonsense storytelling; its visual structure was that of a horizontal canvas. This has nothing of interest in terms of perspective (it tries to build vertically, but weakly); and it's loaded with all sorts of post-'Dances' clich√©s -- the worst being the pathetic attempts to tap into the 'spirit' of a native people. Cruise comes across as though he's pitching for Honda Motor Co. I know Cruise is not interested in art; he hasn't been for at least 20 years, since 'Top Gun' showed us all he would ever really be as a leading man. He has only one objective for every production he invests in - that elusive golden statue.But I am interested in art, not stardom. And if you share my appreciation of the visual master who gave us 'Seven Samurai' and 'Ran', you'll be equally insulted by Cruise's vainglorious exercise in egotism.",3,5,9,23 July 2006
Eyes Wide Shut," Remove The Blindfold
","This is the sort of film that only Kubrick could make...no one else stretches our tolerance for languorous self-indulgence in quite the same way. Especially with the liberal use of female nudity...common in European film, but subject to all manner of puritanical finger-wagging in the US. Kudos to Cruise for publicly sticking up for the artist's finished result. The only compromise was a digitally added cloaked figure in front of an act of copulation.As with the master's prior great works, what matters is not so much the plot or content but the -way- in which he conceives things purely for film. The hallmarks of this are the rearwards camera view that lead the actors through space, the dreamy long takes and reverse-angle cuts with generous lead time between bits of dialogue.With this film we get the tantalizing promise of a narrative game - is this a dream? Whose dream is it, actually? Or overlapping dreams with no 'real world' to bring us back to? Note the use of one redhead (Kidman) to drive us into one dream state, and the opposing talisman (Davis, also a redhead) to drive us out again. Intermittent affairs with the blondes only lead to dead-ends.But I think Kubrick wasn't sure of where to leave us, so he uses his customary insouciant ending. The blindfold, our blindfold, is removed...",7,0,2,24 January 2007
Pretty Woman," Meretricious
","Roberts isn't the only pretty thing here, the lead actor has to be pretty, too, for this to work. The Cinderella/Prince mirage is stretched thin, considering Gere did his own famous turn as a prostitute.This is all about Marshall's camera being 'at the beck and call' of the stars -- what else can you expect from a TV director? -- every shot is aimed at flattery. This aspect really couldn't be more venal.Thematically, this is 'My Fair Lady', without the wager. It adds to the illusion of 'happenstance'. The subplot of the business deal tends toward 'Local Hero' with the ironic last minute change of heart.There was a huge opportunity to make something self-referentially rich out of this -- 'part of the soul' if you believe the writer's airy proclamations -- within the performance of Verdi's 'La Traviata'. But notice how in the middle of this, the camera keeps gravitating right back towards the featured couple...yes, it's a complete sellout.",4,2,6,19 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Strike While Hot
","The plot is equal parts 'Undercover Blues', 'War of the Roses', 'True Lies', and borrowings from 'When Harry met Sally', though this merely serves as a platform.Pitt and Jolie dance right over this layer, practically floating, simultaneously giving us a movie performance and a comment on their own true life romance...the dance takes the form of both witty repartee and of obvious sexual charge. This is what makes the whole over-the-top absurdity work -- all of their interaction occurs in a cinematic stratosphere. Much like their real lives; their current state of white-hot celebrity has them flying through a higher plane of existence.The entire movie is their mutual wink at the audience -- 'look at us and how much fun this is!' Pitt confesses that he was married once before (nudge, nudge), and Jolie snippily demands the ex's name and social security number. This was all a good deal more sophisticated than it was advertised. We know we're in for something special when we learn that home base is that stunning Colonial revival house. It serves as both setting and a way of narratively tying the first two acts together -- that of a metaphor for the civilized veneer of their five ('Six!') years of marriage, and for rekindling their passion when they 'remodel' it into the war zone where they first 'caught fire' together. The movie is a clever exploitation of the couple-of-the-moment phenomenon, far better than most of these things turn out.",8,0,2,18 March 2006
Psycho," Disembodied
","Hitchcock declares up front that we're going to be on the edge of our seats while he has us captive. The music is shrill, obsessive.We float in through the window on two lovers breaking up. A tailing police cruiser drifts out of the rear glass while we watch the girl watching her mirror. The camera floats out of the girl's dead eye, pulls back on her face frozen in fear, it swings around, pulls in on the newspaper, then swings away to the haunted madhouse on the hill. It levitates up the staircase, focuses on the 'conversation' in the next room, backs away and upwards and views the hallway straight down, all in one movement...a more impressive minute than the entire contents of many other movies.Required film school viewing, absolutely. But also for us more casual viewers, this is a key movie we all need for understanding where visual vocabularies come from. The later borrowings from this are uncountable. The most literal borrowing from the shower scene is in the 'Raging Bull' Lamotta/Robinson bout, matching the cuts from angle to angle and in the same rhythm.Brilliant vision and music, medium story and acting, though Perkins made every tic and stutter count.",7,2,3,17 April 2006
War of the Worlds," Attack Of The Engrams
","You may have heard that Cruise is a Dianetics proponent...heck, he could be directing the whole Church of Scientology for all we outsiders really know...this year's intro packet is personally signed by Cruise AND Holmes.I think he's converted Spielberg...if you notice, this is just a reiteration of all the previous cinematic traumas ('Engrams', in the argot of Dianetics) he's inflicted on us: The Close Encounters light show, the roving eye of the alien hunter (the Jurassic Park raptors), the holocaust on humanity (Schindler's List), etc., etc. This must be the 'audit' of the Engrams...Note also Robbins and Freeman...theirs are not merely convenient cameo appearances. Robbins is digging a hole, and Freeman is narrating because Spielberg wanted to make his own 'Shawshank Redemption'...he has been deeply, deeply envious of the most comic book-ish storyboard story telling of all time, and he will suffer no rivals! (he makes sure the Shawshank escapee is killed off).Seriously, folks, the 9/11 motif of this movie is lower than low, even for such shameless hacks. Unspeakable ugliness, this.",1,1,4,3 February 2006
Joker," The Anti-Villain
","Much has been written about how this movie draws upon 1970s-80s genre predecessors, so I'll spare mention of the obvious ones. What I saw draws heavily on 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' (1947), right down to Phoenix's use of Danny Kaye's hand movements, except he forces them through the twisted bodily machinery of a madman.
The plot is mostly standard pathos: loss of the social safety net, uncertain parentage, social awkwardness, untreated mental illness, extreme physical bullying.
What makes it work for me is how each 'life' within Arthur's head is an unresolved dream brought on by the loss of access to 'medications': magnetic boyfriend? creepy stalker? failed entertainer? multiple murderer? overnight media sensation? dutiful son? matricidal maniac? socio-political cult sensation? It doesn't matter that any one of those fantasies is resolved, because Arthur is ultimately happy right where he was all along: in the asylum. The plot device of the 'case file' makes this clear.
How will fit Batman into this universe, where the villain isn't one and isn't a cartoon bent on corrupting or intoxicating minds, because he doesn't have to? We shall see.",9,1,1,13 October 2019
Jaws," An Eye For Profit
","Spielberg didn't get to be so successful by being bad...nobody does. But he did achieve success by deriving all of his imagery from even lesser sources and convincing audiences they were seeing something new. The lower the overhead cost, the greater the net profit, and this is where he first raked it in.There's nothing complex here. He simply uses the eye of 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', and gives Amity and its birdbrain inhabitants the mechanics and IQ of so many 50s monster flicks. This is relatively good compared to the rest of his catalog, because the narrative is held together by someone else - here, the writer - who simply usurps the 'Moby Dick' story...right down to the 'Farewell and adieu...'...Shaw's Quint as Ahab. The absurdity works because of the Williams score which is straight out of the 'Psycho' playbook; also the rubber shark ('Bruce') was uncooperative half of the time; it surely saved this by forcing Spielberg to show less of the creature. He had to tighten the tension in other ways. Although this is cheap and simple, that's what makes it ideal for commercial consumption. Just don't call it art - that began and pretty much ended with 'Duel'.",6,5,11,3 July 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," The Prison Of Storytelling
","A fair number of the movies that rank high on this site's top 250 all time list also share a parallel 'life' as literature, so let's start there.The book 'Rita Hayworth, etc...' is the best of the 'Different Seasons' tetralogy. King adhered to the first person perspective, which is a challenge: the narrator can only know what comes into his range of perception. You as the reader have to decide if you trust him, and so on. King wrote this in the early hand-to-mouth period of his existence -- and what do we have? A prisoner who persistently writes to his benefactors for 'more funding'.Darabont didn't have the skill necessary to really offer anything of artistic value here. We're stuck with borrowings: parts of 'Convict 99', 'Gilda', 'Brubaker', 'Birdman of Alcatraz'; musically, the 'Marriage of Figaro' aria -- it's actually not a bad bit of self-reference. It's the only good visual part here, and even that is smothered by the narration; literarily, Dumas' '...Monte Cristo'...The book does a good job of playing with the readers' expectations and using irony. There's no preaching. And it ends far more intelligently than this does; the denouement here seems to belong in a different movie altogether.This isn't a bad movie; considering the obscene amount of money invested in these things, it's hard to find a truly bad movie any more -- one with no cinematic value at all -- that wasn't the case 20 - 30 years ago. But there's no way I can love it. It just isn't the sort of movie that resonates with *me*, because the story is just 'there' with no life of its own.",3,2,9,26 June 2006
Platoon," Verisimilitude
","The focus here is on 'realism', at the expense of the drama and cinema...in fact, all of those values are crushed out by the slavish devotion to 'telling it like it was'.There are two obliquely related stories; the story set in Vietnam, and Sheen's framing narration...they're an honest mismatch, so the two are forcefully melded together, in order to drive home the moralizing tone. Most of this movie is visually unimportant...the only attempt at worthwhile visual narrative is the juxtaposition of Elias' (botched) death scene against Barnes' demonic rage. Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' is implied (more effectively expounded upon in 'Apocalypse Now', and of course, 'Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes').How many vets bore such an existential crisis? No matter, this is the one that got the most thumbs up from the servicemen. Stone was out to overturn the perspective of things like 'The Green Berets'; they just weren't real enough...in doing so, he started the trend of all successive war films (whether about this war or any other) needing to establish plausibility through tedious attention to detail.So all we get is a morality play, nothing that needs to be displayed on film. This was all nicely deflated in Seinfeld's 'The Fatigues' episode (the overuse of the 'Adagio' theme music).",2,5,16,17 May 2006
Paths of Glory," Essay In The Master's Craft
","This is early proof of why Kubrick especially loved the topic of war -- it inherently gave him two levels of directorial control: the 'normal' one at the director-over-the character level, and the implied one at the director-over-actor level. Douglas would later give profanely grudging praise to Kubrick about his methods.The best part of this is the meta-level of conflict: that of rogue director against studio bosses, which is mirrored in the story narrative. Kubrick exploits this meta-narrative to get some fine performances from the battle within between Douglas and Macready.Along the way, we get the nascent Kubrick visual treats centering on his trademark use of camera inertia - he would later build entire cinematic worlds on this notion (after gaining full auteurship). Especially striking is the first sight of no-man's land when the flare briefly illuminates a landscape from hell. Also a striking effect, on the macro scale, is the jarring relocation of the story from the obliterated battlefield to the court-martial in Schleissheim castle, a neo-Classical beauty.",9,1,1,18 June 2006
The Iron Giant," Perspectives
","This ran a big risk of going horribly wrong, but Brad Bird shows in his first feature that he knows how craft a new whole out of genre parts, while keeping his eye on the big picture. The opposite of this movie would be the execrable 'Independence Day', where the whole decidedly was a good deal less than the sum of the pieces.Part of his crafting solution is to take a story set in the past, that's about the past, and keeping the feel of the visual and vocal expression in the past -- no referential pop-culture hokum. Obviously, this is composed from parts of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still', 'E.T.', 'Terminator 2', 'Godzilla' and countless 50's B movies. What matters is that this is smarter than all those put together. The way this shatters old perspectives is placed directly in the visual narrative -- the part where the kid watches the brainlessly stupid movie about the man-eating brain -- all intended to point out the superior intelligence of what we have here.Secondly, the use of the Giant's exaggerated height gives Bird the advantage of exaggerating the perspective of the 'camera'. He gets to play with focus and composition -- this is superbly detailed from every angle and in every trajectory...Anime without the losses in translation.",9,2,3,21 June 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Caged Lambs
","Movie adaptations of novels, even pop bestsellers with the imagery masticated for us, are a tricky business to cinematically get right. Some find a good translation by falling backward into it, like 'Jaws'. Rare birds like '2001: A Space Odyssey' transcend previous visual understandings, and overpower the written word. You can include this movie with 'Presumed Innocent' or '...Cuckoo's Nest': in each case, the wrong path was chosen. The novel hinges on Lecter's perspective -- here Hopkins plays a mere boogey man. All we get is the cheap device of haunted houses. In the novel, Lecter moves physically and psychologically wherever he wants: in Harris' words, 'as if he chose the distance' from the protagonist/detective. He occupies his own universe of perception, based mostly on sight and smell -- Demme might have really done something by recreating the world sensed by Lecter. Instead, he spends all of his time lovingly gazing into Foster's face. If you want a better construction of a world, stay with 'Manhunter'.",3,7,17,7 April 2006
Casino Royale," High Stakes
","It's been a tough task to sell successively new 007s over the last four decades; so job one is getting a new Bond to fit into an existing tuxedo of fast Aston Martins, faster women, martinis, exotic settings and danger around every corner - and do it in a way the audience will accept. I think Craig solves the problem by -not- fitting into the stereotype at all: he's buff, angular and his large hands are in proportion to his body in the manner of Michelangelo's David - a slayer of giants. He isn't lithe or refined; more SAS than double-0. And this self-reference is used as an occasion to wink at us, what with the all the anti-clich√©s that pop up throughout: Craig clashing with the role(not caring about martini bartending methodology), Bond clashing with the world of Intelligence(getting caught on camera and looking bad).Indeed, the one very clever cinematic self-reference throughout this that struck me was the awareness of 'surveillance cameras', or more precisely, how 007 is berated into growing such an awareness...We see that chances were taken at every level; within the film, the 'promotion' of Bond to double-0, and outside the film, the 'promotion' of a relative unknown to fill the shoes of an icon. The 'Casino' is all about the mechanics of the hottest game of chance right now (Hold 'em). So everything's at stake at once: Bond reading 'tells' from the villain as it relates to the villain's motives in the movie world, the facade of the poker game appearing to be what matters, Bond's ability to read the girl's 'tells', and Craig as the instrument that is used to play with our ability to read the real 'game', that is, the noir game that the movie plays with us. Neatly done.Oh, and visually, it's a knockout. Not just action, but -cinematic-action. Note the 'Citizen Kane' flavor of the intro. The opening title sequence looks very much like the work of the UK's Shynola. The fuel tanker fight quotes 'Raiders...' The first chase scene on the cranes betters 'Goldeneye' by a wide margin, in fact, this may redefine how we judge chase scenes, period.One other interesting bit is the change in tone...this is the first Bond feature to be produced after 9/11 (though not the first released after 9/11), so no more 'laser beams', at least for a while...note how the target of terror is an airplane. The terror financiers have Secret Service and Central Intelligence all over them, so they've adjusted. Reality has gotten tougher in the last five years; so has Bond. They're off to a good start by taking a 'meat and potatoes' approach.",9,1,3,26 November 2006
Sweet and Lowdown," For The Love Of Django
","When we try to understand genius, or love, or 'why?', we run into the same problem that the ancients encountered:'I went to the poets ¬Ö I took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings, and asked what was the meaning of them ¬ó thinking that they would teach me something. I must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves. That showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry, but by a sort of genius and inspiration; they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things, but do not understand the meaning of them.' ¬ó Socrates, The ApologySo here we have Woody telling a story about a storyteller, who talks and struts endlessly (Penn has a ball with this), but can only say anything through music, and he can't explain a bit of it. Much like Woody, who prattles on about every neurosis, but speaks volumes through his control of the medium. It's just something he's born to do.And this is the only way to understand Django -- with only two working fingers on his fretting hand (accidental disfigurement), he reinvented the whole medium of guitar. The new shape of his hand forced him into holding octaves - which can be done on guitar with two adjacent fingers, unlike on the piano - and changing the way leads and comping - here, self-accompaniment - were played. His art was the necessary step before Les Paul, and thence to Wes Montgomery, and so on to you and me. Here is devotion without hagiography, because all of this is wrapped into 'one of those Emmett Ray stories', where you can 'never be sure' of what is truth, confabulation, or exaggeration. Brilliance. Bravo, to all.",9,24,26,16 January 2006
X2: X-Men United," Not Uncanny
","Accepting the homosexuality of others is, to my way of thinking, an enriching virtue...I have people in my life close to me who happen to be gay, and I'm about as straight and happily married as anyone can imagine.So what are we to make of Singer's self-referential narratives of dealing with homophobia (it's less blatant in the first 'X-Men')? Well, for starters we don't have much of a movie vision here, with the exception of the opening attack on the Oval Office. Plainly, a different production team was in charge of delivering a knock out first punch. The rest of this is just a flat morality play, the sort of thing that aims for a target containing 'Spartacus' and 'La Cage.../The Birdcage', while using big, colorful characters.Shamefully, Singer approaches this from the angle of Bush-bashing (forgetting or ignoring that VP Cheney's daughter is openly and unapologetically gay - a fact that cost Bush some support from the Movement Right) and blaming the evil Republicans for all the woes of those 'who are different'...a mother asks her son if he'd tried 'not being a mutant'...a father reprograms his 'deviant' son -- by the way, he's named Stryker after Julius Streicher, the infamous Jew-baiter and Nazi war criminal -- to suggest the US government supports this is deeply offensive.Singer is a person who is granted the extraordinary power of directing a series about people who are granted extraordinary powers...and sadly, all he can offer us here is cheap, hackneyed moralizing.Let's see Singer use some real power to take on the 'People's Republic' of China, where gays are routinely incarcerated in mental asylums. Or follow the example of John Maynard Keynes, a gay man who changed the way the world thinks about economics (whether you agree with Keynes or not), and direct his powers at things other than preening and profiteering.",2,1,4,23 June 2006
Kagemusha," An Essay On Color And Layering
","Perhaps this isn't quite one of Kurosawa's absolute triumphs, but there are definite pieces that are essential viewing.In particular, there is the layered color composition. The dusty soldiers in the foreground, with the army marching from right to left in the middle of the shot against the low sun and blood red sky...the 'offering of sake to the lake god' and the layers of observers...the decimation of Wind, Fire and Forest...visual feasts, all, with the elements stacked a good three layers deep (and sometimes more).The 'story' is really about the triumph of Western storytelling over traditional forms - Shakespeare over Noh theater, Catholic benediction over indigenous faith, even red wine over sake...but especially Western muskets over cavalry, lances and Sun Tzu's war philosophies.The viewer detects strong self-reference in the craft: Kurosawa as a 'thief' of ideas hired to play another character, within an sustained illusion, then cast out by the elites when his usefulness expires.",9,1,3,2 September 2006
Rear Window," Funneled World
","My sense is that Hitchcock was an expert at bringing us into a film world, and keeping us there. Strangely, he seemed largely unable to release us from that world - unable, that is, to end in a smart way. 'The Birds' is perhaps the best exception to that.Here, we are brought into the world of the voyeur - the most interesting bits are visual and (wink, nudge) the main character's a photographer. After the introduction to who the protagonist is and what his handicap is, the camera's leg is taken away and forced into a particular stance. This is best described as a camera that is curious about what is caught in its funnel of perception. It's uniquely cinematic to narrow the scope this way, an approach that doesn't work as a play. Nor would it work as a novel, except with a burdensome adherence to a first person perspective -- so as a movie, the eye is trapped, yet free to take in narrative in an economic way.The beginning and middle hold together visually, but the ending relies too much on Hitchcock's trademark visual gags. The story narrative fails to engage us in any real sort of game -- we know the suspect cannot be innocent, no matter how much we suspend our disbelief of Jeff's story. It spends far too much time locked in a pointless struggle with itself over plausibility.This does earn its high ratings, but for my money, only because it's all about a unique crafting of a visual narrative.",8,0,1,6 May 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The Enemy Within
","'Nightmare...' is, perhaps unavoidably, most directly derived from 'Psycho'. 'Carnival of Souls', 'The Haunting', 'The Entity' and 'Altered States' are suggested.The center of this is Shakespeare: 'The sins of the father are to be laid upon the children...' ('The Merchant of Venice'), which in turn came from classical and biblical sources. 'Hamlet' is also directly referenced. These are wedded to Grand Guignol excess.The acting and dialogue are almost toe-curlingly bad. But those aspects are forgivable, because they are compensated by the rather clever idea of the movie itself being a 'nightmare' within nested 'realities' -- Craven toys with us by confusing each level of reality with the others. Also quite clever is the construction: Freddy is Craven's alter-ego. The demon enjoys frightening the characters within in precisely the same manner that Craven enjoys frightening us -- a nesting of realities by self-reference.It wasn't the low budget that kept this from greatness, though. What's missing is any sort of interesting camera perspective or movement. The editing is competent, geared towards maximum jolt effect, as we expect from the horror genre. Other than that, it's mostly ordinary hand-held footage, par for the course.",7,0,0,21 July 2006
Fantastic Four," The Fab Four
","Doggonit, I liked this. Either wisely, or by falling backward into it, this succeeds where the 'X-Men' and 'Spider Man' things failed...there was no attempt here to put human pathos on a comic book existence, and this was refreshing. Story could not ruin it, simply because of a sturdy 40+ year narrative supporting it before frame one was shot. We don't mind noisy spaceships in the vacuum, or gravity where there should be none; the invention predates '2001' or 'Solyaris'. All Story really has to do is direct characters. And for what the movie is intended to be, the key is to not let the characters get in the way of the narrative. That narrative, by the way, is that of a squabbling, but at the end of the day a loving, family unit. 'The Incredibles' (where the family is nailed, and the integration of the family with world is on target, too) sets the benchmark. Here, the focus is on embracing 'celebrity': so we essentially have John, Paul, George and Ringo.For the sequelae to score, they will have to take visual chances -- also where this was bested by 'Incredibles'. But I think this got off to a better start than most have given it credit for, simply by skipping the pretensions.",8,1,3,5 February 2006
Gangs of New York," Wretched Refuse, Teeming Shores
","There's no need to announce with titles that you're seeing a Scorsese film, any more than, say Kubrick, DePalma, or Adrian Lyne. His trademark is the visual depiction of violent, physical conflict as something palatable.With 'Taxi Driver', what mattered was tone...with 'Raging Bull', a man who cannot square himself with the world's circle...with 'Casino', the notion of the surveillance eye.Here, we get mostly Scorsese-paint-by-numbers: the delivery of a vicarious thrill from seeing his characters chop each other up. Oh, the detail is splendid. The problem is, we've seen this before; less competently ('Titanic') or fairly competently ('Master and Commander'); the 'look how true this is to the period details' showing off that adorns the simple inevitability of the central story. Oddly, the more that Scorsese's scenes teem with extras and all their minutiae, the more fake and distant this seems.And the more movies in this vein that I see, the more that 'Barry Lyndon' stands alone as the supreme costume drama - where the cinematic vision comes first, and the story is incidental.",7,0,0,10 December 2006
The Birds," Tilted Terror
","The narrative here is quite brilliant...the first half is spent building a world through the central metaphor of 'caged lovebirds'. Then it spends the second half turning that on its head by restructuring the perception of the cage.The master, Hitchcock, uses gradual 'tilts' before flipping us...the tilting gag birds in the sports car, the tilted restaurant door's window, the tilted 'God looking down' perspective...small details indicative of the whole, and at the end, we find ourselves completely captivated. I imagine the original critics were just as clueless as the besieged townsfolk. Hitchcock, winking at us all along, exaggerates them as much as he can to make his point.Along the way there is NO soundtrack, and NO gratuitous screaming, heightening the creeping sense of terror (NOT 'horror', a completely different beast...)See this on a dark night for a truly squirm inducing, visceral thrill.",9,2,3,27 April 2006
Jurassic Park," Flea Circus
","We knew going into this there would be little to kindle the intellect -- Spielberg is only interested in stories that can be explained in comic book panels...There's not much cinematic originality either, CGI notwithstanding. The primary visual element here is 'the hand' -- Spielberg's mainstay.Everything is told through borrowings from other movies, mainly 'King Kong' (from the first remake in '76), 'Jaws' (the raptor pen), 'Aliens'(the kitchen evasion and the dropped ceiling escape). Heck, even 'Crocodile Dundee' makes an appearance.So back to the intellect - Spielberg's in way over his head when he attempts to explicate chaos theory; Crichton's parallel novel is better for this, if that interests you. Essentially, all complex systems must eventually behave unpredictably. The thing is, Spielberg never attempts anything complex, and never lets anything out of the control of the guiding hand...he just tries to purport the illusion of complexity: the flea circus writ large.The entire movie is mirrored by the tour's animated DNA cartoon -- all of the content is meant for the consumption of mental ten year olds.Malcolm is presented with the proper cerebral depth in the novel; Goldblum knows this is a joke, so he plays this as the comic relief. He's the only real fun here.",4,11,25,5 June 2006
Rock Star," Inauthentic
","The attempt here is to amaze us with a Cinderella story, but it can't escape the level of a morality play.A talent deficient actor poses as a talent deficient character/poseur. If they'd only spoofed that, we'd have something interesting. Wahlberg repairs 'copy machines' -- that's as close as they get.The 1980s were full of heavy metal preening, but this is not about heavy metal -- this is the Hollywood version of 'heavy metal'. Back in the day, the industry churned this stuff out faster than McDonald's big macs. It required no commitment for commercial mastication. It was the same thing over and over again (a copy machine), album after album. It seemed the principal audience could never get enough. It was finally supplanted by irresistible force, but that's another story...This narrative is simply a string of TV anecdotes ABOUT the lifestyle, ABOUT the bigger personalities in a weak cosmology, not that OF a cinematic experience. That would require some commitment, some leap of faith. This is simply everything we've seen in 'Behind the Music' -- pre-chewed and pre-digested.Ignore this. If want something far more authentic, see 'Decline...part II'. If you want to see a spoof done right (cinematically), see 'Spinal Tap'. This is but a tribute to a failed paradigm.",1,6,9,23 March 2006
The Island," No Nutritional Value
","Ouch! Bay's Armageddon produced cringes, I'm sure.This at least attempts to compose the references to other genre movies.But it's all junk food, all the bacon stripped of the protein and nutrients, leaving us with the fatty bits.Just take chunks of THX1138, Matrix Reloaded, Freejack, the 6th Day, etc., add some Jungian musings, mix it into the writing pot, roll cameras and cross the fingers. Stopping at the first false ending might have saved it.Most annoying is the moralizing...the evil doctor explains away his modus operandi, the hunter explains his change of heart...Bay cannot conceive of visual storytelling, there's no vocabulary here but the most infantile of burbles.The only bits of (minor) cinematic interest are the pans of the future LA skyline.",2,2,5,4 January 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Home At Last
","When tackling Homer's 'Odyssey' within a modern medium, the question is not only how do you abbreviate it, but what modern underpinnings can you apply? For example, Steely Dan used the blues idiom infused with self-deprecating irony to produce a deceptively simple reinterpretation.Here, the Coens have to rely on movie phrasing to permit audience digestion. Visibly, we have 'Ulisse', 'I Am A Fugitive.../The Man Who Broke 1000 Chains' (with Durning as the anchor), 'Sullivan's Travels', 'Crossroads', 'Dillinger', etc.But the key is, all of this is reconstructed on top of the Coens' own 'Raising Arizona' reimagined as a musical. The combination of real place/surreal events/surreal characters plainly derives from that earlier work. Goodman even replicates his earlier fight scene.And this is better than most musicals, because the musical narrative is not a 'separate reality' imposed on top of the 'movie reality', but seamlessly integrated to serve both the art and the story.A fun little journey.",8,0,0,24 June 2006
The Godfather," We Can't Refuse
","When tackling something of the sheer breadth of Puzo's novel, the screenplay problem becomes not what should be included, but what should be left out.Coppola and Puzo mostly get this right - staying away from minor story threads, and sticking with the broad cinematic sweeps of post-war New York and Sicily.It's when the camera moves indoors that we get enveloped in Coppola's world -- this is where cinematographer Willis cut his teeth, and left a stamp on how movies use lighting ever after -- we can luxuriate in the shadows, congruent with the shady back-room world of mob dealings. The true importance of the movie lies in this, not within the vicissitudes of tit-for-tat murders.Coppola could have played with the Fontaine thread, which is all about the control of Hollywood (and by extension, control of us) through movie vision, but this is almost completely ignored here.One nice touch, straying from the novel; Moe Greene gets it in the eye -- layered symbolism -- of how one 'vision' of the Corleone future is snuffed out, in favor of the violent 'New Cinema' paradigm.Because Coppola's vision of the narrative was constrained by Puzo's platform, he couldn't quite reach the summit -- that would be achieved in 'Part II'.",9,1,4,22 April 2006
