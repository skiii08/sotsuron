The Blair Witch Project," soooooo scary... NOT
","I am so disappointed that I bought into all of the hype surrounding this movie. It was not scary at all and was at times extraordinarily boring. A pile of rocks on the ground and a creepy noise in the middle of the night do not a horror film make. Every time I started to become the tiniest bit anxious, NOTHING happened. The only time I got even remotely goose-bumpily was at the very end, but by then it was over. If only the filmmakers would have included more about the mythology of the witch legend in the movie (as they did on the chilling website), it may have been a bit more frightening, but as it is I was highly unimpressed. It is a shame that the creators of 'The Blair Witch Project' came up with such an intriguing concept and style of film making and then allowed it to fall so flat.",3,0,2,17 July 1999
