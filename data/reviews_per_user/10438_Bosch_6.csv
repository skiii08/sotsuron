Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," In George Lucas' CGI space no one can hear you emote
","THE PHANTOM MENACE had a promising acting pedigree. So why did it come across with all the chutzpah and frission of an extended Infomercial? I don't know exactly why, but the responsibility lies squarely on George Lucas' shoulders.STAR WARS had zing. The film was peopled with characters (though cliched) not just actors playing 'roles'. George apparently wrote and directed this film. He and his cast had nothing to lose and everything to gain. EMPIRE was also good. Lawrence Kasdan had a hand in this and JEDI, and the maturity of a more seasoned writer showed through.THE PHANTOM MENACE is, in comparison, like another movie entirely. The actors deliver lines so poorly, with such a lack of personality, wit, and charm, that they ALL could have been computer-generated, like in FINAL FANTASY, and the film would have been just as involving. Jesus, TOY STORY has more humanity in its 77 minute running time than the much longer PHANTOM MENACE.I believe that Lucas went it alone. He should have hired a real writer to help him. Harlan Ellison, Michael Mann, Kasdan, someone who could do it properly. Look at Kubrick. He always tried to work with very well-respected writers, novelists in the main, when developing scripts. I think Lucas wanted to blow everyone away with his 'written and directed by' credit. But, old sport, it back-fired. It was a brave attempt, for sure. Still, watch LORD OF THE RINGS, X-MEN, or any number of fine fantasy films for greater examples of efficient character development. Or even STAR WARS EPISODES 3-5 for that matter.And the survey says...It stinks.",3,1,2,3 January 2002
Interstellar," A Cosmic Bore
","After INCEPTION and the awful THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, my expectations for Christopher Nolan's new science fantasy film were low. And at 169 minutes, INTERSTELLAR is a bloated mess, with a few breathtaking visuals and ambitious concepts thrown into the mix.Nolan has become one of those A-list directors who thinks that every idea he has while cutting his toe nails somehow reveals a Deep Insight About The Human Condition that must be expanded into a movie. Merged from two screenplays, the story is full of plot holes and characters who do stupid things. Some key elements are not explained at all.To his credit, Nolan hired astrophysicist Kip Thorne to advise him about wormholes and black holes. It's the futuristic space elements that kept me awake between stretches of tedious melodrama delivered by various 'name' actors. I actually liked the quirky robots more than the people in this movie. By design or accident, INTERSTELLAR has a strong 1970s sensibility. Think SILENT RUNNING, PHASE IV, SOLARIS, SOYLENT GREEN, and BLAKE'S 7. There's just too much of Disney's THE BLACK HOLE and not enough of what Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke did so well in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.Ultimately, the cringe-worthy ending shows that Nolan was just making it up as he went along. Let me say that if you liked PRO-MEH-THEUS and INCEPTION, you should enjoy INTERSTELLAR. Otherwise, proceed with caution.",5,3,7,17 November 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Great fantasy film with a few...kracks
","The acting was good. McKellen, Holms and Lee were fantastic, as was Elijah Wood, although I didn't connect fully with him during the movie. The supporting cast were ok. I did have trouble assigning or remembering some character motivations; I suspect this is a symptom of losing the background from the books. Movies like this are difficult not because of the special effects undertaking, but rather with making a functional movie within a limited running time. More of Gollum would have been a treat, but I'm guessing he will materialise in the second movie. To me the wizardly Gandalf was perfect.I LOVED the darkness. Peter Jackson, who has given us a fair share of horror and the macabre in the past, delivers my favourite moments of the film. And yes, it follows that I found the nice aspects and characters a bit dull and tedious. The lust everyone had for the ring added a nice thread of doubt which deepened the 'good' characters. The monsters were fantastic, especially the big 'boss' creatures like the Balron, Kraken and the grey giant in the mine. The orcs were goofy in the climactic battle, my least favourite part of the film - how could they catch up so fast?The film dragged in places, mainly due to the many (necessary) shots of the Fellowship travelling through countryside. An unavoidable liability since this is supposed to be a 'road movie', but I kept hanging out for the next adventure. I also didn't understand Kate Blanchet's character. Some of the dialogue was not intelligible in my Cinema (Palace, Brighton, Melbourne Aust).Overall I enjoyed LORD OF THE RINGS. This is certainly not The Best Film Even Made. I think Jackson and Co. would be the first ones to refute that claim. The action is fine, although a tad fast, and it also takes time out to allow the audience to drink in the world(s) of Middle Earth, warts and all. The movie is a well-crafted collision of goodness, evil, determination, wisdom, betrayal and commitment, friendship, greed, hatred, a touch of romance, and a good dose of 'Just do It' ethos.",8,0,0,6 January 2002
2012," Rubbish
","Tonight I went along to see this, the new Roland Emmerlich disaster epic 2012. It starts well enough in 2009, with shots of planets in our solar system lining up (the scale is all wrong) and a nice close-up of the sun. Then we're inside an Indian neutrino detector, and from here 2012 goes careening off the rails. You see, prompted by the alignment of the planets, the sun starts spewing out solar flares that contain, ummm, 'mutated neutrinos'. These particles somehow begin to heat up the Earth's core just as water heats up in a microwave oven. Yep, this is how it's explained in the exposition! Cut to three years later and the Earth's crust is going berserk, just like the screenplay. Look, the film is not that bad, really. I mean, it didn't make me want to drink bleach or anything like that. What you've got is one reel (20 mins) of set-up followed by a string of crazy cliffhanger escapes. John Cusack's in it, trying to patch up his broken marriage to Amanda Peet, and who can blame him? So that's interesting. California and Yosemite National Park are both destroyed with amazing photo-realistic SFX (remember, Emmerlich brought us that photo-realistic woolly mammoth stampede in 10,000 BC). Also, the third act has some great visuals but also the worst Touching Hollywood Moments we've seen since, well, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. Additionally, there's too many cringe-worthy speeches by assorted protagonists – not enough of them die horribly. That said, 2012 kept my suburban audience of plumbers, single mums, emos, and Japanese students entertained with its sheer excess; this punter just never wants to see it again.",6,3,5,24 November 2009
Transformers," Meh....Not Bad but not Great Either
","You get the impression that the word 'cool' was uttered many times during the making of Michael Bay's port of the TRANSFORMERS TV cartoon to the silver screen. After seeing the trailer a few times before other features and reading some reviews, I'd have to say my expectations were met. I saw it with Code Monkey (ex-work) and Ken (work) at Hoyts Melbourne Central. We grabbed some pints of beer at the Lion beforehand, during which Code Monkey revealed the Transformers T-shirt lurking beneath his office attire. That was a funny moment  in a good way or bad way, Ken and I aren't so sure yet.On to the movie itself, well, there is a lot of CGI animation that is too fast and busy for its own good. Often I couldn't figure out what was going on because the action was just too fast and choppy, thus defeating the purpose you'd think. Code Monkey explained his theory on this syndrome to me on the train coming home and it seemed plausible enough: audiences are not given enough time to analyse the action and perhaps see flaws, so they just assume it kinda makes sense. Whatever the deal is, you know by now it's a pet hate of mine. It is a pity, because in many sequences the animation and special effects really are convincing, even beautiful. The story and characters are more problematic. For starters, TRANSFORMERS takes a long time to get going. Related to that point, we don't hear the Transformers themselves talk until the half way point or later. From then on the narrative flows better, since the machines take on actual personalities, albeit totally one dimensional, but at least we get some motivation and basic exposition. Then again, the interactions between the humans and the robots suddenly becomes awkward, plus you have ridiculous moments where massive hulking killer robots can't snatch a little box off a wussy teenager who is more than likely still a virgin, fer chrissakes.As with most of Michael Bay's movies, some of the supporting characters (human and non-human) are amusing. And once again for Bay, his military types are for the most part cardboard cutouts: either steroidal Neandertals, humourless top brass, or lovable rouges. Also, this is yet another action picture that depicts violent scenes but avoids any bloodshed or one-screen deaths  any nastiness is rapidly blurred from sight by something computer generated flying past. So there it is. Heavy on spectacle, light on logic, with a few chuckles, and some female eye candy to enjoy for the blokes. A bit more restraint (or less caffeine, speed, cocaine, steroids) on Michael Bay's part could have turned this into a great blockbuster. Oh well. Bring on DIE HARD 4.0, which was apparently censored before release. Why bother at all if it's not going out with a US R, like the previous three DH movies? Don't get me started.",6,2,5,11 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disney + Jar Jar Abrams = GARBAGE
","Everything old is new again.Writers J.J. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan have essentially rebooted the Star Wars franchise. THE FORCE AWAKENS: EPISODE 7 is being marketed as a sequel to RETURN OF THE JEDI, but all they've done is recycled the story for A New Hope with the same plot devices and same character roles. Abrams has done for Star Wars what he did for those horrible Star Trek movie reboots he made recently: tweaked the story, cast fresh young actors, inserted some original cast members, added fan service in-jokes, and updated the special effects.THE FORCE AWAKENS is well-paced and entertaining on a superficial level. Like the original trilogy, THE FORCE AWAKENS is a live-action adventure cartoon aimed at kids. These movies are not designed to hold up to critical analysis. It's just disappointing to see Abrams and Disney take the safe (lazy) option of recycling a story line that has been done twice before, i.e. the rebels mount an offensive to take down a doomsday weapon that just happens to have a weakness.",3,21,30,1 January 2016
