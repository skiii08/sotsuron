Minority Report," Much better than Vanilla Sky.....
","Man....... what can I start to say?  It was stunning.  Speilberg and Cruise rock!!!!!!  Great story, awesome effects, totally twisted ending, man, it left me satisfied!!!!!  I look forward to more corrobations between Speilberg and Cruise.",10,0,0,31 July 2002
Meet the Parents," Enjoyable film
","This movie was very enjoyable.  But it's not exactly just a comedy, it's a drama about how things can easily go wrong.  I actually was mad at Pam's unwillingness to help Greg stand up against her father.  I didn't like that part.  But I couldn't help laugh at the mishaps Greg went through! Pleasantly surprised at Robert De Niro's comic acting.
Gave this a 8.",8,0,0,15 March 2002
Aliens," One of the very few movies that can.....
","make me truly tense watching it, biting my nails, feeling all jumpy and suspicious.  I have had nightmares of aliens popping out of my friends & family's chests, and I rarely get scared from movies.  This definitely shakes me to my core. 
I truly hope there are nothing like these aliens out there.  James Cameron is to be commended for doing a superb job making it so believeable. Sigourney Weaver is a splendid actress, and the supporting actors are just as wonderful.  I gave this a 10 for being able to SCARE ME!",10,1,2,3 August 2002
Pearl Harbor," Yuk. Only liked one part...
","Only liked the part where all the action was, the seemingly realistic bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The rest of the movie was just filler for running time and ripping off hard earned money.Gave this just a 6 for the good special effects and the bombing, sorrowful parts of brave men dying.....",6,0,1,15 March 2002
