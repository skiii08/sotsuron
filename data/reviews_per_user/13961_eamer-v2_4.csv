Lucky Number Slevin," The Ending Makes The Whole Film
","If you missed it at the Cinema you missed out. This is one of the movies you need to see and will always be loads better on the big screen.Josh Hartnett's continuation to act in more demanding roles rather than romance films carries on and he does well in his role and Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman etc. put on performances that you would expect from them.You think you know exactly what is happening throughout the whole film. You don't. Until the very end you don't know a thing and this is what makes the film what it is. Without the ending it is nothing. The ending puts you on the edge of your seat and makes you want more once it's finished. The build up is slow but it is understandable as to why once you get further in.Definitely one to see.",8,6,17,26 March 2006
Hostel," An overrated below average film
","With Takashi Miike, Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth all involved in Hostel you expect it to be an extremely entertaining film to watch... It isn't.There has been a lot of talk about this and I have to say I was disappointed. The ending was a disappointment as it was so sudden and the first 25 minutes are just an excuse to show loads and loads of topless women. I like them as much as anyone else but if I wanted to see that I would've hired a porn movie. As you kind of already know what the film is about you are sat there waiting for something to happen and you have to wait a while for it to happen and when it does finally happen it isn't long until it's over again which leaves you waiting for something more to happen.From what there was at the main point of the film it was good apart from the 'I'm American, I have to be a hero and save the girl' kind of thing which was in there and didn't help it's cause in making me like the movie. Overall I found it disappointing and has been built up so much due to the big names of Tarantino, Takashi Miike etc. that you expect it to be amazing. It doesn't live up to expectations.Don't get me wrong it's an OK film but my expectations were pretty high for it so it left me disappointed and the ending was a bit sudden. I can maybe see a sequel... sadly.",4,0,0,26 March 2006
Inside Man," First Time I've Fell Asleep In a Cinema
","I have never EVER fell asleep watching a film at the Cinema before until I watched this film. I tried keeping my eyes open but I couldn't in the end. I love movies and love Cinema as much as anyone else who is a member here but this film up to the point that I saw was just like any other bank robbery film you've ever seen. There is nothing to it. There are robbers, there are hostages, there are negotiators. Nothing else apart from the bank owner sends Jodie Foster in there to get some of his belongings out.You really never care about any of the characters in a movie and that always makes a movie harder to enjoy. The storyline (up to where I saw) was slow, boring and uninventive and I knew I wouldn't be able to stay away.I work at the Cinema so saw the ending two days later and have to say there was nothing overly special about that either. This movie was a huge waste of time and I should've went home rather than watching it.I have no idea why it has the great reviews it has got at all. Seen one bank robbery film? You've seen them all.",1,12,25,26 March 2006
V for Vendetta," Perfect, Amazing, Must See
",V For Vendetta was one of the movies which I wasn't sure about but knew I had to see anyway. I was really hopeful that it would be a good movie and I was not disappointed one bit. V For Vendetta is an amazing movie. Hugo Weaving puts on a brilliant performance. Having to wear a mask through the whole film you expect the acting to be second degree but his body language shows his emotions perfectly and you don't even notice that the mask has a huge smile on it because of the body language and how well Weaving makes sure the audience know what mood his character is in for each scene.I was glad that Weaving's character 'V' never actually took his mask off. There was one point I was worried the mask was going to come off and show a really bad make up job but the mask wasn't taken off and kept him mysterious like he was throughout until that point.Natalie Portman does a good job putting on an English accent and did really well in the shaved head scene which obviously they only had one chance to do. You couldn't have asked more from her and her performance is flawless. To kiss a mask as well and make it look convincing was a hard job but she did that perfect too.The film is brilliant and I couldn't have asked for more. I haven't seen many films twice at the Cinema before but I may well go see this one again soon. It also makes me want to read the Comic series. Highly Recommended.,9,3,6,26 March 2006
