Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Great Movie. But not worth the hype.
","The original theme plays and the Star Wars Logo appeared. Everyone screamed and clapped. It was awesome. But, the first part of the movie was really slow. The dialog was weak and the acting was average at best. Until the race scene the movie was somewhat boring. After the race scene the action started. Lots of Starships and battle scenes down on Naboo. I won't give out the story, but to tell you the truth there wasn't much. It was a pretty dry dialog from beginning to end. But it did introduce the characters, and the special effects were excellent. (Although I could still tell what was CG and what wasn't). Overall I give it a 8 out of 10. Hopefully, the next movies will be more detailed. Don't get me wrong it was one of the best movies I've seen, just not THE best. Friends of mine told me they enjoyed it more, because it made numerous references to the books. So I guess you half to read some of the novels before you can get some of the hidden plot. I did get most of it. 'There is only 2 a master, and an Apprentice. Which one is dead? The Master or the Apprentice....'.",9,1,1,19 May 1999
The Matrix," The best movie i've ever seen
","It's the best. Period. Words cannot describe the quality of this movie. See it for yourself. I haven't heard of one person that hasn't liked it. The effects are incredible and near-photorealistic. The plot is thick, inspiring, and gets better the more times you see it. The action is the best I've seen. More guns and kicks then you'll ever see in this rare plot-and-action movie.",10,0,1,8 October 1999
