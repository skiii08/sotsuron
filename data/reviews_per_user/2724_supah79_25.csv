The Avengers," Great fun, but let's not exaggerate
","I have been a comic fan since the mid 90's. After a gap of almost 15 years a recently picked up my old hobby. Much has changed since I last read Spider-man, Wolverine and The Punisher. I never have been a fan of Fantastic Four or The Avengers. And after this movie, I won't change my mind about it.Not that The Avengers is a bad film, it's really not. But it's not all that the hype pretends it is. Whedon makes a very enjoyable popcorn-movie that's true to it's comic book roots. You get a lot of bang for your buck: 6 superheroes in a 2+ hour movie. Whedon keeps all his movies light and with humor. I finally see what he intended with Alien Resurrection. Although I still think it would not have worked. Alien doesn't lend itself for humor. But this material does. And Whedon does it well. The story isn't too complicated. I'm glad all these movies use elements from the golden or silver age of the original comics. The story is a old-school kinda story. Not complicated and with little back story (because all of them had an individual one. Some even two!).The effects are well done, although I think on a TV screen (even by today's standards), it's just too chaotic to really follow. I had the same feeling with the horrendous Transformer-films. Although the action in this film isn't half as confusing as those three turds.All and all: it's a nice blockbuster with steady performances, good action and an old fashioned, humorous story. I could write half a page about it being a little too patriotic and militaristic, but hey, I'm European. I really don't get all the fascination with guns and jets and stuff.",6,2,7,4 September 2012
Source Code," Finally, story and action are aligned!
","Source Code mixes science-fiction with a love story and questions about morality and ethics. It's not like most movies: this one actually has a story, not just effects. For that matter, the action isn't really on the foreground. It's not your standard blockbuster.Director Duncan Jones and screenwriter Ben Ripley created not the most original film, but one of the best executed. A fine cast do the rest. Jake Gyllenhaal is dependable as always and especially Michelle Monaghan has the exceptional quality to have chemistry with almost any actor she works with. Believe me, in the role she is playing, it is hard not to come off as annoying or damsel in distress. And she doesn't.Maybe if you looked real hard, you would find plot holes about alternate realities or universes or time travel in this film. But I didn't want to think too much. The filmmakers has my permission to just go ahead and tell their story.Source Code will be judged by some as dull or talky. That's the part of the audience who loved T4 or Transformers I-III. Those 'movies' are just action scenes molded together. This has story and action more in sync. This movie is more for the people who like to think and not have their thinking done for them. That's rare these days. Just ask Capt. Stevens, main character in Source Code.",Null,1,1,25 July 2011
Se7en," The best Hollywood has produced for a long time
","After the Alien-debacle Fincher proved all the critics wrong. This film is one of the best in a genre that hasn't been very innovative for a long time.Everyone know's the story by now, so I won't waste time telling it. This film was trend setting with it's dark, gritty look and opening sequence. We still see it copied in movies and TV-series today. Everything is great about this film. I guess if anything, the weakest link in the film is Pitt, who is grossly overshadowed by Freeman. But let's not look for flaws when there really aren't any. The script is intelligent and uncompromising. The direction is innovative en daring. The production-design and cinematography are top-notch.Fincher is one of the big boys in Tinseltown these days. Seven is the reason why.",9,86,132,28 July 2005
Unbreakable," Just fantastic
","Willis finds out some strange things about himself after being the sole survivor in a train wreck. Jackson tells him he's special. Is he really? Unbreakable really is an act 1 superhero story stretched to feature lenght (Night tells us in an interview). Genius. For once I believe Willis is the person on screen, not that he's playing Bruce Willis, the cool actor. Night uses colors (mostly blue, purple and green) and well chosen camera-angles as imagesystems (word is that the storyboard read like a comic). Most of them really work out well. I loved the slow pacing of the film. It really takes it time to tell us what's going on. As usual Shyamalan puts human drama first in his script. The first scene where Willis meets the woman in the train... You have to see the genius of it. In a few lines of dialog Shyamalan let's us discover the character Dunn.Another reason why I love this film is because Shyamalan shows he has courage to make THIS after the enormous success of The Sixth Sense, which I think is inferior to this film. I just know the studio execs where pushing for something more tangible than this, but he chose this instead. A homage to comic books. And it works! BEAUTIFUL!!",9,142,192,12 September 2005
Monster," Hard and bleak story
","I had my reservations before watching this. I was sceptical cause of the buzz. Everyone was talking about the way Theron, 'the most gorgeous woman alive', transformed herself into Aileen. A prostitute who killed several clients. I thought Theron was just looking for success, another ambitious actress wanting a gold statue. That director Jenkins had a reason to make the film didn't matter for me then.But everyone involved in this film deserve the credit. Monster is gripping. It's a film that makes you feel almost every emotion you can think of: sadness, anger, compassion, wrath. It confuses you. Do you identify with Aileen or do you disapprove of her actions? I guess both. You despise her for killing the men. But the film challenges that. You can almost explain (and thus condone) her actions. I guess the one thing that stayed with me was that it occurred to me what it must feel like to be really and utterly alone in this world.",8,14,15,6 October 2005
Dawn of the Dead," These things don't win Oscars, but they're darn entertaining!!
","Zombies take control of small-town America, only for the inhabitants to realize that it's a global plague. They take refuge in a mall and try to fight off the undead.Remake of Romero's classic is very well executed by first-timer Snyder. The characters and the script are entertaining and the action's good. Director Snyder finds a good balance between action, horror and comedy.I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. It isn't more than it tries to be: fun, popcorn entertainment.Be sure to watch the end credits!! Perhaps this is the only weak spot in the film.",8,10,15,19 September 2005
The Town," Solid effort, but still flawed
","I am actually pretty conflicted about Ben Affleck's new feature 'The Town'. I liked his previous effort Gone Baby Gone. Like The Town, that movie was filled with dangerous looking characters, good actors, an interesting script and the steady hand of a director in control. The surprise of Gone Baby Gone is well, without trying to be funny: Gone. We now know that Affleck has the capacity to make Eastwood- or Lumet-like movies. I'm disappointed that Affleck hasn't made the real step to become that topnotch director. A director who works out improbabilities in the script. But to say that The Town is a bad movie would do it no justice. It's actually pretty good. It tries to be in the same category as Heat, but has too many improbabilities to be in that category.I am not all that surprised that Affleck made a 4 hour (!) first cut of this movie. Because I think this movie needs that kind of running time to make it's full impact. I had the same feeling with Copland. Because of different reasons Affleck had to trim his movie back to it's 2 hour and somewhat minutes for the studio to give it the go-ahead. The 2 hours left on the cutting-floor have to be character development. It's that simple. We hardly get to know all the interesting characters in this movie (including the 2 other members of the gang). We find out at the very last (well, me at least) that it's his best friends sister who clings to him with her baby. His character MacCrady does the moody-thing just a bit too much, without really explaining. Too bad the studio couldn't compromise. A 3 hour cut could have made this better. But I guess only Cameron and Mann are allowed to make 3 hour movies.Also, some action taken by it's characters had me scratching the back of my head. The FBI seems to work with tactics from the 1970's. When the ambulance leaves the stadium, it is not riddled with bullets, when there was an intense exchange of fire not long before. But the driver dies in the following crash. Trainstations are not riddled with cops, so a convict can just take the train to freedom? The cops on the street don't have MacCrady's profile and face implanted on their brain, seeing he shot at cops and all? And the biggest one: the girl really falls for him? Really? Like Gone Baby Gone, the ending is too soft, too pleasing and too easy.But let's not be too negative. Affleck gives his The Town an authentic (as far as I can tell, never been) feeling. The character speak and move like they have lived in Charlestown most of their lives. There isn't a line a dialog that sounds cheesy or out of place. Although I really don't know what the FBI-man meant with the size of bills thing.The actors are their characters. That's because they are good actors working with good material, but Affleck knows how to get it out of them. The action-scene's are well photographed and not implausible just to make you go 'whhooaaaÂ…'. But with the always excellent Robert Elswitt behind the lens, that's a certainty.If there's a way to get the studio to sign off on a 4 hour cut on Blu Ray, let me know Ben. Because I would love to see that one. With the version we have now, I still recommend it, but I still feel that bits and pieces are missing.",7,3,6,9 December 2010
Full Metal Jacket," Like all Kubrick films it requires multiple viewings
","I always thought of Kubrick as the poet amongst the proza's in Hollywood. Kubrick always tries to tell a bigger picture than he's putting on the screen. But it requires the viewer to see beyond the images. I had to see this film a second time to fully grasp what Kubrick was trying to show me.The film is divided in two parts: basic training at Parris Island and combat in Vietnam. Both are equally difficult to watch. Kubrick shows us young boys being stripped from every possible individuality, only to be sent into a war that will only damage them and the war-torn country even more.The film has an eery kind of absurdness to it. The tone of the film balances between hard core anti-war and black comedy. Maybe thats because most of the soldiers in Vietnam (or any war) have the same kind of humor: harsh, but funny in a wrong kind of way. Kubrick lets R. Lee Ermey have his way the young recruits and gives him all the best 'wrong lines'. The rapid fire of slurs and insults is unbelievable for a normal person. Which all the recruits are in the beginning. Ermey glorifies the fact that Oswald killed Kennedy from 250 feet at a moving target. Oswald learned his skills IN THE MARINES. Yes, be proud.Kubrick's Vietnam lies in ruins. The American involvement seems to have only negative results. It's native people are being slaugthered by either the VC or the Americans. Youngs girls prostitute themself to GI's. Once a beautiful country with a rich culture and historic buildings, it's not much to look at with tanks and marines roaming the streets. The scenes in the final act where the platoon is being cut to pieces by a sniper are very powerful. Those scenes make a bigger statement. They define the conflict: With all it's firepower, tactics and technology, the platoon lost three soldiers to one girl with an AK. An unwinnable war. Though and sometimes difficult to watch, this film is not anti-war for pacifists, but anti-war for humanists. Think beyond 'oh, war is hell' and you will be satisfied with what Kubrick is telling us.",7,85,142,18 October 2005
Glory," The definition of a classic: Glory
","The story of the 54th.Although I think that the makers lended themselves a big dramatic freedom, this film feels real and human. It's sentimental and sometimes corny, but for the most part this is a very powerful film that says something about duty, honor, equality and comradery. I still can't believe that Shaw didn't have more resistance from within the regiment or that the regiment was this obedient. But perhaps in different times... And off course all the black soldiers of the 54th are even balanced, disciplined and ready to fight (with the exception of Trip). Not disgruntled, traumatized or even angry at the people who enslaved them or stood by as they were.The battle scenes are now somewhat outdated (warmovies after 1989 raised the bar significantly) but they are still powerful and do the job. But the emotionally charge comes from the actors (who work from a very good script) although the film could have sunk if the dialogue was handled by lesser actors. Even Elwes shows us he can act. But off course Freeman and Washington steal the film.Despite my critique, I watched this with a constant lump in my throat. I've seen this film a few times now and it still has the same impact it did when I saw it the first time. The definition of a classic: Glory.",9,7,10,14 December 2006
The Village," Sometimes the marketing machine pulls your leg...
","Villagers in a small town in the 1900's tell their kids never to go in the woods, because 'Those We Don't Speak Off' rule the woods. This way the village is cut off from civilization. Perhaps 'TWDSO' like it that way? I've seen this twice. The first time I saw it felt cheated. This was not the film the marketing machine from Touchstone pitched to me. This was not a horror film. I felt so bad about the fact they lied, that I didn't pay attention to the film. Not until the second viewing. Than it became clear.This is essentially a love story. A story about hope and actually trying to make the world a better place. Shyamalan's script is intelligent and he loves his characters. He gives them the best dialogue I've heard in film for a long time. Yes, he does pull my leg (just like the marketing machine) but the funny thing is that the film is really honest. Especially in the final act. There will still be people who'll hate this. But that can only be because they still want a Sixth Sense kinda film. And they cannot or will not see the beauty and intelligence this film has to offer.",8,2,4,20 September 2005
Warrior," One of the best of 2011
","Warrior has so many elements which normally press the wrong buttons with me. But when the end credits rolled, I was totally mesmerized. It's one of the best films of the year.I don't know much about MMA or UFC. But although this film is about fighters and UFC, it's more about family, redemption and coming to terms with a painful past. I applaud the makers for making a film that takes it's time to develop. Characters are humans in this film, not video game characters. This film could have been made/marketed for the 15-19 yr old male-group. But that would have produced a very different and worse film.All the main actors do excellent work, with the two main actors (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton) carrying this film from start to finish. Noteworthy are also Nick Nolte and Frank Grillo as Edgerton's trainer.Director Hood finds the right gritty feel and look for the film, as well as getting the best out of his cast and crew (with 4! editors). The fight scenes are exiting, but especially Hardy's scenes where his caged anger is about to explode are powerful.One negative thing: Too bad this movie could not do without the (almost obligatory) nod to the uniform and military.It's a great achievement and this deserved to do better at the box office. I'm afraid that producers with similar ideas will want a film that more is Rocky.I give it 8 out of 10.",8,2,5,27 December 2011
Children of Men," Don't kill the messenger
","Children of men is warning. It's an opinion from someone who is fed up with the state of the world and extrapolates his vision of today's world to a not too distant future.The world today exists only out of sound bites and religious arrogance: The evil-doers, democracy, freedom, natural resources on and on and on.... Off course everyone knows God is on their side. They are right, everyone else is wrong. If THEY won't listen...lets bomb them.But what if God decides to leave mankind altogether? That means everyone is wrong. What then? That's the main point of CoM. Mankind loses it's ability to procreate. This means ALL of mankind will be gone...within the next 70 to 80 years. Anarchy rules the world with the exception of Great Britain. The rest of the world is in chaos. Asylumseekers (white and black alike) try to get into Britain, only to be handled as third class citizens. Terrorists and activists say they are there to fight for the rights of illegals, but a closer look reveals they only care about themselves. CoM is not perfect, so is its script, but it tries to find a balance between art and entertainment. In a world filled with brain dead films like Click, My Super Ex Girlfriend or National Treasure, this film is a diamond. And the courage of its makers should be cherished.Many people do not or will not like this film. That means they don't like today's world. They should be shocked when a coffeeshop is bombed - killing everyone inside, they should cringe when an activist is shot and dies. They should not like it when a supposed asylum seeker is yanked of a bus and blindfolded by armed men. But this is the world today. Why is it that we are shocked by a film (fiction) and are unaffected by news footage (real world)? To say that this filmmaker glorifies violence for entertainment, is to truly expose yourself as ignorant. Close your eyes, count to ten, change the channel and everything will be fine. Sorry, it won't. Open your eyes and take action. That's what Children of Men does.",9,10,19,14 February 2007
Inside Man," Pretty dull, but above average
","For me Inside Man was just not what it was cracked up to be. Great cast, great characters (especially Owen's and Foster's) and the film is technically sound. But the script stretches it's smartness and the film becomes dull because of it.I like filmmakers with opinions and Lee's no exception for me. I like the references to the current 'war on terror'. All hostages are suspects (like all muslims). How do you distinguish the good from the few bad? Especially the scene where all hostage are gunned down in front of the bank with rubber bullets hit home.But I still feel Lee didn't get the max out of this film and his cast. The scenes between Foster and Washington are fantastic and Owen gives a solid performance as always (though his American accent is very bad). But it just isn't enough.So, it's solid entertainment, but I hoped for more.",6,2,4,9 August 2006
The Happening," If it's intentional, it's still a bad film
","I'm a Shyamalan fan. He's not afraid to take chances. And he believes in himself and his story. Most of the time, that helps. Gems like Unbreakable en The Village would never have seen the light of day if someone other than Shyamalan came up with it. His direction always makes sure his story gets the maximum effect. I like his screenplays because they always consist of two things: originality and well written characters. His new feature has neither. It's that simple. As a Shyamalan fan, I felt this disappointment a little with Lady in the Water. But now, it's twice in a row.In a nutshell: Beginning in Central Park NYC, people are effected what is first believed to be a neurotoxine causing people to behave irrational, even to the point of suicide. But then the survivors start to uncover signs that it's not terrorists, but nature itself spreading this virus: yes, it's nature against men. And nature is winning.I thought Wahlberg was a very poor choice. His range as an actor is far too narrow to play in any production that needs a little nuance. In other words: he shouldn't be in anything else than a movie about cops or (ex-)marines. Also the rest of the cast is surprisingly aloof. This includes Zooey Deschanel, who looks like she's a live-action version of a Manga character. Can those eyes be any wider?The way the information is brought to the viewer is simple. There is a hinge of a critical message about massmedia, how we get our information and how we as a society are depended on TV, mobiles phones etc. to get in touch with each other. But it's nothing major. Because there really isn't much to tell. The first 15 minutes are the most interesting. Although the very first scene with the two women on a bench in the park (in hindsight) is telling. I really had my doubts about everything: the acting, the actions taken by the characters, the total mood and feel of the film. Once it goes into the 2nd act, the movie becomes more and more (non intentional) laughable and silly.After seeing this I read that Shyamalan intended this to be an expensive B-movie, in the tradition of Romero etc. If that's the case, then my original rating of 5 (outta 10) should be a 3. Because nowhere in the movie does this become apparent. If you want a good homage, take a look at Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead (although that's really a remake.) I don't like a these talented filmmakers who want to take $100 million budgets, to make movies who look like they've been made for $10.000. But at least someone like Tarantino or Rodriquez adds originality and a real love for the genre. The Happening is really bad as a serious film. As an homage it's boring and without heart. Take your pick. But you will be disappointed either way.",5,127,230,15 July 2008
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," The charisma of it's stars save this turkey
","The story's fun for the first 30 minutes.Then it begins to wander (illogical, improbable and downright stupid) and the action can't make up for it.The final shootout was beautifully shot, but so stupid I couldn't stop laughing.But Pitt and Jolie are in form though.I haven't seen chemistry like this since Clooney and Lopez (Out of Sight) and it's the only thing that saves this from disaster.I hear rumors about a sequel. That would not be wise.'They call it a change-over. And no one in the audience has any idea'.",6,2,6,11 January 2006
The Departed," Great names, but a great film....?
","The Departed starts of very promising, but along the way the film loses momentum and credibility. It's a great Hong Kong flick. Why? Because you know it's a comic book, it's not real life. Like the old film noirs from the 40's and 50's: you know you are not looking at real life, but at one dimensional cardboards. And thats great fun!But it's not a great Hollywood flick. Because it tries to add realism to a not so realistic story. The dialogue is very good, but the actions taken by it's characters (who are one dimensional) are a mysteries. If you present it real, you have to explain. If you present it as entertainment, you don't have too. That the main weakness of The Departed for me. Also, it's not a Scorcese picture. It's a bland film, that could have been made by almost any TV director. The actors are great and work with some fantastic dialogue, although Matt Damon and Mark Walhberg really can't act and should stay doing action films. The crew delivers top notch work, but for me: it still doesn't work.It feels to convulted and I have the feeling that (even though the film runs at 2 1/2 hours) most character motivation was left on the cutting room floor.",5,3,8,19 February 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Dull and dangerously militaristic
","Michael Bay knows his craft. He is one of the best at what he does. But he has become a posterboy for the right-wing moviegoers. I have a problem with his cinematic integrity. His movies are commercials instead of films. Now, Transformers isn't The Great Gatsby. I know that. But Transformers has no story, no soul and has such a dangerous underlying militaristic tone: it presses all the wrong buttons with me.The movie is aimed at video-gaming 13 to 17 year old boys, with hormones coming out of their ears. Bay sells his movie to these kids with a hot Megan Fox (yes, I agree to that. I am still human), shiny robots and a lot of military showing off. You know, I really don't think the locations in the Middle East and Egypt are coincidence. It conditions young minds that the US can fight battles there. I've read that the DoD wants scripts upfront and can say no to producers when they request hardware for their movies. The producers of movies like Jarhead, Full Metal Jacket etc. got no help. Think they said no to this movie? If the propaganda machine of the DoD thinks it's a good film, what do they think is good about it?Judging it purely on it's cinematic merits: it has a lot of explosions and pretty good action scenes, even though I couldn't tell what was going on half of the time. That whiny kid from Suburbia looks like a 30 year old playing an 18 year old and Turturro's comedic timing leaves a lot to be desired. The comic relief scenes are sometimes awkward and again: the story is really thin.I compare this movie and the message in this movie with the prettiest girl in class: She looks fantastic. You can't take your eyes of her. You love her tanned legs, the way her skirt is barely long enough and when she pouts those lips, you just dream away. Just looking at her brings up almost primordial urges inside you. But when you start listening to her and then really looking at her: you will realize she is not that nice, pretty dumb and really a bit dangerous in the way she changes the behavior of the guys around her.",4,2,11,22 December 2010
Man on Fire," Washington still glows, despite Scott's direction
","I was very eager to see this one when I read the synopsis and knew who was involved. After making Revenge and True Romance Tony Scott became one of my favorite directors of the 90's. Add Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken with a hard boiled script by Brian Helgeland and you think you've got a masterpiece on your hands.But it's not. The acting is good all around, as can be expected by veterans like Washington and Walken. But director Scott goes overboard with his MTV-style editing, cutting, blow-ups and close-ups. Scotts direction along with the ending and the fact that the lovestory between Creasy and Lisa was cut out diminishes the film and it's cast. Too bad, this could have been something better.",5,48,90,15 September 2005
Inception," Hard 2 believe is not intellectually or morally challenging
","Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan (writer, producer and director of this movie) is a very, very talented filmmaker. He will undoubtedly make that masterpiece for which he will be remembered. But that's just my point: he hasn't made it yet. The Dark Knight wasn't it and Inception certainly isn't it. Inception is a product of a director who has been given carte blanche. His vision has been put on film without someone ever saying: 'Chris, that's not going to work.' For that matter, Inception should have been Nolan's Heaven's Gate. But Inception will probably make Nolan a even bigger star. He better check his totemÂ… I felt compelled to write a review when I found out this movie had a 9.2 rating and a 3rd place overall in the top 250. Let me say: that is ridiculous. To balance the scale, I have rated this movie (a ridiculous) 1. I agree with some posts on the message board of IMDb: complex does not mean intellectual or smart. And for that matter, I don't think this film is very complex. It just asks what most movies do: go with it.DiCaprio gives a pretty good performance (with leftovers from his role in Shutter Island) as Dobbs, a person who is able the penetrate someone's dream and see or steal his secrets. Recently Dobbs lost his wife and he has not seen his children in a long time. That is because the authorities think he has something to do with his wife's death. Watanabe gives Dobbs a chance to get his life back. He needs to plant an idea (inception) in the mind of a competitor. Like a seed, it will grow. And the inspiration for the idea will seem real.One of the problems for me with the movie was that the dreamworld felt pretty flat and boring to me. Unlike The Matrix (a inception for this movie), the inhabitants of the other world do not bend the rules of gravity. The laws of physics do apply. That's not a bad decision. But I agree with one reviewer: 'Nolan's dreamworld looks like a mediocre action film from the 90's.' The bad guys walk around like video game characters with an AI set on level Easy. I almost shouted in the theater when Eames went Rambo in the snow scene. I understand the decision. Look at The Cell to see how wrong you can go if you explore the subconscious on film. But still, for me his decision to keep the dreamworld neat and clean is a cop out. Dreams don't look like this. Hopes, fears and experiences mix with (the conception of) the real world and you get a pretty original result sometimes. None of this in Inception. Oh right, the architect is in control. How convenientÂ… The whole dream within a dream concept was a little far-fetched for me. Have you ever had one? Probably not. So why, when you have a pretty basic dreamworld go with a concept this unreal? The real world does influence the dream the character's have. But they feel it and are conscious that it is the real world. That's a missed opportunity. A dream influenced by factor's unknown to the dreamer could have made it much more enjoyable for the audience.Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. Like Nolan's former projects The Prestige and The Dark Knight: I don't get all the hoopla. Yes, these movies (like Inception) are well made. They are original, have refreshing ideas, are technically good and have decent scripts. But they are not the best of the decade. And this one really is not a 9.2. I'd say a 5.5. Barely...",1,150,304,4 August 2010
The Good Shepherd," Somewhat miscast, but fascinating none the less
","The Good Sheperd is a massive accomplishment. It's multi layered script incorporates the rise (and rise) of the US intelligence service after WWII. From the early OSS to today's CIA, it tries to shed light on not only the intelligence-counter intelligence game, but also the men and women behind the covert world. The thing that stayed with me after watching this film is that once you enter this world you never leave. And that may sound clichÃ©, it's still unbelievable to me how much the main character is willing to sacrifice in order to keep doing what he thinks he does best.The 'old boys' network is what defined the early days of the OSS and although it's not very explicit in this film, the attentive viewer can get the somewhat elitist way of thinking and acting from these agents/spies. The way of thinking is very important I think, because it defined our recent history.This film is a long time pet-project of DeNiro and I can see why. It has everything in it: suspense, morally challenging, lost love in the 'what if'-category and very good written characters. Top it of with a very good supporting cast and greatness is in it's grasp, but it just falls short of it. I blame the casting of Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie for this.I like Matt Damon in action films. He has the presence for it. Just look at the Bourne-films. But, like Mark Wahlberg, his range is far too narrow to play complicated characters. A remark made in the excellent TV-series Entourage comes to mind: 'You're a movie star, but that does not mean you're a good actor.' Damon should play into his strengths and keep doing action films. Matt Damon is miscast as the silent, somewhat nerdy main character. Damon never finds the right tone of voice, never the right look and never the right rhythm of his character. I am not a fan of Billy Cudrup, but when the two are in the same frame it's a perfect example of an actor totally in sync with his character and one that is not.Just like Alexander, Jolie is also totally miscast in a role that does not suit her. Her greatest strength is her vamp-like attraction with a girlish tenderness (or maybe a hidden vulnerability) that is very, very rare in Hollywood. You have to let her play a role that suits her qualities best and the neglected, stay-at-home mom she plays here is totally unbelievable for me. Her emotional scenes become almost laughable when I think the opposite reaction was intended. I think the role of Laura would have suited her more.Again, I think it's a fantastic film. It's a great accomplishment to make an interesting 2-somewhat hour movie with this much detail and information. The production design, the cinematography, the script and the supporting cast are excellent. For a not so experienced director, DeNiro does a fantastic job because he has made the decision to make the film and not to make 'a Film by Robert DeNiro'. His directing hand is invisible, and this is a hard thing to do when you have all the power. Just take a look at characters in this movie.I give it 8 out of 10.",8,1,2,18 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Another failed attempt to recapture the magic
","In 1999 Star Wars creator George Lucas finally began to give us his view on the events that led to Star Wars IV, V and VI. The first Star Wars trilogy was, as we all know, a milestone in cinema history and it's not easy to top something like that. He didn't succeed to top the original trilogy and although successful commercially, fans weren't all to impressed with the prequels. The story was flat, the characters annoying and the special effects too clean. It could be that this even led to his decision to sell off his Lucasfilm and all the rights to the Star Wars imperium. Disney picked up those rights. Maybe because they thought they could do better. Well, commercially they were right. But better films? Their first installment isn't that impressive. It's worse than The Phantom Menace.Let's get one thing straight: even though it picks up 30 years after Star Wars VI, this is not a sequel. This is a remake. J.J. Abrams tries to get back to the feel of the original trilogy. But essentially copies the storyline of Star Wars IV A New Hope. Okay, so that's disappointing. But let's see where this goes. Abrams then proceeds to give us some awkward comic relief scenes, deep friendships within two minutes of meeting each other and some wooden dialogue. The new bad guy is a spoiled brat who has a tendency for tantrums (and commands the largest army in the galaxy?) and a Supreme Leader who is a hologram. Too make a long story short: I wasn't all too impressed. It's just another failed attempt to recapture the magic of the much loved first three films from the seventies and eighties.Was it all bad? No, off course not. Abrams knows how to direct action and impress with fine special effects. The casting of John Boyega is a courageous move and commercially smart. Too bad that his character comes off as more annoying than brave. Same goes for the character Kylo Ren. That I am not a fan off Adam Driver does not help either. Newcomer Ridley does hit the right tone and impresses as the new lead character. The familiar faces of Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbakka appear, but does that help? They don't bring anything new or fresh. Except for one pivotal scene near the end, which to be fair, was very well done.It's the first installment, maybe it needs to gain momentum. But The Fellowship of the Ring and Star Wars IV were first installments too and they impressed the hell out of people. There are two other films coming in the next years. But this first one just is not all it's hyped up to be.",1,85,130,31 January 2016
Contact," Good, intelligent film that asks relevant questions
","Zemeckis' Contact explores the possibilities of what would happen if we would get a message from intelligent live from outer space. Religion, science, mass hysteria, our way of life. What could happen with it all. What would you do? What would you believe? Contact has a very good script, good actors and great visuals that make the film very believable. The film has special effects, but is not a special effects-film. A mistake many Hollywood-producers make. I think Contact is one of the best films of the 90's.Every film has it's weak points, so does Contact. I didn't go for the obsession that Foster had for finding little green men. She played the part very convincingly though. But I really didn't care why, I was too busy rooting for her and hissing at Skerrit's character.Many people didn't like the ending. I thought it was the only right ending. The most important thing Foster questioned in Contact: faith, was the one thing that she could asked from the people who depended on her. And it's the only thing people have to hold on to.",8,1,3,4 October 2005
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Big, loud and empty
","What else can I say about this, that already hasn't been said? It's big, loud and empty. It's dangerously militaristic and gung ho. Like World Battle: Los Angeles it's a video game with clichÃ© heroism. It's a live action 'I Want You' poster.I really can't fault Bay here. He's an advertising man. He is hired to sell. And he does. Everything is sly, shiny and slick. Nice slow mo's, nice legs (courtesy of some new hottie) and great musclecars. Hormones, heroes and guns. Sign up right here. Do your part and earn citizenship. Oh wait, we're not there...just yet.I fault the viewers who buy a ticket to this. That includes yours truly. Because as long as these things double or triple their budgets, it's still gonna get made. Number 4 is in the making and it's our fault.An awful film that deserves an awful review: 1 out of 10.",1,5,11,26 October 2011
Born on the Fourth of July," Best drama/anti-war film I've ever seen
","Let me come out and tell you that Stone's my favorite director. In the late 80's and early 90's he has made films that will be screened, remembered en studied for a long time. Wall Street, JFK and Born on the Fourth of July are exercises of brilliance in it's prime.In BotFoJ Stone shows us not just the pain of war, but the pain after the war. How does a nation cope with a war it did not want to fight and how does she respect the men and women who made the sacrifices she does not recognize, or at least does not want to know or care about? Stone's direction is fantastic, as is Richardson's cinematography. Stone's films haven't been the same since Richardson went on to become Scorcese's favorite man behind the lens. Cruise is very good, but never looses his pretty boy charisma, which does not help him this time around. Memorable scenes include the war scene's on the dusky beaches of Vietnam and the riots at the universities and the Republican Covention in 1974.Stone is a master of recreating a very important period in US-history. A recreation with a critical eye mind you.",9,2,3,22 July 2005
The Island," Not as bad as I thought
","The reviews for this thing were miserable. This film was the turkey of the summer (box-office wise). But after watching it, I have to say it wasn't as bad as the reviewers made me believe. It's not good, but no more worse than the average Hollywood blockbuster.It's formulaic: that means a male lead, a romantic interest, an evil corporation sending lots a bad men to kill the lead and of course a car chase.I haven't been a fan of Ewan McGregor since he moved to Hollywood. I thought he was perfect in Trainspotting. But whenever I see him in an American film, with his forced American accent, he comes of as inauthentic, unnatural. Thus is the case here. He doesn't bring something extra to the part of Tom Lincon.Johansson is grosly underused. I had the same feeling with Angelina Jolie in 'Gone in 60 seconds'. It's not Johansson's fault she's the damsel in distress for two hours, she's just working with the material she's been given.Bay's direction is as can be expected. Beautifully shot, with hyper-kinetic action. Bay's also one of the few action directors who has an eye for human drama. But he doesn't reinvent himself like most great directors do. His style has been the same since Bad Boys. Too bad, when you're this talented, you have to take a chance and try something else than summer blockbusters.The thing that irritated me was the fact that this film is loaded with product placement. Normally you see one or two brands, but this film has something like 10 brands in bold, shiny letters coming through the screen. I know Bay's background is advertising, but if he wants to make commercials he shouldn't be asking me to pay an admission fee.",6,1,2,13 January 2006
