The Perks of Being a Wallflower," The Perks of Being a Wallflower Review
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower- *** (out of 4): Is the film based off the popular '90s novel a brilliant or distinctive movie? Not really. Is it an interesting, sweet, engaging film? Absolutely. Of course this film is full of clichés at almost every turn: the introvert finding acceptance and love with a group of counter-cultural oddballs. Yes. It is quite a cliché. However, I found the film's depiction of adolescence and its love for its teenage characters enjoyable and sweet. Lerman may be a bit too handsome and smooth for Charley, but once we get started, we don't care. The movie of course would not be half as good without Ezra Miller and Paul Rudd. Both of these actors make this film worthwhile. Anybody who had trouble with high school will like it. Anybody with a heart worth its weight will connect with it. Despite its clichés. Go watch it.",Null,0,1,14 June 2013
Match Point," Match Point Review
","Woody Allen went serious in 2005 with this incredibly serious and tense thriller set in England. That is not to say that Allen has abandoned the themes of his earlier work, about meaning and morality in this world of injustice and chaos. Of course the conclusion of this film is much more pessimistic than that of his others. This is not a whodunit or a crime doesn't pay moral message, this is filmmaking on a more powerful and intensely cynical level. It is a film about injustice and about the fact that crime can pay for people who betray moral values out of greed. Not that it supports this depravity, it states a cold truth, that there is no punishment for the wicked if they manage to fool the people around them. It may not be touchy-feely, but it certainly packs a cold, calculated, but incredibly sexy punch.",8,2,3,25 June 2013
Midnight in Paris," 'Midnight in Paris' Review
","Midnight in Paris- ***1/2 (out of 4): Though I have always prided Woody Allen on sheer wit and philosophical insight, I pride him here for not only the previous areas, but also the originality of his screenplay. What we have here is a commentary on nostalgia, set in the gorgeous city of Paris, taking us between modern day Paris and the city in the 1920s, when artists and writers such as Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein populated the city. The Allen wit is there of course, but the true value of this film is watching Wilson interacting with these famous icons of the past and learning more about the present in the process. It really makes you feel good and think better after you walk out of this film.",Null,0,1,14 June 2013
Catch-22," Catch-22 Review
","Catch-22-** (out of 4): All the components of a great film are there: a brilliant novel by Joseph Heller, Buck Henry in charge of writing, Mike Nichols behind the camera, and a cast any director worth his salt would die for. Of course that all looks good on paper, but it never quite comes together. The black humor of the novel comes out rather awkwardly on the screen, the vignettes not coming together the way they do in the book. The film is a hot mess, a smashing together of Heller's novel into slightly funny scenes that have little flow. Arkin is a great actor, but not the right Yossarian. Arkin is too distinctly New Yorker and looks way too old in the role. Of course Henry's writing does nail certain scenes and the cast is fun to watch, but it is never as great as it should be. It would even be a stretch to say that it is even half-good.",Null,1,4,13 June 2013
Revolutionary Road," Revolutionary Road Review
","If you took Mendes' 'American Beauty', then sucked the contemporary setting and satirical bite out of it, you would get this film he made nearly a decade later. That is not to say that he is overly-repetitious or that this is a bad film by any measure. It is a powerful, well-written movie with two Oscar worthy performances by two stars well-known for their romance on the Titanic. Here they play a couple on the opposite side of the love spectrum, two people growing sick of each other and their plain and boring lives. The drama that results is so realistic and so spastic that it will shock you. The only problem with the movie is its lack of timeliness. This movie would have been revolutionary had it been filmed in the sixties or even in the seventies, but with dozens of suburban angst films proceeding it, 'Revolutionary Road', just like its two main characters is bound to get lost in the shuffle.",7,0,0,5 July 2013
Sinister," Sinister Review
","I have to applaud this film for being a truly original, terrifying, and non-gory horror film. What I like most about it is its build-up and how it sustains suspense to the end instead of petering out like many horror films do. It is consistently scary and suspenseful right up to its shocking finale. It also works as a very surreal film, for not too many details are revealed about 'Mr. Boogie', the menace of this film. It is this lack of awareness on our part which keeps us watching and keeps us interesting. My hat goes off to the screenwriter, who keeps things tense all the way through and you have to appreciate the creepy cinematography and use of score as well.",8,1,3,7 July 2013
The Departed," The Departed
","Scorsese returns to his old form in 'Goodfellas' and Mean Streets' with this tense thriller, about two men who are both moles for the police and mafia, respectively and how their lives crisscross. There is a duality to these characters, they are at once opposite and the same, but working on different ends of the spectrum. This is what creates the tension of the film, not to mention the brutal depictions of mob violence and ethnic nationalism. Scorsese embodies a modern crime thriller here, but explores the same themes of his previous films, such as isolation, redemption, and betrayal. It's exciting and morally relevant, a power punch of a thriller boosted by fine performances from DiCaprio and Nicholson especially.",9,0,0,30 June 2013
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky Cristina Barcelona Review
","Woody Allen made an original drama three years ago in 'Match Point' and he has made yet another one here. Though it contains the typical Woody views on artistic angst and existential qualms, this movie has a fresh and entirely original feel to it. Partially because of the beautiful Barcelona settings and the attractive faces on screen, it is a visual treat to behold. Not only that, but Allen gives a fine portrait of two good friends who find more than expected on vacation. It certainly is little more than fluff, but it is fine, well-made, well-acted fluff at that. It is certainly the sexiest movie Woody has made yet, even succeeding over 'Match Point' three years back.",8,1,2,5 July 2013
The Breakfast Club," The Breakfast Club Review
","The Breakfast Club- **1/2 (out of 4): John Hughes tried a deadly experiment: putting five very different teenagers into a room and seeing what would happen. As feel good as this is, it has its shortcomings and its shortcomings are its undoing. For a filmmaker so concentrated on discovering the truth behind adolescence through realistic depictions, he certainly has a lot of contrived plot lines here. It contrasts itself, the intentions go against the style. Of course that does not mean that it cannot be enjoyed, it is a wonderful picture in an emotional way and anybody who has had the teenage growing pains will definitely relate. From a critical perspective, this is not the best of motion pictures, but from a perspective of a viewer, I would be more than delighted to watch this. It's certainly human.",Null,0,0,16 June 2013
