The Rock," A Great Action Film With Superb Actors
","This is a great action film with some stunning sequences. What makes this different to other films is that the actors are superb and there are some great one-liners. I have seen this film about 10 times and it still is great. It has an unusual setting (Alcatraz)but this also makes the film work. It is directed by Michael Bay (Pearl Harbour,Armageddon) and has his usual comic touches.If you liked this film try seeing Con Air and Face/Off (both starring Nicolas Cage) I really would recommend this brilliant film! 9/10",9,2,2,9 September 2000
Fight Club," The Best Film Ever Made!
","I won't go into the story too much but it is about an insomniac (Edward Norton) who is bored of his life. He then meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and he introduces the insomniac to a new way of life. But this only the beginning to what I think is the best film ever made!. I have now seen it over 10 times and it just gets better and better. This is a film that is better the second time you see than the first because you feel different towards the characters. The film is very original and is very funny. It is also pure genius. I won't say much more but just look out for things on repeated viewings. I didn't think there was that much violence and it is really only one fight that is really bad.The acting is superb, the two male leads Brad Pitt (Seven) and Edward Norton (American History X)really are spectacular! The direction from David Fincher (The Game) is great and the twist at the end I didn't see coming at all. Just watch this film. Some of my friends didn't like the first time but loved it the second time. If you have a DVD player you should check out the excellent 2 disc set. This film will remain in your head for along time because it is so clever and funny. Watch it now and you won't regret it! 10/10",10,0,2,9 September 2000
Billy Elliot," A Brilliant British Film
","I saw a preview of this and knew it had got good write ups, so I was prepared for this excellent film. It has some very funny moments and a very good sound track. The acting is superb along with the direction. Many people told me to take tissues but I did not need them but I could see why you might. I would thoroughly recommend this film. 9/10",9,0,0,30 September 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One Hell Of A Good Film!
",This film is great. The story is very clever and the actors are in fine form. The special effects still look great and the film was made in 1991. They look better than some now a days. It deserved the Oscars it received with the special effects. If you haven't seen go and see it now. The new DVD version of T2 is brilliant. So if you have a DVD player this is one to add to your collection. It contains 3 versions of the film! I just can't wait for Terminator 3 now. But this will pass the time superbly until that comes out. 9/10,9,1,1,25 September 2000
Final Destination," An Excellent Film!
","I had heard mixed reviews about this film but still decided to buy it on DVD(one hell of a DVD which has 3 audio commentaries and alternate ending) and I did not regret it! This film makes you jump, laugh and the deaths are so horrible you feel sorry for the victims. This isn't your usual stalk & slash movie. It is about death not a killer which makes it seem some how original. Whatever you think about the film, it will definitely put you off planes for life! 9/10",9,0,2,4 October 2000
