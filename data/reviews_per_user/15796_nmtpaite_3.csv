It," Doesn't give the Chill that thrills the bone as in Old one
","Honestly, it is a good attempt to remake a classic with full of emotions and rich characters.The old one has build up of characters and the true reason for the survival of the IT.The new is short of characters and acting. The boys here look dumb and careless.One my favorite character was the boy with asthma. Where is this character now?The old one 8/10 while the new one is 5-6/10.",5,0,1,29 October 2017
Oldboy," oldboy .....breathtaking!
","Iam may not be an interesting writer writing about old boy . As i have an engineering academic background , i would like to go down in points about how i feel good on this piece of masterpiece:I) The background music is really enthralling.(that i had split the end part of the movie and convert it into mp3..and yes, i still do listen to it a lot... thinking about the last scene on the snow-covered New Zealand peaks).II)The angles-of-shot were captivating ; and, if i were not mistaken the last scene in the penthouse ..about the 70 steps stuff... was copied by Kill Bill 2 .III) The continuous fight scene in the long corridor...that was a revolutionary idea .IV) The revealing scenes were great...though the causes were minute.Since this movie marked a new era of movie production...i appreciate it a lot... so if any one can't appreciate this movie then either he is a holy child (Godly , not interested in movie) or he is dumb.Some people commented on comparing Tarantino's and Oldboy . But please don't do so..i have seen all Tarantino's and i find them all vague and strange . They are all satirical based .(may be more like SouthPark).But this movie is clear and simple and the fight scenes are more original and better.The only reason that I observe as the drawback is the minute reason for vengeance upon Oh-Daesu.",10,13,96,4 February 2006
Black Panther," Not Good Enough as the Hype
","Did had the chance to watch it on the theater. when the blueray released, i checked it out and watch it with my family.i dont know i didnt like it probably because i was watching it on a 65 inch smaller screen as to theater.its another story where the hero was overthrown and he came back. one man to overthrow the hero's kingdom. the fight scenes are terrible. the CGI was very good though.appreciate 99% of the characters are black. and its probably a very big budget movie starring all blacks. i hope 'inclusions and diversity' is not reason why the hype was created like the way we nominate the Get Out (2017) movie for best picture, director, actor..etc.PS: i am not being racist, i love Denzel and Sidney's movies like hell.",6,1,2,13 May 2018
