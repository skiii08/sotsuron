Blade Runner 2049," Worthy Sequel
","Read the reviews and nearly made the mistake of giving this film a miss, glad I didn't. Dark, atmospheric and thought provoking. Typical of Ridley Scott film. If you prefer wham, bam wallop Sci-fi films in the Marvel mode this may not be for you. Personally, I don't have a problem with either. Would probably put this in the style of Alien, but darker. Length of film is not a problem, went by quickly and would watch again. Some people prefer short films and some of us don't have a problem with lengthy ones. Just comes down to personal preference and attention span.",10,6,13,10 October 2017
