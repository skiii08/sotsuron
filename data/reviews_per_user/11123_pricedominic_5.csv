The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," The best so far? Well, thats not hard!
","I am a person who will go into any film with an open mind, wide eyed and eager in anticipation. When most blokes here about Twilight films, they automatically have the typical bloke response 'I'm not watching that rubbish, too girlie for me.' When i heard about the original Twilight film, i ignored the sceptics, and also ignored the crazy obsessed people who love every movement of R-Patz or Taylor, and i judged it as just another film.The first film was pretty decent. Not a lot happened, but the characters were intriguing, and although Kirsten Stewart was insanely annoying as Bella, it was a watchable film. The series in my opinion has kind of tailed off ever since, with not enough description of what is going on, and not enough action to make it a film worthy of my very demanding viewing time. But, i have persevered, and when someone asked me if i wanted to go see Breaking Dawn part 1, i was interested to see how it ended, or at least how it began to end.I have not read any of the books, i am not a big reader. I am all about the cinematic medium. Like most films that have been copied from books, the story usually does not fit in to a 90-120 minute time frame that it needs to do be a successful film. There are parts in the 2nd and 3rd film, as with this one, where peoples actions aren't really explained to you fully. You only realise it after someone who has read the books tells you the missing parts of the story. But back to this film, i thought it was a step up from the previous two. Although quite jumpy in places, leaping from one plot point to the next far too quickly, i think it had more of a kick to it than others. The scene where she collapses, and the pregnancy scenes are quite gruesome, and stick in the mind vividly. The make up team did a terrific job making her look ill, to the point where it was actually quite disgusting to even look at her (maybe that was just her though, and the make up team didn't do anything! - a joke for all those K-Stew hating girls filled with jealousy.) K-Stew has also found her acting talent in this film.... playing dead. I have never been so convinced that someone is dead, terrific performance of being dead.All jokes aside, if you have seen any of the twilight films or read the books (as everyone in the world seems to have done) then you know what to expect. Lots of tension, moody looks, Vampire and Werewolf fun, and Jacob taking his top off. I am quite surprised at the low rating that this film is receiving here on IMDb, as this film has all the same elements it always has had. In my opinion, some of the scenes are much more memorable, and the acting seems to be getting better with each film that goes by. Maybe Twilight fans are finally starting to realise that it always was a pretty average film, and are expecting too much from its sequels. Either way, i would recommend watching this film, whether you are male or female, or whether you are vampire or werewolf!",6,1,9,6 December 2011
No Strings Attached," the slightly more classier version of Friends with Benefits
","I love Natalie Portman. I love Natalie Portman. I love Natalie Portman. Ever since Closer (for quite obvious reasons) she has had my attention, but she is one of these actors that captivate anyones attention, without ever having to say a word. She truly is one of the most beautiful women on the planet.Now let me stop obsessing over her, and talk about the film No Strings Attached. Adam (played by Ashton Kutcher) has just suffered the humiliation of finding out that his ex girlfriend has dumped him for his own father, and ends up contacting every girl in his phonebook until one of them agrees to have sex with him. This leads him back to an old school friend Emma (Natalie Portman). Although too drunk to go through with his intention in the evening, the morning after he and Emma decide to get it on as there is an instant connection. As Emma is a resident at a nearby hospital so therefore has no time for any kind of relationship, and has a history of not being able to let people get close to her, she decides that a friends with benefits situation is best for her. Adam obviously agrees to this (ermmmm who wouldn't?) and the story leads from there. Obviously if you have watched any Rom-Com in the last 20 years you will know exactly what happens at the end of this film, but i have to say this film definitely has a freshness to it. The supporting cast (including Kevin Kline, Jake M Johnson (New Girl), and the very funny Lake Bell) help to boost the Com part of Rom-Com, which i always feel helps when the Rom part doesn't have anything majorly unique included in the storyline. All in all, a very decent Rom-Com acted by two very attractive actors (yes, even though i am a man, i am confident in myself enough to admit that Ashton Kutcher is annoyingly attractive) If it was a choice between this or Friends with Benefits, i would watch both even though they are pretty much the exact same film. Then again, if you take away the characters and look at the story lines of most Rom-Coms, aren't they all the same story???Thank you for reading :)P.S I love Natalie Portman.",7,1,3,27 February 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Geek Heaven
","Hello everybody who likes to read excellent reviews! well done to you. From the opening credits to the end scene, this film is one of my all time favourite comedies. It is some of Edgar Wright's finest work, it is almost certainly some of Micheal Cera's finest moments, and it really is a change of style to the gross out comedies that seem to have inflicted cinema and TV screens over the past few years. I am not going to bore you with going through the plot, as nobody reads reviews for that, they read them to canvas the viewing audience's opinion. Instead i will merely say this to you.IF YOU WANT TO SEE ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, WATCH THIS.Wow that was a bit much. Anyway, if you are still reading this and haven't been scared off by the angry text i previously displayed, then let me talk you through why you should see this, or more to the point, why I saw this.I missed this whilst it was at the cinema, and wasn't to keen from the reviews i had heard from it. I expected it to be another let down like most comics that have been converted into films (apart from Sin City, love that film.) A few weeks after it had been showing on Sky, my girlfriend at the time said that we should watch this film. As we had just began to start dating, everything was fresh and exciting, and as we could barely keep our hands off each other, this film blended into the background at first. But as i moved my now ex girlfriend aside to focus fully on the film (ohhh maybe thats why i am now single?) i wish i hadn't of wasted all that time at the beginning by heavy petting (yep, definitely why i am now single!) This film is hilarious, in every way a film can be. Excellent fast pacing, with some truly great performances along the way. Micheal Cera is at his best, but also the one liners from Alison Pill (who plays drummer of Sex Bob-omb Kim) are pure comedy gold. Also, the performance of Scott's roommate Wallace (played by Keiran Culkin) is one to watch out for.This film should be watched by everyone on the planet, a pure work of art from everyone involved!",10,4,9,6 December 2011
The Butterfly Effect," Interesting and original
","A conveluted and quite complex plot, written brilliantly and acted very well indeed by Ashton and his co workers. I state 'Ashton and his co workers', because this really is Ashton Kutcher at his best. The support cast are credible, but at a time when Kutcher was trying to break away from his fun but forgettable roles such as Dude Wheres my Car, and his stint on Punked, this film couldn't have been any better. This is definitely a film you need to concentrate on for every minute, as one moment of the story you miss, may lose you in the following events that occur. I have seen many films that use time travel as a plot line, and i have seen many fail because of it. But this film gets it bang on, and by the end you are really anticipating how Evan will sort the whole mess out to make everyone happy, because if you shred away the many layers of this film all he is trying to do is exactly that, bring happiness to people who only know despair. i would love to see Ashton Kutcher in similar roles to this, as i feel his career has begun to tail off into mondane and mediochre rom-coms. A truly great film, very underrated and very understated.On another note, DO NOT WATCH THE SECOND ONE. It is the biggest smack in the face to any film franchise, completely loses the whole ideology of this film, and becomes a poorly acted farce.P.S Very clever use of character name Evan Treborn. Say it as one word and you will understand why :)",9,2,2,30 January 2012
Big Fish," Escapism Personified
","This truly great tale follows the life of a young Edward Bloom (played by Ewan Mcgregor) growing up in the very small town of Spectre. His adventures are brought to us from a much older Edward(played by the excellent Albert Finney) as he regails his stories to his now grown up son Will Bloom, and his wife played by Marion Cotillard. As you can imagine from any Tim Burton film, the bulk of the story is set in an imaginary world filled with interestingly brilliant characters. But the centre of the story is Edward Blooms son trying to connect with his father, trying to determine fact between fiction. This film is definitely one of my all time favourites. It is a film that should be on everyones 'films to watch before you die' list. I feel with some Tim Burton films, he gets lost in trying to create these amazingly detailed worlds of his, but this film he really finds the perfect balance between the story and the setting. I would recommend that everyone watch this film, even if you are not a big fan of the actors in it, or the director himself. A perfect film to forget about your troubles, and get lost in Burton's vision of the world. I would also suggest that anyone who watches it, then listens to the song 'How i go' by the band yellowcard. Perfect song, for a near perfect film.",10,0,0,30 January 2012
