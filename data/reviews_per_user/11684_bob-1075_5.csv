Scarface," A landmark film of the 1980's
","'Say hello to my little friend!'- one of the great Al Pacino quotes. I watched this film last night for the first time in years. It is brutal, it is horrible in places. But is is very well written, the action is brilliantly filmed and the acting superb.Al Pacino must have truly loved the script - you can see him having fun with the Cuban accent on different words like 'cock-a-roach'. Also he has something in his eyes that betrays the 'assassin' that is Tony Montana. Also, for all his violence - you cannot help liking the anti-hero.This film also stars a young Michelle Pfieffer and F Murray Abraham. As gangster films go - this one often gets forgotten but for me it stands up with Carlitos Way, LA Confidential, The Godfather pt 1 and Goodfellas as one of the top 5. Great entertainment.",9,0,1,12 January 2006
Casablanca," The Greatest
","What makes Casablanca the greatest?The detail. After Ugate is arrested Rick moves forward and picks up a small glass that has fallen over. When Sam is playing 'As Time Goes by' and Rick is drinking to forget (the famous scene) he involuntarily moans from within. He shows the man's heartbreak - the reactions of emotion running through a body broken by booze and sorrow.This is acting and film making at it's very finest.The inner decency of Rick is moving as is Ingrid Bergmann's tear filled eyes - but the throat catcher is the singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne's impassioned 'Vive La France!' This was war time, and the film makes us remember what it was all for. Hollywood should look at the script - how simply it is constructed - and learn - there is a public worldwide that wants scripts of this quality about real people.",Null,13,20,20 July 2004
Troy," Achilles must be turning in his grave
",How any one can see this as a great film is beyond me.1) factually completely inaccurate 2) script sounded like it was written for 5 year olds - except Peter O Toole 3) Acting all terrible except Eric Bana and Peter O Toole - both wasted. 4) Battle scenes - wasted opportunity - totally unrealistic.They should have given it to Ridley Scott. Brad Pitt - someone needs to have a word with him - or he should employ his own writers to redevelop the scripts he gets sent.He should also enunciate his words more clearly - he mumbles - a nightmare for the actor - and the audience.When writing these films why don't they consult experts? The LOTR trilogy shows that audiences will accept stylised dialogue - nothing is more stylised than ancient texts - why modernise it?A wasted opportunity - for how much money???,Null,2,4,5 July 2004
Lost in Translation," Time Slip
","This film is reminiscent of films made in the forties and fifties.We don't like films that make us think. We don't like films without sex or violence. We don't like films that show actors as losers with unhappy lives. We don't like unhappy endings or endings we don't understand.Tough. Life is like that. We struggle with our relationships to make any sense of them - whether we understand languages, body language, looks, signs. Sophia Coppolla has had too much bad press over the years just because of her dad. She threatens us because she's female, intelligent and wealthy. Well good luck to her - she should become as great a film maker as her father - I just hope our unsophisticated society doesn't relegate her to the art house.This film will be a classic in 20 years time because it is a rarity - a good script.",8,0,1,5 July 2004
Casino Royale," Pretty Good
","Firstly I must say that this film has been greatly over-hyped. But having said that it is very entertaining. The plot is highly unlikely and very far fetched but then which Bond film isn't? The difference here is the lazy charm and cold violence of 007. We must not forget that Bond is an assassin (you don't get a licence to kill for nothing) and lately he has been reduced to a a swarve, middle aged commando. Craig makes him something human, direct and brutal. He is slightly cold but not without a humorous streak - usually at his own expense. Very hard to judge him as a new Bond - because he is so unlike any previous Bond. But the fight scenes, chases and general pace keep up the interest. It's a good escape for 2 hours. It would actually be an interesting exercise to re-visit the original books and re-make them as Fleming wrote them. With today's technology we could even set them in the fifties and sixties - now that would be a challenge! - and Craig is probably the man to carry it off,",8,2,4,20 November 2006
