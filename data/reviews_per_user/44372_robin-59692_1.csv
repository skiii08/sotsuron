First Man," Worst biopic I've ever seen
","From the start of this movie, yes, the opening scene, it had a weird mood and disturbing camera angles (which continued throughout the movie) that I found completely distasteful. It was an extremely choppy movie within scenes and from scene to scene. There was a complete lack of interesting script, scene sets and lackluster acting. Yes, Ryan Gosling couldn't even make this movie worth watching. Hey Mr. Screenwriter, give me some levity or something! Geez. These people did not seem relatable. I do not recall a single character genuinely smiling. If I can't be interested in the story or any of the characters within the first 30 minutes then I know i am watching a bad movie. I fell asleep during it then turned it off - not worth finishing. I am very disappointed in this project but hugely pleased that I did not go to the local movie theater and pay a high price to waste my time. #fridaynightruined",1,3,6,26 January 2019
