The Monuments Men," Bad, Very bad, Awful, Sad!!!
","This is my first review but I just had to write it. This movie shows to the whole world why USA will always be thought of as arrogant and uncooperative nation. It shows the worst of the gigantic Ego that the whole American culture is trying to build in all of its citizens. It is a great shock to see how American soldiers are trying to 'save' historical objects and pieces of art from the Russians. How they even mock them by leaving them only the American flag. To mock the country and the people that lost 28 million people during that war is shameful, no, it is disgusting. To try to show Russian soldiers as robbers is disgusting. And please, don't be surprised when every Russian that watches this movie hates USA until the rest of his life. Remember, you reap what you sow...",1,3,6,8 May 2014
