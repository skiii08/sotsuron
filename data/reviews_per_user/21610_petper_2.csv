The Monuments Men," Never let actors direct movies
","We have seen much more than enough of George Clooney. And when he also acts as a movie director it gets even worse. Doesn't the U.S.A. have more than ca. 10 actors? I am tired of seeing Clooney, Travolta, Cruise etc. in every movie.In this movie the actors seem to have lost their enthusiasm and professionalism already before the movie starts.And why use an English actor (Cate Blanchett) to play a French woman? Aren't there any French actresses?This movie must be one of the worst directed in modern history. Mr Clooney should refrain from other duties than acting. And he looks, talks and acts the same in every movie, so why not try to find someone with better acting skills.",1,2,3,14 June 2015
Unbroken," Actor as Director
",It is seldom an Actor is good as a Producer. Clint Eastwood may be one of the few exceptions. Actors should remain in their profession insetad of destroying a good story. So please Angelina - don't produce any more films.,2,2,4,27 March 2019
