Requiem for a Dream," 10 out of 10
","WOW! as a huge fan of hubert selby´s writing I was somehow scared that they mess it up. but with THAT director and THAT cast, what can go wrong? right, nothing, and that´s why REQUIEM FOR A DREAM sits right up there with other masterpieces of the last decade like BAD LIEUTENANT, CLEAN SHAVEN, JULIEN DONKEY BOY, SEUL CONTRE TOUS, THE WAR ZONE, GUMMO etcetc...all movies that actually dare not only to touch sensitive subjects but actually DEAL with them. that´s a big difference. so, kudos to mr. aronovsky who had the guts to make this movie as unpleasant as it should be. no safety nets, every trace of hope or happiness is immediately crushed by aronovsky´s sense for reality. and ellen burstyn gives one hell of a mindblowing performance. see it and weap!",Null,0,1,10 August 2002
Scary Movie 2," an 85 minutes fart joke
","this is easily the worst movie I´ve seen in decades, and believe me I had my share. everytime you think it can´t get any worse it runs an extra-mile to show how degenerated 'humour' can get. this is definetly not a question of taste, it´s one of character, and I sure don´t want to sit next to a guy who likes THAT. 85 minutes wasted on feces, vomit, urine etcetc...thanks, wayans.",Null,2,3,6 August 2002
American Psycho," total let-down
","the book was brilliant, a great yet misunderstood satire. it was hilarious, violent and terribly boring at times, but always intense. when I heard that oliver stone or david cronenberg were supposed to do the job I thought 'wow, that´s gonna be a great adaption.' but, alas, mary harron took over and crashed the car right into the tree. christian bale gave a decent performance as bateman but under harron´s direction he´s too often a ridicilous jester rather than a frightening serial killer. harron mellowed everything out, watered it down, and I´m not talking about gore here. and the scene with the chainsaw was one of the most laughable scenes I´ve seen in years. but the supporting cast ( sevigny, dafoe, leto ) were pretty good. all in all I say: skip that!",Null,1,2,10 August 2002
