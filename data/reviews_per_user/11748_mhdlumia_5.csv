Hereditary," Is there a more worse/intense word than Disturbing!?
","Utterly hideous, desecrating and most unclean!!. I've watched tons of Horror movies thus I know when to appreciate a really good one such as Conjuring, but this right here excels in delivering disturbance and moral disgust; it utilizes well-made scare scenes and suspense moments to keep the viewer glued to the screen. It crosses numerous red lines and leaves you at the end with nothing but a 'Duck this piece of Crap!' attitude.",3,2,8,20 October 2018
Passengers," A top notch 'will watch it many times' kind of movie
","Why the heck haven't I watched this before!?. Let me just start by saying it's so damn beautiful and satisfying to the eye with all its state of the art CGI and visual effects. Secondly, since only three or four characters were presented throughout the whole movie we as viewers had the fulfilling opportunity to care deeply for each and everyone.. Now I reach the good stuff; It's one of the greatest/purest Love stories I've ever witnessed in a movie. At the beginning the main character 'Jim Preston' arguably commits an unspeakable act, a really bad thing which concerns the other main character 'Aurora Lane', however he's only human. And as the story progresses it turns out that what he did brought two passionate hearts together only to join and form an unmatched power. His outrageous decision revived her soul and gave her the best version of a life which she never remotely expected, a life that only existed in her wildest dreams, A one Hell of a Life !",10,0,2,19 November 2018
Oblivion," It's all over the place
","The story is somewhat original and there's a good twist, however, the movie hardly makes it through with Tom's great acting. In the beginning the build up of the story was solid, and each of the main characters got its share of attention to make you care for it, but everything suddenly got shattered in the middle of the movie and becoming overwhelmingly confused is the least i could say to describe my emotions from that moment forward, then it became a huge puzzle which needed a big time deciphering. towards the end the whole confused thing and the continuous 'Whaaaaat!?' expression starts to unravel leaving you with a complete picture of everything that was going on, but then you're left with this statement 'It could have gone better', and don't let me get started with the bad guy's boss who was a complete joke. bottom line : this is not one of Tom's best movies.",5,0,2,29 August 2015
Inception," I checked the dictionary to see if there's a more extreme synonym for WOW!
","Exquisitely intricate, unequivocally unique, ingeniously contrived, exceedingly tingling, overwhelmingly captivating, imperfectly perfect and absolutely BEAUTIFUL !!!
It's not the best one I've watched, but it's definitely going to the TOP 5 list.",10,0,2,4 December 2018
Arrival," For the Love of God !
","Just like 'The Girl on the train' and 'Interstellar' ; You eventually interpret it, decipher its damn Morse code and get the whole mumbly jumbly Idea behind it, plus you have your fair share of mmm I see!!. But it's just a waste of Brain energy load of Crap.",2,4,14,28 July 2018
