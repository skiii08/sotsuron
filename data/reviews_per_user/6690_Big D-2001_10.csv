The Blair Witch Project," The most terrifying motion picture event of the century.
","Even after the substantial amount of hype surrounding this film before it was released nationwide, I still find this the scariest film I have ever seen.  The concept was fresh and original: a group of college kids hiking through the woods looking for clues as to the legend of the Blair Witch, shot as a documentary.  From what I hear, the story and myth was a fabrication of the directors and the actors improvised the majority of the film.  Even after knowing all that, it was still an extraordinarily effective horror film.  The realism of the picture is what heightened the intensity.  The absence of a suspenseful score, 'fake' scares and even a visible villain brought it above the recent 'Scream'-style genre invading cineplexes today.  The most effective special effect 'The Blair Witch Project' uses is the audience's imagination.  Our imaginations are so wild and vivid; it taps into our worst nightmare in various moments of the film. What I have learned as a child is that the noise in the dark is, usually, ten times scarier than what makes the noise in the dark.  The performances were realistic and very emotional.  The three actors displayed the most impressive improvisation I have ever witnessed.  Heather Donahue gives an emotional and powerful performance, one of the best performances by an actress of the year.  Also, the ending is one of the most hair-raising climaxes ever put on film.  My heart was racing until its abrupt end, leaving me a very satisfied customer.  See this film while it's still playing on the big screen; trust me, it's worth it.  Or you can wait until it debuts on video October 26th.  Either way, experience the most terrifying motion picture of the century.",Null,1,1,2 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I'll let my comment speak for itself.
","I'm sure you've heard everything there is to know about Star Wars, all its sequels, and its upcoming two new additions. We're all aware of such a big fan base surrounding the force. But does anyone realize that there are anti-Star Wars people out there? I hate it!  I hate it!  STOP going on and on and on and on about it !  My brain is about to explode.... It pollutes everything we see!!! You can't step on a bus, look at a bill board, walk into KFC or Burger King, watch TV, listen to the radio, look out your bedroom window, talk to your friends, talk to your enemies, visit your family, or even sling on your pants without seeing the bloody Episode One merchandise!!!  Don't you see what they're doing??  They're zapping us with their little merchandising ray-guns, polluting our minds that one viewing is never enough   May the force be with you???? WE'RE NEVER WITHOUT IT!  Make these demons go away !!!! You're all powerless.... we must join a revolution, oh brothers and sisters! We WILL beat the force...sure, there will be some casualties....it took away some very good colleagues of mine...zapped their brains and made them queue hours and hours outside the movie theatre.... but.... we will succeed if we fight.  START THE REVOLUTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (P.S. The effects were pretty good.)",Null,0,1,4 November 1999
Fight Club," A fun, energetic and exhilarating motion picture experience from one of the most ambitious directors to come out in the 90s...
","Once in a while, there is a film that is so over-the-top and outlandish, that you don't have any other choice but to sit there and relish in all its greatness.  Such a film is `Fight Club,' the second best film of the year. It is a fun, energetic and exhilarating motion picture experience from one of the most ambitious directors to come out in the 90s. 
Like `American Beauty,' this year's best film, `Fight Club' makes the audience look within themselves and really ponder our existence, our place in the world, our inevitable fate and all those hours in between.  The difference between the two films is that `American Beauty' takes a somber route and leaves certain elements to be pondered afterwards, whereas with `Fight Club,' the audience is pounded over the head with a sledgehammer with its thematic message.This is David Fincher's fourth Hollywood picture.  In 1992, he gave America one of the best-looking bad movies ever, Alien 3.  He made his mark in 1995 with the intense, disturbing and intelligent psychological film, `Seven,' which is the best thriller of the 90s.  Then in 1997, Fincher collaborated with Michael Douglas for the mind-bending `The Game.'  `Seven' is one of the best films I have ever seen; whether I love `Fight Club' more is still in question.The performances were flawless across the board.  Edward Norton gives, yet, another powerful performance as the Narrator.  This is his third best performance, after `American History X' and `Primal Fear.'  Brad Pitt, a fine, underrated actor, is right at home here.  He was also the star of `Seven' and here is another well-balanced role.  I haven't seen many films with Helena Bonham Cater.  I know she usually does English films, and I admired her choices she made for the role.  In this film, she has made me want to rent some of her earlier works.The whole Fincher-look to the film (yes, he has a look) complimented the story, the actors and the grittiness.  This is a very violent film, containing some of the most violent sequences I have ever seen.  The camerawork and cinematography was beautiful.  There were some really wonderful shots in `Fight Club,' such as the camera moving through the contents of a garbage can.`Fight Club' is, definitely, a guilty pleasure.  The film is violent and darkly comic.  There are moments where you may feel bad for laughing, but who cares?  It's just a movie.  At two-and-a-half hours long, this movie moves pretty quickly, in my opinion.  The mega-twist ending comes out of left field and a very unexpected time; at first, it seems very contrived. It makes the entire film experience take a much different direction than you would have anticipated.  You will not be able to predict this film and that is one of its greatest achievements.  This is the second best film of the year, after `American Beauty.'  See both films, back-to-back, with a friend and you'll have one of the most engaging conversations about life, your place in the world and your fate.",Null,0,1,21 October 1999
Sleepy Hollow," One of the year's best...
","Tim Burton's `Sleepy Hollow' is a truly fun experience.  This film is beautifully shot and directed, the score by Danny Elfman was incredible (as usual) and Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances of his career.This is Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's third collaboration together after `Edward Scissorhands' and `Ed Wood.'  Their films get better and better with `Sleepy Hollow' being the best of the three.  The film is atmospheric, giving it a new dimension; it's one of the best-looking horror films I have ever seen.  The use of color, contrast and how they reflect off the costumes of the characters are used effectively.  As before, Johnny Depp gives a masterful performance.  He is one of our generation's best actors.  He is well known for his contrasting roles and his vigorous research for each. His best performances include `Donnie Brasco,' `Ed Wood,' `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,' even though I hated the movie, and `What's Eating Gilbert Grape?'  I have forgiven him for his cardboard performance in this fall's `The Astronaut's Wife,' which the film, more or less, belonged only to Charlize Theron.  There were many moments in `Sleepy Hollow' where he is truly funny.  His facial expressions are priceless and excellent across the board.I will say that Christina Ricci is a very talented actress.  She proved she is not just the girl from `The Addams Family' by moving to more adult roles in `The Ice Storm,' `The Opposite of Sex,' `Buffalo Â‘66' and `Pecker.'  She is one of the best young actresses working today, but her character is somewhat underwritten and caricatured.  She did the best she could with it and she was just fine, but I felt Andrew Kevin Walker (writer of `Seven') could have gone further with her character. Anyhoo, this film has some great special effects and very exciting and very gory death scenes.  It's so bloody that's it's almost funny.  There was a great deal of comedy in this film, particularly with Johnny Depp's character.  He was such a conservative and upright citizen that no one other than Depp could have played it.  This is one of the year's most exciting and exhilarating films.",Null,0,0,22 November 1999
Notting Hill," One the best romantic comedies in recent years.
","As it appears, Julia Roberts is to romantic comedies as Robert De Niro is to playing gangsters and starring in Martin Scorcese pictures.  'Notting Hill' is one the best romantic comedies in recent years.  It is sweet, romantic and very funny.  Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant have great chemistry throughout the film.  The film's supporting characters, Hugh Grant's character's roommate and his sister, steal the show from its more popular leads.  This is such an engaging story that shows you don't have to have explosions, threatening asteroids and/or a $100 million + budget to have a great motion picture.  'The year's best romantic comedy' title, most definitely, belongs to 'Notting Hill.'",Null,0,0,2 September 1999
American Pie," The funniest comedy in years has finally arrived!
","Yes, 'American Pie' is a tasteless, disgusting, raunchy and obscene, but it's also sweet and F***ING HILARIOUS!  This film has been called a teenage version of 'There's Something About Mary.'  However, I feel it exceeds 'There's Something About Mary' simply because there were much more individually funny moments than 'Mary.'  Sure, the 'hair gel' scene in 'Mary' made me fall out of my chair in the theatres, but those laughs were few and far between.  In 'American Pie,' moments like that flooded of the screen into the back of the theatre.  The distinct difference between 'American Pie' and 'There's Something About Mary' is that you can be along and still laugh hysterically at 'Pie,' whereas with 'Mary,' you have to feed off an audience's reaction to what is happening on screen.  'American Pie' is the best and funniest teen film ever.  It is hilarious, sweet and so much fun all at once.  I will never be able to watch 'Buffy, The Vampire Slayer' the same again and not think, 'Say My Name, B****!'  Those who have seen the movie already know what I am talking about.",Null,0,0,2 September 1999
American Beauty," 1999's best film and one of the century's best...
","'American Beauty' is one of the finest films ever made.  It is masterful in plot, story, character structure and development, dialogue, set-up and payoff.  The performances are the pinnacles of everyone's careers. Hopefully, this will be next year's Oscar gem.Kevin Spacey deserves his second Oscar for his performance as Lester Burnham.  Spacey is an actor who lets his character's through-line carry him through the story and it works beautifully.  Spacey is one of the greatest actors of our generation and shows how he can preserve a role and let it develop the actor.Annette Bening is at the top of her form as Carolyn Burnham.  This is among her best work, including 'The American President' and 'The Grifters.'  She carries her own weight against powerful Spacey and they play their scenes well with the perfect amount of cynicism and malice.I remember the first film I saw 17-year-old Thora Birch was 'All I Want For Christmas' back in 1991 when she was 9 years old.  She has done various supporting roles since in 'Patriot Games,' 'Clear And Present Danger' and 'Now And Then,' to name a few.  She has never made such an impression on me as she has as Jane Burnham.  She has developed immensely as an actress and her maturity, mentally and physically, works well for here in this part. She seems to be one of those rare child actors, like Drew Barrymore, that's slowly making a transition from child-to-adult roles.Newcomer Wes Bentley, 21, plays next-door neighbor Ricky Fitts, n one of the film's most difficult and challenging roles.  Bentley makes a very sympathetic character, despite what he feels real beauty is (i.e., dead pigeon, plastic bag blowing in the wind).  We, the audience, feel for him because of his heated relationship with his father, his deep appreciation for Thora Birch's character and his loneliness, which lurks within all of us.  He has very nice chemistry with Thora Birch that's always interesting to watch; he's an intense star in the making and I hope to see more of him.Mena Suvari, 20, makes an intriguing and provocative career move as Angela Hayes soon after recently playing 'Choir Girl' in this summer's hilarious teen comedy, 'American Pie.'  At first, it appears all her character must do throughout is act bitchy and seductive, but her last scene in the film signifies how good she was.  She plays a cheerleader, who tries to seduce Spacey to reassure herself that she's attractive and above ordinary. I'm sure many of us, including myself, have felt that way before.Last, but not least, Chris Cooper rounds out this wonderful ensemble cast as the stern, militant father of Ricky who has a few hidden secrets of his own. I have known Chris Cooper to be a great supporting character actor and here is no exception.  By the end, we understand the reasons for his actions, even though we, most certainly, don't agree with the resulting outcome.Every main character in this film is rather over-the-top, but they were played with such skill, style and finesse that it makes them believable all the same.  We sympathize with Lester because we sense his discomfort and rediscovery all the way to his inevitable downfall.  I understand why this 42-year-old man will fall for a 17-year-old girl.  Of course, there are many reasons why it's wrong, but Lester doesn't so much love her, but the idea of her.  There are no real villains in `American Beauty' and there doesn't have to be. It's not impossible to see Lester using Angela as an outlet to become more spiritually aware.This film has `psychology' written all over it.  Screenwriter Alan Ball has done a masterful job with his dialogue, character development and his view of `contemporary' American life and its `mask.'  These characters are definitely stuck in `The Matrix.'  Director Sam Mendes has an extraordinary visual style that translates to the screen with beautiful, vibrant colors and set design.  He, also, knows the irony and satirical tone each scene hints at and requires.The film has elements of other recent pictures, such as `Happiness,' `The Ice Storm' and a little bit of `Office Space.'  Those were three well-made films, yet `American Beauty' exceeds all three combined.  `American Beauty' is an exceptional exercise of the right actors with the right script at the right time.  It is the year's best film so far, passing `The Sixth Sense,' even though both films have very little in common.  The film's closing credits appeared and numerous couples sat in silence, staring at the screen and taking in the experience.  When I went into the theatre parking lot, I watched an empty styrofoam cup flailing about in the breeze.  Right then, I understood what Ricky Fitts meant by beauty.  One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen is `American Beauty.'",Null,0,0,5 October 1999
Being John Malkovich," One of the most original films ever made.
","This is definitely one of the most original films ever created. The whole concept was bizarre and surreal, but it make the journey all the more enjoyable. The script, by Charlie Kaufman, is quirky and hilarious but what the film has most going for it is the element of surprise: you never know what will happen next. The performances were wonderful across the board with an extremely talented cast playing roles against type.John Cusack has made the biggest stretch he's made as an actor in a very long time. He downplayed his usual wise-cracking persona to play a more subtle and pathetic character. Great acting choice. If I didn't know Cameron Diaz was in the film beforehand, I would have had a hard time recognizing her. She was looking like bottom-of-the-barrel trailer trash throughout the movie and this is the best performance I have seen from her. I was never truly impressed with her as an actress before but my head was turned here and I hope to see more of this caliber from her. I have been a big fan of Catherine Keener since 'Living In Oblivion' and she has further impressed me in 'Walking & Talking,' 'The Real Blonde' and 'Your Friends & Neighbors.' She is a wonderful actress with a spunky, hard-edged and sarcastic presence that is unavailable to most actresses working in Hollywood today. Let us not forget John Malkovich, himself, for another great performance here. He, as Julia Roberts did in 'Notting Hill,' shows that he is not just playing a caricature of himself, but someone is his position with depth and ambiguity that, I imagine, is much different that himself.The director, Spike Jonze, has recently starred in 'Three Kings.' By looks alone, you couldn't tell that he would bring to life such an extraordinary motion picture. This material, had it been in other hands, may not have been successful. It was handled with the right amount of comedy and surrealism. I hope this film is nominated for Best Picture next year.",Null,0,0,28 November 1999
The Sixth Sense," The year's best film so far...
","This is, by far, the year's best film to date: a very intense and emotional psychological thriller about a young boy who sees ghosts and the child psychologist who tries to reach him.  Bruce Willis gives his best performance of his career.  In my opinion, he's quite worthy of an Oscar nomination, but he'll never get one.  He'll be lucky if he gets a Golden Globe nomination.  The real treasure of the film is Haley Joel Osment.  He gives the greatest child performance I have ever seen.  It would be a travesty if he doesn't win Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards next year.  Osment's performance makes me, as a theatre-acting major at University Of Illinois, feel envious of him, which I feel is a pathetic emotion.  The writing and direction is flawless.  The pacing is slow, but slow for a reason.  We get a real sense of the characters and the situation and it makes us care about every one of them and their outcome.  The ending, as many have said, is shocking and very effective.  Nothing can prepare you for it; it's the best climax since, should I say, 'The Usual Suspects.' The ending makes you look at the film in an entirely different prospective and that is one of the film's greatest achievements.  I highly recommend this chilling and haunting tale and should be remembered as a classic ghost story.",Null,0,0,2 September 1999
The Matrix," The most entertaining and energetic action adventure of the 90's.
","'The Matrix' is, without a doubt, the most entertaining and energetic action adventure of the 90's.  The action sequences are absolutely mind-blowing and inventive.  It is, in a word, AWESOME.  And now, a few words of discomfort. This film has major loopholes in the plot.  It left so many questions and possibilities open-ended.  The film drags for about an hour while the characters go through and explain the plot.  Keanu Reeves is NOT the greatest actor on the planet, and, at a crucial moment in the movie, it abandons its potential in plotting and becomes a standard action picture. But, you know what?  I really didn't care.  Once again, the action sequences and special effects are top-notch and involving.  I give major credit to the film's directors, whose previous outing 'Bound,' was much heavier in plot, character development and pay-off; a much more superior motion picture. The film is still playing in second-run theatres and will be out on video September 21st.  Buy the DVD for extra 'goodies' about the production and a running audio commentary by the filmmakers.",Null,0,1,2 September 1999
