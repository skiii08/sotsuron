Hereditary," I agree with the hype
","I saw this at an advance screening because I'd been hearing so much praise about it and how frightening it was. It was somewhat reminiscent of 'Rosemary's Baby,' and for three or four days after I saw it little plot details finally slid into place in my head and it made the film even more disturbing. I think in order to really 'get' this film it would mean going back and seeing it a second time.There are some truly horrifying scenes in 'Hereditary,' and it progresses from a story about family grief into a manic nightmare; it also takes on a grim, almost depressing tone sometimes in its exploration of mental illness and dysfunctional family dynamics. There's a feeling of dread throughout the film that's hard to shake, very much like 'The Babadook.' Toni Collette again proves she's one of finest actresses around today and her performance in this is an incredible tour de force that should be taken seriously when awards season comes around. She's truly an amazing presence in this film, and some of her scenes are so emotionally charged that you can see her expressing one emotion on top of another. All the performances are excellent (especially Ann Dowd and Alex Wolff), but it's Collette that carries the film to it's finale.Basically the message of the film seems to be when you grow up with a monster of a mother, the experience stays with you the rest of your life. Ari Aster's filmography seems to highlight family and mother-son themes, and it'll be interesting to see where he goes after 'Hereditary.' It's a brave attempt to create an intelligent, unique horror film, and for that alone I really enjoyed it.",9,5,13,8 June 2018
Monster," Strong stuff, but...
","I saw this last night and I have to agree with Greg's comments above. I thought it was powerful and disturbing (it stuck with me today, which films rarely do), but after awhile the makeup job felt a little gimmicky. Despite a great performance, I found myself wondering through most of the movie if the actual makeup was doing the acting (the frowning, downturned expression Wuornos often had), or Ms. Theron was.  It also seemed like the film did very little to explain why Shelby would be attracted to a character disorder like Aileen Wuornos and would continue to live in such obvious denial throughout their relationship.I saw 'AW: The Selling of a Serial Killer' several years ago and the real woman struck me as a sociopath with very little insight or remorse for why she killed... she was a complex, tortured personality who appeared to have very little control over her rages and her impulse control.  Was she a victim?  Of course she was... but the film would have been so much more if it had pointed out that she was a woman who wouldn't take responsibility for her past and chose to be destructive.  I think there has been a dangerous trend in American movies for several decades now that emphathizes with criminals by providing a simple, kind of 'tied up in a ribbon' history that turns them into heroes (or is that anti-heroes?). Personalities (or personality disorders) just aren't put together that simply.  The scene in 'Monster' where AW rationalizes ('people are killed every day') her crimes to her partner was probably the most chilling aspect of this film and was so perfectly written that it was frightening (I will tell you that I work with sociopaths in my profession every day, and that scene could have been recorded word-for-word from one of them).In any case, what I thought was unmistakable about the film was that it took some guts to make it and it didn't apologise, and for that I think it should be congratulated.  I've stopped watching most American movies because they seem as though they've been put together in a factory and don't want to take risks for fear of losing money at the box office.  Despite what I thought were some flaws, this one did take risks and was pretty bold about it.",Null,0,0,2 January 2004
The Babadook," Wow, great movie!
","This is a whopper of a horror film. The performances by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman as the mother and son were so authentic I was pulled way into the plot within the first 10-15 minutes. Watching Davis' gradual descent into madness (or was it?) was very reminiscent of Polanski's 'Repulsion,' however I felt this film was much more effective. 'The Babadook' goes into some taboo territories that I've never seen explored in a movie before, and at times it almost becomes unbearable to watch. There is an atmosphere of uneasiness throughout most of its running time. I really hope this gets a formal U.S. release, it's one of the most original as well as one of the creepiest films I've ever seen. Reading Jennifer Kent's filmography, it looks as though she hasn't done a lot of directing; hopefully after the success of this we'll see more of her work.",9,13,28,2 November 2014
Us," Way too complicated
","Just like 'Get Out,' I eagerly waited to see this but then walked out of the theater this afternoon scratching my head when it was over. Unlike some of the reviewers here I can't say I was disappointed, as I thought so much of the film was well done. First and foremost it's a horror movie , and Jordan Peele really knows how to build terror and some great suspense (as an example, there's a horrifying scene in which a family is matter-of-factly massacred to a Beach Boys soundtrack that was masterfully done). The problem is that the plot and logic of 'Us' became so complicated and convoluted that I stopped trying to follow it halfway through the film. In fact, I just read an explanation of the ending on the Digital Spy website and I seriously doubt most people will be able to figure it out... there are way too many details that aren't spelled out very well during the film's running time, many of them unnecessary.'Us' reminded me of an updated version of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' with references to other horror films like 'The Birds' and 'The Purge' thrown in. There's also a humorous wink to a part of the plot early in the film by a scene with a videotape of 'C.H.U.D.' in the foreground.Lupita Nyong'o gives an incredible performance and carries a lot of the film, as well as Winston Duke, Shahadi Wright Joseph and Evan Alex.I hope Jordan Peele continues to make horror films, because I think he has the skills to make a great one; but when the audience is so distracted by trying to understand what's actually happening and why, the film loses a lot of its impact. 'Us' seemed to me to be a series of well-directed scenes but I couldn't tie them all up at the end so they made sense and I felt kind of cheated by that.",5,10,20,23 March 2019
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Andy Samberg made this?!
","Andy Samberg is a funny guy. I've always enjoyed his Lonely Island videos on Saturday Night Live and I like the fact that he gets outrageous and over the top. This movie is absolutely terrible, and I really looked forward to seeing it. It's not funny in the least, it's incredibly pedestrian, and very, very dull.What was he thinking when he made this? The humor is like something out of a network sitcom and the script is dated and totally predictable. It clearly had a huge budget, and there are cameos from a lot of pop stars, and every single one of them is wasted. I think I laughed only one time in the film, and it was during a satire of TMZ.Don't waste your time or your money on this. Twenty minutes into the film I realized it wasn't going to go anywhere and I found myself getting more and more impatient for it to be over. I finally gave up and walked out after an hour, which is something I rarely ever do.",1,42,126,17 June 2016
50_50," Great performances, pretty poor script
","As a cancer survivor who who went through chemo and radiation for lung malignancy four years ago, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. In addition, I think Joseph Gordon Leavitt is an awesome actor. There are some great performances in this film, as well as one or two very realistic scenes (the isolation/alienation, the very real moment where he loses it in the car and finally proclaims he's 'tired of of it all'), but that's about all I could identify with. Chemo is an incredibly powerful (and, as Melissa Ethridge puts it 'barbaric') drug. The longer you're on it, the more cells it continues to destroy, and it basically slowly kills you. I saw the character sick after his first infusion, and then doing quite well throughout the rest of his illness. The opposite is true; you get worse, not more functional, and weaker. Your sex drive plummets, despite the character's desire to find women to hook up with (although I admit, when he finally did, things didn't exactly succeed), as well as your appetite, your sense of taste and smell. None of that was portrayed. Lastly, the tumor that he had on his spine did not shrink from the chemo and continued to metastasize, which is a concerning response; despite his surgery being semi-successful at the end, there was no mention of the high possibility that because of its size it had a high chance of continuing to spread. The film gave the viewer the impression that because they were able to remove it, he was 'cured,' which was definitely not necessarily the case. The other glaring inaccuracy in the film is a typical Hollywood one: the therapist begins a romantic relationship with his/her client. This is considered completely unethical and would result in the therapist losing her license as a result; so if this was based on a 'true story,' it's definitely been embellished for the screen. Seth Rogen and Anjelica Huston were, as always, terrific. But I'd really like to see a Hollywood film made that portrays cancer as it really is. This is definitely not it.",5,8,18,24 November 2011
