Your Name.," There are massive plot holes in this one.
","At first I was enjoying watching this animation, it really appeals to your eye but not your brain. There are some ridiculous mistakes. How doesn't boy know the name of the place even though he can exactly draw the village? or how don't they know the time difference even though they use their phones quite a lot. Please not try to defend them like 'They were dreaming'. After realizing they are switching their bodies, they kinda gain their consciousness and they are even trying to not harm each other's lives and spending several days in each other's bodies. You must be dumb to not know the name of place you had been living for several days in someone's body or not realizing you shifted 3 years back and forth.",6,0,0,10 February 2020
A Quiet Place," You are not gonna like this movie if you have at least double digit IQ.
","This movie is full of inconsistencies. You can't even focus on the movie itself while considering all this stupidity level. Why do they stay in a wooden house that constantly creaks? Why are they staying in a house covered by corn fields that limit the field of view? Why does the couple have a baby in such a world? The only reason the producer put the baby in this movie is the thought of something has potential to make a noise any moment, but he has never even considered if this was irrational or not. Why does the creature turns to the fireworks sound that produce relatively less noise instead of attacking the screaming woman just next to it? Does the producer even know what relativity is? Why does the man sacrifice himself instead of throwing an object in order to make noise. Isn't it the easiest way to mislead such a creature so sensitive to sound? They didn't even use it once in the movie. Please don't make movies if you are shallow enough to realize that much inconsistency.",3,1,3,8 February 2020
