The King's Speech," The King's Speech
","Unexpectedly good, photography, editing, soundtrack, performance almost flawless. Every shot can become a beautiful work when it is fixed; soundtrack is also played in a circle from a long time ago; and delicate, elegant, solemn and atmospheric performances are also easy for viewers to forget the existence of time, and the film will end quietly and immerse people in it.",9,0,0,28 April 2020
Gravity," Gravity
","Completely overwhelmed by the technical level; photography, sound scissors and mixing are impeccable. Lovecraft said: the oldest and strongest human emotion is fear, and the oldest and strongest fear is the fear of the unknown. The dark void of the universe is the source of fear. It is because of this fear that I am unprepared to be hit by the traditional theme of Hollywood in the second half. Karon used simple stories to lure out the most primitive human emotions",8,0,0,21 April 2020
The Danish Girl," The Danish Girl
","At first, I kept thinking, is this situation like Einar a dual personality or a transgender? Later, he felt that it was not important to attach any label. He just spent his life to live another life he wanted. He was not a patient. Such people are still marginalized 90 years later, but fortunately at least medical technology can reduce the tragedy. The stars are great, but the story can be dug deeper",7,0,1,19 April 2020

Suicide Squad," A good screenwriter is very important
","Is it really that ugly? The answer is No. Surprise and beauty coexist in the first part (because I have Ike barinholtz Finally, I introduced the team members. But it's a pity that the movie was discouraged at the most critical time, which led to the incoherence and confusion in the end. I have to say that the team's Cass are the most capable / competent group in all kinds of change series, so I expect them to be better and better writers in the future.",6,0,1,18 April 2020
Life of Pi," Works of Ang Lee, one of my favorite Chinese directors
","People always have to believe something. As mentioned in the film, this story makes you believe in God. The whole film is like a fable, telling a legend with this goal. As in the book, the front part is a little dull. Through this period, when the adventure begins, a thrilling fantasy adventure begins. Blue sea, green island, white boat, yellow tiger, the vision of the movie is very gorgeous. Although I have read novels, I will still be moved.",10,0,0,22 April 2020
The Hurt Locker," The Hurt Locker
","The film made my tears burst out, yes, you are right, it is the man bomb that exploded. Then there is the light of fire all over the sky. People's restlessness and crying really present a hell on earth. In hell, everyone is facing their own bad results. Some people are just suffering, but those who are fed up with the pain will reflect.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
Marriage Story," Marriage Story
","Near the end of the film, Nicole, who has a new love, hears that Charlie is about to move to Los Angeles to settle down. When she sees each other, she feels speechless. Then she chokes a little. This scene should be the most delicate and powerful scene in the whole film. It tells two painful things respectively: when a person has stopped expecting all the time, what she pursues has been achieved unexpectedly, and when a person finally learns to sacrifice himself for her, the person he wants to sacrifice for has gone. The movie gradually reveals the spiritual world of both parties in the conversation over and over again. How much concession the woman has in the marriage is how vicious it is in the divorce, and how selfish the man is in the marriage is how overwhelmed he is in the divorce. By the end, no matter which side of the audience is more inclined to divorce, they will not feel that the other side is making trouble or even empathizing with the other side.",8,0,1,14 April 2020
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Vicky Cristina Barcelona
","Woody seems to like thinking about women. Three women, Vicky is black, introverted and realistic; Christina is white, straightforward and free; Malena is red, talented and hot. Vicky is a cube, occasionally rolling and finally landing firmly; Christina is a sphere, occasionally landing but not staying; Malena is a dancing flame. If I say that all three of them are you, please don't be surprised. In fact, women are very complicated animals. Old Woody just peeled her off.",7,0,0,1 May 2020
Green Book," It's worth an Oscar
","The color matching version of 'untouchable', a road trip across the United States, but also a human journey across race and color, identity and class. All the subordinates were respectful to Tang. Only Tony treated him as an ordinary person, gave him fried chicken and told him the real idea. It's true not to discriminate against him by not treating him as black. On the other hand, Tang was discriminated and insulted by other people. He always held his breath. The audience who listened to him could eat in the restaurant, but not as a performer. It was Tony who taught him to fight back, to speak for himself and to defend his rights and dignity. It's ironic to be treated unfairly in the so-called 'high-end and noble' places, but to be respected and supported in the 'low-end and humble' black bars. Genius is not enough. Only courage can change people's hearts. Since he doesn't think about your feelings, why do you take care of his emotions? Bear to push forward for a while and step back to make progress. Violence won't win you anything, but cowardice is always a loser. Only by confronting the malice of life can we defeat it",10,0,0,16 April 2020
Happy Feet," so lovely
","Because of my natural love for animals, I have great expectations for this animated film with animals as its leading role. I feel very happy after watching it. I don't want to say anything about its theme, I just want to express the lingering feeling after watching it. When watching this film, I was thinking, Whether people ignore the world of animals or even plants outside of human beings. They have their own lives and values. They are fighting against the cold, they are fighting against the natural enemies, they are fighting against hunger... But they are happy because they are living in their own world. But when we see mumble being locked up in a place similar to an aquarium, when it runs into walls, It's sad to hear that humans are arguing that they are just animals in Antarctica. When one day we become penguins and shout to aliens in our Penguin language, what kind of mood will we have? In short, I like this cartoon very much. Penguins are also cute... It's worth watching",8,0,0,3 May 2020
