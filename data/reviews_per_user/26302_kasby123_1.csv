The Finest Hours," What a great movie - did not expect that
","You know what... some people will never give a movie with some cheesy romance a 10, but today I do, as the romance just helped support the main story, a true story been told to us in a remarkable way. I normally don't enjoy movies set in the olden days like the 50's etc, but this movie must have caught me on a good day. The lead acting was so good it really made me feel like these people were from another time, definitely not a time I know of personally.I even think the special effects were spot on. I mean, chaos is chaos, so people who want to see amazing special effects, but want the realism of a storm, are just been ridiculous. Some times in this movie you actual don't know what's going on, only making you feel the fear and frustration experienced by the crew you are watching. So that's it, my first ever review on IMDb. I have not enjoyed a movie this much since I watched Pearl Harbour... good old Disney fun with the family - the kids can join by the way - they totally enjoyed it too.",10,1,8,6 February 2016
