The Blair Witch Project," Oh, my gosh, this movie was horrible!
","I cannot express how disappointed I was in this movie!  I had such high expectations, it was sooooo hyped up, and it totally bombed.  There were like 2 scared people in the entire theater, even my MOM thought it was bad! A very good idea totally blown.  Man o man, this movie so almost put me to sleep, I mean, it did get somewhat chilling, but then literally 2, yes guys, 2 whole seconds later, it ended.  And that's all I have to say about that.
