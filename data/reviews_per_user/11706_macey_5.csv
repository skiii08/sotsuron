Ali," You may have missed the point.
","* Possible Spoilers if you don't know the history of Ali *Yes it's a little long in places but it's really a great film if you think about it from the perspective of a young black american who remembers sitting in the back of the bus and seeing newspaper articles on racial hangings, to a man who was inspired by the inspiration he gave to the African people of Zaire. As confusing as that last sentence may sound I think some people missed the point on this film. They seem to have expected to see Ali's entire history, or Ali's greatest fights, or their personal memories of Ali but what they got instead was what drove the man through the years that defined him. What made him the fighter who wouldn't let Geogre Foremen, or the American Government, beat him. Very interesting if not essential.(and for the record I thought 'When they were Kings' was a little too long as well)",6,0,0,29 December 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Because Geogre Lucas said so...
","It seems most people who liked this film already knew a lot of the back story and could fill the plot holes with their own interpretations, while making excuses for the horrible dialogue - 'But Anakin's supposed to be awkward etc, etc'. Never forget that, as you so proudly say, George Lucas created Star Wars.It's his universe, it's ridiculous for anybody to defend this movie by quoting from its own twisted logic. Why aren't Jedi's allowed to fall in love? It's no law, it's because George Lucas said so, just as easy for him to change it. Why did Anakin come from a virgin birth? Because George Lucas said so. Why does this movie have so many plot holes? Because George Lucas said so. George is making the rules up as he goes along and it's making less sense with each episode. Everything in this film is because GEORGE LUCAS SAID SO, and it's just as easy for him NOT TO SAY SO. And thereby make it a better movie. He shouldn't need hardcore fans to defend his bad decisions and confusing plot points!Why wasn't all this made clear in the film? Why? Because it was rubbish. And don't say it will all be clear in Ep3, because by then I would have waited 6 years and paid over $26 to make sense of it all, and that ain't the magic of movies. 2-3 years! I could die before then! And DO NOT ever say 'It's Star Wars, not Shakespeare' - Read the 'Empire Strikes Back' script again. Not a wasted word, a classic piece of writing and unequalled in it's genre. NOT written by George Lucas. In fact, NOT directed by George Lucas.",3,0,0,14 June 2002
American Beauty," Look Closer
","I'm so glad I never commented on this straight after I saw it. Although I liked it, at first I thought it was trying too hard to please everyone and didn't quite concentrate on one story aspect enough. But now after seeing it for a second time I really appreciate what a brilliant piece of writing it is, brought to life by a talented crew. A truly great film beautifully shot and acted. The parents of the boy next door deserve special mention.",10,2,4,11 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," It's this years Godzilla
","Taking all the best bits of Saving Private Ryan, Titanic and Top Gun and creating none of its own. Even the awesome digital effects cannot save this film from a severe lack of story interest and character. The leads are generally unlikable unless your already fans of them with a clunky, overly patriotic script and intrusive swelling strings score. The Historical inaccuracies are to be expected (even as they fly West from Japan into China? - check the sun set). But there's nothing I hate more than a well made, high-production-value BAD MOVIE. And this it. It's this years - Godzilla. Affleck's lines like 'How do you like it with someone firing back at you?!' can only be laughed at considering Hiroshima and Nagasaki.",1,0,0,11 June 2001
Love Actually," If you liked it, don't read this.
","Well first I'll just write this to fill up my 10 lines.Although this is far more effort than I wanted to spend on commenting on this.Just one more line and I think I'm done.If you're reading the IMDb comments then you either want to find out that you're not alone in feeling warm and 'fuzzy' about this film or you're looking for negative comments to excise of some of the anger and hatred that built up watching this contrived transparent piece of S..TWell, if you did like this then I'm not surprised, you obviously like any old piece of s..t that's thrown at you with a happy ending.",Null,0,2,24 April 2004
