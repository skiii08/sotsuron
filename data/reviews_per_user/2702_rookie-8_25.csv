The Blair Witch Project," Stupid people don't like this movie
","This is not a popular thing to say, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I didn't like Titanic at all, but I am obviously in the minority in my feelings. If you don't like a film that is your perogative and it is what makes this country great. However, having read the reviews on this site I have come to the conclusion that most people who hated this movie really do sound stupid while trying to explain why the film is so bad.Firstly, if you didn't like this film and you want to put your comments down, please do not start your summary off with ' The only thing scary about Blair is the price of admission', or the even wittier ' Scary as hell!!!!!! That I paid 8 bucks to see it.' Almost everyone who did not like this movie started off with something of that nature, which was the first indication I had that people who hated this movie are, overall, stupid. If you do find it important to start off with comedy such as this, please also include you address and place of occupation so that I could find you and beat you. It is for your own good.
Secondly, if you have read anything about this film, ANYTHING AT ALL, you will know it is not a classic 'horror' film. There are no ghouls or goblins to jump out after you. Jason isn't going to get you out by the Lake house and Freddy isn't going to come for you in dreams. This is a story that is scary because it is REAL!!!!! You can't see what is in the woods, you can't see what is stalking the students because THEY can't see what is stalking them. So many negative reviews have involved comments like 'I kept waiting to see the witch' or 'how could it be scary when you never see anything.' One person even wrote, while commenting on how 'fake' she believed the story was, that 'it made no sense for them to be screaming all the time.' If I was caught in the woods, or in my backyard for that matter, with something coming after me, I would scream all the time to. Just another 'stupid' comment.But what makes it very apparent to me that those who hated this movie are just not that bright is the fact that everyone who has loved this movie and written about it has talked about imagination. This film is about putting yourself right into the action, right with the characters, at all times. The bickering, the yelling and the screaming, are all things that, in a situation of that nature would actually happen. The day scenes, save for a few discoveries, showed the other side of terror and that was the mental breakdown of all these characters. They gave up hope, they gave up any idea of living through what was happening to them, and that comes across on screen. For those of us who were able to put ourselves in the shoes of Heather, Josh and Mike, that part of the movie was just as frightening as anything else. The night scenes are scary because you cannot see what is out there. The sounds and voices are freaky and make anyone who has ever been in a house alone at night and heard the pipes grumble a bit squirm in their seat. I DIDN'T want to see what was out there because then that would defeat the purpose of the whole movie. It would defeat the purpose of letting the audiences imaginations (those of us who have them) run wild for an hour and a half only to show them the witch, or whatever it was that was stalking the students, right at the end. Its greatness was in allowing for everyone to come away from the movie with a different interpretation of what happened.Many will assume that this review, or comment more correctly, is the spawn of a stuck up elitest who takes pride in liking something that is not main stream. Nothing could be further from the truth, as most of the time I despise ARTS movies. I like big action, big explosions. Hell, one of my favorite nights during the week is when TNT does their 'Movies for Guys who Like movies' thing, but this movie to me is a no brainer. (or maybe a brainer, as it seems those who have them love the film) The Exorcist, Alien, The Shining, and many other great horror movies fit into the Blair category. They scare you more with what is not seen than what is seen. They build tension, never letting up until the end, so the audience goes away just as scared as they were sitting in their seats. Movies like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, the seemingly popular horror of today, put in their horror as almost an afterthought. There is no tension built, there is no breaking down of the characters, there is no squirming in seats, only gore and shock and jokes. That might be horror, but it is not GREAT horror, as Blair Witch is. 
Those of you with imagination, go and be scared, be very scared. Those of you who fall into the category of 'nothing happened in this movie, it sucked so bad', Freddy vs. Jason is in production and should be out next summer.",10,1,2,5 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Intense, Intense, Intense!!!!!
","This movie is unsettling. The night scenes should have been longer and the sound could have been better, but that sense of impending doom is something that has carried over with me even the day after viewing the movie. The realism of the camera and the realism of the actors, who draw you into the woods with them and leave on you the dread so prevalent throughout the film, turns your stomach at times. A girl who viewed the movie right before I did vomited and had to leave. In fact, many people left the theatre before the end of the movie, right around the time Heather turned the camera on herself. This movie builds tension like none other I have ever seen. The beginning is funny and light hearted as the film makers interview locals, then it begins to turn around as the three go deeper and deeper into the woods without a real clue as to where they are going, then it just because disconcerting as the three realize the danger of the night. Anyone who has ever camped out will realize that this movie is the realization of all the horrors that cross your mind while pitching your tent. Walking out, I felt uneasy and the many pictures that will no doubt be talked about for years to come were running through my mind. (especially the last scene, which will go down in horror history as one of the classic scenes of all time)The two friends I went to go see it with left the theatre feeling disappointed, as they felt it just wasn't scary enough. The next day, both called me saying they couldn't sleep the night before, and all of a sudden the movie that had left them disappointed became, for them as it was for me, the first reason in a very long time to leave a light on at night. Don't get too into the hype so as to not allow yourself to appreciate the movie, but also don't listen to the negative reviews. I have found that 90% of those who hated the movie complained of not seeing the 'monster', or that after viewing many a movie at film festivals (the red flag phrase for film students, or those who think they are film students) they weren't impressed at all. Those who like slasher movies will be bored and those who attend film school at NYU will be pissed they didn't think of it first.Those of us who still cringe when we see 'The Exorcist', can barely watch the screen in 'Alien', feel the chill on the back of our neck when the kid in 'The Shining' recites RedRum over and over again, will love this movie. It will leave certain images in your head, certain ones that you will want to forget, and will leave you in your car, or in your house, realizing the truly freightening nature of this film. It is, in one word, intense.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Needed the Lights on
","I grew up with scary movies. For some reason my parents, and my grandparents for that matter, thought it perfectly exceptable to show a young boy (I couldn't have been any older than 8 or 9 when I saw my first 'Friday the 13TH' film) countless horror flicks that they were so engrossed in. By the time I saw 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' nothing was really all that scary. Yet, I have always found that the movies which leave the most fear behind are the ones with the least amount of gore and, more often than not, the least amount 'startle' shots (Jason jumping out of the woods). The 'Exorcist' is one of my favorite movies of all time, along with 'Alien' and the 'Shining' because of the sense of doom that each evoked in me. They were all terror driven movies, where the tension built and built without  relief until the final, classic scenes. It wasn't about  scaring someone for a moment, making them jump in there seat, but about truning a persons stomach inside out for more than an hour. Those movies caused people to squirm in their seat, to let out a soulful groan when a classic 'horror movie mistake' was made, and to turn their face when the end was near because it was just to unsettling to see. That is why to me movies like the ones before mentioned, especially 'Exorcist', are not merely horror classics but simply movie classics.This film was billed as the 'best horror film since the Exorcist' and, as you might have guessed that line sparked my interest. After reading several very positive reviews billing 'The Blair Witch Project' as the scariest movie ever, and reading several posts from internet users concuring, my interest was further heightened. But then the phrases like 'overhyped' began to be shot around and word that many user comments on well known, and trusted movie sites were planted by the studio or friends of the actors began to be spread, making me doubt the effect of this movie. I usually end up hating overhyped movies (Godzilla being the king of this genre) and am not easily scared to begin with, thanks to my families deliquent childhood pratices (sorry mom:). When time came to finally see this movie I entered it with very mixed emotions, most leaning towards the negative side of the spectrum. I WAS WRONG!!!!!!!This movie is not only horrifying while watching it on the big screen, it is horrifying while driving home, walking to your home, looking out your window, or trying to go to sleep. It reaches you in so many different ways. I have read many people inferring to the 'unknown' being the most frieghtening aspect of this film, and while I agree it is most unsettling, it is only a part of what makes this film work. The realism of the camera, which is shaky but does not draw away from what you are seeing, and the realism of the actors, who should all be nominated for Oscars, draw you into the woods. The instinctual fear of being lost in a foreign place without hope of being rescued quickly, the fear of unknown sounds and unknown forces at work all around you, the unsettling sight of people slowely losing their minds and their hope for survival, the nerve racking sound of people screaming and crying in absolute terror, and the fear of the dark all make this the most unsettling movie I have ever seen.This is a squirm in your seat, look away from the screen, and tell me when it is over movie. The entire film held for me the intensity of the moment Tom Skerrits character went to go look for the alien in the vents, or when the little boy in 'The Shining' kept reciting RedRum over and over, or when Chrissy Watkins is attacked by Jaws in the very opening scene. Many people felt the same way, as most did not leave their seat for a few minutes after the film had completed, and some clapped while others just let out a sigh of relief. My two friends, two of the more skeptical friends I have who are not easily impressed, had good reviews after the movie was over, but changed them to great reviews the day after as neither one could get to sleep that night. I myself, mister Jason is funny and Freddy is a comedian, had to sleep with a light on and closed blinds and found myself very happy to have my girlfriend sleeping over the next night for not the normal reasons:) Don't miss this movie. Don't wait for it to come on video. Don't wait for the spoilers to come out. Go see it now and get scared. I rate it a 9 1/2 out of 10, only because I thought the night scenes could have been longer.",10,1,3,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't know what people expected
","I thought I had exasperated all I had to say about this movie, but having seen it again, and being that I plan on seeing it at least one more time, I feel as if there is more to say. Basically, my problem with the criticism this movie has taken is, WHAT DID PEOPLE EXPECT????? It seems as if the Star Wars of old have gone from action, adventure movies that left you feeling good when you left the theatre to a modern times Hamlet trilogy. Shallow characters, thin plot line, too much childish humor are the main flaws pointed out by the detractors of this movie. The reality of it is, however, that ALL the Star Wars movies, maybe save Empire, had the exact same flaws. Was A New Hope that involved in the characters? Was the dialogue Tarantino esque? Was the plot line complex, with millions of little nuances that only the most astute movie goer would pick up on? Or, was Star Wars the greatest good evil movie/s to ever come out? I think it is the later.Most of us fell in love with these movies when we were children, and though I can't imagine ever finding Chewy annoying, all of us who have waited for this movie have to take that into account when we villianise Jar Jar Binks. When I first saw the movie Jar Jar literally ruined the first half of the movie for me, but seeing it again I was able to tolerate him with much more ease. Though many of the scenes didn't need as much humor from Jar Jar as they ended up having, he is a character for the children to fall in love with, and they have. My little cousins, one 11 and the other 7, both went to see the movie last night and loved Jar Jar. They loved the exact things we, as avid fans, found annoying. There is a sense, I believe, by most of us who grew up owning all of the little action figures and watching the movies everyday after school, that these movie belong to us. That somehow Lucas owes us the best of the best, with absolutely no flaws. The fact is that this movie is truly for a new generation. It is for the kids who are the exact same age we were when we fell in love with this movie. While I was leaving the movie theatre on May 19th I heard many youngsters, some a little older than others, saying that they didn't know much about the old Star Wars but that they had loved this movie sooo much that they were going to go and rent the other three movies. That is what this movie is about.For all of you who hated this movie, or came away from it feeling let down, I advise you to see it again, or maybe even two more times. Go and just have fun. Don't think about how much more 'developed' Qui-Gon could have been or how Obi Wan and Darth Maul could have been given bigger roles. Don't go in expecting Jake Lloyd to give an Al Pacino performance or Natalie Portman to be Princess Leia. Go to just have fun. Go in with the child like attitude that you had when you first fell in love with these movies. Go in to be a kid again and I guarantee that you will not leave, this time, disappointed.",10,0,0,27 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," GREAT, GREAT, GREAT
","After having read several negative reviews on this movie, and being an avid Star Wars fan that has hyped this motion picture up in my head as much as it has been hyped in the media, I was ready for a let-down. The other three were so good, and made for such an enjoyable time at the theatre that I felt the only way it could go was down. Well, the movie didn't surpass any of the others, but it definitely didn't drop to the bottomless pit of all-hype-no-substance movies. First off, the acting in this movie is great, right up to par with the usual Jedi masters of old, even though one did wish for the intervention of a Han Solo type character half way through. Liam Neeson was a great, patient Jedi master who was complimented well by the outstanding Ewen McGregor, who was perfect as the stubborn, all talent and fury, Obi Wan Kenobi. Jake Lloyd, for all the criticisms, played the role he was cast in perfectly. It is hard for me to understand what the critics wanted out of this young man, he played the courageous young boy to perfection, and was able to subtly foreshadow what we all know he will become well. Darth Maul was chilling, and my only regret is that he couldn't have had more scenes in the movie, but the battle scenes involving him are absolutely magnificent. The effects, as was expected, are second to none, and even though the computer animation is obvious, it does not ruin any of the realism of the movie. The pod race, which is a mix between Ben Hur and the speed racer scenes in Redi, is wonderful, and really signifies when the movie takes off into the land of outstanding movies. The Queen is great, and even though she does not have the Lea attitude, she portrays the stoic Queen very well. The only real problem I have with this movie, and what will keep it from being one of my all time favorites, is unfortunately one character. Jar Jar Bing, I believe that is what he is called, is sooooooo annoying that I spent the first half of the movie wishing he was not in it. The kids will love his antics, but for comic relief he only goes to ruin what would otherwise be great scenes. Honestly, if you go to this movie, and after about a half an hour feel as if you are destined to hate the entire thing, ask yourself why and the answer will be Jar Jar Bing. I will see this movie again because I honestly spent the first half hour of it hating Bing and thinking I was going to hate the movie. If you feel the same way, take care, you will end up loving it by the end. If anyone associated with the movie reads this, KILL JAR JAR BING!!!!! Besides that, Titanic, enjoy the next month or so as the highest grossing movie ever, because Obi Wan, Anakin, and Darth Maul are coming to get you:) May the force be with you, because it was with this movie.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
The Ring," Very Scary, Worth Seeing, but too many questions unanswered
","This movie is scary, there is no denying that. Gore verbinski does a great job of giving the audience a little of everything you could want from a scary/horror movie; dark, dank settings, creepy kids, a gloomy storyline, plenty of 'jump' moments, and an overall plot that keeps you guessing. The characters do a good job not overacting, which is so often the norm in movies like this, and Naomi Watts is an absolute treat to watch on the screen not only because of her absolutely breathtaking beauty but also because of her obvious talent. There is no all looks and no talent, or as I like to call it Julia Roberts syndrom here. The girl can act. So if you are looking for a recommendation it is simple; GO AND SEE IT!!!!! It will creep you out, at least a little bit, and around Halloween time, as we all parade around to haunted house after haunted house, isn't that what it is all about?But for those of you who did see it, doesn't the movie lose a bit by leaving so many questions unanswered? When I say questions I mean questions about plot holes which, after a night of thinking on it, there seem to be a plethera of. SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!First, why does it seem that the video tape is, on one hand a documented recording of Samara's memory, and at other times it appears it is fortelling the future for the characters? At one point, upon leaving a building, Watt's character walks under a ladder and remembers the ladder from the video. Fortelling the future. But why does the video do nothing of the sort for the rest of movie? Wouldn't it have been better if it were simply a recorded memory?Second, why is the father still alive? He obviously knows of the tape, has even seen it, knows what it can do, knows what his daughter does through the tape, and we know that Samara hated her father. So why does he live until he takes his own life? Why not go after him? Why not kill him?Third, this is less of a plot hole then just an absolutely assinine thing, but why, when she goes up to the horse and it freaks out does she continue to stay near it/try and calm it down? Wouldn't you get the sense after, I don't know, the second full body convulsion the horse has that maybe you are not a horse person? Maybe you would walk away at that point but Watt's character keeps going as if some magic combination of 'Shhsh' and 'calm down boy' would put the horse into a deep sleep. Yes, we get it, the horses hated Samara because she hated them and killed them so they can sense her presence. We don't need a completely insane moment to prove it.Fourth, why wouldn't Watts have picked up on the fact that the doctor asks Samara on the tape if she still wants to hurt people? How could she just gloss over that? It was pretty clear, doctor on the other side of a glass sheet, first bad indicator right there, asking a very creepy looking girl whether she wanted to hurt her mother anymore and very creepy girl answering no but she can't help it. Boy, not something I would soon forget. You would think that would have been a clue that the girl was just a bit off and that maybe it wasn't just about a mean old man making her live in a barn all the time.Fifth, why does the father hit her? He doesn't try and kill her, she isn't taking evidence that could lead to some sort of harmful event for him, and she recovers pretty easily from it just to watch him kill himself. Why hit her? He was just pissed she used the VCR without asking? He decided it was either that or put off killing himself and heat up some coffee? Doesn't make much sense.Sixth, if the kid, who gets all huffy when he finds out his parents helped out the girl, knew that Samara was evil and should not be helped or aided in any way, why not tell his mom? Why does he just sit back, draw some horrible painting, the kid has no talent, and make it seem as if the girl is a nice little ghost who comes to visit him? Why not have the ' oh by the way, that girl that comes to me and shows me things, you know the girl who said she is gonna kill you, well she is pretty damn evil so be careful and for Goidsakes don't help her' conversation? That never crossed the kids mind?Seventh, what is the point of finding out, so late in the game, that the guy, the random VCR geek guy, is in fact the father of the kid? Why are we told this in the middle of the movie? Why is this information so shocking that it requires a sudden, poignant moment of it's own in the MIDDLE of the movie? Does anyone really believe that people would have left thinking 'Boy that was good, but I really wish they would have saved who the kids father was until right in the middle of the flick. That would have made it an Oscar contender.'Finally, what the hell good does it do the creepy evil girl to have been released from her well? Instead of killing people through the TV she now comes out of the TV and kills people. Wow, big freakin Wow. She still has to wait I guess, she still has to go through the tape, and she still, I assume, has to wait 7 days or she would have killed the guy that same day as when she was released. And in the end Watts and the kid beat the system by making copies and showing it to people. So thats all you have to do I guess, make a copy and sho it to someone else and your off. So why is thise so damn bad? Tell that person to make a copy, the next person the same, and on and on and on until poor little creepy evil girl can't kill anyone cause their all making copies. Of course she would have a huge comeback when VCR's are all replaced by DVDs and no one can make a copy anymore, but until then she is kinda up the creek. And this after doing so much to get herself freed from the well, she still has to live/kill by the same rules. Kinda kills the whole plot at the end, doesn't it.But funny thing is I still recommend this movie. Go see it and don't think till you get out of the theatre. Then you can rip it to shreads of the course of a few days.",Null,0,0,24 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," See it, See it now
","Let me start this off by saying that yes, I am a Star Wars geek. I loove the movies, love the characters, love the places and planets that occupy Lucas's mind and are then projected onto screen for the rest of us to enjoy. I own ALL of the other Star Wars movies, yes even Phantom, and have the dubious distinction of being one of only 4 people in the world who have not lambasted Phantom for 2 years now, and the only one without the last name of Lucas. Now, when I say geek I do not mean someone who comes to the movies dressed as Darth Maul or someone who refuses to see Lord of the Rings or Matrix becomes it disrupts the force. I am just a geek, not a loser. Getting that out of the way, onto the movie.****I don't know how to do this without spoilers so if you don't want to know ANYTHING, and I do advise that, then turn away now. I will try and keep them at a minimum but I am also not going to hold back.*****
THINGS NOT SO GREAT:The Love Story: It drags. Yes, it is important and yes all of us should have been, or should very well be ready for this story. It is important. I mean we need to see how a hotty like Amidala could ever hook up with Darth Vader, right? I mean was she the only female in the world who bought the 'I fell down and it just kinda went in there, and then I tried to get it out....'? No, I think not. So we need to see them talking about politics and family and love and dreams and blah, blah, blah. Yes, it is needed but it is tedious. For anyone who argues that the problem with this movie is character development is off his or her rocker. This movie develops, and then some.CGI: There is just too much of it. There just wasn't enough 'REAL' people to go around. I think that Lucas and his cohorts have become so adepth with the computers that they have forgotten that one of the beauties of the first trilogy was all the people running around in funny costumes. Maybe the next one will have a bit less of the computer and a bit more latex.
THINGS I LOVED:YODA: I am not even going to go there. Even if you think you want to know about Yoda in this flick you really don't. Just, WOW!!!!!!Obi-Wan: Its his movie. He gets less screen time overall then Anakin, but this is his movie. He is calm, cool, collected, kick ass, and funny all at the same time. Unlike Qui-Gon, who was good in the first, Obi-Wan has a humor, a temper, and some stubborness to him. He doesn't take certain things too serious, and other things he gets all riled up about. And his interaction with Anakin, very good, and much more interesting then his own interaction with Qui-Gon. Ewan Mcgregor is one of the best in any of the Star Wars films.Anakin: For some reason he is being slaughtered in the press, as is everything else about the movie, and it isn't fair. he is not the most likeable character in the world because he isn't suppose to be. I mean, remember, this dude eventually throws on a all Black suit, starts hoping around the galaxy killing Jedi, tries to turn his own son to the drak-side, cuts off his hand when he doesn't come around quick enough, and also sends his own daughter up for execution. No, not likeable at all. But Anakin is likeable enough in this movie to root for, he shows a wide range of emotions, makes you believe that he could kick some interstellar ass, and also has a very tender side. He does a very good job of being annoying yet innocent at the same time and it is easy for us to see his eventual path to the dark-side and who is going to take him there.Count Dooku: Yes, yes, yes. This guy is classy, he seems and acts like a Jedi, yet he has turned. He is powerful, he is bad ass, but never, ever losing his composure. He is a wonderful villian and even though he is introduced in the middle of the movie, kind of out of no where as a matter of fact, he is terrific.The Jedi: They are all there and you get to see them in action. Mace Windu and the others kicks some butt and the light sabers are swinging this way and that. For every Star Wars geek out there, you are going to love this.
IN THE END:This movie is not perfect, as no movie is perfect, and certainly as no Star Wars movie has been perfect. What every Star Wars fan should except is that these movies, in this trilogy, are vastly different then the other ones. This has politics and vast worlds, while the others are simply the fight to restore order, mostly taking place on desolate planets that offer nothing but despair. Though I would have preferred less CGI, the images are breath taking, unlike even the first one which saw only 3 planets. This movie is wonderful, where it ranks I do not know, but I do know I will be back to see it again, I will be back to cheer for the Jedi, and I will be back in two year when the next one comes out. Don't listen to the critics. Remember, many of them hated the first trilogy as well, how you like those? Go and have fun, root for Obi-Wan, Padme and the rest, and at the end take a deep breath. You will need it.PS. Jar Jar is non existent in this one.",10,1,2,16 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," That is how you make a movie
","There are certain moments in life that lets you know why it is you do certain things. The first time you meet and fall in love with a girl lets you know why you brave the bars or clubs every week, piling on rejection after rejection. The first time you get that big raise and huge promotion lets you know why you go to that run down, neon lighted hell called work everday, and the first time you hear a song like 'Stairway to Heaven' lets you know why you turn on your radio every morning, surfing through such ear bleeders as Britney Spears or N'Sync. Well, for me, watching Fellowship for the first AND second time has let me know why, after a year filled with monkeys and morons driving cars, I still go to the movies. Because something extraordinary can happen.Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings follows Frodo Baggins, and his other 8 counterparts, on a quest to destroy the one ring, a magical and evil ring, that could bring darkness to Middle Earth. Leading this quest, with his wit and wisdom, is Gandalf the Wizard, played by Ian McKellan, who leads this band of hobbits and elves and dwarves and men to the Mountain of Doom, to destroy the ring once and for all in the fires from whence it came. Of course the path to this mountain, and the evil which is bent on returning the ring to the Dark Lord who created it, make it a perilous trip in which death is a distinct possibility.If I were paid, as I am not yet, to share with you this movie and my opinion of it, then I would tell you how much I enjoyed all of the performances of the film. Elijah Wood is fantastic and, for anyone who loved the books, fits the picture of Frodo perfectly. Sir Ian is amazing in bringing all of the aspects of Gandalf, argueably the most famous character of the books, to life, and the rest do equally wonderful jobs. But the magic of this movie, in my mind, is in the effect it has had on myself and many who have seen it.It is a transportation, and escape of epic proportions. You believe from the moment the movie starts that you are indeed peering in on Middle Earth. That hobbits do in fact exist and are as cheerful and robust as the books say they are. You believe that evil can and does exist in pure form and that your heroes are being hunted by that evil. You believe everything you see and you lovce the fact that you are there. After 3 hours and 15 minutes you are ready for more, ready to watch your heroes finish their mission, ready to see good triumph over evil one more time, and you are ready to live in Middle Earth again, if only for another few hours.I have seen movies more then once at a theatre. I have loved movies, cried at movies, laughed at movies, and seen certain movies to the point of memorization that both astounds and annoys friends when watching the feature with me. I do not know where this movie rates on my all time list, since the experience of it is far too new, but I can say this. I have already seen this movie twice and I would venture a guess that 2 will not be the final answer to my viewing equation. I am in love with Middle Earth all over again, having been so from the moment I first put down The Hobbit, Tolkiens first novel of the like, to the time I began reading the trilogy. It brings many of us who loved the books back to that place that, before now, I was convinced only books could bring us to. It brings us to a place we do not want to leave, a place so different then the one we all woke up in today, but still so similar as to not be completely foreign to us. It is magical.I do not know if those of you who did not read the books will have as magical an experience watching this film but having been there with people who have not read the books I can say that enjoying it does not hinge on that fact. Some have made a point of being upset by the voting on this site but it is a simple reflection of the love most of us have for this story, for these characters, and for the world that Tolkien and now Peter Jackson have created. It is why we buy DVD's, it is why we still go to the movies, and it is why many who grow up watching films like this decide they, in fact, want to make them. It is why movies are made, and if it is not recognized by the Academy then, well, the Academy is lost for good.",10,0,0,10 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Amazing, Amazing, Amazing
","Amazing!!!!!!!!! That is my first reaction to this movie. My second, when I had time to think about it a little, take in everything I had seen, and really analyze the context of the movie was AMAZING!!!!!!! If you don't like the story, or never cared for the story and especially hated those obsessed morons who always talked about it, then this movie is not for you. It is a 3 hour movie and it is not a Hollywood type, in your face for 2 hours, half the world blows up experience. If that is what you are looking for, and I enjoy that as much as the next man, then you had better go somewhere else. This movie is remarkable, and if you love fantasy, far away places with strange and mystical creatures and amazing adventures, then this, in fact, is the movie for you to see.If you are scared off by the running time, let me just say that as with many great movies, Braveheart and the Godfather, the time flys by. If you are avid fan of the books, as I am, then you may be scared off by the fact that Tolkiens masterpieces can never truly come to life, except in the minds eye. Well, I agree, yet this movie fits and stays to the book as well as any movie ever has. The effects are amazing, the acting tremendous, the fight scenes astounding, just flat out great. Don't be scared off, go see this movie. I will be, again.",10,0,0,5 January 2002
Spider-Man," Terrific
","After last summer, in which more movies left you with an empty, almost annoyingly apathetic feeling when you left the theatre, it is wonderful to leave feeling good again. Feeling as if the now $9 it takes to get in and see one of these event movies is worth while. Spiderman works for me because of one simple fact, a fact I had had great reservations about before entering this film, and that fact was; Tobey McGuire.I have always been a fan of Tobeys work, I loved Wonder Boys, found some nice things to like in Cider House Rules, and have always found McGuire to be refreshingly real. He never tries to do too much, he just is in the moment and in a day where it seems everyone is just over acting every single scene they are in his minimal effort performances have always been good. But, this is suppose to be a kick ass, bust them up action movie where the real fun comes from watching this dorky kid becone a superhero with super-human powers. Could McGuire pull it off? The answer is............YES!!!!!!!Like Keanu Reeves did in the Matrix and Micheal Keaton did in Batman, McGuire is able to make you think that, yes, he can kick your butt all over Metropolis and still be back home in time for dinner. McGuire does a wonderful job of conveying both an innocent young man and a superhero who knows it is his duty to protect those less gifted then he. He makes you feel sorry for him, makes you laugh with and at him, and makes you believe in him in the scenes where he is saving the world, or New York at least. The star of the movie truly is just that and if you didn't know who Tobey McGuire was before this, you will after.The supporting cast can ver well be where the difference between a great movie and a so, so movie lie and in this case the supporting cast does a wonderful job. Defoe has gotten some criticism as the Green Goblin from press and some fan reactions alike, but at the end of the day Defoe carries the Goblin and perfroms brilliantly. He is mean, psychotic, but also funny and witty, bringing that great strength of all great superhero villians to life, and that is charm. He is funny while being evil and while we have no pretenses whom we want to see win the battle in the end, Defoe's Green Goblin is a witty villian who doesn't just bring death, but death with a punch line. Kirstin Dunst is wonderful at playing what she truly is, that radiant gilr next store, who looks like the type of girl every one of use would have fallen in love with in High School. She is strong when she needs to be and vulnerable enough for Spiderman to need to rescue her when she needs to be. And at the end of the day she is just flat out likeable. Maybe this won't win her an academy award, but you want her survive, you want her and Peter Parker to get together, you want her to get everything in her life worked out and succeed despite the odds. You like her and in this dayand age, when some actors play parts to the point where you wish for an atomic bomb to wipe everyone out at the end of the film, this oe presents us with characters we actually like.But for my money, the real gold star goes to Sam Raimi. I have always loved Evil Dead and Army of Darkness, so I am a bit biased, but he does an absolutely wonderful job of bringing a very difficult movie the the screen. Think about it, Spiderman doesn't fly, doesn't drive a car, but what he does do is swoop from building to building using his webs. That could present a serious problem for most, on how to create these movements without making everyone in the theatre sick, but Raimi seamlessly intertwines the speacial effects and the live action scenes.A wonderful movie, a wonderful job, and well worth the $9. Hopefully, as oppsed to last summer, this is a sign of things to come. Now all we have to hope for is a Star Destroyer falls on Jar Jar Binks and the world will be moving forward again.",Null,1,2,3 May 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Fun, Fun, Fun
","If you went into this flick believing it would be Oscar caliber writing, directing, acting, then maybe you should have waited a few more weeks to see something else. But, if you went into the theatre looking to watch cool Hollywood stars put on a cool movie where each and every one of them gets at least 1 or two memorable scenes/lines, then you exited the theatre with a big ol' smile on your face. Oceans 11 is fun, right from the very beginning when Danny Ocean is asked what he would do if he were released from prison right on through to the end. Clooney plays Danny Ocean as the straight up cool guy, the undisputed leader of the pack, who you yourself would follow into this caper just because the guy LOOKS like he knows what he is doing. Pitt is equally cool, suave, and kinda plays his character of Rusty as the old sage, even though he is obviously very young. You almost get the sense that while Clooney's character is the ring leader, the best thief/con-man, may in fact be Pitt and there is never, ever a moment where you feel like Pitt is in danger of losing anything.Matt Damon does a good job as the youthful thief new to the big score (see the seventh gunslinger in the Magnificent Seven for a reference) and is given some good moments, especially with Barnie Mac. Cheadle, I thought, did a wonderful job as the British born, cockny accented thief, but the strange accent and the strange words used made it hard most of the time to pick out exactly what he was saying. Affleck and Cann are VERY funny as feuding brothers and have some of the funniest moments in the movie and rival only Carl Reiner as a movie stealer. Reiner is GREAT as the old Saul and brings is wonderful to watch on the screen.Now, my only contention with this movie comes in the form of Julia Roberts. I understand she is in this movie because she is a huge star and she wants to come hang out with all these cool guys in Vegas. She seems like a very nice woman, even though she can come across as a little fake, but can anyone tell me they believe she really is a great actress? I mean, come on, she plays the SAME character, herself, in every movie, and in every movie it gets older and older. Now, I understand in this movie you are not looking for Lady McBeth, but can anyone really tell me she looks AMAZING? Lets face it, this role is designed for one thing, the glamourous, gorgeous woman who takes your breath away. Julia is a really cute soccer mom, not Grace Kelly re-born. The introductory scene of her coming down the steps? It looked like she was having a hard time walking in her shoes. All I could imagine was a Catherine Zeta-Jones or even a Michele Phiefer, graceful, glamourous woman who would take the audiences breath away walking down those stairs and, in the end, Julia just comes up FAR short. She doesn't ruin this movie by any means, but I guess I just have a hard time seeing the obsession with her.But that being said, this is a fun movie. It never seems to sit still for too long, it blends all of the stars together nicely so you don't have that somewhat nagging feeling like, oh I wish so and so would have had a scene together. To me, this will forever be a modern version os The Sting. Is it laugh out loud funny? At points yes, but not all the way through. Is it tense and suspenseful? Yes, at certain times, but not all the way through? Is it cool and fun and well shot, well directed, and well acted? Absolutely, throughout the whole thing. Leave your mind and your cynicism at the door and enjoy just simply being entertained for a few hours.",Null,0,0,8 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Not the subject matter for this type of movie
","Lets forget for a second, which is very easy to do in this movie, that the name of the film is Pearl Harbor. Let us forget for a moment that the horror of he attack scenes, something done very well, does not depict the reality of what happened. In other words, let us just look at this film for a moment as if it were a fantastical story created out of the minds of the people who worked on it. In that context this movie is not horrible.Saving Graces- What this movie truly has to draw on are a few things. First and foremost the special effects which are just dazzling. The team of Bay and Bruck did a wonderful job of creating reality on the screen and doing, if only for a moment, what every great WAR movie does and that is bring the action and the horror right to you. Secondly, the score and cinematography, which never gets a lot of attention since no one goes to the movies for that, is magnificant. It looks like old America, smells like old America, and at least sounds like an epic even if it doesn't exactly live up to that. Thirdly, Ben Affleck leads the list of a few wonderful acting jobs done on this film. Affleck, for the first time, looks like the leading man he is so often proclaimed as. At no time during his on screen perfromance did I beginning looking for Matt Damon or Bruce Willis to come and save him from being the focal point of the scene. He was everything a leading man must be, sensitive enough to appeal to the women and 'kick-a%*' enough for the men. John Voight as a perfect FDR and Dan Akroyd as a fictional Japanese decoder are wonderful in the movie and everytime they go off screen you are hoping it won't be too long until they are back on.Not worth the money- Where this movie falls short, however, is in expressing a story, other than the invasion, that people actually care about. The love triangle is absurd and so uninvolving by the end no on cares who ends up with who. Kate Beckinsale, keep calling her Blanchett wich she most definetely not, plays the love torn nurse who, through a turn of events I will not reveal, falls in love with two childhood friends Rafe (Afflek) and Danny (Hartnett). Beckinsale is aweful and fails to show even the slightest bit of creative maturity when forced into scenes calling for her to be distraught. Hartnett, as opposed  to Affleck, is a bore everytime he is on the screen and plays his part with about as much emotion as Al Gore on Valium. Though neither actor are given the break of having good lines, I still cannot get over the fact that the same man who wrote Braveheart penned this nightmare of a script, still neither showed the ability to carry even the most rudimentary emotions over the screen. In the most dramatic parts of the movie both of these characters react as if their nephews roomates cousins grilriends dog died of old age at 22 years old. There is no emotion, and the worst is Beckinsale who many times is caught dried eyed as she convulses from uncontrollable anguish. Not only is the acting horrible, the love story absurd, but it becomes an even greater blow to the movie when you realize that 80%, and I do mean 80% or more of this 31/2 movie is devoted to that same love story. It is absolutely amazing that SOOO much time could be spent on this story and by the end the characters remained severely underdeveloped and the audience apathetic to their eventual outcome.The real shame of this movie, and I didn't even touch on the end part which is actually too badly done to even be funny, is the fact that this movie not only could have been but SHOULD have been so much better. This wasn't named 'Hawaiian Love' but it was named Pearl Harbor. Real men, real heroes, real people lived and died on that faithful day and because of that this movie is an insult. My grandfather was stationed in Pearl Harbor in 1941 and was lucky enough, three days before the attack, to put to sea. He returned two days after the attack, helped rebuild a fleet and bury men, and sometimes, on nights when maybe he had had a few to many beers, spoke of the tapping he had heard from the men trapped within the Arizona. This was not a movie that should or could have afforded misrepresentations of the truth, silly 'two pilots vs. twenty, no problem' battle scenes, and most importantly, the idea that the amazing events of not only that day but the months that preceded it were not enough of a story to draw on. Having heard the tension and sorrow in my grandfathers voice as he told the stories of the friends he lost that day it is hard for me to care whether or not 12-14 year old girls need to see Josh Harnett without a shirt on to max out the dollars. This was a movie that SHOULD have focused on Pearl Harbor instead of treating it as an afterthought. Could you have included everyday reality of the people who lived the Pear Harbor experience, maybe even a less contrived love story? Most certainly, but only as a sattelite to the main story. In the end what this did was bring to the cinemas a $150 million extravaganza, with wonderful effects and huge explosions, that does not even attempt to honor the men who died there. How embarrassing.",2,0,0,28 May 2001
Pearl Harbor," Ending, subject make this movie awful....
","I must admit that upon leaving the theatre I had what you might call an ok feeling about this movie. Like so many people I ran the gammot of emotions with this movie; very excited about its release and then very skeptical after the awful reviews it received even before opening night. Going on Saturday my expectations were low and by that time I do not think it was going to take much for those expectations to be if not passed then at least met. Upon further reflection, however, I realized how good this movie could have been and how much of a disgrace it ended up being. The only reason to see this movie on the big screen is the 40 minute battle scene that actually depicts the attack on Pearl Harbor(remember the movie is over 3 hrs long) The effects are breathtaking and the depiction of this horror is actually very well done. Unfortunately that is about all that is done well. Now, leaving the film what disturbed me the most was the end. I will not give anything away but EVERYTHING after the attack on Pearl Harbor is tedious, predictable, and sometimes down right laughable. Alec Baldwin, who supposedly steals the movie according to some critcs, is amazingly bad for such a small role. His lines are all cliched to the max and his mannerism's'are prototypical old-school army man. Affleck is ok and gets the most out of a bad script, delivering some not so funny lines in a funny way and not so poignant lines with surprising feeling. Voight as FDR is great and Akroyd, though not in it much, is a pleasure to watch. Besides that the rest of the acting is extremely poor. Hartnett gives an amazingly un-emotional performance and even though the script gave few chances for any character development Hartnett, for a supposedly budding star and heart-throb, is overshadowed by anyone on screen with him. Blanchet, as the love torn nurse, is only watchable during the battle scene when she does a good job of mixing the horror of the moment with the need to stay calm to help injured service men. Though gorgeous onscreen, and she has the look of an old style movie star in this film, Blanchet does not convince the audience of any true emotion during the film. FYI Michael Bay, if you have casted an actress who cannot cry when asked to, use age old methods to draw out the tears. Too many times, in moments when Blanchets character should be distraught, she remains dry eyed, while pretending to sob.As I said, at first the major problem I had with this flick was the ending, which is about as bad an endig as you can get, and I do mean the entire hour of film after the attack. After having a day to think about it however, I realized what a disgrace this movie was and how Bay and Bruck used a horrible moment in American history to make an overly-hyped, big booming action flick that will make money. Granted nothing may ever reach the accuracy of Saving Private Ryan or even Platoon, yet this movie really makes no attempt to relate the seriousness of the moment. This was Armageddon and The Rock, with the same effects, the same 'one or two men can take on an army' concept, and an emphasis on horribly cliched moments and phrases. This movie could have been a wondeful depiction of that terrible day in 1941, could have brought the horrors of war, and espacially naval and air combat, home, and could have still done most of this while including a less time consuming, non-sensical love triangle. You may say, 'why do we need the horrors of war brought home once again, whats the matter with a more light-hearted movie.' You may have a point, but when dealing with REAL events it seems to me that the people who died must be honored, and honoring them means getting what ACTUALLY happened right. The fact that Bay and Bruck made little attempt to get all the details right is horrible. At least Titanic, another movie I am not in love with, made a good attempt to get history right and in the end focused the movie away from the Leo, Kate love fest and on he carnage that ensued. This movie fails not only as a product, that is a run of the mill movie, but also fails horribly as a cinematic repesentation of history. Veterans, who were honored, and righfully so, by the power of Ryan should be insulted by the almost insignificant role there horrible day plays in this film. Only 40 minutes devoted to Pearl Harbor in a movie named Pearl Harbor(that runs 3 hours)? An almost anxious jump away from the action back to the love-story? This not only fails as a movie, at least a $150 million movie, but also insults what many of our grandfathers and even grandmothers went through. For that, and that alone, stay away from this movie.",2,0,0,27 May 2001
Gone with the Wind," Just an astounding masterpiece that should be cherished by all generations
","I am 24 years of age and I can say that, for the first time in my life, last night, I saw GWTW. Thats right, I had never, ever seen the movie before, not even bits and pieces of it. Oh sure I saw Rhet sweep Scarlett off her feet and up the stairs, but that was about it. I had never seen one of the greatest American classics ever produced, not even a part of it.And would you believe I saw it alone? I have been asked by noit so few a girfriend to watch this movie, romantic and sweepingly epic as it is, but have always declined. Why? Well because I find, in my own point of view, that older romantic movies, just as older horror movies, are just not as effective on me today as they most undoubtedly were on people of that era. So I stayed away from this movie, believing that the hype and over-zelous love for this film would find me far too expectant of it and, thus, far more dissappointed then I should be. I was, however, very much wrong.I don't believe I will give, in any way, a general review of this film. Anyone reading this now knows of the story or has worshipped at its cinematic feet for years. Besides, a text book review, a dateline chronicle of this splendid film would not do it justice. As with great pieces of literature, the beauty lies not in the details but in the emotions garnered from the experience, and GWTW evokes such earth shattering emotions.You may scoff at my assertion that a movie could render upon me such strong emotions, but I feel that anytime an event takes place which alters the types of things that please you, that motivate you, that entertain or touch you in some way, well to me that is and shall always be earth shattering. I remember watching, as a child, JAWS and realizing that I could watch this story for years and years without ever tiring of it. It started a life long fascination with the sea and sharks which has never subsided. I remember being in 7th grade and reading for the first time a book that was a joy to read, a book that was an event at night rather then a burden. After reading, for my class, Lord of the Flies, I continued on, reading Lord of the Rings, and on and on and on after that to the point I find myself now where no night of mine is truly complete until I read a bit. I remember all of these things, and many more that have meant so much to me, and I can easily say that GWTW was one of those watershed moments for me.I want to visit Tara, I want become kismit friends with Rhet Butler, I want to find people in this world who loath Ashley as much as I do, who love and respect Melanie as much as I do, and who lust after, for some reason and not just physically, Scarlett as I find myself doing now. I want to see the old South as it was, with all of its splendor and horror, in slavery, put out upon the curb everyday for all to see. I want to see what the Civil War really looked like and I want to stand, jaw dropped and with a sense of dread, as men from both sides talk of short wars and little bloodshed.Mostly however I want to live the life that Gone with the Wind lays out. I want that life to be my life, if only for a moment, if only as a whisper in the ear of time. This movie made me believe in love, in that unquenchable love that passes all understanding, and made me afraid of it's trappings. I feel, even now, for Rhet Butler, so many years of wasting his love on someone incapable of returning it. I pity now Scarlett, left sobbing on the bottom steps of her gigantic home, loving the man she had just driven away with every pore of her being. I feel for them all as if I had known them myself, greavied with them in moments of lose, and celebrated in moments of triumph.This movie made me feel good, fullfilled, and satisfied completely at the end, so much so that I went to bed as writer, director, and actor, finishing a story I had just watch unfold. Sending Scarlett off to fight for Rhet, leaving Ashely behind to wallow in his own well deserved misery. I watched in my mind as Mammie grew older and more gentle as the years went on and Tara became smaller, yet more open and loving in its old age.I saw all this in my miond only because, as a great novel does, a great poem does, a great prose does, this movie left us all wanting more. Wanting it so much that we would stay awake at night, creating a larger, even grander world then the one we had been allowed to peer into. We needed to create more because 4 hours and 20 some odd years was not enough for us. It was but a taste, one so good we needed to raid the rest.And so will it go. New movies will evoke new emotions and new characters will make me laugh and cry and groan from disapproval, but GWTW will live on in my memory. With other films, they will pass in the halls of my thoughts only when I see them on TV or hear of them from friends, but GWTW will visit those halls from time to time without any pre-announced engagement. It will come in to brighten my day, to promise of something better, and to focus me on the beauties of life and all it has to offer. It is why we stare at the Mona Lisa, listen to Beethoven and Mozart, read Dickens and Shakespeare, and in the end, why we watch GWTW. For it gives us a sense of relief or purpose the likes of whcih nothing else does. For that, for last night, I am grateful for that story.",Null,6,9,25 October 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Robbed By William
","Watching the Oscars, it honestly never occurred to me that SPR would not win best picture. I had seen all of the other movies, including Shakespeare In Love and Life is Beautiful, and while both were good movies, Shakespeare in Love being, in my opinion, the weakest of the big three, I could not comprehend how either one could honestly compete with SPR. Ryan was not a movie as much as it was an experience. The first scene, the landing on Omaha beach, evoked an emotional response I have never felt during a movie before. I felt as if I were there, as if bullets were wizzing past my head and bombs were ripping my closest friends to pieces around me. When the opening scene was over I almost felt as if I were going to throw up, and I was happy the experience was over. Saving Private Ryan was, by far the best movie of 1998 and the Academy showed, once again, that the quality of the movie counts much less than the ad campaign one puts on to win the big trophy. Not only did the Academy rob Spielberg and all who were involved in the making of the production, it robbed the veterans of the war. By giving the Oscar to a cute little film that, quite honestly, would have made good ol' William gag, the Academy turned their back on the veterans as a whole. Now, did anyone who suffered through the horrors of that war lose sleep because of the award ceremony; not likely. But the Academy ruined their chance to honor those who died giving us all the right to live free as we choose. It passed up its chace to say thank you to all that served by honoring the best movie ever made about the terrors our men endured over there. So, the only thing left to say is, shame on you Academy for rewarding a vigilant ad campaign as opposed to a master piece of modern times.

Seabiscuit," Wonderful
","Some of the criticism I have heard directed at this movie centers around a couple of issues; not as good as the movie, too long, should have been better, mixing of documentary style with film does not work. Well, for me that is what made this movie as close to perfect as I have seen in a long time. Now granted, surrounded by the bloated, stinking, yellow teeth competition this summer has had to offer, Seabuiscuit may seem better then it is just because it tries to entertain. The rest of the movies out there this year seem to be almost laughing at you for 2 hours for spending your money. But I contend that even in a year where film after film raised the level cinema as we know it, this movie would be right up there with them. First, the length. By my last check, which was last night, I spend now almost $10 to see a movie and subsequently pay Julia Roberts $20 million per film to play the same, flighty, annoyingly stupid person she appears to be in real life. Money well spent. So if I am going to spend that kind of money, I want it to be worth it. Seabuscuit is worth it. The first 45 minutes is horse free, which seems strange considering the movie is based on the animal. However, without that setup the movie would never work. You have to care about these characters, hope that they win, hope that they make it out of the hell they are currently under, and root for them the entire time you are staring at the screen. You have to see them go through the hard times so that when the good times come, you are happy for them. The greatest failure a movie can make is to create characters no one cares about, or cast Kevin Costner. Either one is death. Its not as good as the book. Well, I have not read the book, but I am sure this is true. Books are ALWAYS better because a writer has an almost infinite amount of space to work with. As far as Laura Hillenbrand, author of Seabiscuit, she had 448 pages to work with to tell the WHOLE story. A movie cannot do that. They have to stay true to the tone or message of the book rather then to every detail of it. In this case, the message stays true to heart. Three men, beaten, battered, almost destroyed, find a horse with similar life qualities and together they come alive again. They become a part of society again, and as they become uplifted by this beaten animal, so too does the rest of a tired country, if only for a moment. The message is not lost. The intermingling of documentary style film with the cinematic movie. I personally loved this. I thought it was somewhat unneccessary during the War Admiral, Seabiscuit match race but even there it was done nicely and still recovered quick enough to account for one of the truly touching moments of the film. Besides that, I LOVE David McCollough, who narrates this film. He is not only one of my favorite historians, he is also one of my favorite narrators. His voice just makes you take things seriously. And being a history geek, the ken Burns like interludes are wonderful for adding to the atmosphere of the picture. I loved it.So, for me, this film worked on every level. The acting is incredible all the way around, and Oscars should be handed out to either MGuire or Bridges who are incredible. Cooper is great as well, playing a horse lover who has a knack for helping the less then perfect animals. To me, this is everything movies should be. Beautiful to look at, beautiful to listen to, and just a pleasure to watch. I hope Hollywood takes a cue from this movie and makes more like them. Movies that uplift, that inject a sense of pleasure in ones heart and make you feel like you $10 were well spent. Few films over the last several years have evoked that type of emotion.",10,0,0,28 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," LOTR Geeks (like myself), just enjoy and put the books down for a while
","This movie, like all others based upon epic books, will always leave some confused, frustrated, dissappointed, and down right pissed off. No movie can ever bring a book to life no matter how true they stay to the original novel. So Jackson, in his attempt to not only bring the books to life but to also make a movie, has tinkered with the story. He has cut here, expanded there, and just used his own imagination to develop parts in the movie Tolkien never imagined in the book. When all is said and done a person who loved the books does a great disservice to him/herself if they don't just watch instead of study. The beauty of Tolkiens story was that it entertained us. It brought us into a world called Middle-Earth and it never let us go, even when the final chapter of the book had been read. Jackson is doing the same thing, only in a different way. **********SPOILERS********************* Lets get to the changes. First, and possibly most serious, is the fact that Faramir is far different in the movie then the book. His basic character is changed. I for one was never a fan of Faramir or Boromir, never really cared for either, but Jackson takes far too many liberties with him then need be. Instead of passing the test of the ring in the lands outside of Mordor and sending Frodo on his way with Sam and Gollum, Faramir drags the threesome to Gondor, where he is ready, able and willing ti hand the little hobbitt with the little ring over to his father and thus destroy all hope that remains. I think Jackson did it to lengthen the journey through/to Morod part of the movie but it was not needed. Faramir also warned Frodo of Gollum and the path he proposed to take them on in the book, but not in the movie. Second, the whole romance between Arwen and Aragorn, and the displeasure Elrond exhibits towards it, is overplayed here. No one cares if Arwen leaves the shores of Middle Earth. She wasn;t a large character in the books and she is not that interesting in the movies. And Galadriel showing up out of no where, just to get some screen time, makes no sense either. Third, the elves never do show up at Helms Deep to help out the men of Rohan. This, in my opinion, is the worst decsion Jackson has made. To underscore the Rohirrim in favor of a brigade of Elves coming to help out in Helms Deep was a wrong decision in my opinion. I would have rather seen the fight of Helms Deep the book portrayed rather then the one Jackson dreamed up. But what did work? Gollum!!! I can't explain to you the startling reality of this character. I always found Gollum to be one of the most complex, interesting, disgusting yet pitiable characters anyone has ever created. This character is EVERYTHING he was in the books. He is perfect, as if Jackson simply opened his copy of LOTR and Gollum jumped out asking to see his precious. You fear him yet you pity him yet you like him yet you distrust him. He IS the character of Gollum. And the precision of the CGI on this character is amazing. He has feeling, emotions, and actions that are displayed through his eyes and his face. You don't think of him as a CGI character when you see him, you think of him as a pitiful creature, but one that is real. OUTSTANDING!!! The Ents!!!!! The book basically tells you, in much more eloquent terms then I use now, ' These guys are kinda crappy until they get p****d, then watch your a**.' And boy do they get going. The attack of Isengard by the Ents is incredible. It is brief but the power of the Ents, and the anger of Treebeard come to life in those moments. Helms Deep!!!!! Sure it is a little far fetched to have Gimli and Aragorn fighting 100 Orcs on a bridge all by themselves and not being touched, but who cares. They are heroes, right? They are the modern day Beowulfs, right? And didn't Tolkien write a story where a little hobbit killed a Nazgul? So that isn't a big deal. And the action, the action is incredible. The fight is overwhelming. The Orcs are never ending, the bravery is unquenchable, and intensity is palpable. One of the best battle scenes movies have produced. Finally, the characters!!! The love of Tolkiens stories, in my opinion, rest first on the amazing world the man created, then second on the amazing characters the man created to inhabit that world. In and out of the novels moved characters, some important to the story, such as Treebeard and Elrond, and others not so important but yet enchanting, such as Tom Bombadill. But the main characters are the ones most of us fell in love with. They were our eyes and ears. They carried our swords, killed the orcs we would have killed, and braved the hopelessness of the dark places the way we would have liked to. We loved them. And in this movie these characters come to life. Aragorn is strong and kingly, yet humble and unwilling to force his heritage on anyone. Gimli is strong, funny, awkward, and head strong, yet loveable. Legolas is exotic, fearless, and full of joy in times that seem to be devoid of such emotion. Frodo is weak, tired, stressed, fearful, yet loving even to the creature Gollum. Sam is simple yet strong and fearless and while Frodo is the bearer of the ring, for all intensive purposes Sam is the keeper of that ring and its mission. And Gollum is astounding. The characters are what drives this movie, our love, our hate, and our fear of all of them, but mostly by our deepest desire to see all of the main characters reach their goals. Go see this movie. Go see it tonight so that you can go see it tommorow. Go see it after Christmas and then read the books over again so you can be ready for the next one. But while you are watching the film, put the books down and enjoy the show. Enjoy middle earth.",10,0,0,19 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Where to start........How about AWESOME
","I love the books. Call me a geek, a loser, a freak, its been done before.(mostly by my mother) I love the world Tolkien created, that wonderous place called Middle Earth, and I love the characters that he sprung from its soil. I love everything about it. So when Jackson was making and then releasing FOTR I was excited, nervous, and a little apprehensive. How could anyone, even with Lucas graphics behind him every step of the way, how could anyone capture that magic the books cast upon most of us who read them? How could anyone do them justice? Well, Jackson did, and Two Towers comes close to eclipsing FOTR as a whole. First, it is darker, as the book is. There is more action, more fighting, more tense pressure put on by impending doom. Second, there is more comedy. These characters that seemed so distincted are now alive, real, human in this movie, where their love and their fears and their hates all come out in full view. Finally, there is Gollum. I have never seen such a character. You have to remind yourself that he is computer animated for one thing, but then the depth of the character, the depth of the emotions shown in its face, the eyes, the forhead, the body language, it is all just astounding. I could have watched Gollum all day and night. The charcater is so very interesting you do not mind being taken away from the action to seem him as he guides Frodo and Sam closer and closer to Mordor. Jackson does, as in the first one, take some liberties with the novels, not living up to every chapter in them, but the detail is so precise, the important moments so well done, the intensity raised to such a high level, that even the most ardent LOTR fans will not scowl at such changes.Go see this movie. Go see it once, twice, three times if necessary. It is great cinema, it is great escapism, but most of all it is a great story that finally comes to life. And now, we wait for the Return of the King. Is anyone else excited?",10,0,0,18 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," WOW!!!! People Got Paid for this?
","This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. No, granted, my favorite genre of film is not the abstract form of cinema this movie is created around. Yet, for the life of me I do not understand how ANYONE could like this movie. Exactly who is this movie geared towards? Children? Definetely not. I made the mistake, with this being a PG-13 movie, of bringing my 13 year old cousin to see this and it was, well, quite racy. While no one undressed there are several racy references, a scene where an orgasim is faked, an entire sequence, dance sequence that is, where 90% of the shots focus on the womens panties, and a whole lot of croch grabbing. Not something for the family.Is it for the older generation? Not likely. The opening sequence has Nirvana's 'Entertain Us' sung by the Moulin Rouge faithful and the entire film is filled with songs most peoples grandmothers and grandfathers would not know or would not like. Plus, some wonderful songs, like 'All You Need Is Love', an historic song by a historic group, was used as filler, and killed by two adequate singers who tried to sing the song in an old style musical format. HORRIBLE!!!!!!Is it for the younger generation? Well, from some of the posts I guess this is the group going. However, this younger generation may have a few who want to see a Pseudo-musical, since real musicals actually have original music, and some may want to seem artisticly adept by saying they like this film, but most young people, my generation that is,will more than likely stay away. The editing of this movie is horrible, the way it tries to combine the innocence of most of the older musicals with some modern sexuality gets to be confusing and disgusting, the editing is terrible as the style of the film changes drastically right in the middle, and the acting is horrible. Did anyone believe that Nicole Kidman would choose Ewan MGregor after the way he sniveled and whined throughout the film? It is preposterous and so badly done no wonder musicals are no longer made. DON'T ENCOURAGE THESE PEOPLE!!!!!! STAY HOME AND SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! The more money this movie makes the more movies like this will be made. Hollywood already makes 6 bad movies for every one good one. Lets try and make sure that the bad ones at least stay away from bad singing as well.",Null,2,4,14 June 2001
The Dark Knight," Just.............amazing
","This is cinema at its best. Just an astounding piece of work really, something that rivals the likes of Lord of the Rings that was able to combine wonderful action with an incredible plot. What this movie has, however, that perhaps no other 'serious' action movie has ever had is just top, top, top quality acting. I am not going to include any spoilers in this review because I honestly believe this is a movie that one must see to appreciate. Don't wait for someone to tell you all of the neat little tid bits, all the fascinating subplots. Go and watch it unfold on your own. What I will say is this, however. I believe that Christian Bale is one of the finest actors out there today, and the interesting layers he brought to Batman Begins last time was a joy to watch. He played the brooding Bruce Wayne and the 'cover' Bruce Wayne, billionaire playboy, with the same sense of passion. He moved in and out of each with perfect timing, and here he does the same thing. It never lets you forget who is behind the mask, and that a man, with real dreams and passions and problems, exists there, not some hocus pocus superhero that has no connection to reality. Bale makes it easy to believe that THIS Batman, HIS Batman could easily spring from the inner circle, the upper cust of the establishment if only the right set of circumstances were to come along. And then we have the Joker. Heath Ledger is brilliant in this, absolutely, positively brilliant. Going into this movie I thought that some of the talk about Ledger and a possible Oscar nomination could be attributed to his death and the natural reaction that comes from such tragedy. Ledger was a SUPERIOR actor, able to play a wide variety of roles, and an Oscar nomination for his last role would be fitting for someone that certainly would have stamped his name at the top of the nomination list many, many, many years. However, anyone who watches this performance and doesn't appreciate the stupendous job this young man did is just blinded by the notion that such lofty praise can only be afforded to a different sort of movie. Ledger fits it all into this role. He can be utterly amusing and funny, playing up his demented 'jokster' role to a tee. But Ledger and director Chris Roth never, ever let you forget what a vile, villainous human being he is. The Joker perpetrates some of the most reprehensible crimes imaginable, and his complete disregard for sense of morality or compassion is actually unnerving at times. Whereas Jack Nicholson made his Joker so funny and quirky, one couldn't help but enjoy and maybe even privately root for him to succeed, you can't help but despise this Joker, even if he makes you laugh a few times with his mannerism. Also, while Nichlson's Joker was always laughing and joking, constantly making light of dark situations, this Joker is simply deranged. He doesn't laugh uncontrollably. He takes great joy out of watching others suffer and, because he obviously doesn't care much for his own life, the closer he comes to death the more heinous he becomes. The action scenes are marvelous to watch and some of the chase scenes are actually intense. But this movie would be done a great disservice if it were ever simply referred to as a major summer 'action' movie or thriller. This is simply a high-intensity drama that should be nominated for Oscars beyond the one that Ledger should win for his portrayal. I will see this movie again as quickly as I possibly can.",10,2,5,19 July 2008
The Matrix Reloaded," Not Empire caliber sequel, but very good
","I think the hardest thing to do in the entertainment field is to make a good, fresh sequel off of a great, fresh original movie. The Matrix, while not being completely original as far as story, was fresh, exciting, and gave people sights and sounds that no one had ever seen before. To come back to that and recreate the magic is very hard.The Matrix Reloaded comes close to recapturing that magic. It is a visual feastival that leaves everyone breathless after several wonderful actions sequences. There are some things that don't work, some things that don't make a whole hell of a lot of sense, but overall a great sequel to a fantastic original.What didn't work? Well, lets run some things down.Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!First, the scene in Zion, which includes the most uncomfortable sex scene between Neo and Trinity ever. It seems to waver between wanting to be a soft core love scene and a artfully done romantic sequence. The Zion dance scene is strange and hard to watch. It basically is a rave with thousands of people dressed like Buddhist monks, a far cry from the leather clad heroes they are in the MatrixSecond, the whole scene with Merovingian, or really the whole story line with him and his program/lover. Just an unnecessary scene with a lot of philisophical talk of choice that seems to just drone on and on and on. And also, the fact that they made this character French, which has its own implications but is grating on the ears as one tries to understand the dialogue, is not needed. Just very strange dialogue, and a character that is not needed at all. After leaving the theatre I felt almost like I did after leaving Phantom Menace with Jar Jar in there. Why do that to a perfectly great movie?Third, the conversation with the Arcithect is just far too confusing. I do not mind high dialogue, or philisophical conversations, which is fine for this action movie with a mind, but with such a pivotal part of the movie, really the crux of what the rest of the series will be about, on the line the dialogue should be coherent. The audience should ne able to follow it completely and I don't think most of them could. Actually, it might be a wondeful ploy by the directors since I know I will be going back to see the movie to get my facts about that conversation straight and a lot of other people will as well. Its not the only reason to see it again but it sure is a close one.Fourth, the destruction of Zion at the end. Ok, Zion has been destroyed I guess. What happened? How many survived? Why isn't anyone else seemingly upset about this? I mean we have Link, whose girlfriend/wife is still in Zion when he left, and yet when hearing of the news there is no mention as to whether or not any of the crews loved ones survived. Needed a little more then that.What worked?The fight scenes. I know people became upset because the last movie left off where Neo seemingly no longer needed to get his Crouching Tiger on with every agent in the Matrix. Why fight someone when you can just jump into them and destroy them? But I rather like the action sequences and really, if he wasn't fighting them, what exactly would the action sequence be? Neo, jumping into agent after agent and just destroying them? Not fun. Plus, in the beginning,he goesd to punch an agent and is blocked, which prompts him to say ' Updates?' and continue on fighting. I just simply chose to let that line explain away the fact that kung fu fighting was still needed. The machines had adapted to his powers, some of them, and he could not simply destroy them the way he had before.The relationship between the characters. Neo and Morpheus seem to be in a very strange place. Morpheus is still the leader, but really it is what Neo says that goes. The oracle wants to talk to him and no one else, when there is a problem Neo takes control, ordering people where they need to be to survive. Yet Neo still bows to Morpheus and his wishes.The love between Neo and Trinity is a little too intense, seemingly rapped up in hot sex and fear of death. But it is well done and is vital to the ending where N eo chooses to save Trinity rather then Zion.The chase scene. What a ride. Best chase scene I have ever seen. Actually words cannot express how wonderful this scene is done. They have wonderful visual effects with wonderful fast actions moves. CGI and the live action is blended very well. It is worth the price of admission to see this scene.So there are some things that work, some that don't but overall it is a wild ride that needs to be seen. I will be going back to see it again, and from what I have heard people have actually enjoyed it more the second time around, with the expectations a little diminished. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it and 8.5.",8,0,0,19 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Fantastic
","I'm not going to bore you with what Star Wars has meant to me and all that bull*t. The fact is that the first two episodes in the prequels have been lack luster attempts, almost as if, with each one Lucas was feeling his way, trying to regain his footing. TPM played a lot like a Star Wars text book with some cool actions scenes. While it was enjoyable (how could ANY Star Wars movie not be enjoyable) it just seemed like characters were introduced and thrown away for no particular reason. AOTC was better but still lacked some of the elements that would have made it a classic. Anankin was too whiny and too much like a petulant teenager to every really warm up to and Padme (Natalie Portman) was so bad acting wise she jump roped from amazingly wooden to overacting one on one. This is what the other movies should have been.Lucas is able to make you feel for the characters and, despite poor dialog and stillsome shoddy acting, create connections between characters you begin to care about. The action is incredible and the technology has come so far that now, even the CGI characters are looking real. The details on Yoda and General Grevious are amazing and you forget, from time to time, that they are CGI. I loved this movie, if only because it may, in fact, resemble a movie more than any of the others. Each SW movie has been a swashbuckling tale that hinges around action, adventure, and light, comedic moments. You care about the characters but you never truly believe that they are in any real danger. ROTS is completely different. Not only do you believe the characters are in danger, you know they are and that there is no turning back. No matter what, you know that Padme is going to die, you know that Yoda is going to lose in his struggle with the Emperor, you know that Obi Wan and Yoda and the others will be forced into seclusion and you know, beyond a doubt, that Anakin will become Darth Vader. Perhaps that is the shocking part of ROTS. Most SW fans absolutely love Darth Vader. As a kid, I actually wanted him to beat Luke every time in ROTJ. It never even occurred to me that Vader could be beaten. But in this movie, you DON'T want Anakin to become Vader. You feel true remorse for the young Jedi, so afraid to lose the ones he loves, so twisted by the lies of the Emperor and so hell bent on being the greatest Jedi ever that he abandons all that is good in him to become Vader. Even the moment in the end when the mask is finally put on and Vader as we know him comes to life, even that feels hollow. One of the reasons why is because Lucas does a wonderful job of connecting Obi Wan and Anakin together in this film. You can feel and see the love they have for one another and the older/younger brother relationship they have developed. This is the relationship Lucas should have established for us in AOTC. There, the two Jedi seemed to have an extremely combative relationship where you could easily see the eventual battle coming. In ROTS, that relationship seems so genuine it hurts when it crumbles away to nothing. I would have liked more than half a movie to see that relationship blossom. Maybe then having ripped away, as it most assuredly had to be, wouldn't have seemed so quick. Also, in ROTS, you see, for the first time, characters or righteousness killed by the power and force of the Dark Side. Even the death of Qui Gon in TPM didn't seem as disturbing as the destruction of Mace Windu and the execution of the Jedi in this one. This is a very dark movie, but one of the beauties of it remains the way it subways into the original trilogy. Seeing Leia taken to Alderon and, at the end, seeing Luke, cradled by his aunt, looking over the Tatooine horizon as John William's classic score booms in the background is breathtaking. Some may say that this SW redeems the other two but I say it actually leaves you wanting more from the other two. It almost seems as if Lucas really didn't feel comfortable with this back story until ROTS. I would like to see him go back an re-do the other two movies. I would like to see him develop the emotions between characters in those movies the way he did in this one. I would have liked the rest of this trilogy to have been as engaging as this one was. Are there problems? Sure. The middle is a little long winded, Anakin's turning to the Dark Side seems a little rushed and quick. It seems a little strange that a boy so committed to the Jedi way and the Republic would turn so quickly. There are consistency problems as well, ones that only the most SW geekish amongst us would notice. In ROTJ Leia speaks of remembering her mother when she was very little. But Padme dies in child birth, so how could that be. R2-D2 knows Obi Wan very well and goes on each adventure with him and Anakin during the trilogy, yet in ANH R2 looks scared of Obi Wan who, in turn, does not seem to remember the little droid. Also, the fact that Yoda cannot see that Palpatine is the Sith Lord always seemed to me to be strange. But these are small, and no one should let any of that interfere with the movie. Th Revenge of the Sith may, in fact, be the best of the six. The original trilogy still holds a very special place in my heart, but one would be hard pressed to show that Lucas has ever done any better by his 6 part masterpiece.",10,1,6,22 May 2005
X2: X-Men United," Not bad, not great.
","Ok, I have to admit I am not a huge comic book fan or a fan of the Marvel genre. It's not that I don't like them or the idea behind them but I just, as a kid, or as an adult, ever got into them, so I think that may have a big influence on people for this movie. I know that, being a HUGE Star Wars fan I can enjoy the new movies more then people who were just casual fans. But anyway, heres what I think. The things I liked: Special effects are awsome once again. The beginning sequence with Nightcrawler is great, the way he appears and dissappears is amazing. The scene with Pyro, where he takes on the entire Colorado PD, the scene where the school is overrun and you see the different kids power. That stuff is awsome.The things I didn't like: The movie dragged. This is not as exciting as the first. It is long and drawn out. I understand that directors always are looking to make MORE then an action film, but in the end isn't that what we want? A film filled with fights, explosions, and strange creatures doing strange things? This movie has bits and pieces of that but doesn't reall focus on it too much. And the characters are old, I don't like them. The only new character intorduced in this film is Nightcrawler who has one good scene where you get to see what he is made of, and then that is it. I dislike Storm, Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Charles Xavier. They are boring characters with boring powers. Cyclops is hardly in this movie at all, which is good, and Xavier plays basically Jean Luc in a wheel chair this whole movie, getting into a psychological battle that puts the cat to sleep wih some Sixth Sense looking mutant. Wolverine, as usual, is the lynchpin of the movie and he carries it throughout. But even the bad guys. Last time around there was Toad, with his long tongue, and the lion looking guy, whose name escapes me. Now? Magnito and Mystique, who is hot as all hell, but in the end the idea of a shape shifter as her power is not that appealing. No new villians except for Special Forces General Striker? All these Xmen charaters and we only get Nightcrawler whose action is over within the forst 10 minutes? What a joke. And this Rogue character? Does she have any point in the comics cause she sure as hell doesn't in these movies. All these Xmen charaters and we get a girl with a horribly infectious rash to focus on. I don't CARE about her or whether or not she can ever touch anyone. I hope she doesn't. And the girl who plays her? Take a step back Heather Graham there might be a worse actress on the face of the earth then you. I cannot stand that ROGUE character and it is as if they HAVE to try and put things in the movie to make her interesting. Take her out and put in a charater with some really cool powers, that can do something interesting besides spread some sort of weird disease. And that also goes for Jean Grey. My God could there be a more useless character. SPOILER!!!!!!!! Figured I would put that in there about Grey, but she supposedly dies in the end, something I hope sticks but I know will not in the end. She'll be back, somehow, and the movie will be the worse for the wear for it. She is annoying, her powers amazingly uninteresting considering another character in the movie, Xavier, has the same power, and her love affair with Cyclops and Wolverine is stupid. Is the movie horrible? No, but it is just another high budget, high octane Hollywood movie that is big on hype and low on results. Here is to hoping that this is not a prelude to things to come for this summer. Last summer was a such a good one for movies, and the year before so bad, that hopefully this year marks its own terroritory with Martix and Hulk and the others coming out. But X2 is not the banner movie of the year so far.",Null,0,1,5 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best one of the lot
","I don't know what to say about this film. I don't know where to begin. I don't know what to focus on, think on, obsess on first, as I have never seen a film so complete, so nearly perfect, that it almost calls for no words at all. I usually have a lot to say, thinking, and sometimes rightfully so, that the better a piece of art the more one should dissect it. Make no mistake, this is a piece of art. The whole trilogy, all three movies, are breathtaking pieces of creativity at its highest. It is what Aristotle considered 'high art' and it makes no apology for making its audience think, while giving them enough visual effects to just astonish a a dumbfounded movie theatre. While all three pieces are art, this last film is the Mona Lisa of the group. I adored Fellowship, loved Twin Towers but found some of the magic gone, and have been changed by Return of the King. This movie tried to do so many things, which usually makes for a choppy, chaotic movie going experience. Movies that attempt too much usually in the end resemble politicians trying to be everything to everyone. By the end no one wants anything to do with them. Consider this the exception to the rule. It tries to be a character driven drama, which is succeeds in doing. It tries to be an action packed, visual effects masterpiece, which it succeeds in doing. And finally, it attempts to interject enough humor and lighthearted attitude to keep the audience from become enveloped in a dark cloud of its own, which it also succeeds in doing. Oh yes, and one more thing: it attempts the greatest challenge of them all, how to turn a literary classic, of such utter complexity that no one else has ever attempted it, into a classic piece of film, while staying true to the books themselves, and in this the film succeeds beyond my wildest dreams. The struggle in this last film is so desperate, the drain so apparent on all the warriors faces, that even those of us who know the end by heart still grimace as our heros face peril after peril. And our characters connect with each of us, completely. We feel for each one. We know each ones strengths and weakness's, and we fear that one or two may, in the end, not make it. I can imagine what it must be like to fall in love with these movies having never read the books, having never fallen in love with the world Tolkien created on page. To not know what is going to happen, who is going to live and who is going to die, must be a nerve racking experience in this film. One I envy in some ways, though the love of the books is far greater and more fullfilling then anything experienced in the theatre. No, this film keeps the book to heart, and respects the author, the true imagination behind the world we see on the screen. So many films today, taken from extrodinary novels, try too hard to distance themselves from the writer and their vision. Each one inevitably fails miserably. But this film, and all three in fact, stay as close as possible to the novel that one would suspect Tolkien is smiling to himself somewhere right now. I could write another 1000 words on the acting in this film, which should eventually be recognized, and the direction of such complex movies that require so many story lines to blend seamlessly, but that almost takes away from the beauty of this film. You see, at the end of this movie you don't feel as if you have watched a story, a fictional tale involving fake characters. Instead, you feel attached. You feel one with the people who have sweat and suffered in the screen above. There are no actors to congratulate because these are real people, living real adventures, adventures we have the privilege to ease drop on. I am sad these films are over, sadder then I have ever been before. I will eventually own these movies, and eventually, on a rainy or snowy day, I will watch all three in succession. But I will never again have the pleasure to experience these movies for the first time. I will never again be able to feel that pit in my stomach as moments are revealed and characters become heros. I will never again feel the way I do tonight, and that makes me sad. But for all of you who have not seen this movie yet, those feelings await you.",10,0,1,18 December 2003
The Matrix," GREAT SCI-FI
","I am not, what you would call, a big Keanu Reeves fan, but this movie was excellent. The story line was wonderfully original, taking the Terminator plot line to new levels, and the acting was terrific. Reeves did a great job as the confused NEO who is thrown into this world unsuspecting of anything to come, and his end fight with the Agent Smith is one of the only times I ever believed Reeves could be a 'hard a%%'. The actor who played Agent Smith was a great villian and the actress who played Trinity did an outstanding job. Though the story can be confusing at times, and the constant references to what is real and what is not can spin your head, the movie makes up for it with amazing action sequences and some of the best effects I have seen in year. Overall, this should be a must see for any avid movie goer.",Null,0,0,15 May 1999
