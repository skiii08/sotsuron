Casablanca," They just don't make 'em like this anymore!!
","With its perfect mix of drama, romance, excitement and comedy, Casablanca grips from beginning to heart-breaking end. Legendary stars such as Bogart, Bergman and Henreid giving career best performances add yet more magic to the experience. A movie that puts most modern romantic films to shame, it would be a cold soul indeed who could watch the ending without crying. Casablanca truly deserves its reputation as one of the greatest movies of all time.",10,0,0,17 July 2000
The Godfather: Part II," Even better than the first? Surely not!
","The first Godfather movie was stunning. This one is simply breathtakingly good. Drawing parallels between the initial growth of the Corleone empire under young Vito for relatively noble reasons, and the greed and corruption that brings the family close to self-destruction under Michael, the film takes everything that was great about the first movie and builds upon it. A rare example of a sequel that is actually better than the original.",10,0,0,17 July 2000
Die Hard," Probably the best action movie of the 80's.
","Bruce Willis was a bit of a joke before this film was first released. A TV star from a once successful show, unproven as a movie star, demanding several million to star in a big budget action movie - people were booing and throwing popcorn at the screen when only the trailer was showing. Little did they know... Mr Willis may have made a few suspect choices in his film roles over the years ('North' and, Heaven help us, 'The Bonfire of the Vanities'), but Die Hard was probably the best career move he will make. Ever. James Bond was getting a bit tedious, Rambo was nothing more than an indestructable muscle-bound meathead, the Eighties needed a real action hero. Step forward John McClane. When we first meet him, we immediately know this is a guy we can trust. While James Bond would just sit calmly sipping his cocktail, McClane is tense after a long flight - he's not too keen on flying. This instantly shows that he's mortal and not some sort of machine that is only operative when there are bad guys to despatch. On his drive from the airport, we find out more about his human side. He's a male chauvanist because he doesn't have any real faith in his wife's ability to be independent in her chosen career. The way he talks about her to the driver of his limo tells us that he does genuinely miss her. When he gets to the office block, the fact that Holly is registered under her maiden name hurts his pride leading to an angry (and instantly regrettable) argument later on. In case we were worried that this guy was abit too touchy-feely to be a real hero, we see him briefly spying on an unidentified, naked bimbo in an adjacent building. Our kinda guy!At first, the bad guys show themselves to be highly efficient, ruthless and very cool (in direct contrast to our all too human hero?). Chief Baddie Alan Rickman puts such a fantastic performance that he nearly walks away with the film (as he did a couple of years later with the Robin Hood movie), but he doesn't quite steal it away from Mr Willis. Polishing off the bad guys whilst uttering a corny pun wearing a vest designed to show off his pecs as much as possible, and injuries that get more severe with each increasingly improbable set-piece, Bruce becomes the action hero blue-print for the next decade. Not only that but the film itself practically invented the 90's big-budget blockbuster two years before that decade had even began. In addition to the splendid performances we have brilliant direction by John McTiernan, a superb score by Michael Kamen, and almost flawless special effects.The film is not without its bad points: Firstly, would you remove your shoes and socks and 'make fists with your toes' on the advice of a complete stranger? Didn't think so. You might consider the film to be a little bit far fetched. Well, fair enough. If you want social realism or politics watch an Oliver Stone film. Die Hard is escapism, entertainment and fun. And as such its the best of its kind.",Null,0,0,25 July 2000
Die Hard," Easily the best action movie of the 80's!
","With assured direction from John McTiernan, a superb score by Michael Kamen and excellent special effects (by pre CGI standards), this film practically re-invented the action movie. And boy did we action fans need it. James Bond was losing his appeal, Rambo was nothing more than a charmless, mono-syllabic walking machine-gun and Arnie was still in the early days of his rise to the top of Hollywood. The action genre needed help. That help came in the unlikely form of Bruce Willis. Oh dear. Since Moonlighting finished, Bruce's big screen output left a lot to be desired up to this point ('Blind Date', anyone?). Some thought it a bit cheeky of our Mr Willis to be demanding a few million dollars to appear as New York cop John McClane. In fact, some US cinema audiences started to jeer and throw popcorn at the screen when the trailer for Die Hard was shown. If only they knew... Basically, Die Hard turned Bruce Willis into a genuine movie star. In a white vest that gets grubbier by the minute, a snappy gag for every villain despatched and injuries that get more severe with each increasingly improbable set-piece, John McClane became the blueprint for action heroes over the next decade. For the first time in a long while we had an action hero who was human (he's afraid to fly, he gets scared when the villains shoot at him, and most importantly, his marriage is a mess). From the moment we meet him, stressed out after a long plane journey, we know this is a guy we can trust. Thanks to the sequels, it's hard to imagine anyone but Willis in the role of McClane but there's far more to Die Hard's success than it's leading man. In films like this there is a tendency to make the villains nothing more than cannon fodder. When they first appear in Die Hard, they give the impression of an expertly trained, highly disciplined and well organised team of guys-to-be-shot-by-Bruce. However, as the film progresses, they actually develop individual personalities. Special mentions should go to Clarence Gilyard Jr as Theo, the excitable Technical expert. Also Alexander Gudonov does a wonderfully snarling chief henchman/second-in-command. Last, but certainly not least, Alan Rickman as chief villain Hans Gruber shows exactly why he has since developed a reputation for stealing films right out from under the stars' noses. Bruce has to work hard to stop Rickman from overshadowing him but he just about pulls it off (unlike Kevin Costner who, apparently, had Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves re-edited so that Rickman's Sherrif of Nottingham didn't wipe Costner's plank Robin off the screen - it didn't work though). It's not just the characters that makes this film work. The action set-pieces are directed with impeccable style and panache by John McTiernan. This is probably the man we have to thank for action movie that practically re-invented the Big Budget 90's Hollywood Blockbuster two years before that decade had even begun. That's not to say that film is perfect. Certain aspects of the plot are painfully contrived - 'fists with your toes'. Yeah, right. The police and other law enforcement agencies are worryingly inept, with the obvious exception of Al, Bruce's buddie on the outside. There's also the old 'the villain is dead....whooops, no he isn't' device at the end which was as much a cliche in 1988 as it is now.Some people might criticise Die Hard on the grounds that it's too far-fetched. Fair enough, it is. If you want serious social issues and politics, then watch an Oliver Stone movie. If you want brilliant escapism and fantastic entertainment, you should watch Die Hard - it's the best of it's kind",Null,0,0,25 July 2000
The Godfather," A movie you cannot refuse!
","With many classic moments, amazing performances, a gripping narrative, as well as incredibly assured direction by Francis Ford Coppola, this film is truly unmissable. Any self respecting film fan who has not seen this film should rectify that without delay.",9,0,1,17 July 2000
