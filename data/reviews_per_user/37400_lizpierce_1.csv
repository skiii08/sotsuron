The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Leaves you breathless
","It's hard to describe this movie in just 1,000 words but I'll try to keep it short. I'm a huge fan of the books, but I've been disappointed with the last two movies so my hopes weren't that high for this one. I shouldn't have worried. Breaking Dawn blew me away from the first scene. Stewart is finally acting, which is one of the biggest reasons why this movie is so much better than the others. She portrays Bella in a way that is so close to the book, and it's wonderful to see her and Pattinson playing lovers that are so, so, so in love. The fact that Bill Condon (director) gave the happy couple so much time to be just that, happy, makes you really believe in their love and it makes you understand why they can't live without each other. Such an important part (or THE most important thing I should say) but something that the previous directors have failed in showing. This movie takes you from a beautiful wedding, complete with the most hilarious toasts (Jessica and Charlie) wonderful music, stunning dresses and declarations of love that will touch everyone's hearts, to South America for a sexy, funny and exciting honeymoon where we see heartfelt smiles, kissing, cuddling and teasing along with the epic headboard breaking scene. It then settles back in Forks, where we get to witness the most terrifying pregnancy imaginable. The special effects team deserve an Oscar for the work they've done on making Stewart look like she's slowly fading away.The moments leading up to the birth scene are actually scarier than the scene itself. It really is a horror film towards the end, and some scenes should maybe have been rated R. It ends in the perfect place, such a natural and obvious cut. I am so thankful that Breaking Dawn has been split into two parts, because I can't imagine even once scene in this part that could have been skipped. Condon is a genius.",10,135,278,16 November 2011
