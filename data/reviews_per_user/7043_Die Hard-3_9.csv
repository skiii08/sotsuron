The Rock," Absolutely incredible
","Best action movie I have ever seen, along with Face/Off. What more can I say. Action: great. Car chase: great. Plot: Great. Acting: Great. What more could you ask for in a movie. 94 out of 100.",9,1,1,26 January 1999
The Fifth Element," Trashy
","I have read all the other reviews on this page about this film, most of them saying it is terrific, greatest movie ever, but in my mind, nothing could be further from the truth.  I found this film to be a piece of garbage and totally absurd.  Zorg is one of the stupidest villiais I have ever seen, and this film doesn't amount to much.  The ending's OK, but the majority was pure trash.  At the beginning, I was giving it a chance, despite how bad it seemed, but throughout the absurdity of the film just kept growing.  Chris Tucker's character is stupid, annoying, absurd, and unnecessary in this movie, his screaming all the time still building on the absurdity.  After Luc Besson's 'The Professional', which is a great film, and after seeing the 'Die Hard Trilogy', which are some of the best movies around, I had high expectations because of the clashing of Bruce Willis and Luc Besson.  But the film was horrid.  A very disappointing film that should be avoided at all costs by everyone.",4,12,26,19 October 1998
LÃ©on: The Professional," A witty film
","A great and witty film about how a hitman really might be.  A hitman really would kill without emotion, just doing his job.  Great plot combined with great acting, with some brutal, but not too bad, violence.  The ending is not disappointing, and I thought that the film was very good.  Jean Reno's acting performance is fine, as is the girl who played Mathilda, and Gary Oldman is OK.  The beginning of the film is great, where he turns up at a house, and moves without sound, and kills without remorse.  A good film experience that I recommend.",7,0,5,19 October 1998
Armageddon," Not much story, lots of special effects
","As I said above, very little story, but plenty of special effects.  The special effects are stunning, and this movie is action all the way, which is probably why I like it.  The story is this: A team of the best oil -drillers in the world go into space to drill, drop a nuke into the middle of the asteroid, escape, and blow up the asteroid, which is the size  of Texas.  Paris and New York get very battered by incoming meteor showers.  Those scenes are very spectacular.  If you're looking for a movie with a lot of special-effects, and you are an action fan, this is the film for you.  This movie is fast-paced, but still lasts 2 1/2 hours.  The only thing I thought was ludicrously silly was after a scene where Bruce Willis was shooting golf balls at Greenpeace.  Afterwards he finds out his best driller is in a relationship with his daughter and he goes after Ben Affleck with a gun and repeatedly shoots at him.  That was very silly, but the rest of the movie was good enough to redeem it from that scene.",8,1,1,15 September 1998
Independence Day," Better than average
","When I first saw 'ID4', I thought it was OK, but the second time I saw it, it was actually a lot better.  The spaceships were of enormous size and the effects are terrific, and the acting was OK.  Every alien in the whole species comes towards Earth to attack, and eliminate every being on the planet, so that they can consume every natural resource and then move on to another planet.  Main defenders are the President (Bill Pullman), who is in charge, David Levinson, a cable guy (Jeff Goldblum) who finds out how to get through the alien technology, and Captain Steve Hillard of the Air Force (Will Smith) who hates those aliens shooting green s**t at him.  Everyone fighting back against the aliens is probably the best part in the film, and the characters were fairly well known by the end of the film, which isn't really normal for a big, expensive, special-effects blockbuster.",7,0,0,17 October 1998
Dumb and Dumber," Very funny
","The comedy of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in 'Dumb & Dumber' is very funny. It is full of humour with sometimes crude jokes, but often things like 'It's OK, I'm a limo driver!'.  When I watched this with my friends, we were laughing left and right and all around a lot.  It is very funny.  8 out of 10.",8,0,0,21 October 1998
Die Hard," The mother of all action movies
","The modern action genre begins here with two words that will always be associated with action, Die Hard.  Probably the best movie ever stars Bruce Willis and will soon have spurned 3 sequels.  A group of twelve terrorists including Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and Karl (Alexander Godunov) hold 30 executives hostage in an office building.  What do they want? $640,000,000. They are armed with missiles and rockets which they fire at an unfortunate LAPD.  The only man free roaming the building with only his service revolver is NYPD cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) who came to LA to visit his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) for Christmas.  The LAPD, led by Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne Robinson (Paul Gleason) are disbelieving and the only one on John's side is Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson). Explosions are great, but it is slow at times.  Overall, Die Hard is a thrilling ride through 40 stories of sheer adventure.",8,1,2,14 September 1998
The Silence of the Lambs," Boring
","Such a boring movie.  Not much seemed to happen until the end, which was OK. The reason behind why the guy was killing the ladies was the stupidest thing I have ever heard.  Hannibal Lecter's character and his escape scene were really the only things I liked in the whole film.  It pretty much sucked.",4,3,15,17 October 1998
Speed," A terrific action blockbuster
","A purely new idea comes out of Hollywood, and it makes a terrific action film.  Keanu Reeves was a good choice for the main role as Jack Traven, and he plays it well.  Dennis Hopper and Sandra Bullock were also well cast. The plot is simple but is also great, as are the characters and special effects and explosions  .If this were an average film, you would think it would end with the bus, but no, they give you more, and this film is totally exhilarating.  If you see it, you'll agree.  It is a great film that rates 9 out of 10 on my scale.  I highly recommend 'Speed'.  The sequel is fairly good but doesn't compare with the original.",9,1,1,19 October 1998
