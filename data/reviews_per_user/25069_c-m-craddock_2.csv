The Perks of Being a Wallflower," This is one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen
",This movie feels so real and it so relatable that you feel nostalgic watching it. As someone who had a very hard time in high school. I love the beauty of it. This movie leaves me in tears and somehow feeling light and wonderful at the same time.,10,2,3,14 March 2020
Joker," What a waste
",I Have rarely been as disappointed in a movie as i have been with this one. I went in expecting a deep interesting and entertaining movie. What i got was an awkward incredibly boring film. All that hype for something that is 60% the joker being awkward. I kept waiting for it to pick up and become interesting. I was expecting something on the level with Heath Ledgers joker but it failed to gain my interest in the least. Like many critically acclaimed films this movie was a complete joke to me.,1,51,113,12 October 2019
