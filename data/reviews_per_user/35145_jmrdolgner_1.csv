The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," It's Twilight. You already know if you like it.
","Here's the good, the bad, and I don't know what.|GOOD|: As with any book-to-movie adaptation, things will get left out, changed, or even added in. I have no complaints about how this was done in Breaking Dawn - Part 1. All the major points were there and it all still made sense. The music worked well throughout the movie, particularly during the wedding scene. Their reuse of 'Flightless Bird, American Mouth' didn't feel cheap. It felt appropriate for the scene.Kudos to the makeup artist for when Bella was pregnant. She looked truly skeletal, which made for good contrast during her vampire transformation. Bella's transformation sequence was interesting to watch. The baby looked better than I had expected, and the glimpses into what she will look like later were nice. It made Jacob's imprinting less creepy than some people make it sound.The overlapping chaotic voices of the wolf pack was great. We know that the pack can hear all of each other's thoughts and you can't exactly turn your brain off, so everyone's voice overlapping made sense.There were some memorable funny moments that kept the movie from being completely cancerous. The best of which was arguably the toasts during the reception. It was nice for them to be awkward on purpose (Emmet's sleeping line) rather than the unintentional awkward prominent in the films.|BAD|: I have given up the hope that certain actors will open their mouths to speak and stop mumbling their lines. When I first heard that Breaking Dawn was being split into two movies, I must admit that the first thing I said was 'Well of course. How else will they fit in the horrible pauses between each line?'. This is the fourth movie however and I suppose I should be used to it. At the other end of the spectrum, Some of the wolf voices were so over the top I had to laugh at them. It was mostly Sam, a bit of Jacob and a few other nameless wolves who thought they were in a Disney movie. Hopefully they'll be able to re-record that scene for the DVD. The scene also felt compacted. Jacob and Seth being made to bow down and Jacob becoming Alpha could have been dragged out longer. It would have been nice to have a scene before that with the wolves talking just to get the audience used to it. Perhaps there will be some of that in the next movie. I also hope some of the sound effects will be taken out in the DVD. The squelchy chompy noises when Edward was biting Bella were so weird it was humorous.|UP IN THE AIR|: I'm not sure about the pre-wedding dream sequence. I don't think it was necessary and looking back to the book There was a different dream there that I would much rather have seen. But that would have required that they talk about immortal children at some point before then which I don't think would have fit in well with the dialogue. The wedding night was just as I'd expected. I was more interested in Bella's preparations and freak out than the actual sex in both the book and the movie, but that may be just me. When it showed the venom spreading through Bella's system my first thought was 'House?' but after I got over that it was okay. the transformation sequence could have been made to look more organic. It was not immediately apparent that this was more of a transition over a three day period.I'm thinking that most of the wolf fights they added in most of the movies were just for the guys who were dragged to the theatre against their will.|Final Thoughts|: If you liked the other Twilight movies, you will like this one. If you're reading this review before you see the movie, There's a clip in the middle of the credits. stick around for that. It's cool. If you don't like the Twilight movies, this isn't going to change your mind. (rant)and while I'm thinking about it. This is movie four! You should know whether or not you like it by now. If you don't like it, why did you see it? More importantly, why are you trolling the forums about it. Just ignore it.(end-rant) In my opinion, these movies have been getting better with each one and Breaking Dawn - Part 1 did not deviate from that pattern.",7,0,6,28 December 2011
