Blade Runner 2049," I Really Have Seen Things.....
","Given the length of this film, coupled with the acclaimed visuals, I decided not to watch this at my local IMAX when it was released 2 years ago because I knew it would demand my complete and utter attention.As a consequence I waited a good year for the Blu Ray to be released and spent one evening totally absorbed and 'ready' for the BR2049 experience via my TV and 7:1 sound system.During this time I had read many many reviews of the film, both from professional sources, fans and the general public. The consensus being that the film is indeed visually impressive, but was also slow, indulgent and not very involving. But then I recall reading similar reviews when the originally Blade Runner was released back in 1982, but that never deterred me from watching and later fully applauding such a marvelously constructed film on so many levels.So I watched 2049 at home, and yes, it blew me away visually! So much so that I completely lost track of time, and the 160 odd minutes felt more like 60 so engrossing was the film. However, when the final credits rolled I did think to myself: 'well what have I really learnt here? What was the plot about again?' 'Who was that character and what did he/she do again?'So enraptured with the visual sfx and hardware that the story felt like an afterthought. So a week later I did the same again, but this time I wore wireless headphones rather than my sound system; and this time the story really began to make sense. I also realised how character-driven this film really is, and you really have to watch and rewatch the film to appreciate the nuances of each and every one of them.I have since watched the film from home at least 6 times, and I still learn something new. It is a truly amazing film, even if the plot isn't quite as complex as it tries to be; and I never really liked the fight sequence at the end of the film either.That said, Gosling, Ford,Armas,Hoeks and in particular director,Denis Villeneuve all do an exceptional job, as well as making BR2049 a worthy sequel to such a cult film.",9,2,8,17 March 2019
Love and Death," Woody at his historical, or should that be, hysterical best!
","For me Love & Death and Sleeper were Allen's zenith for slapstick, one-liner comic-gag comedy. After the relatively immature but amusing Bananas & Everything You always Wanted To Know About Sex, Allen goes up a notch in the intellectual comedy stakes to produce this fine send-up of Russian culture & historical caricature.Even though some of the one-liner jokes don't always come off it doesn't matter because you never really get chance to think too much about how droll it is because Allen has another half dozen gags waiting in the wings.But I've often found that Allen works best when he has a foil for his anarchic humour: and thank the Lord he managed to find the wonderful talent of Ms Keaton. She may not be his intellectual equal but she can run him to ground in nearly everything else. She has a kind of naive charm in this movie, always daydreaming, never really listening to Allen's mutterings & jabberings. And with this naivity brings warmth, humility and a general sense of well being.At the same time Allen can release all his pentup emotions, fears, neo-neurosis to Keaton knowing full well that she wouldn't have a single notion as to what he was on about.And thats what makes this partnership so durable whether it be here in Love & Death, or Sleeper, Annie Hall or Manhattan Murder Mystery. The scripts may vary but they're held together by the spontaneity of the two stars.It should be said also that Love & Death breaks new ground for Allen, because even though he still relies on the childish humour of his earlier films, it is also quite clear that he is more forthcoming with his angst against a problematic world. His philosophic nuances dominate a lot of the film, which he will put to more practical use in his latter films like Annie Hall & Manhattan. But here he gets the mix between jokes & existentualism just right.Love & Death is quite literally a laugh a minute. Whatever people may say about his recent personal problems it cannot be denied that this guy is a pure talent and should be cherished for what he is - a man that makes the world a happier place, if only for a few hours!****/*****",6,33,37,21 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thank God for IMDB Guidelines!!!!
","At a rather crusty 39 years of age I can say I grew up on Star Wars. From those heady days of 1977/78 I remember going to my local movie house and watching Star Wars IV in Widescreen Dolby. God...that first five minutes will live with me for ever....those battle cruisers slowly crawling into the screen from above almost made me wet myself. I knew then I was hooked by the Star Wars franchise.The Empire Strikes Back is my personal favourite since there's a lot more time to develop the characters and their particular  mannerisms, coupled with a rip-roaring sfx-supported adventure. (I'm sure my jaw dropped between my knees when old Darth announced to Luke that he was his old man!)Return of the Jedi is my least favourite even though the sfx were more defined & flexible back then. But the film stank of corporatism & product-placement, especially those irritating Ewoks.But after a 17 year wait I was convinced Lucas would turn it around again and emphasise the drama in PM rather than any external commercial forces.The hype swept us along until finally the film arrived on UK shores. I was one of the first to queue up, hoping against hope that  the hype was no mirage of wishful thinking!Oh dear! With the exception of the first dazzling 10 minutes this film stunk to high heaven. I guess those people too young to have grown up with the original SW trio loved this; but for me, and perhaps many others, PM was dreadful.I left the cinema cursing LucasArts and the way he had allegedly sold out to the money men. No Ewoks to speak of but that was quickly substituted by Jar Jar Binks.Fortunately the IMDB guidelines prevent me from truly venting my feelings for the film in general and Binks in particular. I hate this film and judging by the older audience I shared the movie with they did too.17 years of waiting & hoping for something special but nothing has changed and Lucas has finally lost the plot.It's a slim hope that he will take on board some of the genuine negativity from his fans and prove us all wrong by producing an awesome Star Wars 2'The Force is (no longer) strong in this one!' */*****",Null,1,2,17 June 2000
Spartacus," 'I AM SPARTACUS!!!' And I was moved to tears!
","A truly moving portrayal of slavery in Roman Times, and one man's self determination to do something about it, against impossible odds!Spartacus is a classic amongst the classics. Not quite so pompous as Ben Hur; not so overdone as Ten Commandments. Spartacus offers a comfortable middleway between being a cultured movie & mass-acceptance movie.Kubrick's direction has never been better, especially during the final battle scenes, and the rather subtle & discreet scene between Olivier & Curtis sharing a bath together - a lot of the cryptic dialogue between  the two probably went straight over the heads of a lot of viewers, myself included initially.But this is the work of Kubrick. Not only can he provide the audience with what they want to see - action, pathos, drama etc; by the same token he can provide us with little hidden delicacies that tease us & tempt us, once we've unravelled their meaning.I was also taken by the wonderful score by Alex North, especially at the very beginning during the title sequence.The actors all take a share of the spoils. Simmons, Ustinov, Curtis, even the cameo from Woodie Strode, play with a certain majesty that is needed for a weighty film such as this. Kubrick knows how to tap the best out of some actors, and here is no exception.Of course the true honours are shared by Olivier and Douglas. In a way the characters they play is like a metaphor of their real acting abilities.We have in the red corner, Laurence Olivier, playing the sweeping & majestic Crassus, leader of Rome (in all but name), who rides his white horse with an air of arrogance & godliness and you feel could crush Spartacus with one hand. And we all know Olivier's true acting pedigree both on stage & on film, be it Shakespeare or a ruthless Nazi dentist, Olivier always has that aura of class about him.While in the blue corner, Kirk Douglas, playing Spartacus, the David to Olivier's Goliath. But a man, a little man, who stands alone in defiance of dictatorship, and almost succeeds. And then we can contrast Douglas' films and see that even though his portfolio is not quite so grand he does & has produced/acted in a great number of memorable movies.
It's not often I shed a tear at the movies but after the final battle scene, the victorious Crassus wants to know who Spartacus is amongst the walking wounded. One by one they stand up and declare 'I, am Spartacus!' while Douglas looked on, the tears rolling down my face!Spartacus is perhaps slightly over hyped, but its a very good & thought provoking movie for all that.****/*****",9,1,2,3 July 2000
Se7en," David Fincher rises from his Alien Ashes and delivers Se7en
","After the unfortunate debacle with Alien3 (they couldn't even get the title right since a lot of viewers thought it was Alien Cubed..but never mind!), David Fincher fights back with a superbly crafted murder/mystery which goes beyond the norm (and others would add, the pail) for police crime movies.Not a particularly complex story - all we have is a typical Mr Average Man who has finally had enough of present day society's steep decline into...well, as the title almost suggests....the Seven Deadly Sins.His grisly murders represent each Sin and only a soon-to-be-retired police detective who '...can't get involved...' (skillfully played by Morgan Freeman) and his young upstart sidekick (Brad Pitt) manage to unravel the case, but at huge personal cost to both.Its difficult to know where to start when praising such a brilliant film. But to begin with some of Fincher's old Alien3 directing habits are carried into this film. Most of the story is set in miserable, dank, wet and gloomy places - but this isn't a complaint but only adds to the foreboding that awaits us. You feel as if you're swimming in a pool of slime trying to keep afloat as Fincher moves from one scene to another, never letting the viewer, or indeed the main characters time to take a breath.Fortunately Fincher doesn't go over the top showing us every murder in explicit detail. He knows we are intelligent enough to work out in our own fetid imaginations what the camera doesn't allow us to see. But having said that, the corpses that we do see would make even Dirty Harry choke!Editing & lighting also go hand in hand with the cinematography, so too does the splatter-punk music score that surrounds the start & finish of the film. In fact its like a conspiracy against the audience - all the unit directors of the film crew (art, sound,2nd unit, editing, score etc) have ganged up with Fincher to give the viewer a real hard time - a feeling of truly being out there with Freeman & Pitt.Morgan Freeman is, as always, a pleasure to watch. He seems to have hit all the right moves these last few years, especially in the underrated Shawshank Redemption. His character is very slow, methodical, patient...all those things his partner, Brad Pitt, lacks so glaringly,Pitt is perfect for the young brash detective. The two cops remind me of reading a book - Freeman plays the cop page by page by page never wanting to cut a corner or skip a detail; while Pitt plays his character chapter by chapter, ever moving forward, not having the patience to look at the minute details on each page...and boy does he get the Early Morning Wakeup Call at the end of the film!!!!But to my mind, Kevin Spacey, who plays Jon Doe, is the real king player here. Critically acclaimed in The Usual Suspects, LA Confidential & Glengarry Glen Ross), Spacey pulls off yet another masterclass act here.He is not a madman or psychopath (as Brad Pitt feels he is) even though his crimes would make you think otherwise. Instead he is just a well-educated citizen who has simply had enough of seeing society fall apart outside his front door, and the police & the courts are seen as being impotent to do anything about it.Spacey knows what Fincher wants from his character and plays it with relish; similar to John Malkovich's Mitch Leary character in Clint Eastwood's In the Line of Fire.This isn't a glamour film that will make you glow & smile when you leave the theatre. This film wants to crush you with the sordid reality of what is actually happening to us all out there - a film that tells it as it is, and not as Hollywood wants us to view the world from their glittering perspective.Se7en is a film where other detective films should be judged. It's unforgiving & relentless but a visual masterpiece for all that...and as for the ending....well.....*****/*****",9,0,0,18 June 2000
Akira," Marvellous Japanese Anime - a cross between Blade Runner & Mad Max and so much more!
","Although 12 years old now, and looking a little dated (CEL being replaced by the rather more sterile & lifeless CGI), Akira is the grand-daddy of all Japanese Anime films.I only saw it by accident on TV about four years ago. Flicking idly through the channels one night until I saw what looked liked a rather detailed 'cartoon' strip, which later turned out to be the full majesty of Akira.However, I'd missed about 30 minutes of the film and by the end I was no more the wiser as to what had happened and what it all meant. But in spite of my confusion & ignorance I was simply in awe at the beautiful CEL rendering of a post-war Neo Tokyo.I had to join a Manga organization to find out where to buy this movie, and when I did I couldn't get home quick enough. Fortunately this was the subtitled version (I have yet to see the dubbed version and in a way I'm glad because usually dubbed films often ruin the whole 'feel' of the film)It is, however, hard work to follow. The story is very detailed and moderately convoluted, not helped by having to read the subtitles while still keeping an eye on what's going on above. It took me at least 4 or 5 repeat viewings to finally get comfortable with the involved storyline but its well worth it in the end, although the last 20 or so minutes does go marginally anal with itself, and just pulls the film down from being a true classic.It should be  remembered that this film is only part of a long-going story of Akira comics, so it's not surprising that our western eyes are a little confused with some of the sub plots & subtle Japanese spiritual & cultural meanings within the film that are never fully explained away.Many have compared it to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, not so much with regards the story of course but on the grand visualization of some neo city of the future with its technology & artificial human society.But IMHO, Akira supercedes even BR not only visually but also at a sub conscious level. Blade Runner lacks any real human attachment or emotional drive, whilst Akira makes you feel part of the crowd looking on at the goings on of a bunch of motor bike riding kids causing mayhem in the streets of Tokyo, but in fact could be any city you wish really.Personally I prefer Ghost In the Shell, Cyber City & PATLABOR 2, closely followed by Akira, in that order of preference. But Akira is perhaps the most intelligent of these and all the other anime/manga films out there.Don't confuse this kind of 'cartoon' with the likes of Pokemon, there is simply a world...no, a galaxy of difference between the two genres. Akira is a tough, brutal, violent & grim film that will leave you both perplexed & confused by the end. But even if you don't want to be too involved with the story line its worth seeing simply for the majesty of the animation alone.

Mississippi Burning," Symbolic Burning Crosses and Simplistic Storytelling
","Three civil rights activists (2 blacks, 1 white) go missing & presumed murdered by white racists (the Klu Klux Klan) in some small town in the heart of Mississippi during the race protests of 1964 .Enter two FBI men from the North - Hackman (the bad cop, who used to be a town sherrif in the area many years ago but now  hunts bigger fish whether it be within the law or otherwise ) and Willem Defoe (the good cop trying to set the world to rights with the belief that even racists can't be all that evil to want to kill).They investigate the case using the rules laid out by the pragmatic and by-the-book Defoe. But the townsfolk aren't quite so co-operative or helpful and the two agents seem to spend more time arguing with each other over tactics or visiting burnt out homes, farms & churches belonging to the oppressed blacks in the area than getting any nearer to solving the crime.Even with a hundred other FBI agents brought in to help out both Defoe & Hackman find it hard to get witnesses to speak up and offer any leads regarding the three young missing persons.Eventually Hackman befriends the wife of one of the town's police officers (and suspected KKK member), wonderfully played by the ever-dependable Frances McDormand (of Fargo and Blood Simple fame). Through her Hackman learns that most of the police officers and leading townsfolk are KKK members and that the 3 activists were murdered & buried in a nearby quarry pit.With the bodies exhumed all Hackman & Defoe need to close the case are the murderers, but to get what they want they have to play by Hackman's rules this time.....A highly controversial film for its day (1988). Initially it was a certainty to win a host of Academy Awards for its virtuous storytelling. But various black groups protested that the film was flawed,uneven and possibly even racist. They also argued that the film portrayed the black townsfolk as defenceless, ignorant & backward, having to rely on two white FBI agents from out of town to help them win them justice.It is fair to say that they have a point. It struck me that for most of the time the blacks portrayed in the film were blatantly stereotyped as either churchgoers, gospel singers, cotton-pickers or ignorant illiterates.
This major complaint coupled with protests from white Southerners angry at being seeing as just a bunch of hick rednecks, ended any realistic chance the film had of winning any award at all.British director, Alan Parker took a very simplistic view of some true events the film is supposedly based on. It is true to say that the acting from both Defoe and especially Hackman is top notch, the photography and film score excellent coupled with the overall pace of the film makes for a very entertaining viewing. However, it is to the content of the film that counts most and this is where Parker's limited knowledge of the civil rights protests in the Deep South during the early 60s is painfully obvious.I would guess that if the film was remade today one of the leads would go to a black actor of the quality of Morgan Freeman (replacing Hackman's character) or Denzel Washington (replacing Defoe's preachy, peace-loving act). At least this would've added far more balance & realism to the film without making it too overtly politically correct. Afterall why should cynical black townsfolk ever want to co-operate with white FBI agents. In their eyes all whites are just the same and to be mistrusted in equal measure.This film could have been better perhaps from an American director rather than from an 'outsider' looking in. Parker is very much like Ridley Scott at times: all style over content without really understanding what it is he is trying to portray, which is a great shame.If one can forgive these flaws Mississippi Burning is a very good drama. Special mention has to go to the ever-dependable Gene Hackman who returns to form as the no-nonsense former sherrif who knows how the locals tick and isn't about to be fobbed off in the same way as the rather naive & clean-cut Defoe.Overall then, Mississippi Burning, fails to get its message across but entertains us nonetheless. The acting is good, the screenplay stilted and the characterizations are pigeon-holed. But for all that this film is worth a look because even though it is very uneven the main theme of apartheid, oppression & racism between black & white Americans is a good lesson for us all to think about and realise that over the last 30 years nothing much has changed.***/*****",8,2,3,18 August 2002
Au Revoir les Enfants," Children hide a terrible secret in this film masterpiece
","On seeing this movie several years ago my accompanying colleagues said of the film: what a load of self-indulgent, confusing, French stylized rubbish. They bemoaned the slow pace of the film, of the 2 dimensional directing and lack of any action or violent death scenes!Those words still linger with me now and has made me realise that perhaps a lot of the movie-going public these days feed on the latest sfx pyrotechnics, more ingenious ways of abstract killings, lots of needless sex and not letting a good intelligent story get in the way.Films like Les Enfants are going to be even more difficult to track down if Hollywood and some of the European studios opt for the fast Buck route to riches.Les Enfant is a truly wonderful & yet harrowing account of life in a Catholic boys boarding school during the dying embers of the Nazi occupation of France in WW2. One of the new boys happens to be Jewish but the headmaster chooses to keep such identities covert while still offering him sanctuary and an education in spite of all the risks he takes.To be fair I know little of Louis Malle previous to this film, but I think he must have poured his life's soul into writing & directing Les Enfant.No detail, harrowing or otherwise, is spared; we see so much beauty amongst the horrors of occupation & collaboration; but also the blossoming relationship between the two lead boys and how initial envy & hatred of the Jew is somewhat diluted by the realities that this is no infantile school game but that life and death for the Jewish boy hangs by a thread if anyone at the school should reveal his true identity.The final moments are perhaps one of the most sad & dramatic scenes I have ever seen. These days a lot of people would be waiting for some great heroic entrance from a big movie star to sort out all the misery and leave us with a reassurance that 'it really wasn't all that bad back then was it'.But there are no heroes at the end of this movie, at least not the kind of heroes Hollywood serves up. The boys in this film are the true heroes right to the very end, primarily for their spirit of humanity in the face of impossible odds.This is the hard reality of war amongst children growing up not only in the face of their own adolescence (and all the problems that serves), but also with the dark fingered claw of Nazism hanging menacingly like the the Scythe of the Grim Reaper.This film will move you in so many directions and will hopefully bring you back down to earth from the current Hollywood shallow circus of pap & style-over-content.Its a difficult film to track down, and the reason for this can be attributed to the first paragraph of this review.*****/*****",10,32,40,9 July 2000
12 Angry Men," Guilt & Justice - A Lesson to us all
","A very good film that seems more suited to the stage. The story is simple yet concise and thought-provoking. A teenager with a history of crime behind him is charged with murdering his own father. Most of the jury, the dis-interested judge and several witnesses are all of the same mind - guilty!!Its left to one man, Number 8, (Henry Fonda) to use his liberal sense of justice & circumstance in defending the boy against impossible odds - especially when faced with one of the biggest cynics of the jury, Lee J Cobb(his best performance by far)Lumet directs with great aplomb, the routine story is given extra life by the wonderful characters who really give a tour-de-force performance, and perhaps makes us feel guilty when we decide individuals in modern society are instantly guilty based purely on their ethnicity, social standing and other inner prejudicesBut what I admired most was the camerawork. 90% of the film takes places in the juryroom where the 12 men (no women, no blacks - this was 1957!) deliberate. With a clever combination of lighting & tight camera angles you feel as if you can smell the clamminess & claustrophic atmosphere of that intense little room.A weak point could be directed at Fonda for playing the whiter-than-white liberal rising above the savage right-wingers, and to be frank I didn't rate his performance much above mediocre - for me, his best role apart from On golden Pond would be Once Upon A Time in The West!The true acting honours really go to Cobb and especially, Ed Begley, playing the racist redneck to a tee.

The Fifth Element," Another white vest day for Willis!
","I've always been a great fan of Luc Besson. With his chic Gallic ideas you can be sure that the presentational style of any his films is always going to be interesting.Leon is my favourite Besson film because it handles a difficult subject with a steady & intelligent hand, while still offering plenty of explosions & gun fights to keep the action fans content.The 5th Element, however, is more of mixed bag and I do feel he went a little too far with the ingredients - adding far too much visual candy and not enough dialogue & logic. The final outcome is a rather a mismatch of stylish ideas based on a thin storyline foundation.For Willis, as our 23rd century cab driver turned galactic hero, its just another Die Hard vehicle. As soon as he dons his white vest you just know he's going to be involved in a load of death defying stunts. So there are no radical acting departures for Willis which is a poor start because once we realize this fact everything else becomes a tad predictable.Milla Jovovich, as the alien visitor Leeloo, does a good job of a rather dysfunctional character. She doesn't have to do very much apart from mumble some alien speech and come over all cutesy and doey eyed when required.
Ian Holm is grossly miscast as the all-knowing priest. You can sometimes see from his body language & facial expressions how uncomfortable he feels with the dialogue & acting he is given. He tries hard to convince but I think he inwardly knows that this film is just plastic pap with a heavy dose of French mustard.  Gary Oldman plays the fascist yet again, hamming it up like there's no tomorrow (which in this particular film is just as well), just like in Besson's earlier film, Leon. Credit where credits due though, he does seem to be enjoying his role more than the others and you're almost guaranteed a good performance from him no matter how poor the script.Chris Tucker, however, really does ruin this film big style. He is totally OTT and screams & shouts like a little brat not getting his Christmas treats. The film is loud & garrish enough with him having to add to it, but he does so anyway and makes a real hash of everything around him.On the whole therefore, the film will be remembered more for its special effects than logical storyline. Besson has gone overboard with the $90 million budget,spending at least 95% of it on the sfx and the other 5% on the story, which is a great great shame.With a more intelligent script and with perhaps James Cameron or Gayle Anne Hurd producing, then I'm sure this film would have been a real blockbuster rather than the hotch potch we have here.

Home Alone," Good Family Film with Tom & Jerry style violence
","A picked-on 8 year old kid (a surprisingly competent performance from Macaulay Culkin before he grew up to be a bigger kid!) is left home-alone by a family taking a Christmas vacation to Paris. Expecting a quiet few days on his own he has to contend with a couple of inept burglars with his own inventive traps & bouts of violence.A very simple film with a sugary & predictable message at the end. But inspite of the thread-bare plot it is a very enjoyable romp, perhaps because of the rather inventive but uncomplicated writing from John Hughes.The film only really comes alive during the battle of wits between Culkin & the two robbers (well supported by Pesci & Stern) while the rest of the film just trundles along at a rather predictable pace.I saw this film back in 91 and found it quite funny (still do in fact). But at that time I hadn't really had much chance to see other Pesci movies of the time.But now, some 10 years on everytime I see Pesci screaming in agony as he suffers more comic violence from the inventive little brat I keep thinking he's going to go into Goodfellas or Casino mode and pull out a gun along with a hail of abusive language and shoot the kid full of bullets, or put his head in a vice.But anyway, Home Alone is a good family movie that doesn't stretch the mind and never really offends anyone although perhaps the Tom & Jerry style violence is perhaps a little too strong in places. Its a nicely packaged movie and I have to admit Culkin is very very good here. Best not mention the two limp sequels.***/*****",6,0,1,2 January 2001
The Terminator," T1 Far Better Than T2
","For me T1 outstrips T2 in many departments, primarily because any sequel that rides off the back of a very successful original will have a bigger budget, more technicians, more scriptwriters, bigger & better sfx etc etc.So it came as no surprise to see that T2 had all these features but at the end of the day it was nothing more than a retread of T1, and as a consequence doesn't fall into the same classic status as its parent.When I first saw T1 back in 1985 I'd hardly heard of Arnie apart from his Conan films. But as the film rolled I immediately began to warm to him as the cold calculating cyborg on a mission to kill his nemesis (sarah Connor) from the past who's future son will change the outcome of a war between humans & cyborgs, something that Arnie, as a T800 cyborg has been returned to the past to prevent.As one would except from a Cameron/Hurd film the action comes thick and fast, but the story & the characterisation isn't forgotten in all the mayhem.The lead protaganists, Connor (Hamilton), Reese (Biehn) and of course Arnie, do a very good job with their characters. Ok, so Arnie doesn't get round to saying too much, probably because of his Austrian accent being a little too thick for American audiences to take on board. However, his accent is perfect for the T800,adapting to the world of 1984.There are many great moments in the film and of course there are one two classic quotes that will go down in cinema history, such as 'I'll Be Back!!' and 'F**k You, ***hole!'. you just have to watch the movie to understand how those quotes fit perfectly into the story!It was interesting that Arnie very much wanting to play the badguy in T800. Perhaps he felt at the time that this would be his big chance to get into the Hollywood limelight - and boy did it pay off in spades.T1 is good on video but is even better on DVD. You can still see the small budget in this film and there are a lot of sfx that look quite basic, as well as positively visible. However, that was all to change when T2 came along and a new generation of cgi & morphing made audiences' jaws drop in amazement.But for the gee-whizz sfx of T2 I would recommend T1 first and foremost. Its a great film and has a cult following too. We will have to see what T3 has to offer next year, but T1 will still be way ahead of the crowd.****/*****",9,0,0,4 July 2001
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Sellers & Kubrick hit top form.
","A perfect period movie that perhaps to a 21st century public feels somewhat remote & dated. But back in the early 60s people had a genuine right to worry about the bomb, since this was the era of Vietnam, Cuba, Kennedy assassinations and a rapid build up of nuclear weapons.However, rather than play a straight bat with loads of doom & gloom, moralising & hardnosed anti-war messages etc, Kubrick goes off at a tangent and plays for comedy - black comedy in fact.And what we are rewarded with is a superb anti anti-war film. The messages are still there but they're not shoved in our faces. Instead they are subtly written into the humour which makes the film even more accessable because you then realise that even the people supposedly on 'our side' do not always have our best interests at heart.Sellers is of course a total revelation - better than the Pink Panther roles, this time he as three characters to stretch his considerable chameleon talent and not one of them is weak.But it's not entirely his film, he is ably supported by George C Scott and Sterlin Hayden  - two American Generals who both seem to have their own agenda. The latter is the one who actually starts the attack on Russia because he is worried about his 'bodily fluids!'. While Scott is just as mad because he actually condones the other's actions, which says a lot about the mentality of the armed forces!Slim Pickins, also deserves a mention as the pilot sent out to bomb 'those Rooskies!' I especially loved the scene with him riding a nuke, which just adds to the dark humour.This film is also quite superior to the other anti-war movie that came out at about the same time - FailSafe with Henry Fonda as the Prez. This film does play a straight bat - there is little or no humour, just serious expressions and lots of doom mongering. A very absorbing film, but perhaps not what the audiences of the time wanted in light of the all the real threats of war that hung over their heads.Instead, they chose Dr Strangelove, the same message but coated in humour which at least gave some light relief for a couple of hours!Sellers' best film by far. Kubrick's second best after 2001

Alien," Fast Food Shocker In Outer Space!
","Alien follows all the usual shocks & horrors from your typical spooky haunted house movie. Lots of dark rooms, creepy dark corners and paranoid & scared-witless humans all dancing a merry tune trying to stay alive from the hungry monster that lurks just out of sight.Alien turned the cosy, sterile world of sci-fi on its head when it first hit the screens back in 79. Until then most of the popular movie-going public had either viewed the sheer escapism and good guy Vs bad guy scenarios  of Star Wars or the intellectualism of Close Encounters. But Alien was really the first haunted house movie in space where lots of people could hear you scream!Although the film isn't really all that intellectually challenging and the script is very much lightweight, the film does benefit from a great collaboration of component parts.First there is Don O'Bannon's wonderfully inventive screenplay coupled with a superbly scored movie sound track by the ever-dependable Jerry Goldsmith, that really sets the mood & tempo for the film right from the eerie opening.Then of course some of the lead character/actors must get a mention since they were largely unknowns both here and in the States. Sigourney Weaver in particular, is outstanding and carries the film very well, and which later improved even further with Aliens.But special mention must also go to the support, including a bold performances from Ian Holm, John Hurt and Yephet Kotto.Then of course there is a the set design and the construction of the Alien itself - truly the stuff of nightmares and a very inventive mind thanks to people like H. R Giger, Nick Allder and Terry Rawings.It made a pleasant change to see a space ship so untidy, messy and dirty compared to what our usual expectations of a futurist space ship should look like (ie, all bright lights, sterile white walls and not a coffee cup or half-eaten doughnut in sight).Admittedly the opening scene of the Nostromo panning overhead to emphasise its huge bulk is a definite steal from the classic opening from Star Wars, but from there any further similarities end.Then of course to complete a good film one does need a good director, and this is where 20th Century Fox took a big gamble in the relatively unknown Ridley Scott. Before this big break Scott was a director for tv commercials in the UK, and to be honest some of that 30second trickery of getting a message across is visible in Alien at times too.However, Scott is also a man of vision. Anyone who went on to see BladeRunner will testify to that. Although it can also be said that the handling of a good story in both these films left something to be desired. Scott is very much a style over content director especially when it comes to either SF (BladeRunner, Alien) or great epics such as 1492.But for all that he does a very good job scaring the wits out us with Alien coupled with some very fancy photography & characterization. He builds the tension very slowly. He knows what the audience are thinking in what is about to happen, so he hoodwinks them with false shocks and other distractions that let us off the hook when we expect the worst to happen.But then when he does choose to shock us he does so on his own terms and when we expect it least. Of course the chest-busting (or alien birth) not only shocked us but also most of the other actors in the film as well, because Scott simply loves playing jokes on us.The only disappointment is the real shallowness of the characters. We don't get to know them all that well before they end up being picked off by the Alien. Its only Ripley that really stands out and her character becomes far more fleshed out in the excellent Aliens.Although I must say I was rather disappointed at the way she was exploited at the end of the film: was there really any need to have the camera see her undress and stare at her panties close up for more than what was really needed to be tasteful?Ian Holm plays his 'unusual' character just right, with a good combination of calculating charm & menace. But Harry Dean Stanton is wasted in this movie. To my mind he is more a character actor who only really shines with a good script and much more rounded character, such as his superb role in Paris Texas. But in this movie he is just Alien Fodder with a dopey fixation of searching for the Ship's Cat all alone with the hungry little Alien is in hiding waiting for its first meal.In fact the cat proved to be the linchpin throughout the film, especially near the end when for whatever reason Ripey goes in search of it with the clock ticking and the Alien chasing her for a bit more fast food.A lot of people feel Aliens is the better movie, but I don't agree. Alien succeeded on a relatively small budget and an old concept of shock/horror movie making but set in space and which proved to be a huge box office success.Aliens was therefore made on the back of this success, but all that was needed to make it even more better was a bigger budget, better special effects and a deeper more fleshed-out story line and characterisation. Which Aliens did in spades.But for all that is big & flashy in Aliens I still feel Alien is superior, perhaps not in story-content or sfx, but certainly in atmosphere, originality and concept design.****/*****",9,1,3,24 August 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," A Total Delight
","I haven't read the books; and neither am I a big fan of rom-coms and other 'girly-flics'. So I approached this movie with some supreme caution, reluctance and even dread.However, some 90 odd minutes later, I have to say what a joy it was!Lonely Girl (Bridget): identity crisis, getting old before her time, a dreamer, but scared of getting left behind as a cranky old spinster.Total Cad of the Highest Order (Cleaver, Bridget's boss): womaniser, lier, betrayer of naive women's hearts; handsome, a weaver of words and irresistible to Bridget.Boorish Barrister (Darcy): lives in a suffocating world of vacuous, society, people, boring jobs, boring lives; and shackled to the most hideous wife-to-be imaginable. All three are inextricably linked, yet who will Bridget ultimately find true love with? Yes, this kind of story has been done to death, Yes, it had a very predictable storyline, Yes, it was dreadfully clichéd, Yes, it stretches realism hugely, Yes, it yet again gave a rather stilted & blinkered view of jolly old upper-middle class England, Yes, it had a very telegraphed ending.But you know what? I couldn't care a jot!For it was pure, simple entertainment: I cared not about any of the above; I cared not how the film didn't live up to the expectations of the book; and I really cared not whether a 'plump' Bridget Jones could really hit it off with a two very handsome men!Just take the film at face value and leave the cynicism on the doorstep.My wife loved it, and I was very entertained by it, especially with its light humour & slapstick; and of course the rather feel-good ending.For a person who prefers far more weightier genres & more thought-provoking scripts, I didn't think I would ever enjoy a rom-com. But on this occasion, I am happy to admit I was totally wrong! Bridget Jones, is a total delight.****/*****",9,2,3,4 May 2009
The Godfather: Part II," A masterpiece of intelligent movie-making
","You have to hand it to Coppola; he is without doubt one of the finest directors/screenwriters of the 20 the Century. we know about his Godfather contributions, but when you also consider Patton, The Conversation, Apocalypse Now & RumpleFish, we have to appreciate what a superb writer he really is.But The Godfather films will be his most-remembered for all the right reasons, and deservedly so, especially working in collaboration with Mario Puzo, one of best authors of the time.Coppola is never a man who tries to cut us short with a dumbed-down version of any classic novel, especially Puzo's that have a breadth & majestic intensity all of their own. Coppola insists on giving us literally every element from book to film - boring, irrelevant bits as well. And yet those very same 'boring bits' work so well in the hands of the Master that it gives the movie (any of his movies in fact) a more intelligent & rounded gloss.I must admit to preferring G2 to the original because it offered so much richness & character-defining elements than the first. Although Brando was very good & suitably threatening in the first, he would also bring the pace of the film down to a stroll bringing the other characters down with him.However, with the 'unknown' De Niro playing the young Vito in G2 we get to see a revolution in his character development, in fact all the main characters including Pacino's, Keaton's & Duvell's are given greater scope to expand on their originals.Special mention must go to Robert Duvell, probably one of the most outrageously under-rated stars of our time, who possesses more talent in one those 'Mona Lisa' like smirks than a lot of so-called big A1 stars of today!I truly loved G2, more so in the cinema than on video because an epic 'Italian opera' such as this deserves room to breath and a 29' TV screen just doesn't cut it.G2 is better than the first, although it is just as dependent on it in order to build on the original's foundation. G2 is more intelligent to look at, the script sparkles, the violence is choreographed & not overdone; the acting is memorable and Coppola' talented hand at the tiller is there for all to see & aspire too.*****/*****",9,0,0,9 July 2000
Léon: The Professional," The Director's Cut is even better than the classy original!
","The original Leon was truly excellent - typical of most Besson films, full of style, drama, dry wit & European subtlties.The main story is quite ordinary really. Three principle characters - Leon (Reno) is the cleaner, or hitman. Very good, very professional, very deadly. And yet he has become more and more detached from the real world - all he knows is a world of killing, exercise and shady deals.Matilda (Portman) lives with her brutish stepfather and his family. She has no true family except for her 4 year old brother. Other than that she goes through her daily 12 year old existence by being bullied & slapped around.Stansfield (Oldman), a police detective who now believes the grass is very much greener on the other side, and has become a drug dealer while still holding down his cop side.One day Matilda returns from a shopping trip to find her horrid step family gunned down my Oldman and his crew. She's shocked but remains indifferent to the killings, until she finds out they've also shot her true brother.She has no where to go and Stansfield still hasn't finished with his killing spree realising from a family photo that only Matilda remains alive.All this is watched through the spyhole of Leon's front door. He too is startled but like Matilda remains indifferent.She walks down the corridor and rings his doorbell, anguish desperately written all over her face for him to let her in. The question is, will he?And this is where the story really gets interesting. Yes we can see its going to be a movie about revenge & justice, but the two characters are like Romeo & Juliet, star crossed lovers, although very much in a missing father-daughter sense.The story moves on at a steady pace, Matilda & Leon teaching each other their respective skills. He shows her how to kill with a rifle; she shows him how to read & write.The ending is quite explosive, literally, but also very sad & moving. Just when you think the two have truly found each other it goes horribly wrong.The original film is, as I say, very good, but is also naggingly incomplete. There are too many loose ends in the mid section and we're never really sure how the relationship between Leon & Matilda develops so quickly.However, its only now, some 6 years on do we find the answer to our mystery. Besson has released a Director's Cut, which adds about 30 minutes of character development missing from the middle of the first. Only trouble is, the DC version is only currently available in France & Japan.But such was my desire I went over to Paris and saw it at a full moviehouse. And what a difference. The mid section offers true evidence of Matilda's revenge tutored by the fatherly Leon, but there's also a slightly darker area, which may explain why it wasn't kept in the original version.Even in the original there are subtle hints of something more than just a father/daughter relationship going on between the two, but this is investigated much further in the DC when you have this worrying thought as to how far Besson is willing to push Portman.Happily nothing comes of it, but the extra minutes do add a few more answers to an otherwise excellent movie. Reno is, as always a joy to watch, and seems to have reprised his role from the earlier Besson Movie Le Femme Nikita.Oldman is perhaps a slight weak link, playing his role far too over the top to be taken seriously, which is a great shame, because he was quite excellent in Besson's later film, The 5th Element.But the true honours have to go to Portman, her first leading role for a girl of only 12, I'm still amazed how she wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Even more so with how she hasn't really been allowed to develope her considerable talent in latter films, including Star Wars 1, and Heat.If you want an example of her divine acting talent look for the scene near the start. Ringing Leon's doorbell and the tearful expression on her face as she silently begs to be let in while a hitman looks on!I sincerely hope Leon DC becomes more widely available. For me its Besson's best film and well worth owning.*****/*****",8,0,1,24 June 2000
The Thing," The Thing not as good as Alien
","Early Carpenter movies seem to find a particular niche and exploit them to their very best. I'm thinking of Assault on Precinct 13 (drama); The Fog (Ghost/thriller); Halloween (slasher/terror); Escape from New York (Sci Fi/thriller) and of course The Thing (Pure Horror);although ever since then he seems to have lost his magical touch. For a start, the original Thing from the 50s is a better movie because it relies on tension rather than out & out gore. In addition The Thing has been compared to Alien, but again the latter film has the edge because the gore is limited to our imagination while focusing on what's-around-the-corner scenario.Having said that, the story & characterisation are both very good. Russell seems to be enjoying himself as the anti-hero, more so than he did in the Escape films.Rob Bottin's special effects are truly amazing pre-CGI, and all the better for it. Although on the down side, I felt Ennio Morricone was the wrong choice to write the score - far too understated & amateurish. Morricone works better with orchestral scores and not messing around on synthesizers and samplers.The ending too was poor. Too many loose ends and disappearing characters. Bit of an anti-climax for a Carpenter film  then, but is still recommended especially in DVD with widescreen pro-logic.***/*****",7,0,2,28 June 2000
The Shining," The Shining is not quite so bright after all!
","Not one of Kubrick's better films by a long piece of chalk but that doesn't mean it's over-hyped rubbish either. But in relation to some of his other films Kubrick falters quite badly when he tries his hand at the horror/suspense genre.I've read King's novel and to some extent it is far better than the movie. But why King and his die-hard followers keep on banging on about how 'totally different' the movie is to the book should realize that Kubrick ADAPTED the book into a working screenplay. Perhaps people should look the word up in the dictionary before firing off loose cannon.What we are left with is a decent psychological/haunted house kind of affair. Jack Nicholson is a good choice as Jack Torrance who is contracted to look after the empty Overlook hotel throughout the winter season with his weak minded wife and gifted young son.But this isn't his best role in spite of his rather deranged & some would say 'hammy' performance. He certainly convinces us that he is losing his marbles with that trademark grin of his but it all happens a little too early in the story. In addition the film either focuses on his gradual dementia or the spooky goings on within the hotel itself. Very little development time is given to the supporting characters.Little Danny has psychic powers but the story never exploits this rather amazing '6th sense'. Instead we just see Danny riding around the floors on his bike looking suitably scared & witnessing ghostly apparitions while wagging his finger at everyone.Shelly Duvell fails quite unilaterally as Jack's wimpy wife. No wonder Kubrick made her shoot one particular scene over 120 times. Her physical demeanour, body language and facial expressions just don't add up to the kind of character Kubrick had in mind. Duvell totally misreads what is asked and is utterly consumed by the overpowering presence of Nicholson's Torrance which makes the film unbalanced and a trifle goofy.In addition, Scatman Crothers, just like Danny, shuffles in & out of the film either looking spooked or concerned for the young boy since they both have the same psychic talent, which again isn't explored in the film. And his cheap demise is really nothing more than a metaphor for Kubrick not knowing how to properly develop the character, so instead he just kills him for no coherent reason.But Kubrick does a good job with the scenery and the interior sets, which certainly offers a lot of depth to the ghostly story but all this is rather secondary to what is going in Jack's mind, which is never fully underwritten. Instead Kubrick has to rely on physical set pieces to emphasize Torrance's mental state by using either the maze, room 237, the axe through the door etc.It is truly a scary movie first time round. But after repeated viewings you feel you want to look deeper into the characters. But you find there is very little there to wonder how these people got together in the first place since they're all so individualistic & one dimensional with their own little character traits which are never explored.The Shining doesn't shine that brightly in my opinion. The book is better sure, but it's not really worth comparing the two because that would miss the point. The movie is good, if slightly hyped because its basically a Kubrick/Nicholson star vehicle. I would recommend it because there is plenty to see and think about. It's just a shame the Kubrick didn't spend a little more time fleshing out the supporting characters rather than concentrating on Nicholson's diminishing view of the world about him.***/*****",8,0,0,9 August 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One Of The Better Sequels
","T2 is a fab movie, especially with its 2nd generation cgi and the introduction of Morphing. Coupled with a good, but slightly convoluted script, and passable acting, T2 deserved to be a box office smash.It was also good to see Arnie return but this time as the good cyborg as opposed to the baddie in T1. Robert Patrick was also very good as the T1000 but again, the sfx took most of his character away so he didn't do very much other than do a lot of killing, staring & running.I also felt Linda Hamilton just didn't 'look' right as her powerful role, Sarah Connor compared to her original performance in T1. In T2 she looks thin, pale, drawn and doesn't seem to have the same drive or mommentum that she did in T1, even though we have to accept a certain amount of deterioration owing to her incarceration in a mental institution.Ed Furlong, is also quite flat in the acting dept as the young John Connor. He didn't convince for a second and made the film feel uneven: there are better child actors available but I'm afraid Ed just didn't cut the mustard here.It's a shame the Mike Biehn didn't reprise his role because he would've added more interpersonal characterisation between Sarah & himself. But as it is the film lacks a certain 'warmth' that leaves the audience isolated and not fully caring for any of the lead characters.It cannot be denied that T2 is a great film but only in the context of sfx and extending the scope of the sci-fi genre. Otherwise the film looks a pale imitation to the original & superior Terminator.**/*****",7,6,9,4 July 2001
Apocalypse Now," He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct.
","One of Kubrick's best and certainly the most gut-wrenching & cerebral films. This isn't your typical warfilm of 'them and us' and it would be a mistake to think of this film in the same context as Platoon or SPR.This is a far more implicit, personal tale of a Captain's insular view of a world finally gone mad - there are so many one-liners throughout the film that signpost to good effect the blatant contradictions of America's true purpose in this war - Kurtz is a top Colonel of the old school; a tactical genius who finally flips when his own side declares that he murdered rather than 'killed' spies even though all the evidence pointed in his favour.Other contradictions include the summary above - of a man who has gone beyond acceptable human conduct. And yet you get US aircraft dumping napalm on remote villages maiming women & children.Sheen's Captain Willard's mind is full of these contradictions to the extent that he is gradually losing focus on what his true purpose is out there. His only solace is drugs & booze while praying/dreading the next mission: a mission into the heart of darkness.The entire film is really nothing more than what is going on in Willard's deug induced chaotic mind - there are so many unbalanced things going on: kids surfing, tanning and listening to Jimi Hendrix, Bunny Girls appearing & disappearing out of the Heavens; a photo journalist high on drugs but full on poetic enlightenment!Wherever he looks he sees conspiracy to cover up other people's concepts of indiscretion. Later he meets Lieutenant Kilgore (apt surname) supremely played by Duvell, who seems to consider finding the best time & place to surf more important than carrying out his mission. But even after one particular battle he comes reflective that very soon the war is going to end even though he 'loves the smell of napalm in the morning'. There is no happiness in his voice at the thought of the war ending, far from it, he wants it to last forever because that gives him (and perhaps many other one-dimensional officers) a purpose, a political (not moral) reason; an excuse to carry out their actions with impunity; and yet at the same time Willard has to hunt down & kill a decent General on a trumped up charge, because 'he has gone beyond the pale'!It goes on & on, the bulls__t never ends; and this is Coppola's message. American 4 star generals blame their own mistakes on others and want those mistakes 'terminated with extreme prejudice'. Kurtz proved to a  thorn in their side and want him 'terminated' but for not obeying orders to kill only those they want him to kill.If you've seen the documentary you will be aware of how much time, effort & money (and health!) it took to get the printed word onto film and in my judgement it is perhaps the best movie indictment of America's protracted stay in Vietnam, and more specifically, Cambodia. (a film even Oliver Stone would be proud of)The acting, with the exception of Brando, is truly breathtaking, especially from Sheen as a man high on booze & drugs and who can flip is normally cool manner with acts of sudden violence & aggression (the machine gun attack on the boat)Brando, I feel, ruined the movie; more so when you read about his exploits off it. He really didn't give a s**t about the book or Coppola's vision, so the committment & acting you do finally see from him is really just bogus. The ending seemed like an afterthought and wasn't very well executed after such a long & dramatic beginning.You have to see this film time & time again because it is an insane vision seen from an insane mind during and insane war where drugs or bullets are the only true means of escape.If you want simplicity go see Platoon; if you want a guilty conscience on behalf of your own past Governments rent this and wonder how this could ever have been allowed to happen!

The Patriot," History in the (re)making
","It would be interesting how US reaction would be if the Chinese film industry produced a film concerning the Vietnam war back in the late 60s.But to add some 'drama' they showed typical GIs viciously slaughtering women & children, torturing them,raping them etc. With the film in the can and winning hearty approval to a Chinese audience it was then given to a US distributer.Question 1. Will the distributer have the nerve to show it?
Question 2. Will the US audience regard it in the same manner & grace as the Patriot (which is, after all only a dramatised Movie according to Gibson, but he would say that wouldn't he)?Question 3. Will there be outrage by the US Gov. and public alike against those 'dirty Commies' and their blatant rewriting of scenes that probably never happened?I saw The Patriot, and it is by and large a good film of America's fight for Independance. But what marred it was the zealous direction with regards black slaves & of course the Brits. Every successful nation has its skeletons in cupboards, and Britain certainly has its fair share, but I'm pretty sure the scenes depicted so generally in this movie never happened in real life.Having read many historical books on the British Empire & American Independence over the last few years the conflict was fought in a civil manner with American tactical supremacy & individual courage winning the War from a rather overstretched Brit Army and a tactically weak HQ. But no where did I come across any transcripts from US soldiers or civillians with regards brutal British tactics or happy slaves!An average film that could have been truly great had it not had to resort to xenophobia & over dramatising.**/*****",Null,0,1,15 July 2000
Cross of Iron," A superior war film - A Children's Crusade - one of Peckinpahs' best
","Think of Sam Peckinpah and you instantly think of the final bloody shoot out from The Wild Bunch, the controversial rape scene from Straw Dogs, or the other shoot out in Pat Garrett. All of them memorable movies that won deserved critical acclaim.Cross of Iron is a film that has been continually overlooked in this context which is a great shame because for me its probably his second best film after WB.Definitely an anti-war film taken from the ordinary German soldier's perspective. Not quite in the same league as All Quiet on the Western Front, but very emotionally involving for all that.James Coburn plays cynical Sgt Steiner a man who has seen enough killing and is sick of it, even though he won the Iron Cross,he regards it as nothing more than a piece of useless metal.Contrast this to Maximilian Schell's Captain Stransky, Steiner's commander. A self-confessed aristocrat with an image to maintain; a man who has seen very little frontline action and yet if he doesn't receive the very same Iron Cross would mean certain social death for him back home. 
Both men are so socially & ideologically different and yet fight on the same side. A German who only fights because he has to whether he likes it or not, another German who is scared of fighting yet has his social standing to worry about. Nazism isn't even questioned here - there are no stereotypical jack booted Jerries or mad ranting generals; just ordinary men fighting for their own personal ends.As usual we have the typical Peckinpah trademarks of slow mo action sequences of men being tossed in the air like litter as well as the cold blooded inhumanities one man (or woman in this case) can inflict upon another.But in addition, and which is never really made clear in this film, is that this particular conflict isn't just about class and Iron Crosses but also of a Children's Crusade. Peckinpah makes this harrowing point on quite a few occasions: the blonde Russian boy soldier that befriends Steiner for one, the scene at the end of the film where Steiner leads Stransky into battle and is almost killed by yet another boy soldier. But most telling of all is the musical score, initially sung in chorus by children coupled with a final slide-show of young children either being hung or suffering a miserable existence through no fault of their own.A very good anti-war film then: a bit too simplistic perhaps but is excellent all the same. Coburn, Mason & particularly Warner play their parts with passion & openess.****/*****",8,3,4,16 July 2000
Duck You Sucker," Goodbye Horse, hello Motorcar - another revolution!
","Of all Leone's supposed 'spaghetti' westerns it is this that is perhaps the most undervalued & least revered, which is a huge shame, because 'Fistful of Dynamite' is on a par with the Dollar films and almost reaches the stratospheric heights of the WEST & AMERICA movies.It's interesting how his westerns are like chapters in history - consider WEST as being a true cowboy western of the late 1800s, AMERICA covers Chicago gangsters of  the 1920s and 60s; while DYNAMITE acts as a fulcrum between the dying western era of the late 1890s and the birth of a new 20th century revolution of the motor car.And this allegory is visualised quite perfectly by the two main protagonists, Steiger, an old style cowboy cum Mexican bandit unaware that his era is almost over. And then we have Coburn as the 20th Century Man: a new modern breed of terrorist (or bandit if you like) with new-found technologies (liquid dynamite in a bottle) and early materialism (the motorbike replacing the horse).Steiger has no greater desire than to rob banks and take care of his family just like hundreds of bandits before him, but realises very slowly that the world he lives in is in turmoil and change is on the way.The Mexican Revolution is like an American version of WW1 where the new supercedes the old and Steiger finds it more & more difficult to realise his dreams. That is until Coburn rides into view.Steiger is impressed with this Modern Man, seeing him as some kind of Saviour to replenish his thirsty desires. Yet Coburn has seen it all before - the killings, the revolutions, the plottings back in Ireland as a member of the IRA fighting for a cause just like the Mexican Revolution he now finds himself immersed in.After a hesitant start they become firm friends but each has his own reasons why he does what he does. In spite of Steiger's viciousness he really only cares about family values. If the government had treated people such as himself with these values & virtues then he wouldn't have to resort to such extreme measures.By the end of the film and numerous gunfights, betrayals & escapes they both realise that this particular revolution is too big even for them and they decide to go North and head for America.....A classic Leone film typical of the man, although not quite so operatic or vast as the earlier WEST film and even though we are given enough background on both characters we still feel remote from really caring for them, unlike Bronson, Fonda, Robards & Cardineli in WEST.BUT Steiger gives a wonderful performance as the 'little man' fighting for (and against) change, fighting for his family and later, fighting for his people. His faith in God severely tested during one memorable scene in the cave hideout where his family have been massacred through betrayal of a friend.Coburn's performance comes a close second. He is like a middle class intellectual compared to Steiger's working class hero and yet they both seem to depend on each other.Leone has this wonderful talent with character development and how he can pull at our heart strings as our heroes suffer the kind of inhumanities they hand out to others.DYNAMITE lacks the style of WEST & AMERICA, and the flashbacks are a little lumpen & crude. The settings also seem a little less grandiose & beguiling compared to the refined township world of Jill McBaine from WEST.The music from Morricone (who else!?) is a little more eclectic & scatty than his previous works: for the first time he adds some random sound effects & chants which goes against the operatic style of the master. But having said that, there are some excellent & familiar haunting scores interlaced between the avant-garde.A very good movie overall but doesn't quite convince or hang heavy in the mind like WEST. ****/*****",9,4,7,22 July 2000
The Usual Suspects," Nice film but the content is all '...window dressing!'
","A very clever who-done-it,  that had rave reviews and audiences were waving their hands in the air wondering who the real Keyser Soze was, and saying how wonderful the twist at the end of the film was.True, seeing the film first time round you do feel as if you've missed something by the end and only by seeing the film a second, third & forth time do you really begin to pick up the many threads.But in essence its hokum, nothing more than a who-done-it bluff on the audience, or as Dean Keaton, one of the major characters says in the film '...it's window dressing..a pipe dream..'Five crims owe a big debt to the mysterious Soze, that involves hijacking a boat full of $91million of drugs from a rival of Soze's. It all goes horribly wrong and the police want to know what's going on.And thats where we have the cripple, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) offer his point of view of what happened. Trouble is at the end of the film the bluff is played and you begin to wonder if what he said was really true.Perhaps the whole film was a con - as seen through Kint's eyes from start to finish, and that we, as the audience, don't get the chance to take an objective view.Either way, the film's notoriety seems to depend on the ending, while the other 95% of the film goes through the motions. Trouble is we don't know enough about these five gangsters, other than Kint, to really care about them. They remain distant & aloof, angry & cold; bit players in Kint's world.But the cops aren't exactly wholesome either, especially Dave Kujan, the hard nosed dick who bullies Kint into submission during the interrogation, and regards himself as intellectually superior to the cripple, only to have his comeuppance later on (But then if we are seeing the film from Kint's point of view, then of course you'd expect this)The only other interesting character next to Kint is Pete Postlethwaite's Kobayashi. A very cool player, plenty of understatement but a hint of menace in his eyes. Strangely I was more scared of him than any of the gang of five, the least inspiring of which would have to be Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton.Byrne tries to look/play the tough leader of the group, and resorts to method acting by grimmacing a couple of times and staring at people with about as much conviction as Roger Rabbitt, not helped by a rather weird Irish/Brooklyn accent, which just doesn't cut the mustard.So yes, its a good film that offers the audience plenty of meat but on reflection it doesn't rank anywhere near the Big Sleep, Sleuth, any Hitchcock film or Agatha Christie caper.Who is Kyser Soze? Who cares!Good, but not that good***/*****",9,1,3,20 June 2000
The Dirty Dozen," A good old fashioned war film with no hidden agenda.
","A generally entertaining war film with no real political axe to grind  or patriotic flagwaving getting in the way.  Its very dangerous trying to humourise war in the movies, because that  would be offensive to all those that had served & died in real life.  Kelly's Heroes and 1941 probably went a little too far, pretending that  war is really fun & cool when you've got people like Clint Eastwood in  charge.  But then you have other war films that are black in its humour but  manage to keep into focus the cruelty & horrors of war at the same time  - M*A*S*H and Catch 22 are the best examples.  With Dirty Dozen we have something of a go-between; the humour amongst  the characters is light & welcoming but never falls into farce or  bad-taste; and Aldrich quickly pulls us back into the fold with some  tight scripted scenes of drama & mass murder (throwing petrol &  grenades into that German bunker to name but one. I often wonder about  that scene, and whether it was some kind of metaphor for the gas  chambers & concentration camps in Belsen)  But unlike MASH & Catch 22, Aldrich resists the temptation to openly  politicise the effects of war, after all this film was made in '67 near  the height of the Vietnam war/protests. Instead he takes a straight  line course of action and lets us be moved & entertained by the  convicted GIs doing their duty.  Marvin is excellent as the hardnosed but disobediant Major. He plays  the anti-hero far better than Eastwood in Kelly's Heroes. Marvin just  looks the type who'd give the top brass as well the Germans a real hard  time.  But special mention must go to Cassavettes as Viktor Franko, the  trouble-maker's trouble-maker. His character is so refreshing & wild  amongst a relatively mild cast of supporting extras, with the exception  of Savalas. Franko is the Joker of the pack but you soon feel an  attachment for him in spite of his crimes.  Sutherland & Bronson, don't really add much. The former plays a  slightly naive man who hasn't really grown up and Bronson just smirks &  mumbles a lot.  The only other character worthy of a mention is the truly terrifying  Savalas, who is a Christian through & through, yet hates all women as  much as the Germans; and has a most spine chilling laugh! Difficult to  believe this man later became Kojak!  The film is a tad overlong; the first & last 40 minutes hold the  interest but the middle section (the War Games scene), is far too long  and generally detracts.  All the same, DD is a very good movie, especially for those who don't  want to be politically moralised too.  ***/*****",7,27,44,9 July 2000
Zulu," Overlong But Very Absorbing.
","Zulu is perhaps one of Stanley Baker's greatest achievements in his relatively short movie career. So impressed was he with the real battle of Rorke's Drift between the indigenous Zulu warriors and the British Army during the reign of Queen Victoria, that he financed the entire movie project more or less on his own.Baker not only produced but also starred alongside the young, fresh-faced Michael Caine. Baker plays Lt John Chard, Officer Of Engineers who marginally out ranks the rather pompous & arrogant Lt Gonville Bromhead (Caine).Chard is very much a military man brought up through the ranks and therefore has plenty of military experience & tactical knowledge. However, his young rival, Bromhead is very much a blueblood, with a family tree full of colonels, captains & generals and therefore he assumes that he too will follow in their footsteps based purely on his standing & lineage.The first 50 minutes of this film centres on this rivalry and as the film unravels further and the various battle sieges are played out under the command of Baker, we get to see Caine's gradual fall from grace as he comes to terms with the fact that he has no head for tactics or military command during battle conditions. And by the end of the film he more or less confesses that the battle of Rorke's Drift is in fact his first.The battle scenes (and there are very many of them) are very well choreographed although the end result is less than satisfying. There are many shots of men being 'stabbed' with spears under armpits or falling over covering bullet wounds even though there is no telltale holes visible on their tunics.I also felt the presence of Jack Hawkins as a pacifist missionary pleading with Baker & Caine to hand over their sick & wounded before the attacks begin, was irritating. I don't doubt that there were missionaries during the real battle but somehow Hawkins didn't convince me at all, especially when it turns out they he is also an alcoholic and general trouble-maker (when the film was first premiered, Hawkins hated the final depiction of his character and didn't attend its opening).The music is also exceptionally good, very much in keeping with the soul & vast presence of the Zulu army and their warrior-like chanting throughout the mountains encircling the small British Army at Rorke's Drift.The film does seem to go on forever. There is a problem with the pacing from Cy Enfields assured direction. He develops the lead characters very well and the battle scenes are generally well done, but he also spends too much time identifying the support characters, which of course is always important but in this case he covers too much ground with too much talk and not enough action. And as a consequence the film out stays its welcome by about 20 minutes.But for all that Zulu is a very good, film, totally absorbing at times, and both Caine & Baker do exceptionally well with their characters. Although to be honest Caine's rather snooty upper-class accent felt so awkward & grating because most of know that Caine has a trademark Cockney accent in most of his films.

Saving Private Ryan," Dull, dull and dull again
","Take the hype, Tom Hanks and the first 20 minutes of this film away and you have a very routine war film with all the usual cliches, gung-ho American GI superhero gunk, all-looks-lost ending and loads of flag waving!In fact even with Hanks the film stinks. There are far better war movies around, the underrated Thin Red Line, Cross of Iron, the full subtitled version of Das Boot (The Boat) and perhaps best of all, Sam Fuller's The Big Red One.But of course they didn't get the kind of success they so richly deserved because there was no Spielberg/Hanks collaboration to get the hypemobile moving.With the exception of the truly outstanding 20 minutes, where no other film (apart from truelife documentaries) has ever come close to the realities of war, SPR sucks through a long thin straw!It sometimes amazes me how Speilberg can hit all the right notes (Jaws, Close Encounters, Schindler's List) with lots of decent action & rounded believable characters we feel for; and then comes out with dross like SPR & Lost World.For those that live outside the States this film will probably leave you cold - especially if you're one of those allied countries that also served in France during WW2, but didn't even get a sniff in SPR.The only decent acting came from Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Horvath. But even he isn't allowed to develop his character before his off on another mission shooting at people and banging on that War is Hell etc.If you want heroes, if you want emotion, if you want drama, if you want a true depiction of how bad WW2 really was go and buy Schindler's List!*/*****",7,0,0,1 July 2000
The Game," Great 1st Half, Awful 2nd
","A nice premise but soon fizzled out to become yet another lame thriller and a quite dreadful final act.Douglas is fairly decent here, simply by recalling his Gordon Gekko (Wall Street) character, along with a splash of his D-Fens (Falling Down) character, and just a pinch of Stephen Hardin (Star Chamber).But the big problem is the uneven plot, which starts out with great promise seeing an arrogant and extremely rich businessman fall on hard times thanks to the mechanics of The Game. He is completely aware of what is going on, but he doesn't appreciate just how far and how dangerous it will play with him. Just like being in a nightmare that you cannot wake yourself out of.But the plot become rather hackneyed come the second half, primarily because its just another cat & mouse thriller that has been done to death elsewhere. The cleverness of the first half is somewhat undone come the 'join the dots' amateur-hour of the second.And the least said about the final 10 minutes the better because that really did insult the intelligence of the average viewer with its cop-out ending. For example, after shooting his brother on the rooftop he decides to commit suicide by jumping off the edge. But it was just purely coincidental that he should fall in exactly the right place to fall through the glass roof and straight onto a waiting air cushion, suffering only minor cuts. How did the people organsing The Game, know he would attempt the suicide on exactly the right spot on the roof and to fall on the exact spot on the air cushion?Moreover, because it was just a game, nothing had really changed because he would soon return to normal life - rich and arrogant with perhaps a touch of much needed humility at the end of it. But in essence I really couldn't have cared less whether this guy lived or died because of who he was and how he treated people. But blame that on the script!Oh, and Sean Penn is totally wasted here. He is not my favorite actor by far, but he does have considerable talent when fully utilized - but it was left wanting here.And to cap it off, the soundtrack is absolutely appalling - straight out of a 1970s murder mystery TV movie, with what sounds like an incredibly bored pianist randomly pounding on the keys!This Game should have been abandoned at half time!",5,0,2,24 May 2020
Kelly's Heroes," Enjoyable WW2 comedy romp
","A great little comedy war film with no political axe to grind and neither does it focus to much on the explicit details of the war. Instead we have a bunch of American GIs tracking down $16 million of gold bars 10 miles behind enemy lines in occupied France.The leader is of course played by a rather dead-pan Clint Eastwood as Kelly, while his heroes include a wonderful performance by Savalas as Big Joe & Donald Sutherland as the 'oddball' Oddball.
Although the humour isn't slapstick or disrespectful, it is rather dry & amusing. There's plenty of war action to keep the fans happy, but its all rather secondary to the main story.Eastwood, however, looks a tad uncomfortable in the role, as if the comedy isn't quite his scene. He grimaces a lot and holds a tight square jaw, without being too gung ho. But he doesn't show any inspiration in his rather straight forward role and as a consequence slowed the pace of the film right down.To compensate for Clint's uninspired performance the film perks up and balances out with wonderfully spunky performances from Savalas & Sutherland.Although Savalas isn't really given much to do to challenge his acting abilities he seems to fit the role more than Clint does. And in a way I'm glad to see him in a rather more humourous WW2 vehicle such as this so soon after his rather manic & sinister role as a GI POW in the 1967 classic, Dirty Dozen.Sutherland's role is both engaging yet way out of time & place since he takes on the part of a tank commander with an attitude of a late 60s hippie with lots of 'hey mans, positive waves, cool man etc'. Whether director, Sutton, felt this was an inspired idea I'm not sure but it makes the film slightly disjointed & time warped.Having said that, Sutherland does add a nice feel to proceedings which only helps the comedy along at a gentle but steady place.And of course, the film becomes even more surreal with the clever little spaghetti western parodies so familiar with a certain Mr Eastwood.Overall, Kelly's Heroes is an enjoyable romp played with a straight bat and which doesn't really offend anyone. It handles the subject of death & war with a distant yet respectful hand. It's basically the direct opposite of all the serious posturing from the earlier Dirty Dozen.Although 30 years old and looks a little dated, KH is a very good film, in spite of Eastwood's rather myopic acting

Men in Black," An enjoyable Sci-Fi romp that is over all too soon
","It's amazing how simple it is to make a really good comedy without having to try too hard with a busy script.Men In Black is just such a comedy, played very firmly with tongue-in-cheek and not to be taken at all seriously. The story is simple yet  very rich & entertaining (although it also received a lot of bad press from some quarters because it was seen as racist - an allegory for repatriating illegal immigrants from the US!)The two lead stars, Smith & Jones, don't have to stretch themselves too much, acting wise, since they're both on familiar ground, especially from wise-cracking Will Smith who was really only continuing his character mannerisms from where Independence Day left off.I was quite surprised with TLJ, I've never really thought of him as being the comedy-film-type, but he plays his role with a great deal of mellowed drollery, not letting Smith's antics wind him up too much, which is typical of most buddy partnerships in comedy movies (Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours etc)The support from Rip Torn & Vincent D'onofrio was good but patchy, they weren't given enough material from the script to make us really care for them. Similarly with Linda Fioretino, she is a very attractive lady but wasn't really allowed to have enough dialogue to make us appreciate her more. She would have made a good foil/romantic link for Smith, but this was never allowed to even develop, just like the character she portrayed.The CGI sfx, although not particularly overwhelming were generally quite good, and the music really helped pace the film and I loved the upbeat & funky Will Smith music video clip straight after the movie.I enjoyed MIB far more than the over-rated, over-hyped IE4. The only problem was that it only lasts about 90 minutes, which is quite short for a Hollywood movie these days where most stretch to at least two hours.I hope the original cast & main characters are brought together again for the impending sequel. There's plenty of material to go round and perhaps on this occasion more attention can be paid to a more indepth characterisation of both K & J (and hopefully  Linda too), because we hardly get to know anything about these dudes from this movie.***/*****",Null,0,0,9 August 2000
Once Upon a Time in America," 224 minutes of pure pleasure, passion, drama, violence & humanity!
","What a great shame for the film industry to see one of the great directors of our time pass away so prematurely -Leone gave us so much pleasure with his films that only now can we really appreciate his true cinematic style & characterisation skills and realise that not many other directors alive can emulate his good work.But at least he gave us yet another classic before he passed away. Once Upon a Time in America is yet another typical Leone operatic masterpiece. 224 minutes of Italian artistry that has to be marveled at, unlike some distributors who didn't have the patience to sit through 4 hours of art, but instead excised about 120 minutes out of it and then foisted it upon a rather confused audience - is it any wonder it didn't do well at the box office so brutely edited!Critics & perhaps some audiences just don't seem to have the time, the patience, or dare I say it the depth of intelligence to really unravel the mind of a master like Leone. He didn't compromise his craft just for the sake of box office takings, awards & plaudits; he didn't comprise his own view of a complex story like this one just to make it easy on a contemporary audience whose attention span these days is less than 5 minutes before surfing other channels.'America' isn't a film to be seen & understood in one sitting; there is simply too much going on; the flashback are set out to confuse first time round, characters appear old, then young, then old again without any real explanation but thats the way Leone unravels a story of friendship & betrayal over a painful 35 year period.This flashback sequence had its origins from his earlier film, Once Upon a Time in the West (my personal favourite), and now he exploited it to a much greater extent in this film, which only adds to the drama and the weightiness of his story.It takes good actors to make Leone's imaginative mind become physical, so it was superb casting getting De Niro & Woods to play the main pivotal parts. De Niro, as well all know, shines in intelligent movies like this; his character is given so much to do & carries so much responsibility, guilt and hurt that De Niro seems to positively enjoy playing the part.And there's the very under rated James Woods. One of my favourite actors (see Salvador to understand why). If you want an actor to play a character with great intensity then I don't think there's anyone (including De Niro) except Woods who could carry it off successfully.Coupled with some fine supporting acting from Pechi & Weld, along with the usual excellent cinematography & Morricone's usual stunning score, we have a truly crafted & intelligent movie that has to be seen again and again...just like a jigsaw puzzle, each viewing adding to the complete picture.I personally don't rate it as high as 'West' but it comes pretty close. Another interesting trademark to note from both films is the way he uses the camera above a bed looking down through netting at Cardineli (West) and also at De Niro (America). Both of them seemingly at peace. Nice touch!****/******",9,0,1,21 July 2000
This Is Spinal Tap," Can I have one of those amps as well please!?
","Oh this is a wonderful, wonderful film full of inventive humour, clever one-liners, good music and above all biting satire.For those of us who can remember those heady rock years of the late 70s/80s this film will be even more poignant since it covers the fading fortunes of a glam rock band on its last legs touring an uninterested US pop culture. A lot of the gags, therefore, may go right over the heads of todays MTV hiphop dance generation but us oldsters can take a good guess where these guys are firing their lampoons at.One of the infamous lines in the movie is 'there's a very fine line between clever & stupid'. But I also think the film itself is a very fine line between fiction & probable fact. I wonder how many real rock bands have suffered similar ignominy and find watching this film too close to the bone!Another virtue is that the film doesn't have to try hard to get its message across; the actors don't really have to stretch themselves with concise scripts & acting ability - this is, afterall, supposed to be a fly-on-the-wall documentary where adlibbing is encouraged.British TV company, Channel 4, produced a similar tv movie called 'Bad News on Tour' by The Comic Strip,at around the same time, and although it probably never reached the States it too is very very funny and follows the same kind of adlib roadie logic of its bigger brother. The only difference is that the subtle lampooning is never made so obvious, but its a good film to add to this kind of rockumentary collective.The only shocking thing is the length of the film - barely 80 minutes. Blink and its almost over. I suppose the producers & director Reiner didn't originally have high hopes of box office success & cult status so it was a movie made very much on the defensive I guess, which is a real shame. Just when we're beginning to really know these guys the movie is over and we end up like Oliver Twist, desperately asking for more!And yes, those immortal words 'This amp goes up to 11' should be recognised with equal merit alongside 'Frankly, my dear....', 'Play it again, Sam...' and 'May the force....'.
An excellent groupie film for those who like to reflect on those heady days of nostalgia & big flares! ****/*****",8,0,2,15 July 2000
Where Eagles Dare," Great Escapist Entertainment
","Perhaps one of the best war films ever to come out of Hollywood, WED, is typical Boys-Own, escapist adventure, where our heroes (Burton, Eastwood et al) can do no wrong and the action comes thick and fast.But this isn't total mindless violence (see Rambo 2, for that kind of rubbish). WED does have a decent story and nice little plot twists, that although not totally plausible do make the film a bit more thought-provoking than just watching 148 minutes of gun fire, explosions, decapitations and soldiers being thrown off cable cars at great altitude.Even though both Eastwood & Burton hog most of the show (and rightly so), they are ably supporting by two women (Mary Ure & Ingrid Pitt). Both women don't have chunky roles but its significant to see any females play such positive parts in what is mostly a male arena when it comes to war films.Some of the photography is absolutely stunning even though some of the stunts are clearly filmed in the relative safety of a studio, and it shows too!The acting, although not as po-faced, talky & self-righteous as the film's nearest rival, The Guns Of Navarone (see review), is good by most standards. Burton looks perhaps little old for this kind of all-out hero roll, but he manages to pull it off with his fierce determination and calm disposition.As for Eastwood, well it meant a uniformed departure from his poncho, gun holster & cowboy hat from his day with Sergio Leone. He is still playing the same kind of character as The Man With No Name, and is still killing hundreds of bad guys while looking suitably cool & reserved, the only difference is the era - from the Wild West to WW2.But surprisingly the combination of Burton's classical approach to acting & Eastwood's brash new-kid-on-the block 60s adaption works quite well and make for a good partnership as they go about kicking German Butt in their usual inimitable ways.Brian Hutton's direction follows the pace & temperament of Alistair MacLean's sparkly screenplay although I do feel the film is a tad too long and I think about 15 minutes could've been cut without really upsetting the balance of the story.WED doesn't challenge the brain, it is thought-provoking in its own little ways and probably bares little or no resemblance to how life was really like during the real WW2. But for all that WED is great entertainment. It doesn't insult the intelligence but then again it was never meant to. But what we are left with is a very enjoyable romp with a great cast and superb scenary.It doesn't take itself too seriously as Guns Of Navarone does; and neither is it just mindless violence (Rambo 2). This film dares to be different and succeeds in spades.Recommended.***/*****",7,53,83,23 August 2002
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's Best film - he really has an Ear for coolness!
","His first, and I think his best movie to date. Thank God for Keitel backing the movie and the Sundance Festival for showing it to a disbelieving audience. Although it didn't hit the box office too hard either side of the Pond it has become something of icon for its legions of fans who can probably recite at least 10 lines of dialogue and own at least one of those cool RD film posters (me included).Tarantino brought a little glamour and style to the gangster film genre, which critics felt made it alright to go out and shoot people so long as they wore black suits & ties and a pair of Rabans.But for me Tarantino turns that argument on its head and shows us that criminals don't win in the end, but die a bloody death.I also liked his choice of actors, although I wish James Woods had known about the movie because he would have made an excellent Mr Orange, rather than the rather lack lustre Tim Roth.But this is balanced out by a truly riveting performance from Michael Madsen as the sinister & sadistic Mr Orange; and another strong performance from Keitel as usual.But my two favourites would have to be Chris Penn's Nice Guy Eddie and especially Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink - a man so highly strung you'd think he'd shoot his own reflection in a mirror if he didn't no better.
We don't get much feedback from Mr Blue (Ed Bunker) or Mr Brown (a cameo from Quentin himself), other than at the start of the movie in the diner, which is a bit of a shame.
**** SPOILER STARTS ****** A lot has been said about the infamous 'Ear' scene. But what exactly did we 'see'. Nothing, is the answer! That's the magic of Tarantino, he sets up the scene with the torture of the policeman and Mr Blonde produces a cut throat razor. He approaches the cop and takes hold of his head and then the camera moves away and we don't see anything except what our imaginations want us to see.The only debatable point is the fact it's a cop that is being tortured, but the important thing is that there is nothing to see -no blood, no guts, nothing. So what's the big deal!**** SPOILER ENDS *****The only problem I had with the movie was how Mr Orange remained so alert during most of the movie even though he must have lost about 3 or 4 pints of blood judging by the state of the warehouse ramp he was lying on.Nevertheless, Dogs is an excellent film, somewhat superior to his latter films of Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown. And it sometimes makes you wonder how the man is ever going to keep the mommentum going.Anyway, Let's go to work!****/*****",8,1,3,9 July 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Top notch movie that is still ahead of the TV series
","Tarrantino comes to London in the guise of Guy Richie.Lock Stock is a gem of a movie about 4 young rogues, but generally nice guys, who decide to play their hands at the poker table with £100,000 of their savings.Only problem is that even though they are quite streetwise they're clearly out of their depth when playing against Hatchet Harry, the local heavy. As a consequence they end up owing him half a million by next week otherwise its goodbye fingers & toes!The movie is superbly directed & choreographed by Madonna's latest boyfriend, Guy Richie. Clearly influenced by Tarrantino, Richie turns on the style with interesting camera angles, lighting, a cool soundtrack and a very witty script.The characterisation is full & rounded, although does sometimes vear towards the stereotypical, especially with the portrayal of the real bad guys - Hatchet & Co.But the other four guys you really do warm too; they're young, attractive, naive but they work off each other and make the film more believable & interesting.Of course, to British audiences they will have seen this kind of comedy/drama before: the TV series, Minder is a good case in point. And they'll also be in for a treat when they see former soccer player, Vinnie 'Hardman' Jones, play a very good role as Big Chris, a muscleman with brains. I hope he appears in more movies, especially comedies, which would suit his character completely.But Richie also presents a darker, menacing side to the move. The violence is very much 'in ya face' without actually seeing what's going on - a bit like the infamous 'ear' scene in Reservoir Dogs.I suppose American viewers will find it difficult at first to understand the accent - well don't feel too left out, most of Britain isn't too well up on some of the Cockney Rhyming slang either. Although some would say it makes a nice change since the Brits have had to put up with understanding the language of the Streetwise Americans for years.That aside, the movie is excellent, and offers a very welcoming feel good factor. There are rumours of a Hollywood remake, but I doubt if it will have the same kind of kudos as the original.Oh, and for foreign fans who can't get enough, UK TV company, Channel 4 has just released a TV series of Lock Stock...but with completely different characters, although Richie is still there.The TV episodes are very good, especially if you haven't seen the movie. But for those who have...well....it's not quite the same.****/*****",9,0,0,2 July 2000
The Untouchables," A Muddled film relying on 80s style over lack-lustre content
","A fairly humdrum retelling of the Chicago gangster wars of the 20s & 30s and in particular Elliot Ness' long term battle bringing top gangster Al Capone to book on a range of  charges from murder, prohibition & bootlegging to his eventual downfall of simple tax evasion.De Palma does a pretty bad hash with this movie. Firstly, he is hard pushed into thinking of any original cinematography he can genuinely call his own. The most blatant rip off is the 'Odessa Steps' scene at the train station which was originally done so masterfully decades ago in the Russian film Battleship Potyomkin (1925).And I doubt if the real Ness swaned around in designer clothes back in the 20s either. But then again this is the yuppy 80s we're talking about when this film was made, so I suppose it wasn't cool to be wearing anything less than a Label.Then we have  the actors. Connery really does amaze me sometimes. He plays Malone a bit like Office Dibble out of Top Cat, unsure of what accent to use and always coming out with words of wisdom but never really convincing us with any true conviction. Although his death scene was quite moving otherwise he was as wooden as a beer keg.Costner again excels as a man with a total charisma bypass. He sparkles from time to time but generally he just plods through the story in his customary dot to dot style.The only shining light would be De Nero as the Big C himself. Totally convincing, totally ruthless, played just right - never drifting into characature, never falling into cliche, De Nero is excellent. And of course who can forget his little baseball story around the dinner table!The only criticism with De Nero is that we don't get to see enough of him; we don't get the chance to absorb his character or understand his evil mannerisms. De Palma offers simple sign posting telling the audience that this guy is all bad and that's all you need to know.The supporting cast give a good account of themselves, especially Garcia & Martin-Smith. The production values are obviously high & lavish but all this eye candy & stylish camera work doesn't make for a good film with an underworked script. De Palma is too heavy handed with his character development with regards the good guys - hense the heavy emphasis on Ness being a good family man, doting wife, child & baby on the way. All done in about 10 minutes.The same with Connery, simple explanations so that we can feel for this old time cop and then the scene is set to do battle with the invincible foe, who we don't get to know much about.The musical score is very upbeat & concise which is perhaps the only good thing about the movie; that and some decent lighting & 2nd unit camera work.Overall, a film full of other people's ideas packaged with 80's designerism & style over content but with nothing new to offer. **/*****",8,0,2,16 July 2000
The Godfather: Part III," Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit
","One of the great benefits of buying DVD is that in most cases you not only get the film itself but also loads of extras that can only add to the overall feel & premise of the movie itself.I recently bought the DVD Collectors pack of The Godfather saga which not only included the three original cinema versions but also the usual extras such as picture galleries, the Corleone family tree, biographies and additional scenes that only appeared in the TV versions.But the two best features of all were the Director's commentary overlaid for each film and also a separate documentary focusing on the rather difficult productions of all three Godfather films from inception in 1970 to the conclusion in 1990. When I viewed the video version of GIII some years ago I was rather disappointed by the rather bloated & totally unbelievable story concerning corruption and murder within the Vatican by the Mafia.Not only was a I disappointed by the story but also I felt the acting was weak compared to its two predecessors, with the film solely dependent on Al Pacino carrying the torch throughout the saga, while the supporting cast drifted in and out like passing ships in the night.However, now that I have viewed the DVD version along with the behind-the-scenes documentary I can begin to appreciate some of the problems director Coppola faced during the making of GIII.For years Paramount were very keen for GIII to be made, with or without Coppola behind the lens. So desperate were they that up to 15 initial drafts were put forward from different screenwriters but none ever saw the light of day. But on top of this Paramount were not even bothered whether Coppola directed or not since they felt confident that nearly any competent director could carry on the Saga Coppola had so successfully conceived during the 70s with I and II. There are many good directors who could have done this but when one reads that Sylvestor Stallone had been pencilled in by Paramount not only to direct but also to star, one has to consider the sanity of the studio execs at the time.And even when Coppola & Puzo were roped in they had to rush the scripts through in weeks rather than in months so it is not wholly surprising the screenplay looks half-baked.And then of course there is the inclusion of Coppola daughter Sofia as a last minute replacement to more accomplished actress Winona Ryder. It wouldn't have been so bad had her character been no more than a supporting role. But Sofia was asked to play Mary Corleone, daughter to Michael and heir to the entire Corleone business empire.Regrettably the task was to great for someone so young and with so little major acting experience and as a consequence was one of the major faults within the film with poor Sofia panned by both critics and fans alike. It seems strange that Francis cast his daughter for such a major role at such short notice but cast her he did and I guess his decision will forever haunt him.Another omission was that of Robert Duvell as Tom Hagen. GIII was in desperate need of some familiar faces from the previous movies to make the saga complete. However, with the exception of Pacino himself the only significant stars who reprised their roles were Diane Keaton & Talia Shire.Both Keaton & Shire give good solid performances with the latter having a far more significant role than before. But all the same I felt Pacino was very much on his own now that Duvell had been left out due to contract disagreements. I felt the inclusion of Tom (at any cost) would have added more gravitas to the movie. Duvell's character was very prominent & stong in the previous two movies and this was emphasised all too clearly by his absence in III.I liked the story; at least in part. Pacino was excellent as the elderly Don trying to shake off the ghosts & horrors of his past and his determination to go 'legit' not only for himself but for his family (not his Mafia family on this occasion but his true family - his wife and children)This part of the story was well done & very moving but was let down badly with the main storyline of corruption and murder within the Vatican by Mafia henchmen over big business dealings & power sharing. This was so unbelievable that any passion & feeling I had for Pacino's wish to be a decent man again went right out of the window by this overblown and frankly stupid premise.However, putting this film in the context of what I have learnt from the documentary I have to say that Coppola shouldn't be blamed completely for this relative flop. The execs at Paramount should hang their heads in shame for trying to rush the screenplay through too quickly and not trusting Coppola's own judgement. I could understand their anxiety if they were dealing with an unknown director but to undermine Coppola with his own movie legacy is a disgrace.GIII is not a bad film by any standards. If one takes a huge pinch of salt then the Vatican storyline can be tolerated. But for the Godfather purists GIII ended up as a wasted opportunity and will always be consigned as the weakest of the three films. In addition one has to feel sympathy for Sofia Coppola for no matter what she does now or in the future she will always be remembered for her rather poor performance in Godfather III.***SPOILER*** I loved the ending, it was so underplayed and yet so moving that for a moment I completely forgot about the utter farce that had gone on minutes before. But to see Pacino sitting in his orange grove an elderly man, crippled & blind and subsequently dying was well done and very open to suggestion. For we are not told whether he died a free man or whether the guilt of his past misdemeanours went with him. But it was very touching of Coppola to continue the 'orange fruit' symbolism significant throughout the entire saga ***END OF SPOILER***

Die Hard," A Towering action thriller full of wit, style & drama
","Of all the action films to come out of Hollywood in the late 80s early 90s, Die Hard is perhaps the Mother of all of them. There is something strangely comforting about Bruce Willis' role as cop John McClane. We know the plot is quite ridiculous and yet Willis is so believable as the all action anti-hero that we go along with it all.DH is superior to movies like Lethal Weapon, Terminator, Speed & Mission Impossible because of Willis' charisma & personal charm which is not generally found with actors like Gibson, Arnie & Cruise.Another bonus about DH is that even though there are a lot of special effects we don't get bombarded with hi-tech unrealistic gadgets & hardware. Everything in the film is played with a genuine style & substance that is such a key factor with any John McTiernan movie. McClaine has to rely on his own wits & spirit for human survival while his contemporaries (Arnie, Cruise etc) can fall back on all those gadgets to get them out of a fix. 
Ably supporting Willis is Alan Rickman, a theatrical actor by nature, but really excels as the rather civilised yet evil German terrorist Hans Gruber, adding a little European style to heaps of American panache.It sometimes gets bogged down with the buddie-buddie relationship between white cop/black cop, while adding the FBI into the story is more of a distraction than an aid.DH is still the best of the trilogy, although whether Bruce feels up to donning the White Vest again in DH4 we will have to wait and see.

Army of Darkness," A Massive Letdown
","Gosh, this film is bad and hugely disappointing on so many levels!
But then my hopes weren't high when I knew Universal Studios had got their horrible mitts on it and started dictating the script and production values, culminating in a utterly typical ending!From being a truly horrifying, no-holds-barred blood and guts from the first two EV films, but polished with some brilliant dark humour and a perfectly campy role by Campbell, we end up this half-baked mix of fantasy & Arthurian legend, with little or no effective horror or gore to speak of.The sfx are not great, but neither is the script as a whole; and it all looks seriously dated and incredibly un-engaging.Campbell's charisma just about holds everything together, but the film as a whole really is a poor effort after waiting something like 5 years since the far superior Evil Dead 2 graced our screens.",4,3,6,27 April 2018
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Hard, fast & furious
","Another typically efficient movie from director John McTiernan, better than DH2 butlags slightly on originality compared to the first.Rather than following the same one man against them all scenario as witnessed in the first 2 movies, McTiernan offers a bit more variety with a buddy-buddy Lethal Weapon formula, which works very well.Jackson outcools Willis by a wide margin as Zeus the black electrician from Harlem who gets involved in saving Willis' life. Jackson hardly has to work his character very hard because it is so becoming of his great talents.Willis is of course excellent as the picked-on cop who has now seen his marriage & career flush down the pan, and yet he is still in demand - by all the bad guys! As soon as Willis dons that white vest he seems to turn into Superman as he gets involved in so many scrapes, stunts, chases and shootouts you have to believe the guy is protected by Kryptonite.Once again McTiernan  goes to Europe for the mainstream baddy, and what better choice than Jeremy Irons playing the typically shrewd, cool & stylish German out to revenge the death of his brother at  the hands of Willis from the first movie.Three fine actors make the film far more interesting than it would have been had it relied on just the special effects and B grade actors. In fact the SFX do take over the film a little too much and we are asked to stretch our believability ever further.But this isn't a serious criticism. DH3 sparkles with excess, humour & drama. It also tries to poke a little fun at Political Correctness without really offending anyone.A good film, although whether Willis has got the will power to don the vest again we will have to wait and see.***/*****",Null,0,0,21 July 2000
Con Air," Rambo takes to the skies
","Con Air is your typical crash, bang, wallop Jerry Bruckheimer kind of movie. Loud & blatant pyrotechniques, lots of shouting and bad language; a dumb-downed script, actors act by the join-the-dots method, and not a lot of subtlety.The plot, such as it is, has the worst kind of scum all being dumped on the same plane as Mr Nice Guy, Nic, who has just served a 7 year jail term on a jumped up charge.There's lots of stern faces, flexed biceps & fixed stares, but you begin to wonder who is using the brain cell between this motley crew.Nic Cage acts like sly stallone & Bruce Willis rolled into one with equal numbness but ends up like Hommer Simpson and gives us the impression he'd rather be somewhere else. ('Duh, put....duh...the....bunny...duh....back!')Cage talks like an old-fashioned LP playing at the wrong speed; Cussack & Meaney are the comic relief who spend most of their time calling each other a__holes & much worse along with lots of running/flying around.Buscemi is always fun to watch - a bit like the whining kid in the classroom; and here he thinks his Hannibal the Cannibal with a fixed smirk and a worrying choice of bondage-wear.The only person I really felt for was John Malkovich - playing the chief baddie with the loaned-out brain cell. You just knew he was only in the movie for the money and not to stretch his considerable acting talent. But to be fair he played the part with gusto and in real life would have kicked Cage (and his fluffy bunny) into touch!This film would suit those people who like a crazy Saturday night at home with the gang and a few tinnies. There's just no point in being critical for its lack of intelligence because that would miss the point.Con Air is hokum pure & simple, and yet its fun to watch when you want to unwind big time. Forget the plot and the gaping loopholes, just sit back in the chair flick on your Dolby Pro Logic, position your speakers around the room and let the film immerse you for a couple of hours!**/*****",4,8,21,17 June 2000
Jaws," We definitely need a bigger boat!
","***SPOILER*** Oh happy days of 25 years ago. Seeing those TV trailers of a girl skinny-dipping at night, followed by the John William's motif dum-dum-dum score, then of Brody's look of dismay on the beach as another young swimmer bites the dust(seaweed?); ending with the 'We need a bigger boat' and a brief glimpse of the 20 footer ('25...Three tons of him')Off I dashed to the local cinema only to find queues doubling around the block eager to see this true blockbuster. The theatre lights dimmed, the packed crowd focussed; the curtains opened. First the Universal motif followed by that awesomeDa Dum....Da Dum Da Dum...dum dum dum dum....and we're off...As a bratty 13 year old back then, raised on action movies & horror novels prior to this, I have never been so scared in all my life after watching Jaws. It proves you don't have to use loads of gratuitous violence (Halloween, Scream - good movies but reliant on the visual rather than the abstract) to get your message across.Spielberg gets the ingredients spot on in every dept - the music we already know about, never has the big JW produced a more sinister motif for a movie that stays in your consciousness years after seeing the movie than this.The Editing deserves special mention because Verna Fields knows how to play with the audience, offering us brief glimpses of the horror from the deep. That's all we need, because William's score lets us know when the shark's around.The directing also is a tribute to the Big 'S' himself. It's a pity he didn't win an Oscar, although I supposed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (its major rival at the time) won the sympathy vote. But Spielberg really does drive the film forward with a very tight script (pruned extensively from the rather bogged down & overlong 'talky' novel) and some keen cinematography that would serve him so well in years to come.But top honours have to go the three men on the boat. Scheider, Dreyfuss & Shaw all confessed to hating the movie during production especially Dreyfuss who felt it would damage his mainstream intellectual movie status after starring in the acclaimed Duddy Kravitz which he was publicising at the same time as making Jaws.But the end result is a perfect chemistry between  the old sea dog (Quint); the eager young know-it-all rich kid (Hooper) and the ex-New York cop wanting a quieter life in the sticks but hates water (Brody).This film is still excellent  25 years on. And I still believe it carries one of the scariest moments in all of movieland - the head in the hull of the boat had everyone in the theatre jump in unison and it still makes me whince even now.My biggest regret though was seeing the shark being blown up at the end. Afterall, the shark is only doing what it does naturally and generally doesn't bother with bathers in real life. And yet after this movie was released back in the late 70s there was an instant backlash against any shark. Sharkhunters culled them and numbers dwindled, and Jaws, initially was to blame for that.Hopefully with a more environmentally aware audience these days the re-release of Jaws will have more positive effects than before.Anyway, for those who have yet to see this glorious moment in cinema history, go see it and be scared...very..very scared.*****/*****",9,0,1,16 July 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," If ever a film deserved a bag of Oscars, this is it!
","When one thinks of how many dross films have somehow managed to win Oscars you begin to lose faith when the classic SR doesn't even win one.For the life of me I don't know why this film was overlooked - sure the critics didn't like it, and it didn't do too well at the Box Office because the title was just too difficult or ambiguous to remember. Nevertheless by the time it went to Video the film has had a second life to the point where it is in the top three films of all time according to the members of IMDb, and rightly so.Prison films are nothing new of course, and neither is SR. But SR shines from so many areas that it has to be the best prison film ever.I was particularly impressed with the cinematography from Roger Deakins, especially those wonderful sweeping pan shots from of the prison taken from above.The acting is a revelation from all concerned especially Morgan Freeman who really should have won an Oscar. But then there's Robbins himself who I've never really warmed to, except perhaps for Jacobs Ladder. But he really is a tour-de-force here and should be proud of this film.But the acting plaudits go deeper than just the two main stars; the support from Bob Gunton, William Sadler & especially Clancy Brown also deserve huge credit.Its a very hard, uncompromising film but it doesn't play to stereotype. The violence is very real and yet warranted I think. It does fall to the cliche trap on one or two occasions - the ending, although generally well done, was perhaps just a little pretencious for my liking, especially the preachy monologue from Freeman jarred just a tad.Another annoying thing is the ageing process. Robbins hardly ages at all during his 20 year stay...but I'm quibbling.SR is a superb, moving & rewarding film full of hope & belief. The sudden surge of emotional energy that went through me as Robbins stands in the pool, his arms outstretched as the rain lashes down on him!In my virtual world The Shawshank Redemption won 10 Oscars and became a Box Office champ and was loved by the critics. The real world, just like the real world outside Shawshank Prison, is simply too cruel to want to think about!",10,0,0,18 June 2000
Platoon," America's second finest Vietnam War film
","Platoon is certainly one of my favourite war films from any particular era, although it doesn't quite reach the same intensity of Apocalypse Now or All Quiet on the Western Front. But it does have a more natural honesty about it than say Saving Private Ryan.What I particularly liked about the film was the way America wasn't only fighting the Vietnamese but also with the liberals & conscientious-objectors back home AND their own internecine squabbles between the men themselves.Oliver Stone's script & personal hands-on reflections of his own Tour of Duty don't hark upon the out-and-out conflict against the enemy. Instead he tries to point the camera at the young conscripts themselves. One minute they're thinking of college educations and a decent, well-paid job; the next they're out in the jungle being ripped to shreds by lethal blades of long grass, eaten by ants, blood-sucked by leaches, and that's even before you factor-in the enemy and their on-the-ground tactical supremacy.Charlie Sheen is at his very best as Chris, the new recruit, or 'Crusader'. A rich kid who volunteered to do his bit for his country, although this could have been down more to peer pressure than a sense of duty.But through his eyes & words we can see how the war affected so many American men in so many different ways. Fortunately, Stone doesn't go a stage further by incorporating the hateful voices back home who decry the invasion. It would have been interesting to see Chris's reaction to that kind of 'civil war' and wondering who side he is really on!The (very) ending is perhaps a little contrite & too nicely packaged, which smells of studio interference; but for the other 99% of the movie I was totally immersed in the raw energy & emotion these soldiers gave supporting a country they probably never knew existed and for a reason they were never properly told.It could be argued that the film reeks with an air of Stone's typical liberal attitudes, but one thing that can't be forgotten - Stone was out there fighting someone else's war, he did see action and so who are we to disagree.****/*****",8,0,0,8 August 2000
Halloween," A Chilling Reminder of Carpenter During His Prime!
","Contains Spoilers!! John Carpenter's best years for movies were in the 70s when he was very much an unknown working the independent-studio circuit and making films as cheaply as possible with limited finances but without sacrificing the quality that goes into such superb film.And as a consequence from 1974 to roughly 1986 Carpenter offered us such classic indies as, Dark Star, Assault On Precinct 13, The Fog, The Thing and Big Trouble in Little China. All of them had their cult following and all of them had a lot of film critics buzzing with praise & plaudits but only Halloween became perhaps one of the most influential movies in movie history.Although a generally simple concept of a maniac-on-the-loose, that had done before in lesser films previous to Halloween in '78, a lot of them lacked the style and above all, the sheer terror of this Carpenter offering.Even the opening titles were enough to set the mood in no uncertain terms: a halloween pumpkin with a rather threatening 'smile' slowly coming into the camera's focus while a pair of synthesizers pound out one of those nerve-jangling & ominous film scores that really sets the mood.Then we see a POV of our killer stalking the house of his sister who is making out with her boyfriend late at night. He then makes his way into the house when the boyfriend has left, enters her bedroom and then stares for what seems like forever before killing her.So far, so normal. This kind of thing has been done a few times although never quite so calculating or sucessful. But what really makes this scene so shocking is that we then get to look at our killer, but instead of expecting some cruel & twisted adult, it is in fact the 6 year old boy of the sister he has just stabbed to death. And not only that but when the police arrive and capture him we find he was wearing a hockey mask throughout the entire murder.An absolutely shocking first few minutes that totally unsettles its audience right from the very first note of the film score to the removal of the hockey mask some 6 minutes later. Carpenter is clearly very influenced by the works of Hitchcock but he succeeds where other lesser directors failed and packaged an opening with such calculating menace that lets the audience know we're going to be in for a roller-coaster 90 minutes of terror.Throughout the film the lingering threat never seems to go away, even during the daylight scenes. Most horror films only really come alive when all is dark & sinister, but not so with Halloween. Carpenter uses everyday things to play hide & seek with our wits. One of the best examples is the escaped killer hiding behind a line of white bed sheets as he stalks the unsuspecting Jamie Lee Curtis. We get to see him only for an instant thanks to a sudden gust of wind that reveals his identity as the bed sheet tosses in the air. But for that one moment is just as terrifying as anything that goes on during the night, when an audience is expecting something horrible to happen.Carpenter, very much like Steven Spielberg's Jaws, likes to tease us and tantalise us with never revealing the presence of the 'monster' too early. He likes to play mind games with us so that we ourselves feel like we're been stalked in the same way.Another highlight in the film is the way Carpenter unsettles us even more with the treatment of the dead people the maniac has killed. Perhaps the best example is the corpse of a murdered girl lying on her bed with her throat cut and the real tombstone of the killer's first victim at her head. Such simple little devices that work so well in Carpenter's hands.Another similarity with the shark in Jaws is that this particular monster simply will not die as any normal person would do. Not even bullets, knives or falling out of first floor windows have any desired effect until perhaps the very ending. And as a consequence neither the audience or the potential victim in Curtis is allowed off the hook with a standard good-guy kills bad-guy finale.The acting, chiefly, from old master Donald Pleasence and newcomer, Jamie Lee Curtis, is to be honest the weakest part of the film, although Curtis just does enough to make us care enough for her welfare.Its also interesting that most of the killings that take place throughout the film occur usually straight after the eventual vicitms have had sex. I guess a lot of psychiatrists watching had a great deal to say about that.It is not surprising, therefore, that this film became one of the biggest box-office successes in the horror genre ever, and by itself created a whole new industry of what is now somewhat unkindly called 'slasher movies' but spawned some great films like 'Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'Friday 13th', and both of those films had their own franchises as well.As for Carpenter, well he hasn't hit the high notes ever since 'Big Trouble In Little China' back in 86 and even that film wasn't all that great. Ever since then he has had a succession of poorly directed or poorly received horror movies that simply don't have those key ingredients so evident in Halloween, which is a great great shame.The logic of Halloween doesn't stand up to close scrutiny but back in the late 70s this film set the world alight and Halloween nights were never quite the same again!***/*****",Null,0,0,25 August 2002
Blade Runner," A Classic That Will Run & Run
","Its remarkable to think this film is now 20 years old and on initial release bombed at the box office both in the US and here in the UK. This wasn't helped by a film beset with behind-the-scenes problems:-a/discontent & disagreements behind the scenes between actors (primarily Harrison Ford) and director Ridley Scott.b/ the mainly US film crew not warming to the exacting  & seemingly arrogant nature of the relatively inexperienced new Brit  on the block, Scott.c/ the rather nervous producers & accountants realising from an early stage that this kind of movie was not going to be in the same action-fest, mega-buck-block-buster as Star Wars, but would instead take on a rather more darker, slower, morose theme coupled with an ever-increasing budget that eventually broke a film studio;d/ the intervention of the studio in forcing Scott to go for the highly controversial 'Studio Cut' version with an upbeat but highly unlikely tacked-on ending & a rubbish overdub narrative, which totally ruined the balance of Scott's original cut until a Director's Cut was issued in 92 with a more satisfying conclusion.e/ problems with the scripts, screenplays, the screenwriters and the original author himself Philip K Dick, who wrote Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which inspired the film.f/ the various inconsistences within the film - were there 6 replicants or only 5 when they visited Earth; the poor editing & sound; the ongoing argument as to whether Deckard himself was a replicant etc.
But to the film...... ...is set 20 years in the future. Colonisation of other planets has begun leaving only an underclass left to inhabit the big cities like Los Angeles, a place of continuing black rain, darkness, pollution & social bleakness.However, robots (or replicants as they're called) are in full service off-world, doing all the dangerous jobs humans don't want to do. Six of these replicants mutiny, kill people and return to Earth in search of their creator.The leader of this highly intelligent, highly dangerous band is Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer - in my opinion his best ever role) who realises that all replicants only have a 4 year life span. Roy & co. want that extended, considerably!The police are informed and bring in their top Blade Runner (Harrison Ford) to hunt and 'retire' these renegades. And so begins 90 minutes of detective work, investigation, murder, abstract romance & intrigue.Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, Thelma & Louise), has always been criticised for his films being all 'style over substance'. It is true to say that Blade Runner is a visually stunning masterpiece although the quality of the character-development & storyline pace is erratic & plodding to say the least.However, the film holds up very well. Those expecting something akin to Star Wars meets Raiders of the Lost Ark, will be disappointed. The action sequences are few & far between; the story is mature and therefore slow to develop. The special effects are very good & realistic although not on a par with today's CGIs, which I believe is a good thing.Harrison Ford is given a much more rounded character as Deckard the Blade Runner rather than the comic-strip hero of Raiders & Star Wars. As a consequence he finds it very difficult to offer any real depth or emotion as Deckard.The real acting honours goes to Hauer as Ford's nemesis: suitably under played but with a hint of Aerian menace and ends the film with a beautifully rendered monologue of his short life!Overall then, Blade Runner (the Director's Cut) is a superior film with only a few short comings. It's best viewed on the big screen in 70mm THX sound, but the tv compromise is nearly as good. The music by Vangelis is just SO perfect, coupled with some fine visual effects and camera work by Jordan Cronenweth, Terry Rawlings & David Snyder.There are rumours of yet another Director's Cut for 2003 based of Scott's original ideas that were latter scuppered by the studio (that forced him into churning out the first version with the 'happy ending'); and then scuppered again with a compromise Director's Cut version, which despite of its title still wasn't Scott's original version.And then of course there is the ongoing rumour of either a sequel or prequel. A rumour that has been buzzing on the Blade Runner chatboards of the internet for years and yet nothing has yet to materialise, and hopefully it never will.Blade Runner is a cult movie that has risen from the ashes of apparent failure at the box office. Much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it captivated a public with the darker side of science fiction, a fiction so close to our own reality that we feel more engrossed and fearful of what this film says about our dependence on cybernetics, the ecology of the planet and mad scientists no different from the Frankensteins of the past trying to tell us that the future of robotics (and human cloning in particular) will be a blessing to humanity and not a terror to be feared.Highly recommended*****/******",9,1,2,17 August 2002
The Matrix," Tedium Beyond Belief
","I really cannot understand the hype & gushing praise for this sfx/cgi gloated film.The story is routine - a contemporary mix of Men In Black, Tron and a shedload of other '10 seconds to go before the world is destroyed' movies.The principle idea of a make-believe world called The Matrix, a world where we all live totally oblivious to the fact that this world is totally artificial and controlled by machines, could have been immensely interesting in the hands of a better set of scriptwriters & directors. In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out 'wow' the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of 'jaw dropping' effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual 'no one's home' expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated. Once you've viewed the film more than a couple of times and got used to the sfx you then want to look for more depth only to find that its only the sfx that holds the film together.BAD!**/*****",7,5,9,27 August 2001
Apollo 13," A Science Fiction film that is all Science Fact
","An excellent space movie based on the true events of the aborted Apollo 13 mission to the Moon. Of course for those of us who are old to remember the moon missions we already know the ending. However, Ron Howard does an excellent of making this 'remake' even more breathtaking & astounding than the real event!There was always the risk of Hollywood taking 'dramatic' liberties with this movie, but fortunately they resisted temptation for major chances and kept faith with the whole traumatic tale.Never being a keen fan of Tom Hanks (Jim Lovell) I was really surprised & delighted with his performance here. In real life Hanks had taken a close interest with the Apollo story and so in the movie he really plays his character with great enthusiasm & intelligence.He is also ably supported by one of Kevin Bacon's best performances and particularly from Bill Paxton.The only troublesome acting came from Kathleen Quinlann, playing Lovell's wife. She isn't given much to do throughout the film other than to cry a bit and offer moral support to her family and friends. Quinlann is a very capable actress but I felt she wasn't given enough to do here other than play the helpless-woman role, which is a great pity.However, top honours has to go to Ed Harris as the MC chief. I've always like under-rated Harris, especially in the earlier GlennGarry Glenn Ross movie. In both films he seems to excel as the man struggling to stay in control and walk the fine line. Although in this movie he goes that little bit further with an added intensity that gives a lot more human impact to the movie than perhaps Hanks offered, who's dialogue at times seemed to drone on in a robotic-like monotone.Top marks to the special effects too, which unlike getting in the way of a good story, simply adds to the real-life drama.Possibly Howard's best movie to date and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to check on their space history.****/*****",9,1,3,5 July 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Help Help, I'm being Oppressed!
","A marvellous film that will have anyone with a slightly silly disposition fall in love with. Its typical Python from the the TV series, with rapid irreverent clips interlacing the rather scatty story of Arthur looking for the Holy Grail.Of course a lot of criticism was directed at the apparently limp & sudden ending, with perhaps audiences expecting a punchline to appear shortly after but was never forthcoming. Its true that the ending was a little confusing but its typical Python, coupled with a dwindling budget and a lack of ideas as to how to really end the film.Holy Grail looks pail compared to the latter Life of Brian movie which enjoyed a larger budget from a bigger studio. But Grail had the virginal charm that perhaps wasn't very apparent with Brian; everything seemed very adhoc, adlibbed & incidental which gave the movie a sparkling & refreshing charm about it.There are many scenes where the attempt at humour falls on deaf ears, but this is to be expected. It would be rare indeed to find a movie that retained its humour throughout. But a large proportion of the jokes do succeed, big time. Especially the Bring Out Your Dead scene and the Black Knight at the bridge - sick, but excellent.John Cleese has always been my favourite Python actor and I kept on half expecting him to reprise his dead Parrot sketch somehow.My favourite Python film of all - it had charm. wit, exuberance, energy and plenty of good laughs to boot!***/*****",9,0,0,5 July 2000
All the President's Men," A masterful retelling of political corruption at the top.
","It took me sometime to really comprehend the true scale of the Watergate scandal prior to seeing this movie. From an Englishman's point of view my interest in American politicals was peripheral to say the least, since up until the 72/73 US politics was 99% Vietnam war coverage.However, after watching the film and reading the more detailed book from which the film is based I have to say that this is one of the best political movies I have seen.I was initially sceptical about using Redford & Hoffman playing the lead roles, thinking that they would play to the cameras letting their egos get in the way.But how wrong I was. Both play their journalistic roles with outstanding realism, especially from the slightly less mature Redford who seems to have a prerequisite in some of his movies whereby he has to bed at least one woman. But in this movie it's all boys talk, no subplots, no love interests just pure history telling at the highest level.But its not just the leads that carry the film. The support is just too good not to mention - Hal Holbrook as the anonymous Deep Throat, Jason Robards as the Kennedy-loving Ben Bradlee, editor of the Washington Post; and special mention must go to Warden & Balsam as deputy editors and Jean Alexander as the bookkeeper who played a key part in the final downfall of the president.With this kind of detailed political complexity its probably worth viewing the film a couple of times to really get to grips with some of the more subtle points.And of course it should be noted that Watergate wasn't the main reason for Nixon's resignation although it was a major factor. For a more rounded account of his fall from grace track down Nixon starring Anthony Hopkins. This film will fill in all the other details that President's Men didn't touch on.*****/*****",10,1,1,16 July 2000
Evil Dead II," Evil Dead 2 - GROOVY!!
","ED2 is not, repeat NOT, to be taken seriously. Sure its a horror film that tries (and to some extent succeeds) in scaring the audience, but at the same time it lampoons the horror & gore with slapstick comedy.I suppose it must have been a tricky job for director Raimi deciding on the right mix between comedy & horror because normally both genres are complete opposites.He didn't get the mix right first time round with ED1, but then again he didn't have the budget either; but with ED2 everything is just right.Bruce Campbell reprises his original ED1 role as Ash, taking his girlfriend to a very remote country retreat (I sometimes wonder what kind of girlfriend, or anyone for that matter, would fancy spending a few days in a cottage in the deepest forest & highest  mountain retreat in the US, but never mind.)Anyway, Ash find the Book of the Dead and a tape recorder. He plays it back and we're smothered in all sorts of incantations & sinister spells that have somehow raised the spirits of the dead within the forest. And from that point on the action begins in earnest as Ash battles the demons, zombies, ghosts & other horrible creations (no lawyers unfortunately!)The violence & gore are plentiful and yet tolerable. We don't shriek away like we would do if it was a pretty young thing from Scream or Halloween; instead its just a straight battle against the good guys & girls against the bad.But it's the clever slapstick that really makes this film so richly entertaining. The wandering Hand, is truly a classic piece of cinema, and I loved the way it gave the Finger to Ash in total defiance but then got its own comeuppance in a mouse trap!Then there's the chainsaw (Ash's new appendage for the lost hand); and from that point on we know the movie has moved away from the real sinister beginning to something a bit more convivial & tasteless.The camerawork is really good, especially the 1st person scenes with the camera playing the Forest Demon chasing after Ash in his own home.
Raimi too deserves praise for making a better, rounded film treating the audience with a little more respect & intelligence than he did with the first (there's no tree rape scene here thank goodness!)But top marks must go to Campbell, who plays Ash with a passion & kinetic vigour that you don't often see these days. The best thing is that he did nearly all of his own stunts - especially when he has to throw himself around the room smashing plates in his face etc.It's a shame that he hasn't really broken into the Major studio circuit and will probably be always labelled as 'Ash, the cool man with the handy chainsaw & a mission with Hell.'GROOVY!!!***/*****",Null,0,1,9 July 2000
