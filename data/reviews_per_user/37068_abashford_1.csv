Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually stunning, but an awful movie...
","I should have recognized the re-releases of Episodes IV-VI for what they were: a warning of things to come.The re-realases didn't add anything of substance, and in fact detracted from the original pictures.  Phantom Menace did an even better job at this.
To put excellent actors like Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson in this picture and not allow their artistic ability to shine is a awful shame.  If they had removed all Jar-Jar's lines (and preferably Jar Jar) and instead allotted the recovered time to Ewan and Liam to develop their characters this would have been a MUCH better film (maybe even good)!Some will argue that the purpose of this movie is to set up episodes II and III, and therefore doesn't warrant a decent plot or chatacter development. I disagree, every movie should stand on its own, just as they did in the original series (and yes I am counting Empire).(Quality of the movie) divide by (hype) equals my rating of 1.Visually stunning, but an awful movie.",1,0,1,21 July 2001
