Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," conflicted
","I did enjoy this. I need to say that right off the bat, entertaining, hilarious in parts. The film does loose steam, and becomes a one-joke movie and this is where I believe I have problems with it. And the problems I have with it emerged only upon chatting about it with friends. What BORAT shows and completely takes advantage of is the kindness and politeness of Americans. Here is a guy who, by all rights, should be tossed out of most situations he's in... But watch it again, think about it some more... the victims (frat boys aside, idiots) they really have a tolerance, a welcoming nature that Cohen exploits (not that it's not funny) but I'm conflicted with how I'm reacting to the movie.",5,4,8,24 November 2006
