Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," May The Farce Be With You
","Wow I never imagined that Star Wars could sink to these lows.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The plot is extremely boring - who cares about a trade federation?  The acting and writing are ridiculous - Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd are especially weak.  Overall, the whole movie just feels like it was created by a marketing team.  I could literally picture the shrinkwrapped toy sets and video games that each scene was laying the foundation for.  I won't even talk about Jar Jar Binks.  With this pathetic attempt, Lucas manages to cheapen the entire Star Wars series. What a shame.",2,0,1,27 November 2001
Minority Report," No more Spielberg for me
","How annoying - First - I pay admission to a movie.  Then I have to watch 10 minutes of commercials.  Then I have to watch 15 minutes of movie commercials (previews).  Why, then, should I be forced to watch 15-20 advertisements within the body of the film itself?  Lets see, I'll name off the top of my head the companies whose logos were prominently featured in this film:  The Gap, Burger King, USA Today, Newsweek, HydroGrow, Remo, Lexus, Bvlgaria, etc. etc. etc.  There were many more that I can't even remember.  It's pretty sad when a movie can contain more product placements than a Bond film, but this one sure does.  It's a sign that Spielberg has respect for only one thing - his wallet.  If I am going to be forced to watch this many advertisements during the movie I should get in for free.Secondly - we don't need Biggie-Size fries, we don't need Biggie-Size cokes, and we don't need Biggie-Size films either.  Why do all film-makers these days insist on making 3 hour long movies?  There was enough story in this film to fit nicely into a 1 hour TV show.  There is no excuse for stretching it into 3 hours.  I can only suppose that these film-makers think that we want nothing more than to be exposed to their genius (and their sponsors' advertisements) for as much time as possible.  Sorry, I'll take a 90 minute film with a concise plot any day over 3 hours of chase scenes and explosions.Third - apparently Spielberg liked filling Kubrick's shoes in AI.  He's now trying to continue the trend by adding numerous avant-garde touches to this film.  Sorry, they all feel phony and contrived.  Stick with your own style Spielberg.I will say that visually the film is quite stunning.  Too bad it has no soul...",2,1,2,28 June 2002
Pitch Black," The best sci-fi film in years
","This is one absolutely not to miss.  The cinematography is highly experimental and cool.  The plot is fantastic - one of those that rewards the viewer the less he or she knows about the movie prior to seeing it. The characters are really fun to watch develop in the movie, and Vin Diesel is just awesome.  Do not miss this movie in the theaters!  Most of all - don't read any plot summaries.  Lastly, go to the official web site and check out the animated short 'prequel:.  It lends some great insight into the character development of a certain bad guy...",10,0,0,13 March 2000
The Fast and the Furious," Great racing scenes, dumb crime scenes
","Not a bad movie overall - some of the racing scenes, especially the first one, were truly awesome.  If they had just stuck to the racing, it would have been a great movie.  But they had to write in this really dumb crime plot involving hijacking of moving 18 wheeler trucks with little tiny Honda racecars.  I mean, what truck driver wouldn't just run over these little cars and be done with it?  Later on in the movie, motorcycles are hijacking moving cars at gunpoint.  Who in a car wouldn't just run over the motorcycles?  What reality do writers for movies like this live in?  But all in all, the racing scenes are good enough that it's probably worth seeing the movie anyways, but just be prepared to laugh at these ridiculous, needlessly complex hijacking scenes.",6,0,1,6 August 2001
Mulholland Drive," It does make sense
","For those who say that the movie does not make sense - it does, trust me. It makes perfect sense, but it takes a while to put all the pieces together. My wife and I were unraveling all the various bits and pieces for almost 2 hours after seeing it.  Trust me, there are very few loose ends in this stunning film.  If you like a good puzzle, see this film - and remember to leave plenty of time afterwards for discussion!",10,3,4,15 October 2001
The Mummy Returns," Sacrifices quality for quantity, but not bad
","The plot of this sequel picks up where its predecessor left off, with most of the cast from the previous film intact.  The plot itself is pretty interesting and well done, which is fairly unusual for a big sequel like this.  Unfortunately, the film spends most of its time on overdone action sequences.  When I say overdone, I'm talking about the fact that there is tons of CGI and martial arts style fighting, and everyone knows that you sacrifice quality for quantity.  What we're left with is a bunch of endless scenes where no take is over 2 seconds long in order to disguise the poor quality CGI and fighting skills of the actors.  It gives you a headache after a while.  However, most of the CGI where they actually give you time to look at it is beautiful and quite creative (with the exception of the final action scene, which is pretty pitiful).  Overall, the film is probably worth seeing if you like action films, but you'll walk out of the theater feeling like you've been beaten over the head with a club!",6,0,0,8 May 2001
From Hell," Too dark
","It's not really entertaining to watch defenseless women brutally butchered over and over and over again for 2 hours.  That's really about all there was to this movie.  The plot was not compelling, and the characters, while very well acted, were pretty thin.  I love a good horror movie, but this one just seemed to lack soul.",4,1,3,22 October 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A total waste of time
","When I first saw the preview for O Brother Where Art Thou, I said to myself 'That film looks terrible.'  I am a big Coen brothers fan - The Big Lebowski is among my favorite films and Fargo is a masterpiece.  However, something told me to just stay away from O Brother Where Art Thou.  After many months of convincing from friends that it was a great movie, I picked it up. 
What a waste of time.  The preview completely captures the essence of the movie.  It is a boring script that is made worse by pitiful acting performances, especially by George Clooney in the lead role.  Remember Keanu Reeves in Dracula?  That's the level of quality we're talking about here. Clooney could stay in his pseudo southern accent for no more than 2 or 3 seconds before he relapsed back to Batman or that guy on ER or any of the other terrible performances he has given in the past.  It was just pitiful to watch.  To me, the Coens have always made movies that make you laugh because of the intelligent humor in them.  In O Brother, they apparently went for slapstick and failed miserably.  If I wanted slapstick, I would watch Chris Farley and see it done much better.  I hope this film is not a sign of things to come.",2,2,7,4 February 2002
