Your Name.," Absolutely brilliant!
","Coming from a guy who normally watches series like bleach and naruto I decided to change up the genre a bit (because why the hell not ) So asked around to see what shows and films are so called 'awesome' and 'lit' and I heard the film ' your name ' appear quite frequently so I decided to watch it. Now I can honestly say this film definitely lives up to its hype. The character development outstandingly good, the premise was on a whole new level of excellence. Additionally the penultimate of the film kept me on edge, praying that the next outcome would be the one that I hoping for; it was exactly that! Absolutely brilliant!!!! 10/10",10,1,1,10 August 2018
