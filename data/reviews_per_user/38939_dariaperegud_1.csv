Walk the Line," I've seen something like this
","I haven't heard about Johny Cash before. My first thought was that it's a good name for a cool gangster. But for a musician it is really fantastic name. I'll remember it for all my life.
The film itself wasn't a great discovery for me. I found the story and film-making a bit predictable, like the usual bio-pic formula about a musician that you might expect.
In 2004 there was a film, a year before Walk the Line, called Ray. From the first episodes I understood that they are very alike. The same star's story. Nothing knew.
Nevertheless it is a really good film. What makes this movie stand out is the lead performance. Reese Witherspoon is unbelievably convincing as June Carter Cash. It was the first time when I heard her singing. Awesome!
Watch it! There is everything in this film: magnificent acting, detailed picture, good music and even Elvis.",8,0,0,4 March 2018
