Vertigo," Terrible
","Terrible acting. Terrible story.
James Steward's character is pathetic.
Movie from 2020 perspective is a bloody crap. Sorry Alfred. You didn't shine here.",2,5,18,4 January 2020
Captain Marvel," Mix
","It was a pleasent surprise.It was like, finally after a while, watching a good Star Trek movie. And a bit of MiB and Matrix.",6,2,5,1 June 2019
Justice League," Confusing
","I was actually looking forward to this movie after the awesomeness of Wonder Woman. But unfortunately the movie sucks. Even the CGI is badly done. I don't even want to mention the thing with Henry Cavill's mouth. Absolutely terrible. And the thing with the story. It is confusing. It is cheap. It is below average. It feels the mixture of every imaginable comic sci-fi movie.You can sense Thor, Iron man, The Avengers, Captain America, Guardians of the galaxy, The mummy, X-men, Transformers, Hellboy, Constantine, The priest, ... To put it shortly, it is a bloddy mess. There are some minor tiny moments I liked which were more drama oriented but that's it. Oh, I still love lovely Gal Gadot. Without her I wouldn't be wasting two hours of my life.",2,0,1,6 March 2018
Dunkirk," The land of the dead
","First of all this is very unconventional war movie. The movie itself has some stunning imagery and very impressive scenes. The lack of dialogues lets the viewer fills in lines and with that kind of silence Christopher Nolan lets the viewer fills in emotions and this kind of reminds me of the movie Thin red line. It is completely apolitical. And with the style Nolan took I don't resent him that. I don't think this is the question of political correctness. And from this point on the movie differentiates from the rest. The movie feels more like a myth than a record of historical event. Of course it is a record of historical event to some extent. But it is more like watching Greek mythology. Where soldiers are trapped in the land of the dead and shores of Dunkirk are just the entrance of the Hades' underworld where he with his two brothers Poseidon, the god of the sea, and Zeus, the god of the sky, tries to seal the fate of soldiers. And English channel is the only way in and out of the underground. All the small boats remind us of Greek mythology but instead of sailing people into the underworld here were trying so save them from certain death. Because soldiers were on the other side in Hades' realm they were powerless even though there were 400.000 of them. They were half alive and half dead. They seem mostly indifferent. Like most of them were under some kind of spell. Waiting, doing nothing, without true emotions and feelings just some gloomy dark fear was tearing them apart. And from that perspective the movie is again one masterpiece from Christopher Nolan.",8,0,1,25 December 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Boring
",Simply boring. I really don't care if I am told I misunderstood the movie. The movie was boring. Period. Everything else is Emperor's new clothes.,3,5,10,14 June 2020
Logan," Surprisingly good
","Take out fighting and killing - slaughtering and you get a pretty descent drama. I was actually very surprised that the movie had a story frame. Of course it is a fictional movie but has much more real elements that makes in more believable, much more grown up and mature. The Logan character was deeper, more life like and the whole story has some neat details which makes it a good movie. Of course Patrick Stewart was very good. The movie itself is very well directed and has plenty things going on and it leaves you with a feeling that movie is very long. Which it actually is with over 2h and 10m long. There could have been less fighting, but the director probably had to follow guidelines to make it more action like. Besides X-Men: First class which was great and X-Men: Days of Future Past which fell somehow behind the first one, Logan is the only X-men movie I like. All others were mostly story-less and dumb and childish.",7,3,6,6 September 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Do.Not.Watch
","I get this is a comic movie. But the stupidity is overwhelming. Terrible story told in a terrible way. The best part of the movie are corny last five minutes. I think that says it all. And by the way James Gunn has daddy issues judging by this movie. Oh, and yea, what can you expect from a guy who has written screen play for ScoobydooThe movie is so bad I even don't want to waste my time writing the review.",2,2,5,24 August 2017
Wonder Woman," Lovely Gal Gadot and great super heroine movie
","Finally a great super heroine movie which is a compliment to all great (and normal) women. Probably it helps that astonishing Gal Gadot is that super heroine. I was very pleasantly surprised about easy start and fairy tail like beginning. The whole movie has this nice pace. Like Logan it has very nice playing time, more than 2h 10m which is enough to tell a story and present characters. The movie it self, the story frame and the whole story flow reminded me of a Captain America: First avenger (which I also like). I actually like the story and the story frame. There are some moments where main character could have looked stupid but it is nicely played. Again the movie leaves you with a feeling that there is a lots of things going on. When you look back there really are some things that are going on in the movie. What I especially like with this movie is a super villain. He was not a typical one and was far better thought. Actually he was much deeper in a way that other super villains and it made some sense. The problem with superhero movies as I see it is when the story is bigger than the universe and when main villain is bigger than time presented in the story. This was not at all the case in this movie. That's why Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 totally sucks and Wonder Woman surprisingly doesn't.",8,9,19,6 September 2017
Alien: Covenant," Totally unworthy
","Nothing to see here. Boring, same old repetitive plot, the whole story line is based on stupid consequences, stupid assumptions and stupid characters and their stupid actions, because without this the story wouldn't exist. Did not answer any of Prometheus questions that were raised and had really to little questions about the life itself which Prometheus promised to the viewer.",3,2,3,7 August 2017
