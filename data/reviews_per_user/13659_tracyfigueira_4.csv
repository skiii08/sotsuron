The Sound of Music," is it just me, or does Julie Andrews look sexy in an apron?
","This is one of my favorite movies of all time, which is strange, because as a rule I avoid musicals. Happy, peppy people singing and dancing and clicking their heels with joy--give me a break! However, there are exceptions. I must be the only straight man with both this movie and 'The Wizard of Oz' in his video library. There is a reason: Julie Andrews. She had that knack (rare these days) of being sexy in a wholesome way. 'The Sound of Music' plays like an English-language version of the popular German/Swiss/Austrian genre the 'Heimatfilm' (homeland film), generally wholesome family dramas set in the Alpine region full of blond, blue-eyed Frauleins, lonely goatherds, and lots of yodeling. Since Salzburg is the home town of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, it seems more plausible for people to spontaneously break into song and dance here than it does in a New York ghetto ('West Side Story') or an oppressed Jewish village in czarist Russia ('Fiddler on the Roof.') There are dark clouds on the horizon, however, and as the Anschluss approaches, Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) of the defunct Austrian Navy (Austria is landlocked now, but until World War I their empire included coastal regions of Italy and Croatia) must decide where to take his stand. He makes his sentiments clear by ripping in half a Swastika flag and flees with his family. This is an immensely enjoyable film filled with beautiful music and great choreography. It's corny, sappy, and shamefully manipulative--but what's wrong with that?",Null,2,9,11 April 2009
Juno," the real deal
","'Juno' is one of two 2007 movies dealing with unwed pregnancy ('Knocked Up' was the other) and of the two I liked it much better. Self-appointed media watchdogs are already claiming that it glamorizes teen pregnancy, but personally I think Hollywood does far more harm by glamorizing smoking. If I had a teenage daughter (God forbid!) I'd much rather she become pregnant than take up smoking. Conservative critics should embrace this movie for its pro-life message. 'Juno' is a genuinely sweet, gentle feel-good movie starring one of the most beautiful and appealing starlets since Audrey Hepburn. I've fallen in love with Ellen Page (and Amy Adams of 'Enchanted.') Michael Cera is likable as her nebbishy boyfriend and Jennifer Garner gives a touching performance as a middle class housewife desperate for a baby and coping with an immature, shallow husband (Jason Bateman) who seems a better match for 16-year old Juno. This is one Hollywood film that does not patronize middle America or working class people. I was disappointed that Juno didn't keep the baby at the end, especially since Garner's character would have to raise it by herself, her good-for-nothing husband having flown the coop. Still, it was a wonderful movie and I hope to see more from Ellen Page.",10,2,6,29 July 2008
Kelly's Heroes," war for fun and profit
","Before there was 'Saving Private Ryan' there was 'Kelly's Heroes.' In both movies a sensitive but tough commander is asked to risk his men's lives on a mission that makes no sense whatsoever. But instead of having to bring back Matt Damon safe to his mama, Sergeant Big Joe (Telly Savalas) is asked to rob a bank in a provincial French town, which may or may not have $16 million in Nazi gold. Clint Eastwood is Kelly, the brainy operator who uncovers the trail of the gold, and he's aided and abetted by Sergeant Crapgame (Don Rickles), a behind-the-scenes black market dealer, and Oddball (Donald Sutherland), a spaced-out tank commander. This film is cheerfully anachronistic in projecting sixties style, attitude, and cynicism onto the 1940s. Every man is thoroughly unpatriotic, disillusioned with the system, and out for himself. Is this really World War II, or is it Vietnam? Sutherland's character is a hippie before hippies were invented. That having been said, let me assure you I love this movie. It is a total joy from beginning to end. Capitalizing off the success of 'The Dirty Dozen,' it seeks to recreate the formula with some of the same actors (Savalas, Sutherland). The film is chock-full of familiar faces from film and TV: Carroll O'Connor, Gavin McLeod, and even the ubiquitous Harry Dean Stanton (billed as Dean Stanton). Shot in Yugoslavia, the film successfully exploits Eastwood's iconic status in spaghetti westerns: the scene where Eastwood, Savalas, and Sutherland confront the SS tank commander who is the only thing standing between them and the gold is a witty send-off of Sergio Leone. 'Kelly's Heroes' is a near-perfect mixture of comedy, action, and male bonding. Perhaps the ultimate redneck movie.",9,1,4,11 April 2009
Paths of Glory," the greatest film ever made
","Now that 'The Dark Knight' has toppled 'The Godfather' from the #1 spot in the IMDb Top 250, only to be toppled in turn by 'The Shawshank Redemption,' might I be permitted to nominate this shamefully overlooked Stanley Kubrick classic from 1957? Made before he had perfected his unique signature, it has a raw, semidocumentary, almost cinema verite quality that distinguishes it from the more distant, formal films of Kubrick's maturity. Just compare it to 'Full Metal Jacket,' made exactly thirty years later. The film is short (less than an hour and a half) and there's no soundtrack aside from the relentless drum rolls. Kirk Douglas, whom I have often found hammy in other films, is perfect here as Colonel Dax, the sole voice of moral rectitude in a tale of double dealing, casual cruelty and Machiavellian intrigue. He's well-matched by his opponents: the deceptively suave Adolphe Menjou (the only Frenchman in the film) and the deranged Charles Macready. Interestingly, Menjou was one of Hollywood's premiere red-baiters, and played a key role in driving Chaplin from America. He plays a similar character here, and one wonders if he appreciated the irony. The black-and-white photography adds to the film's no-frills atmosphere. This film was considered so inflammatory that Kubrick was forbidden to shoot in France, and instead it was filmed in Germany, with German policemen doubling as French soldiers. 'Paths of Glory' was a commercial failure, but it led to Kubrick's second collaboration with Douglas, 1960's 'Spartacus,' which gave Kubrick the box-office clout he needed to make his later masterpieces. Without this film there might never have been a '2001: A Space Odyssey' or 'The Shining.'",10,1,3,20 September 2008
