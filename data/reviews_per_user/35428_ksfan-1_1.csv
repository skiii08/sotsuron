Marie Antoinette," Choppy storyline and awful ending
","The storyline was very choppy and did not flow at all! It was constantly skipping over time periods and it felt like they left out a lot of scenes. Likewise the ending was just awful. I sat there for 2 hours and felt like nothing ever happened. How is that possible? On the other hand, the costumes were beautiful and it was cool to see 17th century France, but there was no story! It is sad to say, but my favorite part of the movie was the first 5 minutes or so. I absolutely loved her little pug dog, but he wasn't in the rest of the movie. I watched this movie with a group of about 5 of my girl friends and we all agreed that it was a waste of our time since we left feeling worse than when we went in.",3,2,4,9 February 2007
