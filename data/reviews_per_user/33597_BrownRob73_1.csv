The New World," This movie blows!
","This movie has to be one of the biggest disappointments of all time! With the exception of Istar. I cannot believe that it was that bad! I really had high hopes for the movie as I am a history buff! Nonetheless, this movie was way off the mark and the acting was forced. It just blows. First, if your researched the history books, you would know that Pocahontas and Captain John Smith did not have romantic feelings for each other, in fact, when she saw him in England years later, she referred to John Smith as 'father'. Secondly, it was just plain creepy to try and force a fictitious relationship with two people (with one being under-aged) is just plain disgusting.",2,6,10,21 May 2006
