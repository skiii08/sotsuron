The Hangover," Funny , Stupid and Crazy
","When i first saw the trailer my friends and i decide to watch the movie. This has to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. For anyone who is prudish and can't tell by what the movie is rated or by the title of the movie, don't see. For anyone who has a sense of humor... you have to see this movie!!Funnier than Old School, Wedding Crashers, 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad put together ( maybe im laying it on a little bit) I was not at all expecting it to be this funny... go see it, its worth the money. And Omg i still can believe how hot is Bradley Cooper even in a movie like that he was so funny and handsome like always the whole movie i went was for him. Finally its an hilarious movie , u cant miss this movie!!",8,1,2,16 June 2009
