Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wish it was never made.
","So why does George Lucas believe adding 3D to this mess will make it any better? Who knows right, well do yourself a favor, if you have already seen Episode 1, try to forget about it, and if you haven't seen Episode 1 consider yourself lucky and never see it because it will ruin Star Wars in your eyes forever. All the great story lines of the original three and any chance of returning to the dark tone of The Empire Strikes back is completely gone for more of a, Ewok lets make as much money off the children style as ever(One name - Jar Jar Binks) guess aliens talk like Jamaicans in the Star Wars universe. The only thing worth sitting through in the entire film is the epic light saber battle at the end that kills off the greatest Star Wars character ever, Darth Maul (Episode III makes Darth Vader a whiny little girl.) In the end a little 3D is not worth re watching or viewing the largest disappointment in modern day cinema.",3,4,10,14 February 2012
Warrior," Impossible to believe the Ending IMHO.
","Before people comment 'it's just a movie' listen to my point. What ruined the movie for me is the fact that each fighter in the Championship fight, Tommy and Brenden Conlon, each had three fights prior to the Championship. Tommy never had a fight past 30 seconds never mind going into the second round, Brenden on the other hand goes to the third round and gets pummeled in almost every fight prior to the one against Tommy. Brenden would barely be able to stand let alone win, the Russian literally suplexed Brenden twice, yes WWE style. Other than the ending it was a great film, I just cant get over Tommy losing that fight, it's just not possible, even on film, but what was very realistic were all the gay Marine tribal tattoos Tommy had on his arms.",6,3,6,14 February 2012
