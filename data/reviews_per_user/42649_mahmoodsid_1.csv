Child 44," Tense Drama, 1st time will never bore you.
","Child 44 was a good drama movie, not have too much thrill in it but one who is seeing, will never bore while watching. Movie start was a bit slow, get thriller in the mid but lack sometimes continuity of the main script.Direction: Its an average direction of Daniel Espinosa. Some unexplained scenes make it more weaker. Have mistakes also. Acting: Tom hardy, good at his role, by the way others acting was below average.Overall Movie: A must watch average drama having some crime mystery and a little bit thrill about the life of a disgraced military officer.",6,11,19,13 August 2015
