The New World," Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen
","Where do I begin? It's a bunch of ridiculous scenes that don't link together. The score is overbearing and doesn't match the images. Several very talented actors are wasted with absolute dross for a script. Really, it's laughable. The movie opens with Colin Farrel's character locked up and he nearly gets hanged for insubordination. Next scene he is selected to be the leader of an expedition! Colin gets it on with the cute Indian chick but they don't speak. He has to leave her and when they next meet she speaks perfect English. I think I got about 1/2 an hour into it before I cut my losses. Absolutely tragic.",1,1,6,30 September 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," If this wasn't a movie of a Tolkein book it would have been slated
","As a movie, The Fellowship of the Ring doesn't stand up well on it's own. No matter where the story is originally derived from a movie needs to be structured, make sense and flow in itself whilst, of course, remaining true to the spirit of the original material. And while we're at it, each movie in a trilogy should also be complete in itself. Instead what we have here is a one dimensional storyline, irrelevant scenes and characters, and an ending that isn't. 3 hours is quite a long time to keep an audience entertained and this movie fails in that respect. I'm a fan of the genre and I first read the books 20 years ago but I was bored by this rendition. All in all I won't be rushing out to see the next one.Despite the length of the movie, most of the characters were poorly developed. For instance there was much emphasis on the death of Boromir (played by Sean Bean). But I was thinking that I don't care that he is dying, I don't really know who he is. Who is this Arwen chick (Liv Tyler) and what happened to her? Who is this Legolas guy? We may find out more in the next movie but at the end of this one there are a lot of holes.I spotted a number of references to two of my favourite movies, Highlander (cinematography) and Excalibur (score, battle scenes, wizardry) but this movie doesn't compare well to either of them (except for the special effects we've come to expect from a 100 million dollar movie).  Do yourself a favour and see if you can see those movies on the big screen.I can understand Tolkein nuts would have been hanging out for this movie for decades but I believe that if this wasn't a movie of a classic book then people would have reviewed it much more harshly.Could do better, 6/10.",6,1,3,15 January 2002
Hero," simply stunning
","I saw this movie without seeing any previews or reading any reviews so I had no expectations - but wow what a treat! The story appears to be fairly straightforward - set in China in the 3rd Century BC a nameless warrior (Jet Li) reports to the King of Qin how he has killed three of his most feared and dangerous enemies. But things are not so simple and we are taken on a journey of several versions of events.The cinematography is as good as anything you will see. Stunning landscapes are intertwined with scenes featuring close up slow motion work. The use of colour is spectacular, some scenes having a theme colour which is changed as we move forward. The fight scenes are fantastical with the protagonists gliding through the air swirling swords and spears in their amazing costumes. They've obviously used a large amount of wire work but unlike say The Matrix you are left admiring the grace of the movements rather than being conscious of special effects.The scale is grand, they appear to have used thousands of extras rather than CGI, and the result is impressive. There is some CGI used but it is seamless and complements rather than dominating.The soundtrack is a pleasure to hear. Funky Chinese music with plenty of drums a-banging while swords are a-clanking. And after all the main characters have spent the whole movie trying to kill each other the themes that emerge are love and peace. A nice twist.As you can probably tell I really enjoyed this movie. Possibly not for everyone but worth taking a chance on, you might just love it too.",9,4,8,9 October 2004
