Lucky Number Slevin," Not so brilliant
","It looked good (brilliant set design), the cast was fantastic, but at the end of the day Slevin really doesn't add up to much. It was badly written, predictably plotted and the editing was all over the place- especially the first big scene with Ben Kingsly- thought I was getting sea sick with all the intercutting. You can see why this is out in Europe before it opens in the US- the film company obviously has no confidence in the film. Don't waste your time- rent Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels if you actually want to see a clever gangster film with a 'twist'.Hats off to Lucy Lui though- she was fantastic! I'd like to see her in more roles like this!",1,14,40,22 March 2006
