The New World," Timeless beauty surrounds the most violent change.
","This film proceeds at a pace many viewers would find slow, but I believe the intent behind that pace conveys the AmerIndian mindset of living fully in the present, of small regard for the passage of time. Our present culture, in contrast, focuses heavily upon the immediate future and what is new. We need to adjust our expectations accordingly in order to better appreciate the amazing accomplishment of 'The New World.' This screenplay is more evocative than narrative, which works well in illustrating barriers in language, while the motives, experience and relationships we all hold dear - no matter what our circumstance or culture - shine through. Although the screenplay streamlines the story of Pocahontas, it nevertheless presents a tribute to this remarkable woman. Her life bore tremendous significance at an age in life when many of us haven't yet learned to drive. When I consider Miss Kilcher was only 14 during the filming, her achievement in this role is nothing less than astonishing.Take the time to savor and ponder this film. We're all the better for it.",9,0,1,12 June 2006
Billy Elliot," Jagged As A Chunk Of Coal: No Smooth Edges
","Perhaps you're surprised to see me score this no more than 5 stars. I admit, I came to this film expecting to be wowed. I found it uneven in the extreme.The performances by Jamie Bell (Billy, the kid), Gary Lewis (Jackie, the Dad), and Julie Walters (dance instructor) in acting are very good, and Jamie's dance routine has all the verve and lack of polish one might hope to see in a novice dancer with raw talent.Raw, maybe that's it. The language was hardly what I'd wish to expose my children to, although I understand how a Brit swears better than most Yankees. It was appalling and ubiquitous. The soundtrack nearly drove me away. One must listen closely to the poorly miked dialogue, which is heavily inflected with the Lower Scots influence of the northern coalfields. Suddenly we're nearly blasted out of the room by pop tunes, as thumpy in their delivery as they are redundant in their lyrics.I found myself wondering why the screenplay didn't convey more of the attraction to Billy of the power and beauty of dance. I can think of half a dozen ways that might be accomplished. If I can do that, why not those responsible for producing/writing/directing it?Then there are the blithe bawdiness of 'Debbie,' the repressed daughter of the dance teacher, and the confused and pitiful antics of 'Michael,' 'Billy's' buddy. These blur the focus of the narrative rather than sharpen it. If you haven't yet seen this, be prepared for some shining parts to an otherwise lowbrow approach to the lure and reward of the arts.",5,1,12,27 July 2006
