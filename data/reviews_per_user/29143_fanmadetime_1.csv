The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Such a great movie!
","One of my all time favorite movie. If you read the book you would also love the movie. Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson played the characters very well. I also liked that they really looked for the little things like the songs, how different the other characters were. From the clothes till to the personality. I also really liked how Logan Lerman played Charlie. I think he's a really talented actor and he should play more often in YA-movies (I mean, both Percy Jackson movies were crap, but you have to say he was perfect for the role of Percy) and also Ezra Miller was perfect! He plays a lot LGBT+ roles and he's just brilliant with his work. It's like he was born for the role of Patrick. Also Emma Watson played Sam so good! I have to say, I never thought, that she could play Sam like Stephen Chbosky described her in the book, but when I saw her, it just fit. Loved every second of this movie!",10,0,2,10 May 2016
