The Ring," Saw this movie at the theater when it came out....
","I just rewatched this movie, ready for a big scare!
I was really let down. What the heck did I think was so scary??? A little creepiness at the end, but that is all.
Question, why did the lady not just walk away from the horse when it was acting crazy?
What she thought she was a horse whisperer??
That was stupid.",5,0,1,22 November 2019
Wind River," A wonderful surprise
","I went into the movie not knowing what to expect, kind of a slow start, but about 40 mins into it I found myself really attached to the story and emotionally involved, not able to turn away. Great storyline, original, entertaining thriller. I would definitely recommend this movie.",9,0,0,29 April 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," have i seen this before?
","Real quick, can there be a star wars movie about something other than the creating of a death star, coming under the attack of a death star or destroying a death star? like in this entire made up universe this is the one component that star wars decides to include in almost every movie? its like watching taken 2-8, its the same movie except different characters. lets get creative star wars, lose the death star for a movie.",6,1,1,13 January 2018
The Irishman," If I could give it 11/10 I would
",I absolutely loved everything about this movie. The cast has all my favorite Italian actors. The story of Hoffa was told in such a way that I didn't want it to stop. It is a instant classic.,10,7,14,1 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I was actually into this one... until the end
","Starwars has relied on its fan base for a long time and has become extremely lazy in creativity. How many movies do you have to make with the Death Star in it?!??! Like come on. There's nothing else??? So boring. This time around, no Death Star!!!! Awesome! Buuuut we get a weird love story of distant cousins. The weakness of the 'bad' characters in Star Wars is that they always have emotion towards their long lost family members, boooooooo. If they are evil, let them be evil!!! Then Rey kills the almighty Sith Lord???? Come on. Such garbage. Too predictable. The only solution is to have Christopher Nolan do a 'dark' character like darth maul, that's what would be amazing.",6,0,4,3 June 2020
Bird Box," It started off so good
","I loved this movie from the beginning. Great story, wonderful suspense, the visuals were gorgeous. Yet, 2/3 into the movie it all of a sudden became stale, I lost interest. It really sucks too, because there was so much potential. There's some things that never were explained, and the ending could of been better. It's all about the ending, this one was just mediocre.",6,1,4,23 December 2018
Collateral," Why ruin a movie with such a bad ending?!?
","I loved everything about this movie in the beginning, great story line, wonderful characters, buuuut, once again Hollywood has to make Jaime fox a immortal character, he just can't be a #2 in a movie his ego won't allow him to be, he has to be the hero. So in this movie a taxi cab driver (mr.fox) out shoots, and kills a trained hit man (cruise)... come on... such garbage",6,2,4,20 September 2019
Quantum of Solace," what did i just watch?
","Seen this movie (4) times, still dont know what its about. Casino royale was better.",4,0,3,24 December 2017
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," if its not broken dont fix it
","We are back at it folks, if you saw my jurassic park / batman review you know this wont be pretty. The ring series was amazing, so cool, so real, i loved that they used live actors as much as possible. Yet mr Jackson must of felt some pressure from the higher ups because i think sharknado has better graphics. I honestly lost interest in this series when i saw how bad the graphics were, this series was waaaaaaaay too rushed. The graphics on game of thrones looks 10x better. very cheesy and very disappointing.",5,0,1,24 December 2017
Drive," If you like this movie you suck at picking movies
","Ryan is perhaps the worst actor ever in the history of acting. There's scenes where he's just awkwardly silent and he and the costar just stare at each other for 30 seconds. Nothing amazing here, nothing even entertaining. Save yourself the time, watch Jurassic world. Jkjk don't watch either.",4,5,10,28 March 2019
The Lion King," Timon and pumbaa were amazing..
","Let's just put this out there for all to see, the graphics were absolutely unbelievable, you gotta see it in imax. Timon and pumba definitely stole the show. But, that's where the positive feed back ends. Scar's voice was horrible, not close to being the evil character he should of been. There was also time when the voice was off from the mouth moving. Overall it was NOT better than original, but definitely worth watching once.",6,0,1,23 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Orginal storyline
","Its another monster movie, but with a twist. I like the dynamic this movie adds that goes hand and hand with the monsters weakness (without giving too much away). What I don't understand is how this movie got a 8/10?!? its cool, entertaining and suspenseful, but at the same time its nothing ground breaking. Again, not to give too much away, but how one of the main characters dies in the film left me scratching my head, there was other options in that scenario. Also the ending was just bridged together kind of quickly, it didn't flow organically.",6,3,4,6 June 2018
Jurassic World," if its not broken dont fix it part deux
","Btw, every person reviewing this movie should be mind blown that the imbd staff rated this movie a 7.2. Please tell me i'm not the only person that thinks they are getting checks from chris pratt himself. i mean only 48 staff members voted, either they are getting paid to raise this rating or i should be a staff member because there's a large group of people that suck at their job.",2,1,2,24 December 2017
Jurassic World," cheesy dino movie
","Its like the old saying goes. If its not broken don't fix it. Nothing will ever beat the original. They need to leave this franchise alone. The entire story line of Owen (chris Pratt) being some kind of velociraptor whisperer is so cheesy. They are trying to make the velociraptor into some kind of pet dog you can train. Who ever is Chris Pratts manager should get paid almost as much as him, because all i see when i look at him is the goofy guy from parks and rec, not a dino trainer, how he got this gig blows my mind, congrats.",2,0,1,24 December 2017
The Dark Knight," amazing all around movie
","Doesn't matter if your a batman fan or not. This movie has everything, action, story, great characters and acting. Ben affleck stay away. leave this series alone",10,0,0,24 December 2017
Sicario," im at a loss for words...
","Again, who are the people reviewing these movies? this is a solid flick. great action, very intense, and you cant help but respect the people who really fight this kind of crime on a day to day basis. I cant wait for the 2nd one coming out. 7.6? jurassic park is at 7.2?!? this is deff a 8-9 movie. watch it, thank me later.",10,1,2,24 December 2017
The Descent," Easy does it on the high rating for this movie
","This movie is slow in the beginning, there's definitely some cheesy parts leading up to the action. There's a handful of parts that catch you off guard, but the whole package of the movie is nothing off the charts that deserve anything higher than a 6, and it's only that high because it's not a storyline you see all the time.",6,6,11,15 March 2019
Zero Dark Thirty," Super interesting and in-depth story of finding bin laden
","I am a huge history fan. This movie was very interesting since it is based on true events. So cool to see the events leading up to finding / getting bin laden. Love to see James gandolfini in a movie as well. Side note, I would of gave this movie a 8 if Chris Pratt wasn't in it.",7,0,0,1 July 2020
It Chapter Two," I'll tell you the truth when others won't
","The movie series had me so excited for the sequel, I thought the first movie had some moments that definitely made me jump. I wish this movie had more creepy / scary moments. I would give it a 1/10 for scare. This movie really goes in depth and gives a back story for all the characters, which is cool, they even touch on the clowns past, which I wish they would have spent more time on. At times this movie was cheesy and really dragged on. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",2,17,29,8 September 2019
The Big Short," awesome movie!
","Not only is this movie informative, it is super interesting. If you haven't, i recommend reading rich dad poor dad, has some similar undertones - homes should be viewed as a liability not a asset. As Americans we need to educate ourselves. Its a eye opener that had me watching closely the entire time. The cast is amazing as well. watch it, you'll thank me.",8,1,1,24 December 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," if its not broken dont fix it
","If you saw my jurassic park review you know where this one is headed. Sorry Ben, step away from the mask and cape, leave it to Mr. Bale. Ben is not a good batman at all and the direction he took him is horrible. There are blatant rip offs of the dark knight, like the bat mobile, very unoriginal. stick to the dark knight series folks.",4,0,5,24 December 2017
Space Jam," MJ over lebron anyday
","This movie stars the real goat (mj). Part 1 shows MJ defeating the monstars, part 2 has lebron (just like in real life) missing free throws in the final seconds losing to the monstars and forever living in the GOAT's shadow. The end.",8,1,2,19 November 2019
Green Book," Absolutely love this movie
","Being a fellow Italian, whenever anything with a lot of heritage is made it catches my attention. From the start of the movie I fell in love with the characters, the story is something I've never seen before. I highly recommend anyone and everyone to watch it.",8,1,3,7 September 2019
Donnie Darko," An 8??? This movie isn't a 5 on its wedding day
",Not creepy or scary at all. A big let down. I would not recommend to anyone.,5,2,11,11 November 2019
Sully," I got goosebumps
","Sully was absolutely amazing in his decision making that saved hundreds. Also Tom Hanks is on my top 6 of celebrities I want to be friends with, so this movie is a win / win. Great all around movie, it had you on the edge of your seat, as well as yelling at the board members for being D bags for even suggesting Sully made a bad call in this situation.",8,0,0,11 December 2019
Law Abiding Citizen," Literally a perfect movie.... until the end
","This movie had everything I love in a movie, suspense, cleverness, action, great actors, the bad guy is winning.... until the end, the end ruins the movie for me, they really should change it, come on! A lawyer out wit a mastermind!?!? Booooo",6,1,1,19 September 2019
