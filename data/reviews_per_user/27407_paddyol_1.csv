The Longest Yard," Longest Yard v Mean Machine v Longest Yard
","A remake of a remake without too many new gags. The movie is light (Helium is closer) and has some funny moments. The Original (starring Burt Reynolds 1974) was first remade as 'Mean Machine' and starred Vinnie Jones, and a lot of the jokes from both those movies are in this one.Don't go looking for another 'Shawshank Redemption' this is not a serious prison movie but a light hearted slapstick semi movie semi underdog story that should be enjoyed and forgotten.Not as funny the second time around.Worth a 5 as I got some laughs and for all the Pro Wrestlers it employed.PaddyO",5,2,4,13 April 2006
