Skyfall," Absolutely Brilliant.
","James Bond celebrates his anniversary in possibly the best fashion imaginable. Everything from the story, the acting and the action scenes were just superb, and the time flew by when watching it.First of all, the story. Since it's the first Bond film not to be based on a novel, it gave the series a chance to change its style, and this story definitely shows this. The days of crazed billionaires taking over the world with nuclear weaponry is gone. The film is based on a psychopath looking for revenge. No complex story, no bundles of characters chucked at us, just simple revenge. And it works oh so well.Secondly, the acting. Thesis probably Daniel Craig's finest performance as 007, and almost makes 'Casino Royale' a distant memory. In my opinion, he's still second best to Sean Connery, but all that I'm sure will change shortly. The other M16 characters also play their part. Judi Dench's performance was brilliant and passionate, and newcomers Ralph Feinnes, Naiome Harris and Ben Whishaw in particular were equally superb. And Javier Bardem? One of the best Bond villains ever, and he gives a performance almost reminiscent of Heath Ledger in 'The Dark Knight'. It was a joy to watch him play Silva.Finally, the action scenes. Everything from the opening scene to the subway to the end was all so smoothly put together, it was a great thrill ride.Oh, and the theme song? Best ever.Overall: 10/10, best Bond to date, go and watch it.",10,8,25,26 October 2012
Ted," Seth McFarlane is officially a comedy genius.
","For the last few years, Seth McFarlane has graced television screens with 'Family Guy' and 'American Dad'. Two animated comedy shows that leave me laughing for 23 minutes straight with its new idea of wit, one-liners and hilarious cutaways which brilliantly reference other TV shows and movies.So when I saw 'Ted', I had seen all the trailers and was absolutely buzzing, particularly with the all-star cast, which includes McFarlane. After laughing so hard for the next 106 minutes, it officially ranks as one of the funniest movies i have ever seen, and officially makes McFarlane a genius.First thing that makes it great: The cast. I said it's an all-star line-up, but the cast are just so good. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis have such good chemistry on set and looked a perfect match. McFarlane lent his terrific voice acting skills to the role of Ted, and, despite sounding a lot like Peter Griffin (which, for the record, I have no objection to), he was probably the only person who could ever make the character come alive. And his relationship with John (Wahlberg's character) is absolutely brilliant, even though it has absolutely no right to be. The supporting actors were great as well. Patrick Stewart was probably the only person who McFarlane would ever have considered giving the role of the narrator to, and his voice really adds something to the movie. I also loved the jobs Patrick Warburton and Giovanni Ribisi did, and Sam Jones as himself was just too funny!Second thing that makes it great: It's the McFarlane Formula. He took what he mainly does on 'Family Guy' and made it into a feature-length movie. I have no idea how he makes it work, it has no right to work, but goddammit it works!! The scene where Lori asks John what he thinks his dance moves were like when they first met, the way he spoofs the infamous 'Saturday Night Fever' scene, despite the fact it's already been done in movies such as 'Airplane!', had me in hysterics for the whole thing. It was just perfect. It's weird because quite a few of his jokes centre around pop culture, and when the god awful movies of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are released containing these jokes, they're always slated (but for good reason, they are dreadful). I guess McFarlane knows how to get things right, not make jokes drag out too much or make them repeating themselves, and the timing is key, which he always gets right.So yeah, this movie flat out rocks, and, unless your sensitive to very vulgar language and terrorist and racist jokes, drag yourself down to the nearest theatre and watch this movie!! :)",10,2,10,24 August 2012
Pan's Labyrinth," Seriously, THIS is a cult movie??
","I watched this movie because of the reviews it has, claiming it is a fantasy masterpiece. As I was watching it, all I was thinking was 'What is this??'For a film known for its fantasy, there is hardly any fantasy value in it. There are 2 or 3 scenes with the fantasy value, and even then they're ridiculous and have no connection to a war film. The 'amazing fantasy creatures' are:1) That annoying faun. 2) Those small fairy insects in a box. 3) A giant toad (I know, real imaginative!) 4) That small screeching thing that lives in milk... 5) Something with eyes in its hands that walks in the most ridiculous manner possible. That's it.And other than these cheap excuses for fantasy what is there? Oh yeah, there's a Spanish person who mindlessly kills all the other characters in the movie. And there isn't even a sustainable storyline. If you've heard this movie is good PLEASE ignore those reviews and keep away from this movie!",1,14,32,8 June 2012
