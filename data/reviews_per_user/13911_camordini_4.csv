The Avengers," Good but not as clever as the single hero pre-quels
","I don't think I need to re-hash the plot details with 1000 reviews before me. In short, the Avengers come together, at first they don't like each other, but they band together to save the world from aliens. The technical gadgets and space craft were cool and looked great on the big screen. However, with so many main characters and so much action to fit in, the funny, quirky, bits about each character were lost. Everyone got in a one liner, but not much more than that. I missed the heart pounding heavy metal arrogance of Iron Man, the fish out of water grandeur of Thor and even the mysterious plot line of Captain America. With all the fab reviews, I must just have different taste in movies. I felt less endless battles and more banter and purpose would have jazzed this up a bit. I only bother to write review 1000 and something hoping that Joss picks up on this and makes the next Avengers a bit more clever.",7,1,3,2 June 2013
Burn After Reading," Too cool to bother with character or plot
","Just because you are the Cohen brothers does not mean you can pump out any old stuff and call it art, or entertainment. They had two fun ideas, lets get really fabulous actors to play middle age losers and wouldn't it be funny if these jokers found something they thought was valuable CIA information, but it really wasn't. The only other plot element was that everyone was sleeping with everyone else. Really?! Someone could have taken these elements and written a good script and done a decent movie, but the Cohen brothers didn't bother with those steps. There really is nothing more to the movie. None of the characters have any back-story or depth, so you couldn't really care less what happens to them. The dialog is generic and vague. For example, Frances McDormand's character wants money for some 'operations'. We presume they are for some sort of plastic surgery, but throughout the movie she just says 'I really need these operations'. It's as if the writers put in a filler phrase and never took the time to go back and flesh it out. It is almost painful to watch her deliver these lame lines.Having said that- the stellar cast lived up to their talents. Once lured into this fiasco, they each put their best into it and carried off the one dimensional, irritating characters with as much talent and finesse as was humanly possible.Complete waste of time to watch, despite the great stars.",3,0,3,15 April 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Deeper into the Rabbit Hole
","Catching Fire, Part 2 of a trilogy, captured the gritty realness of the first movie, while dropping the shaky cam and adding a bit more Hollywood drama and scale. I was afraid the new director would turn it into an action hero, dystopian adventure film and was relieved by his restraint and loyalty to the themes of the books. While the plot eventually brings our heroine to The Arena again, this is in no way a repeat of the first Games. In #1 the question is, what would you do to survive? In #2 the question is, who is the real enemy? This series is thoughtful, asking the viewer/reader to consider what they would do in a similar situation and hoping you leave with the suspicion that you ARE in a similar situation. If you just want action adventure, you will be much happier with the Avengers etc. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job, as usual, showing us exactly what Katniss is thinking and feeling just with a look. Everyone else lives up to their previous performances with Elizabeth Banks' portrayal of Effie's growing compassion a particular standout. I am a big believer in comic relief and we have become very accustomed to movies where violence and humor are played off each other. This is not one of those movies. There is precious little comic relief, as I don't think Suzanne Collins (the author of the books) found her topic particularly funny. Still, this is one area I think the script writers could embellish a bit to help the flow of the movie.",8,1,15,21 March 2014
The Martian," Enjoyed the scenery, but didn't meet any new friends
","We enjoyed this trip to Mars and hanging out with some folks in the space station, but we really didn't get to know anyone well enough to say it was a great time, or to want to go back and watch it again. This is the primary problem with the Maritan- it is 95% plot with just a nod to character development. We all know that most story lines are recycled, and the Maritan is your classic stranded on a desert island scenario. What makes each story different is who is in this situation and how they respond. Unfortunately the Martian just doesn't reveal the background, thoughts, motivations or emotions of the characters. The sparse dialogue is utterly expected- the least you could say to move the plot along. And for a movie that depends so much on plot, the final solution to the big problem has been done before, even recently. I won't say where- no spoilers from me, but really, was not surprised by it.There were touches that I enjoyed. The theme of the rule breaking maverick saving the day, or causing the trouble was avoided. Scientists of all sorts were portrayed in their most interesting and exciting light. And I liked that the movie reminded us that space is still worth exploring, lets get our act together and keep being the pioneers that humans are born to be.I probably would have give this a 7 instead of 6, except as an Oscar nominee, I am holding it to a slightly higher standard. By all means, watch the movie, enjoy the movie, but there are a lot of elements missing for a truly great movie.",6,1,1,27 February 2016
