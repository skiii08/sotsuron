Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," George Lucas forgot what made the original movie great
","As we look back at the movie triumph that was Star Wars: A New Hope, many of us may be inclined to embrace the special effects or witty dialogue as the hallmarks of the movie. Yet these are not what made Star Wars a classic.The reason Star Wars has been held in reverence by the generation that grew up on it has been for one reason: we wish dearly to become Jedi Knights. The fantasy/science fiction blend brought together the most fundamental elements that made its heroes our role models.In The Phantom Menace, George Lucas has forgotten this reason for his success. In no way, after watching the movie, do I want to be in Qui-gon or Obi-wan's place alongside Jar Jar Binks or any number of the other insipid 'fantasy' characters created to please the juvenile audience. The only redeeming portion of the film is the final sword-fight -- if not for its action then for its high drama and suspense. But a few minutes of excellent fantasy will not make up for the childish and recycled story preceding them.Finally, let it be said that the pod-racing scene was drawn out beyond all purpose. For these reasons, I give The Phantom Menace a heart-felt '2' rating, and have already sworn off watching the second installment.",2,0,1,16 February 2000
