Lucy (Drew Barrymore) suffers from short term memory loss due to a car accident on her father's birthday. every day, she wakes up thinking that it's her father's birthday. Henry (Adam Sandler) is a local marine biologist who is afraid of commitment, so he has sex with tourists, then they go back to the mainland the next day. they meet, henry falls in love with lucy, then the next day she doesn't remember him. Sue (the owner of the restaurant where they meet, and lucy's friend) tells him about lucy's problem. henry is determined to get lucy to fall in love with him every day.i love Ula, henry's local friend. he's really funny. I also love Mr. Tattoo Face ( i forgot his real name, but thats what henry calls him. henry is Mr Peana Butta Cups). Also, i was wondering, is Alexa a guy or a girl? i couldn't really tell.7.5/10",Null,0,0,12 July 2004
