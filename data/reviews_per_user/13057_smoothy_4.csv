The Blair Witch Project," Fear? What fear?
","Not since The Exorcist have I ever been soooo bored during the film.  This film wasn't scary at all (except for the last 2 minutes in the house).  It didn't get me thinking at all.  All I could ever think about was whether my girlfriend would get bored quicker than I would.  This is one of a long line of films that doesn't live up to the hype.  If you are a typically paranoid person or have some kind of similar ailment then, yes, this film may scare you out of your wits, but most normal people wouldn't find this one bit scary.  I don't usually watch horror movies and am not a big fan of them but even Scream 2 made me jump out of my seat and that is a pretty cheesey movie by all accounts.  The one thing you could marvel at in this movie is how they shot it, I mean, talk about original!!  The way it was made drops one on every other big budget film from a great height.  Ingenious.  Otherwise a really boring bland film.",4,0,2,31 October 1999
Blade," One stupendous film!!
","This film is the tops!!  I went to go and see it and I couldn't believe my eyes!!  One of the best action sequences goes on in the first 10 minutes, and has to be seen to be believed.  Great choice of actor to play Blade, Wesley Snipes does Blade justice.  I'm off to watch it once again, and I can't wait for Blade 2!!",10,0,1,17 November 1998
Sleepy Hollow," An absolutely brilliant film
","Love this film, it's the best out there among the dross that is out at the moment in the UK.  It's not really a typical horror and not even supposed to be a comedy (although there are a bit too many laughs than normal) but it has a great plot that is played excellently.  Christopher Walken is excellent as the Headless Horseman, once again showing that he is one of a few band of actors that can play bad guys really convincingly.  Overall, a film that has to be watched!!",8,0,0,9 February 2000
The Exorcist," Sick, but not scary...
","After all the hype, all the newspaper comments on the film 'This film has been banned for at least 10 years', 'Sick', 'Scary', even 'The Best movie ever made', 'Audiences were vomiting after the film'I had to go and see it. And I was disappointed.  A bit.  It's very good, but not scary at all.  Sick in places, but not scary.  The first half of the film is incredibly boring, only picking up in the last third.  If you don't believe me, then note this point, throughout the film, the audience were laughing at key points. Laughing?!?!  That says it all!!",7,0,1,5 November 1998
