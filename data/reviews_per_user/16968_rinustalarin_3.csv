The New World," A total disappointment despite the outstanding cast
","When i've seen the advertisement of this movie i was so thrilled to see it. What to say the cast and the title was tempting.Cast being one of the best of its time. But having this terrific actors and actresses, have turned the movie into a disaster.I will try to explain what i disliked and what i liked about this movie Dislikes: Nearly everything except for the cast members.The music itself was not even a music it would be so 'cool' if there was none because for 90% of the film the same track was repeating itself from different 'locations' of itself.The technical details in the movie: or lets say the empty parts or the parts where you say: ''hey what just happened? they were not... come on this is ridiculous''... there were a lot of them. The connection between scenes were so weak that sometimes i've felt like i was watching 2 or 3 different movies at a time.The story and directing: i have only one thing to ask; 'What were you thinking?' the scripts were unbelievably lame, the story and how it develops is a total disaster.Likes: The cast members: It is very rare to find such a great cast -honestly-. and every one of them made me believe who they were despite the fact that the whole concept of the movie is a total failure.To sum; The very reason i wanted to get out of the cinema in the break(for the first time in my 23 years of life) was that i couldn't resist to see the effort of the cast members in the failing concept of the camera angles, the 'speech and playback technique', (i didn't want to write a spoiler so you'll understand what i'm saying by this when you see the movie) the non existence of thrill and logic and so on..I would have never given 5 out of 10 if the cast was this perfect but this 'flawlessness' in actor and actress choice made the movie a disaster. Because when you look at the billboard you expect something extraordinary and stunning, which this movie is not even close to ordinary.But really watch this movie. I would really recommend this to everyone if you want to see the transformation of a gold in to a golden brown painted plastic.Regards",5,1,3,13 February 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," best bridge from 'Fantasy' to 'Reality' ever made
","This is a film i will never forget...This is a fantasy i can never feel for a long time...This is a reality i will always be living in it! When i have watched this on the cinema and have noticed the director of it, to be honest, i had no expectations since my experience with Hellboy was extremely unpleasant. But after seeing this artwork... My apologies Del Torro. Excellent job.This was the first thing that made me question if the fairy tales are true or they are just our imagination. This is the whole concept of the film. You are sure that the fantasy part exist but also you are sure that it is reality. So it is completely up to your imagination.The fantasy characters starting with Pan himself were unimaginable. Especially another evil character (for the ones who haven't seen the film i will not mention the specs. :) I couldn't believe my eyes that some human from this world could imagine to create a character like that.Other than that, including our young starring actress, there were no doubt that none of the performances were below 'awesome'.So watch this film, because it's worth watching. Did i also mention how beautiful the music was? Or the storyline? or, briefly 'everything' Very good job Del Torro. I wish more quality works to come Regards",10,1,10,7 March 2010
Iron Man," The story... not the original one: the characters and acting...terrific!
",I have seen the movie a couple of times to find moments if any of the actors 'acted'(other than being the character they should be) in the movie and i couldn't find a mini second of failure. Especially Downey... outstanding performance for this kind of movie.When you look at other super hero movies the starring actor or actress generally cannot reflect the character they should be which is -i think- a huge failure of the director.Downey here portraits who Tony Stark is. I have to admit that the story is not even close to the original story but it is a fine adjustment in todays political and military issues. and also Tony Stark character is almost recreated in the movie.The supporting characters were also well chosen starting with Stane(Bridges) and Rhodey(Howard) and continues with Pepper Potts (Paltrow).The visual effects of the movie...It was also another thing that stunned me. I was almost gonna believe that they've really built the suit!I highly recommend to everyone who is considering watching it.,9,2,4,13 February 2010
