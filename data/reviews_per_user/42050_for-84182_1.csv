10 Cloverfield Lane," What??
","10 Cloverfield Lane had a nice idea for a story line, however the 'alien' thing was terrible. It was so slow throughout the film that my partner and I were falling asleep at points in the film, then at the end suddenly it goes from mystery/thriller/suspense to an alien horror. All I can say is.. what on earth were the writers thinking? Choose a genre and story line, and please stick to it instead of that bull. I understand he mentioned things about aliens, however up until the moment she left the shelter all evidence was pointing to him making the scenario up and being delusional. It was all over the place. Another thing is my partner and I were losing our minds over the fact she was so loud. I swear she wanted to die, instead of quietly and quickly getting away, she was admiring the birds and clashing into every little thing. Yes, she was nervous. Yes she had realized there was no disease. But she was disregarding the danger coming after her. Furthermore, what happened to Megan and Brittany? We can only assume that they were killed, but it was never confirmed. It was as though her entire existence was disregarded and leaves me wondering exactly what happened. I could go on further, but I think it would be easier to say this film has major flaws that could be improved on. Three stars for acting, but that's all.",3,11,20,29 May 2016
