Marie Antoinette," I Want Candy
","Energetic', 'Bright', and 'Lively' are adjectives which best describe Sofia Coppola's film, MARIE ANTOIENETTE. Many historical films are pedantic in that they seem to labor in an attempt to accentuate the difference between a certain historical period and how it contrasts the present. This film is very impressionistic in that Marie's perspective is almost that of a modern teenage girl. She is portrayed as a kind hearted soul who is thrust into an arranged marriage designed only to strengthen relations between two super-powers. Her personal feelings are not even addressed, and much to her dismay, the marriage is not consummated for over seven years. Her attempts to adapt are rebuffed, so she employs the flamboyant and eccentric court life of Versailles as a distraction. The political drama and intrigue of the French monarchy is infused with the whimsy of youth as Marie tries to find her place. The screen is drenched in pastels and scenes sprout inexplicably like an MTV video while the soundtrack blasts the songs of 1980's New Romantics. This music, although wildly out of historical context, embraces the spirit of a young girl who is trying to have the best possible time in troubling circumstances. Whether or not this is an historical accurate picture of the real Marie Antoinette (which is really beside the point), Sofia Coppola's characterization beautifully encapsulates the lightheartedness of a young female in a daunting situation.",8,0,2,20 April 2009
Pirate Radio," Hippy Hippy Shake
","If you are a fan of popular music, or even contemporary pop culture, PIRATE RADIO is A Must See. It is absolutely shocking that corporate radio in The United Kingdom devoted less than an hour a day to Rock music during the 60's. And, this idiotic blunder forced lover's of the music to take matters into their own hands--Broadcast The People's Music from offshore so that the staid and conventional arbitrators of Taste and Morality could not touch them. Bill Nighy, appears as the boss of the pirate radio station, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, plays one of the motley collection of DJs who broadcast the Love of Rock from the isolation of the North Sea. We watch as the British establishment (the foremost official played by Kenneth Branagh sporting a mustache and glasses which render him almost unrecognizable) are completely blindsided as creative and innovative English musicians capitalized on the nascent American music scene, and create an entirely new and vibrant musical aesthetic. After The Pretty Things and The Rolling Stones, Elvis's quaint Hip Shake, and the straight-laced Hootenany scene were recast as mere footnotes in the history of contemporary music. It could be argued that the British musical and cultural invasion of the 60's was that nation's biggest sociological influence of all time. However, I have one fairly serious criticism with PIRATE RADIO. Although the film is an amazing musical compilation of sixties English music, it is mystifying and inexplicable as to why they chose to overlook the music of The Beatles? Regardless of the cost, it needed to be there. It's like an examination of Christianity without Jesus.",9,2,3,16 July 2010
Velvet Goldmine," Glam Minus Bowie?
","VELVET GOLDMINE does a superb job in capturing the essence of The Glam Rock Period. The music of Roxy Music, Slade, T-Rex, The Stooges, and many more showcase the anarchism of that fantastic scene. However, the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room is completely ignored! I think it would be hilarious and exceedingly interesting if David Bowie contributed a commentary track. Although you could make the case that Glam Rock would have occurred without Bowie, and this film certainly makes the case, his direction and artistic vision had an imprint on nearly every aspect of the genre. It would almost be like presenting the victory of The American North in the Civil War without mentioning Abraham Lincoln. VELVET GOLDMINE is a wonderful, fabulous vision of a sexually confusing and nihilistic social movement which enjoyed surprising mainstream success. This film does almost everything to explain the mystery and power of this fleeting musical fad and stylistic fashion by employing a curious metaphorical technique.",8,1,1,13 February 2009
8 Mile," Fight The Power
","In another era of American film, James Stewart might have been cast to star in this film. Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith Jr. (played by rapper, Eminem) is cast as a classic under-dog who overcomes incredible odds to achieve his dream. In one of James Stewart's most memorable roles, he portrayed a character who faced up to impossible odds, and vindicated himself from a political corruption debacle on the floor of the United States Senate. In 8 MILE, down-and-out White rapper, 'Rabbit' Smith, in a stunning upset, wins over a skeptical audience, and triumphs as a major player on the city's musical scene. And, in an ironic use of Race, the fact that he is a White Man, in nearly all-Black Detroit, Michigan, only plays as one more strike against him. 8 MILE also boasts a great supporting cast, and Marshall Mathers (Eminem) has a very engaging Screen Presence.",8,1,1,28 March 2011
Drag Me to Hell," Leave My Kitten Alone
","DRAG ME TO HELL is a salute to the Classic 'B' Horror format of the late 1950's. Sam Raimi has created a film which implores you to have fun with the absurd plot twists which inexorably race toward a dire conclusion. The viewer is frantically plunged into the world of a young bank officer, played by Alison Lohman, who has incurred the wrath of a wizened gypsy crone with satanic powers, and if she doesn't act quickly, her immortal soul is toast. You find yourself anxiously imploring the protagonist to follow your directions, not based so much on what you are watching, but based on your knowledge of the genre. We all know some of the Cardinal Rules of 'B' Movie Horror; Never assume it's just the wind, Be very aware of the sinister background music, Never utter the phrase, 'I'll be right back', Don't go into the basement, and most important, Never decline to obey a baleful gypsy sorceress !!! If you liked the greats of kitschy horror such as, THE TINGLER, THE BLOB, SCREAMING SKULL, and TERROR FROM THE YEAR 5000, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy this film.",Null,0,3,3 December 2009
Mama," Janie's Got A Gun
","MAMA (dir. Andres Muschietti) This movie is an unparalleled, super- terrific 'thrill ride' of a ghost film. It's executive producer is horror master Guillermo del Toro, and the film provides a maximum of mind blowing excitement and terrifying images that are solidly backed by an unforgettable storyline. After a mysterious shooting, two very young sisters are abandoned in a creepy cabin deep in the forest and raised by a ghost who they refer to as 'mama'. For nearly five years their uncle and his rock-chick girlfriend have been unsuccessfully trying to locate them. Finally the girls are rescued, and brought back to suburbia to reclaim their shot at a comfortable middle-class life. But these two siblings are very rough around the psychic edges, and unearthly mischief and mayhem sticks to them like paranormal ectoplasm.The film's superior production team employs unbelievable dream sequences and computer generated special effects to propel the story that were widely popularized by Japanese and Korean filmmakers such as Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Takashi Miike, Bong Joon-ho, and Kim Ji-woon during the 90's. However, in no way is the film an homage, but MAMA is a brilliant standout in the Horror Genre, and very much a MUST SEE.",8,1,2,12 July 2013
