First Man," Slow, melancholy, boring
","My son and I both almost fell asleep in this movie.While the film is technically superb, visually stunning, and artfully portrayed, it's just so SLOW. The tone is very melancholy. At the end everyone just kind of walked out of the theater with their heads down. It was a depressing experience.I really expected First Man to be something in the realm of Apollo 13 (1995), but I was wrong. Since I am fascinated by history and my favorite types of movies are those based on true stories, I had to see this. But it was a missed opportunity. The director really blew it., since he could have made it an interesting, up-tempo, high-spirited movie. Instead he made it the opposite of all those things.",6,40,70,12 October 2018
Apollo 13," Much better than First Man
","After watching the incredibly slow and boring First Man (2018), I was reminded what a fantastic movie Apollo 13 is. It's better to watch this movie again for the third or fourth time rather than watch First Man even once.",10,8,14,12 October 2018
