The Devil's Advocate," Great Pacino vehicle...
","This film will appeal to Al Pacino fans (who gives a truly fiery performance), and to those who believe in and/or just interested in the xtian mythology (some of the latter crowd may find the film a bit disturbing, however).  Perhaps unfortunately, the film is entirely lacking in suspense, since we know Pacino's the devil from the beginning... everything draws to a very inevitable conclusion.One thing I didn't find very believable is Keanu Reeve's characters' final action (I won't give it away in case you haven't seen the film).  The guy plays an incredibly self-centered, egomaniacal sort of person, so what he does is pretty unbelievable and out of character... it seems much more likely he'd go ahead and 'strike a bargain,' so to speak, given his actions & motivations up until nearly the last moments of the film.Just a final observation... I've seen Keanu Reeves playing characters both dead and alive, and amazingly he doesn't look any different 'playing dead' than he does 'playing alive.'  Sometimes I wonder if Reeves is actually neither dead nor alive... is there something in between?  Maybe Hollywood knows something we don't, putting him in films like this one and 'Dracula.' 
7/10 for entertainment value, and another opportunity to watch Al Pacino ranting and raving...",7,1,2,22 March 2002
The Blair Witch Project," Unimaginably boring, dull and imbecilic...
","Let me make myself perfectly clear from the start:  I went into this movie with *NO* expectations whatsoever.  I had no exposure at all to the hype. My younger brother told me how terrible this movie was, but I thought it must have *some* redeeming value -- in fact, it sounded interesting.  After seeing it, I realized that it had no redeeming value.  It was bad, bad, bad. Dull.  The fact that I made it all the way through without turning it off is a minor miracle.Another thing -- I'm not at all lacking in imagination.  I love atmospheric films.  I've felt a creepy sensation being in the woods before (although I usually just feel peaceful) and was terrified of the dark as a child (I got over it!)  But the fact is, this movie had no atmosphere.  It had no acting (though plenty of ridiculous overacting).  It had no plot.  It had no cinematography.  No directing.In fact, this wasn't a movie at all.  I don't know what it was... I don't...I know... it had to be a farce!  I get it now... someone posted several hundred positive reviews using different names on the IMDB, trying to get people to watch it.  Must have been whoever released the film.  The production company must have been in on it.Honest... how else to explain why ANYONE would consider this dull, meaningless piece of junk?  I feel very cheated that I wasted the money to rent this on DVD.  I would feel cheated if someone offered (and paid) me fifty dollars to see it again.The only film of ANY genre I've seen that was worse was 'The Telephone' (Whoopi Goldberg).  This film goes down as #2 on the bottom 10 films I've ever seen.Long after the release of this piece of trash, I remain utterly baffled that anyone with an IQ over 25 (or under 25, for that matter) would see any redeeming value in this film.  And I will probably always be baffled.Rating: 1/10",1,12,22,29 January 2001
The Blair Witch Project," Beavis, Butthead and Daria Do the Woods
","Give me $500 and I'll buy a cheap video camera, get together a few friends, and do this film ten times better, cheaper and faster.  One of the most boring pieces of tripe I've ever seen.  Rotten acting, screenwriting, zero suspense and no horror combine to rate this 1/10 stars.  Too bad they don't have a zero star rating here, because if they did I'd wish they had a -1 star rating.",1,2,3,30 November 1999
Scarface," Gripping and intense...
","A slick, polished, extremely professional and intense depiction of one of the most ruthless gangsters ever depicted on film, the Cuban cocaine dealer 'Tony Montana' (played by Al Pacino), also known as 'Scarface.'  Running long (but never boring) at 2:50, the high production values of this film really make it stand out.  Every penny put into this movie is evident on screen.  Oliver Stone's screenplay is first-rate, and this is some of Al Pacino's best acting.  Michelle Pfeiffer puts in an outstanding performance as well as 'Elvira Hancock,' Tony Montana's wife.  I can't pinpoint a single actor in this movie who gets it wrong.  Brian De Palma's directing is superb throughout the film.It should be pointed out that there are scenes in this movie absolutely not suitable for younger viewers.  Even accompanied by a parent, I would not bring along your 12-year-old to see this picture.  The violence is so intense at some points that it's a miracle the picture escaped the 'NC-17' rating.  Actual sexual content is minimal.  This is one of the most violent pictures I've ever seen, perhaps THE most violent.Despite this, 'Scarface' is an absolute must-see.  You will be drawn into the story so fast and deep, you had better not drink any fluids for 8 hours prior to this picture (unless you want to change your undergarments). Anyway, on video or DVD you can always hit 'pause,' but you won't want to. The story is that involving.  It's the best film portrayal I've ever seen of the universal principle: Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.9/10.",9,0,0,27 May 2000
Ghost," Entertaining but silly
","I find 'Ghost' to be a highly entertaining bit of silliness.  The believability factor here is absolute zero, so leave your brain at the door -- but the film is funny, entertaining and moving at parts.  The (much discussed) ending IS in fact sickeningly sweet and sentimental (as well as straining credibility to the point of embarrassment), but it can't put the film into the 'new age drivel' category since the movie never does take itself very seriously.Overall, a very entertaining and engaging film with some over the top moments, and an ending almost as 'bad' as Fatal Attraction.  You don't have to enjoy love stories to like this film (although it will help) -- if you can suspend disbelief (or just ignore it) and don't have too many preconceived notions of 'after death,' you will be entertained.7/10",7,2,4,17 February 2002
Minority Report," Superb Sci-Fi
","'Minority Report' is the best sci-fi film I've seen since 'Blade Runner,' a P.K. Dick vision really brought to life -- greatly suspenseful, adventurous and riveting.  I do have some nit-picks with the film, mainly the new, popular 'fast motion' visual style of action, where it looks like the camera is handheld and frames are dropped on purpose.  Also, the (relatively minor) plot holes mentioned by other reviewers.*** minor spoilers follow ***I would have liked to have seen more character development (e.g. more about Agatha) and better plot development in regards to the whole 'minority report' concept and Anderton's son... this film could easily have run over 3 hours -- like A.I., it felt rushed, and a bit too ambitious given the running time.  Also like A.I., the film can't quite decide where to end. These flaws prevent 'Minority Report' from being a true classic in my eyes.Don't get me wrong though.  This is visionary science fiction, better than A.I. (which I did enjoy) in every conceivable sense.  The characters are 'real' and not stereotyped, the plot fast moving and believable within the world it creates, and my attention was riveted the entire time.  The special effects indeed go to further the story (a rare thing these days).
9/10 -- misses 'classic' status by a hair.  One more like this, and Spielberg will be up there with the science fiction greats like '2001' or 'Blade Runner.'",9,0,0,28 June 2002
G.I. Jane," Underrated, entertaining popcorn movie
","Well, don't go in seeing this movie if you have a bone to pick -- that applies to any movie, really.  Go see films to be entertained, or stay away from Hollywood and stay with art flicks and/or documentaries.  It would sure be nice if people just accepted the fact that Hollywood is about making money first, entertaining the public second, and everything else a distant third.  In my opinion, this is one of Ridley Scott's strongest films.  More entertaining than Gladiator (and more true-to-life -- we can relate to the characters here since they're all quite human and living in modern times, but not to General Maximus Decimus Meridus).  A nice coverage of Navy Seals in training (can't comment on the realism although I was in the Naval Reserves for 6 years), this is one of my favorite popcorn movies, and doesn't require the brain to be totally disengaged, which is a nice extra. 
Not a good buy (simply because it's too painful to watch regularly) but makes a great occasional rental.  Production values and cinematography are first-rate, and the storyline is incredibly entertaining (if ultimately uninspired).Why some people have savaged this film is beyond me.  Sure, it's cliched... but films like The Matrix and Saving Private Ryan aren't?  If you like action and/or military movies, just disregard the more blatant critics (I always do, knowing they have some personal agenda they're bringing to the film) and watch for enjoyment, without preconceptions... maybe you'll like it.  Leave your personal agendas and politics at the door and dive in.8/10",8,1,5,29 January 2002
Training Day," Grabbed my attention & never let go...
","This film really got to me like no movie has in a long time.  After about the first hour, I was on the edge of my seat and absolutely glued to the screen.  The ending was somewhat weak like has been commented here before, but I'm not sure I could have taken another moment of intensity... I was 'in' the picture and lost to the world like nothing in a very long time. You could have grabbed a sample of my blood and come up with nothing but pure adrenaline.Part of the reason might be a past history with a bit of street background in it (yes, I've met lowlifes although nothing as bad as portrayed here)... this brought up the atmosphere of some remembered horrors, and by the end of the film my heart was palpitating and I was physically choking.  I went into this film with no 'prior knowledge' whatsoever (as a rookie), and it might have been a near heart attack for this over-35 guy... next time I'll read up on the plot a bit first.For the average moviegoer, the realism may not jump out too much... if you've ever been on the streets sometime in recent memory (even briefly, and not necessarily in LA), this film is like spreading drugs out in front of a former junkie -- not pleasant, but try tearing your eyes away.  And Denzel... was truly a surprise.  I've never been too impressed by his somewhat wooden acting, but his 'moment' toward the end is up there with the best rant-fests I've seen from Al Pacino.  The 'best actor' Oscar was deserved, imho.9/10 (one point off for a weak ending).",9,3,14,27 March 2002
Se7en," Slightly overrated...
","I think 'Seven' is an excellent crime drama with great acting, script, cinematography and score. Somehow though, it hasn't held up (for me) over time and repeated viewings as well as it should. I just viewed it again today, and although enjoying it I no longer get the 'kick' I once did. Once the ending is known, it definitely loses some of its power. See the ending more than a few times, and that loss starts to extend over the last 20 minutes of the film as well (starting from the time the killer turns himself in).Something about the style of the film hasn't held up that wonderfully either, or maybe it's just been over-used at this point and feels tired. It could even be that I've gotten so jaded about 'stylish' films that they're all starting to look a little bit pretentious.I noticed there's a bit of recent backlash to all the '10 star' ratings and cult status of this film. Not unexpected, and maybe the reasons I've given above have something to do with it as well. As moviegoers, we've seen this kind of film a bit too often now, and it's lost some of its power to frighten or shock.Anyway, I'd still rate this movie highly, but I'm not so sure it's a masterpiece. A very good movie, yes. Worth watching, without a doubt (particularly if you enjoy this genre). Somehow I can envision John Malkovich playing the 'John Doe' role... he might have done very well, and certainly would have been interesting in the role.",8,2,5,17 April 2005
Unbreakable," Not broken too badly...
","I'm not much of a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's films or directorial style. Although I 'sort of' enjoyed The Sixth Sense in the theater, I made the mistake of buying it on DVD for some unknown reason -- it's impossible to enjoy that film more than once, because the 'twist' at the end is really the entire worth of the film, IMO.  Once that twist is known, the movie becomes a real bore, and is really not watchable more than one time.'Unbreakable' fared somewhat better in my eyes, but still lacks far too much.  Like others have commented, the ending is too abrupt.  Although I didn't see it coming, it just doesn't grant the viewer the 'payoff' they deserve.That said, I believe Unbreakable is actually the better film by far.  I could easily watch it again, knowing the 'surprise ending.'  The pacing of the movie was good most of the way through (I wasn't squirming in my seat like I was during 'A.I.'), the acting was reasonably good, and I didn't notice those funny camera angles like some of the other reviewers here.  To me, the 'problem' with Unbreakable lies mostly with the ending -- definitely anticlimactic and abrupt (and the text-over 'explanations' definitely detracted, in my opinion).  The surprise twist is delightful for approximately 10 seconds, at which point it fades.Also, I have to admit that I don't much appreciate the 'light-core horror/supernaturalism' genre.  Give me The Exorcist, Jacob's Ladder, Serpent and the Rainbow, Fallen or even Ghost over M. Night Shyamalan's watered-down, empty and un-moving brand of 'horror/supernatural' any day. Anyhow, I give Unbreakable a rating of 7/10 -- and mostly thanks to Samuel L. Jackson's great performance.P.S... I have an almost unused copy of 'The Sixth Sense' sitting here on DVD that I watched only 1/8 of the way through before falling asleep... anyone wanna buy it? (just kidding, no Emails please -- I'll dump it off on Ebay or something eventually).",7,0,0,12 July 2001
Monster," Hollywood's idea of low class
","It takes more than acting talent for a rich Hollywood actress to truly emulate the down-and-out, the homeless, prostitution, the so-called dregs of society... it takes true genius.  Charlize Theron is clearly no genius.  No amount of makeup, 'trash talk' or other pretense can communicate the pervasive sense of despair, the drug abuse, the mental illness, the real attitudes and situations that poverty tends to bestow upon a person... having had occasion to be temporarily homeless a few times, maybe I'm a better judge of this than most.  From the beginning this film had 'Hollywood pretense' written all over it, and I admit that I couldn't sit through any more after the first rape scene.  The film kept pegging my 'BS meter,' although it may appeal to the more privileged (Roger Ebert?) who really have no clue what it's like to live this sort of a lifestyle.  Perhaps I should have watched more in order to write a proper review, but the acting and situations portrayed just did not ring true to me at all. 5/10",5,5,11,16 June 2004
The Notebook," Good chemistry all around...
","Every different genre of film requires something different to make it special. Science fiction needs intelligent storytelling, war films require moving/agonizing drama. And of course, love stories need good chemistry between whoever's supposed to be in love. I thought this one had it in spades, with all concerned. It did get slightly melodramatic at the end, but nothing that anyone who enjoyed 'Somewhere in Time' (another movie that many love story fans are fond of) couldn't handle... in fact, the former was quite a bit more sappy or melodramatic, and in my opinion this one leans toward realism more than the average. I just saw it 'cold' on a cable channel without knowing anything about it, and was basically riveted to the screen the entire time. Recommended for fans of the genre, and others should at least dip their toe in and see how it strikes 'em. 8/10.",8,1,3,2 November 2006
Spider-Man 2," Tears of joy, and a standing ovation!
","As a kid growing up in the 1970's, I never missed Spider-Man in the comic books and the Sunday paper. By far, my all-time favorite villain and episode(s) involved Doctor Octopus.I was severely disappointed by the first Spider-Man, and had pretty much given up on Hollywood ever doing a proper comic book adaptation. Although the first one was watchable and not too bad, it fell far short of my expectations. At best, it was mediocre.This one not only met and exceeded them, but it utterly overwhelmed them. Finally, I have lived the dreams of my childhood brought to life on the big screen, and clearly CGI has at last achieved its potential. God, but I regret having missed this in the theater! If you ever liked comic books, Spider-Man or the Dr. Octopus episodes then RUN, don't walk, to your nearest video store and rent this. Then RUN, don't walk, and buy it so you can watch it over and over.This film has renewed my hope that Hollywood still has a vision, and still has capable (even excellent) screenwriters, directors, animators and producers.The best movie of 2004, and easily among the five or ten best movies I've ever seen. An easy 10/10.",10,1,3,15 February 2005
Batman Returns," The best Batman...
","To me, this was the best of the Batman series.  A storyline of much greater complexity and interest than the original, a much better-looking Gotham City, and the interactions between the Penguin (bird) and Catwoman (cat) are cute and funny.  Both Keaton and DeVito turn in great performances, Pfeiffer's has been better but not too shabby.  I really liked this movie, and didn't care much for any of the other (modern) Batman movies.  The first is probably second-best to this one, and after that the series just went off the edge of the cliff.  8/10.",8,0,0,12 November 2000
Lost in Translation," Excelente
","I've seen this movie twice now, and for some reason enjoyed it much more the second time. I was lucky enough to see it without ever having heard any of the hype (I don't follow Hollywood anymore, since most of what's released is junk) or even knowing who directed it. I must say it was interesting the first time, but seemed somewhat long and a little bit confusing. The second time I saw the film, I really enjoyed everything about it more... the ambiance, the amazing chemistry between Johansson and Murray, and the basic story. This is both a hyper-modern and meandering tale, and not everyone's going to 'get' it, or be able to get past the hype. It truly is not for everyone. I believe those who do enjoy it will really like it a lot... in a way, it's a 'love it or hate it' sort of picture. Put my squarely in the 'love it' camp. This is somewhat to my own surprise, because this is not really 'my type' of film. Yet I love it anyway. 9/10.",9,3,6,17 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Laughable acting/dialogue uplifted by great effects...
","... and then, brought down by the fakey ones.  Yep, I'd say about 80% of the effects in this film were outstanding, and about 20% were so laughably fake-looking and absurd that it just drags down the whole 'believability' factor.  Just when I start to believe 'I'm really there,' something reminds me I'm looking at poor digital seaming.  The scenes toward the beginning where Anakin and others were falling out the hovercraft & being caught looked as bad as any 1970's cheesy blue-screen effect I've ever seen.No comment on the acting and dialogue (nothing to say to the nonexistent), but I suppose the plot was OK... a bit slow, it dragged in the wrong places, etc.  Anyway, here's my breakdown:Plot: +3, Great effects: +7  = 10Acting/dialogue: (10) -7 = 3Poor effects: (3) -3 = 0Oops...!  Can't rate it a zero.  Well, I'll give it 5/10 for 'effort' and a mild entertainment value -- better luck next time, George.",5,0,1,14 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," LOTR: The Video Game
","I really don't understand the hype and attention surrounding this film.  It basically plays out like a video game version of the book.  Are people so bereft of imagination that they have to see it up on a screen in order to really enjoy it?As an avid reader, I occasionally run across a book that makes me think 'gosh, this would really make a great movie.'  In fact, after reading Stephen King's 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' years before it was made into a film, I thought about that -- and the rest is history.Many have commented that LOTR is one of those stories that just don't translate well to the big screen, so what's the point?  And in my opinion, it honestly didn't translate well to the screen.  The story feels rushed, the action sequences feel like a video game and unless someone has read the books, it's impossible to care about the fates of any of the characters.  No matter what people say, this film is primarily by fans, for fans -- and that isn't a formula that translates into any kind of quality.What has happened to people?  How could this passable yet ultimately mediocre screen translation have made it to #1 on the IMDB?  I suspect it's because people are really wanting a continuation of the saga of Middle Earth, which I understand... being a big fan of LeGuin's 'Earthsea' trilogy, I wanted more books featuring Ged's adventures among the islands too (the fourth book was almost a 'sellout').  But I wouldn't want to see the Earthsea trilogy butchered like 'FOTR' through translation to a format that's totally unsuitable.  LOTR might have made a great, high-budget miniseries, but condensing each book into ~3 hours is just flat-out impossible, it's butchery.  Murder by camera lens.I'm sure the video game (coming soon, no doubt) will sell millions of copies, because apparently that's what people want... an escape into imagination and fantasy, and for some reason this particular story is 'it' to many people.  There's nothing wrong with that, but why aren't the books good enough?  You have to have Tolkien's subtlety browbeaten into you with 'The Mummy' style CGI and sound effects, too?10/10 for the book series, 5/10 for the movie (great visuals, poor everything else).",5,10,18,5 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Stunning visuals, muddled dialogue
","OK, here's my impression -- from someone who has never read the books.The visuals in this film were stunning, especially the landscape shots.  The CGI was great (although all CGI is looking distinctly fake to me these days) -- this film is sure to win some awards for visual effects and sound effects editing.  Too bad they don't make 'em like they used to in the early 80's though, amazing how false & plastic an over-usage of computer graphics makes a movie appear.As for the story and the dialogue -- well, I'd like to know what went on in the film.  Maybe 30% of what was said was intelligible at all.  I don't think it's my ears, because the person I attended the film with had the same problem.  Nor do I think it had to do with the speaker system in the theater.  Rather, it was a combination of loud special effects, swelling music and hastily-recited lines.  At first it was frustrating because I really wanted to know what the characters were saying, but after the first 30 minutes of the film I just gave up and watched it as a long (long, looonnnggg) exercise in special effects and sound.  Fight scene after fight scene for what, a ring?  I don't mean to question Tolkien (g-d forbid), but why not just toss the frikkin thing down a deep well somewhere?Sorry, but I have to be able to hear the dialogue in the first place to get interested and stay interested in a film -- and I don't think it's too much to ask that the characters speak so they can be understood.5/10",5,2,6,4 January 2002
Grease," Fun, silly and cheesy...
","Entertaining, silly and cheesy/goofball late 70's 'classic' musical about (supposedly) 1950's high school students.  To me, this film has much more of a late 70's 'feel' than anything else, despite the 50's hairstyles and cars. Characters are likeable enough to get attached to by film's end, despite lots of stereotypes and near zero character development all around.  I was 14 when this came out in theaters, and certain lines (even tone of voices when uttered) still strike a chord, although this film fails to evoke a nostalgic feeling.  'Sandra Dee's' sudden transformation at the end is totally unconvincing, which doesn't help the film any.  Lots of 'gratuitous smoking' (not a terribly good message for kids), although given when it was made and the time period it's meant to portray I'm not terribly surprised. Overall, a feel-good musical from a more innocent time (1978), great for those who get a nostalgia kick from it but little else. 6/10.",6,1,7,27 February 2004

Like some others, I have a few beefs with the end scenes (there were several 'could have ended it' points, my preference would have been immediately after the 'ice in my glass' talk), but overall this movie had a lot to say (and a terrific actor to 'say it').  As for those who think it was boring, I don't know... what were you expecting?

","John Carpenter's 'The Thing' has that indefinable SOMETHING, combined with so much atmosphere (helped greatly by the soundtrack) that turns a good movie into a cult classic.  This film is genuinely CREEPY, and can be watched over and over.  I own it on DVD and *never* get tired of it.  The interactions between the men at the antarctic outpost are done so well, the acting is excellent, the story is scary and creepy and the special effects... well, at this point I'll just say 'See the movie.'  I highly doubt you'll regret it.  10/10",9,0,1,13 January 2001
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Lives up to the series, lacks suspense...
","'T3: Rise of the Machines' had some serious living up to do as far as the first two films are concerned.  In my opinion it doesn't disgrace the series, especially in terms of pure action.  However, it is the weakest of the three in terms of both story and sci-fi.The film, like many other movies with a lot of 'over-the-top' action, suffers from a curious lack of suspense.  Not that suspense was completely absent, but it takes a strong, coherent story along with powerful acting and believable plot to support a film with this much 'in your face' action, and the film doesn't have it.  Ultimately, nothing much happens, and none of the characters are terribly likeable.  I didn't care too much about what happened to them, in stark contrast to the first two films -- I never felt they were really in any serious danger.  The humor was nice (it really was funny) but always seemed to come at a time when we should have been concerned for the fate of the characters instead.** A few spoilers **I also have issues with the Terminatrix, who displayed a lot of unevenness as far as her abilities go... in the scenes just before she's terminated (am I really spoiling anything?) she looks a lot like an advanced T-101, with parts hanging off everywhere -- yet in the rest of the film it's suggested she's at least as advanced as the 'bad' terminator in T2, which was made of liquid metal.  In terms of Skynet, the idea that the system has no central core and is distributed 'over the Internet' is both good and bad.. it makes sense to us, yet it's cliched and silly too (and science-wise, downright impossible).Overall, I enjoyed the movie greatly.  I was greatly entertained by the action, yet afterward the film just felt kind of hollow and vanished from my mind rather quickly... nothing all too memorable ever happened, and I really feel this movie is ultimately another forgettable summer actioner that will be OK released as a series of DVD's with the first two films, but just doesn't stand up alone as a terribly worthy addition to the Terminator franchise.By far the weakest of the Terminator series (except for the action, which was great, maybe too great)... 7/10.",7,0,0,5 July 2003
American Beauty," Perfect Beauty
","Oh, my God... I never thought I would see it in my lifetime: *The Perfect Ten Screenplay*.I missed this one in the theater, and after all the hoopla at the Academy Awards, I figured it was worth bypassing, despite its number two status on the IMDB.  It didn't seem to be 'my type of movie,' from what I had heard about it.  I'm happy to say that I was as wrong as can be.  This film deserves every Academy Award, every nomination, every other award and accolade it has gotten and will ever get.  I'm only kicking myself now that I didn't see it when it was in the theater, to become transfixed and hypnotized for two short hours, and the chance to rise and give a standing ovation.I wouldn't know where to begin reviewing a film like this, a film so much greater than the sum of its parts, surpassing even its own vision of itself, literally transcending its ideas.  I won't comment on the acting, because I didn't even notice any acting in this film.  I was just captivated every second, transfixed.Now that a screenplay has been written that is worthy of a 10/10 rating (I've seen a couple 9.9's), this film can only be equalled; never surpassed. Being 35 years old, I doubt I will live to see its equal again, and I'm grateful that I was around to catch it at the midpoint of life.I don't need to say anything else, because if you haven't seen 'American Beauty' and you're wasting your time reading this dumb review instead, why aren't you on your way to the video store, *RIGHT NOW*? GO!!!10/10",10,0,0,12 May 2000
Spider-Man," All the subtlety of a sledgehammer...
","... but that's OK in a comic book film.  Perhaps unfortunately, this has all been done before in the first couple 'Batman' films, and the first couple 'Superman' films.  The entire movie carried a weight of 'haven't I seen this scene before?' over and over again.I'm a great fan of the original 'Spiderman' series of comic books (which I read avidly as a kid), but I have to agree with Ebert on this one -- the action just looks unrealistic.  A physical body cannot move that quickly or smoothly, defying the laws of space, time and gravity.  That took a lot of fun out of the action sequences for me.The plot itself is interesting and involving, but *very* rehashed from a number of other superhero-type movies.  Nary an original moment in the entire running-time of the film... nothing genuinely creative at all. 'Spiderman cereal' will probably leave a sweeter taste in your mouth.My conclusion is that I can't recommend you pay US$7.50 to see this one in the theater, unless you honestly loved the recent 'Planet of the Apes' remake and the two 'Mummy' films.  Wait for the DVD release (rumored to be in November 2002 I think), the film will look just as good (if not better) on the small screen.  This movie is NOT a blockbuster... see the 1978 version of 'Superman' if you want superhero action, it out-does this film in every conceivable aspect (even the special effects category).6/10",6,0,0,9 May 2002
Dark City," An uninteresting, uneven film
","'Dark City' is a 1940's 'film noir' rehash disguised as science fiction. The problems with this movie involve a weak plot, uneven pacing and an uninteresting story.  What really bothers me is that Roger Ebert panned 'Blade Runner' for its lack of a human element (which it had in spades), while giving this movie (which has no human element at all to it) four stars.  This speaks to me more of Roger Ebert than the movie, and the fact that he likes to see rehashes of what he considers 'art films.'  Although this movie may have 'art,' it's completely lacking in 'heart.'  I found 'The Matrix' a much better film (I've seen both on DVD).  The Matrix had at its base a strong philosophical doctrine, a deeper meaning beyond the prevalent kung-fu scenes that is apt to be remembered for a long time to come. 'Dark City' is nothing more than a bland mood piece, an emotionless and ultimately meaningless movie that will be lost in the memories of filmgoers as better movies come along.  7/10 for effort.",10,0,1,27 September 1999
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The best so far...
","Not only does 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' manage to shed most of the syrupy 'kid-stuff' atmosphere of its predecessors, it comes amazingly close to the status of a true fantasy classic.Fresh, original and creative, this film is visually and subtextually unpredictable; the change of directors stands out like a breath of fresh air. Even the musical score is a major improvement. This is saying a lot... I enjoyed the first two movies, in particular the second. This one I enjoyed on a much different and 'higher' level. It is in fact 'darker' than the first two as often claimed, but still quite appropriate for kids. What really makes this one different is that it's appropriate for adults as well... parents, go see and enjoy this one with your kids.9/10",9,0,1,16 January 2005
American History X," Disappointing...
","'American History X' was a good, entertaining movie.  That's what's so disappointing about it.  It could have been a *great* movie, but it turned out to be merely a decent one.  I wouldn't be saying this if I hadn't really liked the picture.  There was some real potential in this film, and the potential was never realized.  Roger Ebert sums up my views very well in his review.  It's always rather painful to see a movie that 'wants to take off and soar' end up sitting on the ground (albeit sitting very well).  I also agree with Ebert that the fault was mainly in the direction.  If the movie had a great director, it would have been a great film.  As it stands, it had a decent director, so it turned out to be a decent film. 7/10.",7,0,0,31 October 1999
Die Hard 2," Exciting, action-packed blockbuster
","'Die Hard 2' is the best of the series, in my opinion.  Bruce Willis shows a range and depth in this film well beyond what he had in the first one. There's plenty of violence, but very little of it is gratuitous; most of it goes to further the plot, which is an excellent one in my opinion.  There are plenty of surprises and things you wouldn't have guessed, the pacing is near-perfect, and the airplane crash scene is absolutely bone-chilling. You may never fly in a commercial aircraft again!  For elevating the action-thriller genre well above the usual norm, I give this movie 9/10 stars.",9,1,3,10 December 1999
Meet the Fockers," A pale shadow of the original
","Unfortunately, 'Meet the Fockers' does not live up to the promise of its predecessor. The jokes are not particularly funny, the writing is loose and lacks direction, and it's clear nobody's having fun doing this -- it's purely a job for these actors, and an attempt to cash in on the original.All that said, the movie is not all that bad. It's mildly entertaining and occasionally engaging, but it really requires that you've seen 'Meet the Parents' to fully enjoy it. Many of the jokes are unfortunately recycled from the original, and bits and pieces of 'Flirting with Disaster' can also be found here and there. The film is like a collage of many past comedies, but in the context of the first film. There's little attempt at originality, and really none of the little moments that made the first film so enjoyable. The directing is loose and rather aimless.All in all, worth a watch if you really liked 'Meet the Parents,' otherwise skip it.6/10",6,0,1,19 January 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," As dumb as it gets...
","I didn't know this was a vampire movie before watching... my brother rented it.  Up until the scene when everyone turns into demons, I didn't suspect what was coming... and needless to say, I wasn't impressed.  Let me put it differently -- by the end of the movie, I realized what a horrendous piece of cr*p all of it was.  Basically, it's two movies in one, purporting to be one film... which it isn't.  Err, or I should say, is it?  Whatever it is, it's surely a waste of the plastic used to make the DVD.  If you like bad movies... don't waste your time.  2/10",2,2,6,14 November 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," One of the true greats
","I'm not sure there's much left to be said about '2001, A Space Odyssey' 35 years after its release -- yet in another sense, nothing meaningful has yet been said about it.  This is easily the greatest, grandest and most poetic piece of science fiction ever put to celluloid.  A work of art in every sense of the term, it has so much to say about where mankind has been and where it is going.This is one film that simply defies being picked apart and analyzed.  If you haven't seen it yet, please do so on a 'slow Sunday' when you're relaxed and ready to view an epic sort of film (something on the order of '10 Commandments').  Then just settle in and view one genius filmmaker's conception of the scientific and the spiritual, and where they ultimately meet in the great story that is Mankind.An easy 10/10.",10,1,5,17 August 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Cometh the emperor...
","This film must be the ultimate example of the 'Emperor has no clothes' syndrome, not to mention the combined degeneration of both Hollywood and the general movie-going public.To start this naked but well-dressed festival, we have two lovers (Carrey and Winslet) with absolutely no on screen chemistry. The plot thickens -- lots of artsy photography with little substance (ala 'The Cell' or 'Vanilla Sky'), and it continues its well-plotted plotlessness with, well, no real plot to speak of.The silliness continues with soap-opera intensity, as we get a bizarre love triangle between the memory doctor and Kirsten Dunst, as well as Winslet and several servings of Sum Yung Guy.The film ends with a deep examination of the shallow question: 'Is it better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all?' A pointless question if there ever was one, as one has either loved or not loved, and therefore need not inquire.Abstract art is often accused of being pointless and artless, a false accusation if there ever was one -- there's talented abstract art, and untalented abstract art, and it's not hard to pick which is which if you have any sort of eye for talent. In the same vein, there are 'arty' films that are truly artistic, as well as pretentious vehicles designed to make money and help shallow people weep crocodile tears of joy at the sheer depth of it all. Unfortunately, ESOTSM is of the latter category.Can we dress the big fat guy wearing the crown now?",4,0,3,16 April 2005
Titanic," Still works for me...
","Well, it's been a year since my last review of this film (this is review #3).  I saw 'Titanic' on the big screen in 1997, and bought the DVD when it came out (which I still watch from time to time, maybe about twice/year).'Titanic' still works for me as an epic spectacle and blockbuster.  The love story is OK, I don't really care... this is the movie to watch for eye candy and epic scope, not emotion.  I never did get caught up in any sobby or sentimental emotions with this film.  The overall story isn't bad... yes, some of the lines are cheesy and the dialog is corny, so what?  The low point of the film has to be DiCaprio sinking beneath the waves... not sad at all to me, but so what?'Titanic' stands as a fabulous spectacle and a great movie watching experience.  The years have not diminished that in the least, and the special effects couldn't be done any better today than they were in 1997. The nit-pickers are still picking, 'sentimentalists' are still getting outraged at the 'realists' bashing the film, and I'm still sitting back and enjoying a couple times a year a film that was highly overrated at the Oscars (so what else is new) but where every penny of the budget shows on the screen... the spectacle of it... the scope, it can sweep you away.  Turn your brain off, turn the lights down, and enjoy on the biggest possible screen.9/10 pieces of popcorn from this 38 year old male.",9,8,14,26 March 2002
Titanic," Still a 'Titanic' movie!
","Well here it is, three years after the release of Titanic, and the movie is still eminently watchable.  I have the DVD version, and watch it occasionally.  I've come to realize that the love story (which MANY have complained about) serves to offset the 'disaster' portion of the movie *perfectly*.  Without it, watching 'Titanic' would simply be a bleak and depressing experience.  But notice how the love story reaches its peak JUST as the ship crashes into the iceberg, and a crossover effect is achieved -- disaster intersects with love and the human spirit.  Without the love story (and no, I didn't think it was particularly cheesy), Titanic would not be the movie that it is.People have said that this movie has 'aged' poorly since its original release.  I don't think so.  I saw it three times on the big screen when it came out, and bought the DVD when *it* first came out.  Multiple viewings have not diminished this movie for me.  It still stands as the finest movie of 1997, and the best epic disaster film ever made.  Remember, this movie is not a documentary, and was never intended to be.  Some people don't quite seem to get that point.  As for Leonardo Dicaprio, I do feel they could have chosen a different actor for the part and it would have improved things, but only a little.  This film has only one lead character, the Titanic Herself. All the rest are extras, albeit important ones.If you're one of those rare birds who hasn't seen 'Titanic' yet, don't listen to its detractors.  Watch the movie and judge it for yourself.  I won't comment on the special effects, except to say they're incredible and 99% seamless.  The story (taken as a whole) is profound and moving.  No other disaster film (the innumerable 'Airport 19xx's' and others) have managed to capture the human side of a major 20th century disaster so effectively.  And this is still a great 'date movie' as well.  It succeeds from many, many angles -- so many that its flaws (yes, it has some) can and should be overlooked.  Director James Cameron put his heart and soul into this film, and it shows.Verdict: Acquitted on ALL charges and rated 9/10 for true excellence in filmmaking.",9,1,2,30 May 2000
Titanic," Hype, schmipe!
","Many have commented recently that 'Titanic' was overrated/overhyped, some even saying it was 'the most overhyped movie in history' (somehow I doubt that... perhaps Waterworld might take that prize, or maybe Independence Day or Jurassic Park).Anyway, what makes no sense to me is this... why haven't you shaken off the hype yet?  The movie isn't playing in theaters anymore, it isn't being hyped up anywhere.  So can't you just put in in your DVD player/VCR/whatever and watch it for what it is?  I mean, that's all it ever was anyway, 'hype' is just 'consensus conditioning' and you don't have to be affected by it at all unless you choose to.That said, I maintain my stance that 'Titanic' is still a great, entertaining film, that it was never meant to be a documentary (and would have suffered greatly without the tension-relieving love-story subplot), and my agreement that DiCaprio was a poor choice for the male lead.Anyway... I can put the DVD in every once in awhile, sit back and watch this movie for what it shows me... the 'hype' was forgotten over three years ago. And I like the film.  If you don't like the film, fine, but quit complaining about it being overhyped and/or overrated.  Do you still remember the weather the day the film was released, too?",9,1,3,30 January 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Well done... Kudos!
","I'm one of the 'holdouts' who hasn't read the books (I like Ursula K. Leguin's 'Earthsea' series, so I figure I'd enjoy this story, although it's somewhat derivative of 'A Wizard of Earthsea').  Anyway, I kept wishing I was 10 years old when I saw this, because I would have enjoyed it more. Still, the film was undeniably magical, the CGI/Special effects weren't overdone (or were seamless enough to blend in), and the acting was excellent.Agreed with other reviewers that the film never 'soars' and never fully achieves what it could, but attribute this to squeezing so much plot into the film's running time.  If this movie is as faithful to the book as I understand, then it's a rarity -- 'Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Green Mile' are two others that manage to be faithful to the book, yet in the former case somehow outdoes the book (may be the first and only time).Anyway, I'm rambling.  This film was magical & entertaining, especially for kids.  I think it suffers only from the fact that expectations were set too high due to hype, and the unbelievable popularity of the books.  You just can't expect a film to live up to the potential of the book, especially if the book is tremendously good -- it's patently unfair to judge a film based on that criteria.  9/10.",9,0,0,1 December 2001

A Beautiful Mind," A typical movie...
","'A Beautiful Mind' is typical Hollywoodized claptrap designed to jerk the heartstrings of the average viewer, with Russell Crowe overacting like a fool.  Hopefully this film will drop out of the IMDB top 250 soon, as it's one of the more overrated films in movie history.  To be honest, I cannot imagine most of the 'real life' occurrences actually happening anything like the way they did in the film.  Crowe is one of the most egotistical and psychologically messed-up actors around, and it's clear here that he thinks he's another Marlon Brando.  Hollywood has done little to disabuse him of this notion.  Who knows what further silliness and excesses we can expect from Mr. Crowe in the future?The film isn't too bad if you ignore the blatantly manipulative elements. The story is engaging enough thanks to decent acting (particularly from Ed Harris and Christopher Plummer), and the film is watchable on a more 'mindless' level -- it's fun to watch these top-list actors doing their stuff.  However, rest assured that this is not an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia, or of the real-life John Nash's life.Anyway, 'A Beautiful Mind' is worth a watch if it comes on cable (currently playing on HBO), and you should make up your own mind.  From where I'm standing, it's pretty much one of those flicks designed to attract Academy voters at Oscar time and tug on the heart-strings of gullible viewers.  You may see things that are not really there, of course.  6/10.",6,1,4,27 March 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Uninspired & flat...
","'A Beautiful Mind' is one of those 'Oscar(tm)-aimed' films like Gladiator that pretend to transcend Hollywood, and in the process appear eminently 'Hollywood' (and mostly forgettable after the Oscars (tm)). 
Uninspired performances, unrealistic and oversimplified portrayal of schizophrenia and (unforgivably), a dull screenplay.  I kept looking at my watch through this one, and wasn't for one moment drawn into the story. There are no characters we can really empathize with in this film, and so it becomes an exercise in tedium.The film does a good job in creating the general paranoid atmosphere one would attribute to schizophrenia, but doesn't succeed in conveying the 'reality' of it.  Nash's 'delusions' are obviously hallucinations(look up the difference if you don't know already), and the character is not sharply drawn or particularly interesting.  Jennifer Connelly's acting is rarely better than 'by the book,' and nobody really seems very passionate about whatever characters they're playing.Sorry guys, try again.  Yes, I do like movies in this vein, as long as they're well-done... this one hardly qualifies as 'medium rare.' 6/10.",6,0,2,2 January 2002

I was especially taken by the plight of the little girl in the film, and her near descent into catatonia produced by all the stress. An interesting examination of how almost unbearable stress can affect people.The special effects were first rate, although not 100% convincing... however, they were convincing enough to enjoy the film and be able to sustain disbelief.Overall, a fun roller-coaster romp that requires no brain power whatsoever.

Bram Stoker's Dracula," It Grows...
","'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is one of those films that absolutely *demands* repeat viewings to appreciate.  The first time I saw it I would have rated it a 4 or 5 maybe, but it has only 'grown on me' over the years.The movie never takes itself seriously, which may disappoint horror fans looking for 'the real deal', as suggested by the film's title and director. Truly corny/inane lines of dialogue are regularly followed by inspired passages, creating an engaging, quirky experience.One of the geniuses of this movie is the playing off of one of the world's worst actors (Keanu Reaves, in what has to be his flattest, most sophomoric and lifeless performance to date) against one of the best (Gary Oldman, who's obviously relishing this role) -- the contrast creates a fascinating film dynamic in which Reeves' character seems to almost disappear from the screen, while making Gary Oldman's acting (as Dracula) appear ten times better.  It almost seems as though the casting was planned that way -- anyway, it works well.  Tom Waits (as Renfield) gives a real gem of a performance here... sadly, he gets very little screen time.  Winona Ryder is... well, Winona Ryder.  Her character works as Jonathan Harker's fiance, but not nearly as well as Dracula's 'love interest'.  Anthony Hopkins plays a darkly comic Van Helsing, yet another truly enjoyable performance.Some of the best scenes are toward the beginning of the film, in the castle. One really gets the impression of dark, squiggly things hiding in corners and terrifying secrets kept over centuries.  As always, Gary Oldman grabs and holds your attention, smoothing over plot sections that might start to stutter and drag in the hands of a less seasoned actor.It definitely takes repeated viewings to get to the point where you're really questioning (and understanding) what's happening there on the screen -- and when it finally clicks, the movie 'works' exceptionally well as a 'kitchen sink' horror/comedy/tragedy/romance.  In all likelihood, you won't enjoy it too much the first time (except for select performances), but reserve your judgment and try again a few months later.8.5/10",8,1,2,16 November 2001

However, if it's pure story you're interested in, try the 1979 version of Dracula starring Frank Langella - it's much better.  Or see both, and decide for yourself!

The Green Mile," Can a long life be worse than death?
","With all the pain & suffering in the world, can a long life be worse than death?  Is it possible to live too long and see too much?  'The Green Mile' raises these questions, and a whole lot more.  Directed to perfection by Frank Darabont, superbly acted by an ensemble cast and with an original story by Stephen King and Frank Darabont, this is as good as it gets at the movies.  I won't make the often-stated claim that 'this is the best movie of all time' or even the best film I've ever seen, but it manages to deal with real spiritual and existential issues as meaningful as life and death, pain and suffering, and 'sin' and 'retribution' in a way I've rarely had the privilege of seeing on film, and manages to entertain to the max as well (if you liked it, try 'Dead Man Walking' as well).

Jaws," It has lost something...
","'Jaws' has lost something over the years, particularly in the last 4 or 5 years (or so it seems).  I used to count this among my all time favorite movies, even quite recently.  Today I watched the movie again after awhile (9 months or so?) and it's starting to look very dated and somewhat silly to me.  The first part of the film (before the shark hunt) is really rather dull and uninspired, if you think about it... nothing very interesting happens, a few shark attacks and some resort town politics.  The scenes in the boat before the finale (particularly Robert Shaw's famous speech about the Indianapolis) are as inspired as ever, but then things get very silly and unrealistic.  The shark chases the boat, purposely attacking?  A shark intelligent enough to desire revenge...?  Please -- give me a break.Overall the movie is still fun, but either I've changed recently or the years are just increasingly unkind to this film.  It no longer looks like an inspired work of genius to me, just a decent and rather cheesy mid 70's action/adventure flick.  I wouldn't expect today's audiences to get terribly excited, and am curious what the reaction would be if 'Jaws' were released today with nothing much changed but the special effects.  I suspect it wouldn't get a tenth as much attention as it has.",9,0,2,11 February 2004
Jaws," The best shark movie ever made
","Few can argue that 'Jaws' was the best shark/sea adventure movie ever made. A plot and character-driven work of art, so many scenes are memorable that it's hard to know where to begin -- the famous 'Indianapolis' scene, where Robert Shaw blows us away with his acting; Hooper's confrontation in the shark cage; Quint's mad run for shore, with the shark chasing the boat; and of course the finale where (surprise!) it's Chief Brody who scores the triumph over the shark.Some may complain about the mechanical shark, with which there were endless problems during filming.  Before you do so, try to imagine it being done with computer graphics.  I'd rather see a few obviously fake-looking scenes (and really, there were VERY few of these) than see that shark in (un)glorious CGI.  So many movies these days take the cheap way out with computer graphics... it takes great artistry to make computer-generated images look seamless and real.  Many filmmakers don't seem to realize that, or they just don't care, and so we get obviously digital-looking junk.Spielberg has finally relented and is releasing Jaws on DVD this summer! Look for many glorious extras -- I'm positive a brand new 'making of' is already completed, or is in the works.  Now those who were too young to see it at the theater when it came out (I was 11, and lucky enough to see it on the big screen) will get to see it in much of its original, restored glory. If you don't have a big-screen TV or home theater system, watch it on a computer DVD-player (preferably with surround-sound speakers) for a simulated big-screen experience.Rating: 10/10",9,0,1,6 May 2000

That is simply incredible for a film released seven years ago, absolutely mindblowing.  This movie captured more than just a generation, it captured the hearts and minds of the global moviegoing public, and apparently will not let go.Think of the hundreds of films released since 1994... and realize that 'Shawshank Redemption' holds the #2 spot... on the world's most popular film site -- truly the worldwide *people's* democratic vote!If you still haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself.  With perhaps the most cathartic, satisfying ending in film history, superb, sharply-defined characters and plot, plot, plot... this is the film to see if you love movies, and even if you hate movies.  If you see only one movie in your lifetime, this may be the one to see (you can read 'The Godfather', which in my opinion is much better in book format).A work of art that is not going to go away, 'Shawshank Redemption' is the best prison movie ever released and one of the greatest films of all time.",10,0,0,29 January 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," A marvel of filmmaking...
","As near to perfect as a movie can get, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is absolutely superlative entertainment.  I keep wondering at those who claim the movie is too long (as many also did for the fantastic 'Green Mile').  I wonder if MTV, television newscasts, commercials and other things have destroyed the attention span of several generations of people.  Nobody seems to be able to stick with anything for more than an absolute maximum of two hours anymore.  It's a disappointing trend, because often a great story cannot be told in the usual 120-minute maximum alloted to most films.If you have the attention span to watch a film longer than two hours, movies just don't get any better than this one does.  Don't look for realism (try PBS or any documentary for that), look for plot, acting talent and (above all): Simply a good, satisfying tale!  The Shawshank Redemption has it all, in spades, and Frank Darabont is on his way to an absolutely stellar directing career.  Kudos to Stephen King as well for his excellent novella, 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,' which obviously helped make this film possible.  10/10.",10,0,0,26 April 2000
Blade Runner," The classic... One of the best Sci-Fi's...

Yes, I saw it when it first came out on the big screen in 1982... AND the director's cut -- in a theater.  I loved it the first time, and I'm one of those rare birds who like the original cut with Ford's voice-over just a tiny bit better (probably because I saw it in the theater).Both the original Star Wars and Blade Runner have those incredible openings in common -- with Star Wars, the grand entrance of Darth Vader, with Blade Runner -- the view of Los Angeles from above.  Absolutely unforgettable on both counts.  Filmmakers should realize that creating a feeling of awe in the audience at the beginning is the way to go, because that sense is going to remain through the entire film (as long as the movie is reasonably good otherwise).I think the film finally gained the respect it deserved when the director's cut was released.  The audience at the showing I was at gave the film a standing ovation.Now what I'm wondering is this: Blade Runner was one of the first DVD's I ever bought -- and the transfer is horrendous!  Have newer versions been released?  Anyone who knows please Email me through IMDB.  The one I have is a Warner Home Video (1991) director's cut flipper with a standard version on one side and widescreen on the other.  If something newer has been released, could someone let me know?

Several have brought up the 'atheist in a foxhole' thing, but apparently they weren't paying attention to the movie (granted, Shymalan's films require a far better than average attention span). Gibson's character never lost his faith, but rather is angry at God over the death of his wife and is despairing (this point is very clearly delineated by a certain scene).  Also, it's interesting that most of the negative reviews tend to focus on inane, cerebral nit-picks that have nothing to do with 'willing suspension of disbelief' (which is critical to the enjoyment of a fantasy film such as this).  For example, the comments about water, comments like 'this couldn't happen' or 'that couldn't happen'.... all I can think of to say is 'no kidding, we aren't watching a docu-drama.'  If you can't relax, surrender and allow a movie to stir your subconscious, stay away from Shyamalan films. Perhaps the director succeeded all too well here -- people certainly seem to be polarized over this one, but few are indifferent.  9/10 (please read Roger Ebert's review, which I agree with for the most part).",9,0,2,18 August 2002
Signs," Superb!
","'Signs' is M. Night Shyamalan at the top of his form.  Every scene meticulously crafted, awe-inspiring camera work and some genuine scares. Interestingly, the two people I saw this film with didn't like it.  One thought it was completely contrived and predictable (which I don't understand at all).  Perhaps Shyamalan creates 'thinking person's' films, I really don't know.  Having seen both 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' (I liked both, although it took several viewings to understand what the director was aiming at), this one was by far his best work.  Fascinating, flawed and unstereotyped characters (a bit weird, but 'real' nonetheless) and a wonderful slow pace thankfully free of too much flash and special effects.  Spectactular camera work, a haunting atmosphere... what more can you ask?Hold on... except for the last 5 minutes.  I think I 'got' the faith message, and didn't need it hammered in with a baseball bat.  I would have rated this film 10/10 except for that one flaw (which I suppose is necessary with a movie intended for 'mass audiences', and please don't take that statement as elitist).  9/10.",9,0,2,14 August 2002
The Deer Hunter," The death of...?
","OK, I got that the killing of the deer was supposed to represent 'the death of innocence,' but it almost seemed more like the death of morons.  I mean, before 'nam did these guys do anything but drink beer, p*ss, and repeat the cycle?  Beavis and Buttheads of the late '60's.  Is this a fair portrayal of the Vietnam generation?OK, the scenes in Vietnam were great, but the dialog in this film seems muffled and very hard to understand.  The movie is overlong, and far too much time is spent on certain scenes (such as the wedding).  Pacing is not so great.  Cinematography is only average.Overall, I give 'The Deer Hunter' 8/10.  It scores (especially in the acting department), but in my opinion doesn't stand up to many later war films. Given a game of russian roulette between 'Thin Red Line,' 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'Apocalypse Now,' 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket,' this film unfortunately gets one of the full chambers.",9,0,1,24 February 2001
The Sixth Sense," Sharp, Haunting Thriller
","'The Sixth Sense' was a sharp, haunting thriller that was almost painful to watch.  The main thing that distracted me from this movie was a constant feeling of pity for the main character in the story, a little boy.  Not only was the kid living in constant terror, but nobody believed him, and it looked like he would be locked up in a mental ward.  Focusing on the constant pain the boy was in was to me a major distraction, causing me to lose track of a lot of subtle details I otherwise would have noticed.  I didn't find the movie terribly entertaining.  However, like most others, I was *COMPLETELY* blindsided by the surprise ending - I didn't see it coming at all, and when it comes it's a real shock.  The audience in the theater I saw the movie in let out a loud, collective gasp of exhaustion and fascination when the end credits started to roll, as if they had been holding their breath for two hours.  This is a movie I would like to see again, now that I know how it ends.  9/10.",9,0,0,21 September 1999
The Matrix," What a lot of people miss...
","Dear Matrix Viewer,With every highly successful film (especially a film involving the Academy Awards(tm)), there is a backlash some time after release.  There are several reasons for this backlash, one being that people generally don't like what they perceive to be 'too much success,' whatever that may be for a person. Some people seem to feel personally diminished when they witness a great success -- or they compare a film to a personal favorite, rather than viewing it 'in isolation' -- for what it is AS IS, not for what it's judged against.Another reason is that many don't realize a film is *more than the sum of its parts*.  When a movie is first released, this fact is generally recognized, and a movie is enjoyed as a whole.  Later, people tend to pick the film apart, viewing it as *the sum of its parts*, and concluding that because of the perceived faults in various parts, the movie itself can't be so great.  The sense of a film as *the whole banana* gets lost when people pick it apart.Yet another is that people generally get tired of hype.  Many are bothered by commercial hype, and feel that when individuals hype (enjoy/love) a movie, some sort of unforgivable sin has been committed.The psychology of a successful film could fill a book.  Notice how well 'Titanic' was received when it appeared on the big screen -- people were seeing it then as a movie, a whole -- and AS a whole, it's a great film. Later, people saw it as the sum of many different scenes, and so it seemed like a poor film.  It's just too easy to lose the ability to watch a movie AS a movie after it's been around for awhile, and people pick and pick at it, until even the greatest film can appears flawed and generally worthless.Anyway, if you understand some of the psychology behind how films are seen by people due to various factors, it all starts to make sense.  And (perhaps unfortunately) it gets to be quite dull watching the (at first) intelligent comments on a forum like IMDB turn to black and white -- either it's 'the greatest movie ever made' or it's a piece of... well, you get the idea.THINK, people.  And please, try to see how the effects of *time* upon a motion picture operate.  Why a film that was initially perceived as a stunning achievement by both the public and the critics can later be viewed by many as 'lousy,' or alternately become canonized in people's minds as 'the greatest movie of all time.'I still rate The Matrix 10/10.  I still know how to see it as more than the sum of its parts.  I hope you do, too (or will, someday).",9,0,0,4 February 2001
The Matrix," The 'Star Wars' of the 90's
","'The Matrix' is arguably the most imaginative Science Fiction vision ever brought to life on the big screen.  Combine that vision with incredible action, special effects and acting, and you have a movie that transcends its genre.  The Matrix, like Star Wars was in 1977, is 5-10 years ahead of its time.  Is it Science Fiction?  Mythology?  An action film?  You decide. Once again, like Star Wars, I feel that it's a combination of all three. Like Star Wars, it's a perfect 10/10.  And like Star Wars (and Blade Runner), it will become a cult classic in the years to come.  Superlative, imaginative filmmaking.  If you haven't seen it yet, prepare yourself for the ride of your life.",9,0,0,23 September 1999
Casino," Great film, but depressing...
","'Casino' is a great film, but it's a film I can only watch rarely because it's so depressing.  In contrast to the always-entertaining 'Goodfellas,' Casino has the same high production values and excellent acting, but in my opinion the plot is somewhat weaker and it's just so depressing.  The first half of the movie is very entertaining, but once everything starts to go downhill the movie becomes almost painful to watch, and viewing the ending scenes is like being slowly bludgeoned by a sledgehammer.Great job, almost too good.  After developing an affection for these characters, we get to watch them slooooowwwllyyyy deteriorate in their own rot.  The effect is something like watching a loved one die slowly of cancer.Well, I like and admire this movie (and own it on DVD) but I just can't watch it too often.  8/10 -- maybe it deserves a 9 or a 10, but I have to include overall entertainment value in my ratings, especially a picture aimed at mainstream audiences.",8,1,2,5 January 2001
Heat," Fun, but no work of genius
","Here we have Al 'Hoohah!' Pacino and Robert 'Obey me or I'll repeat myself louder' Deniro together in an entertaining crime drama.  In the end, it's really more a collection of interesting scenes than a great work of celluloid (the parts are greater their sum, in this case) but still a lot of fun to watch.  Drags out a bit sometimes and imho could have used a bit tighter editing, but fans of Pacino or Deniro are bound to enjoy this.  A solid 8/10 for cinematic enjoyment.",8,0,0,16 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Childlike vs. childish...
","Apparently some of the reviewers here have mixed up the two concepts, and 'Star Wars' definitely falls into the former category.Someone (I forget who) once said 'The man (woman/person) who has lost the ability to feel a sense of awe or wonder is dead inside.'  Someone else (a well known figure) is reputed to have said, 'Lest you become like a little child, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.'  In 1977, the kingdom of heaven was at hand for the lucky ones who got to see this in the theater.  After waiting hours in a line that stretched 4 or 5 blocks (still the longest theater line I've ever seen), the lights dimmed, and after the words scrolled across the screen (which made sense to few... episode IV?), Darth Vader walked onscreen.  There still hasn't been anything to equal that cinematic moment (I was 13), and probably never will be.Yes, the formula has been copied numerous times... 'Star Wars' (and a few other films both before and after) ushered in a new cinematic era.  Yes, it's somewhat campy and there are cheesy moments... aren't these the films we love the most?  'The Sound Of Music' was immensely popular with the moviegoing public, panned by the critics -- and a paragon of cheesiness viewed with the jaundiced eye of the early 00's.  But 'Star Wars' also has many moments of childlike wonder, from the days when Lucas still had 'beginner's mind,' those days when even Spielberg was willing to take chances... and movies were still movies, not computer-generated fake looking 2-hour commercials for Hollywood (and other products).If you haven't seen 'Star Wars' (or you have, and didn't like it), try to watch it with an empty, fresh mind.  Do you remember the concept... do you remember what it was like to be a child?  If not, you are the walking dead.10/10",10,0,0,8 April 2002
Jackie Brown," Snooze City...
","'Jackie Brown' is one of the dullest movies I've ever seen (actually, I shut it off about 2/3 of the way through, since I wasn't following the story anymore and had no interest in doing so).  A semi all-star cast, with all of the actors clearly 'playing themselves.'  A deadly boring story, little action, and it all goes on for far, far too long.I simply wasn't interested enough to put in the energy required to follow the plot, and so as the film progressed I knew less and less about what was happening.  Despite the 'realistic feel' (which on deeper examination seems carefully contrived), I cared nothing for any of the characters (in fact, I found most of them quite irritating, especially the two detectives) and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen (eventually, almost praying for something interesting to happen).  Unfortunately, nothing did.  There are those who might enjoy this movie, I suppose, but I thought it was a complete dud, about as interesting to watch as plain, unsalted white rice is to eat.  5/10.",5,1,5,16 September 2000
Gladiator," Win one for the gipper...
","Ridley Scott is a much misunderstood director.  His trademark style is to create movies with purposely 'one-dimensional' characters, most of which are not very likeable... and to distance us from them rather than bring them in closer.  The reason he does this is so we focus on the film's (always incredible) atmosphere and (amazing) visuals.Now, some may say this is 'style over substance.'  Not quite right, it is style *AS* substance.  A good example of plain old 'style over substance' is the movie 'The Cell.'  That one is all style, no substance.  Gladiator, Hannibal, Blade Runner, these films are (mostly) all style, but the style *IS THE SUBSTANCE*.  The atmosphere these films create, the way they make you feel in your gut, that is the substance!Is there something wrong with that?  Film is an art form, and who ever said every movie has to tell a deep, complex tale with warm characters we can all relate to?  Sometimes, a film is all about style... it's a visual medium, isn't it?  Do all paintings have to be of people?Many people are never going to appreciate Ridley Scott's kind of directing... it's usually a 'love it or hate it' kind of thing.  Anyway, you finally deserve one of those golden paperweights, Ridley, go grab (at least) one!",Null,0,0,19 February 2001
Contact," Terrific and moving...
","A combination of high concept science fiction and faith, this film is groundbreaking in several ways.  Without the religious/faith elements, it would have been one of the few pure science fiction films Hollywood has released in the past 50 years.  As it is, I like the way the script combines and synthesizes the elements of sci-fi and religion, making each seem more meaningful than it would be by itself -- a fitting tribute to Carl Sagan. It's hard to imagine this film as pure science fiction, but I don't think it would be nearly as entertaining and thought provoking if it were.** Some spoilers **The element of wonder and surprise is, for me, what really made this film. The moment when 'Ellie' walks across the bridge to the spacecraft is one of the most awe inspiring moments in film history -- think of it, risking one's life in an unknown device built for unknown reasons and it will do who knows what?  It's an incredible moment of suspense and wonder.The film gets weaker in the last half hour, after 'Ellie' arrives at her destination.  In retrospect, one can only think that more could have been done with the story, and that what was done could have been done better. However, it doesn't detract too seriously from the film as a whole.  The last few minutes of the film (after the congressional hearing) reveals a 'secret' that vindicates the film, and apparently some other reviewers missed it -- pay careful attention near the film's conclusion, when the presidential advisor is talking by teleconference to the national security guy.  What she says (about the recording made on board the spacecraft) is crucial to the plot, and if you miss it then you miss everything.Overall, this film does an outstanding job at both entertaining and provoking thought -- it's compulsively watchable and rewatchable, and one of the best films of the 1990's.  9/10.",9,2,5,21 March 2004
Donnie Darko," Boring...
","It sure was hell to sit through this movie.  Toward the beginning it was a little intriguing, but quickly degenerated into what amounted to a very bad Stephen King novel (the person reading 'It' toward the beginning was interesting...).  I could imagine King writing something like this, and I can also imagine myself putting it down before getting 1/3 of the way through.The ending made no sense to me whatsoever, other than the fact that 'time went backward' or something, and he had really been killed by the engine (?).  Gosh, how original.  The characters were all dull oppressed zombies, and the final 15 minutes of this insufferable film had to be the most painful of all... this almost became the first movie I turned off *in the last 15 minutes*.Someone commented that you had to have had emotional problems to understand this movie.  Don't think so.  'Pump up the Volume' I liked a lot... this one was a total waste of time.  Can I go back to before I put the film in the VCR and have an airplane engine fall on my head?  Please??Dull, boring, immature and incomprehensible -- will give it 2/10 stars for the attempt at weird, gothic originality.",2,2,5,27 March 2002
The Birds," A disappointing return...
","I've seen Hitchcock's 'The Birds' several times, the last time perhaps 25 years or so ago.  Recently, my brother rented it on video and I decided to watch it again.  I have to say that this film has not worn well with time. The technical ineptitude of the special effects (especially the ever-obvious and oft-repeated still prop with a moving background behind it, as in the view out the rear window of a car as it's 'moving') was a tremendous distraction.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by advances made in special effects, but this was just too distracting - I couldn't help it, I was 'pulled out of the story' again and again by the old-style 'special effects.'  To put it mildly, they stink.  Also, the hitchcockian formula has been copied and copied and copied and copied again... so many times, that it 'feels like' we're watching yet another copy, although it's not the case.  I found myself generally bored with 'The Birds,' although I loved it as a child and young teenager.  It just has not stood the test of time well.  Hitchcock may be a true original, but his imitators have surpassed him at this point in almost every area.  Recognizing the original 'master of the scare,' I gave this movie 7/10... but watching 'The Birds' in the year 2000, not only was I not-scared, I was not even entertained.",7,0,2,10 April 2000
Jurassic Park," Quite Good...
","'Jurassic Park' is an entertaining and occasionally inspired movie directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the novel by Michael Crichton.To my mind this is a very good popcorn flick, with occasional flashes of inspiration. The CGI work, which still holds up decently today, is stunning and groundbreaking stuff for the early 90's. Spielberg directs with a deft hand, and the action never lets up.If I had any complaint, it would be that the acting (except for Goldblum and Attenborough) is merely average -- in particular, the usual weaknesses involved with child actors applies here. Also, the movie is long on popcorn action and relatively short on brains... the subjects of cloning, ecology and paleontology are lightly and briefly touched upon but that's it (if you want more in this area I'd suggest reading Crichton's book, which is quite good).Overall this movie is worthwhile, and easily one of Spielberg's stronger films. Recommended for rental or purchase, kids will love it.",7,3,7,17 April 2005
High Fidelity," Occasional laughs punctuate the boredom
","Yes, I did laugh occasionally here and there... but the fact is that these characters are pathetic.  Rob (John Cusack) is completely possessive/obsessive and self centered, unable to be vulnerable or caring even for a moment -- his string of failed relationships is obvious and understandable, as is his self-pity (he really is as worthless as he feels himself to be).  Nobody (at least nobody I can think of) could like or relate to this guy, or the people he works with at 'Championship Vinyl.'Unfortunately, liking and/or identifying with the characters is necessary in a character-driven film like this... so it becomes an exercise in tedium almost immediately.  Although not without some redeeming qualities, even being a vinyl fan (like myself) doesn't save the picture from its own leaden weight and banal predictability.  6/10",6,1,2,27 January 2003
The Godfather," Doesn't anyone read books anymore?
","Check out a copy of Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather' from the library, or just buy the book (because you will want to anyway).  Lots of people have commented on things they liked or didn't like in the script, not realizing that they are taken straight from Puzo's masterpiece.  As (almost) always, the book is better than the movie.  Please do yourself a favor and pick up a copy somewhere, and if you aren't 'hooked' by the second or third page I would be amazed.One advantage of the book is it goes into much richer and more vivid detail than the film does (a lot of material from the book was used in the subsequent Godfather movies as well -- there's no way a single movie could ever capture that much detail).  It's a delightful and utterly satisfying tapestry.  If it sounds like I'm reviewing the book more than the movie, it's probably because it's a long time since I've seen the film -- but I re-read the book often because it's a work of literary genius and by far the finest work of fiction ever written on this subject.  If you're a fan of the film, please grab the book as soon as you can and prepare to be transported. You won't be able to put it down, and your respect and liking for the film can only grow afterward.",Null,1,3,4 March 2004
