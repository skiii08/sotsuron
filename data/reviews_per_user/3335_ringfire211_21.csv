National Treasure: Book of Secrets," I certainly don't need a Book of Secrets to tell me this one is no good...
","OK, I don't want to spend too much time on this one. The first film was pretty forgettable and this one is no different. Indiana Jones this series is not. This one makes INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL look like a work of art in comparison. Sure it may have some cool chase scenes here and there but the ridiculous things our intrepid heroes do to uncover the various codes/treasures is laugh-out-loud mind-numbingly dumb. Really?? Let's sprinkle our water bottles over some boulders on Mount Rushmore and miraculously clues will appear on said boulders. Who the hell writes this stuff?? Oh well, at least Diane Kruger is kinda hot.",5,0,0,29 December 2011
The Expendables 2," Much better than the first...
","Not gonna lie - I enjoyed it! I definitely recommend seeing it. But only if you are into cheesy 80s actioners laden with one-liners. That's everyone, right? Hehe...Anyway, basically everything that was wrong with the first one is right in this one. Simon West's steady hand in the director's chair really captured the action sequences in all their fluid and gory glory as opposed to Sly's choppy and shaky sequences in the first one. Secondly, the action sequences are more creative this time around and not just endless shootings and stabbings. Thirdly, West seems to understand when enough is enough. OK, sure it's overkill here too - not gonna lie. But compared to the first one this looks like a lesson in moderation. Less is more sometimes. And that's always a good thing. The end battle in the first one was just one huge carnage-fest which looked like something out of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN amped up to the 100th degree and felt like it went on for an hour. I couldn't tolerate anymore of it. Here the end battle shows some creativity and tongue-in-cheek fun as each 'hero' gets to shine and then the 2 final battles are also quick, sweet, and to the point - first between Jason Statham and Scott Adkins and then the grand-finale between Sly and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Great stuff! But the greatest improvement with this film is that it actually succeeds in doing what it sets out to do - mainly to emulate the glory years of the 80s action picture. The first one failed in this department. It's like the cast didn't get the memo that they weren't doing a Chris Nolan film. Like they forgot that they're supposed to be spoofing 80s actioners. So they bring in Academy-award winner Mickey Rourke to give some sob story about some little girl and some such nonsense. Then the whole team sits around pouting with emo faces. Then the action kicks in and we feel like we're in a Bourne movie - hey why is the camera shaking, dammit??! I thought this was supposed to be good violent fun - a COMMANDO 2010 or something like that. Anyway they definitely rectified this here - no shaky-cam, no emo nonsense, no taking things too seriously. Just old-school fun and mayhem! The best parts are the guys sitting around and cracking jokes. Gotta love Arnie and Bruce's extended cameos. JCVD is a total revelation as the 'Vilain' (see what I did there?) - as hissable and vile as possible! Eric Roberts and Steve Austin can go hang their heads in shame. But the highlight has to be Chuck's cameo. Anyone surprised?? Yeah, didn't think so. When Ennio Morricone's TGTBATU score begins to play as Norris emerges from amidst the carnage the theater broke out in applause. I might have even pumped my fist. Can't remember at this stage. Gotta love Chuck not wanting to join the team, saying he's a 'lone wolf', but he keeps popping up like a ghost from behind corners here and there to lend the team a hand. Then he just disappears again. Love it! Best line of the film? Sly to Chuck: 'I heard you got bitten by a King Cobra'. Chuck to Sly: 'Yeah, I did. But after 5 days of excruciating pain... the Cobra died.' The theater burst into a roar of laughter! Hey, we all knew it was coming.Do I need to see the film again? Nah, probably not. Did I have a grand old time?? YA BETCHA!! Not much of a story but it sure was fun and the most fun I had at the movies this year. Which isn't really saying much because I've only been to the theater twice thus far. THE GREY was obviously a much better picture but obviously not as much fun. They weren't exactly aiming for 'fun' with that one.Still, EX2 was much, much better than the first. I give it a solid 8/10.",8,2,5,29 August 2012
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Very enjoyable adventure... but best action film ever?? Nope, sorry.
","I've seen this film countless times and I'm always waiting for that great revelation which jumps at me and screams AMAAAAZING FILM!!! Alas that has yet to happen. Oh it's an enjoyable romp but I'm always teetering between a 9/10 and a 10/10. I guess 9.5/10 is the ideal score for it. And is it crazy that I find UNDER SIEGE 2 more entertaining than this film? Crazy, I know. But anyhoo Harrison Ford is fantastic here and Karen Allen is equally amazing - those two have incredible chemistry! The supporting cast is also great - heck, Paul Freeman eats a fly and then even lets his head explode - what a trooper! Ronald Lacey's face-melt still registers after all these years as well. John-Rhys Davies as Sallah is a great ally - 'Asps. Very Dangerous. You go first'. The action scenes are all great as well. But the real star here is John Williams - you just can't tire of listening to his 'Raiders March' and 'Map Room' - music of the gods if you ask me. And yet it's still LAST CRUSADE that is the really amazing Indy film for me. Ford and Connery. Indy and Bond together. Enough said. But RAIDERS is solid in its own right. Just not quite on the level of CRUSADE.",9,0,1,15 December 2011
Spartacus," I'm a sucker for old sword-and-sandals epics... so this one is right up my alley!!
","Just an all-around classic! Best film of 1960 (no small feat when the competition is Hitchcocks's best film - PSYCHO) and one of the greatest epics ever put on celluloid. Next to BEN-HUR and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS I can't think of another more worthy epic than this one. The cast is to die for! Kirk Douglas is perfect as Spartacus and Jean Simmons has never been better than here as Varinia (although she was also great as Diana in THE ROBE) but the real scene-stealers are the magnificent trio of Sir Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, and Peter Ustinov (who won the Supporting Actor Oscar). Choosing between these 3 is like choosing between your favorite children. Sometimes I really want to say that Olivier is my favorite but it's really difficult. All 3 are great! The battle scenes are some of the best you'll ever see from that time. Heck, there's a scene where a man's arm is hacked off completely. I mean that's BRAVEHEART material right there! But this was 1960! Great stuff. No CGI. Just hordes of men engaging in epic warfare! The interesting thing is that I am not a fan of Stanley Kubrick's. Not at all. But this one is an exception. Probably because it's not really a Kubrick film. Sure he directed it but it's not the type of film that he would normally direct. He was only brought in by Douglas to replace Anthony Mann after Douglas fired Mann. So it's basically a non-Kubrick film directed by Kubrick. And that can only be a good thing. At least for me. Kubrick is a master of the craft but the subject matter he chooses to tackle never interests me in the least. That's why SPARTACUS works so well IMO.",10,3,6,15 December 2011
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. -- what's all the fuss about?
",I dunno... maybe I could pull it up to a 6... maybe. The problem is that the whole affair is just soooo melodramatic and vanilla plain for me. Maybe you have to be a kid to appreciate this one. Though Roger Ebert apparently raved about this one and he was no kid in 1982. Or maybe he was... who knows? Let's just say that John Williams's score is the best thing about it. Amazing piece of music!! Plays in your head long after the movie is over. And I found Drew Barrymore really cute and just plain fantastic in the movie! For a kid her age she was well ahead of the curve. I suppose there are some scenes of genuine Spielberg-ian wonderment on the screen but for most of the movie E.T. just creeps around the house making a mess in the kitchen and making strange noises. I guess I'm supposed to chuckle or go 'Awwwww' at those scenes. Instead I glance at my watch. Overrated.,5,2,6,15 December 2011
In Bruges," Quite good actually... witty script!
","Surprisingly good movie. I rather liked the dark comedy element of the whole thing. The dynamic between Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, and Ralph Fiennes was great. Those 3 really made the movie for me! The movie made me laugh out loud in quite a few spots. Two hit men wandering around aimlessly is not really my type of thing but the script is so clever that you somehow end up marveling at the whole ridiculous story. I never cared much for Farrell as an actor - he always seems to be playing these annoying schmucks - but here he's just hilarious. Especially the way he plays off Brendan Gleeson's character. He is sooooooo bored out of his skull by being in Bruges that you almost feel sorry for him. While Gleeson is taking in the sites and all the architecture that Bruges has to offer Farrell looks like he's about to crack up or lose his mind. He's *that* bored! Hilarious stuff!",8,1,3,15 December 2011
Iron Man 2," Quite a drop-off from the first one!!
","Saw IRON MAN 2 over the weekend and thought it was merely okay. Doesn't come close to the original. And I wasn't exactly going crazy about the original one either. The best part was without a doubt the Monaco race track scene where Whiplash makes his entrance. That scene was, in one word, AMAZING!! Probably the greatest entrance of a villain in any superhero movie that I've seen. And the action that follows was equally brilliant! Unfortunately everything else ranged from merely okay to downright baaaad. Tony sitting in a donut was downright cringe-worthy as was Sam Jackson's lame line about exiting the donut. Hardy-harr-harr.. who the heck came up with that one? And the scene where Tony gets drunk and rowdy at the party immediately reminded me of the scene where Peter Parker does the same thing in SPIDER-MAN 3. Yuck!! And I agree with Roger Ebert - the finale was both overwhelming and underwhelming! Overwhelming because of all those hundreds of drones flying around blasting Iron Man with all the firepower they can muster. How the city stayed intact with all those huge fireballs left and right is beyond me. Much less how lucky can one Iron Man get against a slew of such machines. Even by comic-books standards this is really pushing it. But then we get to the showdown we've been waiting for - Iron Man vs. Whiplash! How long does that last? Oh a few measly seconds. Are you kidding me?! How can you create a climax which isn't even 1/4 as great as the racetrack scene. I wish they scrapped all those drones and gave us a proper ending with Iron Man vs. Whiplash. I mean this ending makes the ending in the original one (Iron Man vs. Iron Monger) look like a masterpiece in comparison. And I actually considered THAT one pretty underwhelming - there's just not too much excitement seeing two metal suits clanging against each other.So yeah I thought this one was a considerable drop-off from the first one. The actors were all good (though I still prefer the acting in the first one) and the racetrack scene was superior to anything in the first film but outside of that the story is really uninteresting and bland. And the ending, as I said, was both overwhelming and underwhelming.",5,4,8,17 May 2010
The Aviator," DiCaprio and Blanchett make this work!!
","I was pleasantly surprised by it. Didn't know what to expect. I was quite impressed with a few of the biopics I've seen - WALK THE LINE, RAY, MIRACLE (that one is more about the Miracle on Ice win but also focuses greatly on the coach Herb Brooks) so I decided to give THE AVIATOR a whirl (ahem). DiCaprio in recent years has proved himself to be quite the actor so I really wanted to see his take on Howard Hughes. Let me tell ya - DiCaprio hit this one out of the park!! By far his best performance!! The mannerisms and all the foibles/compulsive disorders that he brought out in his performance were outstanding!! I immediately went and read up as much as I could about Hughes and his life. I was already a bit fascinated with this man even before seeing the film - although I must admit that my fascination stemmed more from his latter years as a recluse and the fact that Jimmy Dean's Willard Whyte character in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER was based on him. But I had no idea he played such a huge part in aviation and in the film business earlier in his life. That part of his life I knew almost nothing about. And it was DiCaprio's performance that fed my interest in the man even more. Bravo, Leo!! And then there's Cate Blanchett as Kate Hepburn - a maaaarvelous performance!! I was like... DAYUM!!! She IS Hepburn!! Leo and Cate basically made this movie for me. Up until then my favorite lead performances of 2004 were Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks. Both did a splendid job. But sorry... Leo beats them both!!",8,1,2,29 December 2011
The Caine Mutiny," This mutiny did not thrill me...
","I found this one a bit difficult to get through. The court-martial doesn't really come until the end. And even the mutiny itself is all too brief and comes towards the end. So what we end up with is a very talky film for a great portion of its run-time. With a lot of overacting from Bogie and endless talk about procedurals and who stole the strawberries and other such nonsense. And Bogie in particular is being so stubborn and psychotic at times that it's really hard to take him seriously. C'mon, really??! A captain would endanger himself and his crew time and time again just because he's trying to prove a point and will not under any circumstances listen to any sound logic? That's just dumb. And what the heck was up with that subplot about the young sailor and the girl he loves?? Why did that need to be in the film? But the ending with Jose Ferrer and Fred MacMurray is just mind-blowingly dumb and makes zero sense to a person with even a semblance of sound logic. You'll just have to see it yourself to find out what I'm referring to.",5,5,12,29 December 2011
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," I didn't think they could top M:I - GHOST PROTOCOL.....
","Wow! What an exciting thrill ride this film was! I really did not expect this to top M:I - GHOST PROTOCOL, but I think it may have just done that. I'll need to see it again once it comes out on Blu-Ray to make a final verdict. But even if it hasn't surpassed GHOST PROTOCOL it's definitely as good as that film.It's funny how this series started out a bit shaky (it was always a box office success but not always with the critics or even with me) but is now a very solid film franchise. The series really does seem to be getting better and better with each film. After M:I-3 (which seemed like J.J. Abrams was filming an episode of ALIAS for the big screen) I thought it was time to put this series to bed. But with Brad Bird's amazing revelation that was GHOST PROTOCOL and now with Christopher McQuarrie's (who he??) wildly inventive ROGUE NATION, this is a series that is really winning me over and I can't wait to see the next one (and I was never a fan of the film series - I was a fan of the TV series). If they keep up this quality they will be giving the Bond flicks a run for their money (I'm a huge Bond fan, you see).I think making Simon Pegg an integral part of the team (which they did in GHOST PROTOCOL) was a stroke of genius - he and Cruise have fantastic chemistry! It was nice to see Ving Rhames back as Luther (after a cameo in GHOST PROTOCOL) and this beautiful newcomer Rebecca Ferguson is someone to keep an eye on (which surely isn't difficult to do). Sean Harris (someone who is new to me as well) plays the villain in a very understated yet creepy manner - I really liked him. I'll admit that the plot gets a bit confusing - too many twists and turns - but it somehow maintains a high level of suspense and you can't help but really be absorbed by it all. Just an all-around great spy thriller! Much has been said about the plane stunt but what really knocked my socks off was the motorcycle chase!! Wow!! It was one of the most insanely exciting things I've ever seen on the big screen! FAST & FURIOUS - eat your heart out! You'll just have to see it for yourselves to see what I mean.I also cannot fail to mention an early (pre-SPECTRE) sighting of Blenheim Palace in this film - it's the scene of the charity auction where our guys confront the Prime Minister. I recognized it right away! I had seen it previously in 1999's ENTRAPMENT as the place where Connery and Zeta-Jones steal the mask. I look forward to seeing it again this fall in SPECTRE. It's the birthplace of Winston Churchill, you know? Another scene that really stood out was the opera sequence in Vienna. There were shades of QUANTUM OF SOLACE but it was done so much better here in this film - everything from the atmosphere to the suspense to the inventive fights was first rate! By all means drop everything and get your pre-SPECTRE dosage of espionage action right now! You won't be disappointed! I sure wasn't.",10,1,4,2 September 2015
Die Hard 2," Forget the naysayers -- this one is every bit as great as the first one!!
","Maaan!! What a movie!! This movie has been growing on me over the years like crazy. I'm convinced that it's almost as good as the first one. That Renny Harlin really hit it out of the park with this one!! But what really makes this one great?? Snow! Snow! Snow! Lots of snow!! Snowmobiles, snowy runways, icicles, blizzard conditions - makes you want to grab some hot chocolate (or in my case tea) when watching this one.OK, so there is no Alan Rickman. Who cares? You've got Bill Sadler as Col. Stuart whose steely blue eyes look like they could pierce right through your heart! Man, that dude gives me chills! Then you've got John Amos, Franco Nero, and even young Robert Patrick, John Leguizamo, and Vondi Curtis Hall in smaller roles as terrorists! And am I the only one who is still seriously disturbed by the scene where Col. Stuart causes the British plane to crash?? I remember when I first saw it (pre-9/11) I found that scene very disturbing to watch. Now it's even more so. Really makes you root for McClane at that point to tear those bastards apart! The film just works like clockwork! It never lags! Always something crazy is happening! There's just something about Christmas, snow, airports, hustle-and-bustle, and ruthless terrorists that make this a must-see every Christmas! And it has one of the coolest endings in action movie history - you know the scene I'm talking about! The zippo scene! And then the movie finishes off with a brilliant rendition of Jean Sibelius's 'Finlandia' - courtesy of Michael Kamen. Renny's idea!! I think I can now almost say that I prefer DH2 to DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE. Which is no small feat. DH3 is an amazing action picture - with McTiernan back at the helm. But DH2 just feels more faithful to the original - Christmas, terrorists taking over, McClane crawling through ducts/shafts, McClane's wife, Al Powell, Thornburg, pain-in-the-ass bureaucrats, etc! And basically the action being limited to one general location - high-rise/airport.Top marks for one of the top action films of the 90s!! Even Siskel & Ebert agreed. Siskel in particular was ecstatic about it! And Ebert actually said it's better than the first one. That's some high praise!",10,2,4,30 December 2011
Batman Begins," Much better than I initially thought
","When I first saw it back in '05 I was fairly unimpressed. Didn't feel like Batman. Sure it was better than the Schumacher nonsense. Heck, even better than Burton's stuff. But it just didn't feel like Batman. I might have given it a 6/10 at the time. But this time I liked it much more. Maybe I needed to get into the groove of this new Nolan direction. But actually the stuff I liked the most was Bruce's journey. Not so much the superhero stuff. Loved it when he gets back to Gotham and starts putting his new secret identity/new life into motion. And I loved his scenes with Morgan Freeman and the unveiling of the Tumbler Batmobile. Sweet ride! I think the movie gets a bit too hectic and cluttered for its own good towards the end with all the pyrotechnics and madness in the streets but it's the smaller and more personal moments that really drive this movie. Or when Batman does something really wicked cool! Of course Liam Neeson as always is great.",8,0,2,15 December 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," One of the best action films in years!!!
","What a bloody thrilling adventure!! Your assignments, and you all had better accept it, is to check out this amazing film!!!!! Shoot! I'm chomping at the bit to see it again! It is without question the best in the M:I series, without question the best action film of the year, and probably the best film that I've seen since maybe 2007 - that was LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Maybe 2008 with EAGLE EYE. But this is way better than anything in 2009 or 2010 - no doubt about that! I have to give some praise to the score by Michael Giacchino. I especially love the 'Kremlin with Anticipation' track - the first opening bars are basically Lalo Schifrin's work from the 60s TV show. Then it transitions into the Red Army choir and finishes off with the classic 60s main theme by Lalo. All in all a great soundtrack from Giacchino! And I love his rendition of the main theme (the track called 'Light the Fuse') - played during a very cool retro Bondian title sequence. It starts out sounding like something from THE INCREDIBLES and then transitions into the old-school 60s version by Lalo! As for the movie it's basically the perfect template for what a Mission Impossible movie should be. I love MI:2 but there's no hiding that it was more of an action thriller. I'm fine with that because that film (thanks to John Woo) delivered in spades on a visceral action level! But this film really is the best of both worlds - it's both an adrenaline-soaked action movie as well as a movie that strongly homages the classic 60s TV show! Just perfect!! Even Giacchino's music reveals this. Some of the early stuff (especially at the Kremlin) could have been right out of the TV show. I half expected Martin Landau to pop up! Brad Bird (who would have thought?) really got the right combination here! DePalma somewhat missed the mark with the first one - does anyone still know what the first one was about? Very confusing. Woo thrilled me with the second one as a straight-up action movie but it's no secret it didn't feel like a M:I story. Abrams seemed to satisfy some folks with the third one but to me it seemed a bit convoluted and somehow felt like an extended episode of ALIAS or something. But this one really got it right. Very true to the spirit of the TV series (minus the crazy stunts of course but that's par for the course - like Guy Richie's SHERLOCK HOLMES) and very cinematic! Again - very surprised by Brad Bird's accomplishment here! Really... who would have thought? The guy does 3 animated films and suddenly he's given his first live feature - and it's a franchise juggernaut! Damn!! P.S. The stunt sequence at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is worth the price of admission alone. Don't pass this one up, folks! So now let's all get up, power down our computers, and in a single file head down to our local cinemas.",10,8,13,14 January 2012
JFK," Best Oliver Stone film so far!! Have yet to see NIXON...
","Saw this film last week and was very impressed with it.From Costner's performance as Jim Garrison to a stellar supporting cast of such greats as Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Donald Sutherland, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, John Candy (in a rare serious role), Sissy Spacek, etc. All brilliant stuff!! I know Oliver Stone can be a controversial figure but I just think this film ran like a well-oiled machine. It was super-long and yet I didn't feel bored or tired. It sucked me right in. From Robert Richardson's cinematography (which won an Oscar) to the brilliant editing (also won an Oscar) it ran like clockwork. I love the documentary style of filming that Stone employed here. You have clear cinematography interspersed with grainy cinematography, you've got real live footage mixed in with the actors, you've got flashbacks and present day, you've got newspaper clippings and slow-motion shots. Heck, you've got every single film technique employed here and it all works! Plus you've got multiple stories running simultaneously. Love this stuff! You feel like you're right there in the thick of things.Plus this film points out what many people suspected for years and still do - that the JFK assassination was indeed a conspiracy and not the work of some lone gunman. Heck, my parents always maintained it was Krushchev. Others say it was Castro or the mob. Stone (or at least the Jim Garrison character that Costner plays) says it was our own government and the war-profiteering big shots in Washington (perhaps even LBJ himself). JFK was going to end the Vietnam War. So he had to be killed. Same with RFK. Obviously the conspiracies differ - but one thing that most seem to agree on is that it was not the work of a lone gunman named Lee Harvey Oswald. A conspiracy did exist. The Warren Commission Report was indeed very sketchy, to say the least. I'm inclined to believe this as well.When it comes to Stone's films I thought PLATOON was merely okay. Nothing special. Same thing with WALL STREET. I found W. somewhat amusing - probably because of its satirical approach. Josh Brolin was pretty good as Dubya but Dick Dreyfuss was a real hoot as Dick Cheney! Alexander was crap! But JFK is the first Stone film that I'd say was really very good. I am now looking forward to NIXON with Anthony Hopkins. Stone describes JFK as a labor of love (and it shows in the execution) and calls it his GODFATHER. He says NIXON is his GODFATHER II. So I'm looking forward to it. Might need to check out SALVADOR at some point too.By the way, the version I saw was JFK: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. Haven't seen any other versions so I don't know what the differences are.P.S. I forgot to mention the score by John Williams. Amazing piece!! Very atmospheric and effective - both the main theme and the conspiratorial theme.",9,1,9,29 August 2012
Patton," There is only one reason to watch this -- GEORGE C. SCOTT!!!
","Yes, the movie is long. But George C. Scott is such a firecracker in this one that you can't take your eyes off the dude. The man at times seems totally off his rocker and that only adds to the beauty and dynamic of the whole movie. I mean when the war ends Patton says 'All good things must come to an end'. Anybody who says something like that I really gotta know what they're smoking. Seriously, this isn't even a war movie. It's a character study. It's basically the George C. Scott show from first scene to last. And he owns every single frame of every single minute of this movie! You'll rarely find a cinema badass like Scott's Patton. I can't imagine anyone in 1970 who was more deserving of the Oscar than George C.",8,0,0,15 December 2011
Groundhog Day," By faaaaaar Murray's best performance!!
","OK, now I see what all the hoopla is about. A great comedy indeed! Both funny and touching at the same time! Can't believe it took me this long to see it. Easily Bill Murray's best performance and the film is soooooooooo much better than the overrated GHOSTBUSTERS or CADDYSHACK or SCROOGED. Forget about it!! Great film with a genius story - about the same day repeating over and over. Yet the story doesn't bog down or become repetitive as the days begin repeating. Just the opposite. It becomes more and more engrossing. And how about that Stephen Tobolowsky as NED... NED RYARSON!!!! BING!!! I SURE AS HECKFIRE REMEMBER YOU!!! BING!! Hahaha! Truly a great comedy of 1993 - just a peg below MRS. DOUBTFIRE and HOT SHOTS PART DEUX.",9,2,5,29 December 2011
Psycho," The absolute pinnacle of Hitchcock's genius!!!
","My appreciation for this film has really gone through the roof! From the first time I saw it (maybe 8 years back) I knew it was my favorite Hitchcock. But after rewatching and totally being thrilled by NORTH BY NORTHWEST a few months ago I started to wonder if NBNW isn't almost as good as PSYCHO. Well, it's not. This most recent rewatch confirmed it. As great as NBNW is (oh believe me - it's great!!) PSYCHO is that much better. Far and away the best Hitch!! And almost everything that disturbed me about HALLOWEEN and made me look away from it I was drawn into and totally mesmerized by in PSYCHO. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is one of the most brilliant creations in film history! His conversation with Janet Leigh in the parlor is sooooo engaging that you're literally sitting there with your mouth agape. And need anyone say anything about the infamous shower scene?? Plus the B&W cinematography combined with Bernard Herrmann's amazing score really sets the creepy/paranoid mood of the film - sends shivers down your spine. Brilliant stuff!!",10,0,0,15 December 2011
Lord of War," Very good movie about gun-running with a great turn by Nic Cage!
","Another surprisingly good movie. Even though I really can't see Nic Cage as a Russian I thought his performance as the cocky, self-assured gunrunner was fantastic! I also loved his narration throughout the film against the backdrop of the passage of time and the changes in the world's regimes. Just a very good movie on the whole. I also really loved the opening title sequence which showed the life span of a bullet - from the bullet's creation to its final destination (a person's forehead). I thought the supporting cast of Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke, and Bridget Moynahan were all solid as well. The film really does make you think about all the carnage these guns cause around the world.",8,0,0,15 December 2011
Halloween," A really depraved film.... difficult to watch!
","I can appreciate the amount of suspense generated with the small budget and Carpenter really evokes a creepy-as-hell mood with his music but overall the subject matter is absolutely disturbing and depraved and thus a huge turn-off for me. And no I'm not entertained by promiscuous teens (and one that is not promiscuous at all) being hacked to death. I understand that this film must seem fairly tame compared to the blood-curdling garbage being churned out today and indeed I can applaud the fact that very little blood is shown here and that Carpenter relies mostly on suspense to generate terror. Still, it's an uneasy experience and for someone like myself (who absolutely hates the slasher genre) this is a turn-off. Hitchcock's PSYCHO was a masterpiece. This is not.",2,5,12,15 December 2011
Rear Window," Very good Hitch.... but not exactly great
","When it comes to Hitchcock and 1954 I'll take DIAL 'M' FOR MURDER any day over REAR WINDOW. I've noticed more issues with this film this second time around than I did on my first viewing. It's still a very solid movie with that meticulous Hitchcock touch in every scene - the way Hitch's production team recreated that whole apartment complex on the back lot and the classic camera movements of cinematographer Robert Burks. But I was a bit less impressed with it this time around and I noticed some guffaws that I didn't notice before. The film actually feels a bit too long - especially for a film which consists of a single set and of a guy sitting in a wheelchair and spying on his neighbors for the entire run-time. I mean it has the run-time of your typical Bond film. I think 30 minutes could have easily been cut and it would have made for a tighter picture.Then there is the rather far-fetched idea that a girl like Grace Kelly is basically throwing herself at the feet of Grampa Jimmy Stewart who is just a sour puss and wants to do nothing but look through his binoculars the whole day. I really didn't notice this laughable concept the first time around for some odd reason. I mean just one look at Grace Kelly would have cured me immediately. Voila!! Leg instantly healed!! But this old geezer just wants to lounge around his rear window.Then there is the laughable scene with Raymond Burr taking like 5 minutes to reach Jimmy Stewart who is sitting like 7 feet away in his wheelchair. Burr takes a step... then... BAM... a flash goes off... Burr stops... rubs his eyes... takes another step... BAM... flash goes off again... Burr stops... rubs his eyes. Hey buddy, listen, how about just lunging at that helpless cripple instead of doing this laughable Frankenstein's monster/mummy walk? And then there is the really laughable sped-up footage near the end as the cops rush over to help Jimmy Stewart - like in an old silent movie. And the ludicrous way in which Jimmy falls out his window. I swear that was a howler!! Hahaha!!Had it really been that long since I saw this film last? I don't remember it being such an unintentional comedy. Needless to say FRENZY has now taken the #5 spot in the Hitch pantheon and I guess REAR WINDOW is now at #6. I guess it seems like I'm bashing this film. It's just that for some reason I saw many more goofs this time around and for such a masterpiece that's one goof too many. I still think the film has a wonderful look and an amazing set. The spying of the neighbors is very well done. Grace Kelly is to die for!! And Jimmy is good as always. I just didn't buy into their romance (or lack thereof). Even in the suspense department I think Hitch has done much better in other films.",8,0,2,15 December 2011
The Birds," Seriously... not enough praise for this gem!!
","It's easily a TOP 3 Hitchcock film for me! PSYCHO is easily my favorite. With NORTH BY NORTHWEST and THE BIRDS duking it out for 2nd place. Everyone raves about VERTIGO (way overrated) and REAR WINDOW (good but not great) but it's THE BIRDS which is easily the most underrated film of the Master of Suspense! Forget VERTIGO. THE BIRDS is a true masterpiece! What's really amazing about the film is that we're never told why the birds attack. They just do. And they do it in stages. No one knows why. Is it Tippi Hedren's arrival in Bodega Bay? Is it just some strange coincidence? Is it Mother Nature? Nothing is more terrifying than that which we do not understand. This film really delivers! Who can forget that scene where Tippi sits smoking on a bench as the birds slowly gather on the jungle-gym behind her? When she finally looks back she's terrified to see the jungle-gym completely covered in a black cloud of birds!! But just think about the sheer guts that Hitch must have had to undertake such a daunting task as this film! I mean how do you film a movie with a swarm of killer birds pecking folks to death? And all without CGI! Using live birds!! Sheesh... if I were a director I would have said 'no thanks' without even giving it a second thought. How do you do a movie where the villain is a bird? Not one bird. Hundreds of them. Thousands of them.Sure you have a good deal of rear-projection shots. But you also have shots of real birds tied to the actual kids who are running for their lives. Each shot has to be carefully scrutinized. You have a combination of real birds & fake birds, rear-projection, various camera tricks and cuts, an exhausted Tippi Hedren who wound up in the hospital from all this, etc. The whole undertaking really does make your jaw drop! And it's not just merely a novelty item (just some ground-breaking special effects movie) it really has that genuine terror and suspense that Hitch's best films possess. Only PSYCHO is superior to this one in terms of terror/suspense! It's not something like AVATAR where it's all just a commercial to show off the latest in Hollywood SFX. It's a genuine horror film!!",10,3,6,15 December 2011
