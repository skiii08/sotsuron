Black Swan," What's the fuss about? Possible spoilers
","I finally caught this today, and I really don't see the fuss. As full disclosure, I didn't see any of the other Best Actress movies, so I cannot say who deserved to win, but I was incredibly underwhelmed by NP's performance. Natalie's expressions were Stressed and More Stressed. Oh, and Paranoid. Not a lot of range in this. With all the accolades, I was expecting to be blown away. I felt like I was watching NP play an obsessed (and mentally-ill) ballerina. Portman came off as very aware of this being an Oscar-bait role, and thus the performance never seemed organic. As note: MAJOR props to the special effects team. I enjoyed Nina's visual transformation near the climax from the White Swan features to the Black Swan. As for the story, I expected more. It was dark, but based on reviews, I expected something more disturbing and maybe unusual? I did turn away from certain parts, such as the breaking legs and bloody feet scenes as things like that make me queasy. Based on my one viewing, it seemed to be a study on mental illness. Shades of Fight Club and Memento(both are superior), but without soul and genuine intrigue. I don't mind a movie left to the viewer's interpretation, but this movie made sure everything was up in the air. This movie asked for a lot of assumptions. We never saw Beth (Winona Ryder) dance. So it's unclear why (aside from being the prima) Nina idolizes her. We never see the other ladies audition, so Nina winning the part could really be a result of the director's creepy fixation on her than of talent. We don't see what makes Thomas' 'visceral' Swan Lake so unique, in terms of how much of the actual performance we see. All we're watching is Nina's descent into further madness, which is fine, but I expected the climax to consume more of the run-time. I don't need anything spelled out, but the way the movie left things felt obnoxious and lazy. On the other hand, could all the light/dark/black/white have been more obvious? I've never seen Swan Lake, but based on what I've read, this was a perverted interpretation. The gratuitous sex scenes were cheap (Monster's Ball cheap) and did not move the plot. Even Portman commented on how the scene w/Kunis was how you get people in the theater. The old train pervert served no purpose.I was hoping the movie would show appreciation for ballet, but it didn't, and I'm not a dancer. 127 Hours showed both the wonders and the dangers of nature, for example. The dream sequence in Oklahoma was a better tribute to ballet. Then again, two characters did talk us through the storyline of Swan Lake, so I guess that should have been a clue that we wouldn't 'see' it.Another thing that bothered me was we're to believe that Nina is obsessed about being the Swan, but she doesn't seem obsessive about anything else. Not asking for much, but something as simple as having to brush her hair w/100 strokes every night or some OCD-type habit. Don't think the vomiting applies b/c I think that was stress- related. I guess self-mutilation would work, as stated earlier, anything with blood or if I felt blood/peeling skin/etc coming, I looked away. Plus, this was not done in the open, so I feel they could have added something that other characters saw. The couple of 'mean girl' ballerinas in the beginning of the film seemed like perfect candidates to hone in on some quirk of Nina's that would point to her problem. How is it that her obsessiveness is so contained? If gratuitous sex could be added, then surely, Aronofsky could have developed Nina more. Mila Kunis' character wasn't as fleshed out as I expected which leads me to believe that Nina imagined her. I believe the movie was about Nina's disturbed psyche brought on by her repressed childhood/adulthood and it culminated into her killing herself. She had a mom that was trying to live through her and she had that internal struggle of not being good enough in a highly competitive profession. Another review pointed it out, but what in the world was with the mother's drawings? It was weird seeing them the first time, but when we see them again, they're animated? Unless I blinked, Nina never brought them up to her mother. Are we to believe that with at least 40 drawings in that room, Nina has never seen them? Really?As a superficial observation, Natalie Portman is only 30, but looked a lot older. I get the reasons for her weight loss, but visually, it did her no favors and she came across quite harsh on screen. NOT attacking Natalie, but she looked no younger than Winona which made it somewhat unbelievable that Nina's supposedly this great dancer, but has yet to have a leading role at her age. I can't remember if they said how old she was, but anything other than 29/30 is not believable. Certainly not at a peak age which I hear is early 20s. The ending was a letdown. When Nina said 'I felt it...It was perfect...That was perfect.' (complete with a smile), my ears actually heard ' All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.' So cheesy. Probably won't watch again as it didn't live up to the hype. Mulholland Drive might be a better movie. In fact, Summer Glau as a tortured ballerina dancing 'Giselle' ('Waiting in the Wings' episode of Angel) exhibited more emotion, intrigue, and coherency.",Null,1,1,8 October 2011
Memento," Finally saw it. Good movie
","I didn't really 'get' the movie until afterwards when I started reading some of the IMDb reviews and board comments. I had heard that the film was done 'backwards' but it didn't really click for me until I read a bit more. The movie is engaging and it makes you wonder what's going to happen next. In terms of the climax, lots of things cleared up by the time the blacknwhite (forward) and the color (backwards) met up. That's when the movie really started making sense.There were some gross moments that turned my stomach, but other than that, the violence was tolerable. It wasn't as bad as I was expecting.Oh,since I did mark it spoiler, I believe that the cop was telling the truth about everything. For a few reasons, one of which was Lenny's memory of giving his wife an insulin shot. By the end, it seemed to me that he made up the story about Jenkins in order to 'deal' with his role in his wife's death. And then his monologue at the end where he pretty much set up the cop so that he would be the one he went after was creepy. Lenny was pretty dangerous, and if this were real life, it would be scary for someone like him to actually be on the loose.",Null,0,3,15 February 2010
500 Days of Summer," It wasn't horrible, but an average rating of 8 is excessively generous.
","I would give it between 5/6 out of 10. The movie was very watchable, kept my interest, had a cool filming style, but I just felt meh about it. First: the acting. Now I remember as a kid going to see JGL in 'Angels in the Outfield,' so he's an actor that while I'm no huge fan, I'll watch his movies. He's charming in the role of a love-sick, naive young guy. I especially got a kick out of the dancing scene. A totally random scene, but it reminded me of how occasionally when we are extra happy, we start dancing. In our rooms, in the copy room at work..sometimes we just get happy. As for Zooey D, I don't see her appeal. I don't seek out her movies, but every movie I've seen her in, she's a quirky, flakey, Mary Sue. Is it always the role or is some of it her real self poking through? I don't know. However, it reminds me of Drew Barrymore....she just has a ditzy quality that gets tiresome when it's in every movie I see that she happens to be in. I also didn't find her to be the best-looking lady in the movie, so all of the intro in the beginning about her was a bit hollow. I thought the redhead blind date was much more attractive even if she had 5 mins of screen time. This plays into the Mary Sue aspect of Summer's character. As for the story, it was clear that the movie would end up being about how he got over Summer. OK fine, I was looking forward to that. However, the execution left a little to be desired. Tom definitely allowed himself to be used by Summer, however, I'm of the opinion that had she gone beyond her initial 'I don't want a relationship,' and nipped everything completely in the bud, he would have gotten the hint. Summer had zero redeemable qualities in my eyes. She definitely used his feelings to her benefit, and if the roles were reversed, Tom would be the quintessential jerk. She was highly manipulative and she just strung him along. Something was definitely wrong with her in that she was OK using him KNOWING his feelings w/her. It was easier to identify with Tom and all his ridiculous naivety bc he was emotional. We knew his motivations, but did not know hers. When I watch movies, whether I like characters or not, I feel writers should give us inclinations as to their motivation. Note: this doesn't make them likable, it just makes them more understandable. There's absolutely no reason to act 'relationship-y' with a person whom you KNOW wants it when you don't. After a fight where the guy/girl is upset bc he feels that you're in a relationship but you won't admit that it kinda is....only a girlfriend/boyfriend figure goes over to that person's house in the middle of the night and sleeps with them. Not a person who wishes to have boundaries. None of her behavior said 'friends.' The part of the movie that killed it for me was when she got married and told Tom that with the new hubby 'she was sure of what she wasn't sure of w/Tom.' *Cue head scratching* So was that a throwaway 'insightful' line or was she lying when she said she didn't want a relationship? She got married very soon after she met Tom, so w/that scene, the writers negated a lot of personality and just made her a completely unlikeable character.The ending was a bit cheesy, but whatever. It's a decent movie to pass time, but you'll probably leave with the same 'meh' feeling I did.",Null,19,32,19 September 2010
Twilight," Not as bad as I thought, but not great. Chock full of problems
","OK, count me in the number that could stand to never see the whole Twilight franchise again. It's everywhere: web ads, bookstores, fricken Nordstrom. It's been very hard to avoid everything Twilight. So last night, it was on Showtime On Demand, and I decided to finally watch.First off, Kristen Stewart's Bella was incredibly deficient in the personality department. Did she have a lobotomy? I mean, granted, it's been 8 yrs since my teen stage (I'm 26), but good grief, her perpetually depressed and moody face bugged me. We had Emo kids in my high school, but even they could crack a joke every now and then. She literally had no presence. In my high school, she would have been the new kid for a day, but nobody would have talked to her bc she looked so depressing. It was hard to believe that there were guys already crushing on her. Why? She wasn't all that nice to anyone, she barely talked, the friends she had, the relationships seemed more one-sided than anything.Next Edward. I will say that RP is a nice looking guy, but all the fangirl (not just teen girls, either) swooning is a real turnoff. Anyway, when Edward first came on screen, I had high hopes, but when he actually spoke, I was like 'um, is he slow?' It was as if he had a speech impediment. I had to rewind it to hear it again, and then proceed to laugh. Edward was also a bit of a stalker. I guess if I were 14, I would be turned on by his behavior, but being an adult, I'd be concerned about why he was following me places. And don't get me started on how he admitted he likes watching her sleep.Which brings me to another point. I get that the author wrote the novel based on a (obviously Fabio-esquire)dream she had, but she played way fast and loose with the vampire details. Perhaps the fact that the guy in her dream was a vampire was secondary. I literally asked my friend 'OK, are they vampires or some type of animals?' The pale faces weren't enough. I could not believe that it wasn't clear that they were vamps. Then when I saw they didn't have fangs...WTF!! And they must be the only set of 'vamps' that don't combust when out in the daylight. The sparkle was SO CHEESY. I know I'm giving spoilers, but 1.I marked the review w/the spoiler tag and 2.if you like vampire-based stories, you will be sorely disappointed. Back to my point, when Bella discovers what Edward is, he gets all serious and they focus on his face, but he reveals no fangs!! WTF! Fangs are so basic to vampires. Then I read a reviewer that says they don't have them? Is this for real? The baseball game...come on. What fun is it if you can just fly and catch the ball. Cheesy. BTW, the whole family structure was a tad creepy. The conflict lasted probably 15 minutes and was over so fast. It's less of a vampire story and more of a teen angst/Degrassi-style movie.And don't get me started on Bella wanting to be turned after her association with Edward nearly gets her killed and she's only known him a couple weeks!!Someone else had it right: they seemed less like vamps and more like supernatural creatures. If they could walk into anywhere uninvited, didn't burst into flames, can't be staked, etc etc, then what makes them scary? Since when are vampires nice? Even back on Buffy, Angel became Angelus and Spike w/his chip still had his bad boy tendencies. More recently, Damon on Vampire Diaries is straight up evil and doesn't make excuses for himself. Stefan, his brother, is also part of this neutered dog trend (like Edward) which is quite ridiculous if they are supposed to be vamps.So watch the film (for free on TV) but keep your expectations low. Just think of it as a teen flick NOT a vampire flick, and you should survive. Before I forget, that bluish-tinted filter that Twilight was filmed in was awful. Just awful. It almost hurt my eyes. Sometimes that adds effect to the film/show, but not when it's that noticeable. It was almost as if it was done to make all the characters seem even more pale and emo. Horrible.",Null,5,6,9 February 2010
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Obsession is not love...sorry kids
","And grown a-- women who should know better. I watched New Moon last night via Netflix. That was the only way I would watch it bc I would never have paid for a ticket. From the beginning of this series, the hype killed any interest I had in it. The actors were everywhere. Teens went nuts, women my age (27)-nuts, women my MOM'S age went nuts. It just killed any plans I had to see it. First movie I didn't watch til this year during our blizzard. As I said, I watched NM last night and it was bad. I'm a fan of Buffy, Angel, some Anne Rice, heck, I even liked that weird Jim Carrey vampire movie from before he became a star, but Twilight just bugs me. The second time around, the sparkling faces *still* don't do it for me. I'm no big fan of 'Edward,' but even he looked worse in this movie. 'KStew's' range of emotions *still* consisted of Emo and More Emo. Out of the three, Jacob did the best acting bc he was the only one I hoped survived. He might have a future in Hollywood if he can get away from this franchise. Also, he and Edward had more chemistry than Bella had w/either one of them. Even in the last movie, the tension between them was palpable. The script was humorless which is pretty sad for a teen movie. It's obviously a moody film, but there was no typical-teen sarcasm or anything like that.The story: it was utter garbage. No plot, no action, no suspense. I cringed through the entire movie. I only kept it on otherwise, it would have been a waste of my free trial. Anyway, I'm a person who can watch movies ranging from Citizen Kane to My Man Godfrey to Memento to The Hangover and enjoy them all. I'm not pretentious with entertainment, so I was honestly hoping that the series would have found a groove and improved once the 2nd movie appeared. Not so. It's still the same overly hormonal teenage stuff. It's funny because I'm an 80s baby so we had Clueless (loosely Shakespearean), Can't Hardly Wait, 10 Things (also Shakespearean), Scream, and many other teen flicks. These millennium kids have Twilight. They're getting gypped. Edward was a vision for a good chunk of the movie which suited me just fine; however, his absence caused Bella to have screaming fits at night (see: obsession). She gets closer to Jacob during this time doing pretty normal teenage stuff: motorcycles, movies, etc. She even embraces warmth. ((Which honestly, even in a fluffy movie like this, had so much potential. It would have been much more interesting if the story was written in a way that Jacob ACTUALLY had a chance. Her line: 'Don't make me choose bc it would be him, meaning Edward, pretty much killed any chance for a believable triangle.)) That goes to hell once Ed's 'sister' returns and you just see a regression in Bella's character. She becomes more obsessed with Edward than before. She disses Jacob who actually helped her during the time she was depressed.Which also begs to question: what is it that draws these guys to such a downer type of girl? I mean, she's so BLAH. Edward, OK yeah, I can see it, but Jacob could do so much better. He has a nice family, nice future sis-in-lawdude, get away from this moody girl.Disclosure: I skipped over the entire part of the movie in the temple structure or whatever. Once Edward came back, Bella started talking about turning again, and I lost interest. The only reason she wanted to turn was because she had nothing else going for her, which is pretty sad for a girl of only 18. I guess this makes me part of 'Team Jacob' but that's more because there was no obsession there. Her 'love' for Edward was pure obsession not based in any type of reality. She's being hunted because of him. I totally understandwho wouldn't want to be w/someone whose presence makes them a target? //total sarcasm.As for the effects, the CGI was better this time, but still obvious. I did like the werewolf scenes. Edward and Bella also did a good bit of mumbling; I shouldn't have to turn my volume to 50 or read lips to figure out what's going on.When the movie ended, I said 'that's it?' I had no desire to see Eclipse. In fact, I went ahead and read the plot on Wikipedia just so that another Netflix movie wouldn't be wasted.",Null,7,9,2 September 2010
