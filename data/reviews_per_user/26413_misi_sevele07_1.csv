The Sound of Music," Best Classic Musical, You'll remember no matter how old it is.
","The Sound of Music in my opinion is the best family movie of all time. About a nun name Maria, who is sent to become a governess to 7 kids of the Von Trapp family who only has a father who has lost his wife. This is one movie I can still remember watching in my young days. Watching it over again with the family, you will remember those old tunes you might have sung back when you were still a young boy/girl. The Sound of Music is a really enjoyable movie which I highly recommend to watch with family or friends. I think young adults who have watched The Sound of Music before in their young days, and now have kids and family, they will watch the movie and will remember all the lovely and wonderful songs they use to listen or sing along to. Julie Andrews was just really perfect for the role of Maria, especially Christopher Plummers as Captain Von. Trapp, and also the children. This movie has family, music and love. Even though the movie has been around ever since 1965, the movie is still really popular and well known and its nearly 50 years ago when it was made. The movie gets known every year as young kids watch it while growing up and then they show it to their kids when they have a family, which makes the movie more popular. Overall the Best movie of all time, which will never get old and will never be forgotten.",10,2,8,2 February 2014
