It," poor script, clichÃ© jump scares re-writing of the great story :(
","I read this book back in the 80's. Tonight I saw yet another film adaption of the same book. Once again they miss the mark with yet another Stephen King Classic. I'm not going to say it was a terrible flick. Because it wasn't. It had some redeeming qualities. The humor of Richie 'the mouth' Tozziur was, in fact, the only thing that actually 'Floated' down here. The biggest drawback was the rewriting of the story to suit the uncultured minds of millennials and others who have never read a Stephen King Book. They took what was one of the most imaginative scary stories of the last 50 years and turned it all into a Hollywood clichÃ©. complete with non-stop Jump Scares that scare no one but teenagers. The casting was world class, but the script falls short and turns great dialog into nothing more than a group of kids insulting each other for 2 hours. And the strongest character in the movie ended up being 'The Denzel in distress' routine. AGH so typical.... So boring. so clichÃ©, SO Predictable... Then There's the worst part.... Pennywise actually manages to capture the members of the losers club and yet... HE LETS THEM ALL GO... MORE THAN ONCE... WTF???? It's so clichÃ© and brain dead in this aspect that the more I ponder how ridiculous it was, the more I begin disliking this movie. It lived in the sewers, the reason it comes out of the sewers is because it is a hunter. It hunts because it's hungry. It doesn't hunt for the thrill of scaring little children. It hunts because it is hungry and loves the taste of blood. Predators don't capture and release their prey if they are hungry, They kill them and eat them. But what I will never under stand is the role reversal of some of the main characters. WTF? Am I the only person on this earth who has bothered to read these books? My only guess in switching the love interest from Ben and Bev, to Bill and Bev is because America's obsession with hating overweight people could never accept the fact that the 'Fat Kid' could be the main character and the 'hero' who gets the girl.Then There's Mike's character... They sure didn't want to give the black guy too much screen time. and then they also switched his character with Ben... WTF? Ben was not the Town History buff... Guess they just want to make Ben the biggest loser by making him the one who stays behind in the town? Is it too much for the millennial mind set of 'Survival of the cutest' to grasp that people who aren't 'pretty' are also people of value too?Who knows? But why rewrite the god damned story? There's a reason why Stephen King sold millions of copies of this book:Because he's a great story teller and is considered to be one of the finest of the last 50 years.... so what ego driven Hollywood executive decided the script writers of this adaptation had better vision than the already tried and true hit making story?Out of five stars, I reluctantly give it 3. However, it does not deserve 3 stars. it deserves 2 out of 5. I only rate it three because of the humor of Richie and because the parts that did stick with the story looked great, the casting was great and the Clown was a million freaking times scarier than that stupid Tim Curry that was laughable at best from the 90's adaption.",5,43,81,7 September 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Disappointing
","Spoiler Free Quick Summary: There are many Flaws in Star Wars Last Jedi. Some of it was really fun. Some of it flat out disappointed. Some of it felt like exploitation of the franchise, while other parts felt like they had a heart and paid good homage. 
The fact is, 'It just didn't feel like Star Wars' felt more like a Marvel movie. Which I don't see as a good thing. They need to cut about 45 minutes from the film and stop 'Plot twisting' to shock the audience. Sticking to the rules of the Star War lore would also help the situation. And The CG over practical effects kinda smashes the whole idealism as to why the Force Awakens was deemed acceptable and the last Jedi as another tool to make quick cash. Too long too much and too Disney not enough Star Wars.
6 out of 10 stars.More in-depth Review :Glad I went. A little disappointed.... But glad I live in a world where there is a Star WarsThere were some really great moments in the film. But there were some really disappointing aspects too. It had nothing to do with the breaking of fan theories or any of the trivial chatter that makes up a review by fanboys. The film fell flat due to the STORY (or lack thereof). What was presented here did not seem on par with the lore of the other 7 films in the saga. It's downfall had a little more to do with the way The last Jedi was STRIPPED of the royal treatment the force awakens was given. Honestly, The perfect ending for the Star Wars story should have been The Force Awakens. Perhaps it should have just ended there. But that's not what happened. The Last Jedi seemed, empty of all that care. A lot of CG rather than practical effects. It reminded me more of one of the prequels in its style. It just didn't hold up. No one wanted to like this movie as much as I did. At times I felt there were so many Disney injustices that I half expected the characters to break out into song like in a bad Disney musical. It is almost like the filmmakers themselves were having the same inner demon battles as Kylo Ren. As if there were two films on display. One that paid respects to a really cool franchise (light side) and one that Exploited it for cash (dark side) 
As if Director Rian Johnson was struggling with the film he wanted to make vs the film that the giant conglomerate Disney was forcing him to make. In this instance. JJ Abrams would have had the clout to say 'Screw you guys I'm going home' and walk away from the project if the Disney dictation got too influential in the filmmaking project. Whereas Rain is obviously more easily persuaded by the dark side. Much like the Snoke / kylo relationship. Snoke manipulating Kylo to do the deeds of the Dark side. Rain seems manipulated by the corporate workings of the Disney Money Machine.A possible case of Career over quality?
And to me, this marks not just a striking blow to the heart of Star Wars. But also to the heart of Hollywood and the people who love quality films, over junk food Cable tv productions, that seem more the speed of Rain.",6,0,0,15 December 2017
