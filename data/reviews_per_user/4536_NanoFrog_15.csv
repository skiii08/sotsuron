Moneyball," For the billions who find baseball boring
","For the several billions of people who find baseball the most boring sport in history, this film very cleverly and with grace shows how baseball was made even more boring, using science. Brad Pitt, really, the entire cast is very good, very good. Brad Pitt could do a movie about the making of the first cereal box and it would probably be great. Brad Pitt as the leading character takes us inside the psyche of a very unique manager of corporate assets, which is what a baseball team is at the bottom line. The dedicated dinosaurs he must contend with are expertly played by a great cast, they seem like real sports managers, and perhaps they are. Hoffman does a great job of acting as an immovable object, and he does it with a minimalist approach that is really convincing and artful. In the end the boring sport of baseball plays back field to dreamers pushing at their dream against formidable forces of public opinion, corporate pressure and certain failure. The story transcends the sport of baseball and shows us what might happen when we open up to change and stand our ground. On a good day, Mickey Mantle would have approved, which is probably why the film opens quoting the legendary ball player.",9,2,5,18 December 2011
Lone Survivor," Fidelity to the incredible stress of modern warfare
","I was a combat soldier in the Vietnam conflict. The first thing that comes to my mind watching this film was the equipment used by modern soldiers. In Vietnam we had the clothes on our back, just underwear and shirt, pants, boots, and our weapon. Some soldiers wore 'flack vests' but where I served with a small unit in the jungles of the south, I never saw that. It was just your weapon and the clothes on your back. As to the story, it raises from the very beginning all sorts of moral questions. The film opens with actual footage of the over the top training and stress imposed on elite fighting units such as the Navy Seals. We see signs right from the beginning of the film that such severe and brutal training regimens set up a trauma and stress situation inside the emotions and lives of soldiers. There is a critical point in the film where the choice to kill 'innocent' people or not to kill them changes everything that happens later. A lot of people will argue about what the choice should have been, and how it might have changed the soldiers chances of survival. That moment is a key to understanding what comes after in the film.Field Command Incompetence. Another issue defined, if not focused upon directly, is how often the field command, Colonels and up, what are called 'field' officers, seem to be incompetent, arrogant and often ineffective. Recent published studies of the history of military service of American Generals, for example, show us that the field commanders of armies on the ground is often a tragic disaster.Emotions. Like many who watched this film, I found the long combat sequence very riveting and yet repulsive, in that they are hard to watch. There are several sequences that caused me to have a strong emotional reaction and I had a lot of tears on my face by the time it was over. There is a point in the film where we see a photo of the soldier who survived (Whalberg's character) with the Afghanistan man who gave him 'hospitality' and saved his life at a great cost to his village. It is very well acted by an very talented Middle eastern actor. It is very easy in this film to become angry about the bad people that are represented by the Taliban fighters. It is easy, honestly, to just become very angry about all Muslims everywhere in a film like this. Suddenly, right in the middle of this intensity of revulsion towards 'terrorists' there is an incredible emergence of human dignity, beauty, that lifts the film upwards, that changes the whole narrative of the film from soldiers captured inside a desperate fight to stay alive, toward the greatest attributes of human society; that of respect and refuge, of personal honor and dignity even in the face of the most terrible events.The film was executive produced by Whalberg, who also stars as the 'Lone Survivor', and you can see in his performance and from the credits that roll at the end of the film, that he was very invested in this story. While it is a sort of 'classic' Hollywood soldier story, the film has many surprises. It is incredibly effective at showing us, using dramatic events, the stress and trauma a modern soldier fighting the 'war on terror' endures over a short period of time in their lives, one that leads to suicides and many other problems for our returning veterans; not to mention the villages and lives changed forever in Afghanistan and the other locations where this kind of warfare continues to this day. I think this film does a much better job at showing this dangerous stress than most other films; but this also makes the film hard to watch. This is a very mature film, very violent. The violence is showed inside of an honest context, but viewers should be prepared for a highly emotional and violent film experience.",8,221,267,16 March 2014
Star Trek," The maker of this film understands nothing at all about Star Trek.
","Garbage. This director understands something, but it is not Star Trek. The movie that is here is a shallow and misguided journey into the ego of the director. There are to many people in this film, the violence is gratuitous and contributes nothing to the story. The actor playing Spock is good as an enraged 'hero' but unbelievable as a Vulcan. There is no character development at all. There seems no context for the characters and no context for the story. The so-called 'spectacular' effects are overblown. The real appeal of the Star Trek series has been the characters, not the explosions. Maybe if the director had a name instead of initials, there might have been a story here. In effect, this production team has killed the series for good. Hollywood has lost the soul of making good science fiction. People who appreciated the humanity and aesthetic of Rodenberry will find this film insulting. I found this release to be a complete waste of time.",1,57,240,8 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Why no story?
","Not sure i understand why writers today, for Hollywood films, just cannot write (or perhaps get approval and money) for an actual good story? While the cast is immensely pleasing and the effects nearly perfect, there is just no story here. This inability of film-makers to actually produce these special effects films which also contain at least an interesting story is a great curiosity to me. If one were a student of Marvel comics, you might recall the many great stories that the writers made around their characters. There is a great emptiness, a gratuitous over- stated violence about this film that is sad, given the audience and potential for this film.",2,12,23,10 May 2010
World War Z," One of the worst films ever made
","As of this review, this film has an unbelievable 7.1 rating. It makes me loose faith in humanity, this rating. This is a movie that is just terrible. Only the star power of Brad Pitt could have moved people to not just walk out of this film. All zombie movies have the same plot really; people become infected with a 'virus' and become zombies. The heroes find a way to survive and somehow save themselves. Stop. In this vein, the film is like all the others. The only remarkable feature of this film are spectacular views of tens of thousands of zombies attacking the world's major cities. The zombies themselves are detailed and quite good at being zombies. Only zombies in fact will like this film. Brad Pitt is flat, passive, detached, calm and boring beyond belief. Every actor is disposable. The final scenes where Pitt's character figures out 'the answer' is mildly clever. The fact that he is some sort of soldier (we are never clear on just who he is actually) and that he figured what all the world's sciences could not is just not believable. A lot of money was spent on mediocre special effects, almost nothing on acting. It is a plain vanilla zombie film without a single redeeming moment and quite childish. This film demonstrates why famous actors should never be producers or directors.If it has any success it is because it shows us why this is almost always true. That more than one non-zombie human being could have found this film rated above a '1' is just incomprehensible to me. maybe the zombies are already here and writing reviews and making films.",1,3,12,15 September 2013
Public Enemies," Empty, distant and very poor film
","From the strange photography to the terrible acting, to the emphasis on personal violence, this movie gives no glamor to Dillenger or to anyone else. the mythology of Dillenger and Pervis goes into complete outer space, none of these characters are shown with any depth or reason. the gratuitous violence seems to make some sadistic point no emphasized in the story itself. Overall, this is a famous story made obscure, an intense moment in USA history made vulgar, and characters who could be interesting made into one-liner punks. Of all the remakes made of classic American gangsters, this is about the poorest effort I have ever seen.",2,2,6,12 July 2009
American Sniper," Tragic Picture of a lost human being
","In the film, good acting and a scrip grant a nobility and a personality to the man who is the subject of this misguided film...qualities he did not possess in real life. I read his book, or tried to. In its pages I found an arrogant and empty person. In the end he disappeared the way he lived. The director in this case does not himself have enough depth of character to understand that this seems to be a picture of a loser. I was a soldier in Vietnam. I was a medic, not a sniper. I never met a sniper. I can only hope they are not like this guy. So many films about America's present wars show us a troubling picture of soldiers disconnected from their lives, not very interested really in their country and completely unable to understand the 'others' they face in these conflicts. Some people view this empty man as some sort of hero, apparently. I do not. I could not finish his book. I just could not relate to this empty person. It is difficult to believe that the story teller in this case is trying to help us understand a lost generation. Or help us understand why so many American men come home from these wars and kill themselves. It does not seem to care at all about these deeper issues. After trying to read his book, and trying to watch this film, I see nothing to commend this man and his wasted life. If somewhere in the acting and in the script and in the direction, somebody was crying for help that never arrived...well, maybe that is a point worth rescuing. But I suspect no one really cares because he was such a precise and talented killer.",3,25,64,9 January 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," The declining attention span of the US Audience
","Really? First of all, the whole Nazi alternative history theme should be retired. Second, I love Marvel comics, read them as a boy, many of them. I liked them. So I understand the initial urge to accept yet another movie bringing up the Marvel super heroes. Ever since Stan Lee decided to retire and count his money, the franchise has declined into mere commercialism. Sometimes the same old tricks, and the tired chase scenes and the over-worked dangling from peril scenes can only be stretched so far...in this film it is to far. After watching the film I could not tell you what is was about, it is completely forgettable. I cannot recall a single interesting moment beyond my surprise to see that Tommy Lee Jones is in the film. I had no idea he was. Really, I am astonished at the overall high rating of this piece of trash. Is the attention span of the movie-going public so in decline? That such a poor film could be so well rated is mysterious to me and would make a more interesting subject for a movie than this film was.",Null,76,162,28 July 2011
Silence," Propaganda: Divorced From Context (Truth)
","This is a beautiful but deeply flawed film. Missionaries did not travel to Japan in this historical period 'to do good'. They went as paid agents of the church, of the Spanish crown, of the English and Dutch trading companies. In this fil we have two 'do good' priests arriving in Japan at a moment when the Christians are outlawed in Japan. We are never ever given much explanation at all as to why the Christians were outlawed. No mention of the lies, the theft, the back room deals, the corruption and plans for conquest of Japan being hatched by the Church and its trading partners. In essence, this film is a fantasy and a collection of falsehood, where the actual truth is suspended fro dramatic effect by an ageing director who should know better and who once had the courage to do better. I find the film so deficient in historical fact, in cause and effect, as to be laughable. It is in fact sad to see such a beautifully acted, photographed and directed film fall into such a terrible pit of propaganda, historical distortion and outright misrepresentation of the church, the Japanese and the truth itself. The cruelties depicted are hard to watch and every one of them is presented without context. There is in fact something cowardly about this film. In the end it does not serve history, the Japanese, the Church or the casual film viewer. It is a cruel- hearted film presented entirely without context.",3,10,17,25 January 2017
Selma," Something is Missing, Flat
","Something, hard to define, is missing in this important film. This film takes the viewer on a journey to Selma Alabama at the crucial time of the Civil Rights movement that took place during the life of Martin Luther King. It covers the important facts, describing clearly the sad situation that people of color faced in trying to register to vote in the segregated south. Even today, the efforts by white-dominated election boards make it more and more difficult for people of color to register and make their votes in the old south. The actor playing Dr. King, in my view, is one of the serious problems this film has. He seems to do a good job, but something serious is missing. The fact that he is not an American is part of this problem. There is something artificial about his acting. It is technically sound, yet lacks some deeper presentation of the driven, inspiring personality that defined Dr. King. Perhaps the problem is in the context. We don't really see any sense of the history that lead to this confrontation. The beat down on the bridge is, in my view, poorly filmed and does very little to capture the full outrage, violence and terror of that event. Certainly this is a difficult scene to set up and record, but Hollywood is very well-equipped to do things like this. A lot has been made of the so-called snubbing of Oprah in this film. She has a small part in the beginning of the film, a scene that could have been played by anyone. The scene where she tries to register to vote, while being questioned and intimidated by a series of crazy questions from the voter registrar is very helpful in telling us what this film is about. There is nothing exceptional about her small part, so I see no cause at all for her to imagine that for such a small part she should be nominated for an Academy Award. The very idea seems really childish. A lot of facts were left out, or glossed over; so an enormous opportunity seems to have been lost. Selma is a good film about the civil rights movement, but not a great film. It is flat, the lead actors are not very interesting and the script, in particular, seems half- finished. It comes across as a rough draft of an idea for a film rather than a finished product. I was very disappointed in this film. In particular I did not like the actors playing Doctor King or President Johnson. The photography, the camera work, as well was not very good...flat and dry. Perhaps we all have inflated expectations. This is such an important and dramatic story; yet it was created and presented in a very un-inspired form with to many missing parts. The part I absolutely did not like at all in any way is the 'song' that closes the film. The semi-rap composition was very disrespectful and tried much to hard to be 'relevant'. And the fact that it is one of the few points on which it was nominated by the Academy, as 'best song' is just sad.",4,58,111,19 January 2015
Super 8," Empty cloverfield clone with less interesting ending
","Cloverfield Clone with a higher budget and a far less, strangely complicated story line with no ending at all, which is not a spoiler. Spielberg makes the most predictable films and with market cynicism targets this movie to young kids, mostly male. I found this movie to be such an empty clone that one wonders if JJ Abram is not really just a one film guy. I am at the point where when a film has Spielberg's name on it, I know the film will be glossy, fancy and utterly empty. The children in this show is where the story centers, but boy does this film lead to so many unanswered questions. Some important scenes seem to be missing, as there are many unexplained developments here. While mildly entertaining in a shallow way, I cannot understand at all the good reviews this disjointed film has earned to date.",2,7,15,15 June 2011
Jack Reacher," Several fatal Falws in this film
","This film has several fatal flaws: 1: Tom Cruise. I have never been a serious fan of Cruise. He seems OK for fantasy projects like Mission Impossible. Playing the big, hard, mysterious Jack Reacher is an impossible stretch. Absolutely one of the poorest casting choices ever made. He is adequate in this film, I can give him that...but Reacher demands something better. Child's has, I believe, deeply damaged his brand by endorsing, even bragging about, this incredibly poor casting choice. 2. the big chase scene with the cars. Reacher never had any big car chase scenes, but the director and whoever else just had to put one in, and a really pointless one that does nothing at all to advance the story line. This story in particular, was really great because it had so little car action in it. 3. Failing to follow the story. Reacher is such a compelling and unique character. The film here is just so generic, it misses so many of the great jewels of character that make Reacher such an interesting character. The film is presented in a dumbed down action style of film, when the original story is a smoldering mystery with really brilliant clues, conclusions and mystery solving. The director here failed miserably in that aspect of the nature of Jack Reacher. It is of course always a bitter experience when hacked together Hollywood producers attempt to make films of great books, but this one is specially bad, obtuse, dumbed down, not even close. The director could not even come close to Reacher's famous coffee habit, that part of the character being portrayed by Cruise with exceptional lameness. I can't make a good review of the plot and the cast, it was just such a hacked together film that it does no justice to Lee Child's great original story. Rather than watch this film I would advise the viewers to buy the book...there are even versions for readers. For iPhone and kindle users. As for the film, you will thank me later if you avoid seeing it.",2,3,11,27 March 2013
Inception," Dead World Dead Dreams
","As an American Indian i was raised, unlike modern people, with a deep ceremonial experience with dreaming. Every idea in modern society seems to diminish the natural ability of people to dream and to remember what they dream. A film like this exploits the natural interest people have in dreams to tell an impossible story. As entertainment it is passable, even interesting...as information on dreaming it is not only worthless, it takes the mind away from any hope of effective dreaming. This is the toxic nature of the film-making experience, where we see reality in such a skewed and unreliable way that we no longer understand reality. Human society has surrendered its powers to dream to the church, to the university, to the corporate paymaster and so modern life is for most people dreamless. Given an opportunity to bring some great idea about dreaming to the screen, the filmmakers instead make a fantasy that is complicated, over-acted and so unrealistic I am just amazed that so many dreamless people have given it such a high rating. Dreaming takes place inside the human spirit, real dreaming takes place among groups of people. But people no longer know this. Dreaming evolved in the human mind from the many thousands of generations people spent living and sleeping together...which they no longer do. As an experienced dreamer I think this film is useless. As one who likes a good film, I think it is useless. Modern people just don't get it, and this sadness is the major component in the new world order.",1,21,39,31 October 2010
Munich," The Speilberg has no clothes
","A take on the Emperor has no clothes. This is a sad, propaganda, contrite and over wrought film. The problem: Spielberg. Maybe I am the only one, but I find Spielberg to be just terrible at films. His ego is out of control. His actual sensitivity to real and actual people is none. This is such an important story, and by all means it should have been made. Perhaps it is time to remake it, with a different group. We are supposed to believe that regular people from off the street organized, stalked and killed the terrorists who planned the killings and kidnappings of Israeli athletes in Munich. There is an underlying falseness to this work, as there is to almost everything Spielberg touches. Spielberg is famous for making stories like this that set us all up for the accusation that we must be anti-jewish if we do not like his work. That is such nonsense. Spielberg, simply, is just a terrible teller of stories. He is a poser with money, and somehow, because of his 'influence' he makes works of absolute mediocrity that get awards, that get parised but are almost all absolutely forgettable. This track them down and blow them up movie is tired, boring and not really believable. Like many people, I thought the events depicted in this film were horrific and yes, Israel should have done all it could do to bring the perps to justice. But a self-serving, over wrought film like this is not justice for anyone. It is sadly a product by the most over-rated film maker of my lifetime. Yes, you should probably watch this film for its historic significance but not for any truth it could have told, because it does not tell any truths, it only tells us about Spielberg and his massive ego.",3,2,2,14 April 2020
Cloud Atlas," No. No. No.
","Elaborate trash. Stylish arrogance. A film for people who have attention deficit disorder, at best. The nonsense of this film begins with a strangely cast Tom hanks mumbling in an incomprehensible accent about who can figure out what? While all of the many pointless events of this film are supposed to be connected, the only connection I can see in this film is how otherwise gifted actors, directors and producers can be tricked into working on this incomprehensible film. There used to be an art in complex films called 'continuity'...and that is the first sacrifice of this film. It jumps from past to future to present, between actors and accents, between scenes and dialogue with such confusion that really the effort can only be described as absurd. Are people afraid to tell the truth now? That this film has such a high rating is very suspicious. Are the ratings made by the actors and their friends? Are the ratings here honest? I do not see how they could be, as this is a confusing, disjointed and really pathetic attempt at something that in itself makes no sense. There is not one character accompanied by a history or a sense of why we should care about them, where they come from or what they are doing. I can only imagine that people have allowed themselves to rate this film so highly rather than admit they were tricked out of their money into enduring what can only be described as torture. Hanks in particular is just horrible in this film.",1,13,29,22 December 2012
