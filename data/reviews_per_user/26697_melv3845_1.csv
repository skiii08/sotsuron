United 93," Well done. A justice to the victims and their families.
","Greengrass spent much time with the families of the victims of Flight 93. They wanted this story to be available to the public and expressed their approval of the film. It is a fitting memorial to those who had to die that others might live. I loved that it was completely devoid of politics--no snide asides. It merely showed the horror of that day in the history of our beloved country. Because there were no Hollywood stars, I was not distracted from the story. That was the reason for the film: to simply and in real time tell the painful story. I felt I was on that plane, deciding what I would do when I realized it was headed for a target. Whether or not I acted would not change my fate. The film showed how quickly many things I value become trivia. It showed that life is so precious and I must spend it well with those I care about.",10,5,10,1 May 2006
