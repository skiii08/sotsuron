The New World," Being high on peyote must give a similar feeling
","I made the incredible mistake of thinking this movie would be like '' Tristan & Isolde. That it'd be the kind of epic war tale that Hollywoodstudios tend to make once in a while; action-packed romance while being light-hearted and funny at the same time. It wasn't...Completely ignorant of the complexity of this movie I watched it with a group of friends. None of them highly educated on ''the better movie'', probably not knowing that Fellini isn't an Italian sports car, thinking that a good movie has to be full of action, tits and gore and that drama is for women or gay people. So, to summarize my thoughts, the usual mainstream crowd. They thought that this movie sucked, and I can't blame them. So to be honest, maybe my judgment is colored by their negative response during the movie.I myself am very fond of the first ten minutes of '' Once upon a time in the west ''. Building up the tension by just showing some strong visual imagery, like the turning wheel of the windmill, a fly bothering a man and people waiting for things to come. '' The new world '' is like this; rather than having dialog or action in it, it tries to tell a story by showing images of nature and people staring to each other. But unlike '' Once upon...'' this isn't just a phase of the movie, this is everything, this is THE movie. It makes this picture very inaccessible and boring. It also doesn't help that the few lines of dialog in it are just some random thoughts about love, like: Pocahontas: He is like a tree. He shelters me. I lie in his shade, or, Pocahontas: Mother, why can I not feel as I should... must? Once false, I must not be again. Take out the thorn.It's like all the main characters are high on peyote and in their highness try to say something worthy about life and love. It felt like complete randomness to me.Okay, so far all of the bad things about this movie, I must also say that at times I felt like it was film-making in its purest form. I really adored the scenes in which John Smith learned English to Pocahontas, or, when Pocahontas is seeing the cold and dirty England for the first time in her life. These sporadic moments levitate the movie to a higher level, but they don't make up for the boring feeling the movie as a whole gives.",6,0,1,10 June 2007
Marie Antoinette," Sex and the city....renaissance style!
","Marie Antoinette was doomed to go into history as a shallow little goat, that had to pay the price for being dumb and ignorant. This movie gives us another perspective. We see a self-aware girl - being restricted by inhumane expectations from her family - that is using her own sexuality to give way to some personal freedoms. By making her into the post-sex and the city heroine from our time, Coppola made this historical figure into a lively and identifiable woman. One that most women can relate to. At the end we see how she is matured enough to make a choice that'd cost her her life, but made her into a respectable person, and certainly not into the goat we all read in our history books she was.This movie looks visually stunning with the beautiful images of Versailles. Kirsten Dunst is a terrific Marie Antoinette, as the natural looking but still very beautiful actress she is. I adored the scenes in which we see how a naked Dunst is surrounded by gossiping maids, showing how vulnerable this woman was to her environment.",9,0,2,24 December 2007
Deja Vu," One big Deja Vu itself
","If I'm completely honest I'd say that this movie itself is one big Deja Vu. We don't see anything that hasn't been done before. Denzel Washington plays another charismatic FBI-agent with the task of saving a girl. He did it before, and he most likely will do it again. But since that is the thing he's damned good at, you won't hear me complain about it.The storyline of altering time and the consequences appears deeper on the outside than it actually is. In the end it are the nice explosions and action-pumped car chase that steal the show rather than any philosophical side to the subject. All the SF talk is just a way of making it more believable.I may appear a bit sarcastic, but I'm not. This movie really doesn't do anything wrong by being a well-crafted thriller. You never have the feeling that they elevate any of the subjects to a higher plain nor do you care. Pure fun is good once in a while. And it's never a punishment to watch Denzel Washington act.",8,0,1,27 March 2008
Mississippi Burning," Dafoe and Hackman are an excellent duo
","This movie deals with the question if it is okay to use non-ethical methods of working by cops to fight outrageous injustice. Its setting is an American village in which the black population is systematically being abused by white supremacists. A young FBI-agent from New York ( Willem Dafoe ) and his cynical partner ( Gene Hackman ) discover that the racism is broad amongst the population and that even authority figures are involved in it. Every time they find a way to deal with the problem, they stumble upon fear, and therefore unwillingness to cooperate , from the blacks. At a certain point the agents find themselves using pure intimidation and violence to fight back against the injustice.I like it how the relationship between Dafoe and Hackman is slowly evolving throughout the story. At first there is some unwillingness to work together, but slowly they start to accept each other and their different methods of working. ''Good cop'' Dafoe is the honest one never straying from the law; Hackman is the bad cop who will use intimidation to get to the core of things. Both characters aren't necessarily heroes. They are flawed, emotional beings that stand seemingly powerless against something that is so much bigger than they realize at first. At a certain point both their methods of working mingle together in the sake of solving things.It's also nice that Hackman's character becomes involved with the case when he's experiencing the brutality of the situation; from a clearly apathetic person he turns into someone who is bend on fighting the injustice.I find this one of the best movies made about the recent '' Apartheid '' in American history. It is realistic, gritty and has no false sentimentality in it. It tells a brutal tale without creating heroes and villains.",9,0,1,8 December 2007
Silent Hill," If only this was the new standard for video game-based cinema...
","Most movies based on games just suck. In a lot of cases they suck even harder than imaginable ( Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Alone in the dark, etc).We already had some pretty decent movies based on Tombraider and Resident Evil ( forget the sequels...) And now they turned Silent Hill into a pretty steady psychological horror-flick that stays true to its virtual counterparts. The movie itself is a treat for the fan of the franchise - you'll recognize some sets and creatures from the games - and does have a solid storyline and visually stunning imagery. Some of the acting of the side-characters is a bit dull, but the main character Rose DaSilva ( Radha Mitchell ) and her wicked daughter ( Deborah Kara Unger ) do have enough charisma to keep you emotionally involved with the story. One thing: it all felt a bit artificial and over-the-top. They could've tuned down on the monsters and action sequences. They make the movie feel like a train ride in a ghost house instead of an atmospheric mystery story.",7,0,1,29 August 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Not as good as they want you to think, not as bad as the critics say it is
","The movie is in itself not as strong or groundbreaking as the Oscar-nominations and the attention by the press made you believe. The theme of a dysfunctional family going on a road trip to discover each other and themselves, is something that we have seen before in the past. So, it's not like they are threading on uncharted territory with this title. The young girl in the main role - mostly the subject of all the praise - is as cute as she is thoroughly annoying. I enjoyed the characters around her more than I did enjoy her presence. She's not a brilliant actress, but just a kid that plays her role with verve.It's easy to degrade this heartwarming comedy by comparing it to the legendary status it unrighteously generated. ''They said it was brilliant, but it isn't! So, it's nothing! '' That kind of reasoning seems to be in the mouth of those who didn't like it. But I think it's unfair to the title. While it is not a perfect movie, it still is an amusing comedy with a indie-feel to it that exceeds most of the crap that is supposed to be funny. It has a nice philosophy on how we should accept that life just isn't that form-able as we'd like it to be, and that we should enjoy the things that do come on our path. It's optimistic by being a bit depressing. A refreshing take on all the happy ends that we usually get from American filmmakers.",8,0,1,29 February 2008
Saw III," A ''television show'' made for the big screen...!
","I actually think this third installment is a huge improvement on the second part. In the second part the contraptions were less gruesome and the horror felt more mainstream. Finally they go back to the core of the concept by focusing on the sick and twisted mind games of the Jigsaw. The characters are judging themselves by becoming a part of the serial killers' master-plan.The movies start to feel like a television show as Prison Break; every ''episode'' gives more insight in the characters and their motives. So, keep them coming. I won't be seeing them on the big screen, but there's a video rental store around the corner.",8,0,0,18 March 2008
National Treasure," Better than expected
","I wanted to hate this movie on forehand, but when I evidently stumbled upon it, I watched it and now I must confess that it was better than expected. It's boyish adventure movie, feeling influenced by both Indiana Jones and The Da Vinci Code. It's action-packed, filled with good jokes and the sets are absolutely stunning. It does feel a bit too political correct at times, how different than the grumpy bastard that my all-time hero Indiana Jones was. Overall, I must say that this is a great flick to watch with your younger brother or son.You'll be mildly entertained while the little one has the time of his life.",7,0,2,21 December 2007
The Holiday," I'm too much male for this flick ;)
","I don't consider myself being a macho male, but chick flicks like The Holiday do drive me to the edge of being very annoyed and agitated. Men just weren't born for sugary romance stories, with a sappy Christmas atmosphere. The characters are annoyingly psycho-analyzing each other and themselves all the time - this movie must be written by a female, no man tells openly about his fear for relationships like Jude Law does at one point- and every character flaw is brought upon us as being cute and adorable. And don't forget the extremely adorable twin sisters, the cuddly dog and the nice old man. But I must be fair, I did enjoy this movie to some degree. It's always a treat to see beautiful actors as Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law interact with each other. Jack Black kinda ticked me off. The guy is hilarious, but in this movie he just didn't fit in. Overall, it is a decent RomCom, one that deserves its place amongst Love Actually and Pretty Woman. I'd favor a more darker approach to the subject of love, but I can also understand why a lot of people like this. Everyone has the right to their taste, don't they? :)",7,0,1,21 December 2007
30 Days of Night," Good vampire flick
","This movie reminded me of the recent remake of ''Dawn of the Dead''. Undead creatures are haunting a group of civilians, and they have to fight back with all means accessible. There is one big difference and that is that this flick is set into a small Alaskan town in which it won't be light within 30 days. And as we all know: undead thrive in the darkness. I liked the dark atmosphere and the black humor combined with a thrilling tale of saving yourself against the ultimate evil. I also adored how they gave the vampires a religious way of thinking. It's as if their leader is some cult-figure and the others follow them as mindless goats. Nice metaphor of how some religious people are brought into doing hideous things out of their beliefs. The only thing is that there are a few clichés too many and the storyline feels a tad bit inadequate at times. It didn't spoil the experience enough to bitch about it, but it's worth to mention it to those who didn't see the flick yet.",8,2,4,24 December 2007
The Terminal," Silly movie, despite its good intentions
","Despite that this movie has a heartwarming undertone, my cynical side just can't cope with this ultra-sweet film that tries to deliver a true message on a wrong way.The protagonist, a refugee being stuck on an airport due to inhumane bureaucracy, is a totally clichéd version of a real immigrant. He doesn't have anything in common with anyone really wanting to build up a life in the United States. And that's my biggest problem with this movie, the total lack of any realism in the main character played by Tom Hanks. At the end we see his true reason to go to the U.S.A. and believe me if I say that it's an anti-climax of epic proportions to see the silly reason of why this guy has to endure all this pain to set foot on American soil. Add up the completely senseless love-story around Catharina Zeta-Jones, as always being too artificial with her stunning beauty but failure to act natural, and you get a very silly movie.But like I said in my introduction, it has an important message to give to its audience. I also believe that immigrants build up America, and the rest of the western world for that matter, and that they should be cherished for their efforts instead of despised as happens too often. In Holland we recently had a political wave that tried to tune down Immigracy. It created a lot of sad stories of people that build up a living in our country but had to leave due to inhumane bureaucrats. This being said, I must add that positive stories about immigrants are important to tell. Spielberg had a good point by making this movie, but he should have made it more conform the truth...",6,0,2,28 June 2007
1408," Wicked delight
","My friends stared at me dumbstruck when I told them that I consider 1408 as a black comedy rather than a horror flick. '' Dude, did we just watch the same movie? '' one of them exclaimed with an ironic look on his face.It starts of with the introduction of Mike Enslin ( John Cusack ), a traumatized writer that lost all faith in God and the supernatural after the death of his child. He spends his days trying to uncover paranormal occurrences as a lie by writing guides on the paranormal. A twisted leap of faith brings him in contact with the ''haunted'' room 1408, that is said to have a way to make its inhabitants kill itself in less than an hour. Manager Olin ( a short, not quite memorable role by Samuel L. Jackson ) does everything in his power to stop Enslin from going to this room. But,as you might have guessed, he fails and Enslin does go. From that point on the story unfolds as a roller-coaster of nightmarish situations for our cynical protagonist.The thing with 1408 is that it's not that scary. Or,to be precise, its premise is scary but the outcome certainly isn't. But that doesn't make it an unpleasant movie. On the contrary. I really enjoyed the sadistic battle between Enslin and the horrible nightmares that ''room 1408 '' forces upon him. The room has the fiendishly power to be one step ahead of Enslin. Every attempt to escape culminates into more awkward situations. Not frightening, but cynical on a funny way. To give an example: at a certain point Enslin finds out that there is someone on the opposite of the hotel. He waves, trying to get attention, and discovers that this person is actually mimicking his every move. It is himself that he's seeing, and not some person that can come to his rescue. And than suddenly this mirrored version of himself is attacked by a screaming weirdo with a knife. He turns around, and...yeah, he's also being attacked. And this is just one example of the many tortures that will occur during the rest of the film.",8,0,0,11 September 2007
Bruce Almighty," Funny comedy, despite its religious undertone
","I'm not really a religious person and I certainly don't like it if Western film makers put a clearly visible Christian message in their movies. This being said, I must say that I wasn't annoyed by ''Bruce Almighty''. Though its intent is clearly to make people feel more positive about Christianity and their God, it does have enough funny jokes in it and a decent enough storyline for a broad public. Even an atheistic person as myself can enjoy this charming movie. Jim Carrey gives a perfect performance as the loser that's blaming God for his misfortune, not using his plastic face that often to generate some cheap laughs. Jennifer Aniston is, well...Jennifer Aniston. I loved Morgan Freeman's God as the wise father figure with a cruel sense of humor.",7,0,0,8 July 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Decent ending to the franchise!
","This episode of the Die Hard-series is a decent ending. At least, I hope that this is the last one. In Hollywood you're never sure if they really can leave a successful franchise alone, just to preserve its legendary status.In this part John McClane has to take on a group of terrorists that hack the system and screw up the entire infrastructure of the U.S.A. I personally like this approach. It makes the story of McClane a bit more epic than in previous parts of the series. It also has a nice touch of actuality in it, having in mind the terrorist-threat after 9-11 and the failing of help after hurricane Katrina. We see a nightmarish America in chaos; cars crashing, a complete blackout of water and electricity, stock markets collapsing,people panicking, terrorists using vile methods to manipulate the media and police, firefighters and medical help failing to response quick enough. They really did their best to visualize an America during a complete Armageddon.There are no Arabs to be seen in the entire plot, and I think that is a good thing. Having all-American hero McClane fight terrorists would give the franchise a nasty, propaganda-like atmosphere. They wisely chose for a political correct villain. Though I must say that his psychological reasons to do this vile act are a bit lame. He's a bit of an anti-villain, so to speak. I'd rather see a more evil character to try and stop McClane on his rampage to save the day. Timothy Olyphant has the great bewildered look in his eyes to make him one scary dude, but with his mediocre script he doesn't really come to life as should be. His motives are too vague. At the end, this part is thoroughly enjoyable. It isn't as good as it once was, mainly because the studio decided that it had to have a pg-13 rating. Most of the action is grander than before, existing out of exploding things and other less physical brutalities. The plot is paper-thin, but hey, I think that action-wise this movie sets a new standard for action movies in the future. Nowadays McClane isn't the only angry action hero, but he does have the right to exist next to more recent heroes as Jack Sparrow or Jack Bauer.",8,2,5,9 July 2007
The Simpsons Movie," As expected...and that's a good thing!
","I expected an episode with a lenghtier storyline and graphical improvements on the animation. Nothing more, and most certainly nothing less. And that's exactly what I got. You can bitch about that and say: why pay for a ticket for something that you can see on TV ( as Homer quite rightly says to the audience at the beginning of the movie ). You know what, screw you! Your life won't drastically change after watching this movie, let that be clear at the beginning. If you're a fan, you'll like it; if you don't know the franchise, be ashamed; if you hate the show, don't go. That's all I have to say.",8,0,1,30 August 2007
