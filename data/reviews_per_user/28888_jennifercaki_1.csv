Hereditary," Best horror movie I've seen in a very long time.
",The foreshadowing in this movie makes it a really fun watch. I'm guessing people who do not like to read 'in between the lines' would not like this movie. Also those who read too much into it and see it as absurd would also really not like this movie. But it's a movie so those people need to chill out. Definitely give it a watch and decide for yourself.,10,0,1,10 May 2020
