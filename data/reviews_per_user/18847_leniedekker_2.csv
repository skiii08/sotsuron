Blade Runner 2049," Bad to the bone
","A disapointment to me after so long time waiting.
Story was dull, And many lines unnesesary in it.
The main player dull and emoitionless.
The effects were nice , but nothing special ,Did like the new spinner.
The envoirment to dull and haze to be real, And completely difrent then the original.
Ford played nice sadley to short, Better they made a movie of him in a seqeul,
as main player whit Rachel.
Why they dident folow the line of the first movie, Its so sad they
made this so completly ofset to the orginal.
3 stars becoz mostley it was so borring to watch.",3,4,6,30 January 2018
A Quiet Place," super exciting !
","Super exciting, great movie for people who love SF horror just like me,
found it comparable with the first Alien film, with a top hunter like the Alien but
then several that go to the smallest sound, Really a film where you almost sit down on the tip of your chair.
Images are shot beautifully without SGI a super movie, Sound effects
And the lack of sound in the tense moments makes it creepy to see
especially at those moments.
The Aliens look realy creepy and are like insects in their hunting patterns.
also for the most part played in the dark of night what gives it a extra creepy
atmosphere to it.
I hope there comes a sequel or a preqeul of how they came.",10,4,8,23 May 2018
