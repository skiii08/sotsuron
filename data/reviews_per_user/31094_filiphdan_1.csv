The Lobster," Pseudo intellectual attempt ended in a bad movie....
","OK so this is my first review here and i have come to IMDb for more than 8 years now, so why is this my first time writing? Well the movie itself is slow and awkward, witch sometimes is good, i like awkward , but not on this one, the comedy parts was the only reason i still gave it a 4 witch it truly does not deserve... I understand the message that the director attempted to transmit here, but he really tried to hard to make it over the top, it was not necessary, the story was good and it had everything to be a great independent movie including a god cast of actors. I also wonder what the hell was thinking the guy who wrote the music, and why did the director thought it was a match for the movie... Just to finish don't waste your time on this one,i can recommend something like Lars and the real Girl witch is the first that comes to mind among many although it is not a dark comedy it is at least well executed and if you want something more dark go with gone girl for example.",4,7,14,8 January 2016
