Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," wonderful......
","This film is not even close to a disappointment. It is filled with anything and everything a Star Wars film should have. The best element of the film is how it shows Jedi's in this time. There is a way of life to being a Jedi, and there was a time when they were respected, trusted, and believed in.The best scene is certainly the final lightsaber Duel of the Fates. I tried hard not to blink so that I wouldn't miss one frame of the fastest sword fight I've ever seen. Can't believe I have to wait three years for the next one. At least it's not 16.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The best Star Wars film ever
","Excellent filmmaking. The only thing that makes Empire better than Clones, is the acting; otherwise Clones is superior. George brought back R2 and Threepio as the primary source of comic relief. All the Jango and Boba stuff was terrific. Anakin's temptations  are terrific. Amidala looks fantastic. ALL of the action scenes are incredible ; chase through Coruscant, Jango vs. Obi-Wan, etc. Mace was great. It's packed full of surprises, and connections with episodes 4, 5 and 6. I'm not giving away the ending; I'll just say 4 letters: Y  O  D  A!!!",10,1,2,16 May 2002
