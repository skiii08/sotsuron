The Blair Witch Project," Overall...Pretty Good
","Ok, so it had a little to much hype, and thats too bad, because this film is really not too bad.  A little unrealistic at times, but thats ok, I mean, compare it with the other movies of our time and it is pretty realistic.  I didn't see this in theaters, but I rented the DVD version last night and watched it.  It certinly provokes a lot of thoughts that I just don't have the time to write.  Its a good film, and I reccomend it.  I'm even going to buy it. Sure, Heather probably wouldn't have been recording if all what she recorded was real life, but it was a movie, and thats how you people that voted it as a 1 should think of it.  I give it an eight...a good and original idea.",9,0,1,23 October 1999
