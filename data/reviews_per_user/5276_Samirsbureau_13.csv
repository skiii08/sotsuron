Don't Ever Waste your money on this movie! go watch another movie ! maybe some twilight fans might like it ! if u like twilight you're gonna rate it as 5/10 and if you're not you're gonna give it a zero!

Deepwater Horizon," A sad true disaster, that could've not been done any better.
","I've never heard about this accident actually, so when I saw a Peter Berg film that shows a sad disaster about oil spill in the middle of the ocean with Mark Whalberg and Kurt Rusell, I said this is going to be a good movie, I need to watch that.And after watching it, I Have to tell you it's PERFECTLY made, from the acting to the action scenes. The first 20 minutes or so of the movie just shows you how safe and peaceful the job is and how happy everyone is, until comes a discussion and there are 2 opinions, a careless one and a thoughtful one, and you know that they will just do something stupid that will result in a huge disaster. and Afterwards, It's just pure explosions you start seeing, and people dying, it becomes a tragedy. But also the good thing about this movie is that it feels soooooo realistic to the point where you actually think this is real life. The only weak point to me of this movie was that it felt a bit rushed in the end.Conclusion: It's a good action/drama about a true story that deserves to be told, at least to honor those who passed away. Don't miss out on this movie , definitely one of the best movies in 2016.",8,1,3,27 December 2016
Passengers," A highly enjoyable ride that unfortunately got rolled over by the Critics.
","After the trailer release of this movie it became one of this year's most anticipated movies, but some people were expecting something entirely different than what this movie aimed for, and the result was their disappointment. People need to be aware that this movie is an ADVENTURE/ROMANCE and a bit SCI-FI. NOT A SCI-FI 2001:SPACE ODYSSEY KIND OF MOVIE.I will start giving my own honest review of this movie. First of all, The acting in this movie is phenomenal, of course when you get 2 great actors like Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence you know it would work in any kind of role, and it's true, the chemistry between both of them just works flawlessly and it's very gorgeous as they're both very handsome and it's just nice to see them on screen.Then comes the VISUALS, which i consider to be this year's best ( Along with Dr.Strange ), The best way to watch this movie is at a theater with a huge screen and definitely better to catch the 3D version. I really don't know where to start with the visuals because the whole movie is just beautifully shot and the CINEMATOGRAPHY of this film is perfectly done, probably each scene in this movie is Iconic. The Plot wasn't as good as the other factors but still it managed to keep the pacing of the movie going and I was definitely not bored, even though the ending wasn't spectacular but again this isn't Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, this is just a movie about 2 lovers surviving on a spaceship alone.The best way to describe this film is to say that it's Titanic all over again but in space and it's beautifully shot, emotional, and overall an exciting experience.It's really sad that people misunderstood the point of this film and were going for a complex space/time plot instead of a simple good-looking love story, but I know that moviegoers will definitely like this film. Give it a try and if not for the story then just for Wonderful scenes and for the link between the 2 main charactersConclusion: Great, Simple, Gorgeous and Highly Entertaining are the four things you'll be saying after watching this movie.",7,461,677,22 December 2016
Ted," Funny And Unique !!!
","After reading the reviews about the movie and what people say about it , that it's boring and awful i thought that the movie was gonna be stupid , but my friends told me that it's hilarious so i just went to the cinema and booked a ticket ! Really , i wasn't disappointed at all ! i almost laughed the whole time , the look of Ted himself while he's moving is very funny !! i can't stop laughing when i see him fighting or drinking alcohol !! and i learned a lesson , is to never trust people's reviews ! And it's not a children movie !! don't let your kids watch this movie because Ted himself is very impolite the whole movie !! Don't skip this movie it's a great one ! i really enjoyed it !",8,2,6,4 September 2012
Underworld Awakening," Selene at her best!
","I went today to the movie with my friend , i wasn't very excited,but i wasn't disappointed at all! and it was in 3D! the director did a great job on the 3D! there were a lot of scenes that have wonderful effect! for example: Selene throws grenade at ya , Werewolves jumping on you , fire , breaking glasses , the 3D was perfect anyway! it added a lot of depth to the movie too! I actually jumped in a lot of scenes. It worth the extra money! it's just 4 dollars or 5 in some areas! it added a lot of effect to the movie! As they say, the movie meant to be 3D!Now,let's talk about the action in the movie, Selene and the others were perfect! Selene had special moves which popped your eyes. if you're an underworld fan you're gonna rate it as 10/10 and if you're not you're gonna rate it as 9/10 ! And Finally, The Plot , it was good but not as much as the action and the 3D! if u liked the trailer , you're absolutely gonna like the movie more than it! Now, Go grab some friends and popcorn and watch it, I bet you're gonna enjoy it!",7,7,15,28 January 2012
Drive," When you perfectly mix Art with Action
","Nicholas Winding Refn is knowing for his hidden messages and his artistic style/vision in movies. And certainly it's well known that his movies aren't for everyone, but let me tell you 'Drive' is one of those that people experience in totally different ways. So i'm just going to write my own opinion and my thoughts about the movie.Let's say the movie is split into 2 equal acts:The first one is the buildup, we're introduced to the main characters of the film including Ryan Gosling (A skilled stuntman who falls for his neighbor) and Carey Mulligan (A mother whose husband is imprisoned and she lives with her only son). Nothing big happens in that act except building up the characters and the events that will lead to the second act.The second act is one of the most brutal, violent, gory and suspenseful you can see in any action film. It's filled with jaw- dropping shocking scenes, and it carries on that way till the last second of the film.The ending of the film is open to the viewers interpretation, but that's the way Refn decides to make all of his movies.Everything else in this film is great, from Phenomenal acting to beautiful scenery, also the soundtrack of this film is to be remembered.The movie definitely left me thinking about it when it ended but that's just my opinion, so check it out and see for yourself, I'd definitely recommend it.",8,1,3,17 March 2017
La La Land," A Magical Masterpiece that shows how cruel reality can be!
","LA LA LAND! A Movie that broke the record and won 7 golden globes! What makes this movie so special and worthy to all of these awards?The Music: La La Land is a musical, and despite I'm not really a fan of musicals and just by watching the first scene of the movie I thought the movie wasn't my taste, but by the end of the film I couldn't stop humming the theme of this movie, It sticks to your head in a beautiful way. The music in this film is really perfect and the lyrics are very deep, I'd say it's the kind of music that no one can say no to. You'll be tapping your foot and clapping your hands with this beautiful soundtrack.The Plot: Simple enough, yet very complex and thoughtful. The main idea of this film is 'Dreams Vs Love', and if you have a dream, are you willing to sacrifice? will you give up? I found it very inspirational and almost everyone can relate to it.The Acting: Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are just charming, they're the perfect couple in front of the screen, the chemistry between them is wonderful and their romance is very realistic. Whether acting or dancing, they're just gorgeous to look at.The Cinematography: Very well shot, the colors really shine in the scenes full of joy, and a bit dark when it's sad, it just matches the film's mood. And the angles of shooting are very precise, the way they shot this film makes it very appealing to watch.The Ending: My favorite part of the film, and without spoiling it I can tell you this movie will show you how reality works, and how life can hit you where you least expected, but in the end everything goes on.All in all, La la land really impressed me and is definitely an instant classic, It has everything a perfect movie needs. Go watch this movie immediately if you haven't.",10,6,12,14 January 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Top-Notch Entertainment !
","*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*As a huge fan of the first film, I went to watch the movie as soon as it came out. And I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all.Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Offers so much thrills and an awesome cinematic experience, The action starts right from the opening scene and it doesn't end until the last 2 seconds of the film. The people behind the movie just knew how to not make the audience bored, and they succeeded at that.I have to say that 3D ticket here is worth the additional price, because honestly, if any movie deserved to be really watched in 3D it's this one,It adds so much depth to the scenes and makes the movie alive.The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never really drags even with the movie's long duration.The soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.Due to the movie's high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd were very pleased.In the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else. It's simply one of these movies that are always fun to watch.",8,220,407,4 May 2017
Pitch Perfect 2," The Pitches Are Back With A Worthy Sequel
","Have you seen pitch perfect? who didn't? it's one of the most popular comedy movies in 2012. Did you like it? Well if you didn't, I advise you not to carry on reading this review because you probably won't also like the sequel.Pitch Perfect 2:The Video: Thanks to its experienced director Elizabeth Banks, the video shines brightly. Even though it's a comedy, its really special: the parties, the performances and almost everything in this movie is captured to comfort your eyes and to prevent the audience from falling asleep. Basically, an eye candy.The Soundtrack: The best thing about this movie is the non-stop flawless music. Das Sound Machine really rocked the movie and made it challenging for the Barden Bellas to win. Famous songs and a great track-list, thats all i can say.The Pace: I have recently seen many movies this year that were good but there's always that moment in the movie where you feel bored. Gladly, Pitch Perfect 2 doesn't fall for that mistake and it never slows down, you actually never feel bored in the movie.The Story: The usual story about the Bellas trying to win their competition. Except that this time, it's bigger, a World Wide Championship! And some side stories about each of the characters and what they're going to do after graduating.Overall: As a huge fan of the first part, i found it very original to make a good movie about Acapella which is something new and could be a great advance in the music process of this generation,Pitch Perfect 2 doesn't disappoint at all.Everything we liked about the first part is doubled here.It's like they checked what part of the movie the fans liked and added more of it which means MORE SONGS,MORE FAT AMY,MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT,MORE CHALLENGES and Definitely MORE LAUGHS! After reading the review and watching the trailer you probably know what you're getting from this movie. Feeling into it? Then go watch it because you're surely going to like itFinal Score: 8/10",7,21,38,14 May 2015
Arrival," By far the BEST 2016 SCI-FI FILM
","I watched the trailer of this film and i didn't know what to expect except a movie that's similar to Contact (1997), about aliens and contacting them. So i went in with that in mind, and boy i was absolutely wrong.First of all, This movie IS a slow burn so don't just go in expecting an action movie with aliens attacking Earth and our powerful army just send them back to space, YAAAY. NO, that's not it, it's a smart movie about Humans.The movie starts slow, a professional linguist (Amy Adams) is being called for help when the army found a mysterious object flying in the air, so she tries to contact them and from there the plot starts to get going.The movie raises many questions: Why do we always imagine the extraterrestrial as aggressive beings? Why do we human just terminate anything we don't understand? Why our ego let us control the fate of others? Why can't we understand peace? The Acting, The visuals, the soundtrack, the story are what make this film this year's InterstellarThe pacing is a bit slow, but it's done to grab you into the movie then lets you enjoy it as it unwraps its secrets slowly in the end.It's a twisted film about humanity and fate, go in with an open mind and just sit back and watch closely.. It's a beautiful movie",9,5,14,18 December 2016

Life," An enjoyable reminder of the 'Aliens' franchise
","*SPOILER FREE REVIEW* Judging from the trailer I could tell that this is another sci-fi/horror movie about survival in space, but luckily the trailer didn't spoil much.So I went expecting nothing else, and I have to say I was very pleased by the experience. Let's start by saying that the tension in this movie is really high, as it gets more and more tense as it goes on. The Acting is very satisfying and believable thanks to the great cast, which actually makes you care about the characters and their actions.The Pacing: At first it introduces you to the characters and gives you a small background about them and then the action kicks in and the pace of the movie starts racing till the end of it, it's guaranteed to be thrilled with a movie like this.The Violence: The film is very shocking and violent most of the times, there are no major jump scares but you're on the edge of your seat most of the time.The Scenery: perfectly shot and visioned, it captures the vast terrifying space with all its emptiness and silence, along with some great zero gravity scenes,and the huge spaceship.The movie reminded me a lot of the spectacular 'Aliens' franchise, If you loved it then you'd definitely like this one.Conclusion: Without spoiling anything, I Highly recommend this movie if you're looking for some good thrills, even if you think you've seen plenty of movies like it, it's still so good in its own way and highly entertaining.",7,33,66,23 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," More of a 'Prometheus' sequel than an 'Alien' prequel
","***SPOILER FREE REVIEW***Alien:Covenant is one of the most anticipated movies of the year mainly because its part of the beloved 'Alien' saga and because of its great director Ridley Scott, but does it really deliver?As a fan of Ridley's Sci-Fi work (The 'Alien' Saga, Blade Runner and The Martian), I couldn't wait to see this movie and I was almost sure that it's going to blow everyone away. But apparently, after reading most of the user reviews around here, lots of people didn't like it and called it the worst part in the franchise. But anyway, I just watched the movie and here's what I thought:Alien:Covenant takes place 10 years after the event of Prometheus and I highly recommend that you watch it in order to understand everything going around. Prometheus as a movie, divided its audience... Alien Covenant did the same here, it divided them too. The reason behind that is that the movie suffers from a forced attempt to link Prometheus with the Alien franchise, and that alone made the audience feel confused about what the movie wants to be. The result to this connection made the film looks different than the others 'Alien' films.The problem with the film was that it never felt like an actual alien movie, it focused too much on the unanswered questions that Prometheus left and sometimes totally forgot about the survival-horror factor.However, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie.. After all, I have to say I enjoyed it nonetheless. We get to know more about how the Aliens were created and what happened after Prometheus, I think Ridley wanted to please everyone; the fans of the original Alien and the fans of Prometheus, and what you get here is exactly what happens when you mix both of them, and let's not also forget that Ridley's plan at first was Prometheus 2, later named Alien Covenant.The movie is still worth a watch just for the decent visuals and the great soundtrack and the acting, as for the plot I have to say it's not Ridley's best.DON'T BELIEVE THE 1/10 NOR THE 10/10.In the end I would say that Alien Covenant deserves to be watched at least once specially if you're a die hard fan of the franchise, it's far from being a bad film as everyone's saying, but don't get your expectations too high.",7,27,52,17 May 2017
