The Perks of Being a Wallflower," An amazing piece where arts combine
","I wanted to watch this movie for 2 years now, but having no free time between my hands, I didn't get a chance to watch it until 12/2015. Boy I got to say that this movie brought me the most amount of joy I've experienced in a long time. I've never felt happiness through a movie, especially when someone like Emma Watson - My childhood crush- is in it, and she get kissed by another handsome actor XD; surprisingly enough, I felt extreme joy when they both kissed the first time, and then I almost teared up the second time. Logan's acting in this movie can't be any better, the dude is just fitting in every single aspect to fulfill the role of an emotionally destroyed kid. Emma Watson shines because you can see from her acting that she is into the role.Overall, the movie is an absolute must watch and can't be criticized in any way. It's just not possible that none of us lived one of the character's high school lives, and then we proceeded to think ' is there any one outside that is feeling the same pain as me?'.I love this movie, easily ranked in my top 10.",10,0,2,5 December 2015
