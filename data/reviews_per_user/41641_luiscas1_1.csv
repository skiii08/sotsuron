Angels & Demons," Time-warp
","Great movie, more intense than The Davinci Code. However, anyone acquainted with street traffic in Rome would tell you it is impossible to travel from The Vatican to the Pantheon to the Piazza Del Populo, back to the Vatican to Santa Maria della Vittoria, to Piazza Navona to the Castel San Angelo in the time alloted by the plot. And that was using a car. As to walking/running, the Passetto connecting the castle with the Vatican is half a mile long, and connects to the Apostolic Palace several floors below the Papal Apartments. They had like 5 minutes to cover the distance. Maybe they were borrowing the teleporter from Star Trek and didn't tell us about it.",Null,1,4,16 May 2009
