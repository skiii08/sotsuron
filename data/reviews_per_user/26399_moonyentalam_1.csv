Sucker Punch," Just another exaggerated'Psychological' film
","Might not be baffling but entertaining enough. I felt like watching a live action anime which is my positive take on this movie.Does Baby feel like she's a hero? Probably. However, Bowling's acting is not convincing enough and wasn't able to convey her emotions to the audience effectively. The resting face is no use for this film.",5,1,7,19 May 2020
