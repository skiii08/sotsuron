Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," ***spoilers***This movie is hilarious, and Americans don't understand it***spoilers***
","Yes I couldn't stop laughing. I must be a terrible person then, with very bad taste, laughing at other cultures? I am. I couldn't stop laughing at the Americans, especially after reading the bad reviews on this site. The movies is not an attack at Kazakh culture (or Eastern Europe, Jews whatever you like). We in Europe all know, and understand the irony, that's because we are actually interested in other countries and cultures. And know one or two things about them, like where they are located. So you Americans laugh at the part in which Kazakhstan is made ridiculous by the scene in Borat rides away with the horses in front of the car. Or don't because it's absolutely degrading right? Well guess what, I was born in Eastern Europe, and there are a few people from the village where my grandpa lives who can't ride cars and still move by horses and a wagon. So I thought it to be absolutely hilarious. Things like a village idiot or town drunk, it's all there. And here ends the part in which we're making fun of 'Kazakstan'. Because as soon as Borat get's in the USA, he's making fun of YOU. Because this movie is about a country and it's people: Americans. How can the message be more clear? Why do you not understand it? Apart from some scenes like the nude fighting it makes the USA ridiculous. But the greatest thing about it, is that the American opinions and people are real and the Kazakh language, country and habits are fake. The people in the documentary actually believe that people from Kazakhstan are so incredibly stupid because of the cultural differences. This is proved especially by best scene from the movie, the dinner. And even after the movie: by your reviews. In Europe we know that it's just humor, and don't see it being offensive. Because it's so over the top. Obviously it doesn't seem that way for you reviewers, because why else would you say it makes Kazakstan ridiculous while it's completely implausible?",10,3,9,8 January 2008
