Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Jar Jar
","What I think most people miss about Jar Jar is that one of the big reasons he is there is to show just how noble Qui-Gon and Amidala are. Qui-Gon understands Jar Jar's situation and, given the chance to shuck him off, actually delays his mission to keep him from getting 'pooneeshed' by Boss Nass. Amidala alone pays attention to what Jar Jar has to say and refrains from bagging on him, even when everybody else does, including the droids. In my humble opinion, Jar Jar represents the innocence that both Qui-Gon and Amidala are sworn to protect.",Null,0,1,24 May 1999
