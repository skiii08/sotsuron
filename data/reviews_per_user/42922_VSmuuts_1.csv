Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Never Borat again
","I was forced to watch this crap piece of movie the day before new years eve, and I can tell you that I saw almost nothing that was even remotely funny in it.It is not that I do not like satire from time to time... Or even fake reality humor (like This is Spinal Tap and so on)... But this... Just like the famous cartoons of the Mohammed I failed to see whats so funny about it...It is like being handed a copy of 'Der St√ºrmer' and being expected to laugh at the drawings. This movie says more about its audience than about anything even remotely related to humor.Still, the scenes that featured the bear where quite funny - yet I would not waste two hours of my life to laugh five seconds. Never again, my friends, never again.",2,6,12,2 January 2007
