Catch Me If You Can," fun
","This movie is rather rare nowadays, it had classic style and it was very fun to watch.  It is like a caper from the past translated perfectly for todays audience, slightly reminiscent of Ocean's 11.  DiCaprio and Hanks both give good performances, and Walken does well in the limited showtime he receives. The screenplay was excellent, as well as the script writing.     This is one that will be appreciated later on, if not by people today.",Null,0,1,15 July 2003
