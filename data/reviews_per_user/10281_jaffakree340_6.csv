Alien 3," Worst sequel ever
","How does one follow up one of the greatest action/adventure/suspense movies of all time? Not by producing total crap like this.(Spoiler warning, but consider it charity instead. If you saw and liked 'Aliens', avoid this movie at all costs.)You had an excellent film in Aliens, one which could've ended the whole 'Alien' saga right there and we would've all been happy. But no, some idiot in the studios decides he's going to buy the rights to make a third flick and does an absolutely horrific job with it. First, let's ruin the previous movie by killing everyone. Then, let's send the main character to a varitable planet of Hell and do a Mad Max-ish rehash of the first movie. Oh yea, let's kill her in the end too.Total failure.There are few movies that I actually *hate*. Granted, Lynch's 'Dune' sucked, 'AI' was depressing, but this one is just total, total crap and a half. I hate this movie for what it did to the whole 'Alien' saga.I give it 0 out of 5 stars. In fact, throw it two or three stars into the negative scale.",1,492,526,7 July 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," ARRRRRRRR!!!!!
","It's not often that one leaves the theatre wanting to stay and watch it all over again. PotC is one of those movies.Excellent cast. Johnny Depp makes one of the best, if not the best, pirates ever seen on the screen (I'd throw him in the same boat as Dustin Hoffman's 'Hook'). Capt. Jack Sparrow is one of the most memorable characters in recent years. Orlando Bloom was actually better at Will Turner than Legolas (so far) in LotR. Keira Knightley was surprising. Being a very attractive woman in a pirate film, one would expect her to be either a helpless bimbo in distress or a sultry seductress. Nothing could be further from the truth on both. She was proper, respectable, and played both a damsel and a fighter at the same time. Geoffrey Rush makes for an excellent villain, one you just can't help but like, even though you hate his guts (well, bones in this case). The effects are superb, especially that of the fights in and out of the moonlight (if you don't know what I'm talking about, you'll know when you see it). The music, well, WOW. This is the best soundtrack since Gladiator and possibly even better. Perfect mood setting.All in all, an excellent and fun film that's both enjoyable, full of action and adventure, GREAT music, and can both make fun of itself yet still take itself seriously. On this rare occasion, Cap'n Bruckheimer and his scallywags get an A+.",10,0,1,1 September 2003
Final Destination 2," Horrendous, sadistic, and downright wrong.
","The level of gore, guts, blood, and violence in this film inspires me with yet more hatred of human society. To think that anyone can get off on watching people get slaughtered like that sickens me, and I hope the producers of this movie burn in hell (and I'm not even religious) for the images they put before us. Makes CSI look like Sesame Street. A flat out F, 0 out of 5 stars.",1,3,8,11 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," More fun to watch than Ep.1, but still not deserving of 'Star Wars'
","I'll admit, in a rarity for a SW geek such as myself, I have only seen this film once.The script was a vast improvement, the storyline flowed better, the acting was on par for a SW movie, and the effects were obvioulsy unbelievable as always. But this movie just didn't feel like 'Star Wars'. Something was missing.
Was it the lack of a good lightsaber battle (Yoda not withstanding)? Was it the overuse of mush between Padme-Anakin? Was it how quickly momentum shifted from one side to the other? Or was it once again the lack of Han Solo?I'm not sure. Overall it was a good MOVIE and I would recommend this one for pure entertainment. But it just wasn't Star Wars.3 1/2 out of 5 stars",Null,0,1,3 July 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," I can't see why this film is so highly-regarded.
","To be honest, since I grew up with Sci-Fi flicks like 'Star Wars', 'Aliens', and the various 'Star Trek' series and movies, I'm afraid I can't say how impressive the special effects were for 1968. That said, I also can't see what the freakin' big deal is with this movie!It's extremely slow, the majestic movements through space really don't add anything, the dialogue is extremely bland, and the 'trip'......I guess it's one of those 'You Had To Be There' moments, in this case, 1968.The only real noteworthy part of this should be HAL, which emphasized reliance on computers and what happens when one goes rogue, ironically but blindly foreshadowing such things as the defused Y2K problem. But aside from that, this movie is a big artistic dud for me. The only reason I'd recommend it is to see it's sequel, '2010', which makes a lot more sense, is more entertaining, and answers SOME of the questions left by 2001.",Null,4,8,9 August 2003
Signs," If Hitchcock made an alien movie
","It really bothers me the number of pop-cultured idiots who comment on this movie as a 'let-down' or a 'rip-off'. This movie isn't a UFOs-blowing-up-cities or Aliens-running-rampant-in-our-neighborhoods movie. If you want that, watch Independence Day or the myriad of B-movies following that exact same thing. This movie was pure suspense without the flashiness that ruins so many other movies. It's an excellent and refreshing film that reminds us just what good filmmaking is all about, something we've lost since the days of Hitchcock and since good storytellers have gone politically correct (Spielberg) or cash-motivated (Lucas). Those who can't appreciate such a film need to stick with absurd Bruckheimer flicks or anime to get their flashiness and things blowing up. Those with intelligence and who enjoy good storytelling over mindless eye candy, keep an eye on this Shyamalan fellow....",Null,0,1,22 June 2003
