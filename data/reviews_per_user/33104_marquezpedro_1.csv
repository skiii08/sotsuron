Walk the Line," Walk The Line
","I thought 'Walk the Line' was a great movie with great music. It is very rare in Hollywood when a movie is made with the actual actors sing and playing their own instruments. Unlike other actors who choose not to(won't mention any names, Jamie Foxx). And James Mangold was able to do just that. He was able to do those close-ups while they were singing and made the audience believe they were really watching Johnny and June. And that makes a great movie. Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix did an awesome job. I would like to say one thing on Joaquin's behalf. We (yes there are others who feel the same way) believe Joaquin should have won the Oscar for 'Best Actor' Learning how to sing, play the guitar and act like the 'One and Only Johnny Cash' is not easy and yet Joaquin made it look like he was a pro at entertaining people Well I guess if you look at it in a different way, he is a pro at entertaining people!!!!",Null,0,0,5 June 2006
