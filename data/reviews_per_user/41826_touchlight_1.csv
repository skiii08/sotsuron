Mission: Impossible III," Mission Accomplished
","People expect far too much out of franchises such as 'Mission Impossible:' character development, intense family dilemmas  you name it. But from watching the first two, I am well aware that I'm going to be presented with a shallow, high-octane picture about a pint sized agent who has to save the world (oh, and also rescue a fine young lady). He does so with fine gadgets, a winning smile and a politically correct band of allies. Was I entertained? Yes. Completely. After watching emotionally draining films like 'Vera Drake' in recent years, I begin to wonder whether there is a place for chewing gum cinema. The plot is full of 'unbelievabilities' (i.e. getting into the Vatican on a whim), but it is entertaining. Ethan Hunt returns not as an agent, but as an integral part of the IMF training programme. He is now the teacher, fitting into the mould of the wise old master, the cliché that Liam Neeson has perfected so well. He gave up his whirlwind lifestyle to be with the love of his life, his fiancée Julia. But, like all tough guys, he cannot resist one final mission. Soon enough, intrigue and espionage escalate it into a worldwide affair, with Philip Seymour Hoffman playing the malevolent WMD trader. Predictably, Julia is captured and Mr. Hunt has to recover the paragon of all destruction, the mystical 'Rabbit's Foot.' Turning in a relatively mature performance with a smidgeon of self-mocking, Tom Cruise makes this adventure utterly enjoyable.Though I hate the latex masks and the stupid laptops that make a 'bring' sound every time someone hits 'Enter,' the action sequences are intense  epically intense. And that is the beauty of the cinema  to have jets screaming over your head at a volume that would otherwise infuriate your highly traditional neighbours. Brokeback Mountain, Vera Drake  they're not cinema films. This is. Saving the world in 125 minutes isn't an easy feat, but for Mr. Cruise it's just another day at the office.",7,0,1,7 May 2006
