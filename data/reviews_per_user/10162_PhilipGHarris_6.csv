Blade Runner 2049," Visual Style Covers Poor Plotting
","Let me start out by saying that the look and feel of Blade Runner 2049, from direction, lighting, visual, sound and atmosphere is completely stunning. With shot after lingering shot adding to the style and substance of the movie. Meaning the overall length of the piece can be somewhat forgiven. Yet, sitting in the cinema, it did simply feel a little too long.The real problem I found with this movie were the vast plot holes which ran through the whole story, and these certainly impacted on my enjoyment of the film. As acting was good and characters were well defined.What we have is K - a Blade Runner and replicant who is working on cleaning up the remaining Nexus 8 models and, during investigation coming across a buried crate, containing the remains of a replicant who had become pregnant. A 'miracle' for the other replicants. Blurring the line between replicant and human and establishing a better reason they have rights.Why the replicants have buried the bones in such an obvious place, is never really addressed. Why they did not destroy the bones to make sure they were never discovered, is another problem. However, on finding these K is sent to track down the child and slowly comes to believe this may be him. Due to his memories and taking about 40 minutes of exposition.Whilst this journey is interesting it actually causes a flat spot in the middle of the film where, as a viewer, I wondered what next. As the story struggles to develop on from here. Apart from the impacts of his discovery making him what he hunts - a rogue.For some reason, his police chief then gives him time to go and settle down after this and the dialogue is mixed concerning whether he is being hunted or can return to duty. Her actions only explained by the fact he has been a good officer. The hunted K going back to his apartment to engage in sex with a meld of a replicant prostitute and his house hologram, which feels quite like filler but is meant us to feel more for the hologram, I suppose. As she risks her own 'life' to travel with him later.K finds he isn't the child causing him to hunt down the true child and father, Deckard from the original, and then Deckard is kidnapped by the new controlling company - who clearly want to see if they can isolate how the pregnancy happened. Which pretty clearly makes Deckard a replicant as well - a fact which was left to the viewers' imaginations in the previous film. This is all well and good, I can hear you say, where are the problems. The fact is it's the linking moments that really caused the downfall of the plot for me. The fact K's boss is killed in her office - is there really no surveillance? The fact you'd expect the child to be told to never mention its past, yet it is creating actually moments from its past in other replicants memories - a really clear breadcrumb trail. The fact that K isn't killed on numerous occasions and just 'left-for-dead'. The fact replicants can't breathe underwater - but were built to work in extreme environments. The vaguely described organisations and their intentions and the fact his boss in the police can still track him on her computers - so why haven't all the other Blade Runners found him? Notwithstanding the bees, who obviously eat sand.What this results in is a story that feels half-baked, Jared Leto comes across like a bad Bond villain at the end and some scenes seem unnecessary. While some may think I'm over-thinking this the director gives you time to think about every scene with the lavish interludes. So to best enjoy this movie switch your brain to neutral and turn your senses to the max.",6,7,17,8 October 2017
The Incredible Hulk," Film Makes Hulk Sad
","It concerns me that my friend and I's favourite scene in this movie was the one with Stan Lee in it.Where to start. Lets start with the casting.Given that the film (roughly) follows on from what went before there would have been no problem in using the same cast to do this movie.In the press it's been stated that Norton was looking for a more cerebral plot. I'd suggest that he should either read the press - where Marvel distinctly stated Ang Lee's film was too cerebral - or sack his agent.Liv Tyler's Betty Ross was about as substantial as tracing paper and I could see no reason for her slipping the glasses on and off as they failed to provide any gravitas.William Hurt delivered some of his lines a'la Jeff Bridges in the Big Lebowski and finally Tim Roth just appeared to be there for the pay check.It surprised me when Leterrier agreed to direct as previous movies have used physical action and not CGI (which was woeful at best making the Hulk look malnourished). This showed as the first scene and the chase across the slums is marvellously directed lulling the viewer into expecting more. It doesn't come.Plot is (well is there a plot) bad to say the least. Why are the army trying to get Banner in the middle of a university campus if this is a top secret operation? Why does every troop seem to know about the operation by the time they hit New York? Why can't the US Army continue a hunt during a storm? Why does Bruce run away from Betty only to give up pathetically on the bridge and why does this film constantly reference the TV series? I could go on but there really is little point. Some Hulk purists may feel in harks to the heyday of this type of Hulk but it should be noted that it was Peter Davids more cerebral Hulk character that saved the comic and actually made the character interesting.Come back Ang Lee, cast and crew. I preferred you!",2,6,13,19 June 2008
Oblivion," Great look and acting but plot holes galore
","Whilst beautifully shot and acted Oblivion suffers from some gaping plot holes which may leave the viewer cold. If even some of these could have been plugged with clever lines of dialogue, and often this is all they need, then the whole film would have been a more impressive and engaging experience. To discuss these more fully we need to consider the big reveal the film offers: The fact the Tet, a vast monolith floating above Earth in order to manage the last evacuation of the planet, is actually an alien hell bent on sucking the planet dry of energy. Having floated into our solar system approximately seventy years prior to events in the film the Tet is encountered by a human ship which is exploring the possibility of colonising Titan. It sucks the ship in and then clones the two woken crew members – sent back as armies to destroy humanity so it can absorb Earth's energy.Immediately a few problems come to mind. Is Earth really the most energy rich planet in the solar system and why has it failed to wipe out mankind by sending down hundreds of drones, clearly seen within the Tet in the final sequences? The excuse that stealth technology has kept the survivors on Earth secure simply failing to hold water for the period they have been in hiding, especially since there is no discussion as to where they are getting their food from.The film revolves around Jack (Cruise) coming to terms with the fact that something is broken in the world. He has no real love with Victoria (a really great performance from Riseborough) and has memories of Earth, and another woman, from well before the war. Jack and Victoria have both had their memories prior to the previous five years removed, something they fail to question to any great degree, or the film fails to explain away well – wouldn't one be concerned about this? As he completes his last tour an ancient Earth ship makes planet fall and Jack disobeys orders to investigate. This is the remains of the ship that the Tet originally pulled Victoria and himself from – the pair ejecting the rest of the crew - and contains Jack's wife. Rescuing her from the drones, who destroy all the other cryogenic pods, Jack starts to remember what happened, assisted towards the very end of the film, by the flight recorder which reminds him what happened. Another plot thread in the film concerns the fact that love transcends all. Jack (a clone) and his wife find some tender moments when she overcomes the fact he isn't quite the same person she originally knew. Jack realising his own state when encountering another clone of himself who is doing the same job he does in a restricted zone. Whilst this plot is played out nicely in the main you wonder how many Jack's are left on Earth? Even though the clone who survives the film events returns to his 'wife' it does beg the question of whether she can accept that a whole bunch more may be arriving from across Earth to return to a normal relationship – something the film decides to ignore, rather than address.In the final sequences Jack and Beech (Freeman) take a vast bomb onto the Tet to blow it to kingdom come. For some reason the Tet does not see the bomb, simply not explained again, and it raises the question of how this vast intelligence has survived so long when it appears to be so stupid.With all these criticisms I go back to the salient points raised, the film looks lovely and is well acted. The only characters I felt were underdeveloped, and could have used more explanation, were Beech and especially Sykes, and understanding the scavenegers (surviving humans) better would have improved the feel of the film. Oblivion has a lot going for it, just don't think too deeply about what is happening.",7,3,4,21 April 2013
The Orphanage," Well Paced and Unnerving Ghost Story
","After seeing the trailer for this movie I had great expectations for the film to follow and, unlike numerous other horror/thriller film trailers, I wasn't disappointed.Unfortunately nowadays you seen an awful lot of tinkering with films, often making the endings make little or no sense, but The Orphanage had none of these. A consistent plot concentrating on the characters and events rather than trying to distract the viewer with red herrings and tricks led to an exceptional, although possibly not surprising, conclusion.Acting was fine from all the ensemble cast and it has been a while since I have been unnerved by anything I have seen in the cinema. Subtitles were also bold but not invasive and did not distract from the films beauty and excellent camera work. Music was used to great effect as well.I felt the final scene was unnecessary however as the scene prior to this allowed the viewer (a'la Taxi Driver) to make their own minds up about the end.This is a minor comment on a wholly excellent film and I will be looking out for the directors subsequent works.As a small aside I saw this during a school holiday and a large number of 15 year olds had come to see the film and were disappointed by the subtitles but - to the films credit - they all stayed to the end and I definitely saw some jumps and cries from them during the movie.",9,5,8,25 March 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Whittaker's finest moment?
","There is not much to add to the excellent range of comments already posted to this movie but having just returned from the cinema I feel I should have my say.Rarely does a film make me wish to read the book, I have usually read this before or have no wish for one media to destroy my images of another, luckily films tend to drift so far from the text you can't usually see the lines.I've always been a fan of Whittaker, being drawn to his style most closely when seeing Ghost Dog and until now I think that was his finest moment. However his dedication to this role, having caught some of the stoic nature and humour of this dictator whilst also showing his fierce, paranoid side makes me consider that he has now outdone himself. Some of the inflexions and facial expressions he uses are so close to the man himself.However a film is not merely the performance of one actor and the whole cast move well under the directors gaze with the two leads playing off each other finely on the screen. Of particular note to myself was Gillian Anderson's role at the start of the film where in a few brief scenes you got a strong feel for a well rounded character.The films style is simple as befits its subject matter, MacDonald using the same locations again and again to show the slow decent into the mire the country is taking under Amin's rule.Music was also effectively used throughout.",8,5,6,13 January 2007
Prometheus," Not quite stolen fire
","There's no point crying over spilt milk and, after the Alien vs Predator outings, you could be forgiven for thinking that there wouldn't be another good movie in either series. With Ridley Scott at the helm Prometheus seemed like the perfect chance; and even with trailer upon revealing trailer you held out hope for the movie.And, for the first two thirds, you were right to.We can skip across performances quickly. Everyone is good, even when the script isn't perfect, but worthy of mention is Fassbender's awesome and creepily logical David, Theron's Vickers and Elba's, long in the tooth, Captain Janek. Rapace is good too, but she is so much in the mould of Ripley she doesn't stand out. If there's one complaint there are too many characters to keep up with and so fine banter is often lost, as the viewer is trying to catch up on each members motivations.Music is oddly upbeat at times, but occasionally harks back to the series that spawned it. Direction and camera work is what you would expect from Scott and his team; simply stunning and often beautiful, even at the moments of true horror. There are even subtle nods to his own original, as well as the sequels (not the AvP Movies).Where Prometheus is let down is with story and editing. Both of these sit reasonably well for the start and middle section of the movie, as long as you accept that none of these scientists have any common sense: Quarantine anyone? As you approach the end, and the inevitable links to the Alien films, the ball is dropped dramatically and continuity falls apart. There is no explanation why the planet visited by the Nostromo is so ravaged, why the planet number listing has changed, why the alien jockey does not die in the correct position on the ship or why the Nostromo failed to recognise the remains of the Prometheus. There is also the scene designed to kill off numerous characters you never knew, making you wonder why they were there in the first place. This may sound like geeky picking but, really, who was this film directed at?Worse still is the editing. When Guy Pearce's oddly accented Peter Weyland is proved to be alive, and on-board, the whole ship seems to accept this without batting an eyelid. There is a rather pointless scene where Vickers is proved to be his daughter, Shaw seems to become close to invulnerable after a major operation and the aliens, who led them to this world, make no sense – especially when you take into account the opening scene. Even David's logic seems to fall through the floor and the whole film gets very jumpy, as if large sections are missing.What Prometheus gives you is a better film than the cinema release of Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection but something that is well off the mark of Scott's own epic and Cameron's sequel. The shame is, with a little bit more thought, it could have been much better. However fans will still enjoy the experience, even if it is just so they can pick holes in it with their friends later.",7,2,7,1 June 2012
