Despicable Me 2," Not so fantastic
","You will find you have enjoyed the movie at the end, just not throughout. How come those guys can make a funny and pleasant ending with cool music, but have trouble repeating this recipe for the whole movie length? You remember going to that club and wondering is this a real DJ? and then right before closing, a younger guy takes the leads and (finally) everybody is like, yeah! this one! and starts jumping around like crazy ? Cut off the boring parts and it's pretty good. Graphics are impressive. Really. The mignons are pretty boring this time sadly. And the scenario is, lets say, like some constipated guy.. now it seems to be working, and then again it blocks. Sorry about the language. You know what I use to do with this? I'm putting through a movie editor software, chop half of it, and then play to my kinds the best parts, so they don't need to ask me 'dad, when is this going to end' at no moment during the film.",7,2,5,16 July 2013
Blade Runner 2049," OK Science-fiction movie on it's own. This is not related to the original Blade Runner from 1982.
","First and foremost the title is a scam. This movie is called '2049', not 'Blade Runner 2049'.This is not a sequel of the Ridley Scott's 1982 movie. It is a different Sci-Fi movie.Ridley Scott has done a one time wonder. He proved he can do a REAL movie, something which was rarely reproduced in the commercial film history. He knew he was spending with his movie both in money and time much more than it was normally allowed for a commercial film meant to make money. Therefore, his 1982 movie was something like a handmade custom build car ordered by a wealthy magnate. Or think of a very expensive, single production handmade timepiece watch. This is why the 1982 movie was never and will never be reproduced, until some oligarch and big fan of the Ridley movie will dispose $1B dollars in actual money to order a new Blade Runner just for his own liking. The 1982 movie had real characters (with the exception of Ford) something specific to the independent movie industry or to foreign films with truly talented directors and actors. It also had this extremely rare quality of pulling yourself from your sofa or theater seat, and literally bring you in a completely new universe and keep you right there almost physically to the point of smelling the running water for the 2 hours of the movie.As for the '2049' movie, it has nothing like the 1982 production. It has superficial characters - OK play overall, but a few miles away from a quality acting and a further few light years from a remarkable performance. All the actors from the Ridley movie are absent, with the notable exception of Ford - which was actually the single problem of the 1982 movie. So basically they kept the single worst aspect of the 1982 movie and put it in the 2049 movie. The power of transporting you in another world from the 1982 movie is absent, the music of Vangelis is absent, the almost 4D sets are absent, the striking characters are gone. Like ... tears.. in rain.",5,11,24,8 October 2017
Gravity," The sub-orbital Titanic movie
","Confusion comes from sudden questioning, how come NASA did hire a guy such as George Clooney? This guy seems more prone to do some Thursday evening bar chatting than concentrate on the real astronauts work.The answer? Take the International Space Station visuals and stick them to a Hollywood script. People don't realize that without the filming in the space environment, this movie script is as complex as the recipe of a donut.Some time ago I was asking my gf why did she like so much horror movies? She said it's because it's giving her emotions. Just for the sake of emotions. Well, this one is giving anxiety emotions and dizziness as a bonus. What is giving me even more dizziness, is how high this movie is rated here on IMDb, along with so many other well achieved cinematographic productions. They also could have called it the long and exhausting labor of Sandra Bullock supported by a disturbingly zen Dr. Clooney. Oh, and I never knew about Sandra's spare time hobbies.. this girl LIKES to crash space stations. Thumbs up girl.Oh, and it's all CGI. It seems the actor's faces and voices are real. To be verified.This film is all technical. Yes, there is some sort of emotion at the ending, I understand it well, but after all this mess of a space ship wrecking chase, it just doesn't pass any more. Save your money, go see a different movie and sneak into the 'Gravity' projecting room in the last three minutes of the movie. That's all you need to see.",4,4,11,7 October 2013
Zootopia," After 1h it gets boring
","For the first 45 minutes I give it a 9/10, for the remaining a solid 5/10 (i.e. typical Hollywood animation quality).Also, not for kids under 10 years old, it has some scary scenes.The first 45 min of the film are good for adults, less so for kids. The remaining isn't good for either one, it like a deflated balloon.For some reason, the first half of the movie managed to pass Disney censorship and rigid mentality, and offer some spicy jokes that will please adults. But what you see in the trailer, only represents the first half time.So leave your 5 years old at home, go in 'matinee' for special theater price, and leave at the 60 minutes mark with no regrets. At least, that's what I did.",5,3,9,18 July 2016
Argo," Poor movie
","The movie moves at a good pace, the street scenes are nicely filmed. The 80's - or rather the late 70's atmosphere is well present in the movie despite somehow simplistic set-ups and presence of spare era elements - cars, clothes, etc.The movie does a poor job of expressive the Iran atmosphere of that era, or at least the daily life or a hint of the culture of Iranian people under the regime, probably because it was filmed on a budget and mostly not on location.So the plot line is quite well written and filmed. What's is shocking is the rave reviews considering the main character play is null. Unless you are a hard core fan of Ben, there is just no play from this character. He has decent play in other of his films, but here it seems he's forcing himself not to show emotions or expressions. The remaining of the cast does an OK job, Goodman is up to the job but all of them seem detached from each other, acting individualistically.There are other historical hostages crisis movies out there, some of them are magical, tense and impregnate with local atmosphere of the specific times. This movie is not even at the bottom of the list.",4,1,1,22 January 2017
The Lego Movie," Ridiculous and not for young children
","What is happening with the script writers at Hollywood? Where are the movies easy and relaxing to watch? I'm not talking about 'White snow' from the 30's, but what is going on with this animation films? They got more and more complex story line, overcharged with script ideas that don't follow, it's like doing a cake and keep trowing in the receipt an endless list of ingredients just because each seems tasteful.To me, this movie shows one and only one thing: the script writers and the producers at Hollywood smoke and not good stuff.Overwhelming, that's the word. Why? Who needs that much? Did we and our kids got retarded and need like some autistic person much more than the usual to get a reaction or satisfaction? My guess is the Hollywood stuff at this days sucks. Just like periodically, you get a smart president, while sometimes you get a poorly qualified one. That's where the entertainment industry is at this point.There were small children in the theater room. I've heard one of them laughing 5 times during the movie, those five moments I recognize were what the entire film should have been. Then I would've call it a nice movie for both kids and parents.Otherwise, having to watch a dizzy endless headless action of Lego pieces for two hours, no thanks, I don't smoke.",2,10,28,18 February 2014
Days of Thunder," Why not? But only 7/10 because it lacks the 'emotions' of Top Gun
","Of course it is not a good movie. But again, it is a Top Gun remake. If there wasn't a Top Gun before, this would have been a nice flop.With Top Gun in mind (the resemblance is obvious, producers wanted a similar film with a different set, it makes this funny to watch.Exaggerated skin color and setup tints, repeated close ups on Tom's pretty and sad/hurt/cocky face, 'fast action' car race scenes, exactly the same receipt as it's predecessor. Sadly, producers forgot two items: first, the love story (sigh), and second, if you can digest the fighter plane questionable acrobatic/fight scenes, it is much harder for Daytona fans to accept the lack of realism of a real race car.The film pace is quite well sustained throughout the film.Nicole is not acting. She just standing or should I say 'postering'Still, nice to watch with some good popcorn or a big hot chocolate on a rainy day, why not?",7,1,2,23 July 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," The producer should have been put in a cereals box and sold
","This movie looks like 4-5 postal cards glued together and sold at a tourists stand on a main street in some city of Europe. What is there besides the occasional nice imagery along with some catchy tracks? This movie is a text book cliché. Or is maybe that it touched many office workers trapped inside their cubicle. Let's see what these guys want the most... oh getting away from sitting in front of the computer and live some exciting life. Hollywood selling dreams since 1910. Not that dreaming isn't great, it's the selling thing that smells. Pretty close to that door sales man pitch.Besides, like said it is a poor movie, there is no story, just a Mountain Film Festival kind of a script and even then we have to wait one hour for a few nice images to show up.What now, are they going to project movies to make the cows forget they are trapped for life inside a massive farm? Wait, that may actually by a good idea.As a side note, what is up with IMDb displaying by default the best reviews of a film? I mean, doesn't that make reading reviews subjective? What if I don't know there is a menu to display the reviews in chronological order? If a movie is poor and I read on the first page only the positive reviews, do I get the right impression on the film?",4,0,2,28 January 2017
K-19: The Widowmaker," Dramatic
","This movie is dramatic, hard to watch, because what you see in the movie is what happened in realty. If you browse Wikipedia about the K-19 submarine, you notice that every detail in the movie is described in Wikipedia. It is troubling seeing the sacrifices.I am not a fan of Harrison Ford outside the Jones character, but if you look to the picture of the real Russian commander, he looks like Harrison Ford! The movie is good because it relates what happened, and it does it so well. Very good filming, acting is not the best because there are several known American actors and it's not easy to imagine them as Russian people. Moreover the main cast in their characters look like too many known American movies.What's not pleasant in this movie, it's the constant melodramatic soundtrack. Someone in Hollywood doesn't understand how art works, it doesn't need to look pitiful to have the spectators emotionally involved. On the other hand it's what made the movie popular for the masses. Would be good to have such movies with a soundtrack OFF option on a DVD edition.",8,1,2,18 January 2014
Ex Machina," Isaac Asimov fans, grab this one
","Someone said it's the best Sci-Fi movie along with Blade Runner. It really isn't the same thing. This is a movie without any kind of action.The dialog is a landmark of human artificial intelligence at least in the movie industry. This is all this movie is about, how do AI machines personality develop. Quite fine observation when the android has trouble making a choice. However I didn't find it 'natural' when the android says 'I'm sorry for your loss'. This emotion was not build on anything a priori. A piece of art, more like reading a book. Watch this movie if you feel like thinking.Finally, I feel they could have gone even more into the thinking of the machine. It somehow lacks the subtlety of Al in the space odyssey. But it's to be understood.",9,8,14,10 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The end of Rotten Tomatoes
","Rotten Tomatoes have done a big mistake: they proved their contributors are the slaves of Disney - I use the world slaves so as I don't have to use more worrying words such as sponsored or under pressure or owing to. This may be the end for Rotten Tomatoes, when a review site is proving that it's reviews are actually under the influence of a particular player of the industry: in such situation the site must disappear as no one is interested in subjective reviews.You see, RT gives this movie a 90%. IMDB gives a more realistic 75% and even then, it's sure IMDB has received many fake votes because it's too easy to have an account and to vote 10/10 without leaving a written review. Aren't all these good marks disturbing when all the reviews posted here on IMDB are abyssal and ditch the movie? So where from are the positive ratings? Thank you Disney, now we know that you have influence on 'independent' critics and that you have people who work for you to leave fake ratings.But you know how I know all this? Simple, I check the reviews on local websites that the film industry is not aware of, websites were only the actual people who have seen the movie rate it. Such site is this one, oh no, the movie is rated only 6.7 from 384 reviewers. What happened? That said, what can I say about the movie itself? I'm writing this is an entirely different manner that all other reviewers. How? Very simple, I'm reviewing this title after putting in my mind that it is not a Star Wars movie, but just another ordinary recent movie. So I'm reviewing it without any thought of an already existing series, or fan base, or existing characters, plot, past success, etc. Another criteria I'm using: I forget about the last 10 minutes in the movie. Why? Because you may have noticed but these days, the directors put out an empty plot but add in the last 5-10 minutes of the movie something spectacular because the people will always keep in memory that last part of the movie and will say it was great because the last minutes were amazing. It's a marketing trick that works well.The movie is not only boring, it simply doesn't have action. Very long scenes with empty talk, by very long I mean 5-10 minutes long scenes with two or three characters that just talk, not important talk, just filling up the time with needless conversation. This is worst than a soap opera, because the cheap talking in a soap opera is still related to some events. The characters are empty of charisma and personality, they are not interesting to watch and you don't attach emotionally to any of them, except to Adam Driver. There is no actual subject in the movie: the characters just sit there like they are waiting for the director to bring the papers with the plot. I am watching this and the soap opera B&B (I'm watching it when I go chat with my step mother! just to make fun of her with that Ridge and Brooke, not to mention Taylor characters) comes to my mind: the soap opera is fun to watch and laugh about it, yet it has some discernible characters with a good presence and a clear personality. I start thinking, this Star Wars movie doesn't even have that. Not even the ultra cheap intrigue of the soap opera is present in the Star Wars. To me this movie is a newspaper: a printed paper, thin as an ordinary paper sheet with the only remarkable attribute being the black on white contrast of the letters.",2,2,5,6 January 2018
Jurassic World," I wasn't moved. But your 14 years old will like it
","It is well done, long and not composed.It doesn't have the suspense of the Spielberg touch. It doesn't have the pleasant and catching story of a Spielberg movie.The animation is good but somehow one notch below the last King Kong movie.It has violence and several violent sudden explicit deaths. Quite more so than previous Jurassic movies. Not for a 10 years old girl to see it.I would rather see it on DVD and skip the long and boring parts.I think it's a flop given the advertising and the expectations. I'm going to wait for Star Wars but I'm afraid I have to learn that good things in the past cannot be revived as easily as the bad ones :(",6,3,8,16 June 2015
Everest," A movie that will satisfy the outdoor lovers and the occasional climber.
","A movie for purists? Certainly no. But a movie that will satisfy the outdoor lovers, the occasional climber and - at least at it's beginning - the trekking crowds.Good news: certainly not a typical Hollywood flick and surely miles away from the rather commercial K2. Surely not the kind of movie I would recommend for unadvised people to go spend a tuesday night with popcorn because this movie contains technical aspects that will make it boring for the crowd.Talking about technical aspects others are better skilled to comment on this. The movie doesn't exactly illustrate the difficulties of climbing above 8000m. It was not shot on the Everest slopes either, as the closer to Everest scenes are filmed at the base camp, and not above.The marking points of the movie are the moments of struggling for live and also the extremely important moment of decision making. I read a bit on the events of the 1996 and I don't remember any passage where the guides were instructing before ascension their clients that when the guide says 'you go back' the clients will have no choice but to obey. I wonder if they instruct this to the clients before the expeditions. Basically, this is the most crucial rule in high altitude climbing, a rule Messner and other great mountaineers followed like a law. No matter how close to the summit - even for a matter of hundreds of feet, no matter how many times the ascension was unsuccessfully tried before, no matter what the financial pressure; when it's time to give up and return, you have to stop and to go back.On the flawed side, I felt the movie was giving too much time to the first 'trekking' part of the expedition, and too little from the moment the storm sets in. The movie also surprisingly skips an important passage when Beck is left for dead to slip alone in a collapsed tent for a night because the climbers in the nearby tents were thinking 'he is going to die any way'. So perhaps not all elements are shown in this film but it's still quite close to the facts. Interestingly, there is a black helicopter scene when Beck is rescued from Camp 1 that is perhaps the best 'risky' helicopter scene I've seen in a movie. This scene almost doesn't belong to the movie, but rather to a Hollywood production. Still, it is awesome. And the cherry on the sundae is this scene is close to the facts. The helicopter that rescued Becks is exactly as the one in the film, and only one passenger was rescued at once because the heli had reached the lift limit.",9,1,2,12 November 2015
Limitless," The scriptwriter forgot it's own pill - could have been a good movie otherwise
","A 7/10 just because the idea behind the scenario is great but someone wrecked the scenario in the process.TONS of spoilers, be aware.The film starts rather acceptable with a 'plausible' plot in the beginning, and for the first 1/3 it's quite well put together. But then it starts incorporating elements - such as the Russian guys, or the erratic love story in distress, or even worst, the illogical death of the modeling girl. The illogical evens just keep going with Eddie not being investigated for the death of Vernon when he was just in the room with the dead body. He makes $12k in a week which logarithmically speaking would have brought him close to $100k in a month and beyond millions in a year so no need to get in trouble with shady people for a 'loan'. More, as mentioned by other reviews, the Russian mafia guy doesn't get his money back, even when Eddie just made 2 million in ten days or so.Then, the more the movie approaches the end, the more they want us to believe many/most/all successful people must also be on this pill. This trashes the movie even more because the movie stands up and it's credible on the initial basis that Eddie was among very few people who had access to the pill. Like we need to trust the story, or if actually many people were on the pill, how comes Eddie was so quickly successful and that was a surprise for everybody? Finally, the way he puts Van Loon at his place is pathetic after during the whole story Van Loon was about the most powerful and fierce businessmen in the room. And then, just to put the cherry on the sundae, we learn that he can actually even see the future.The story plot could have been just as simple as Eddie making a pile of cash out of stock market, then he would have went back to his ex and blind her with all the dough and stuff, go out with her at a nice restaurant and end of the story, everybody's happy - including myself. But no, some bulb head had to mess with the script and make the film look just like a Picasso painting.",7,0,0,19 June 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Poor. A gem stone on a plastic bracelet.
","Of course it's worth more than 2 out of 10. But it's 2 as in frustration. Frustration that the cinematographic school sucks this days. Talent is wasted. Producers are more careless than ever. Only money it's important, quality and achievement have become similar to blue tomatoes.Great decors, good CGI effects, good action scenes.The story line is like a cheap toilet paper that gets stuck you know where, no matter what you do.Take the same movie, chop off completely the story line, put together the action scenes, and there you are, same stuff, enjoyable, and cheaper.",2,26,46,12 November 2013
Unbroken," 'The Passion of the Christ' --- the Angelina Jolie version
","Maybe Angie should hook up with Mel? They both seem attracted to depicting deep human suffering on the screen. I can say, she didn't got the message from the critics of 'The Passion of the Christ'. Please allow me reiterate this message: no matter how hard the moments in someone's life have been, what is the reason to bring this violence on the screen? What does it help to prove/understand? Is public display of real life violence needed? The fact that someone went trough hell, is it a reason to publish it? Is it beneficial in any way? There, of course, might be other explanations for this movie. Someone wants to show us how to be resilient, or even how far the human nature can survive. Or even that no matter what, we have to forgive.I believe a personal story of horror must remain personal in its intimate dimension of what an individual/group of individuals have suffered. Because such suffering has no meaning and no logic. The fact people went through and survived is all in their honor. But not a reason of publishing it.Finally, I hope, just hope, Angelina is not trying to show us here how we should be resilient in life. Because if this was her intention, she must be one individual that is measuring things in an extreme way. Despite the fact the story of the movie is real, by no means this should be taken as an example of how to get through life. The story behind the movie is just too extreme.On the other side, why doesn't the movie show that Louis went into alcohol and depression after the war, yet recovered and started preaching God and forgiveness while being able to completely and sincerely forgive the sadistic commandant? Now that's a human achievement Angelina should have presented in more detail in it's movie.The same movie could have been made in a much softer way, without the atrocity in all of it's details. And could have had perhaps a better impact on the public.",5,3,7,13 January 2015
Godzilla," A review NOT from a hard core fan
","Being that most reviews here are negative and written by fans who want things to be done by the book, I feel like there are also different points of view from people who don't care about the original story and are just looking for entertainment.This Godzilla movie is not bad at all. I don't think any Godzilla movie is a masterpiece, far from that, but this 2014 is a good pop corn disaster colossal yelling monsters hard to put down with conventional weapon artillery. The monsters are well done, the buildings are as solid as tree leaves and crumble in slow motion as it should due to the inertia momentum of heavy materials and there are OK fights between Godzilla and his natural opponents. This 'another scale' fights could have been more dramatic and gory but we feel at all moments that the movie director wanted to preserve the most highrise buildings in the city so perhaps this is the reason why he shortened a little the fights. Plus, how would they manage to clean the streets if there were several artificial lakes of monster blood spilled all over the place. So keep it realistic. Still when Godzilla or some other nuclearily zoomed cockroach sneezes there is little in the way to save in matters of high-rise buildings glasses or some trendy penthouse terraces. Plus, these rather clumsy entities don't care much about keeping moving along the sidewalk like any educated 20th century individual so a certain level of collateral damages similar to those produced by a 9.5 magnitude degree earthquake is naturally to be expected.Finally, we can now easily blame the US army generals, and for a good reason. These guys joggle with nuclear heads like I do with two oranges (when I manage not to drop both of them on the floor). Seriously, trowing in the middle of the city some cracker capable of wiping an area covering several phone area codes then having a soldiers team going to rescue the ticking bomb? Why didn't they just put the toy in a UPS truck just passing by. But even then, Godzilla is still not far away from there, acting around and checking the situation with a more or less attentive eye. He's the real hero, and no, he doesn't drink Coca-Cola when the job is done, nor does he eat at perhaps the only remaining McDonald's in the city. He just takes a dip in the pool, sorry ocean, and swims away like any regular guy in a hot torrid Sunday afternoon. Minus the swimming gear.",7,0,1,4 March 2017
Deadpool," Crude violence, blood and lots of crude swearing
","Really I would have votes twice higher if this wasn't an adult oriented movie. The f** swearing is too much, and the violence (although there aren't many scenes) is brutal. This is no film for kids, obviously but what is disappointing is that it could have been a cool funny movie.Because it mixes crude violence with humor, it seems like some creep/weird movie.The good side is that it's well composed and well focused on the main hero while not retaining 'clichés' or annoying lengthy parts.If they do a second one I hope they will give up violence and language and give us a nice humorous flick.",4,35,80,13 February 2016
The Martian," Ridley, Ridley
","You, lucky guy. One day you got stamped Blade Runner on your forehead and we get distracted by this when there is a new flick with your name showing up on screens. Well, no longer for me. I praise you for the 1982 film, but that will be all. Maybe back then you had a good team, a more flexible budget, or more freedom from the producers. Not going to call you a one wonder hit, only by respect for the quality of the movie that is still linked today to your name.But ever since, things (movies) were all of the same unnoticeable artistic achievement. Yes there have been some Oscars along the way. But Oscar means more blockbuster vibe than artistic accomplishment.Nothing new with the Martian either. Except maybe the plot is something more of a theater play. Dry in action, emotions, suspense, novelty. It feels like Mars. Dry and lifeless. As lifeless as this long term traveling space ships interior design.There are however moments when something seems to be happening. There are some potential powerful emotional moments but they get scrapped. For example, when he gets off Mars and is about to return to the ship that will get him back home, what a potentially powerful and magical moment to catch his emotions as he sees humans for the first time after such a long period. Instead, the film chooses to replace such scene some useless last-moment out of the frame action event. Why? Why replacing such a moment that has built up from the beginning of the movie with some cheap action? It's like throwing in the garbage bin a $500,000 Pre-Columbian statue that you carelessly bough off a garage sale because it didn't match your dining room walls color.",3,7,14,17 October 2015
