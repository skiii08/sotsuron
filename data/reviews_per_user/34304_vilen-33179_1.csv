Hereditary," Truly Unsettling
","This was a remarkable movie with some truly jaw dropping moments. This is not a bloody slasher, but a movie that has a creeping unease. I can truly say after seeing this movie on opening day (yesterday) that I have not been able to stop thinking about it. There are some truly jaw dropping moments. Beautifully shot, phenomenal acting, well executed. This movie has kept me thinking about it long after its ending. This is the 2nd time I have felt the need to review a movie in the 11 years I have visited IMDB, if that says anything.I was impressed, and that happens RARELY. Go watch this movie.",10,31,63,9 June 2018
