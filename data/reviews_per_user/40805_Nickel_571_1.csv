The Longest Yard," Sooo funny!
","I don't know what is the matter with some people, but come on! Not all movies are created to be Oscar contenders, remember the good old days when we watched movies for entertainment? That's all this movie was ever meant to be, entertainment! It is extremely funny. Everyone in the theater was practically rolling in the aisles, and yes men and women found this movie funny. Yes, a lot of the humor is rather sophomoric, and I for one could use a dose of pure laughter from pointless things from time to time. I'm so tired of everyone judging movies based on how realistic and dramatic they are. I thought the whole point of film and television was to escape the reality of our everyday lives. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock have a great comedic chemistry and timing, probably left over from their SNL days. Here's a little advice, if in the first five minutes of this movie you're not laughing your butt off, do yourself a favor and GET UP AND LEAVE because this won't be your kind of movie. So if you like to laugh and you could care less about the Oscars this movie will suit you just fine!",10,1,3,1 June 2005
