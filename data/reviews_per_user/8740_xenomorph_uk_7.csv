The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Unimaginative, basic and sterile
","Do you remember when you were a kid and your parents were constantly on you to wash the dishes. So you'd spend the next hour using every excuse in the arsenal to avoid it. Eventually, you'd relent and grudgingly do your duty. Of course, you'd ensure that you made a complete mess of the entire thing. You'd deliberately leave some dishes a little dirty, splash water and soap everywhere and perhaps even go as far as chipping a dish or two, all in the hope that if you did a bad enough job, you'd never be asked to do the dishes ever again...... well, I'm pretty sure that's what they were going for when they made Mocking Jay.The movie grinds its way slowly from one over-analysed scene to the next with very little in the way of exciting set-pieces in-between. I believe the running time is perhaps this movie's biggest enemy as most scenes were heavily drawn out and padded with needless and dull dialogue. There were a number of scenes that were clearly supposed to be tense and gripping, but failed miserably.The entire movie is just so underwhelming and should have been better!I love sci-fi. It's without a doubt my favourite genre. It doesn't take much to satisfy my sci-fi needs. However, in my humble opinion, The Hunger Game : Mocking Jay is perhaps one of the worst big budget sci-fi movies made in recent years.",3,33,53,22 November 2014
Sucker Punch," I thought it was fantastic
","This is certainly one of my favourite action movies in recent years. It's pretty clear from the commercials that they're targeting a largely male audience and from that standpoint, it doesn't fail to please. There have been many recent movies that are clearly targeted at the female audience such as the Twilight series, Red Riding Hood etc... so we've earned this one ;)First of all, I was thoroughly impressed by the sets and attention to detail. The level of originality is extremely high with lots of mixed technologies and eras. The sound track was absolutely spot on. It's rare to find a score that fits and actually intensifies the various scenes. Sure, the acting was pretty poor to average, but was frankly just about what I expected. Despite that I found that I cared about some of the main characters and found them quite interesting. The story is pretty open-ended and leaves you to make your own mind up about much of what transpired. The transition scene from asylum to brothel is a little abrupt though and leaves you somewhat displaced for a while. Overall, I got exactly what I expected and more from this film. Fun action, original scenes and some seriously hot eye-candy ;) Most guys around my age will definitely enjoy this title.

Shrek Forever After," The second best one... so far.
","In a nutshell, better than the second and third movies, but not as good as the first.It wasn't nearly as funny as I expected. At first I figured this was due to a fairly empty auditorium (you know how infectious laughter can be). Then I began wondering if perhaps I was just becoming too old and long in the tooth for that particular brand of humour. Finally it dawned on me that much of my own amusement was diluted by the fact that I'd seen most of the funny bits already... on the movie trailers.Shrek 4 is yet another victim of the trailer curse, which definitely seems to ruin comedies more than any other movie type. As per usual, the two trailers I'd seen before finally catching the movie, seemed determined to show all of the laugh-out-loud moments.Have you ever noticed that comedies such as Knocked Up and The Hangover are so much more successful and talked about simply because the trailers show far less (in Knocked Up's case, they used just one scene).Anyway, Shrek 4 was entertaining enough despite the afore mentioned issue. I did laugh out loud a couple of times as did most others in the cinema. The story is fun and quite clever. The voice acting is top notch as always and the animation is as fantastic as you'd expect.So if by some miracle you can avoid the movie trailers then I expect you'll enjoy this movie more than I did. Otherwise, watching this fun bit of animation isn't a bad way to spend an afternoon :)",6,3,5,15 July 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Sony-Man!
","Yes, it was abundantly clear throughout the movie which company bankrolled much of the production ;) Anyway, smashing movie and considerably better than I was expecting! When I saw the trailer for this about a month ago, my first thought was 'They're remaking it already?' Having now seen the movie, it's not really a remake... more of a great reboot.In my personal opinion, Garfield is a far better, really likable and downright more fun Peter Parker (not that Maguire wasn't any good). His goofy character was entertaining and certainly added a few stars to the rating. The casting crew did a great job when they selected him and did themselves proud with the rest of the cast as well.I was also delighted that the writers focused more on the character development and did not rely exclusively on neat CGI tricks (something that many movies of late cannot claim to have achieved). The plot was fairly basic and was guilty of the odd Hollywood clich√©, but was enjoyable enough, easy to follow and complimented the characters well.Emma Stone was an ideal love interest. She was delightful and had just the right amount of screen time (as did most of the cast), as not to detract from Garfield's story. The chemistry was believable and appeared genuine.The CGI was really solid and they tried some new techniques to differentiate the movie from the 2002 original. There are some great sequences where we see the world from Spider-man's point of view, as he swings around mid-town. It gives you an appreciation of his incredible abilities and how just how fast he moves.It really doesn't matter if you're a comic book fan or not, this is a great wee film and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.Now... I'm off to buy a Sony Xperia. ;)",7,0,2,10 July 2012
Super 8," UK Revolt!
","This is a personal protest against the fact that the UK will not be able to see this movie for a full two months after the rest of the world. Why are we being made to wait so long while pretty much every other country gets to enjoy it first? It's dumb ideas such as this one that leads to piracy. Anyone here who was considering buying a cinema ticket will now most likely be downloading it illegally... rather than waiting two months.I can understand this sort of studio reasoning with minor titles, but this is a major release. What are they thinking! Is this some kind of insult aimed at the UK cinema audience?When it is eventually released here, I will not be going to see it nor will I be buying any other JJ Abram bluray titles or cinema tickets. This is just unacceptable.",1,6,16,13 June 2011
Prometheus," Please let there be a director's cut...
","I'm pretty sure there's at least 30-60 minutes worth of missing footage. It's the only explanation I have for Scott making such an average sci-fi. Look, I know there's debate, is it a prequel or not. That doesn't matter, what does is the quality of this movie versus the rest of the Alien genre.I remember the sheer thrill of Alien 1979 version. The highly original Xenomorph stalking its human prey throughout the dark confines of the Nostromo. The incredible sequence as Ripley sets the vessel on self-destruct only to find her path to the escape boat blocked by the vicious alien. Then the mad terrifying scramble to deactivate the fusion plant followed by an even more intense attempt to reach the lifeboat for a second time. Then after all that, the Xenomorph had sneaked on-board anyway! Weaver's utterly convincing terror as she slips into the spacesuit and blows the airlock. Just incredible! Horror/Sci-fi at its very finest and best. True 'On the edge of your seat', stuff.My point... Prometheus had none of this... not a shred! Sure, Prometheus was beautifully shot and visually stunning, but the movie was full of poor editing, plot holes and flawed acting. I just can't imagine Scott allowing the film to be created this way and I'm convinced the Editing Room and writers are responsible for the disjointed nature of the movie. I won't delve into the many plot holes or describe the childish nature of the script/plot devices as you've no doubt read many other reviews by now.Despite its flaws it's still a worthwhile sci-fi and deserves the price of a cinema ticket. You'll be blown away by Fassbender's performance and also Raprace's to a point. The CGI really is beautiful and there's some pretty neat ideas about how the Xenomorph evolved. It's definitely a movie that'll find its way into my blu-ray collection in a few months time.",6,303,536,2 June 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," The wife owes me big time!
","It took my wife nearly a week of constant begging to take her to see Eclipse. After having endured the first two movies and the subsequent years of self therapy to erase the memory, it took a lot of persuasion to guilt trip me into seeing this one as well.Needless to say, I entered the movie theatre mentally preparing myself for two hours of torture. Frankly, Eclipse was just as bad as I had expected despite reassurances from female co-workers that 'It is much better than the last one... honest.' I've never read the books nor do I plan to. I know nothing of the author however, I'm guessing she started writing this stuff when she was a twelve year old girl with delusions of what love should be.This entire movie is nothing more than a very poorly written romantic dilemma, wrapped in a weak premise of vampire and werewolves in an attempt to lure extra interest. So far as stories go this one has no vigour or power what-so-ever. Depth? I've stepped in deeper puddles.Approximately 80% of this movie is dedicated to examining the lead female's conflicting emotions. Does she want the vampire or the werewolf? Does she understand the lifestyle choice that comes with that decision? Is she willing to accept the risks? Does she understand the impact it will have on those around her? And finally... does anyone at all actually care? Yup, for two whole hours. (Six if you include the first two).So surely this movie has some redeeming features? Perhaps the acting? Wrong. Stewart's (Bella), emotions range from mildly irritated to slightly concerned whilst trying to maintain an air of vulnerability that irritates instead of earning sympathy. For Pattinson (Edward), it's all about just looking pretty and his acting skills are reduced to nothing more bowing his head slightly so that he always appears to be gazing upwards in an attempt at looking intense. As for Lautner (Jabob), well we all know he can't act so he is reduced to a shameless and topless eye-candy prop.In summary? Women are from Venus and men are from Mars. If you're a guy, you'll hate this. If you're a woman... you might like it. I'm not trying to belittle the sexes, it's just that type of movie.Anyway, the wife can beg all she wants... there ain't no way I'm taking her to see the fourth one!",2,441,605,15 July 2010
