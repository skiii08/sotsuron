The Avengers," Great fun which exceeds expectations but disappoints as it doesn't live up to all the hype...
","So here we are now. After years of development and a few film establishing the main characters, we get to see a team of superheroes being, well, a superhero super group. My initial response was of dread as I could not see it working well but to my surprise it is one of the most entertaining films of the year.With Earth being under attack from dastardly villain Loki and his evil plot to rule Earth and its inhabitants, it is down to Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) to pull together his group of superheroes to save the human race. Luckily for those of you who have seen all the individual films, the need for each characters origin and development is unnecessary as they have been fully established in their own stories.The film does start off very well and establishes a plot (although very well worn) about an attempt by Loki (main villain from Thor), to take a mysterious cube (the Tesseract) which harnesses a power that can open a teleport/wormhole to allow an alien army which he commands to take over the world. Even with this simplistic and over familiar storyline the film has many entertaining moments and is littered with loads of Whedons trademark witty one liners.The one truly great thing about this film is how well it manages all the superheroes characters and never does one character feel like it's just a film about them with a few extra superheroes tagging along. Each one of them have a similar amount of screen time and a specific purpose which drives the plot forward. Another thing is that the guy behind the film (Whedon) knows his material and creates a loving, authentic and workable story which means each character never feels like a bit character. A very balanced juggling act which allows the stars to shine and show their unique personalities.The only minor criticism I would give is the over hype that this picture has garnered by many and judging by it's box office record breaking takings, people are going in their droves to see what all the fuss is about. Don't get me wrong, the film is good but not an all time classic. The plot is nothing new, and the alien invasion at the climax of the film is a bit reminiscent of Transformers 3, and a team that doesn't get on but eventually stand together and realize a common enemy, all very clichéd.",8,1,4,19 May 2012
Skyfall," A Bond for a new era
","A James Bond film made for the modern era, you'd be hard pressed to find any other film series able to stand the test of time and still feel relevant. When it looks like it's lagging behind the competition of the other spy action thrillers, the makers have taken note and re-invented the mould, making it more real and exciting.To me, Bond had too much of a rigid formula, the cars, the chases, the girls, the gadgets, the megalomaniac villain's and the spectacular set pieces/stunts. After a while though, the older films seem to suffer from a sense of deja vu. It's a case of been there, done that. The structure of the films have become stale and repetitive. Same plot about a group of criminals/organisation hell bent on world domination/destruction, with a beautiful bond girl in tow, Bond and or Bond girl gets capture, ridiculous car chase or stunts with a million of cheesy one liners. Frankly, I had pretty much given up on the Bond films. They have become predictable and tedious with only the change of location to give the film any sort of distinction.The plot of Skyfall is unlike previous Bond films, starts with the routine chase resulting in Bond being shot and wounded, believed to be dead by MI6. When an attack on MI6 headquarters manifest through a cyber attack and a bombing at the headquarters, Bond returns to uncover who is behind the assault. Struggling from his gun shot wound, Bond has to prove his fitness mentally and physically through some rigorous tests. Sent back into action without being fully fit, Bond embarks on the mission to expose the mastermind. What Bond discovers is a villain who happens to be ex-agent who has a vendetta against M and will stop at nothing to kill her.First thing you'll notice is the lack of gadgets and the usually bond girl (there is one of sorts but you'll understand when you watch it). Also with a villain who is suave yet as equally menacing as Hannibal Lector, we have a loose cannon who isn't after the world but revenge. It's spy vs spy and the story is more of a evolution of the characters that inhabit the world of Bond. Nods to older Bond films crop up from dialogue, props and even the classic Austin Martin car makes an appearance. It's a homage as well as a resurrection of well known characters.What we are given here is a Bond with more layers to him and more emotions. Daniel Craig has moulded a Bond who is more relateable. Signs of physical and emotional weakness shows us a Bond who is no longer a super spy with little or no vulnerability. Other characters are given more screen time and provide an emotion gravitas (We are also introduced to Q, a young model who is still wet behind the ears).In the hands of Sam Mendes and Director of photography Roger Deakins, there has never been a more beautiful shot Bond film. During Bond's fight with a criminal minion we see only their silhouettes, but the eye is drawn to the beauty of the neon Shanghai backdrop. The reserve can be said for the grime, dour and rainy streets of London which captures our the United Kingdom perfectly.It's a satisfying and enjoyable film, with plenty of action and a surprising emotional core to the narrative. A great development in characters with seeds being sown to allow for a more relateable and mature story telling and for future characters to come to the fore. Skyfall has made me fall in love with Bond films again so here's hoping there's no more rigid formula and routine mundane narratives of past.",8,65,108,2 February 2013
Iron Man 3," Shane Black's take on old red and yellow shiny boots
","The third in the ever increasing popular Iron Man series, follows on from the enormous Avengers film where we find Tony Stark having to battle anxiety attacks and sleepless nights from his experiences fighting extraterrestrials in New York. Not able to cope or fully recover, Stark hides himself amongst his suits and gadgets neglecting his partner Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow in a more substantial role this time around). The story starts though with a flashback, going back to 1999, before Stark became Iron Man.The events that unfolds, informs us of how a budding young scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) comes to Stark with a new idea which unfortunately, he dismisses, this in turn results on his past decisions coming back to haunt him... Fast forward to the future and there is a more imminent danger in the form of The Mandarin (played with great joy and humour by Sir Ben Kingsley), who targets the US and threatens to kill civilians via bombings.Stark ignores the publicity and news on the Madarian and doesn't see it as his duty to get involve but when his ex-bodyguard Happy Hogan (Favreau), becomes one of the latest victims and suffers from major injuries, Stark issues a threat on national news and announces his address to Mandarin which was an unfortunately the wrong thing to do.....There is quite a bit of substance to the story and there is a some choice dialogue littered throughout the film. Not really surprising come from the director Shane Black. Anyone who is familiar with his screenplays will know he has some killer quotable lines (just check out The Last Boy Scout or Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Stark is once again imbued with great charm and retorts, but it isn't only the heroes who come out with funny dialogues, even the henchmen come out with some comedic lines.This is a much improvement compared to the last film, which did feel a little tired and more of warm up towards the big gathering of superheroes that was The Avengers, this time around Downey Jr is given more of a job of acting, instead of just his face in a helmet. The film's logically progression is to show what he can do with out his powers, or in this case his multi million dollar suits and gadgets....which is of course to rely on his wits and charm.It's probably fair to say that this is more of Tony Stark movie than an Iron Man film. That's not to say it's a bad thing. There are still some amazing set pieces within the film to satisfy the action junkies (most notably standout would be the multiple passengers rescue in mid air). The plot just feels more meaningful and thought out. If this is to Downey's Jr last stint as Iron Man (he will reprise the role in the forthcoming Avengers sequel), this is a good send off to a character he has made his own and anyone looking to step into those red Iron boots, will have a hellava job to match (let alone improve) his interpretation.read more of my reviews here: http://fsfilm.blogspot.co.uk/",8,1,2,9 May 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," JJ Strikes Back
","The 2nd instalment of the new generation cast to cement their feet into the shoes of well established characters, settings and the famous ship, the Starship Enterprise. In the hands of JJ Abrams, the franchise is on the right course to expand and attract new fans. There will always be the die hard fans (and I'm not talking about the Bruce Willis films here guys!) who will object to their beloved characters and universe going in a different direction or in a particular style.This is a reboot, get over it. If people are so objectionable over the way the Star Trek mythology is handled you can go back to your Star Trek: The Motion Picture and your Star Trek Insurrection's and remember how dull and awfully slow they were. Those films will never be able to convert non fans to the franchise but this one and the previous chapter will, I for one, am on board and can not wait to see how things continue you develop. The sequel opens up with a bang as the crew (and the audience) are hurtled straight into danger. Kirk and co, are on a planet trying to save it's alien inhabitants from an erupting volcano. When things call for a drastic and immediate decision, Kirk disobeys Star Fleet code of ethics and saves the day. Unfortunately his superiors (and Spock) do not agree. Believing he will be assigned to a 5year exploration of deep space, he is instead call up to be reprimanded and loses his captaincy of the ship. Meanwhile in London, we are introduced to the mysterious John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) who coerces a Star Fleet Officer with a promise to save his dying daughter for an exchange of a favour...I could go on with the plot, but it's safe to say it's up to the crew to stop Harrison's plot and there are plenty of twist and turns which will keep the viewers on their seat. All the cast return and put on their best impersonation of these well loved (and known) characters, some getting more screen time (Scotty) while others are reduces to little dialogue and actions (Sulu, Chekov and Bones) but that isn't really a criticism. If the characters were all given the same or more things to do, the film's run time would easily exceed 3+ hours. As it is, most of them are reduced to what their designated status and skill sets are to progress the plot's natural progression.The main leads do perform an admirable display and imbue their characters with a lot of depth and emotion. There is a genuine connection that the audience can feel between Kirk and Spock. Benedict Cumberbatch's villain is a great deal more than a maniacal menace. There is a reason for his vengeance against Star Fleet and there is a great deal of control to his performance which is never over the top and provides the viewer with sympathy to his cause.There are nods and winks to the Star Trek lore, (with the most apparent coming near the end) and there is an utter respect to the old films and series. Things which both old and new fans can both enjoy and appreciate. What is totally different is the pacing of theses films. There isn't many scenes where some explosion or action sequence is on show, but that is punctuated with very talky, science fiction dialogue as it cuts back and forth between action and drama. It works very well.Is this a better film than the previous effort. No. It's a continuation to the series which opens up many doors for it's characters and world to go into. It's a solid encounter for the crew of the Enterprise with a very polished finish (lens flair still intact!). It's an entertaining ride with some great touches of humour and dramatic performances, with plenty on offer for everyone.",9,5,15,14 May 2013
The Prestige," Are YOU watching closely...?
","A film about magicians, friendship, jealously and rivalry. It's very hard to sell this film and to try to explain it without giving too much of the (pardon the pun) 'magic' away. A tale of two magicians set in Victorian England where their friendship turns sour when an act they routinely perform goes horribly wrong. The pair part company and a rivalry ensues. A bitter feud emerges when they both try to outdo each other with an array of tricks and illusions. From the outset it may seem like this film is all about magic and the art of illusion, but it isn't.Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film follows a similar structure to his previous effort Memento where the narrative doesn't start at A and follow on to B. Instead there is flashbacks and flash forwards, as the reveal and revelation is slowly bought forward. We embark on a merry-go-round where we are left guessing where it stops and where we get off, but the level of intrigue that it creates just keeps you wanting more. To truly enjoy, appreciate and most importantly understand the film, your attention is required from start to finish and focus must be retained throughout. It's not a film you can switch off and come back to.From the off, we are given an explanation of the three part structure to every major trick, the pledge, the turn and the prestige. The prestige is the final reveal, the re-appearance from a disappearing act, making the impossible seem possible... What follows is a trail where the magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) accused of murdering his rival Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). From there on in the story unfolds with Borden reading Angier's diary where the first flashback occurs and the start of complex twists and turns showing how they started out as friends and with the eventual fall out which turns them to bitter rivals, with Angier trying to uncover how Borden achieves his greatest magic trick 'the transported man' and out do him.Funnily enough, this film so weirdly different and it's not what you'd expect. It set in Victorian England yet it never once feels like a period drama. Detail is key, as the focus is with the characters and never the background. Of course the costume and setting provides the backdrop for the story but the main theme is about obsession.Both leads (Bale and Jackman) are on fine form and the rest of the supporting cast raises the bar. The performances are subtle and sublime, with the nuances and deliberate misdirection to mislead us into thinking who we see as the bad guy may not be the villain of the piece. That isn't to say that there is a villain but nothing is ever clear in this wonderfully realised screenplay.Such an understated film with much to get your brain cells a work out, there's a lot to take in and you may not see everything the first time round but as the first lines mentions 'are you watching closely?' there is a lot to admire about how the whole thing is constructed and like any great magic trick, the film only allows the audience enough details to carefully reveal the smaller pieces of a puzzle where we, the audience have to fit together to see the bigger picture. Is what we see the real truth or is there something more otherworldly, supernatural or unexplainable. With elements of science fiction thrown in you wonder whether things can get any weirder but when the final act is revealed you may well feel cheated or left feeling a sense of wonderment and just like a magic trick, you think to yourself, how did they pull that off? if you liked my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com",10,3,5,17 April 2011
21 Jump Street," unexpectedly funny!
","First off, I don't normally go for comedies but as I find myself in LA waiting for a flight departing in 8 hrs I had a plenty of time on my hands. Went off to the local multiplex and found not much on, my choices were The Lorax, John Carter, 21 Jump Street amongst others. So I opted for what I thought was the best of a bad bunch and went to see 21 Jump Street.I had little knowledge of this film only that it is a update of an old TV show from the 80s and that it now follows more of a comedic route than it's origins. It stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as two young high school kids from the opposite spectrum of the popularity scale. Schmidt (Hill) is a geek who doesn't get to go to prom and is ridiculed by his fellow students whereas Jenko (Tatum) is the typical high school jock who is popular with everyone and believes he will be crowned the prom king until he finds he's is unable to attend due to his poor grades. So far so predictable.After graduation, they both enrol in the police force and Jenko spots the opportunity to team up with Schmidt to pass the police exam to become fully fledged police officers. They form a friendship and become partners. No plot surprises there, but what does come through is the two leads energy and exuberance. The two stars provide an engaging and very strong performance which I must admit caught me by surprise (especially from Tatum, who knew he could do comedy so well?).As they bumble through a routine arrest the police force believe their youthful appearance would work well in their special unit called 21 Jump Street. The main directive of this special task force is to infiltrate high schools and tackle a new synthetic drug being dealt to students. They embark on the undercover project and it's here where the majority of the comedy comes about. A mix up occurs and as a result they are forced to pretend to be one another's pre-assigned undercover identities, one an athlete and the other a science nerd and the previous natural roles undertaken in their own teen years are finally broken.It's safe to say the jokes do come thick and fast and there is many a moment when I found myself laughing out loud. What is surprising about the whole film isn't the actual assignment but the characters chance to relive their high school experiences and their journey to correct past mistakes and in essence play a different role. You begin to care less about the sub-plot of the drug ring they are suppose to smash and become more emotionally involved with the two characters predicament and self discovery.I can safely say that this film is an absolute blast, which is more hit than miss on the joke front. A film with little in they way of expectations has become a surprise hit as a result. So less said the better (sometimes a film's trailer will give away all it's best moments but there are so many great funny scenes it would be impossible to do this!). I was very impressed by Tatum as I would never have expected him to do so well in a comedy performance and if this was anything to go by, he'll have something else to fall back on if his tough guy action roles dry up.",9,1,3,19 May 2012
The Thing," It wants to be US!
","A delightful and charming story about a visitor from another world who lands on Earth and comes in contact with several humans whilst trying to find a way home....And this, is another film where an alien being, comes down and takes the form of several humans (and dogs) trying to disguise itself and avoid being found to then return home. How similar are ET and The Thing? Both are made in 1982, both are about alien visitors and both films show the obstacles faced in their plight to return home. Well, I suppose one film is more sickening than the other (I mean how much mush, sentimentality and sweetly sick story can one person take?) But enough about E.T, The Thing has become something of an underground classic during the heydays of VCR rentals, where it's outstanding scenes can be paused and rewound to be watched over and over again. Some of the scenes within the film are jaw-dropping and it's all done pre-CGI. It's amazing what could be done in those early days of creature animatronics.The Thing is directed by John Carpenter and is probably one of his best, but unfortunately it was not a hit. A remake of sorts (John Carpenter was hugely influenced by Howard Hawks) however this is an altogether different beast. Set in Antartica, an American expedition group are interrupted one day by gunshots from a far. A couple of Norwegians are firing at a husky from a helicopter. With sporadic gunfire, one of the American scientists takes a shot in the leg. Shots are fired in response and as a result the Norwegians are killed. The dog is taken in and held with the other dogs in the camp. Unbeknown to the American group, the Husky is not what he seems. Eventually the team set out to discover why the pair of Norwegian were shooting at the dog and what they find out is beyond their darkest nightmares.The plot isn't anything original as the group is picked off one by one until there is one man standing (or in this case two), with it's remote location it's very similar to another classic sci-fi horror that is Alien....but where Alien only really has one complete genuine gross out moment, The Thing has so many that it's a wonder when you see the first gruesome transformation how they can top it... but they do. The whizkid at the time (Rob Bottin) deserves so much praise as his effects beat anything that modern special effects can bring to our screens. He was also only 21! The central themes on what makes us human and the loss of identity is dealt with in vivid detail. As men in joining the tribe we gain a sense of belonging but as a result we lose personal identity. Paranoia and trust are tested to the limit. Characters start turning on each other, they begin shooting and eventually resort to tying up one another. In one of the films more lighter moments, they devise a test to see who is human and who is not, from this comes one of the most memorable and perfectly delivered lines. There is relief amongst all the bodily gore.The technical achievements in this film is what makes it so watchable. The score by Ennio Morricone is a haunting yet deliberate heartbeat which is minimalistic yet menacing. One of the only films where Carpenter hasn't had an input on the scoring, but nevertheless Morricone's approach is very suited and matches and enhances the films eerie atmosphere.There is a lack of character development within the film (that is the only flaw I can say), and it seems that Kurt Russell's character (MacReady) is the only one who is given enough personality for us to root for. The majority are unfortunately given the basic stock character traits, though the acting by all is well above average, there isn't enough depth to them.With a tight a script, direction and amazing effects work by Rob Bottin's crew (never has intestinal and flesh mesh been so beautifully realised), it has still stood the test of time and is always a joy to watch. One of my all time favourite films.",10,1,2,9 April 2011
Before Sunset," A worthy Sequel that improves on the original
","The second feature in Richard Linklater's exploration at romantic love in which we are re-united with the characters we were first introduced to, back in 1995, in Before Sunrise. Reprising their respective roles are Ethan Hawke (Jesse) and Julie Delpy (Celine). We are invited to catch up on their lives 9 years later and straight away we feel like we're catching up with old friends.For those of you who have not seen the first feature, at the end of that film, both promised to meet each 6 months later but the meeting never took place. Almost a decade later we find Jesse (an author now,who's written a book based on his experiences in Vienna) on the launch of his book in a bookstore in Paris. The film opens up with Jesse explaining his theory and his ideas of his own book. By coincidence Celine happens to be in the very same book store. What follows is a brief encounter where they go to have coffee and converse over matters and topics like their lives and the reasoning why they never got to meet up.As they wander through the streets of Paris they talk about what had happened, the camera slowly follows them as they talk and catch up on events. This one, like the previous effort, the dialogue and performance is main focal point and drive in the narrative. Issues which both character have passions for, are vocal discussed in an expressive and devoted manner like the environment. In the little time Jesse has before he his flight leaves, they connect like they did before as they come to realise that this sort of connection is a rare thing in life. The way in which they talk is so relaxed and comfortable in feels so effortless and never contrived.With this film being set almost a decade later it differs from the fact they have moved on and their lives have changed but they realise that there is some chemistry and undeniable attraction towards each other. Gone are the ideals of young love and blossoming relationship, here we see two people reconnecting and finding nothing has changed in what they found so attractive about each other.What is technical, a remarkable achievement, is the way the film unfolds in very long shots which captures the naturalist and authentic performances in the streets of Paris. The dialogue is as ever, free flowing, witty, entertaining, funny and never feels like they're reading from a script. The writing duties on this film is credited to both leads (and director) which shows their acting never feels like acting, past experiences and events in their real lives seem interwoven into the story. With the ever setting sunset, the film captures an illuminating yellow tint which gives the overall tone and feel a glowing radiant beautiful shine. It feels like a metaphor on their relationship. The sun maybe setting but there is a beautiful glow like the heart beating on and love still resonating.A journey which unfolds in real time and with two likable actors who portray two people in a very honest and romantic way in picturesque setting of Paris. Little nuances from unspoken words to glances and physical touches all adds to the depth of realism. And in the way in which the film ends, well... maybe there's more to their relationship to discover and more to their journey but when it ends, we left with 'what ifs' and 'what now'. A tantalising ending, full of promise and hope.",10,0,0,15 August 2011
Drive," A Modern Western
","Drive. A simplistic title for a movie where the lead character main asset is his driving abilities and from this point it may seem like the plot would be all about cars and driving fast. Luckily there is more to this than going 0-60 in 3 seconds.A narrative which is based on classic westerns themes, a nameless hero who falls for a local woman and gets mixed up with the wrong crowd and endeavours to make things right. Except this is located in modern LA and his speciality is his driving skills. Ryan Gosling plays our nameless hero who is a getaway driver for hire and a stuntman and mechanic by day.The opening scene shows us his impressive talent and his quiet, strong persona that commands the screen and grabs our attention immediately. He is impressive when he talks and equally brooding when he doesn't. The nameless protagonist is cool, calm and collective. His life is simple and with little or no desires only to carry out his job and to do it well... that is, until he comes into contact with Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her son, his neighbours.They become friends and connect through unspoken glances and Gosling's character feels an emotional connection with Irene and her son Benicio. The Driver has found something that has been missing in his life but unfortunate that is short lived as Irene husband is released from jail and he is in heavy debt to some very dangerous men who intend to collect one way or another.With the film shot in a highly stylised way you'd be forgiven in thinking it's all just flash in the pan, fast edits with little or no substances to character or story but in fact the opposite is true. With a mesmerising soundtrack and a very authentic 80's feel to it, the director has made it feel cool and never contrived. Even down to the opening titles, a pink neon typography adds to the appeal.The strongest focal point to the film is Ryan Gosling's portray of the lead character. As mention before he comes across as strong and passionate man with little or no weakness. A believability and a measured control of his emotions allowing a remarkable performance where he can show you what he is feeling without saying any words. Fine support comes from Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad) as his only friend/companion.I warn those of a weak disposition that there are some gruesome acts of violence amongst the beautiful shot imagery. If anything, you won't forget the contrasting image of a kiss and a skull being smashed in the same shot. A haunting and powerful film with an outstanding performance from Gosling, one of the best film of 2011.",10,2,5,2 February 2013
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A memory wipe of a film that just stays with you....
","A film that defies an easy explanation in terms of plot is attached with an equally less revealing title. What is the 'Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind'? Well, it stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in what I can only describe as a surreal romantic comedy drama from the inventive minds of Charlie Kaufman and the visionary French music video director Michel Gondry.The film opens with Joel Barish (Carrey) narrating that today is Valentines day. Bored of his usual routine, he spontaneously gets on a train heading the other way to his work and there stumbles upon Clementine (Winslet). They strike up a conversation and apart from the odd hiccups they get along. Little do either of them know, they were partners before and as the plot unravels we begin to realise that both had decided to wipe their memories of each other.The narrative goes back to when Joel wakes up after an argument with Clementine the night before. He goes to try to smooth things over, only to find that Clementine doesn't recognise him at all. From further investigation, Joel finds out that Clementine has embarked on a radical procedure that has resulted in her wiping all existence of Joel from her mind. As a reaction to this, Joel undergoes the same operation to do the same thing. From here on in, the film follows Joel's memories and he begins, though his unconscious mind, to remember why he loves Clementine.As the film is mainly set in the mind, the visuals and settings are vividly bought to life from recurring images and motifs. There are numerous humour filled moments using forced perspectives. Many of Gondry's visual tricks of repetition and surrealism come into play.For those of you expecting your usual Jim Carrey vehicle, you'll be very disappointed. None of his facial pulls or goofy antics are on show and his performance is akin to his other serious acting performances (The Truman Show, The Majestic and to some lesser extent, The Man on the Moon). As for Kate Winslet, she is always capable of pulling off a convincing performance as a kooky, hippy and impulsive woman.An original and invigorating story about a two people who fall out of love but fate and realization brings them back together. A unique insight into a couples love life. Through the highs and lows of the memories in Joel's mind, he comes to find that it's the faults and differences that make him attracted to Clementine. Watch with an open and clear mind and fall in love with a romantic comedy with a difference.",9,0,1,8 September 2012
The Artist," A Silent Treat
","The Artist has garnered a lot of rave reviews based on it's simplicity and charming tale. The story revolves around a successful silent movie star George Valentin (played with such delightfulness and glee by Jean Dujardin) who struggles to adapt to the advent of talking pictures. For those of you who don't know, this film is in black and white and is a (mainly) silent feature.The film opens up in a movie theatre which is playing Valentin's latest hit film. When the film finishes, Valentin and his co-star come onto stage to accept their applauds and from this point onwards you'll understand the tone and mechanics of the plot. As Valentin laps up the cheers, through exaggerated physical and comedic movement, you understand what is clearly going on. It's never at all difficult to follow the action on screen. When he leaves the auditorium a chance encounter with a young girl changes both their lives. The young girl Peppy Miller (an aspiring actress) causes a bit of commotion and catches the eye of our silent film star.With the chance encounter comes the coincidental casting of Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) as an extra in Valentin's next feature film, sparks fly as chemistry forms between the two. As their individual careers take off, the advent of talking movies come of age but with only one of them embracing the new technology, the other is left behind and becomes last weeks news.What you probably notice straightaway is that it's immensely easy to follow. With the lack of dialogue (only the occasional title cards pop up) the acting is at the highest calibre as every emotion, feeling and thought is conveyed with effortless beguile and subtly. A mention should go to the dog as the animal plays an important part in the film and adds certain extra magic to the whole proceedings. It feels light with many nice comic touches (many come from the performance by the four legged friend) and even if the film has a predictable arc, it's still very watchableA film shot in 1:33 ratio with a simplistic direction (which does not mean poor!) it revels in it's influences which made cinema what it was all those years ago. Simple track and pan, close ups and minimal edits which allows for a masterclass in acting by both leads. There's no room here for flash in the pan jerky camera movements and fast cut edits (which has hampered modern film efforts of late), the camera simply focuses on the actors faces and we as the audience are asked to interpret the emotion and feelings. It's the uncomplicated, plain and simple narrative which is accompanied by it's charm and witty rapport.It's a joy to behold and a far cry from majority of today's modern blockbusters, where all the skill and craftsmanship from yesteryear's grace our screens. The era is capture with an eye for detail as costumes, dance moves and mannerisms reflect the period so well (just wait until you see Peppy's audition as an extra!). It's a great tribute to cinema and celebrates a time and era where entertainment was the main aim and this picture undoubtedly engrosses, enthrals and of course entertains.",10,0,1,28 January 2012
The Conjuring," Another impressive horror from director James Wan
","I finally got round to watching The Conjuring the other day and my word, was it impressive. It reminded me a lot of the old horror films I use to watch when I was younger. A lot of jump scares and quiet then loud moments but the overall the film succeeds because of it's use of older and simpler techniques. I think a lot of modern audiences have forgotten how to feel scared.The story is based on a true story(!) about a family moving into a new home where strange occurrences start to befall the family members. They contact a paranormal team wife and husband Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) to investigate. What the couple encounter is something more deadlier than they could ever imagined. With all types of movies based on true stories, as an audience member you can either believe everything you see as fact or take it with a pinch of salt. If you take the former belief then the movie may take on more meaning and shocks and scares may make you feel more....well uneasy. Though saying that if you are a non believable, the story can still provide you with feeling of unease and creepiness.What works well in this entertaining yarn is it's ability to surprise you with jumps and scares that you think are coming then don't and when they do, it's executed very well. As a fan of the genre I found myself jumping at few choice moments (even though I could tell they something was about to happen). Some of the scares come from implied/suggestive moments like in one scene where two of the daughters are woken up by something and one of the daughters believe that that thing is behind the door, and as an audience member you imagination runs wild as you wait for something to come out only for the door to slam shut and for your heart to miss a beat. It's a cheap trick but very effective. There is little to no gore in this film so gore hounds will be very disappointed. The acting is uniformly strong in this film with everyone playing their parts straight and with conviction. The director has done his homework too and uses old tricks from classic horror films which he implements with a assurance and aplomb. For those of you who haven't seen old school horror films, this will be a great introduction, and for those of you who have, you can fondly remember how we all use to be scared at the things that go bump in the night and the darkness that lie in the corners of every room.",9,0,2,5 September 2013
Prometheus," Unsatisfying and unanswered questions only saved by settings and directions.
","When I go to the cinema I sometimes find it really hard to switch off and just enjoy a film. I'm finding more and more that when I go to watch something, I put my critical head on and think about finding negatives and positives. Alas I did the same with this film. For those of you not in the know, Prometheus is set in the same world as the 'Alien' films, a semi-prequel. A couple of explorers found clues to the origins of mankind and embark on a quest to find 'answers' as to who and why we were created. The company funding the trip is Weyland (the same company who feature in the Alien universe) and a select group of scientists and company employees go in search and find the meaning of life. Much is expected from this film and I for one, am one of those who could not wait to see it. As a big fan of the Alien films, I had high expectations, but when it came out and there were whispers of it not being anything more than a big sci fi film which happens to co exists in the same world as the great films that preceded it, I was apprehensive. It wasn't an alien film....but in it's defence, Ridley Scott has always claimed that this is a standalone film which echoes from the Alien universe. The main problem I had with it is the fact I feel the film uses it's links to the classic films to garner audiences to go and see it. I don't think the film would have had a big budget or the director if it was just another science fiction film. Is the film any good though? Well, it's not bad but it's not great. It is lacking in thrills and suspense but has some interesting ideas. I enjoyed it but I had many reservations with character's and some few plot points/holes. The film's characters are sketchily drawn, only a few are given more depth and personality while others just stand and look on in awe. With Noomi Rapace's character (Elisabeth Shaw) she is feisty and a survivor and the main protagonist so comparison will undoubtedly be made to Ripley. The only other character to have any depth would be the android David played with cool calmness by Michael Fassbender. Unfortunately the others are all forgettable and lack any real emotional connection.A personal frustration I encountered with this film is that throughout numerous questions are raised but most are left unanswered. There is little or no clear resolution. The ambiguity throughout allows for viewers to interpreter their own answers and reasons to why things happen, which some may like but does little for me. It clearly has the stamp of 'Lost' (writer and co-creator Damon Lindelof is on script duties) all over the narrative. The motives of the engineers (the space jockey from Alien) are never clear, and neither is David. It leads to an unsatisfying feeling.On the positive note, the location and cinematography is superb (but I never expected it not to be). The attention to detail on the ship is magnificent and the mood and lighting effects are in keeping with the Alien universe. There is clearly a deliberate attempt at making the film echo it's predecessors in tone as well as in it's dialogue, and that gives the film a sense of the familiar and allows the audience to feel comfortable in it's setting. One feels that this film would not of had the excitement or expectations if the film was not set in the same universe, but then it's kind of hard to see this working without it. Many of you would no doubt do the same and make comparison to the other films, but it's unfair to do so and to watch it without thinking of the other films is really hard. In fact all this films does is make me want to watch Alien again.",7,1,4,13 June 2012
Before Sunrise," a romantic film for romantic idealists
","Linklater's simple yet highly enjoyable film where the two main performers are the key to the films success. Before Sunrise is another one of Richard Linklater's experimental films where the dialogue and performances are the main focus and the usual filmic techniques (like multiple edits, shots and angles) are abandoned for a more free form and relaxing capture of what genuinely feels like a blossoming relationship.Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are two strangers who meet on a eurorail heading towards Vienna. An argument between a German couple provides the excuse/reason for Celine (Delpy) to sit adjacent to Jesse (Hawke). Jesse takes this opportunity to talk to Celine. They sit together and start a conversation where the spark of a budding relationship begins to form. When the train finally stops at Vienna, Jesse plans to get off whereas Celine is suppose to be heading on. Jesse decides to take a chance and invites Celine to spend a day in Vienna with him as he has no money for a hotel/accommodation. They both feel like they could talk for hours and didn't want the conversation to stop so Celine gets off on the same stop and we follow them, getting to know one another on the streets of Vienna.For those of you expecting anything dramatic in terms of action or dialogue you are watching the wrong film. It's just goes on from one conversation to another. It's set at a very leisurely pace as the two of them walk the streets of Vienna where they discuss things that come to mind. One scene has them being tracked through the streets in one continual shot which is marvellous done as both leads talk so naturally it feels like we are listening in on a private conversation, though what they talk about is not at all pompous or overly intellectual but of amusing observations, anecdotes and quirky ideas (like reincarnation and monkeys!)There is one particular scene in the music store where they stand in a booth and listen to some music, quickly glancing at one another hoping for the other not to catch them looking. It's all too cute, touching and refreshingly genuine. A romantic tale where a boy meets girl and actually talk to one another from past experience, ideals and opinions on everything no matter how insignificant, or obscure. It's these little things that gives this film it's beauty and enjoyment. As their relationship unfolds it becomes more and more naturalistic and believable. Can two strangers meet and fall in love in one night? For those of you who hold some romantic notion/ideal then the answer would be yes, but for those cynics out there, you will probably think this is all too convenient.Not a film which will be suited for those looking for something more than just two people discovering each others personality and a film where dialogue is the main driving force of the plot. The two leads are extremely likable and very easy on the eyes, with a completely believable and very genuine look at two people falling for one another and with the film finishing with both characters promising to come back and reconnect, the film is left for us to imagine whether their love can truly blossom such is the way of the spirit of the film, very invigorating, imaginative and joyful to watch.",9,1,2,15 August 2011
Amélie," Fabulous French Fairytale!
","Could there been a better time to review a classic than it's ten year anniversary? Released only a decade ago Amelie has firmly established itself as a timeless classic. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's best film so far (his latter films are a bit of a disappointment but check out his earlier works 'Delicatessen' and 'The City Of Lost Children'), here he is allowed full rein over his expressionistic ideas and visions, brought to live by a simplistic and charming story of a young girl with an imaginative and inventive mind growing up with little or no friends where all she has for company is her fantastical views on people and her unique look on life.The story starts with a narrator regaling little facts about bluebottle flies before moving onto the main character and her family. Divulging further tit-bits in an entertaining and statistical manner over her families likes, dislikes and idiosyncrasy (not just about Amelie but every character the camera comes across, we get a little story on obsessive compulsive behaviours ranging from bubble wrap popping to bone cracking). As we follow Amelie on her fabulous journey (the English literal translation is The Fabulous Life of Amelie Poulain!) one event which affects our heroine is the death of Lady Diana. With the news playing in the background Amelie drops a lid, that rolls towards a tile, which happens to be loose and it's there she finds someones hidden childhood memories. That night she decides to track down it's owner, return it to him and if they are grateful she'll continue to do further good deeds. From there on the film goes off on an extraordinary and incredible adventure where she becomes a match maker, a tour guide, a deceased lover and a woman looking for love amongst others.It's a film that is so beautifully shot with outstanding colourisation and a marvellous use of warm soft Earthy tones of greens, reds and yellows. Paris has never looked so autumnal. The complementary colours of the greens and reds brings out the vibrancy and warmth which gives the film more heart and feeling. It's a quality the film never veers away from and as a failed artist it's not too hard to spot the beauty and artistry of the cinematography. Along with the beautiful music by Yann Tiersen, they combine to add an elegance and haunting beauty to what is already a feast for the eyes let alone the ears.The breakout performance from Audrey Tautou as Amelie who in nature appears child like and innocence enables her to tug on viewers heartstrings at all the right places. A spot-on capture of someone who is positive and has their heart in the right place though has a sly wicked streak for those who deserve punishment (a comical moment in the film where she teaches a market vendor a lesson or two in humbleness and humility). With a uniformly strong supporting cast (keep your eyes out for Jeunets regulars Dominique Pinon and Rufus) the story ticks along with each characters little foibles creating a world where perfection is not the norm and everyone has their own little obsessive behaviours whether they know it or not. Cynics of you may not buy into its charms or understand Amelie's take on the world and life. The mixture of fantasy, dreams and reality may not be everyone's taste but it's undeniably wonderful and captures the human spirit and it's faults to a tee. It's an escape from reality and that is what cinema is all about. You don't go to see the mundane and the drab (though in this film even the mundane and the drab are given beauty and purpose). Here, the joys and euphoria come at you in equal measure and one persons act of kindness is surely something that's not too hard to imagine.This is dedicated to my wife, my very own Amelie as this is one of her favourite films, and like Amelie she has a heart of gold and would do anything and everything for anyone.",10,2,5,19 October 2011
Looper," Twist your brain round this
","Set in the mid 21st century, Looper are a group of hit men who kill victims who are sent back from the future. Hired by mobs from the future, the Loopers are run by Abe (Jeff Daniels) who is sent back to look after things in the present (past?). One of these loopers is Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who learns that one by one, all the loopers are being sent back to be killed off. Loops are being closed off and if they fail to kill their future selves then a hit is order to kill either the present Looper or the future Looper.As Joe fails to kill his future self (Bruce Willis), his future self tries to change the course of time and the future, while the younger Joe just wants to live out his life and will do so even if it means killing his future self. The plot opens up to show how and why the future Joe wants to eradicate the mysterious crime boss The Rainmaker. He believes that killing him while he is young will allow him to live the life he has lived....you following? What the film does is give you two protagonist and you are never quite sure who to root for. Is it the older self who has learnt from his mistakes or is it the young Joe who is yet to learn from it. As the story unfolds the young Joe comes across one of the three possible targets that could be the potential young Rainmaker and sets out to protect him and his mother (Emily Blunt) from the older Joe. One has knowledge of the future and his own life whilst the other is living in the present doing what he believes to be right. It's a conflict which continues for both Joes' to struggle with as well as for the viewer.A film that does well in creating an emotional response, the main characters provide an interesting emotional arch and has more depth to them than you would normally expect from these types of films. Emily Blunt character and her son gives the film it's change in pace. It starts up fast and frenetic and slows to a more meditative and reflect tone as characters become aware of their destiny and how some things are impossible to change.A sci-fi film with plenty of intelligence, it never relies heavily on special effects or set pieces to provide entertainment. It feels very usual to see how little action is on show and more on the character development side of things. It does borrow from plots of other great sci-fi like the Terminator but it isn't as straight forward as that. It's like having the choice in going back to kill Hitler as a child knowing what he would do but having the strength to kill an innocent young human being with little or no evil in them yet.A complex and interesting film brimming with ideas, with a standout performance from new comer Pierce Gagnon as the potential future crime lord. A kid so young not being out done by established actors on screen. Most may find the make up on young Joe a little distracting but nevertheless it is a passable resemblances to Bruce Willis.A thoroughly entertaining film with a strong and complex narrative which will lead you to think about it for days on end as you try to work out it's convoluted plot.",9,0,3,2 February 2013
Moon," Moon
","It is hard to write a review without giving away too much as to not spoil your surprise or enjoyment, but just watch the trailer and you will get the basic premise of the film but luckily it doesn't show you everything that will ruin the overall pleasure.The film starts us off with stock footage telling us that the Earths natural resources are pretty much used up and more environmentally friendly sources of energy can be found on the moon. This is where majority of the film takes place.Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), is nearing his 3 year stint on the moon with only Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) as his reliable and only companion, he is most certainly looking forward to going home, but not everything goes according to plan. After 3 years of isolation and no contact with the outside world (he only receives delayed video transmission from Earth via satellite link) he begins to see things (an unknown woman on the base) and notices minor glitches in video playback and archive footage of himself he doesn't remember recording. When one of the mining vehicles stalls, Sam goes out to investigate only to find his hallucination reappearing on the surface of the moon which causes him to crash.When he wakes up in the infirmary, he has no recollection of the crash. This is when the real mystery and marvel of the film begins The recovered Sam notices that the mining vehicle is still not in proper working order but Gerty denies him access to go outside. When Sam manages to convince Gerty to let him check it out, he comes across an abandoned lunar vehicle next to one of the mining vehicle and finds an unconscious body. 'His' unconscious body....This film is outstanding and the performance by Sam Rockwell is superb (he was criminally denied a nod for best actor). The main driving force in the film, is that Sam is able to portray himself as two different characters and the amount of sadness and loneliness he displays when he is alone is a complete contrast to the anger, frustration and confusion that he shows as the 2nd Sam Bell. The supporting vocals from Kevin Spacey also provides the film more of the feeling of isolation and alienation. Its all done very monotonous way but he does convey human emotions via emoticon.Little touches within the film are marvellous and subtle. The use of Chesney Hawkes 'The One and Only' is so ironic and apt used that it is the probably only time I would ever tolerate his music. The score as well is very haunting and very effective. Clint Mansell (Requiem For a Dream) once again creates the perfect ambient and mood.We see the influences worn clearly on its sleeve. The sets and designs are very in keeping with other sci-fi classic. White minimalistic interiors (2001, Alien) and a computer called Gerty who is very HAL-like (also 2001) and vast emptiness of space. It's very much a throwback to old 70s and early 80s sci-fi films. Scenes are reminiscent of films like Silent Running and Outlands. Films like these are not always about alien invasions and this is one that questions, why are we here and who are we really....The general themes on what makes us humans and what is humanity are very apparent and asks you questions on what really makes us who we are. Is it our ability to dream, think, desire and to feel... The portrayal of these human qualities by Sam Rockwell gives the film its heart and soul. We are all rooting for him to make it home because of the suffering and desire to see 'his' loved ones is so overwhelming. We start off with a man waiting to go home only for it to turn out to be a film about identity.It is an intelligent and very thoughtful piece of science fiction with a deeply affecting performance from Sam Rockwell. With no other major actor (bar Kevin Spaceys voice and video footage via satellite) it is a wonderful and mesmerising display of skill and nuances from Sam Rockwell that even if you don't enjoy sci-fi movies you have to tip your hat in acknowledgement of his 'one' man show.if you like my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com/",10,3,8,10 February 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Not as good as the first but better than the second
","The third film in the successful franchise based on an 80s toy product. This one sees the plot revolving around Earth's manned mission to the moon in the 60s (which incorporates some good use of archive footage). The real reason behind the mission is in fact a cover up for an 'incident' which the world was in the dark over. An Autobot spaceship which crash landed on the surface on the moon, millions of years ago.With the intriguing premise, the film unfortunately starts to flag. As we head back to the drama's of Sam (Shia Labeouf) Witwicky life. Set a couple of years of the 2nd film. Sam is struggling to find a job whilst his Autobot companions are out on secret missions maintain peace and order with their human allies. It isn't too long before the Decepticons make an appearance and are back to their old tricks again. We learn that within the crashed spaceship (the Ark) contains special pillars that could help the Autobots once and for all to conquer the Decepticons and win the war....but in the wrong hands they could also lead to the destruction of the planet Earth.To summarise the plot in such way makes the film so interesting and exciting but it is far from it. The total lack of serious/normal characters in the film jars the brooding menace. Every supporting character is a bit weird (John Malkovich's- Bruce Bezo) or over hyperactive (Ken Jeong's-Jerry Wang). It sometimes feels like there are two films competing here. One a wacky and (un)funny comedy drama whilst the other, an explosive and eye popping special effects laden action film. I am at a loss as to why there was any need for such a need to try to use stock footage of real events for it to only throw us such infantile humour. After the absolute slating that the 2nd film received you would have thought that Bay would have learnt his lesson, but far from it. Racial stereotypes are still ever present and it seems like any ethnic minority is portray in very unpolitical correct way. A Scottish sounding Autobot is heard to say 'I'll bottle ya' The humour is also not at all funny. If you do laugh, you'd be laughing at the absolute dire dialogue written for the film. I had high hopes for this film and my hopes soon turned to anger and dismay.The other problem with the film is the pacing of the whole thing. It takes an absolute age for anything exciting to happen. When you come to see a film like this you'd expect robots to be smashing other robots, buildings or any other inanimate object. What you get is a limp attempt at humour and character development. Enough about the negatives you say, what about the positives? Well the action scenes are extremely well handled. If you watch in 3D then your eyes will be in for a treat. Bays trademark of slo-mo is in full effect and there is so much happening at one time you could get lost in which Transformer is which. With the carnage and mayhem, you're going to be in safe hands with Bay. The 3D is also implement in such dazzling array and the action packed set pieces are done with aplomb.I just wish he would try to leave school boy humour and offence pokes at other races alone. Apart from that I just about found the film tolerable. A complete mess with a tone which shifts from one extreme to another and just doesn't sit well. I now know why Megan Fox jumped ship and left this awful mess of a film. A sad waste of money, time and effort. I want my money back.",6,1,5,1 July 2011
