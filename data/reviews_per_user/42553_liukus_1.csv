The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Beautiful, fantastic
","This movie needs a special way of feelings, which is not given to everybody. It's a movie about choices in life. It can not be taken only as a real story. It has many levels, which should be found to understand the whole story. You can find perfect composition of pictures and sounds in this music. It would be worthy to see it only for music, but there is much more. Have a good time watching it.p.s. It's not an american style movie...",10,18,37,6 July 2003
