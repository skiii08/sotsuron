Logue always supports King George V, including treatment of the king's difficulty.I am attracted to the part when King George V finds out that he actually is able to speak a lot. I respect Logue because he knows how to let the king speak. Moreover, the actor of King George V, Colin Firth, makes the story more interesting and great. It must have been hard to act as if he has difficulty in speaking. How his expressions move and what he says make the viewers feel closer to the main character.The main message of this movie, in my opinion, is that trying hard and not giving up for something can make your goal come true. Also, friends or supporters around you are more important than you actually think.

","This is a SF story about aliens who comes to the earth; it is mainly about one alien and one human boy. He is left on the earth when other aliens go back to their planet.The most attracting point of the story I thought is the strong bond between E.T., the alien, and the boy, Elliot, and his brother and sister.

","This is a story about one guy, Tom, falling in love with one girl whose name is Summer. He approaches Summer and becomes love her more and more. He believes in destinies. On the other hand, Summer does not believe in destinies. This difference in concepts of love between Tom and Summer makes them being in a trouble.The most impressing point of this movie is how opinions of people differ from each other's. It is kind of funny even though it is an ordinary fact. I have felt very sorry when Tom sings fiercely at karaoke after Summer has said something negative to Tom. I actually do not understand how Summer thinks. In my opinion, the way Tom thinks is a usual one which is same as mine. I also have felt mixed with the fact that Tom cannot express and explain his real thought to Summer and Summer does not realize his thought, too.The main message of this movie, in my opinion, is that every person has different idea. This fact should be an obvious one, but many people forget about it. Sometimes you have a problem with someone because of gaps of your thinking, which cannot be ignored.In conclusion, this is a story of a man who loves one lady. It tells the viewers to acknowledge differences in opinions between people.",10,0,0,21 December 2015
