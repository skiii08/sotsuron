Ford v Ferrari," A fresh idea out of Holloywood
","I've been down on Hollywood lately. In that regard this film was refreshing.
This film puts an interesting perspective on LeMans, and how the US got there with the GT40.
I grew up in the 60's. I was 15 when this race occurred. Carroll Shelby was a God and the GT40 a dream.
It was a time when things could get done in this country. JFK said we're going to the moon.....we did. Carroll Shelby wanted to eat Corvettes on the track and he did with the Cobra. Henry Ford II wanted to beat Ferrari and with Shelby and Miles and the GT40 he did. Pull out the stops, damn the corporate committees, just a 'git 'er done' mentality.
It's a fun film that doesn't get lost in the racing. It is a story of friendship, attitude, determination and yes, Le Mans.
It is also a fantastic ode to some the greatest icons of Automotive history, Shelby, Miles, Iacocca, Henry Ford II.
Go, watch and enjoy,",9,3,6,20 November 2019
Jersey Boys," An Excellent homage to the 4 Four Seasons
","I'll say it right off, if you're looking for the energy of the Stage show you will not find here. The closest they came was the Cast Call at the end, it may very well have been the best part of the movie.That considered, it is otherwise a totally enjoyable movie. The cast was excellent, as were the direction and editing. The period was captured well' It is a period piece about an iconic vocal group of the 60's-70's. Taken as such it was done well and presented a top vocal group in a rapidly evolving era in music. A group that evolved in a different direction from the prevalent psychedelic direction of the time.I didn't think we would see much of a crowd there and I was correct, and those who were there lived through the period. This was not a young crowd and I doubt there will much interest from the younger age groups.",7,5,18,24 June 2014
Kong: Skull Island," Why?
","I believe this is the 4th iteration of King Kong and none of the remakes hold candle to the original, this one is no exception.It is rare for a remake to improve on a classic, when will these writers, producers, and directors learn.And as if the story isn't bad enough, they have to compound the problem with their environmental and social justice commentary.Find something else to watch, like maybe the original.",2,1,2,26 November 2017
