Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," starwars episode 1 an ok movie
",I feel that this film while not being as good as the previous films it was a great film . The sfx was excellent and the final battle was spectacular and the acting was very good . so over all this was an o.k film,7,0,1,1 July 2002
Batman Returns," Good, But not quite Batman.
","Batman Returns is a very good movie in its own right. Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito are excellent though slightly let down by (sigh) Christopher Walken. If this movie has a weakness, its that the main characters (especially 'Penguin') are very grose. This movie, while not being quite as good, does credit to 'BATMAN' and is a fun movie to watch.WARNING: If you play Batman Returns on a projection T.V, you may have problems seeing it because it is filmed in low light!!!",Null,0,0,27 July 2002
Ed Wood," Essential Viewing  Masterpiece!
","Ed Wood is one of the best films that I have seen. The discreet mix of comedy and sincerity works at so many levels! The acting performances are superb from Martin Landau, Johnny Depp and Bill Murray, though the performances from the supporting cast are impeccable. Tim Burton escapes from his Super-Weird style of directing and leaves the audience wowed by his thorough story telling and nice camera set-ups. Maybe the finest art of this movie is the music, mimicking the 1950's UFO movie scores whilst making the movie comfortable to watch at the same time. The nice thing about Burton's directing is that whilst you can see that Edward .D. Wood Jr. had little to no directing or writing talents, he was someone who enjoyed making films an telling stories. Bela Lugosi isn't a very likeable character in the film. His frequent mood swings are funny, but not nearly as funny as Bill Murray, who plays the unsatisfied transvestite whom wishes to say goodbye to his genitalia. By all accounts, this movie is historically accurate, and anyone who has been unfortunate enough to see Plan 9 From Outer Space' and is interested in its making (even if you're not, you will be after seeing the movie!) you NEED to see this film. Contains Frequent Swearing, Mild Sexual References and Frequent Drug Abuse.",Null,0,0,27 April 2003
The Day After Tomorrow," Particularly poor `Blockbuster' effort.
","D: Roland Emerich. Dennis Quaid; Jake Gyllenhaul; Ian Holm. I wanted to like this film, I really did, but to be honest, it is just a sly, pessimistic disaster film with more CGI than sense. Scientist/Meteorologist Quaid makes a shocking discovery which leads him to believe that a new ice age dawns. Typical English professor Holm agrees with him, but no-one with any authority does. This ridiculous story begs many questions: If such a huge fluctuation in the climate were to take place, and all the evidence was there to back up the theory, wouldn't more scientists realise it? Why is the vice president left to make all the important decisions?  What is director Roland Emerich's obsession with destroying New York City? If Quaid is a government scientist, why is he not allowed to use the facilities or talk to the people in charge? Why does the film have to deal with Quaid's wife as a doctor treating terminally ill children; a horribly manipulative afterthought to the story which, instead of bringing it down to earth, gives it a sickly feeling? Many of the questions have no answer except from this: The film is garbage. What really makes this film particularly unconvincing is that it completely relies on CGI technology which is simply not good enough. And also that is basically just a remake of Emerich's earlier `Godzilla' travesty minus the Lizard. However, on the plus side, Dennis Quaid isn't bad as the scientist and Jake Gyllenhaul shows talent as his son  but Ian Holm's performance as the professor is a bigger disaster for his career than the film itself. He genuinely looks embarrassed to be appearing in this picture. So, in conclusion, this film is a real waste of time. Let's all hope that Emerich makes a better movie next time (considering he hasn't made a good one yet, don't get your hopes up) or else stops making them all together. This is two hours of your life you won't get back.",Null,0,1,20 August 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A Fantastic Movie
","Richard Marquand does an excellent job on this fantastic movie. The Star Wars trilogy is topped by this, which is possibly the best in the series. Any respectful Star Wars fan should own this on video, or turning the key in their car to drive down to the video shop to buy it. Richard Marquands short career left him with at least one highly recognised and brilliant film. Mark Hammil, Harrisson Ford and Carrie Fisher provide steady performances whilst Ian McDiarmid and David Prowse provide an incredible sense of fear to the film. Star Wars is arguabley the best saga of films we will ever see, and we should be glad that quality films like this exist.",10,0,1,19 June 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The director has let us down.
","When I obtained pre booked tickets for the long awaited 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone (Philosiphers Stone) I was very pleased with myself and went into the packed cinema to get a good seat. When the film started however, I noticed the massive chunks of the book just dissapearing in the wave of a wand. Director Chris Colombus is not too good at this type of film and lets us down with his nasty angles and overuse of zoom. The child acting is terrible at best, though Rupert Grint plays a satisfactory part as Ron Weasley, Harry's mate. Steve Kloves has completely destroyed a fantastic book with this screenplay, though, if you ignore the amazing book, you may enjoy this film.",5,0,1,21 June 2002
Sin City," Not without its faults, but generally a solid piece of Modern Cinema
","A tempting collaboration between comic author Frank Miller, movie whiz kid Robert Rodruiguez and everyone's favorite eccentric Quentin Tarantino binds CGI and good live performances well. Produced in much the same way as Rodruiguez's other recent efforts, the filming was confined to a Green Screen sound stage and the backgrounds added in post production. This process seems to get better with every film, though I would not say that any of these cyber-movies have surpassed 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' in their mixing of CGI and actors.Sin City is a movie aimed at adults, but only specific audiences. Fans of either the comic series or gritty crime dramas will enjoy the film, but all others may walk away disappointed. The Bruce Willis/Michael Madsen segments of the film are typically Tarantino - the first portion of this segment is easily the best. The picture is divided into mini-movies, each with their own casts led by a name actor. The best of these is easily the Clive Owen segment, in which he helps a group of inner-city hookers defend themselves against thugs. Owen's good acting overcomes his slightly unconvincing American acting, and the segment passes through nicely.The film has its flaws, the Mickey Rourke segment for instance is at best tedious. Rourke seems suited to the roll, but the secondary characters and the plot of the segment don't really 'work'. Some of the plot points are boring and unnecessary and some of the sequences are so dark that they are simply not enjoyable. Small roles by Josh Hartnett and Michael Clarke Duncan add nothing to the film, Hartnett's part is especially silly and was obviously shot over one day or so.The best performance of the film comes from Bruce Willis, who is totally convincing as an aging cop. The on screen relationship between Willis and Jessica Alba are excellent, evidently displaying acting talent from the young actress and a return to form for Willis. Mickey Rourke is fine as Marv, perhaps only Rourke can play such a disgusting character who, despite being the hero, is revolted by the viewer. Elijah Wood does what it says on the tin as a demented serial killer, but the segment he appears in is far to vague. The random introductions of characters does not help and the story plod along.Overall, Sin City is a solid movie, ideal viewing for fans of the genre. But one thing constantly annoyed me whilst watching the film; I got so bored with gun shots and punches to the jaw that I was about ready to administer one on myself! I feel their was a slight overuse of weapons in the film - but I suppose that would be expected. This is possibly the closest Comic Book conversion in movie history, and fans of the originals will obviously love this. Be careful, you will either love this film or be disappointed by it. I myself loved it, but pointed out the flaws for the purpose of reviewing it.My rating is 7/10 - See it but be warned!",7,0,1,29 May 2005
