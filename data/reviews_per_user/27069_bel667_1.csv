Spartacus," Just a 'little' commentary
","I would not write an entire critic for this movie, because it's clearly out of my range. As a summary I'll say its the film that most perfectly portraits the concept of freedom.I will only write a commentary about the final scene. I remember how I liked the whole film when I first saw it a lot of years ago. But with every time I saw it afterwards, I began to realize the level of perfection the final scene achieves.Today, every time I see the film, I cry at the end. It's the most wonderful ending any script of any film has achieved, IMHO. In fact, itÂ´s the happiest end that would have been realistic without being historically wrong.",Null,3,5,29 August 2002
