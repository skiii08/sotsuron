Saturday Night Fever," MY favorite musical movie!!!
","Saturday Night Fever marked the beginning of a new generation,a young dreamer called Tony Manero (John Travolta)is the king of the NYC discos at the 70s,works for some coins in a store by day,but when is the night, especially the weekends,he turns in the greatest dancer of the 'big apple',along with his nasty friends,lives in a world of lust and pleasure. Being an Italian descendant,into a mid-class family,his room shows the posters of 2 icons for then:Bruce Lee,deceased 4 years ago and 'Rocky' or better to say Sylvester Stallone already all an idol,his parents so funny and bizarre,a brother the pride of the family owing to his devotion to the faith:a priest,but he will be carried by Tony into the disco world,How can we forget that music full of energy?Regretly many youngsters despises that great rhythm,intolerance and absurd slim less noises crowd those heads,it's so funny to watch a young Fran Drescher(the gorgeous 'Nanny')STANDING WITH HER PRETTY AND SEXY GREEN CHANNEL DRESS awaiting for Tony Manero taking over the lighten ballroom with 'YOU SHOULD BE DANCING' by the Bee Gees,THE PLOT IS NOT EXTRAORDINARY,but for those years children,young boys,adults and even elder people enjoyed this flick. But the final was sad after one of his frolic friends dies,everything crumbled down,and even Tony felt the emptiness of his rushed life, his occasional partner Stephenie went away from him,because he tried to make non-desired love and she refuses all the Tony's behavior. It's unforgettable the moment when they waved goodbye,'How deep is your love' by 'The Bee Gees' penetrated all the inner being of us, it was not a happy end,you can dislike so many things about this movie,regrettably the Disco is underrated,many teens prefer to burst their minds with ugly screams,rhythm-less noises claiming hate,anger and violence for free,please learn to respect,understand what you cant analyze,this film and its soundtrack will be eternal!!!",7,0,1,8 August 2006
Citizen Kane," Welles the giant citizen!!!
","The main trouble to face for a new viewers is to watch old movies in an uncomfortable black and white vision,but not always full-colors mean quality although it's more easy to get funny and amusement about it.Coming over those circumstances this huge movie is THE REAL SHOW OF THE LIFE,an almost 'biopic' based in the life of the famous media mogul William Randolph Hearst(father of the former subversive Patty Hearst,a muriatic figure for today),it's displayed the power of the mass media,how many influence can be obtained manipulating the mass media,the absolute emptiness of 'winning all' when the peak is not the real reason to get the happiness. Welles,What can i say about this inmortal?:nothing, because between the everything that he meant and useless words not enough to describe this never to compare talent,let's believe only one thing:after all it's said everything.",9,0,4,5 August 2006
Batman Returns," The best of the 5 movies!
","I make my comment when i just have seen all the Batman movies including the awful as overrated 'Batman Begins',in this sequel Bruce Wayne(Michael Keaton,a good performer but a bad Batman)falls in love with a crazed and fired employed called Selina Kyle(a good Michelle Pfeiffer)but after she lost her job, turned in the 'Catwoman'(sand for the kitties saved her life when her former boss threw her trough a window),meanwhile a fatso freaky living in the cloaks of Gotham self-called Pinguin(Danny De Vito)challenges the caped one invading the city with his feathered 'friends',in the final struggles Batman defeats Pinguin but his relation with Catwoman is pending between love and hate,the eternal trouble present in the comics of this character, Burton developed it in an efficient way.The performers were good though to see Pfeiffer as villain made me hesitate,she did it so good,yet rather i preferred Sharon Stone(she didn't accept because 'Basic Instincts' was made almost in a same moment)but Michelle is a superior actress and did her best as the tiny DeVito,two scenes were superb:when the Ice Princess is tied up and Catwoman fights Batman amidst of the roof,and when Batman unmasks himself in the end,Keaton doesn't look at all to the comic character, but this moment showed his value,regrettably his look is not to be Batman,nevertheless this flick never bored like the first one did make it for many viewers in spite his fans,Burton got better this time.",7,1,3,25 December 2006
American History X," American Histery?
","A raged 'skinhead' Derek Vinyard(an excellent Edward Norton)kills 2 black boys when they robbed his car,before the eyes of his family Derek is busted,but in the collective memory Danny(Furlong)his less brother remains with a feeling of admiration,following the wrong steps of his convicted brother,after 3 years of jail and getting his parole, Derek decides to change the damned course of his wicked way of life, a smart teacher Bob Sweeney(Avery Brooks)is the good light to their raged lives,in the opposite side Cameron(Stacy Keach)leads the punk haters against the NON-WASP,but a redemptive Derek faces this crazed guy to set free his brother,when Derek tells the truth to Danny the dreadful hell where he was for 3 years,Danny decides to quit of those misfits,and composes to Sweeney his point of view about this stupid kind of racism,but when Derek just discovered the 'white' reason to adore garbage as Hitler,svasticas and more insanity,a black boy shot the brand newcomer Danny,turning around the world again in the end.Good movie indeed,but something has missed in some points:Gould as talented as brief,Keach was good,but when i saw the deleted scenes on my DVD,we see deleted scenes that show a more explicit action of his character and his fellas in hate,it could explain Derek's new attitude when he was raped,but i mean that scene was awful,i'm not so naive to ignore what happens at the jails,but when you see all the 'white' hypocrisy dealing drugs with those whom they say to despise it was enough to unmask those freaky guys and their sicking 'Mein Kampf' pride(Hitler hatred even all the American white men!therefore those crooks might have been slaughtered in first degree in case of that maniac genocide had gotten the victory,ironic though!)specially when that store was ransacked because his owner was a yellow man and his servants were illegal aliens.'The hate you take is equal to the hate you made' (changing some lyrics of 'The Beatles' to this occasion) Isn't it so?",7,0,1,21 December 2006
Resident Evil," So sexy Milla,one regular movie
","Since George Romero and his praised 'The night of the living Dead',we have seen so many movies in the 'zombie genre',even in a 'spaghettti way'(Italian versions),but this flick must be the most budgeted until now with some 'Star Wars' styled stages,the plot is similar to its predecessors:one lethal gas escaping from an advanced laboratory(common places before)and turning its workers in living dead,Alice(nice Milla Jovovich)after to betray her work,decides to lead and set free a few survivors from the disaster in a freaky way:kicking off in the air higher than Bruce Lee,mixing Lara Croft and 'Kill Bill' to combat zombies and mutant dogs in the same way as the known video game.Amusing film,the best:Milla her pretty body and that sexy gown,boots included,but all the line of the history is predictable,if you want 'fast-fun' watch it,no more to look for.",5,1,2,15 January 2007
Batman Begins," Clooney is equal to Bruce Wayne as Reeve Superman,Bale =BATEMAN
","I don't understand how this bundle of twilight is getting 8 of average, for those who want to reply me, don't offend,only show your ideas,OK? Respect to be respected!!! To begin, one Wayne goes to the TIBET like SERIES 60'S 'THE LEGEND OF THE CHAMPIONS' shook up with a '7 YEARS AT THE TIBET'!!!!,bad starting! now right here his master and guide is QUI-GON JINN!!!!! a Jedi master from the fatal'Episode 1',then Wayne is Obi WAN Kenobi'!!(but one moment please,shake'em with a little bit of Anakin,ALONE AND WITHOUT FAMILY),and Who is that yellow guy?:'Ra's Al'ghoul!',yes,the evil Muslim is for today Chinese(though WATANABE IS Japanese),but the good actor Neeson shall be RAGUL!!(pop name from comics),for those who don't know anything about Batman's comics JUST APPEARED AT JUNE OF '71,Kane created the hero at '39,Great contradiction,worse idea!,Neeson was superb at 'Schindler's List' and another films but here fell down, look the comics:Ragul looks like Christopher Lee not like Liam!!! Lee,despite his years, had done better job,Ragul has got a pretty daughter called TALIA,she didn't appeared here;and she really matters because loves Bat and props all the crimes of her father,Qui-GON Jinn passed to the Dark side!!!,Barbara 'Pennyworth' is a big shot compared with this insane proposal;and now a great miscasting:Caine huge actor as Alfred,but he looks like Gordon(only put him glasses and mustache),Gary OLDMAN SO TALENTED as a good Police chief??,he is a great specialist to create a fearsome crooks(when he was younger, could do a great new NORMAN BATES,not the Frakeinstein-like & out of quality called Vince Vaughn), to be good characters Oldman is wasted (dont remind 'Dr.Smith',that was poor exception)he could be the Scarecrow NOT MURPHY,Katie Holmes PRETTY but her glam was not exploited,her abduction was cheap(maybe they didn't tie her up to make a typical Batman's rescue),THE ONLY WOMAN in all this OVERRRATED,very valued but not to be deserved EXPERIMENT! About Cillian Murphy,Don't YOU care he looks like Tom Welling?,but more than he had done a good 'Scarecrow',Is a cheap two holed-purse a good mask to a high-budgeted film?,not even at the awful 60's Batman was possible,more absurd hard to match,and Katie defeated him,so easy with a single electroshock!!(torn horse included). KATIE Didn't KNOW CAPED'S NAME,but she discovered him at all,because heard a Wayne,s common phrase!!,Ragul did it too!! What a imagination!!,Morgan Freeman ran an unnecessary character,HAUER looked tired,YEARS ARE NOT IN VAIN,the first hour seemed 'Bateman Returns',CAPED JUST APPEARED AFTER WE GOT BORED 60 anti-insomnia minutes!!!,BURTON ONLY NEEDED 15',this Nolan's KINDRED is not better than 2,3,1(Kidman,Drew & Mazar at least put their glamor;Nicholson his wisdom to act and Pfeiffer,Danny their vein ),but here Nolan denies Kane'S CONCEPT,putting Ragul as Wayne's guiding light,when this foe was born 33 years ago from KANE'S first work;and not even to name Lazarus pit(SOURCE OF HIS STRENGTH& YOUTH). Nolan is a rookie director,he only had 4 films before this mourn chaos,this ghoul success product of a good merchandising,is the best evidence how Hollywood is lacking of ideas,but its good advertising overwhelms any logical. To complete the vicious CIRCLE:Ragul is good-intentioned but at his way!!(the real RAGUL HATES THE MANHOOD,his greed only wants power),'BATEMAN' Bale doesn't want to kill(Like West?,because Burton thought in otherwise),that bat mobile looked like a Hummel model 'Dessert STORM 2006',lower than the great design from 90's,the final raspberry to this bitter cake is to put Joker before BATMAN's approaching,WATCH the card held by OLDMAN at the end,therefore Jack Napier never fell to the chemical liquids because he was running out from Batman!! Bale almost asked Oldman:'PLEASE,INTRODUCE ME TO HIM',whacking Kane again Mr. Nolan,maybe their defenders will argue 'DARK KNIGHT' inspiration,BUT SO MUCH INSULT TO KANE IS INSANE. Don't you REALIZE Clooney is equal to the comics & cartoons' Bruce Wayne? it's a pity he acted bad at part 4,because Bale doesn't look like Wayne,maybe he defeats Keaton,Kilmer and West;but Clooney at every time you see him with careful you shall, see the same face as the bat-mogul as Chris Reeve looked like Superman,worse even,Nolan menaces us with a sequel at 2009,regretly without Clooney(hey,George,get out from those awful OCEAN'S and come back,maybe Warner FIRES Nolan and hires JAMES CAMERON,WITH A GOOD SCRIPT,YOU SHALL BE ACKKNOWLEDGED,PLEASE WE MISS YOU,ERR IS HUMAN,FORGIVE IS DIVINE)Bale is a good player but rather he replaces Craig(the new LAZENBY for sure!!)to perform James Bond,Nolan better you had to come into the Wayne's MANOR at the end!!Oh, my God:Nolan & Bryan Singer will increase all the comics' enemies around the world!!,BATMAN & SUPERMAN Don't DESERVE SUCH ATTEMPT!!!.",3,1,6,23 July 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Orange crush!
","Kubrick and all his talent in service to the frantic,a misfit called Alex Delarge(giant MacDowell!)leads a band of punks with the common sense in the life to make crimes with no feeling of guilty nor mercy, but this 'freaky' is busted by the policemen,and caged at the Ludovico Prison,the methods of re-adaptation were cruel and absurdest,cuffed in a chair,Alex is compelled to watch the greatest horrors in all the human history specially all the nazi genocide,this therapy seemed to scare Alex,but after his best,nothing can be changed from the bottom of his soul,it's sealed his doom. A clear criticism to the actual society,Kubrick uses the classical music in a shining way,showing humor,violence in an atypical history, maybe we wanted an ending with more 'punch' to our bodies!but Kubrick could turn his madness in mystery,but in spite its mistakes 'ACO' is a movie to not let to see,be strong,that is the main condition.",7,0,3,25 December 2006
The Untouchables," Good,De Palma is talented but sometimes he abuses
","It's a good movie,no great,it could be better if De Palma went more slowly,sometimes runs at 250 km/h when it's only needed 50,to make one thing in excess damages the total plot,the famous scene at the ladder in slow-motion when Ness rescues the baby looked like a 'Six Million Dollar man''s scheme,there's no need to do that,Why did De Palma put on screen a weak,foolish Ness?,i got the cold and stoned image from the Stacks' performance in the late 50's.Who's the true Ness?Sean Connery WAS THE MOVIE,out of series,he is more than 007,let's deliver that character to Roger Moore,good but not exceptional as Sean who did it well to leave that funny but so limited role no availably to give him awards and deserved acknowledging,De Niro was good too,maybe a little bit clown-esquire Capone,but at the height of the circunstances.De Palma is talented,but the abuse of handling has caused his last downfalls and his becoming dusk :'The Bonfire of the Vanities','Femme Fatale' and the more than a 'Mission Impossible' (without caring its success at the box-office) are evidence about it.",6,0,1,28 July 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Maybe the best ever:Love never dies!
","When we think about Dracula,the images of Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee from 'Hammer' come to our memories(greased and backed hair and their fr ac in 'pinguin'),but here Coppola wished to get close the more possible to the Irish drunkard Bram Stoker,then Dracula(a genial Gary Oldman) a former soldier of Christ fighting the Otomanian warriors on the 15th Century quits from God,because the turk invaders to hoax the romanian people are making believe Elizabetta(a talented Wynona Ryder)his dear beloved one was deceased,the young bride gets suicide in a moment of messing up,Vlad Tepes stabs a Holy Cross damning God and all the sacred mysteries,drinking the blood of the hurts of the Lord, Dracoul gets immortality,after 5 centuries a young lawyer Jonathan Harker(Keanu Reeves) is caged in the Dracula's Castle placed into Transilvania to can sell to Vlad the 'Carfax Abbey' outside London, now Dracula traveling in a ship his deadly containers,the horror starts:a sailor was missing,Lucy (Sadie Frost)the rich girl and the best pal of Mina(Ryder again and reincarnated!)is bitten by the wicked spirit,Jonathan held prisoner along with 3 pretty vampire women(a gorgeous Monica Bellucci heading his bloody abduction)could escape to try to advice English people about the awful monster stalking in the darkness,when the Lucy's fiancé looked in a despair Van Helsing(awesome Sir Anthony Hopkins!)is called to combat the tainted vampire,and running through Europe to end his menaces against the human race.Some observations:Why so ridiculous hairdo? Dracula looked in the beginning like a fag with 2 white giant balls in his head,an unnecessary long red jacket dragging across the floor,some kind of chronological contradiction between his arriving and his wild attack against Lucy, an interesting tribute to the original 'Nosferatu'(the shadows over the wall showing his over nailed hands),a dislikeable scene almost gay with Jonathan shaving and cutting out his neck,the look of Vlad:a wolf,a black vampire,a white bat(when Van Helsing was blessing his 'cave' Dracoul seemed to attack Van Helsing and allies,but Mina was his target instead),the long hair and mustaches like the original Vlad Tepes Dracoul never used in the classical movies of our childhood, Vlad could walk even in the daylight(Mina was met of that way),Bellucci dissolved the Jonathan's cross to suck him(but Dracula could not with another),yet with mistakes and 'goofs' this movie is better than all the made until now,though if those wrong stuffs hadn't been the result may have been superior,but it's a good flick in all the cases.",7,0,1,2 January 2007
Trainspotting," Born slippy fuxxs!!!
","This extraordinary movie called 'Trainspotting' is not an apology to the sex and drug like the one track minded donkeys argue,it's the story of a foursome of misfits and unadapted freaky,going against the rotten and boring system,a hallucinating journey against the establishment,the first running through the grey streets of Edimburg presents a thief but reflexive Renton(the phenomenal Ewan MC Gregor)and his famous phrase 'choose...' and the beat of 'Lust for life' by Iggy Pop,from the beginning we felt the vertigo of this flick,the rest of the meanies Sickboy(Johnny Lee Miller)a total drugged fan of 007,Spud(Bremmner)the nerd of the pack,Begbie(a sinister as amoral Robert Carlyle,he reminds me a little bit of Gary Oldman) seemed the 'smartest wise-guy' of the bunch,he seemed the more,more, a crazy racing of easy and hard dopes,crimes,nights of disco and the next step the sex(THE WISE GUY was not,found a herring drag!!!)will show us Diane apart,the world of decadence product of a society full of hypocrisy and false values. The final and worst 'travel' by Renton result of the coke is the point of the break,a splendid 'Perfect Day' by Lou Reed serves like a bizarre guide to our antihero:'You're going to reap just what you sow' road to the hospital,the ultimate sting showed us the time to change,after to commit a steal the quartet sleeps in a cheap hostel,Begbie so secure in himself takes care the bounty,but Renton gets the money despite the Begbie's 'safeness',in the road to the 'choose your life' he thinks about his already former pals:Begbie a wicked guy forever,Sickboy a doped bulk forever,but Spud was rewarded because he was only a little bit misled but capable to put straight the new path. Beating us Underworld with the rushing 'Born Slippy Nuxx'(a great hit from an excellent soundtrack)Renton decides to get a normal life: wife, children, TV,car,his own house,an average job and the more stuffs of the consumer society for today;great story so many mistaken guys can wish the Renton's real craving:The redemption to oneself. A total movie of cult without unnecessary crimes and charmless slayers as bad actors(Lewis&Harrelson)like 'NBK' and shameless of their loathly acts,so close to 'A clockwork Orange'(note in the disco the fair tribute to the 'ACO')but Boyle is not Kubrick and there is the difference,nevertheless the movie is superb and the end delivered us a positive message of being a new person,even when we may be in disagree with cruel the society in which we live in. To want to be 'someone else,someone new' like Reed wrote his tune.",8,1,3,18 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best of the saga!! The Yoda's philosophy.
","'The Empire Strikes Back' shall be the greatest highlight in all the STAR WARS' collection,from the cold and frozen planet Hoth(What a contradiction to name!)the rebel cause faces the new imperial attack, to see Hamill's face in the first scene:scared and looked too old for only 3 years in difference respect the first one,he crashed his car a few time ago,then the fatal consequences can be noted at all.But following the tale,a great 'Big-feet tanks' along spaceships of the Palpatine's forces will obligate Rebels to take a long outrunning and holding back,Luke goes to look for the old ancient midget called Yoda former leader of the vanished Jedis at the swamped depths of the planet Dagobah,Solo,Chew,Leia and her droids is going,after to escape of the Imperial float,to the sky-scraped city called Cloud city ruled by Lando Carlrissian a former smuggler old friend of Han Solo,but they are betrayed by Lando,a frozen alive in carbonite Solo shows the image of the total defeat of the rebels and being captured Leia and friends,Lukes faces Vader,even he didn't complete all his training to be a new Jedi,but the thrilling fight goes to a an unsuspected final when Vader ripped the Luke's right hand and exclaims an already classical phrase:'I'm your father!'(What a moment of emotion,we stayed stoned in the theater before so terrific confession!!,and Luke preferring falling down in the emptiness void refusing to join for the wicked Empiror Palpatine obsessed to drift Luke, when the death seemed so close a repented Lando driving 'The Millennium Falcon' saved the handless Luke,aboard with Chewbacca,Leia and droids,they installed an artificial hand to the beaten Luke,but Boba Fett the merciless mercenary on service to Jabba The Hutt has flown with the Solo's cold body made a block of a living statue.The final scene when Luke embraces Leia looking to the infinite of the space is full of tenderness,and shows the real feeling in all this great movie of sci-fi;Kasdan & Kerschner delivered the enough heat and emotion to this never to be forgotten movie of galactic adventure full of romance,humor,drama and action never to be equaled by the rest of the series created by the hailed George Lucas.But the adventure will follow in a far galaxy very far away from all of us....",9,1,2,24 August 2006
Sin City," Rourke and Willis in a same movie,we waited for so long!!
","Too much to comment but to start: The man(Josh Harnett)a handsome psycho killer(some kind of Ted Bundy?),his victims:pretty women of course,but in this fantastic movie THE BEGINNING AND THE END GO LIKE A MERRY-GO-ROUND!; a good cop as heart-attacked Hartigan(Willis)rescues the wrong victim:a defend-less child called Nancy from the claws of an insane thug called Junior(Nick Stahl)son of a corrupted senator Mr. Roark(Powers Boothe),Hartigan shots several times the thief,but Bob (Madsen)his betrayer partner shots him at his back,the tramp is completed,Hartigan is unfairly accused of kidnapping and raping the poor child,the jail will be his reality for 8 mourned years,meanwhile Marv a former convict is framed too:a pretty whore called Goldie(Jamie King)was killed when she slept with the ugly guy,police men can't stop Marv,when he goes home we see the prettiest parole officer ever desired Lucille(Gugino,please bust me now!!),regrettably a sicked 'nerd-killer' will be the beginning of the end of so gorgeous girl, outrunning from the unfair justice Marv discovers the corruption in the Church,Cardinal Roark(Hauer) is a part of the cancer,after the respective wiping,with the 'nerd-slayer' included,Marv is taken prisoner by pretty sluts in their own ghetto,the Goldie's twin sister Jamie blames Marv about the murder,but he could prove his innocence before all the 'easy girls'.But Marv will follow his path until... the electric chair!perhaps the evil Jamie was too much blind to realize,and the city of sluts is menaced by Jackie Boy( a st upend Del Toro so laughable!!!)a shameless cop looking for new bounties!!,then Dwight(so good Clive Owen!!)a good friend of the chicks faces the mean visitors when a waitress called Shellie(Murphy)is stalked by the bad cops,after they are massacred,Miho(Aoki)leading the butcher's concert,Dwight goes to find help to the fiend ladies(no cops,no pimps) when mercenaries stops him after to forbear Jackie's jokes(the corpse of course)and carrying ripped bodies in an old heap,but when he sinks in a pit o maybe to be baptizes 'quick oiled tar' Miho rescues him,noticing him about the pretty slut called Gail(so sexy Rosario Dawson!)was abducted by a gruesome hulk called Manute(Clarke Duncan),the rescue goes so bloody,so funny to watch Jackie's faces taped and exploding before the slashing revenge;returning to our main hero,here i was so amazed:Hartigan was jailed 8 years,Nancy(Cordelia according to the sicked Junior Roark)always sent him letters never forgetting him,after his parole,Bob picks him up from the jail,forgiving the Bob's betrayal and looking for Nancy,her house was ransacked,and the worst idea because they sent him a teen's finger to the jail,Hartingan finds a clue to take him in a sordid night club,and Nancy(already an adult J. Alba) is a cow-girl dancing over the tables,Jackie and Marv in first file!!, when they cross their looks,she jumped through the tables,going away with the veteran former cop,but an awful shadow of the past now called yellow bastard(the same Junior)captures them,and hanging on the death Hartingan rescues Nancy again and killing the 'mutant'.If i haven't given a 9 of notes,it's only for personal motives:Lucille (Carla Gugino i love you!!!What a slim fit body in a mini-trouser!!)died so early,they never exploding her beautifulness in more scenes to delight our eyes,and Why to make a suicidal Hartigan?,after all we wanted a complete scene Willis-Roarke together(better care they are so similar in their faces!!)and this didn't happened,in Sin City 2,Willis won't be present,and the awaited scene won't be made(both of them had bad partners in another films,f.ex:Don Johnson,only to be with P.M Thomas making the excellent 'Miami vice',appeared with Roarke in the ill-fated 'Marlboro..',Willis was lost in several times like '6th. Sense' and more miscast ed roles,only to play by some different performer).But despite of these opinions,this movie was hallucinating,performers in the mood,specially Del Toro,he made me laugh so much,i confess about the comic,i haven't seen it so much as i wanna read it,but comparing with the movie is almost the same hot stuff:bl/white photos,a few hints of colored details,a plot in total harmony with the cameras(Marv dragging around that thug with his car!What a shot!) and blanked shadows!;Noir to the top!!,i reminded Cagney,Dick Tracy,french classics,Untouchables(TV series),some of Bogart and more masterpieces of the 7th. Art,Rodriguez left the awful'Mariachi' behind,and Tarantino the guest director,i mean he's overrated,but this time did it better than his grotesque 'Pulp Fiction'(those crappy scenes never to remember about the rapists and Willis were naughty,loathly,that wasted the film!!!)but here was used its original narrative for good,Frank Miller did a great comic- book better than his offensive and bad-penciled 'Dark Knight',but 'Sin City' has entered through the big door,and we want for more.....Good adaptation of a comic-book,better learn Bryan Singer!!!",7,0,1,23 August 2006
Donnie Darko," INCREDIBLE MOVIE,so hard to understand!!
","From the cover of the DVD i stayed amazed,i passed to another world, surrealism in a pure dose,a world in another space,maybe a 4th. dimension,the soundtrack takes us to a journey through those years, What can change our world? Is our willingness or after all it is written in the stairs?(as John Lennon said),all the actors played so smartly the game:Gyllenhaal with his grainy,bitter face,Drew and her fatal sexy-tenderness,Swayze a mild-mannered deceiver,Katherine Ross(i didn't see her a long,long time ago)made the point,Maggie was OK,and i'm still feeling there are so many mysteries that aren't unveiled.In my head will always remain 'till the on the times that unforgettable image about those girls dancing on the yard of the school under the progressive tones from 'Head over Heels ' a state of minded-son, caging you with that astounding sound created by Orzabal-Smith AND THEIR MAGIC KEYBOARD. Please,better watch this supernatural movie to enter in a new dimension,my life won't be the same after this lost link of the celluloid.",8,1,3,26 July 2006
The Birds," Free as a bird!!
","The genius Hitchcock scared me indeed,i saw this thrilling movie when i was 10,my family and me stared a real horror:birds taking revenge against human race,several years of hunting,torture seemed to take a real shape,the FX considering those early years of the blue screen were amazing,some is not agree about that stuff,but there hadn't the high budget and the new digital effects of the present,a flock of outraged pigeons,gulls,ravens and more feather some beings were flying over our heads!!Yes,i felt in that dreadful situation along with Tippi Heddren,Suzanne Pleshette,Rod Taylor or the grinny Veronica Cartwright (she made us shiver in 'Alien' spreading the fear 16 years after), although some kind of doubt left with the end:Did the birds take it easy again? or Was the end of the humans? I got to say something:UNTIL THE 60'S THE HAPPY ENDS WERE A DUTY,but Hitchcock puts a half formula between the happy or the unhappy,since i remember the 70's broke that repeated solution and the bad guys could triumph or waiting to live again to slaughter the 'goodies'.If you don't like Hitchcock,don't watch any movie,you'll lose your time it's for sure that you don't understand the good films at all.",7,2,3,7 August 2006
