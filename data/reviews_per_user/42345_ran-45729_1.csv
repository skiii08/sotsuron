The Finest Hours," For anyone who ever worked at sea this film is impossible to watch
","The finest hours is obviously made by talented screenplay writers, actors, editors etc...it is directed professionally no argue there. However for anyone who has ever been more than a day at sea or anyone from a seafaring community this film is impossible to watch. Every single minute contains inaccuracies ranging from minor details like getting the equipment of that time wrong, to outrageously unrealistic mis en scene. This film simply gets it wrong on conditions at sea, groups or individual characters, the language that would have been used, the actions that men would and would not take in heavy weather conditions, group behaviour, ships hierarchy, use of instruments.... It is hard to watch characters perform actions that would get them killed almost instantly in reality and there is a minimum level of realism required to any story. Please get it right next time Disney. 2 points out of 10.",2,39,63,28 October 2016
