National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Meh
","The plot was pretty weak and overall wasn't very interesting, it's very easy to either forget most of the movie or mix it up with the first one. There seem to be a lot of inaccuracies with the film, and I'm sincerely hoping no one actually believes a lot of what they saw. It's also a exceptionally strange story, if you thought it was wild for Nicolas Cage to steal the Declaration of Independence then be prepared to be shocked by how Cage convinces the President of the United States to follow him through a shady looking tunnel as a step to finding a treasure that may or may not actually exist. It's a good movie if you don't have high standards, or if you like movies that are easy to follow.",5,0,0,10 May 2016
Knowing," Fun to watch, leaves too many loose ends
","It isn't difficult to connect the details to know how the movie ends, but it is a little hard to specifically understand the ending. At no point was there any reasoning about why these children were chosen, what the aliens wanted, why these tragedies were listed along with the end of the world, and why the trailer was listed in the coordinates. With that being said, it overall was an enjoyable movie to watch. It was very intense, and difficult to watch scenes where Nicolas Cage's character would attempt to help the disaster victims, only for him to fail. It was both depressing and refreshing to watch his character simply accept his fate at the end, since most of the movie was watching him frantically try to understand what was going on and if there was a way to stop it.",7,0,0,24 February 2016
National Treasure," Fun Movie
","It's a fun movie to watch with your family, and is also rather memorable, but isn't the best. It has an interesting take on American history, which may not be quite as appealing to some people, and it's likely that kids won't understand parts of it. While not historically accurate, it's easy to follow. Another issue with the movie would be how quickly the characters solve puzzles and find clues. Of course it's not a realistic movie, but really it should have taken them at least a few months to find the treasure, even a few years. As long as you don't take the movie very seriously, it's not bad and is a fun movie to watch with friends and family.",7,0,0,5 April 2016
Moonrise Kingdom," It was enjoyable
","Watching this feels like watching any other Wes Anderson movie, but there is a notable lack of character development. One would think that the characters learned a lot about themselves and each other, but by the end it seemed that hardly anything had really changed, other than the boy and the girl kind of end up together. The casting was good, but again, the lack of character development almost ruins the cast. It would've been interesting to see the changes in Edward Norton and Bill Murray's characters. There also wasn't much of a backstory for anyone, excluding the police chief who reveals his loneliness and his affair with the mother. This was an enjoyable movie to watch, but I wish that there was more detail with characters.",7,0,0,10 May 2016
