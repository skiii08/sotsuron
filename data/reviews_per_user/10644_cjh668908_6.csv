The Blair Witch Project," There's nothing worse than shaky camcorder footage
","This 'movie' is a 'documentary' about the so-called Blair witch legend. It was marketed and hyped up as a true story, that three teenagers went into the woods in search of the Blair witch in October 1994 and never returned. Then their camcorder footage was found a year later.The whole idea behind this movie was to scare its audience with the concept of making the audience get frightened of things they don't see. It's called psychological horror. Other horror movies of the past have accomplished this goal. The Haunting (1963) is a perfect example. The Haunting was a professionally made movie with a musical score, the whole nine yards. In contrast, The Blair Witch Project was filmed with a camcorder and a shaky one at that. There is no music in the film. It's raw. It has a skeletal budget. It has the sounds of the day and the sounds of the night and the sounds of profane teenagers. It's basically a 'reality' film about some teens who are lost in the woods in search of a legendary witch that supposedly lives there. The fact that they're looking for a witch and lost at the same time makes them increasingly frightened and frustrated as the movie progresses.The main problem I have with this film is that the footage is so shaky and amateur-ish. This movie is unwatchable. It'll make you dizzy and give you a headache. It's fine to use a camcorder. I thought it was a unique way to film a documentary 'movie'. But at least make the footage watchable. I can understand the camera shaking at times when the kids are running away from something that's scaring them, but to have shaky footage when they're just sitting around and talking or when planning their trip is really inexcusable. If I want to watch really bad and I mean REALLY bad and shaky camcorder footage, I can watch any one of the countless lame and shaky videos that people I know have made throughout the years. I don't know what's so hard about keeping a steady camera. This film would have been better if the camera-work was better. Instead of feeling scared, I found myself being distracted by the terrible camera-work and feeling dizzy with a headache, also. The bad camera-work robbed me of any scared feeling I was supposed to have when watching this film.",1,3,4,27 February 2013
The Shining," Classic horror movie
","The Shining (1980) is based on the novel by Stephen King. Director Stanley Kubrick gave us a masterpiece. I like nearly everything about this movie. I remember seeing it on cable TV around 1980 and 1981. This is a different kind of horror movie in that it is not over the top with LOTS of blood and gore and LOTS of killing. Instead, it's a movie that has a moderate amount of blood and killings (with the exception of the scene with the tidal wave of blood), but it's greatest strength is its reliance on atmosphere and the gradual buildup of tension and horror. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) gradually becomes a madman over time. Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) becomes increasingly terrified. Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) is effective as the son that possesses psychic abilities. The story and setting are very simple. The hotel itself seems to be a character itself. The atmosphere in the hotel is eerie with a sense of emptiness, but frightening. There's a feeling that strange and horrifying things are bound to happen in this huge vacant hotel. Again, the buildup to all-out madness is the movie's strongest point.The camera angles that are used at times are very innovative.The best acting performance in this movie was by Shelley Duvall, in my opinion. She was totally believable. Jack Nicholson also gave a great performance.The electronic musical score is great and very memorable. It's the kind of music that crawls under your skin and adds to a tense atmosphere.This movie is a classic that has stood the test of time. It's definitely one of the all-time great horror movies. Stephen King himself actually hated it, but horror movie fans generally like it. I highly recommend The Shining to all horror fans.",10,0,1,8 January 2011
The Dark Knight," Good, not great
","Anybody who has seen or heard of this movie knows the hype surrounding Heath Ledger as The Joker. Ledger definitely 'became' another person or character to the point where you would never know it's Heath Ledger under the clown makeup, because he drastically changed his voice and mannerisms in his own portrayal of The Joker. It's also hard to recognize Ledger PHYSICALLY because the black makeup around his eyes makes it harder to tell it's him, versus if he had white makeup around his eyes, like Jack Nicholson did. I must say that Jack Nicholson's Joker would have been even better if he would have changed his voice and mannerisms so it would be harder to tell it was him underneath that makeup. Ledger's Joker was not truly Joker-like overall, even if his portrayal is how the comic book Joker 'supposedly' is (that's very debatable). His portrayal of The Joker was adequate for this realistic modern Batman movie. Cesar Romero's version was good for the campy 1960s TV series and the 1966 movie, and Jack Nicholson's version was good for the 1989 movie. But I often think of Ledger's famous line, 'Why so serious?' I think that's a legitimate question he could have asked HIMSELF - 'Why so serious?' Not enough laughing and clowning around for my tastes. Ledger did a good job ACTING, but the Joker should be funnier and live up to his name, The Joker. There should be a balance of evilness and dark humor. The Heath Ledger Joker was 85% evil, 15% funny. In contrast, the Jack Nicholson Joker was about 50% evil, 50% funny. But in defense of Ledger, he had to do what Christopher Nolan wanted him to do, for the most part. Unfortunately, Nolan's 'realistic' approach to Batman doesn't allow The Joker to be truly Joker-like.It was nice to see that this movie gave a tip of the hat to Cesar Romero during the bank robbery scene at the beginning of the movie. Heath Ledger is wearing a mask that is nearly identical to the one that Cesar Romero wore during the TV series episode The Joker Is Wild (1966). Romero wore the mask while singing opera at The Gotham City Opera Company during the Pagliacci performance.I don't understand why the cops, after capturing The Joker, didn't wash the makeup off The Joker's face so they could see who's underneath the makeup. I would think that would be the first thing they'd do, but they didn't do it. If you like comic book movies with a lot of realism and seriousness to them where humor is almost nonexistent, then this will be your cup of tea. This movie has everything -- explosions, references to DNA, the latest technological gadgets, you name it. You know the setting is in 2008 when you watch it. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 5 because I think it fell short as far as having a true Batman comic book movie feel to it and for the lack of humor. I think this movie is way too serious and humorless. It tries to be so realistic, yet we've got Harvey Dent walking around with open wounds on his face, half of which is missing. Apparently there's no such thing as infections in this realistic world of Gotham City in The Dark Knight. Also, in a 'realistic' world, if there was a guy roaming the streets wearing greasepaint on his face, people would laugh at him and not take him seriously and he'd get arrested easily, just like that 'real life Spiderman' guy from a few years ago who appeared on the news climbing buildings. Any kook like that gets arrested. Easily. The same can be said about Batman, a guy dressed in a bat suit. People in a 'realistic' world would laugh at him. If you're going to make a movie based on comic book characters, make it look like a comic book movie, not something that looks like a realistic and serious cop drama on prime time TV. On the other hand, if you insist on taking the 'realistic' cop drama approach, you might as well go all the way with it. In other words, don't have anything in the movie that's unrealistic or unbelievable, such as Harvey Dent's face. Otherwise, the realism starts to get diluted and leaves you scratching your head.Tim Burton got it right. He took the approach of making a comic book movie look like a comic book movie, which allowed him to get away with unrealistic and unbelievable things. Why is it that Christopher Nolan is ending the series after three movies, with The Dark Knight Rises being the final movie? It's very simple - he's running out of believable villains that he can use in his 'realistic' crime drama world he's created. You can't have The Penguin in the realistic world he's created. You can't have Mr. Freeze, either. You can't have Poison Ivy, and on and on and on. Those are vintage comic book villains that simply would not fit into Nolan's Gotham City, which, by the way, looks too ordinary. Why does the Ledger Joker wear greasepaint on his face and green dye in his hair instead of being a guy who has white skin and green hair as a result of falling into a vat of chemicals? The answer is because in the realistic Nolan world, chemically discolored skin and hair couldn't happen. Why doesn't the Ledger Joker use a squirting lapel flower, a hand buzzer, etc.? The answer is because in Nolan's realistic world, these things would come off as unrealistic and campy. When you think about all the things I've mentioned, you can easily see that Nolan has sucked most of the character, life, feel, and atmosphere out of the Batman that we knew from the time period circa 1940 - 2005. Look at what he's done to the characters as well, including the iconic Joker.",8,1,3,7 January 2013
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Visually stunning
","This movie came out in 1992. I like this movie. It's visually stunning with great special effects, sets, and costumes. However, the movie doesn't follow Bram Stoker's novel exactly. I know a lot of people dislike this, but I don't mind when it comes to this movie and also Dracula (1979). I'm more fussy when OTHER movies out there don't follow the novel they're based on exactly, or they massacre the story completely, such as what was done in the 'remake' of The Haunting (1999). Now that, I have a problem with.How is the acting in this movie? It's very good, for the most part. I like Winona Ryder in her role as Mina Harker. She did a good job. Gary Oldman as Dracula was pretty good. I don't care for his long hair and sunglasses later in the movie, but I like when he's an old guy in the beginning of the movie. Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker was OK, while Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was good.When I compare the Draculas from this movie and the 1979 movie, my favorite is Frank Langella from the 1979 movie. He had more of the classic look of Dracula.The Gothic atmosphere, darkness, and overall feel is hard to beat. The movie definitely has a Transylvania feel to it and is visually stunning. The night scenes are especially good. Excellent use of lighting, darkness, shadows, and everything macabre.The musical score by Wojciech Kilar is good.I think the second half of the movie isn't as good as the first half. I also think that Dracula got pretty wimpy late in the movie. To me, he showed tremendous weakness when it came to his relationship with Mina.Overall, a good movie that should hold your attention.",8,1,2,8 January 2011
The Woman in Black," Dark and creepy ghost story
","The Woman In Black (2012) is a remake of the 1989 TV movie of the same name and based on the 1983 book by Susan Hill. This remake is actually better than the original, a rare feat. From my experience, usually remakes of horror movies are nowhere near as good as the original. This is an exception.The things that this movie have going for it are the dark, chilling, spooky atmosphere and the genuine creepiness of the haunted house from the Victorian era. You'll see classic components of a haunted house - cobwebs, paintings hanging on the walls, lit candles, a rocking chair rocking by itself, creepy looking dolls, music box melodies, and of course ghosts. Throw in the thunderstorm and the movie feels complete. This is definitely one of the creepiest and best ghost story movies I've ever seen. There are a lot of sudden scares that might you jump out of your seat. There is an occasional dose of comic relief sprinkled throughout the movie. The musical score by Marco Beltrami is decent.This movie was my introduction to Daniel Radcliffe (I've never seen the Harry Potter movies). He does a commendable job acting. This movie is a triumphant return for Hammer Horror. Who can forget the classic Hammer horror movies from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s? Overall, this is a good Victorian ghost story that I highly recommend.",9,0,1,12 February 2012
Saboteur," Very underrated
","Saboteur (1942) is a somewhat forgotten Hitchcock suspense thriller. It stars Robert Cummings, Priscilla Lane, Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, and Norman Lloyd. One thing about this movie is that it has some striking similarities to The 39 Steps (1935) and North By Northwest (1959). A man who is falsely accused of something is chased across the country with a climax that takes place on a national monument. This movie has some humor in it, but overall it is darker than North By Northwest. It can be classified as a World War II propaganda movie and clocks in at 1 hour, 49 minutes. Hitchcock recycled a lot of his movie themes and plots over the years, and basically I see this movie as a trailblazer for the superior North By Northwest, although Saboteur is a good movie, no doubt. I really like this movie's black and white cinematography and overall atmosphere, particularly the scenes at night. You never know what you'll encounter when you're traveling across the country at night. Watch to find out what's encountered.The acting overall is pretty good. The musical score by Frank Skinner is run-of-the-mill. It does the job, but it's nothing that's very distinctive. The movie has a good dose of classic Hitchcock suspense. I find that the more I watch this movie the more I like it.",8,1,3,24 February 2013
