Blade Runner 2049," Bloated Gorgeous Sci Fi
","This film should be made available to fans to reconfigure into a masterpiece.All the elements for greatness are there. Just held down by excessive and often unnecessary scenes, and occasionally clunky acting choices and dialogue. 
. 
The first 20 minutes are mind blowing and exciting, and then the film goes off the rails, occasionally landing in awesomeness, then once again meandering through annoying information that loses the viewer. 
I immediately wanted to own the movie so I could live in that gorgeous depiction of a unique world. By the end I thought, no, I would have to fast forward through way too much crap to get to the essential moments.So many great things, such a shame it wasn't edited by an objective passionate professional with an eye for getting to the point.I have a feeling it was a case of the old corporate 'too many self-important chefs in the kitchen' diluting the stew into a watery soup.**why was Harrison Ford dressed in Old Navy when every other character had amazing futuristic designer wardrobes?***could future screenwriters please retire the cliche of a character turning to another character after a violent event and asking 'Are you ok?' Obviously that character is not ok...yet they always respond 'Yes'. And do we need every fight to last and last and last and last. Boring.",8,0,3,15 December 2017
Ready Player One," Stupendous (with one reservation)
","A visual spectacle jampacked with so much information, it's almost impossible for one puny human brain to process it all. The 'camera moves' look more like a computer is directing than a human being limited by camera placement. It all feels like another leap forward in cinematographic possibilities. If you are a movie and video game geek and you were born in the 70's you will adore the nostalgia. Millennials will love the message of fighting the corporate behemoth of greed and inflation that will probably make this Oasis world a very distinct probability for the vast majority of us that will be priced out of the world of luxury that is dangled in front of our eyes by the financial elite. (Many of us are now living the majority of our lives in screen virtual reality already.)
I did lose interest during the now obligatory massive violent battle sequence as this has become a loud boring cliche and an incredibly dull storytelling technique due to its sheer overuse by every single blockbuster film, but overall a superfun and inspiring 'underdog prevailing' flick. See this on the big screen!",10,1,4,3 April 2018
Mother!," If Adam Sandler and the Wayans Brothers teamed up to film 'Art Movie: The Movie'
","...this would be the result: a blender full of previously seen art house clich√©s eliciting an occasional laugh at how ridiculously stupid what just happened in front of your eyes is.If your time is precious on Planet Earth, avoid at all costs. If you have no aim in life other than to be annoyed and irritated by passive spectacle, more power to you, you have found the motherload.Some positive takeaways:Jennifer Lawrence is so beautiful to stare at and ridiculously talented as an actress. Michell Pfieffer acts perfectly as the kind of toxic older woman we all should cut out of our lives. Ed Harris is a stellar man of mystery/genial stranger. Javier Bardem is a solid macho asshole/sociopath/narcissistic artist. Interesting claustrophobic camera work.At least it didn't utilize the current lazy storytelling technique of untold minutes of AK-47s firing at random villains...oh wait, it did....Hey, at least the producers succeeded in suckering a bunch of us sheeple to fund their lavish lifestyles.",1,69,134,28 September 2017
