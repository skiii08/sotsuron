Skyfall," fooled by advertising!
","this film is a perfect example how media influences people in their choice what they gonna do and think.bond is and was everywhere. if you have radio/internet/television you know that there is a new bond; and not only that, you want to see it, you have to see it...it's a shame. especially IMDb seems to be manipulated these days!this film is just utter garbage. for sure i don't want to expect more from a bond movie than being a bond movie, but there was just no flow, no drive, no funny humor, no thrilling action, no interesting characters, no cool/hot bond girl, no villain to fear; no story that made at least a little bit of sense...(yeah MAYBE there where MOMENTS where you had the feeling 'oh, in a good movie this could have been decent', therefore 2 stars, not 1...)with the super poor writing combined with bad directing and production at least you cannot really blame the actors...make up your mind, it's not about personal preference (only if you say i like bad movies...) this film is really really bad; it only sucks ... people in because of propaganda!",2,27,63,5 November 2012
