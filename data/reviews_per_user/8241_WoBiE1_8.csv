Alien 3," Well done, David Fincher; well done.
","Having just purchased the Alien Legacy on DVD this past week, I have had the chance to revisit all the Alien movies and appreciate the different approaches that each director takes. I have to say that Alien 3 went down better then when I had originally seen it back in 1992. David Fincher has such a great eye for detail in every shot that is filmed. The only thing that I had a problem with is the tension that he tried to build but just wasn't working. The last scene in which the alien is chasing the prisoners throughout the corridors was nice to look at, but it came up short on the 'scare' scale. If I would have seen the alien itself move at the blazing speeds that the camera was moving at, it would have been more effective.As for the story, it was meant to displease the audience, and Fincher just seems to be too eager to do so. Casting problems might have prevented the return of the little Carrie Henn(she wouldn't have been so little in Alien 3 anyway) and Michael Biehn. To just kill of Newt in the very beginning of Alien 3, especially if you have seen the director's cut of Aliens, is absolutely heart-wrenching. For those who have not seen the director's cut of Aliens(which is available alone or in the new Alien Legacy box set on VHS and DVD as well as on a special edition laserdisc), it expands the maternal side of Ripley's persona. Definitely worth seeing if you are an Alien fan. Even if you haven't seen the director's cut, it is still a major disappointment to see the poor Newt dead.With all this being said, Alien 3 works. It just does. David Fincher's tight direction and uncanny visual style save what would have been a horrible Alien experience. Once again, Weaver's performance as Ripley is superb. The rest of the cast gives excellent performances throughout. The story has its disappointing side, but it can be seen as admirable as well. You have to admire the writers for having the audacity to create such a disturbing world that is this prison from hell. I would have liked to see further developments in the Alien's species. James Cameron did it extremely well by introducing the alien queen. Other than that, great creative effort that offers something different, and this time different is good.",9,0,4,7 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Luke and Leia they are not......
","....but Anakin and Amidala are extremely fun to watch. Their relationship thus far has been limited to the fact that Anakin is only in his pre-teens, but it will grow and become an integral part of the next two prequels. George Lucas needs to be commended in bringing this BEAUTIFUL world of his to life in a manner that no one has ever seen before. Do yourself a favor and check out the wonderful vistas that are presented here. Under water cities and vast desert scapes are all alive with an array of different species that have become a trademark of the Star Wars Saga. Liam and Ewan are great Jedi knights that are believable and absolutely fun to watch. The Jedi reign is in full force here. Oh, let's not forget the music!! John William's score from beginning to end adds so much more to the action, that we are pulled into this universe which makes this movie so much more. Bravo. And Darth Maul.....what a EVIL villain. His mere presence would make anyone want to run and find the nearest Jedi, so he could kick his butt. The one dude that really annoyed me was(say it with me now), Jar-Jar Binks. His speech is at times so incomprehensible, it can become distracting. I'm sure the young ones will want to have a Jar-Jar all their own, and that is because he is completely a 'living' cartoon. In that respect, he is a success. Let's not forget the phantom menace itself. What a great setup for the next two films.  Finally, I would like to say that it is not up to snuff with the existing trilogy, but it is an EXTREMELY welcomed addition to the whole saga. Just sit and get ready to be blown away by the 'STAR WARS' emblem and the famous John William's score; it's definitely worth the price of admission. Every saga has a beginning and what a beginning it is. Very well done, Mr.Lucas. ***1/2.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hey, it's Star Wars!!
","I'm sure you've heard all the negative aspects said about this movie, so I won't bore you by going into depth about them(well maybe just a little depth). All in all, its was a GOOD film. Not great, but good. I don't care how much CGI you pack into a movie, or how engrossing the images may be; I want better dialogue. The story was adequate for what Lucas set out to accomplish, but there were many scenes that seem to be just thrown in there to show off the computer images. THEY DIDN'T SERVE THE PLOT AND THAT IS MY MAJOR GRIPE ABOUT THIS FILM. Don't try to dazzle me with images. Make my want to see it again by telling a story that is hard to forget with interesting dialogue and compelling characters. The casting was dead on; you couldn't ask for a better queen or a little Skywalker. The Jedi Knights, Qui Gon and Obi Wan were great also........but some of the things they have to say are sometimes laughable. I love Star Wars movies; I really do. I just wanted more, and the hype that surrounds this movie will only prove to hinder its success. Episode II will be better; George Lucas has given us a taste of what's to come, and if he can develop an engrossing story with truly satisfying revelations, EVERYONE will love it, guaranteed. Just look at 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Oh yes, the future of the Star Wars movies looks very bright indeed.",10,0,0,30 May 1999
The Mummy," What fun!!
","To say the least, I liked this movie.  It was in the grand tradition as the time it was set.  Beautiful sets and vistas with great special effects that don't overpower what is just an old-fashioned American adventure only hollywood could provide.  Don't I sound cheesy or what; all I know is I can't wait for the sequel. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are just beautiful together, and Arnold Vosloo is one terrific mummy. See this movie...on the widescreen DVD with great extras....=D.",9,0,0,17 October 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Visual story telling at its finest
",I love Tim Burton.  I really do.  Tim Burton has created an utterly fascinating world of images that are beyond compare.  Truly original designs of 18th century cottages and smoke walkways are prevalent throughout the entire film.  Acting was inspired as well; I haven't seen Depp perform this well since Burton's own Edward Scissorhands.  Christina Ricci gives a fine performance but is lacking somewhat an emotional depth. The bottom line is that the visuals are the real stars of the show.  They give a sense of escapism I haven't felt in many movies.  The headless horseman is shown with immense style without overly exposing his true form.  A foreboding sense of horror is always a primary goal.  A must see for all.,9,0,0,21 November 1999
Aliens," A milestone in movie making....
","Just recently, I have purchased the new Alien Legacy box set on DVD, and each one is excellent. Aliens is the second chapter in the Alien saga and is probably the most remembered by today's generation. Let's face it; it changed the way sci-fi movies were made forever,and it hasn't been for the best(I'm not saying Aliens is a bad film). Aliens set such a high standard in action sci-fi(basically the new genre the James Cameron has created) that none of the copycats can compete. Take the recent movies Soldier and Event Horizon(both directed by Paul Anderson). They both try to be Alien movies but do not succeed. My advice to Mr. Anderson is to stop trying to copy what has already been done. Enough said.As for Aliens, it is a perfect sci-fi action movie. Great casting(although ALL are stereotypes), great music(James Horner is the man), great use of technology and  a well written script are all present. Weaver's performance is outstanding; one of the best action heroes of all time just happens to be a woman. If you have a chance to watch the director' cut of Aliens, I suggest you take it(it's available in the new Alien Legacy box set or alone on DVD and VHS as well as on laserdisc). It expands on Ripley's maternal persona which makes Weaver's performance all the better.James Cameron came off making The Terminator and made Aliens. He used his expertise in the sci-fi genre and created an engrossing story that does not let up until the final reel of the film. For all the young folk out there that have not seen this film, watch it and see perfection in action movie making. A must see.",10,49,61,7 June 1999
Toy Story 2," Hmmmm.....
","What can I say about Toy Story 2?  It has a great story that both a child and an adult can tolerate, some great animation that surpasses what we saw in the first and a touching message that Disney brings to the platter so very well in every animated movie they bring to the silver screen.  Bottom line is this is just as good, if not better, than the the original.  The one aspect of the film that shines is the conveyed feeling of how a toy is not only 'a toy' but an entity that has been given life by its owner.  How much you love a toy is how much it will live.  Great stuff here.  Of course, Tim Allen and Tom Hanks are great. I'll stop talking about it so you can just go see it.  You'll have a great time.  Trust me.",10,0,1,25 November 1999
The Matrix," TRUE Science fiction........
",".........is what this movie is all about. It actually takes the time not only tell you about the world they have have created, but they also show it with great elaborate sets and amazing cg. The script was original and fresh. It was well cast; Keanu Reeves gave a good performance, but Fishburne steals the show. And Carrie-Anne Moss......whoa. Something that also shines is the choreography of the fight scenes. All the actors do their own fighting, and it looks great. This definitely makes up for Fishburne and Reeves' other sci-fi encounters(you know what they were). What is the matrix? You'll just to have to find out for yourself. A must see.",10,0,0,31 March 1999
