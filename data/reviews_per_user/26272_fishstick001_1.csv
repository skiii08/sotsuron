Walk the Line," Joaquin was the man for the part
","I was a big Johnny Cash fan growing up. Loved the movie, Joaquin was the man for the part. Maybe an Oscar? Reese Witherspoon was very good too, but not quite country enough. June Carter was COUNTRY. I was pleased to see the actors actually sing for themselves. I was very impressed with Joaquin's voice as compared to JC's. Some of the songs were off a little but better than lip-syncing. Reese also studied June's voice styles and movements really well. She was great. The movie moved at a good pace and didn't get bogged down anywhere. I would have liked to have seen another half hour of the movie show some of the great things that Johnny and June did for country music later in their lives. Really great movie!",9,0,2,27 November 2005
