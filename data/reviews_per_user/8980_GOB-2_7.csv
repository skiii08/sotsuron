The Blair Witch Project," Zzzzzzz.....
","I drove 45 minutes to the nearest theatre to my house opening night only to find the movie was sold out. I thaught that this movie MUST be good. I finally got in the second night (only because I got my ticket eary in the day). My friend and I joked about how we could sell the tickets for quite a profit to people who could not get in. I wish I would have. My heart did not race for one second throughout the entire movie. There were piles of rocks, sounds of sticks breaking, and some stick figures hanging from trees. The only time I was even remotely scared is when my gobstopper supply was running low. The rest of the time I was just pinching myself trying to stay awake during the 45 minutes of the three characters yelling at each other. I'd recommend saving your money and time rather than see this.",Null,0,0,15 September 1999
Citizen Kane," Incredible movie experience
","While I don't think that anyone can name the absolute greatest film ever made, this is definately in the top 3 (The Godfather is my personal favorite). Welles never wasted a shot. Every performance, camera angle, editing, everything is perfect. It really makes someone wonder how Welles did not win the 'Best Director' oscar in 1941. Directors today can only wish to achieve what Welles did. Truly a magnificent study in greed and corruption that no one should miss.",Null,1,1,26 September 1999
The Shining," Only above average
","I felt that I should comment on this film because I did not think it was all that great, while other reviewers seem to think it's the greatest and scariest movie ever made. Now don't get me wrong. I thought it was an ok movie and definitely worth a rental. However the film seems very amature. Kubrick does not build the story up very well before Jack starts going nuts. Also the film editing seemed half asked. I also did not find this to be a very scary film. Kubrick was definitely a skilled science fiction director, but horror does not seem to be his forte'. 6/10",6,0,3,16 September 1999
A Clockwork Orange," A masterpiece
","I've always been a fan of thought provoking movies. Needless to say I am a big fan of Kubrick's Clockwork Orange. It is a terrifying piece that seems all too real. I would not recommend it for the kids, but if you're looking for deep, thought provoking drama, this is it.",Null,0,0,2 September 1999
Pulp Fiction," Top o' the list
","I can't believe people told me this was a horrible movie. I spent quite some time avoiding it because of the negative feedback. Now that I've finally seen it, all I can say is WOW! This was a truly great movie. Great acting, great dialogue, and it is not as violent as some people make it out to be. Definitely a must see.",Null,1,2,16 September 1999
The Godfather: Part III," Not great or even necessary, but still pretty good
",I realise that many people don't like this film. It is probably due to them comparing it to the other two. This isn't really fair since the first two are two of the greatest movies in history. Taken by itself it really isn't that bad. I was glad to see how the Corleone family would continue after Michael died. And I also think the final shot of Michael on the chair was a very powerful shot. I saw Michael's life flash before my eyes at that moment.,Null,0,1,17 November 1999
The Godfather," Fantastic
","I have seen many many movies and this is simply one of the best. My 2nd favorite film of all time. If you havent seen this film, get up and go to your local blockbuster. Forget that, just go buy it since you'll want to view it many many times. Be sure to get The Godfather Part II while you're there.",10,1,2,2 September 1999
