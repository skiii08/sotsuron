The Ring," Cool
","After watching the original version Ringu i kinda knew what was going to happen.  i found that the film followed a similar pattern to ringu but was different - if you know what i mean, Although saying that i found this film very good and had me in a shiver near the end (maybe i'm a wimp).",8,4,7,13 February 2003
