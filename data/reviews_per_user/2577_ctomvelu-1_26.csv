Deja Vu," Solid first half
","I gave DEJA VU 7 stars because of a slam-bang, tension-filled first half. The second half detracts from the score, as the movie goes off in the wrong direction and comes to an implausible finish, even for a science fiction movie (and make no mistake, this is a science fiction flick). Washington stars as a cop investigating the bombing of a ferry that kills hundreds, including many servicemen. The mystery of the event deepens with the discovery of a woman's charred body miles downstream. A bunch of mad scientists working in a big, expensive lab show DW using their newly developed wayback machine a way to view the immediate past, in an effort to figure out the who and why and when of things leading up to the explosion. OK so far. But then, the movie shifts into time travel, and other than Jim Cavaziel popping up as the mad bomber, interest quickly wanes. Sort of like the second half of EVENT HORIZON, when Sam Neil becomes Pinhead. Not one of DW's best, for sure. You have to see him in his undies, curled up in a tiny box, being flung into the past via the mad scientists' wayback machine. I'd like to say, what was he thinking? But God only know how many millions he was paid for this semi-turkey. Plus, he apparently enjoys working with Tony Scott.",7,0,1,14 June 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Kiddie flick
","Not up to the first or even the second movie in the series, PIRATES AT WORLD'S END has Jack Sparrow's crew searching for their lost captain. You may recall Captain Jack was swallowed by a giant beast at the end of the second movie. He exists in a sort of Limbo at the beginning of this film. Eventually, all are reunited, and it's time to fight both Davy Jones and his ghostly crew as well as the British navy. Loads of CGI, with a computer rendering of Captain Jack standing in for the real thing in many of the action sequences. Of course, the kids won't mind, having been conditioned to this cartooniness by SPIDER-MAN flicks. Johnny Depp is funny as the seemingly endlessly inebriated Captain Jack, but the humor wears a bit thin this third time around. The ending may disappoint the adults. But again, the kiddies probably won't mind. Let's hope this is the end of the series.",6,0,0,21 May 2008
Spider-Man 3," Good sequel, with problems
","S-M 3 is a decent sequel, with Spidey (Tobey Maguire) facing no fewer than three super villains: Sandman (Thomas Church), Goblin Junior (James Franco) and Alien Spider-Man (Topher Grace). Spidey's love life, involving a plan to propose to Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), is complicated by the arrival of a new gal pal, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Howard). Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is still around, and in the film's most touching moment gives Peter her old engagement ring to give to MJ. Life at the paper goes on as well. As has been the case with the two previous films, the best moments are the quiet, non-costumed ones. The moment the costumes go on, the movie takes a jarring turn into computer-designed cartoons. And while these cartoon sequences are an improvement over those in the first movie, they're still just cartoons. I guess the kids don't care. Now for the real problems: Macguire is a one-note actor, so some of his most dramatic moments, like being spurned by MJ and when one of the main characters dies, are singularly unconvincing. Also, Dunst acts like she wishes she were anywhere but in yet another Spider-Man movie. And three villains, plus a running time of well over two hours, is just too, too much. Nevertheless, the film was put together by a master hand (Sam Raimi) who has guided the series from the beginning. So, unlike many of the sequels to films about Superman, X-Men, Batman and Robocop, which were often directed by others and frequently mishandled by their studios (you should read about the butchering of ROBOCOP 3), this second Spider-Man sequel lets us continue to have an interest in Peter Parker and his constant travails. I have no doubt a fourth film will happen, and frankly I wouldn't mind seeing Topher Grace replace Maguire. Grace out-acts Maguire at every turn here.",7,1,2,8 June 2008
Resident Evil: Extinction," Great sequel
","How many second sequels can you think of that hold up as well as the original or even the first sequel? RE: EXTINCTION does just that, thanks to a clever plot, fine performances from several seasoned actors plus some eye-popping special effects and set designs. A ragtag group of Raccoon City survivors is trying to find its way to a place of safety, and ends up crossing paths with Alice, who by now is so powerful she can actually control the elements. Meanwhile, the creeps back at the Umbrella Corp. are still after Alice, mainly for her blood. There are fights galore against an endless army of zombies, but the most amazing battle occurs between the survivors and thousands of zombie crows. For those old enough to remember Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, this confrontation plays out like that old classic on steroids. Oded Fehr from THE MUMMY movies and Ali Larter of the FINAL DESTINATION flicks are on hand as leaders of the caravan of survivors. Milla Jovovich is once again on hand as Alice, but there is reason to believe this will be her final performance in that role should yet another sequel get green-lighted. The end is a real kick in the head, by the way. The film has some awesomely gory moments and is not suitable for young children.",8,2,3,6 July 2008
Silent Hill," Haunting
","I wrote a pretty favorable review of this under another name when I saw it in the theater. Having now watched it several times on TV, I felt it worth popping in here with a followup review. Believe it or not, I think SH plays better on TV, where its hypnotic pacing and wonderfully bizarre sets can be appreciated at one's leisure, especially, if one has a DVR. I agree with the poster who says SH is not a horror film but a nightmare piece. That is exactly what it is, and in that way, it works quite well. Rhada Mitchell is a convincingly distraught mother searching for her lost child, and she reminds me a good deal of Naomi Watts' similarly distraught character in the American remake of THE RING. No harm in that. The fiery climax with the devil worshipers or whatever the hell they are supposed to be is on the awesomely stupid side, and it is nothing we haven't seen before, except maybe for that barbed wire running itself up into Alice Krige's pooky and then ripping her apart. The devil kid is also pretty spooky. The very ending, with Mitchell and the daughter at home but in another dimension from the husband, is haunting in the truest sense of the word. A great ending to a pretty good, but not great, film.",7,0,1,15 October 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tricky
","This is strictly Tim Burton's take on the stage musical 'Sweeney Todd.' As such, it is almost surrealistic in its retelling of the legend of the Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Johnny Depp as Todd has returned to London after 15 years away, having been shanghaied so that the local judge (Alan Rickman) can have his way with Todd's comely young wife. Todd keeps to the shadows as he plots his revenge, with the aid of a pie maker, Mrs. Lovett (Helena Carter), who remembers and adores him. The two are soon turning into meat pies all who enter Sweeney's chair, as Todd broods on how to get his razor around the judge's throat. The songs are imaginatively staged and sung, and Depp is as usual completely immersed in his character. He's a razor-wielding, hollow-eyed maniac with a mission. The throat cuttings are plentiful and shown in extreme closeup. The bodies then fall head-first with a sickening thud onto the cellar floor three stories below. This is more intense and realistic violence than Burton exhibited in SLEEPY HOLLOW, so those of weak constitutions beware. And definitely keep the kiddies away!",7,0,0,29 November 2008
We Are Marshall," OK football movie
","A plane crash kills many of the football players and others from Marshall University in WE ARE MARSHALL. New coach Matthew Mc, attempts to create a new team that will keep the spirit of the old team alive. Based on a a true story, this sports movie presents some realistic football action. Matthew Fox from LOST is the secondary coach who feels he should have died in that crash. It pays to be a jock to watch this one, but it isn't 100 percent necessary. Rooting for the underdog is what the film is really about, and as such, it is a favorite American pastime. As far as the characters go, I found MM oddly disconnected from the story. Fox, however, gives a great performance.",6,2,3,19 January 2009
Gone Baby Gone," Depressing crime thriller
","In GONE BABY GONE, director Ben Affleck does a bang-up job with a difficult novel adaptation. If you spot similarities to MYSTIC RIVER, it's because the author (Dennis Lehane) is the same and the setting is almost identical. In South Boston, a little girl goes missing and a private eye (Casey Affleck) is called in by her aunt (Amy Madigan). Affleck and his partner/lover (Sandra Bullock lookalike Michelle Monaghan) are more used to tracing skips, but he decides to take the case against his partner's advice. In the middle of the case, another child is snatched and a known child rapist appears to be the culprit. But did he also snatch the first child? Before the movie is over, almost everyone involved will be damaged or dead and have their lives turned upside down. Casey Affleck, a surprising choice for the lead much in the way Owen Wilson was for ENEMY DOWN, is supported by veteran actors Morgan Freeman as the police captain and Ed Harris and John Ashton as a pair of grizzled police detectives. This movie is not for the faint of heart. It is bloody, extremely vulgar and comes to a very disturbing end that many are likely to find unsatisfying -- much like the ending of MYSTIC RIVER. That's Lehane for ya, and Ben Affleck at least had the courage to end the movie the way the book ended. For the guys, there is a hell of a scary, ultra-realistic shootout in the second half. The rest of the film is mostly talk, although interest never flags.",7,2,3,3 August 2008
The Thing," An unrivaled masterpiece
","This 1982 remake of THE THING gets my top rating, and few films do. I was awestruck by it from my very first viewing and continue to watch it at least once a year for good measure. An ambitious rehash of Howard Hawks' 1952 THE THING and clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 ALIEN, JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING roughly follows the plot of the original: An alien life form that can imitate anything it desires kills and absorbs humans and other animals left and right. If let loose on the world, it will soon be the only living thing on the planet. A bunch of American scientists and their support team working at an Antarctioc base try to contain the beast, with little success. Hawks made his creature a close copy of Universal's Frankenstein monster, while Carpenter opts to have his Thing morph into all sorts of things, including a sled dog, various people and occasionally a snarling pile of absolutely disgusting ooze and flesh. There's even a funny if stomach-turning moment when the creature is an upside-down head running around on tiny feet. I wouldn't have been surprised if one of the men had said, 'Now there's something you don't see everyday.' It's a fight to the finish, with a very ambiguous ending. The incredible special effects have never been surpassed. The cast is superb, and includes a very hairy Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Keith David and Richard Dysart. Plus some wonderfully trained dogs, with an astounding opening sequence involving a suspenseful chase across a snowy landscape. The film was shot in Canada, for the record. While each character is nicely defined, Russell is definitely the tie that binds, the John Wayne-type hero facing down the black-hat villain. Several sequences pay fond tribute to Hawks' original. I like that as well. See it. But definitely not at meal time.",9,1,2,27 October 2008
Little Miss Sunshine," A road trip not worth taking
","Family road trip movie revolving around a children's beauty pageant is rated R, so it will not be to everyone's taste. Decent cast -- Greg Kinnear is the dad and and Alan Arkin is the granddad == but few laughs and frankly, I felt everyone tried much too hard. Toni Coillette as the mom is just plain annoying. SUNSHINE is clearly an indie, so it will appeal largely to that mindset, and not the mainstream audience. And again, it is an R, even after it is cleaned up for TV. The finale is bizarre, to say the least, and doesn't come off the way I suspect the directors intended. It is, frankly, embarrassing. After awhile, you kind of wish the dilapidated vehicle the family is riding in from their home in Albuquerque to the pageant in Redondo Beach would blow up. With them in it.",4,0,5,20 June 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Tacky sequel
","John Connor is now an adult, and this time around is played by an actor (Nick Stah) who bears not the slightest resemblance to the John Connor of the second film. Mama Connor is nowhere to be found, as actress Linda Hamilton did not appear in the film for one reason or another -- not that it really matters. Connor quickly crosses paths with an old classmate (Claire Danes, of all people) and soon enough they are running from a female Terminator (Kris Loken). A much smaller and older Arnold is back as yet another T-101 trying to save the young pair. The plot from this point is a virtual carbon copy of the second movie, only with louder explosions and longer chases. You can feel the script forcing and stretching this improbable scenario, especially since the whole Skylab issue was resolved at the end of T2. Director Mostow substitutes CGI-heavy action and chase sequences for any sense of forward plotting. T3 is strictly from hunger. Arnold is simply awful and has no presence. Loken is a joke as a 'superior' cyborg, not half as effective as Robert Patrick's shape-shifting machine in T2. Stahl and Danes do what little they can with this ramshackle story. The ending is bizarre and unsatisfying, to say the least. There is one chase sequence involving some rather large vehicles that, at least on TV, should keep the viewer awake for a bit. In the theater, this same sequence had so much CGI in it that I thought I was watching a badly made cartoon. If you catch this on regular TV, you have nothing to lose -- but it would be better if you know nothing about the first two movies. T3 throws away all sense of logic and character development.",6,0,0,2 September 2008
Apocalypse Now," A masterpiece
","My youngest daughter met Martin Sheen today, which prompted me to file this review of one of Hollywood's greatest movies. Based on Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, APOCALYPSE NOW follows Army captain Martin Sheen into the jungles of Southeast Asia as he searches for renegade colonel Marlon Brando, who has gone native and frankly stark raving mad. Sheen gets far more than he bargained for when he finally finds Brando. Along the way, Sheen encounters a real cowboy of a lieutenant colonel played by a young Robert Duvall, who utters the film's classic line, 'How I love the smell of napalm in the morning.' Sheen had a heart attack while filming this massive epic in the Philippines. Frederic Forrest, a great character actor perhaps best known as the crazy military goods store owner in FALLING DOWN, has a plum role as the doomed 'Chef.' The film is absolutely amazing and can never be duplicated or equaled. Brando was in his glory as a larger-than-life madman, and Sheen justifiably became one of Hollywood's biggest stars after this. A must-see, especially for those of you who, like my kid, only know Sheen from THE DEPARTED.",8,0,1,10 June 2008
Enchanted," Sleeping Beauty Meets Snow White Meets Cinderella
","In this fish-out-of-water Disney comedy, a cartoon princess (Amy Adams) residing in a bucolic fantasy world is sent to modern-day New York by her evil future mother-in-law, played in delightfully wicked fashion by Susan Sarandon. The princess's fiancé, Prince Edward (James Marsden) leaps into our world to rescue her. Meanwile, the princess, now flesh and blood and thoroughly lost in Manhattan, is taken in by a starchy but compassionate divorce lawyer (Pat Dempsey) who is himself divorced with a small daughter. Pretty soon, the evil queen also hits the bricks in hot pursuit of the princess. You can guess the rest. The film begins with a gorgeously animated segment that perfectly imitates the angular style of Disney's 1956 SLEEPING BEAUTY. The live action segment, which takes up most of the rest of this expensive production, never quite achieves the excitement and humor of the cartoon, and viewers are likely to get restless long before the conclusion. There are some intentionally sappy songs and a big dance number in Central Park, and I have to say the special effects throughout were top notch. While Adams as the live-action princess is no raving beauty, she brings a huge amount of energy and a sense of fun to her slightly daffy character. Disney made a very smart move in hiring a competent actress rather than a simple looker for the lead role. Another nice touch: the legendary Julie Andrews narrates. I gave the movie a fairly high rating mainly for that opening animated sequence and Adams' wonderful, wide-eyed NF.",7,0,0,17 August 2008
The Mist," Taut suspense most of the way
","Giant insects and sundry other creatures, some of them entirely new species, pop up in an unnatural fog that settles over a small Maine town, and all hell breaks loose. A group of people are trapped in a grocery store when the fog overtakes the town, and some but not all of them do their best to survive. It doesn't work out too well for anybody. Lots of gory effects, some of it startling and vivid and some of it simply laughable. Pretty decent CGI on the majority of the creatures. The plot is a cousin to THE FOG, minus the pirates and hidden gold. A reasonable time killer with a downer of an ending, so beware. A stone-faced Tom Jane stars, and is surrounded by some familiar faces, including Jeff DeMunn and Marcia Gay Harden, who as a Bibe-spouting hag decides the fog represents the end of the world, and requires human sacrifice. As if the terrified folks in the store don't have enough to worry about.",7,1,3,5 April 2009
Shrek the Third," Get off the throne, already
","A very tired Shrek (Mike Myers) tries to recruit a kid Artie (Justin Timberlake) to replace the recently deceased king (John Cleese) so that Shrek does not have to assume the throne. Prince Charming (Rupert Everet) meanwhile decides to install himself as the new king, and imprisons all who defy him, including Fiona (Cameron Diaz), her mother (Julie Andrews) plus Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow White, Rapunzel, Pinocchio, 3 Blind Mice, 3 Little Pigs and the Gingerbread Man. Charming also eventually imprisons Shrek and plans to kill him on stage before a live audience. Will Artie save the day? Or will Shrek get the ax? Who cares? The jokes are as tired as Shrek. Not even Puss (Antonio Banderas) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) can save this unnecessary, plodding sequel. There is one funny bit involving walking, talking trees that are straight out of THE WIZARD OF OZ, but that's about it. And I will admit Shreks's offspring, seen at the end, are adorable -- but of course. SHREK 3 is for small children and Shrek fans only.",6,1,2,30 November 2008
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Kiddie fantasy
","Unlike X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN, FF 1 and FF2 are clearly aimed at a younger audience, and that's not completely a bad thing. This time around, the quartet of superheroes faces a planet-busting force, led by the one and only Silver Surfer. They chase the silver guy around the globe but have a tough time dealing with him An old foe, Doc Doom, is back from the first movie to screw things up. The action, all of it apparently CGI, is not always easy to follow or believe. Attempts at humor, which worked well in the comic pages, fall flat on screen, The gal playing Sue Storm is simply not up to the task, and should be replaced in any further sequels. The Silver Surfer himself appears to be purely CGI, or possibly motion-capture. Either way, this is not the Silver Surfer of the comic pages. The movie plods along from one set piece to the next. Young children will probably be kept amused by the very orange Ben Grimm.",6,2,4,29 November 2008
Event Horizon," It will grow on you
","Like BLADE RUNNER and THE THING, EVENT HORIZON will grow on you with repeated viewings. It is impossible to absorb every little detail that occurs in this sci-fi horror classic based on a single viewing. Sam Neil and Larry Fishburne head out to take a look at a manned spacecraft that disappeared years before and has suddenly reappeared in space. Everyone on board is dead and the ship appears to be possessed (whichit is). The body count among the rescue crew quickly begins to mount. The movie is basically a haunted house in space, and it can be scary as hell. It also can get pretty silly, as it does in the second half when it borrows a little too liberally from HELLRAISER. Director Paul (RESIDENT EVIL) Anderson does a terrific job with the massive sets and eerie lighting and quirky characters, but the script ultimately fails him. Best bet: watch it once all the way through, then watch only the first half on second viewing. If you insist on watching the whole thing a second time, from the point at which medical technician Kathleen Qunilan meets her grisly fate, keep one eye closed for the rest of the film. But man oh man, that first half is a real humdinger.",7,0,1,9 November 2008
Black Snake Moan," Moan indeed
","Anyone who paid good money to see BLACK SNAKE MOAN in a theater must have wished they could find a coral snake and end it right then and there. A balding, bearded Sam Jackson plays a poor southern black who chains the town's nymphet (Christina Ricci) in his home in an attempt to keep her away from the bad boys, who have treated her roughly. Meanwhile, her beau (Justin Timberlake, of all people) is returning from the service, which leads to a showdown with Jackson. I thought Timberlake likes boys. Oops, tell me I didn't just say that out loud. I did. Anyhow, Jackson strums an old guitar and sings badly, Ricci strums his guitar and sings even worse, Timberlake flourishes a pistol and then breaks down and cries ... and, well you get the idea. Ricci spends some of the movie in panties and a ripped t-shirt, but she is anything but erotic. Jackson buys her a dress and takes her to a blues bar, where he performs while she dances sort of like Elaine on SEINFELD. She also spends most of the movie sporting a black eye and other assorted and distinctly unpleasant bruises. BSM is for those who like their movies in the mode of TOBACCO ROAD.",4,7,16,7 June 2008
Taken," Old plot new tricks
","You've seen the plot of TAKEN before: A former CIA operative's daughter is kidnapped and is to be sold into a life of slavery and prostitution. He immediately goes after the kidnapers. The action takes us from Los Angeles to Paris and back. Liam Neeson is the operative and Famke Janssen is the ex-wife; otherwise, the cast is largely made up of an army of stuntmen, all on hand to be mowed down by Neeson in his quest to retrieve his daughter. What makes the movie work are the incredible fight sequences, which are plentiful and modeled on the fight sequences in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. Since the movie is rated PG-13, there is no blood to speak of, but the violence feels real enough and Neeson is believable as a killing machine who cannot be stopped or even slowed down. No surprises plot-wise, and the story is told in strictly linear form, but wow, those fight scenes. A French film written by Luc Besson. Movie buffs may be reminded of TARGET with Gene Hackman and FRANTIC with Harrison Ford.",8,2,4,7 February 2009
Groundhog Day," Deja vu all over again
","GROUNDHOG DAY is a masterpiece that has been often imitated, but never equaled. Bill Murray in his prime plays a cocky and horribly bored weatherman who travels to the tiny town of Punxsatawney, Pa., for Groundhog Day and finds himself stuck there on the same day over and over again. At first, he makes a game of it, then he tries killing himself, and finally comes around to realizing he's been given a second chance. You've seen the plot before, but never so well done. Andie MacDowell, also in her prime, costars as Murray's love interest. The writer (Dan Rubin) and director (longtime Murray cohort and GHOSTBUSTERS costar Harold Ramis) really outdo themselves with this clever film. This is the first film I have ever given a 10 to. It is well-deserved.",10,7,12,22 March 2009
A Beautiful Mind," A twisted mind
","Russell Crowe (aka Fathead) stars as a mathematician suffering from paranoid schizophrenia; As this is very loosely based on a real person, we follow the character through school, into the world of teaching and government cryptography, marriage, sinking into madness and then slowly climbing out. It is primarily set in the Cold War era. I have never been a Russell Crowe fan, so you should read elsewhere for impressions of his performance. Personally, I quickly tired of his mumbling. Also, I am not fond of very long movies, and this is a very long movie. Director Howard has a few surprises in store that will engage the minds of 12 year old viewers everywhere. Jen Connelley is the nutty professor's wife, and Ed Harris plays a shadowy government figure.",7,0,2,28 March 2009
Wedding Crashers," OK if highly predictable romantic comedy
","Owen Wislon and Vince Vaughn, who is an acquired taste, star as 'The Wedding Crashers.' When they aren't working, they crash weddings, intent on eating, drinking and having one-night stands. Simple as that. The predictable plot has Wilson falling hard for a gal (Rachel McAdams of 'The Notebook' ) at one of the weddings they crash. Unfortunately, she has a serious boyfriend who beats up on Wilson. But Wilson will not be deterred, much to the dismay of Vaughn, who crashes weddings strictly for the reasons cited above and nothing more. Christopher Walken plays the father of McAdams, and he seems out of his element in what is essentially the DeNiro role from 'Meet the Parents.' Vaughn is as usual too much and should be taken outside and shot. Come to think of it, that's exactly what happens to him here. Wilson is funny and endearing as a lovelorn sap who fears he may never win his true love. McAdams, sporting very dark hair, is sweet and affecting as his true love. Her character would have been played by someone like Cameron Diaz 10 years ago. Come to think of it, Diaz did play the same type of role, in 1997's 'My Best Friend's Wedding.' The ending is exactly what you are thinking it is as you read this. The movie holds few surprises, but it makes an OK time killer. Truth be told, 'My Best Friend's Wedding' is a better bet.",6,0,0,28 June 2008
Man on Fire," Definitely on fire
","Denzel Washington takes on a Bruce Willis role in MAN ON FIRE and does a great job. He plays a burned-out operative who agrees to guard the daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a wealthy family living in Mexico. Not surprisingly, she ends up kidnapped, he is nearly killed, and it quickly becomes apparent he was hired to be the dupe. Instead of returning to the states, he goes after the kidnappers. The rest of the film is pure action and nasty revenge, as he has been told the girl is dead. A great vehicle for Washington, wonderfully written and directed, but with some rather oddball artsy photography that detracts (see it and decide for yourself). Christopher Walken plays an old agency buddy, and Giancarlo G. is an investigator. One of Washington's best and unfortunately rarely seen on TV.",8,0,0,14 February 2009
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Action romp
","John McTiernan returned for the third installment, Jon Hensleigh did a bang-up screenplay and Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson make a wonderfully hysterical odd couple in a movie that never stops to take a breath. Not once. The Germans are back, this time with a plan to steal gold from the Federal Reserve on New York. To accomplish this, they lead McClane and the NYPD on a merry chase around Manhattan as various things are blown up, including a subway car (created using a spectacular physical special effect, much studied over the years and later turned into a 'ride' at Universal Studios). McClane and his newfound buddy, a Harlem store owner not fond of whites, survive innumerable obstacles to finally track down the bad guys, led by the brother of the main bad guy McClane killed in DIE HARD. Jeremy Irons goes slumming as the baddie here. The movie is full of impossible heroics, but who cares? Wisely, Hensleigh and McTiernan chose to treat the god-awful DIE HARD 2 as if it never existed and directly linked DH3 to DH. The one false note is the total absence of Mrs. McClane. Bonnie Bedelia at the very least deserved a cameo. There are several shots of the World Trade Ceter towers, which hurts the heart today. Otherwise, McTiernan makes great use of NYC locations, including an eye-popping, heart-stopping, running gun battle along the Saw Mill Parkway. And there's just enough humor to keep things from getting too grim and completely out of hand. Watching Bruce Willis get knocked around by a flood in a water tunnel is the film's highlight. By the by, I have often wondered if the German language version of the movie turned the bad guys into Frenchies or Brits.",7,0,0,1 February 2009
Beowulf," Pretty awful
","I realize I am way too old for this type of cartoon movie (I'm 58) and steered clear of it upon its theatrical release, partly due to the dismal reviews. My 30-something nephew insisted I watch it with him on his gigantic HDTV in Blu-Ray format, so i did. For the most part. l was zoned out before it was over. so he pulled it and put in IRON MAN, which eventually had me running for home as that definitely was not Tony Stark up on the big screen. Back to BEOWULF: the story is one of our earliest hero legends, about a warrior who slays a great monster, named Grendel. This cartoon movie loosely follows that story. It is difficult to watch, in a way very similar to POLAR EXPRESS, and was at this moment I should have realized it was a Robert Zemeckis flick. Robert, when will you stop screwing around with the imagery in your movies and just tell a decent story? For an adult, unless that adult is of a juvenile mindset, the film will be virtually unwatchable. It's all motion capture and green screen. I thought the hero should at least have been played by Sean Bean. This Beowulf looks remarkably like Bean but doesn't sound like him, as 'it' was actually played by the guy who played Golum. There's plenty of gore and blood, which I always appreciate, but even that was way too cartoonish. For simple minds only.",4,1,2,29 October 2008
Fantastic Four," Kids' movie
","Aimed strictly at the kiddie set, FF tells how four astronauts are molecularly altered by cosmic rays, resulting in such powers as the ability to stretch (Reed Richards), turn invisible and manipulate the very air (Invisible Girl), become a flaming, flying freak (Human Torch) and grow orange rhino skin and be able to move mountains (Thing). This first movie spends time developing each character as he or she starts to adjust to the new powers. They also take on Doctor Doom, a metallic-masked villain who can do some really nasty stuff with the flick of a wrist, like boring a hole through the middle of someone. Most of the FF's off time is spent kibitzing with each other. The humor is broad and aimed squarely at the pre-teen crowd, the exact opposite of X-MEN and SPIDER-MAN. The movie is clunky at best and could have used more action. And the gal playing Invisible Girl seemed oddly cast to me. I would have preferred a more polished actress like Rachael McAdams or even Kirtsen Dunst. But then again, they didn't make this movie for an adult male with three grown children. Maybe the kiddies loved her in this role.",6,0,1,1 December 2008
