Black Swan," Oh why o why??
","Apologies for the bad review, I can't even seem to make the effort to write about this film.Such a freaking waste of a good idea. I don't know where to start. This is the sort of movie you know it'll be irretrievably bad after you've passed the first 10 minutes. God, I hate that feeling. I'm actually very very angry that such an interesting and unusual plot idea has been butchered the way it's been. It's bland, badly written, full of awful clich√©s at every level and about every 2 minutes. And the camera moves are nauseous.Flat, unemotional, linear, unconvincing, so annoyingly predictable. I'm embarrassed for Vincent Cassel. How did he ever end up in such a mess of a film? I'm no prude at all, but the sex is so obviously gratuitous (and badly directed, think either Charmed, Buffy or Angel) that it made me cringe. Why bother at all in this case, just stick doing TV shows! I'm no ballet expert but for the little knowledge I have of this Art I sense every actual ballet dancer will find this appalling. They even managed to make the music sound bad. Tchaikovsky butchered too!! Waste, waste and more waste. I wish this film could be wiped off from the surface of the planet and be done again. The only redeemable thing is the excellent work of the costume designer.Another case of Emperor's new clothes even if I do respect other people's opinions, I truly believe this is one of the worst films ever made that leaves you with a bitter frustration thinking of what it could have been. :(",1,29,58,1 February 2011
Control," Beautiful
","I remember how overwhelmed I felt when the scene on the first TV appearance starts with 'Transmission'. It felt so surreal. I loved that movie because somehow it forces you to do your part and pay attention to what is not said or obvious. Yes Ian Curtis's life is dull and uninteresting if you approach it with a cold eye. But what can anyone expect with a life well...so short? Like many incredible talents he was about to blossom, this was just the beginning of something much more bigger and intense. It was raw energy.I completely had empathy for this young man marrying at 19 getting stuck in a marriage-mortgage-9 to 5 job hell when obviously he was meant for something different. Paying the consequences for a decision taken too young, and being propelled to fame so quickly unable to cope with the pressure and energy that it takes when it was obvious he'd never make it very far. I hope the people who will watch the film will remember this and the context of the 70's. I think Corbijn did a fine job at portraying the desperate situation Ian Curtis was in, doubled with illness and depression. Sam Riley is incredibly convincing at portraying these feelings, the guilt, the doubts, the inevitable spiral where Ian Curtis was doomed to fall. The choice of shooting the film in B&W was of course intentional and as Corbijn said, I too cannot think of the film being shot in colour. It perfectly renders the darkness and sober atmosphere of JD's world. The film is full of strong contrasts which completely defines what JD's music feels to me: Energetic Depressive",9,2,2,22 August 2008
Titanic," Loses its charm after a while
","I remember being of the anti-titanic bunch when the film was released. Would I have to go and see the movie at a theatre it was simply impossible. Theatres were full at each session even if the movie was on heavy rotation all over Paris (France). One day I just thought to myself that it couldn't be THAT bad if so many people after so many months were still going to watch it if not re-watch it or even re-re-re-watch it! I gave in one day and I can assure you that the theatre was still full. I must say I really liked it the first time. Like in the old times, big fat sumptuous cinema! Now having seen it several times on a format that should be excommunicated (TV), I found a lot of annoying if not irritating things in it. I still like the film globally but there are real spoilers. First once someone made you aware that some parts of the movie have been made using a computer, you can't help spotting them and thinking that navy crew in the background at the beginning of the film have a funny way of walking a bit like playdoh men. Other stuff bothered me a lot eg Rose doing a 'finger' when they take the lift to go to a lower level of the boat. Was it necessary? Is it plausible at such a time in the history? It kinda makes you think 'oh man they can't be serious!'.",6,2,4,11 December 2005
