Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 is as good a sequel as I've seen
","When I first caught news of Ridley Scott's intention to reboot Blade Runner, I was skeptical to say the least. Blade Runner is after all a timeless science fiction masterpiece unlike any Hollywood has ever conceived since its release in 1982. Also take into consideration Scott's recent Alien reboot misfires (Prometheus and Covenant) which only tarnished the franchise from my perspective. All of my fears dissipated the moment I heard that Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario, Prisoners) would be at the helm for Blade Runner 2049. In just four short years, Villeneuve has risen from obscurity into one of the top directors in Hollywood today. Villeneuve's attention to detail and his ability to unravel cerebral narratives with often minimal dialogue puts him in a unique class of directors that include Christopher Nolan and David Fincher. In addition to Villeneuve, cinematographer Roger Deakins (Sicario, Prisoners, No Country For Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption) and film scorer Hans Zimmer (Batman: The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar) were crucial additions to the Blade Runner 2049 team and are at the heart of the film's astounding beauty.I was incredibly curious how they would depict the future, in this case Los Angeles in 2049. Though the dystopian look and feel is every bit as effective of the original, what elevated Blade Runner 2049 was the additional depth captured as Gosling's character travels outside of the city to San Diego and Las Vegas where the climate and terrain is much more reminiscent of Mad Max (desert, industrial waste, post-apocalyptic, etc.). To me this really tells the complete story of a world ravaged by climate change and radiation, which has left the planet barren of all plant life. Like many of the better science fiction films, Blade Runner 2049 is a cautionary tale that speaks to the imminent environmental disaster that awaits humans as our leaders stand idly by. My hope is this message isn't drowned-out by the allure of the hyper- sexualized/hedonistic digital AI culture that has become one of the few means people have to connect in a society void of any real emotional or physical release. It is meant to be a distraction both in life and in this story, which I don't think everyone is going to understand or appreciate. To that end; anyone calling out the film as being misogynistic, I think it's important to acknowledge the evolution of both the entertainment industry and the internet through pornography and what that trajectory might look like in a city like Los Angeles 32 years from now as we continue to develop artificial intelligence and robotics. To change that narrative would be to lie about the current state of affairs in relation to climate change and technology. At a time when we're standing on the edge of disaster, it's imperative that we take a long, hard look at what kind of world we'll be leaving for generations to come. Like it's predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 pulls no punches.In terms of the performances, I can't think of a contemporary film that did as good a job with casting as Blade Runner 2049. Harrison Ford and Robin Wright in particular are extraordinary and both deserve to be in the conversation come Oscar season. Ryan Gosling was fantastic as well, but due to the stoic nature of his character I don't think had to push himself quite as far.Though I've heard some rumblings of the runtime being a bit too long (2 hours a 43 minutes) I have to say the movie seemed much shorter to me. Like all Villeneuve films, the pacing requires some patience and there's a great deal of texture to each scene. If you're not a fan of this style of direction/storytelling, Blade Runner 2049 might be a bit tedious. Personally, I go to the movies to be transported and ideally feel some sort of emotional response. In the case of Blade Runner 2049 both metrics were off the charts for me (A+). I would recommend seeing the film in 2D (3D seems like it would be overwhelming and unnecessary) and if available, in IMAX. The cinematography, sound design and score are unparalleled and though the script isn't perfect, Blade Runner 2049 is a remarkable film worthy of the name. Like most films of this caliber, I intend on seeing it at least once more in the theater before really gauging its effect, but for now let's just say I can't think of a more complete and provocative science fiction film to come out in the new millennium.",9,2,6,9 October 2017
The Babadook," Refreshing perspective on the horror genre
","Major kudos to Aussie director Jennifer Kent, who managed to distill down all the pain and loneliness of being a working-class single mother, into one of the most frightening ghost stories I've seen. The Babadook represents everything good horror can and should be, with plenty of heart, humor and social commentary for good measure. Here's to female directors willing to explore issues all too often ignored in film.",7,0,0,30 July 2018
The Revenant," 'The Revenant' truly nails the battle between man and nature in what I believe will be one of the most studied films of the 21st century.
","Though the acting is undoubtedly some of the best I've seen from Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy (two of the finest actors alive today) the true stars of the film are its visionary cinematographer (Emmanuel Lubezki) and director (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu), who between 'Birdman' (my favorite film of 2014) and 'The Revenant' have just rewritten the book on their perspective talents. I kept thinking to myself, 'this looks like a Terrance Malick film', which has everything to do with Lubezki's work with Malick on the acclaimed 'The Tree of Life' and the grossly overlooked 'The New World', which remains my favorite historical love story to date. A warning to those squeamish towards violence, 'The Revenant' is brutal; placing the audience in the heart of the battle to the point where you can smell the death and decay. By contrast, I've never seen more breathtaking panoramic shots of nature on the silver screen. 'The Revenant' truly nails the battle between man and nature in what I believe will be one of the most studied films of the 21st century.",8,0,2,23 February 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," This is my favorite film
","It's a romantic comedy...it's science fiction...it's an existential drama...it's funny...it's sad...it's thought provoking...it's infantile...it stars a comedian playing a boring, depressed, lovesick underachiever...it's my favorite film and it's not even close. Here's to films that break all of the rules of convention and work beautifully.",10,0,0,4 August 2018
Mother!," Not for the faint of heart, Mother! is a visceral experience and story that needed to be told
","Not since his 2006 opus The Fountain has Darren Aronofsky unleashed a film as polarizing as Mother. A pretentious melange of religion, misogamy, paranoia, fear and death of all that is pure and innocent, Mother! is as unrelenting as Aronofsky's acclaimed break out film Requiem for a Dream (2000).Largely marketed as horror film, beneath the surface Mother! is an allegorical tale where a writer/poet (Bardem) creatively struggles to find his muse, while his wife (Lawrence) works tireless to rebuild their home, which was mysteriously destroyed in a fire. As the story unfolds various Old Testament Biblical figures begin to visit the writer (God) to express their devotion and adoration (i.e. Adam, Eve, Cane, Able, etc.). Each of these visitors is riddled with flaws as they attempt to atone for their sins. In the process, they destroy God's most cherished possession and much of their home (earth) which the Mother has been desperately protecting. In a fit of rage she expels these visitors, much to the chagrin of God (end Old Testament).Entering into the New Testament of Biblical allegories, Mother convinces God to conceive a child. God reverts to an even more narcissistic state as devoted followers begin storming their home once again. I won't go into the details, but lets just say the bulk of the negative reviews stem from Aronosky's portrayal of a world gone mad as these zealots attempt to control through fear, murder, rape and utter carnage. As a result, the Mother's home (earth) turns into a war zone.Anyone raised either Christian or Jewish should easily pick up on the themes in Mother! What I found poignant was Aronofsky's personification of a patriarchal, theistic society ruled by a narcissistic God who would time-and-time again sacrifice his own wife, mother, child and home (earth) to be worshiped. These same patriarchal themes occur in nearly all organized religions, and are the basis of most political systems today. Knowing the writer/director is an outspoken environmentalist, I can certainly understand the not-so-subtle message here.Due to the visceral response it has received -grade F on CinemaScore- I can't in good conscious recommend Mother! What I can say is that the performances by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem are Oscar-worthy. In addition, I felt the combination of direction, cinematography, editing and sound design created a surrealist nightmare of a world that at times induced genuine nausea. As someone who doesn't shy away from disturbing films of this nature, Mother! is as impactful a movie as I've experienced all year. I sincerely hope that the abrasive nature of the film doesn't overshadow the urgency of the themes conveyed here. Considering the film was largely marketed to mainstream audiences as a horror film starring A-list actors, I suspect some of negative reaction by the general public shows a lack of comprehension and/or a genuine distaste for film's complete lack of resolution.",8,2,7,19 September 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Jojo Rabbit is a miraculous achievement; an anti-war satire for the ages
","Jojo Rabbit is a miraculous film that does the near impossible. It's far and away my favorite film of 2019, and in my top 25 all-time. I don't want to spoil it, but if you're open to a poignant, beautifully crafted, anti-war, WWII period satire...look no further. For those questioning how all of these elements work together, please research the work of Mel Brooks, Charlie Chaplin, Stanley Kubrick and Roberto Benigni. Taika Waititi is following in a long tradition of making anti-war films that offer a range of emotion and depth. A+",10,2,8,18 November 2019
Green Book," Mortensen and Ali are transcendent
","Occasionally a film comes along where the acting is so extraordinary that I can overlook its flaws. Much like Malek's brilliant portrayal of Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody -which I'd say is an average film overall- Mortensen and Ali are transcendent as Tony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley. I'm admittedly a fan of both actors' work, but Green Book is in my opinion their crowning achievement and they both deserve Oscars.",9,7,13,31 December 2018
