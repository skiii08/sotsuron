Blade Runner 2049," I can't say enough horrible things about this movie!
","This movie was impossibly slow moving, entirely too long at 2h 40m, and completely devoid of anything that even approached interesting. The only 'good' parts of this movie were the exposed female body parts which you can see for free on any of a million free porn sites in a matter of seconds instead of wasting more than 2 1/2 hours of your life that you will never get back.Total garbage!",1,5,9,28 February 2019
