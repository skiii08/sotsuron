The Ring," Horrible!
","This movie sucked sooo bad!  I can't think of anything that was worse than this movie...I would rather watch the Adventures of Pluto Nash for 24 straight days than watch this movie one more time!  Horrible plot, bad acting, and on top of that it was just plain boring!  Don't waste your money or time...you'll be so mad that you wish you had watched the video in the Ring!",Null,0,1,6 March 2003
