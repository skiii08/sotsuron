E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," When Dumber Films Are Made...
","This is the most intellectually offensive big-budget science fiction movie I've ever seen. I write science fiction for a living (check the bookstores), and if I ever tried to get away with this kind of drivel, I'd be out of work. Example: E.T. can levitate -- but if he levitates to reach his ship at the start of the movie we have no movie, so he only seems able to levitate after he's been left behind. Example: The mother walks through a kitchen strewn with empty beer cans and doesn't notice them. What mother of a teen-aged kid (or younger) would do that? Example: E.T. dies for no known reason, and then comes back to life, also for no reason. The film is so filled with plot holes and logical flaws, and is so emotionally manipulative, that Spielberg hasn't yet finished paying his penance, even with SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.",Null,9,17,2 June 1999
L.A. Confidential," The best film of the 90s
","Top to bottom -- acting, writing, directing, cinematography, sound -- this is simply the best film of the 1990s. That it could lose any award other than maybe Best Shipwreck to TITANIC is a travesty that will take years for thoughtful moviegoers to forgive.",Null,0,0,2 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Turkey
","The first two films were fine, mindless summer fun with great special effects. This one is a turkey from start to finish. The audience may forgive Darth Vader for killing all those trillions of people because he's Luke's father -- but who is going to forgive the scriptwriter?",Null,1,2,2 June 1999
Duck Soup," The very best Marx Brothers film
","This is the best of the Marx Brothers films, done just Irving Thalberg brought them to MGM and emasculated them, turning them from carefree anarchists into the hero's sidekicks. If they are to be remembered for just one film, it should be DUCK SOUP.",Null,0,0,2 June 1999
The Dirty Dozen," Very good adventure film
","Very good adventure film, not quite up to the quality of THE GREAT ESCAPE or THE GUNS OF NAVARONE, but well above average. John Cassavetes steals the acting honors, as indeed he usually does.",Null,0,0,3 June 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Brilliant
","This is movie-making at its best, with brilliant location footage, enormous tension and excitement, fabulous performances from the entire cast, and a fine score. Most directors would be happy to have engraved on their tombstones that they directed THE BRIDGE OF THE RIVER KWAI; it is indicative of David Lean's greatness that he surpassed this film with LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.",Null,0,1,3 June 1999
The Great Escape," Great film
","Great adventure film, top to bottom: fine acting, fine direction, exceptional musical score.",Null,1,2,3 June 1999
