Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Poor.
","The worst of the lot in my opinion. Even though they tried to cram as many things as possible into the film, I was completely and utterly bored, leading me to fall asleep at one point.It was like they took all the dull parts from 2 and 3 and mashed them all together to create this film.The script was very poor, Depp was not funny, more irritating. Blackbeard is supposed to be a pirate that all pirates fear, I saw nothing of this, I just saw a man pointing his sword a lot.Another thing that really bugged me, is the fact that pretty much all the fight scenes happened at night. There are probably 3 occasions where this film is set in the daytime which leads to you not being able to see much at all, I just don't see the point.Disney should have called it a day after Curse of the Black Pearl as it has all gone down hill from there. I'm really annoyed that I wasted my money on this film, if this film spawns another trilogy then it will be a sad day, I am sick of money grabbing awful films.",3,2,4,24 May 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Good but not Great
","I have been looking forward to this film for quite some time and honestly, I feel it was rushed. It was clear that Nolan didn't even want to do a third film and this rings true for me. With the introduction of 4 major characters to all be squeezed in to just under 3 hours is just not enough time. After discussion I felt the film could have easily been halved and made in to 2 films that would have given the characters and story the time it needed to be played out. But obviously this was never going to happen.I feel it is the weakest of the trilogy (I personally think 'Begins' is the best overall, say what you will, but without Heath Ledger 'The Dark Knight' would have killed me through boredom) and would have been just 'good' for me apart from the final 20 minutes really sealing the deal and making it much better. Anne Hathaway was my star performance, I was really critical of her casting originally but she really pulled it out of the bag.Split in to 2 films this could have been a great, but unfortunately Nolan tried to squeeze 6 or 7 story arcs in to one movie. Although a decent send off to the trilogy.",7,1,5,21 July 2012
