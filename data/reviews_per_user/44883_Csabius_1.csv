The Rock," Why I like it so much...
","One of the best acting on behalf of Sean, great stuff from Nicolas too. Although a little exaggerated (a US general deserting?!) the story holds you tight in front of the TV. The common way of mocking the FBI and the US defense authorities is nothing new, but presenting Alcatraz is spectacular. Dialogs are great, (maybe not as good as in True Lies for ex, but it worth listening :) ) specially when between the 2 main characters. To enforce the action on Mason and Godspeed, the script slaughters a whole SEAL squad, which I consider highly unnecessary and violent, but suppose the writer just couldn't find any other way to do it... Puting it all together, it is a great movie, everything adds up correctly, nothing too much, nothing missing. You better book a place in a movie close by ASAP... :)",10,1,1,13 April 1999
