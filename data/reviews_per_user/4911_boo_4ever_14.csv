The Ring," Confirming what we all knew - VHS is evil
","The Ring follows the story of a journalist ,who, while investigating the death of her niece stumbles across a cursed video which kills its viewers in seven days.The Ring is based on a series of Japanese books which in turn were translated to film in Hideo Nakata's original film 'Ring'. Sometimes its impossible to talk about either film - the Japanese version or the US remake without comparing them such is the division of opinion. Taking The Ring on its own merits though it is a chilling and seriously creepy film.However if you have watched the Japanese version then some parts of the Ring will frustrate you. Such as the insistence US film makers have you holding your hand and explaining everything to you every step of the way. What ever happened to less is more? A big reason why Ring was so scary is that you knew next to nothing about the female apparition Sadako and this lent her an air of mystery. Here in The Ring we see her as a little girl sitting up and talking in bed. Not very scary. Also the main part - the video itself is just too well done in the US Ring. It looks more like a student art house film then a manifestation of evil. The Japanese version was darker, dirtier and plain freakier. As was the music.Don't get me wrong. The US Ring is still a fantastic horror film which improves on the Japanese version is some areas - just not overall. because of that its kind of impossible to say which was actually better. I personally prefer the original for the reasons I listed, but each to their own.After promising myself I wouldn't spend this comment comparing the two its obvious I need to go punish myself in some way. Perhaps I'll rent Halloween 3 again.",9,1,2,3 April 2005
The Terminator," A merciless killing machine of a movie
","There are classics and then there are classics. The Terminator has become a phenomenon, an embodiment of a ruthless killer and certainly the best robot murdering device from the future I've ever seen.Sarah Conner is understandably upset to learn that a killer cyborg from the future has been sent back to the past (which WAS the present...I think) to kill her so she cannot give birth to the future leader of man against machine. But help is at hand in the form of Kyle Reese, a soldier also sent back to protect her from the terminator.Thinking about it could make your head spin and it probably wont win many awards with Steven Hawkings but as an action film it delivers the goods. Arnold in his best ever role as an unthinking, unfeeling machine - just like in real life - is superb. It was the role he was artificially created to play. He wastes humans with reckless abandon, including a scene where he wipes out an entire police station to get to Connor. A scene so good it was even referenced in the second film.The soundtrack is a huge contributer to the mood of the film and it's the darkest of the three Terminator flicks. Even if the formula was perfected in T2 : Judgement Day the first is still a cinema classic. It will make you paranoid towards all form of machinery for weeks to the extent you'll want to live in the woods in a house made from stones and parts of animals. Remember to keep your DVD though so you can watch this over and over again.",9,1,2,3 April 2005
Alien," Absolutely shocking
",When watching this for the first time I think was the most scared I have ever been in my life.Alien is just beyond masterpiece. It drips with homicidal genius from each cell. It intrigues you and scares you in equal measure. You want to find out more about this thing which haunts space yet at the same time you're too scared to venture that far.Like a lot of the old classics Alien takes a while to set its scene. Its about half way through the film that the alien finally starts its attack. But its not boring. The atmosphere cuts through the your bone. The lighting and music lull you into a constant state of dread. Even when the coast seems clear you know that something isn't quite right.Purists will rate Alien as the best of the series. Personally I prefer Camerons Aliens but there isn't much in it. The reason I like Aliens is the all out war between the marines and the aliens. Its fine bumping off a bunch of mechanics but lets see what this species can really do....Alien is a haunted house film in space. If I'd known there were haunted houses like that on earth Id never sleep again.,9,0,1,1 April 2005
Predator," Probably the best 'hunted by alien in jungle'movie. Ever
","I suppose Predator can be divided in two parts. The first being a straight forward action movie as we follow The Governator as Dutch and his posse take out an entire wing of a guerrilla group in order to rescue some US hostages. I think this bit is very necessary as it gives you an idea of just how tough this band of guys are - they are the best of the best. This reinforces the shock of what happens next.On the way out of the jungle his team are picked off one by one by a alien hunter. Despite being in a very earthy open environment, the sense of claustrophobia as the hunt begins is immense. Its a surprisingly clever film and doesn't get enough recognition I feel.The movie is brilliantly paced, each member of the team has their own unique persona and although the story is as basic as you can get it always keeps you interested as the conflict between the unseen predator and this crack unit of soldiers is so absorbing. Its full of now classic lines and scenes, a stand out moment being when the team level half of Costa Rica with a minigun trying to draw blood from whatever is stalking them. How we laugh as Arnie cracks a 'stick around' after pinning a goon to a door with his throwing knife. OK maybe not.One of my all time favourites. I cant choose between this and T2 as my favourite Arnie flick. A sci fi classic in my opinion and one which was criminally overlooked in its day.",9,1,2,22 February 2005
The Thing," A Thing of Beauty
","I never realised it before but I'm a bit of a John Carpenter fan. I still don't like Halloween though, I find it an ordeal to sit through.This on the other hand is pure brilliance. The story revolves around a group of American researchers on an Antartic research station. After rescuing a dog from a seemingly crazy bunch of Norwegians (or were they swedes? ;)) they start falling host to an alien being that can imitate anything it assimilates. Cue plenty of suspense, paranoia and gore.This film wouldn't have worked anywhere else. The sense of isolation and hopelessness adds to the claustrophobic horror of the film. The characters, especially Carpenter veteran Kurt Russell are fantastic. It may seem on the surface a simple horror film but its so open at the same time that you can read anything into a particular scene or conversation. You feel just as paranoid as the characters on screen. Its wonderfully done. Its a testament to the film that it is being so hotly debated 23 years after it was released. I'm still not quite sure who was who, even right at the end. Whether this was intentional on the filmmakers part or arose simply because of the nature of the story I really cant say but its a major part of the films appeal.The film is also well known for its gore and creature effects which are still fantastic even today. In fact in the wake of CGI snoozefests they can be appreciated even more. Some scenes such as the defibrillator scene are simply shocking upon first viewing.A lot of films seem to focus on one aspect of horror, whether it be gore, suspense or psychological. The Thing defies convention and masters all of them effortlessly. One of the greatest horror films of all time and one of my personal favourites from any genre.",10,0,1,12 December 2005
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," He's back.
","Probably the greatest science fiction / action film ever Terminator 2 is almost the greatest sequel ever. That goes to Camerons other opus Aliens. In fact Cameron is so good at sequels Titanic 2 would probably be something to look forward too rather then fear. Unlike another Amityville Horror film.T2 takes place several years after the original. Sarah Connor has had her child - the young John Connor. Unfortunately she also came off as slightly nuts while raving about robots taking over the world and so she is locked up in a mental hospital. While this is happening another Terminator has been dispatched, this time to kill John himself. The T 1000 is a liquid metal Terminator capable of reforming into different shapes. Thankfully to combat our meltable foe Arnie returns, this time as the good guy to protect John and his mother.Its hard to review Terminator 2. Its just far too good for words. The villain played by Robert Patrick is probably the most villainous of all villains, the action is probably the most action packed of all action sequences. Plus it will also make you cry at the end. An action film. Seriously. OK just me then. Still a kind of bizarre situation where you find yourself close to shedding tears for a toaster with legs. But Terminator 2 manages it. In fact you feel Terminator 2 could do anything and get away with it. A bit like a woman in that respect.I don't know how Cameron created my two favourite films of all time. I'm sure God had something to do with it. Id like to thank him but I'm far too bust watching this film to pray.",10,6,8,3 April 2005
Aliens," Don't watch this if you're 10
","I did and it scared the bejaysus out of me. It was a defining moment in my life, one which sparked my love affair with the horror / sci fi genre.Everyone knows the 'plot'. After the events of Alien in which a alien life form wipes out her crew, Ripley returns with a tooled up team of badass marines. 'This time Its War' is the tagline and it doesn't disappoint.I believe this is a superior film to the original. There is hardly any exposition compared the the very slow build up in Alien. The action comes thick and fast interspersed by tension on a par with Ridley Scott classic. A lot of what makes this film so cool is the visual feast it supplies. The setting of the Colony is a science fiction nightmare, the weapons and vehicles are instant classics which have been aped and copied endlessly since. The cast are simply brilliant. A movie I would compare it to in this sense is Predator. The squad of soldiers are so likable that you genuinely don't want them to get picked off by the alien horde. The fact that you know they will be makes it so morbidly absorbing.As for the aliens themselves. I believe they've never looked better in the series then they do here. Its just something about the lighting, the way its shot. Not too much is shown but enough is glimpsed to make them the most terrifying screen aliens of all time. This film really took the baton provided by Alien and cemented the standards for the genre.An absolute gem of a film. There isn't a bad scene in it and its a film I could watch a million times and never get tired off. Hopefully I'll have enough time to do just that.",10,1,2,22 February 2005
Resident Evil," A nice deviation from the games
","I'm a fan of the Resident Evil vodkas. Because of that I was really looking forward to the movie. I hear Romero wanted to do something which stuck more faithfully to the plot of the games. That would have been preferable to Andersons film but thats not to say this isn't still enjoyable.The plot revolves around a virus which has the ability to reanimate dead corpses and was used to develop hideous bioweapons. When the virus escapes, the underground complex known as the Hive is sealed and a special team is sent in to investigate.Andersons film is at first nothing like the game. The original took place in a Mansion and there was no character called Alice at all who is the principal character here. However there are enjoyable references to the games such as the Licker creature which appeared in Resident Evil 2 (VG) and stalks the cast throughout the film. There is also a nice reference at the end to the Nemesis program which takes centre stage in the second film and third game.Its not a startlingly original horror film, or a film which takes the baton and refines a formula beyond what existed originally. But for fans of the games it is an interesting and enjoyable film, and that was what was intended more or less.",8,1,2,3 April 2005
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Very underrated dino packed sequel
","You didn't have to be a member of MENSA to follow the original jurassic park but it still had more substance then this. However in a way the Lost World improves in areas over it. The attacks are a lot more elaborate and chilling. The scene where the two rexs attack the trailer (with the demise of the hapless driver particularly harrowing), the raptors stalking the men through the long grass, the rex chase at the waterfall etc. All adrenaline pumping set pieces. The overrall theme seems a bit darker then the first film.Thats not to say the Lost World is perfect. Far from it. Malcolms daughter dazzling a raptor with her parallel bars routine before kicking it through a window nearly ruins the entire ending as it is. I thought the T Rex in San Diego didn't fit at all and it certainly wasn't in the book. In fact they left out one of the coolest parts of the book. None of the dinosaurs would venture near a certain part of the island as it was inhabited by a pair of dinosaurs that could become semi invisible like chameleons : the Carnotaurus. We only briefly glimpse one in JP3. Their inclusion would have raised TLW above even JP for me and I was gutted they were left out.Overall though the film succeeded in what it promised me : Jurassic Park only everything with the dinosaurs done bigger and better.",8,2,3,14 March 2005
Event Horizon," Irony
","The irony being that Paul Anderson having done so many video game to movie translations (Resident Evil, Alien vs Predator) has probably delivered the best movie of Doom that will ever be made. And it isn't even Doom.Doom is a classic video game about man using super technology to meddle with things best left alone. Portals are opened which spew satanic hordes creating an interesting mix of the technological and the arcane. The Doom movie out this summer looks to have dropped that bit entirely, instead relying on a run of the mill 'people infected by virus' excuse for all the killing. The essence of that clash though is still here in the criminally underrated Event Horizon.In Event Horizon a spaceship (of the same name) is finally found after having disappeared for several years. It seems it was conducting experiments in faster then light travel - using wormholes to travel huge distances instantly. However it may have traveled to a place no one us would dare to go. And brought back something with it...Event Horizon is a creepy horror film that doesn't rely on a CGI monster revelation at the end to get it scares. The ship itself is shaped like a cross and is itself a Gothic labyrinth. I have to confess I didn't know much about this film until I watched it thinking it was a run of the mill sci fi movie. The tension builds slowly and effectively and it has a terrific ending. The mix of hellish imagery and futuristic sci fi is a fascinating clash for me personally which is why I found myself loving this film.Paul Anderson gets a lot of stick, but don't let that put you off watching this. I've even liked Resident Evil (because I loved the videogames) and Alien vs Predator. So you can see I have a penchant for liking films which have been critically raped. Event Horizon hasn't been put through the grinder as much as the previous films but I feel it still gets unnecessary criticism, a lot of it needless 'I don't need to watch it! Its Paul Anderson!' type stuff.I still hate Soldier mind you.",9,0,2,2 April 2005
From Hell," Real life Ripped off
",From Hell takes a genuine theory about the identity of Jack the Ripper and dramatises it. We follow opium addicted inspector Abberline played by Johnny Depp as he tried to discover exactly who is stalking Londons East End. It had better not be Phil Mitchell again.The film is stylishly shot and really brings grimy victorian London to life. The story is interesting and well known. However the film is just far too long. I felt it would be far better and more gripping had it been a good half an hour shorter. It was littered with useless scenes which dragged on leaving you bored as much as you tried to get into the story. It was like the director just couldn't make up his mind what to cut and said to hell with it.The character of Jack the Ripper needing a carriage driver to get around London (with no one noticing a huge black carriage at every murder scene) reduced the impact of the character. He just didn't feel as evil or as vile when you knew without his lackey he'd be waiting for the bus like the rest of us.Just a few niggles like this prevents me from giving it my highest scores. It had potential to be a fantastic murder mystery but instead ends up too long winded for its own good. As a result is not a film you would like to see too many times.,6,1,3,31 March 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Dracula : dead and loving this.
","For me this is simply an amazing film. Having been a big fan of the novel it was refreshing to see someone go back to basics and create a film that sticks as closely to the book as possible. In much the same way Peter Jackson nailed the look and feel of the Lord of the Rings books (even if you do have doubts about his storytelling) Coppola has, for me, nailed the mood and atmosphere of the Bram Stoker classic.The story needs no elaborating on. What is worth mentioning is the stunning performance by Gary Oldman as the man himself. Bringing an element to the character seldom scene (except maybe in the Nosferatu films) you begin to almost sympathise with this evil creature. Thats quite a feat! Anthony Hopkins is one of my favourite actors and his casting as Van Helsing was inspired. What wasn't quite so clever in my opinion was the bizarre decision to cast Keanu Reeves as Harker. The guy is so wooden that two more of him should be planted if he is ever chopped down.A lot of people complained that the horror took a back seat in this film. True maybe, but it still contains a lot of creepy and downright horrifying scenes. The wolf on board The Demeter, the 'rape' scene in the garden, the Lucy scene in the tomb, the bat creature and the crucifix etc. More then a lot of other balls out horror films. Not only is it creepy it also looks incredibly lush and boasts a Gothic atmosphere not matched in many films, in part thanks to the fantastic music.A must see for fans of the book and horror / Gothic fans everywhere. Its also a film so good anyone can enjoy it. Except those of course who support the notion that Keanu Reeves is a good actor.",10,2,6,15 December 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Nightmarish - at the time
","The first and best of the Nightmare on Elm Street series.The children of Elm Street are being murdered in their dreams by serial child killer Fred Kreuger. Nightmare is quite a surreal film. When I first watched it years ago it was hard to tell what was real and what wasn't. This added to the terror. Its not so frightening today but it still holds up very well especially against its dire clones and sequels.The reason why the first Nightmare is far superior to its sequels is that it plays to its strenghts. Freddy is a horror character not a comedian. Here he plays the classic bogeyman - a symbol of terror and not the lovable wish cracking anti hero of subsequent films. Not just in the way he acts but also in the way he looks. Freddys makeup in this film is pretty horrible - but in a good way. We can see he has been badly burnt and can see strips of flesh hanging from his face if you look hard enough. Its dirty, slimy and unpleasant. In other films its obvious its a mask. And a pretty clean one at that.This one also has all the classic scenes. The claw appearing above the bed, the teenager being slashed in mid air, Johnny Depp getting sucked into his bed and turned into a fountain of blood. Its nice to know a set back like that didn't stop him from furthering a successful movie career. The ending falls a bit flat with Freddy being bashed with hammers and set on fire like in a Tom and Gerry cartoon but its easy to look past it, especially to the final scene where again you don't know if its real or not.Speaking of that final scene I'm almost sure I seen a different ending again where it WAS a dream. Or maybe I was dreaming myself.",8,0,0,3 April 2005
Jurassic Park," Dino -mite! (sorry)
","As a kid who was fascinated by dinosaurs JP was a dream come true for me. I was obsessed with this film. Because of this I still love the series - even Lost World and JP3.A lot of people miss the point I think when reviewing Jurassic Park films. For me anyway its all about the dinosaurs and the set pieces involving them. I don't watch for the in depth science talk or character development. Altho having said that the science babble in the first film here partly inspired my love of science.By todays standards Jurassic Park takes a long time to get going and unless you are interested in the science behind it you're going to get pretty bored during the first 45 mins or so. Until of course you are hit when one of the most memorable moments in film history - the Rex attack. From then on its a dinosaur onslaught, and while I think the dino attacks are better done in the later films, here they still pack a punch.I loved everything about this movie. Even the music has become synonymous with some of my favourite summer memories.",9,4,5,14 March 2005
