Child 44," Very poor book adaptation
","I sincerely doubt that the author of original Child 44 novel, Tom Rob Smith, had a chance to read the script for this movie, as this movie adaptation of the plot is just beyond the definition of bad. Not only the movie has very little resemblance to the novel itself, it actually seems that the script writers have zero understanding of the Soviet history, upon which the events unravel. All events in the movie are not coherent, the motivation of characters is the mystery, and the thriller part gets lost in a seriously dubious attempt to portray the ugliness of 'the Soviet Russia'. And what did they do to Tom Hardy, why every sentence he says sounds like he's seriously drunk. Is that supposed to mean 'Russian accent'? So Russian language sounds like English, but after drinking half bottle of vodka? This movie is just so very bad, it's not even worth a review. The movie which was supposed to be about the mystery, is a mystery in itself - the mystery of how some good actors, including Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman, agreed to be in it. However, just to warn others, I must warn ya: better read the book, it's really good and don't waste time watching this movie. It really has nothing to do with the book, apart from the name itself.",1,2,7,4 October 2015
War Machine," Wow, what a movie, an eye-opener really. Won't be an easy watch for hardline believers.
","Just finished watching War Machine with Brad Pitt on Netflix. Wow, what a movie and an eye- opener. Really lets you put things into perspective and see the world through another person's eyes and ideas. Having watched it left me with an utmost respect for the protagonist Gen. Glen McMahon (portrayed after real life persona Gen. Stanley McChrystal). What a guy. Need to read his books now. Warning: Obama is portrayed quite controversially there, and not just implicitly. That trick with the meeting on Air Force One, wow what an asshole move, makes you question the integrity of the president you so long considered ideal. It is healthy to look at things through the eyes of people with views that may be different from yours. But it can be painful: if your point of view is unmovable, it can lead to frustration and disappointment. So a fair warning to those hardline viewers: it won't be an easy viewing if you can't consider other points of view or accept that what you believe may be different from reality.",10,35,56,27 May 2017
Alien: Covenant," How NOT to colonize a planet
","After watching Alien: Covenant I can't stop thinking that all these movies are based on one underlying condition: human stupidity. If it wasn't for the characters' doing their best to win the Darwin Awards, we wouldn't have any movies. Let me explain.With the Universe being >14 billion years old, and the Earth ~ 4.5 billion years, any other planet which is as old as Earth with an atmosphere resembling that of the Earth, will inevitably have some sort of life form. And even if for some reason the evolution didn't create intelligent life (though I'm sure it would), there would be Life. Therefore, the whole idea of bringing in people to colonize this kind of planet is stupid in itself. Colonise my ass dumb-ass.Then. Even if, for some reason, due to some really bad catastrophic events, some life form on this Planet had been annihilated, but the vegetation is booming and atmospherically everything gives you thumbs-up, then we already know who will probably inhabit this kind of planet. Guess who can survive most dramatic cataclysms? Micro-life, bacteria and viruses. Some of which, as we already know, can even survive in the outer space without any problems. Can you imagine, they don't even need spacesuits to survive? And we all know it because that's what Earth went through quite a few times.Therefore, those 'colonizers' who jump out of their spaceships without any proper reconnaissance are going to win the Darwin Awards by default. Why the *beep* don't you give the robots do their job, dumb-ass? Are you so unhappy that robots took away some of your jobs that you want to take away some of theirs too?And what kind of instruction tells them to walk around this planet without wearing any sort of suits or protection! Oh, is the Earth-ish atmosphere good reason enough? Did they forget that it wasn't just the European colonizers who wiped out the Ingenious population of the American continent, but the microbes? And if walking around without protective suits is not killing you fast enough, just go poke your nose into everything you see, sniff those flowers, touch those unfamiliar objects with bare hands - because why the *beep* not...",5,8,18,18 May 2017
