Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The first ten minutes were great, but the rest was garbage!
","Why did Lucas let this film go to ruin is beyond me. It had great potential, in fact the amazing Jedi scenes in the first 10 minutes made me almost cry tears of pure space movie joy. We have never seen the real Jedi's in action so this was fantastic. Then Jar Jar walked in and I was disgusted with the whole thing. If it hadn't been for the friends I was with, I would have walked. It's so bad I won't even dignify the film further with a description. The idea that cute commercial content = even bigger bucks than just making a great film really bites.",1,1,3,12 June 2000
The Lego Movie," Excellent film, one of the funniest yet insightful with a great message to us all.
","So many laughs that take you by surprise, I was expecting a nice cartoon for kids movie but turn into a wild ride with great characters popping up along the way. If you liked some of the toy story bits where you see Mcdonalds happy meal toys in a support group or Barbie as the tour guide through a toy store, that is one of the comedy veins in this film. There is so much i could say but just go and see it. I took my 9 year old son, and 12 year daughter 2 days ago. He has been Lego inspired since and she just bought the soundtrack from the iTunes store. Nuff said, its great, one of the best comedy films I have seen in years.",9,0,2,9 February 2014
Gladiator," This film has made my top ten
","I haven`t had a change in my top ten movies since pulp fiction. A very well presented story of a Roman General who is wronged and fights for the right reasons. Family and loyalty. A smooth pace that keeps you interested all the way through. Amazing performances, great action, realistic but still reminded me of some ancient Roman fable. Excellent job by Ridley Scott. I`d recommend this to everybody.",10,0,0,26 May 2000
