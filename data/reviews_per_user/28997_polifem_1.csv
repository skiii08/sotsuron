Marie Antoinette," ouch ...
","A 'daring' movie from Mrs. Copolla. This is her vision on one of the most shameful period of monarchy in France, in which Maria Antonia Josefa Johanna Von Habsburg-Lothringen had lots of sexual, drugs and alcohol excesses and finished being executed by guillotine.She was the one to blame for the French revolution.I think she was put in a too good spot with this film, even though she did not deserve it!The soundtrack was the funny part of this movie, though in some way it fits the action.My opinion ... wait until it appears on DVD, it's better for you, you will be able to stop it whenever you think it's enough!!! cheers",4,1,4,3 January 2007
