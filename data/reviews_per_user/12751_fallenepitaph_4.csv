Deja Vu," it could've been...
","Deja vu starts littler dull ; with nothing different than what we see on shows like CSI every week. Of course the scale of the start disaster is much bigger;but no thanks to the weak directing;the 9/11ish event and all those lovely dead people doesn't really get to us.when you go through the first 25 minutes;which is really ordinary; you see what the movie is all about.(spoilers from here)the government has a device that lets them see past;see exactly 4 days somewhat hours ago and they use this new technology to see anything in the past,of course with limitations.from this point;one of the greatest chases of the movie history begins and lasts for the first half of the movie.it's really brilliant,and it remains that way.when they learn that they can interact with the past; the movie takes you to the edge of the scene;and you feel like you are about to see a conclusion that you've never seen before.but instead,it takes a grim twist and for the last quarter of the movie;it becomes a mindless 'cop who went back in time to save the girl' thing.i am really really curious how someone could have come up with such an unique idea like the 'snow white' but be stupid enough to turn it into a stupid time machine- hey look the pieces are coming together-kind of action.i'm so sorry for this movie.the second half should be rewritten to take it into classics.but this way;it's just a 'worth watching but nothing special' movie.",5,0,1,27 April 2007
Spider-Man 3," rushed
","first of all ; it was a good movie.more than two hours of entertaining action and emotion.a great way to pass a Sunday afternoon.but anything more than that? or will it actually make comic-fans happy?Nope,sadly..the problem of spider man 3 is born right into the greatest advantage of it ; great,entertaining super characters.the film has many of them and it is really never boring;but it is just too much to draw together in any clever ways;so the plot is extremely rushed and FULL of holes. everything in the last 30 minutes is just too fast;the action doesn't let you question anything like 'why are the odds that Eddie went to the same church with spider man' or 'so if this sandman person is a good family guy how does he OK to killing an innocent woman and if this venom is so strong and full of hate why does he runs to sandman for help before even trying to face spider man himself? and more;is spider-man really a jerk that he left that kind of black monster out and didn't even look down to see what happened to it? all of those questions linger in your mind as you run towards the final action scene;which was long anticipated before the rumors of the movie started to come out;and it could have been a really good,classic battle.At least that was what i was expecting when i looked at the rest of the movie (i actually 'woaa'ed at the scene spider man saved Gwen Stacy;it was breathtaking)but instead you see characters flying all over;and possibly the most fearsome character of the series;venom; coming and leaving without even a decent fight.so i left the theater unsatisfied.it is not a all emotion movie like superman returns but it definitely has something burdening it;maybe the goblin shouldn't be in there;so they could save time for spider-man vs venom.it was more entertaining ;even in the animated series!! great action ; great humor (the jj.Jameson office table scene!!) and great drama ; with a rushed plot with holes too big to ignore and an unsatisfying boss fight.overall ; i can say it was a great movie but it was a disappointment for anyone who has been waiting to see some kind of venom for all these years.this was not what i wanted.",7,2,5,4 May 2007
Transformers," nice for kids of 90s
","Lets start at the top ; this is not a good movie. The storyline is inconsistent , the genre is vague , the scenes are not well tied together, dogs follow the kid, dogs disappear, kid loses his pants, and they are back on him again , soldiers take a cube that holds the fate of the world to take it to a safe place, and they also take two childs to come with,for absolutely no reason , a kid is fast enough to outrun a f-16like plane, but not smart enough to think that getting in a chopper when there are flying robots around is not a good idea,some girl is stupid enough to follow,not escape from, evil robots,vs. vs..But it was Transformers. it was what i watched for all my childhood, come to life! it was so much fun to watch them transform , move and talk (but not fight,the battle scenes are awful,sadly:()it was really funny to watch Sam go through all those things,it was cool to see megatron,and stuff..the battle scenes were really disappointing. except the one that prime kills another robot with his sword, you cant really understand who is attacking who,who does what,and things like that.scenes are too fast and camera never stops shaking,so all you see is metal clashing and shaking.this was the real disappointment.the rest doesn't matter because it is not a deep movie,it doesn't try to be,so a consistent storyline and stuff like that aren't really important;the goal is to see a car becoming a robot and talk.well, the comedy was too exaggerated ; they try to make you laugh at almost every scene,and when they try to be sad,they fail miserably..still,it was Transformers.it is a great choice for anyone who ever loved the cartoons and for people who are just looking for a plain fun&funny,mindless entertainment.",5,2,6,8 July 2007
Click," what the..
","First of all , it was written 'jim carry' all over adam sandler for the whole movie.the second ; i HATE comedy movies getting dramatic towards the end. And this one was waaaay out of line.the first half was funny,but not that funny,nothing special,jokes that all remind 'bruce almighty'and some other movies.the remote controller could create much more complex and funny situations...than the fast forwarding starts and the dog dies and the father dies and he plays the part he goes away over and over than tells that he loves him back and stuff,and it is almost impossible not to cry.and than everything keeps falling apart. you just get a funny tongue joke but thats all,the rest of the second half is plain drama,and with the main guy crawling under water with a broken heart(literally)to tell one last message to his son or something. it feels like the director wanted to shot a drama , but the producers didn't allow,so he created a comedy that turns into it.i was looking forward to have a really good time , laughing, instead i found myself questioning life and that was NOT what i paid for!",5,3,6,9 September 2006
