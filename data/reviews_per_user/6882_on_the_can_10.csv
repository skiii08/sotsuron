The Incredible Hulk," Good one!
","I'll start by saying that I actually liked the 2003 Ang Lee Hulk and was initially disappointed when I heard they were rebooting rather than continuing, but when this movie was over and my friend said, 'that was a zillion times better than the first one,' I had to agree.With Louis Letterier's The Incredible Hulk, you get a much more down to earth streamlined version of the Hulk everybody wanted the first time around. This is not to say in the least that it's nothing but a CGI fest, all the contrary. The script is smart, not just in its science but in its dialog and handling of the otherworldly subject matter. Letterier, with the help of Edward Norton and company do a remarkable job of convincing you that this could actually happen, even though we all know it couldn't. Characters are strongly developed with well paced tension that eventually builds to a heart stopping climax on the streets of New York. Your movie ticket's gonna buy you heart, humor and loads of thrills and action folks.It's a little disheartening to think that this film's success may easily be hampered by movie goers who still have a bad taste in their mouth from 2003, I wanna address that. This is not a sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 film. This is a complete reboot, they started again from scratch, to make amends and they have succeeded. The movie does a great job of starting over by giving you only snippets in the form of early flashbacks to show how the Hulk was created and what sent Bruce Banner on the run from the law. This sets the movie into action in record time. We catch up with him some years later, he hasn't seen the love of his life, Betty in all that time and she has yet to see or even realize what Bruce's problem really is. Bruce is hiding in Brazil and has been off the grid for about six months, but when a freak accident catches the attention of his pursuers in the U.S. he's on the run again, and eventually forced back home.Ironically, considering a common complaint of the original movie was its inaccuracies to the comic book, this film draws more from the 1970's TV series for its back story and the tone even follows suit somewhat as well. With Bruce on the run we get a lot of action and suspense even when he isn't green and we get our heart from his relationship with Betty. Some comic relief comes from this as well. The movie is much darker in tone than some of the more recent superhero movies and the action gets pretty intense too, they definitely push the boundaries of their PG-13 rating. If you've liked Marvel's other ventures you will probably like this film, but if you're a fan of the original series, the comic and or cartoons, or quite frankly a fan of action adventure movies in general, go see this movie, you WILL like it. I'll say it again, cuz I want Marvel to continue with what could easily be an amazing franchise. Go see this movie!!!",8,2,3,23 June 2008
Inglourious Basterds," Old Uncle Adolf
",With Inglourious Basterds Quentin Tarantino gives us a very different movie from what we normally expect. Mainly cuz it's not a crime movie. This isn't a non linear plot or collection of short stories and it's not a hodge podge of pop culture references among gangsters and assassins. All that being said though it is very much a Tarantino movie.I won't get into a long drawn out explanation of that...you'll know what I mean when you see it...in spite of the subject matter and lack of some of his trademarks his stamp is all over WWII and you gotta wonder what took him so long to climb into that time machine. For any naysayers out there who have grown tired of his regular convictions this flick should prove you wrong.In truth I don't have a lot to say about the movie because it was quite different from what I was expecting I don't wanna give anything away. It's more of a war thriller than an action yarn as the ads would suggest with a clever interwoven plot that includes several international characters all masterfully portrayed by their actors. It also a has a tremendous sense of fun and humor so even the most graphic or disturbing themes of the material won't dampen your mood. Good movie...I liked it.,8,1,6,27 August 2009
Spider-Man 3," Entertaining
","I can't help but think that if it weren't for the legions of Venom fans devastated over his lack of screen time that this movie would have at least been well liked for it's entertainment value.The tragedy of Spider-man 3 is the knowledge of what could have been. The story goes that this film's screenplay was originally intended to span two films with Ben Kingsley already lined up to play the Vulture who would have been the primary villain of the first film. One would then assume that Parker wouldn't have ditched his black suit until the finale, saving Venom to be the main contender of the follow up. This is what should have been done. Venom is a very cool character for many more reasons than his appearance, but his screen time is kept so short here that nobody outside of the comic fans know it. Comic fans are sad he's not in it more...everyone else wonders why he was in it at all. Because of the hodgepodge of activity crammed into the story he's reduced to a two dimensional character who is ultimately defeated too fast to promote any real threat.But like I said, in spite of it's faults this is a very entertaining movie and given the volume of material Raimi and his team had to juggle with they did a remarkable job of presenting it. There's a ton of action, lots of humor and amazing special effects. The plot of course does not live up to the standards of the first two and that is it's main downfall...but to be fair the first two set the bar fairly high. This franchise isn't dead though and I imagine everyone's learned from their mistakes, I can't wait for number 4.If you like fun action movies this is a fun ride. Watch it with an open mind...just because it fell short of it's potential doesn't mean it's a bad movie.",7,1,2,4 May 2007
Tropic Thunder," Quite simply a riot
","I'm just gonna come right out and say it, 'I loved this movie!' I laughed consistently through the whole thing and at the moment it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite some time.Who better to write and direct a movie about Hollywood and its eccentricities than Ben Stiller, a guy who grew up in the fold with actor parents? If you've seen the trailers you know the story. A handful of troublesome actors are dumped in the middle of Vietnam by their director in an effort to scare worthy performances out of them with guerrilla style film making tactics. What you don't see is the fact that in spite of the film being set mostly around the main actors in the jungle, the entire film industry is skewered right down to the last key grip. Agents and producers fight over whether to favor money or common human decency. Actors argue over method. An effects guy is just plain insane. And the war vet who wrote the source material for their production is just as crazy as the drug dealers our heroes run a foul of. Every actor, including the many cameos spread among the celluloid are at the top of their game. People who like to laugh should be easily entertained here and anyone who has ever watched a behind the scenes documentary may very well bust a gut before it's half over.As for the controversy behind this. Don't peg it before you've seen it. The use of the word retard should not in anyway be construed as offensive in this film. They are making fun of people(especially Hollywood's) perception of the mentally challenged. That's the whole point of the movie. The same point made with Robert Downey Jr. in black face. The movie is poking fun of its own industry...and industry with a dubious reputation for the amoral and misinformed. That's why this is classic.",10,7,16,16 August 2008
The Dark Knight," Wicked
","Christopher Nolan and his team have really done something spectacular with The Dark Knight. They've taken a character that everybody in the world knows in a genre that is getting more exposure now than anything else and elevated it to something different...this is not just a superhero movie, this is a crime thriller and damn good one.In the comics and great animated series of the 1990's Batman is the world's greatest detective. In most screen incarnations however he's been portrayed as just a high flying superhero with an arsenal of James Bondesque gadgetry. This isn't always a bad thing, don't get me wrong, I'm still a huge fan of Tim Burton's original two Batfilms. But The Dark Knight carries on from Batman Begins, portraying our hero as a brooding tortured force who collects evidence and thinks out missions and defenses. He's not an entirely one man show either, he talks with cop buddy Jim Gordon, enlists help from his only two confidants (butler, Alfred and CEO Lucius), and gets involved, albeit from the shadows, in city politics, trying to get close enough to the new DA to determine if he's worthy of entering the Batfold, and something entirely new and unexpected, Batman holds out hope of bestowing enough peace on the city that he can hang up his cape and cowl.All this gets threatened of course by the new kid on the block. The sadistic and psychotic Joker ingeniously played by the remarkably well cast Heath Ledger (he manages to be hilarious without the use of one liners and sight gags). The Joker sets up and pulls strings all over Gotham city making life a living hell for everybody and he does it with such glee you'd be cheering him on if you weren't scared of him at the same time. It's also because of his presence that you can never even guess where the movie will take you next. He's so manipulative and conniving in his criminal plot and insanity that almost everything you are led to believe will happen doesn't. There is one twist after another between fights, chases, murder investigations and bent tension.The only issue I can really take with the film is Maggie Gyllenhal's replacement of Katie Holmes. My gripe isn't with Maggie personally, just with the unfortunate affect I think it had on a key plot point of the film. I've never liked it when characters are recast in sequels anyway but the role of her character Rachel Dawes though maybe smaller in terms of screen time from the first one plays a very significant role in the plot and her actions in it would undoubtedly carry more weight if we could see her as the same character we met previously and not be forced to accept a new face as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend. In an otherwise excellent film though, this is a small complaint.The Dark Knight does not disappoint. I can't wait to see the next one.",10,6,13,19 July 2008
The Happening," Umm....
","...I just don't know. That's probably the best way to describe my, and quite likely everyone else's, reaction when this movie's credits started to roll.The movie starts out with a lot of promise. New York's Central park suddenly grinds to a halt and its once bustling inhabitants start walking backwards, talking in gibberish and eventually committing suicide. We then flash over to a construction site where workers begin throwing themselves from their gerters to the ground below in front of the teary eyes of their friends. The incidents are assumed initially to be the result of some sort of bio-chemical terrorist attack and New York is eventually evacuated. Neighboring Philadelphia soon follows suit and this is where we are introduced to our main characters, played my Mark Wahlberg, Zooey Deschanel, John Leguizamo and his on screen daughter. They, along with thousands of others start their trek away from whatever the hell is going on.If this ever actually happened we'd all be quaking in our boots, combine that with the strong opening and you are easily strapped in and genuinely curious to see what happens next. The problem is the movie runs along at a relatively slow pace, which you will probably gladly sit through in anticipation for the pay off at the end...unfortunately, there really is no pay off to look forward to. The cause of the Happening is presented early on as a theory and doesn't take long before it's presented as likely fact by our protagonist. The ora of mystery that falls over the first 30 minutes of the movie is more or less destroyed by this epiphany and there's little more to keep you guessing. By now you care enough about the characters to root for them and keep you invested, but by the end I still felt cheated out of something, I just didn't know what. M. Night Shyamalan's made a career out of surprise twist endings that turn your entire perception of the preceding film on its head. If ever there was flick made for that it's The Happening, but he decides not to cash in and instead turns it into what feels like a 90 min PSA for global warming.As far as acting John Leguizamo is the stand out while Wahlberg is good but not great as he often is. I like Zooey Deschanel but she's wooden and unlikable for the lion's share of the movie, which isn't at all her fault given the dialog and scripted personality she's handed. You do get a sense of her improv prowess though, during two scenes of solitude, while she waits and fidgets impatiently.M. Night Shyamalan is without question a talented director, however. As week as his story is, it is also well shot and paced. There is some very clever camera work that actually manages to be scary in of itself. Creepy almost in its simplicity. I don't think he's earned the rank of today's Hitchcock like some have bestowed upon him, though. Talented, yes, Hitchcock, no. Some of Alfred's stuff is better than others, but I've never seen a Hitchcock film I didn't like.Like I've said or at least implied the movie's entertaining enough to keep you from looking at your watch, but by the end of it you can't quite understand why. Maybe it will appreciate in time and fewer expectations. I will gladly give it a second chance.But a warning to gore fans. The movie's promotions like to highlight the R rating this receives but given the lack of graphic violence, course language or even suggestive humor I don't think Shyamalan was going for the R rating so much as it was just given to him.",5,1,4,18 June 2008
War of the Worlds," Very cool, very slick, very underrated
","People are way too hard on this movie! It's a thriller! And it's a good one! The movie is paced perfectly and never feels slow at a moment. Even during the set up for the first twenty minutes or so when we're introduced to the main characters we're given enough comic relief and interesting camera work to keep you in your seat, and then once all hell breaks loose it's a thrill ride for the rest of the movie.I've heard people complain about the plot of this movie, but that's way too pompous. Maybe you won't walk away with a better out look on life but that's not what Spielberg was going for. If you've seen the trailers you know the plot, aliens come to earth and basically try to wipe us out. One comment I heard was that all it was one thrill after another with no real point, but that is the point. It's a survival story just like the book it was based on. The camera sticks on Tom Cruise and his family while they try desperately to stay alive during the carnage. It's not about a superhero, a brilliant scientist, or a team of marines trying to fight off aliens, it's about an average joe trying to stay alive. He doesn't have the means to fight back on his own, and if he did he'd lose that everyman quality and we wouldn't be able to relate to him the way we do. This is a movie about a war (whether it involves aliens or not) from a bystanders point of view.Another complaint is comments about the ending. There have been two common complaints about it, I won't get into specifics because I don't wanna ruin it for anybody but I'll try and comment anyhow. There's been one complaint involving the aliens, some people didn't think there was enough of a climax. This aspect of the ending is taken right from H.G. Welles' book and it was used in the original movie as well. In fact when you take into account that the book was over a hundred years old, they actually did a pretty faithful job of adapting it to modern day. There's an irony about that ending that was always the main point of the story and actually makes more sense when you stop to think about it. The other complaint about the ending has to do with Cruise's family. I must admit this part is a little unrealistic but it's not nearly enough to ruin an otherwise awesome flick. Anyone who would reprimand an entire movie for something that minor has some deeper issues to work out.The movie's fast, exciting and most importantly entertaining. That's all you need sometimes.",9,1,2,9 May 2006
Hancock," Good Flick...bad marketing.
","Hancock is the product of two very strong ideas that don't quite mesh as well as it's creators likely hoped. The first idea is that of an alcoholic superhero who only saves lives due to some natural compulsion that he can't fight but otherwise cares nothing for anybody. The other idea is a gritty realistic look at what life as a superhero would be like. The emphasis of the story is the latter, while the previews imply the former.The first half of the movie plays out similarly to a super powered bad Santa...making for some very good and unique laughs. As Hancock attempts to clean up his act though things take a much darker turn and we learn that Hancock does in fact have a heart and it's broken.If Super powers really did exist in this extremity Hancock's plot would likely be a pretty good representation of it's pitfalls. The guy's lonely as all hell, he drinks, he costs millions in property damage for every act of heroics. This is something different that we've never seen, Spider-man's not always loved by everyone he saves but at least he was never handed a bill for breaking a window.Despite a good box office return I think feelings of the movie from it's general audience were only Luke warm but I think it will appreciate in value as time goes on. It's a superhero drama with a very interesting and original plot, it's just too bad it was marketed as a superhero action comedy. A stronger villain would've have helped to inject more action into the movie and possibly would have made everybody happy...the movie is a little slow but I've seen it a couple times and it's already grown more on me. I urge everybody to give a chance...even if it's a second one.",6,0,2,8 April 2009
WALL·E," Whoa
","It's pretty damn impressive when a film can keep you engrossed for 90 minutes plus with virtually no dialog in it at all.In the distant future Earth is abandoned by everyone for reasons I won't spoil here. Before they leave, everything is turned off, scrapped, or taken with them...except Wall E, a robot who was accidentally left on. Wall E spends his days collecting junk, building amazing towers of cubed garbage, watching old movies, paling around with his cockroach friend(the only other living thing left on Earth) and day dreaming about one day falling in love. His dreams are answered when a girl probe robot gets dropped on Earth in search of organic life. Wall E falls head over heels and follows her home when her ship comes back for her. taking him on the adventure Pixar always promises.Like I said, the two leads barely speak, the only real dialog comes later by other characters after most of the plot has already been well established. But this doesn't encumber the story at all. Wall E tells us everything we need to know with his hands and eyes. The movie's not as laugh out loud hilarious as some of Pixar's other ventures but it's very entertaining and a high accomplishment in film making. It also has a lot of amazing imagination and imagery...the guys a Pixar should be proud.",8,3,6,6 July 2008
V for Vendetta," Kubrick would be proud
","The V for Vendetta graphic novel would surely have been loved by Stanley Kubrick and the V for Vendetta movie is surely one Kubrick would have loved to direct.In the future, England is over run by a totalitarian government made possible by an evil conspiracy that left several hundred's dead and one horribly scarred survivor whom the government would rather forget. In other words, England has become the country Hitler wanted the whole world to be back in the forties, and there's one man out there determined to change that. He goes by the name V, expertly wields a set of knives, knows all kinds of ways to kick your ass and proudly sports a Guy Fawkes mask. Guy Fawkes was a man in English history who was hung for trying to blow up the parliament building in the 17th century, and now V is determined to finish what he started and along the way rally the population of England against their fascist government.The film is loaded with historical references and their modern day parallels, political connotations and in its own way debates the rights and wrongs, causes and effects of activism. It encourages freedom of speech and the righteous stance but does this all within the context of an action movie. V is basically a terrorist standing up for the little guy, he goes about the film raising hell, blowing up monuments, picking off those who done him wrong and doing his best to make it clear to everybody that things need to change, and he's only gonna be the beginning.There are scenes in this movie that can stand next to many of the great action flicks and some that can ride alongside that of a political thriller. There are some slower moments here too, but they're so enriched with great acting and story telling that you can hardly fault the makers for slouching on the pace...especially when it all builds to its big finale.This film may very well not be for everybody, which in of itself is a good reason to compare it Kubrick. It's a smart action movie with a bit of interesting commentary. The morality of it all in my mind comes second to the spectacle of it all, but it's a great add on to a solidly entertaining film.",8,2,6,20 August 2008
