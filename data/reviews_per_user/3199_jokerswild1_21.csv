The Mask," Smokin'!
","Originally intended to be a horror film that would replace A Nightmare On Elm Street as New Line Cinema's big horror franchise, The Mask took a comedic turn when director Chuck Russell came aboard, who was ironically the director of A Nightmare On Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors.Loosely based on the first half of the much darker comic series of the same name, The Mask is about Stanley Ipkiss, a cartoon-loving bank clerk who lets everybody walk all over him. Stanley discovers a strange mask in the harbour, and upon putting the mask on he gains the power to bend reality and his personality is amplified, turning him into a love-crazy wild man with the characteristics of a zany cartoon character.The intentionally cartoonish visual effects are great, and Jim Carrey's performance fits the character's actions perfectly. Cameron Diaz makes her debut in this film, and never looked better. Peter Riegert portrays a police lieutenant trying to catch the Mask, and does a great job playing the straight man.I never would've guessed I'd peg the sequel to such a great movie among the five worst films I've ever seen.",9,1,1,21 February 2014
Alien 3," A worthy entry in the series that should have concluded it
","While not a masterpiece like Alien or Aliens, Alien 3 is still quite a good film, and it would have been better if the series had ended here rather than continuing with the absurd Alien: Resurrection, and the even worse Alien vs. Predator films.After the events of Aliens, the supposedly malfunctioning Sulaco launches an escape pod, which crashes on Fiorina 161, a mostly uninhabited planet that has like a smelting facility and prison on it. Hicks and Newt are both killed in the accident, and Bishop is destroyed beyond repair. Ripley is the only survivor. The prison workers take her in, and she is warned that her mere presence will disturb the cycle of the prison and its inmates, all of which are reborn Christians with pasts of rape and murder. A facehugger makes its way from the escape pod, and impregnates an animal in the prison (a dog or a cow, depending on whether you watch the theatrical cut or the assembly cut), which soon births an alien that wreaks havoc in the prison and Ripley and the inmates attempt to stop it, and the fact is that the prison has little to no weapons complicates trying to kill it. Ripley soon discovers she has been impregnated with an alien queen, and the alien will not kill her because of it, giving her a morbid edge to stop it.Sigourney Weaver's performance is stellar. The highlight of her acting is in the scene where an autopsy is performed on Newt's corpse. Her facial expression and the sadness she emotes is fantastic, she really sells the tragedy her character has gone through and makes you feel really sorry for her. The supporting cast is all around good, the best of them being Charles Dance and Charles S. Dutton.The new quadruped alien is quite cool, and it's interesting to watch it's behavioral differences from the aliens in the previous two films. It isn't as sadistic and calculating as the alien in the first film, and being a singular alien, it doesn't have the hive mentality the aliens in the second film. This one is more quick to kill, and does as such more violently than before, possibly to thin out the amount of people who may harm the alien queen when it's born.There are some aspects of the film that beg for an explanation, most glaringly how exactly an alien egg got on the Sulaco. It seems to work of the alien queen, but it doesn't make much sense how or when she could have put it there. The assembly is quite a bit better than the theatrical cut, but there are two things I prefer from the theatrical cut, the first of which being that the alien comes from a dog rather than a cow (which makes more sense given how it moves), and the second of which being how the alien queen bursts from Ripley's chest as they both fall into the furnace.Quite a few scripts were written for Alien 3, all of which were vastly different. William Gibson's script was little more than a more EXTREEEEEEME!!! version of Aliens, which would've been pretty lame and not at all interesting. Eric Red's script was horribly bad, containing several plot holes and ridiculous plot points (it had an alien chicken, believe it or not). David Twohy's and Vincent Ward's scripts were interesting, but Twohy's script was too divorced from the previous films, and Ward's script had a major concept that didn't fit in with the series at all (a planet constructed of wood). Aspects of Twohy's and Ward's scripts were combined and rewritten into a different version of Alien 3 by Walter Hill & David Giler and Larry Ferguson that ended up as the finished film, and I'd say what got made was the best of any of the scripts.David Fincher, the director of Alien 3, has actually since disowned the movie due to his terrible experience of actually making it. His troubles ranged from constant studio interference to the pressure of being the successor to Ridley Scott and James Cameron, and given that it was his first feature length film and he had to deal with so much making it, his directorial work on it is pretty impressive.It has its flaws, but Alien 3 is ultimately a good movie. It keeps with the tone of the series, adding some new and interesting aspects and conclusively wraps up the story arc of Ripley and the aliens. It's too bad the series had to continue and venture into such lame territory.",8,4,4,8 April 2014
Batman Returns," The Last Truly Great Batman Film
","Only three years after Batman, Tim Burton and Michael Keaton returned to provide the same entertainment on a level nearly as grand as the first.Joining the great Keaton are Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Christopher Walken, all three playing new additions to his rogues gallery. DeVito plays the grotesque Penguin, a rejected freak who rises from the sewers of Gotham City, and Michelle Pfeiffer plays Catwoman, deadly as she is lovely, seeking revenge on her boss Max Schreck, a corrupt businessman played by Walken.The great thing about the villains is how they all mirror Batman in certain ways, all adding up to a vibe similar to A Christmas Carol. The Penguin is like the Ghost of Christmas Past, an orphaned man that had extremely rich parents, just like Batman. Catwoman is like the Ghost of Christmas Present, like Batman she leads a double life, but goes to more major extremes. Max Schreck is the Ghost of Christmas Future, a corrupt and powerful businessman who takes out those who get in his way, the path Batman is heading down. Batman himself is not unlike Scrooge, sitting alone as Bruce Wayne in his gloomy mansion and waiting to become Batman again.Keaton and Pfeiffer have a lot of great chemistry, the two had previously dated in real life, and it's clear what a positive effect it had on their performances in the film. DeVito is great as the Penguin, slimy and evil, his physical appearance perfectly suits his personality. The character of Max Schreck is interesting, wearing a more metaphorical mask than Batman and Catwoman, and it's interesting to see a corrupt businessman have such a major impact on the more fantastical characters like Batman, Catwoman, and the Penguin.Danny Elfman's score of the film is as great as the first, if perhaps not more so. Bo Welch's designs aren't quite on the level of Anton Furst's, but still very impressive, the production design remains atmospheric and really sells what a dark and grimy place Gotham is. Daniel Waters' script is full of humor and clever darkness, no surprise from the man who wrote Heathers, this film has an endless number of great quotes.I do not feel any of the other Batman films have again risen to the grand level of Tim Burton's two films, and I doubt another one ever will. Lightning already struck twice, it's unlikely to strike a third time.",10,9,24,19 November 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Very Impressive
","The main thing I enjoyed about the first Captain America film was its period setting, so when it was obvious that future films wouldn't have this, I doubted I would like the Captain America sequel as much. Turns out, Captain America: The Winter Soldier isn't only better than the first movie, it rivals The Avengers.Chris Evans is a great lead, and he builds on his role, the character has more personal conflicts than he did in his first solo film and The Avengers. Scarlett Johansson continues to improve on her role as Black Widow, she has a very good balance of intelligence, fighting ability, and emotion. She's also very attractive. Actually, scratch that. She's more like one of the closest people I can think of to being physically perfect. Nick Fury is given more to do this time around, a considerable improvement over his role in Iron Man 2 when the most memorable thing he did was telling Tony Stark to get off a donut. Anthony Mackie is also very good, and they make sure to establish him well before just putting him in the action.Something that was lacking in Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World was the villains, and they're much better in this film. They're more interesting than the others villains of Marvel's Phase 2 so far, and there's a lot of cool twists revolving around them. The action sequences are terrific, using practical effects whenever the filmmakers are able to and using quality CGI at other times. Iron Man 3 was nothing more than decent, and Thor: The Dark World was a bit of an improvement. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is easily the best film of this phase yet, and if the films themselves along with Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and Samuel L. Jackson's performances continue to get better as they have so far, Avengers: Age of Ultron is something I'm definitely looking forward to.",8,11,20,22 April 2014
Man of Steel," Like watching somebody play a video game
","I would have been disappointed by this film, but having been fairly sure it was going to be bad, I wasn't. I simply didn't expect it to be this awful.Other than Henry Cavill, who is a great Superman, the cast is abysmal. Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, and especially Michael Shannon are all as bland as a rice cake soaked in water. Laurence Fishburne and Diane Keaton can act well enough, but their characters have very little to do or say that is interesting. Russell Crowe's Jor-El is like a sleepy Ben Kenobi, saying all the predictable 'wise' things you would expect. The action and the camera-work of this film is like watching a toddler play a video game, just ravaging the joystick in his hands hoping for something to happen.The individual positive qualities of the creative team cease to exist in this film, they must have cancelled each other out.",2,9,16,19 November 2013
Van Helsing," A childhood favorite that I still enjoy
","As is the norm with the films of Stephen Summers, the CGI is mostly lackluster, with Dracula's bat children being the worst example of the special effects. On the other hand, the production and costume design is very good, from the leather coats to the corsets. Gothic castles and scientific equipment are showcased throughout, with actual antiques being used in the opening.Van Helsing is certainly a more stoic and serious lead hero than Rick O'Connell of Sommers' Mummy films, and Dracula is a much more talkative and performance-wise over the top villain than Imhotep. Hugh Jackman does a good job as Van Helsing, and his arsenal of cool gadgets don't hurt either. The worst characters are Dracula's brides, who are rather annoying and are given most of the worst lines in the film.It's reminiscent of Castlevania, with a one-time-use objects that helps the heroes out and Dracula turning into a large demonic creature for the final battle. Sommers clearly likes the Universal horror films of the 30s and 40s, and rather than trying to do a film in that exact style and tone, he simply took various elements of them and adapted them into an action adventure film (as he did with The Mummy), and it works for the most part.",7,1,3,23 May 2015
Ender's Game," Fairly good
","I read the book about a year and a half before the film adaptation of Ender's Game was released, and having liked the book, I was skeptical the film was going to be any good upon receiving the news that it would be director by the same man who directed X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but I ended up liking the movie.I change the movie made from the book that I actually prefer is increasing Ender's age, his actions and ways of speaking just seem more appropriate coming from a kid the age he is in the film rather than a kid the age he is in the book. A major subplot from the book is dropped entirely, and while this subplot was great in the book, I think dropping it for the movie was necessary, as all it consisted of was two people using computers, which would be fairly uncinematic and tedious to watch.Asa Butterfield is pretty good in the lead role of Ender, but Harrison Ford is merely OK as Colonel Graff, he just sort of growls his way through the part. The supporting cast of kids is all around good, though some of them are a bit underused. The musical score isn't bad, but highly forgettable. Overall, good, but not great. Depending on how big a fan you are of the book will certainly affect your opinion of the film, and as a casual fan of the book, I liked the movie.",7,0,1,23 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-Cellent
","This movie elevates the whole series by both being a great film on its own and by brilliantly tying all the films closer together, paying homage to them, building on the events that have taken place, and giving us the answers to several questions that have been building up as the series went on. With a great cast and characters, a clever screenplay, and impressive direction, X-Men: Days of Future Past is the best film in the series yet.Film series generally put an emphasis on one character above the rest, and for the X-Men series this character was Wolverine. Having two solo spin-offs about him and having been the main character of all the films except First Class, Wolverine is still a main character, but part of what now truly feels like an ensemble: Wolverine, Mystique, Professor X, and Magneto all have equal focus in this movie. I don't fault the previous X-Men films for not being an ensemble of the same level, as it's perfectly normal to have a primary focus on one character in particular and most of the movies did have great casts, but I do feel Days of Future Past makes the best use of its cast yet.We get to see quite a few familiar faces, such as Storm, Kitty Pryde, Iceman, and Colossus in the future, and Beast, Havok, and Toad in the past. Some are major supporting roles and others are mere cameos, but it's nice to see these characters again and to see most of the cast members reprise their roles. There are also several new characters. Like the returning ones, some aren't as prevalent as others, but all are distinct and stand out in their own way.The amount of continuity errors in the X-Men series continued to increase as it went on, and this film manages to correct most of them. We now know why Xavier was able to walk at times after his paralyzation and why Beast looked like a normal person in X2, and the change of the series' timeline provides future opportunity to fix most of the remaining errors, as the events have all been changed now. This change in the timeline doesn't mean that the events of the previous films of the series no longer matter, as they directly lead to the story of Days of Future Past and are still remembered by Wolverine. Days of Future Past pays homage to every X-Men film, and all remain important to the series as it continues.",9,2,3,20 June 2014
Alien vs. Predator," Decent
","The biggest issue with the film is the inconsistent depiction of the Predators. We know they need to hunt in a hot climate, yet all of the sudden they're in Antarctica of all places? They're far less intelligent too, and outright dumb in some instances. The characters are all kinda mediocre, although there are a few good exchanges of dialogue.On the positive side of things, the action sequences are pretty good, and the setting of an underground pyramid is imaginative. The depiction of the Alien Queen is very cool, and the scene where she breaks free from her icy shackles is my favorite in the film.Overall, it's a fairly entertaining movie in spite of its flaws. This had the potential to be a lot better, but as evidenced by the sequel Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, it also could've been far worse.",7,0,0,19 March 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The first great film in the LOTR/Hobbit series
","I find The Lord of the Rings films quite dull on the whole. They have their moments, but overall I have no interest in seeing any of them ever again. Unlike those films, The Desolation of Smaug is actually quite fun and exciting. Bilbo is a much better protagonist than Frodo was, he has much more charisma and likability. Sequences like the barrel ride are quite fun, and Smaug is an amazing villain, by far the best one in any of these films. Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job for the motion capture with his voice and mannerisms, I was fascinated by every movement the creature made and every word he said. Peter Jackson compared Smaug to Hannibal Lector if he were a dragon, and that's not far off. Howard Shore's score isn't bad, but it is forgettable.Haven't seen The Battle of the Five Armies yet, but the quality of this movie gives me more hope for it than I would've had previously.",8,2,4,16 January 2015
Man on the Moon," An interesting and funny look at an interesting and funny man
","Like most of the world, I was introduced to Andy Kaufman through the sitcom Taxi, where he played a goofy foreigner mechanic named Latka Gravas. Given his comedy style on the show, I would never have guessed what a different approach he took to most of his comedy in real life.Jim Carrey, a fan of Andy Kaufman, is great as Andy, and Andy's alternate persona Tony Clifton. The script is written by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, writers of biopics Ed Wood and The People vs. Larry Flynt. Like in Ed Wood, humor is used as often as possible as the story moves forward. Danny DeVito (Kaufman's co-star on Taxi) plays Kaufman's manager George Shapiro, and also produced the film. With the exception of Tony Danza (who had a rather strong dislike for Kaufman and felt it would be disingenuous to appear in a film about him), all of the cast members of Taxi make appearances.This is far from a perfectly factual movie, many events and circumstances portrayed in the film are highly fictionalized and sometimes appear out of order. But while the events portrayed aren't entirely accurate, they aren't meant to be, and the film remains quite true to the spirit of Andy Kaufman.I recommend this film quite a bit, for both fans and non-fans of Andy Kaufman.",8,2,2,20 February 2014
Frozen," Happy to say it didn't leave me cold
","The soundtrack to this movie has been wildly praised, and I mostly agree with the reaction it's gotten. The only songs I didn't like were 'In Summer' and 'Fixer Upper', particularly the latter due to the fact that Anna and Kristoff just let the trolls waste time singing this song even though they know Anna is being frozen. 'Let It Go' has gotten the most praise of all the songs, and I must say I totally agree with the reaction this song has gotten. It's fantastic, and right up there with my favorite Disney songs.Kristen Bell does a great job voicing Anna, she's perky and determined. Bell is the most famous person of the cast, and she suits the character well enough so that the movie doesn't just become a 'spot the celebrity voice' game like The Lion King (Hey, it's Matthew Broderick...James Earl Jones...Nathan Lane). I enjoyed how Elsa was more or less the 'villain' of the first half of the movie, and wasn't somebody who had bad intentions but was just in a bad situation, so I was a little disappointed when Hans was revealed as a more traditional villain. I really don't like Olaf, he's just not that great of a character and I think he could've pretty easily been left out of the movie.It overall isn't one of Disney's best animated movies, but it's still quite good due to it's voice cast and the majority of the soundtrack, especially 'Let It Go'.",6,3,17,24 April 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Lazily pieced together
","After seeing Peter's parents die in an action sequence you'd see in a low tier Bond film, we see Spider-Man battle a villain who seems like he'd be more suited to chasing Rocky and Bullwinkle. Once that villain is in check, we move on to Max Dillon, whose villainous potential is made clear in a scene straight out of Analyze This. The insecure nerd then gets electrical superpowers, and swears a vendetta against Spider-Man because he didn't recognize him right off the bat.Damn. Well, who wouldn't, right?The worst part of this movie is the villains. Fearless Leade-uh, I meant the Rhino, is just a cringeworthy cartoon cheeseball. Electro is probably the 'best' villain of the movie, faint praise as that is. He has practically no motivation, but at least he's visually interesting. The Green Goblin looks like the lovechild of Johnny Rotten and a troll doll, and he arrives literally seconds after Electro is defeated. That's just extremely lazy writing.Andrew Garfield isn't that compelling or likable of a lead, although he's not terrible. He does have some chemistry with Emma Stone. The brighter aesthetics are more suitable for a Spider-Man film, a welcome change from the Batman-like aesthetics of The Amazing Spider-Man.Spider-Man 3 also had a few coincidences in the storyline, but that film was still entertaining and had well-performed and depicted characters. Unlike this film, its merits outweighed its faults.",4,3,8,25 March 2015
Grudge Match," Better than I expected
","I had heard mostly negative things about this movie, so I went into it with fairly low expectations and ended up enjoying the movie. I had a similar experience with another 2013 film of De Niro's, 'The Family'.The movie's concept pretty much sells itself, it's Rocky vs. Raging Bull, the stars of the biggest boxing movies ever come together in a comedy about two rival boxers having one more fight thirty years past their prime. Stallone and De Niro are both pretty funny, and Kevin Hart and Alan Arkin are good in their supporting roles. Kim Basinger is just kind of there, her character has her place in the story but isn't particularly funny or memorable.This isn't the kind of movie that keeps you on your toes or anything like that, it's a bit generic and the appeal of it is the novelty of seeing Stallone and De Niro together in a boxing movie, but it's still amusing and I'm not really sure what you can point to in it that makes it awful. De Niro has been criticized a fair amount over the past decade, with people saying that he's tarnishing his career with the movies he's been making recently. While I do think some of his movies have been quite awful (Little Fockers, for example), I highly doubt he'll ever tarnish his career. I've never met anyone who thinks of New Years Eve before Taxi Driver when thinking of De Niro, so I say let him do what he wants with his movies.I recommend this movie. It isn't mandatory viewing, but it is enjoyable and better than its reputation suggests.",7,0,0,21 April 2014
Caddyshack," Classic comedy
","This movie is but one of several classic comedies crafted by Harold Ramis, the man responsible for National Lampoon's Animal House, Stripes, National Lampoon's Vacation, Ghostbusters, Back to School, and Groundhog Day. The performances are all around great, my favorite of them being Ted Knight's portrayal as the straight man, his reactions to the outrageous actions of Rodney Dangerfield's character are always hilarious. Chevy Chase plays a cocky golfer with a pseudo-Buddist take on things, and listening to him converse with other characters is never boring and always funny. The slapstick antics of the groundskeeper played by Bill Murray are very inventive and funny as he attempts to kill the silly- looking gopher.My only real criticism of this movie is that it's somewhat unfocused, sometimes focusing on the hilarious antics of the golfers and caddies, and other times it focuses on a love story that feels kind of unfinished and is not told very well. It isn't a major problem, as the film is still mostly about the humor, but it is noticeable. That aside, I highly recommend this film for its gags, performances, and great quotes.",9,1,2,2 May 2013
Sinister," Pretty Good
","First of all, I just want to say that I'm glad I didn't know who directed this before I saw it (directed by the man behind the remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still), and if I had known, I wouldn't have even given it a look.However, I'm glad that I did see it, because this movie has a number of great aspects that have more or less disappeared in recent years regarding horror films. The best thing about the movie is the brilliant musical score. It is creepy, and captures the tone of the movie very well, exactly what a great horror film score should do (see Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street). I also liked the villain of the film. I won't say who (or what) he is, but he's somebody everybody has been scared of at some point in their childhood, and the film does a good job building him up.Ethan Hawke does well in the main role, and James Ransone and Vincent D'Onofrio are good in their supporting roles. There are a few silly scenes, like when the ghost children are running around the house, and the last shot of the movie is very predictable, but overall the film does a very good job with its creepy atmosphere, good characters, and excellent score.",8,1,2,9 March 2013
Carrie," Strong middle
","The first half hour of this is really weak. It's hard to connect or sympathize with Carrie because we just don't get to know her enough to like her, in all her scenes here she's either acting weird or being tormented by her cartoon mother (I can't believe Piper Laurie got an Oscar nomination for this), and the Nancy Allen character's hatred of her isn't really believable. I like Brian De Palma all right, but subtlety definitely isn't his forte. But once we get past this and Tommy asks her out, the movie gets a lot better, we actually get to spend some time with Carrie and get invested in her. Everything for the next 40 minutes is very compelling, from the slaughtering of the pigs to the prom, and the suspense in the scene where the bucket of blood teeters over her head is just great. During the last 20 minutes when Carrie gets her revenge, a lot of scenes seem really dragged out, especially when Carrie gets to her house and heads for the tub.",7,0,2,23 August 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A big step up from Man of Steel
","There's still a lot of destruction here, but it's not as pointless and I really appreciated that Superman actually makes a major attempt to avoid any civilian casualties this time around, instead of just throwing his enemies into whatever building is nearest. The new cast members are really good too, especially Affleck, Irons, and Gadot (even though she has a fairly small role, what we see of her is great). Amy Adams also improved and Henry Cavill is as good as he ever was. There's an excess of scattered subplots in the first hour or so, but it's still entertaining for the most part, and it picks up more as it continues. Hans Zimmer also did a surprisingly good score, given how much I had disliked his work on Man of Steel and the previous Batman films, though I suppose Junkie XL did it with him. Wonder Woman's theme in particular is awesome. Action's fair for the most part, though Snyder just won't let go of his beloved slow mo... Still, there are good sequences, especially the warehouse sequence with Batman.",7,2,4,26 March 2016
Signs," I saw Signs, and it made me wanna claw out my eyes! I saw Signs!
","People always told me this was M. Night Shyamalan's last good movie before he infamously hit the wall. Though I haven't seen The Last Airbender or After Earth (and probably never will), I consider Signs his worst movie.The acting isn't very good, but the screenplay gives them nothing to work with. None of the characters do or say anything remotely close to actual human behavior, and Shyamalan as a director also fails to salvage this cast.I'm not the first to say it and I rightfully won't be the last, but my God is the twist a slap in the face. It's what pushes this to simply being a bad movie to an offensive movie. It insults my intelligence, and makes me wish I hadn't even watched this piece of garbage.",3,3,6,20 June 2014
Godzilla," A great return for the King of the Monsters
","As a huge fan of the Toho Godzilla films, I'm glad to say I really enjoyed this.First and foremost, Godzilla himself is awesome. He's partially seen immediately after the opening credits, and a scene soon after takes place inside the skeleton of a member of his species. This builds up his first full appearance well, getting us excited to see him. It takes a while to happen, but his arrival is spectacular. The MUTOs are fairly well done, despite not being particularly original (most obvious is their hatching from a cocoon, a classic Mothra trait), but they do pose a threat to humanity effectively and make good enemies for Godzilla, and those are the most important things.Aaron Taylor-Johnson's acting is just OK, but it's made up for by giving his character a lot to do. For Elizabeth Olsen, it's the opposite, her character doesn't have much to do, but Olsen's acting is very good. Bryan Cranston gives the best performance in the film, the highlight of his acting being when his character shouts in demand to know what's really going on.I was a little frustrated by the many cutaways just when some monster action was about to begin, but the epic final battle makes up for it. Now that I've seen this movie once and know my issues after being so excited to see it, I think this is the type of film that could very likely get even better with rewatches.And how can you not love the way Godzilla kills the female MUTO?",7,2,5,26 May 2014
Fantastic Four," Room for improvement
","This is one of those movies where you can tell that all they needed was just one more draft of the screenplay written to get it right. If they had done this, I definitely think this film could be deserving of a 7/10, but as it is, it's a 5/10.The biggest problem is that the odds are so uneven, we have four heroes, but only one villain. Hardly fair. Another villain should've been included to even out the odds a little, or perhaps just give Dr. Doom an arsenal of robots that he could use to combat the Fantastic Four. Granted, Doom probably is the most powerful character in the film, but four slightly less powerful beings fighting against him still makes it seem an overly one-sided match.The second problem is the execution of the comedy. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love a sense of humor in superhero films, and I don't care for hyper-serious ones with no self-awareness, superhero films of which type have been getting more prominent over the past few years. But the issue in Fantastic Four is that so much of the comedy is just done poorly, all this bad humor culminating in a horrific montage.The film definitely has positive qualities, all the characters are very well-cast, especially Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans. The visual effects are also a treat, the uses of each character's superpower is very well-done and the sequence in space where the characters gain their abilities is very cool.Overall, mediocre. Not terrible, but not good either. The sequel was definitely better.",5,0,3,11 February 2014
