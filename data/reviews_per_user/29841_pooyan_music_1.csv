It," A Horrifying Monster at the beginning... A Stupid pinata At the End!!!!
",There was absolutely no originality and creativity in this movie! they just hide behind the fact that its a remake so all they had to do was to rely on technology to do the job for them!!All the high school stereotypes of bullies and a group of nerd bikers that later on will include a hot bad ass girl that one or all of them have a crush on!!!And of course we have our star Mr creepy clown with a killer and awesome initiating scene at the beginning and all the hide and seeks in the process!!! I think he himself got tired of the movie and told them to just hit him at the end and get it over with!!... i think he even begged for it... i know i did!!!!,4,0,1,15 November 2017
