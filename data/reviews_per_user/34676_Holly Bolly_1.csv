The Rock," This adventure set on Alcatraz stars Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery in one of his less memorable performances.
",This was not the worst movie I've seen but it would not have been worth a full priced movie ticket.  The plot was interesting but far-fetched and the story was full of holes.  The toxic nuclear green balls were kind of hilarious but fun.  I suppose if you don't take this too seriously it is entertaining but don't go looking for a movie to add to the fine credits of Cage and Connery.,6,4,7,16 July 1999
