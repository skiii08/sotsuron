The Avengers," Even with some flaws, excellent and one of the best movies of Marvel Heroes
","I'll make it simple:Best points: Action scenes, Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man, HulkLow points: Captain AmericaI went to see this movie in 2D because i don't like the 3D, but after awhile i was regretting it because the scenes are awesome and must be really great in 3D, even in 2D the Heroes and creatures seem to come inside the cinema.Captain America is so wrongly portrayed here, it's a mix of the old one of the comics in the 60's with the new one of Civil War, when the best comics of Captain America were in the 80's and 90's, he's supposed to be a man, not a kid, he's supposed to have a strong voice, not a sweet women lovable voice, he's supposed to be a bulk, not a normal gym guy, he's supposed to have an armor that shows respect and represents dignity, not a plastic suit that looks a carnival suit for kids, he's supposed to throw his shield like it was easy and light for him, and not heavy or with much effort, the shield it's supposed to be an extension of his arm and not his shoulder, He's supposed to be a leader and not someone who tells jokes, he never makes anyone laugh, he's the moral standards of every group, something that no Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, or other hero can do as him, because apart from his serum and special abilities he represents humanity at his best, not a playboy business man, or a God, or a monster, he's representing the best of mankind and human spirit, he's more then a soldier, and last but not least, he never takes a gun and starts shooting! Apart from that(because Captain America is one of my heroes) i can't give a 9 to this movie, all the scenes are great, Loki isn't that good as everyone says here, a god doesn't spit to a glass while talking, you don't even know if gods have saliva, it's not cool, but anyway i think it deserves a 9.5. Because i can't give that, and, although it doesn't respect Captain America spirit right, it's an awesome movie, 10 stars!Best part of the movie is the scene when Hulk starts fighting the bad guys, you won't get better excitement and thrill then this, not even on the Hulk movies, what a shame for those two...",10,6,11,8 May 2012
Super 8," Super 80's! not so super ending...
","After watching this amazing film, i gotta say it was a good job done by JJ, but it's not like people are saying it's perfect, somethings didn't work with this story, it's really amazing the beginning and u get that sense of a good old Spielberg movie(does he make any good one today?) the scenes inside the houses are miracles of transportation to the E.T. time line, god i was missing that kind of movies, sometimes i would think why we don't have that kind of feeling anymore of a cozy safe environment like in the E.T. and in Close Encounters of The Third Kind, well in that point of view this movie is perfect, it brings u that epic feeling of aliens are good, military are bad(so Spielberg), but the problem of this movie not being good as E.T. or Close Encounters, is that u never get to know the alien and the military so much so u can understand what's going on, and the magic disappears in the end, making this movie only a simple one, with not much meaning, cus the director doesn't focus the story on the two kids, or the friends, or the family, or the alien and the military, and it's a mix of everything, and it's a mix of nothing, OK it's not that bad, this are just a few of the things i think were missing, but honestly i don't like JJ that much, it almost feel that JJ is doing with Spielberg what Tarantino did with Sergio Leone, copying the environment and scenes it's not the same as the real deal, Spielberg is much better then JJ directing as SÃ©rgio Leone is of Tarantino, the kids will like this movie cus it's not so complicated to them, it will be a movie for the kids with the same age as the ones in the movie, but it has some epic scenes this one, but back to JJ, i didn't like Cloverfield, i thought the ending ruined the film for me, it was one of the most dumb and easy endings to make, it ruins all the experience, the same happens with this one, if the ending would unveil something about the story, really give it a meaning like something happening to the kid's dad, or his 'girlfriend', something that would give u a last 'awh' and a last grasp of air, but no, JJ (witch is amazing filming this film) gives it a Cloverfield ending, a numb dumb ending, non-emotional, and i won't even criticize the alien, because it seams lots of people, in some weird way of 'how did we let this go wrong', seam to like this kind of monsters instead of the aliens of E.T. and Close Encounters, if it wasn't for the simple wrap-up ending i would never have written something here, i would have gone home with a happy smile on my face and would have thought of seeing it again, but like this i just want to see E.T. and Close Encounters again to believe again in intelligent life in outer space, and when u already understood u were in the 80's again it wasn't necessary to send a ship to the sky to makes feel again like kids saying goodbye to E.T., it doesn't work, especially not in that way... Good awesome movie to honor Spielberg, but nothing else...",1,1,3,17 June 2011
Centurion," completely ridiculous
","I can't believe people are praising so high this film, the best film Marshall has ever done was The Descent, then he made Doomsday, which doesn't get any near a good science fiction movie, actually copying some of the greatest of all times, then this Centurion which mixes Gladiator and King Artur, creating some kind of gore b movie, with nothing special to hold on, i mean, you can only like this movie if you really are into gore, the argument is one of the worst i ever seen, the mistakes are so bad in this one, OK here goes the spoiler, they're running away of some trackers, and the centurion leaves the general helmet's behind?!!! wtf! the love story is so out of context, and the witch is so beautiful, like a model, that you can hardly understand how she's living alone, and hasn't been raped or been made wife of some leader, not to mention the fact that she looks like she's been living in an hotel for the last couple of years with that make up?! it's completely dumb! then the warriors that are afraid of wolfs?!! they could go up in a tree but no, they run like ladies in distress, and the mere fact that wolfs are afraid of men makes it even more stupid, they don't come out in the open like that. it's just keeps getting stupider and stupider the movie, near the end one of the warriors goes running to the fort, screaming like a woman, with his arms up, when there was no danger, nothing special for that crazy behavior, and get's shot, if the behavior is nonsensical the shooting of the warrior is even more, so a sentinel in his post see's someone approaching alone, with no weapon in sight, screaming in their language, and he just kills him without even seeing if he's friend or foe, great! this one is to be avoid, but the worst is the emotional acting that they want to give to this film, let's face it, this movie is not historical, it doesn't have good acting, it's just another clone of an adventure war movie, it looks like nobody learned anything with Braveheart, it's a shame for the cinema of today.",1,63,117,14 August 2010
X-Men: First Class," The only movie until now that X-men would like to see
","I simply loved this movie, finally i saw something that i could relate to my childhood comics, i love the X-men and Wolverine, my brother would instead love Spiderman, x-men was what life was all about for me, the difference and accepting difference, tolerance agaisnt others that think and are different of you, this movie has all of it, but more, it show us character dept in a way that even Hugh Jackman never did, i love wolverine and i prefer the actor that made magneto in this movie, the ending is one of the best, u can even empathize with Magneto in the ending speech, i mean, u understand and u can relate with the bad guy! it almost lurches u into his side, i think half of the x-men fans agree with him and half agree with charles, the heroes are amazing and even not having such great powers u prefer those heroes to Harry Potter friends, or Twilight vampires and werewolfs, and the bad ass of this film Shaw? it's so great what kevin does with him, the way he acts the villain, i mean, i never given a damn to Shaw, i thought he wasn't that powerful, never understand his importance and now i can understand he's truly something, but the geniality behind all this is the story behind Magneto, his character is the best, the scene in the bar should embarrass Tarantino 'Inglorious Bastards', just thought the queen of Hellfire should have been played by a better actress, but anyway, definitely way better then the other X-Men movies, it should have started with this one, cause in this one they respect the characters, it's not a bunch of good looking kids showing up to be heroes, this heroes are real good actors, and it shows in every second of the movie, looking back on the other movies they seem so bad compared to this one, Brian Singer for me is not a good director, this one is starting to be a great one, i just hope they do the same with Wolverine what they did with X-Men, cus i didn't like Wolverine movie either, and i hope, even though i loved Magneto character in this one(i hated him in all the others, it was simply bad) i want to see another foe, Magneto is not the only foe of X-Men, how is it possible that with 5 movies about X-Men and Wolverine, we didn't got to see Apocalipse or Sinister? it's an imperial that the next movie has one of those, even if Magneto is so damn good in this one! For me the only X-Men movie so far, u can burn the others...",10,3,8,17 June 2011
