Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Bad Ethnic Joke
","This movie is a bad ethnic joke. It depicts Kazaks in particular, and in general all people not raised in the United States, as ignorant, racist, sexist, abusive people (In fairness, it does depict some Americans as being equally disgusting.). I have spend time with people from many parts of the world, and have friends who live abroad. They and I have encountered the full range of attitudes we have here in the US, from the most racist and sexist to the most egalitarian and altruistic. This film does a disservice to both Americans and Kazaks. I did chuckle a couple of times, but got no good belly laughs as promised, and was more often disgusted by the scenes in this film.",1,17,36,6 November 2006
