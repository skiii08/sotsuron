Blade Runner 2049," Good visual effects, but lacks of everything else
","The music was horrible, didn't let me focus on the film at all, it was confusing, evoked some feelings that were completely the opposite of what was happening on the film. The music threw me off completely. Horrible job. The visual effects were nice, the acting from Ryan Gosling was very nice too. Harrison Ford was lacking throughout his whole part.
I was happy to see Ana de Armas perform so well, so props to that.
The storyline didn't have any depth either. So 2/10.",7,0,2,10 July 2018
3:10 to Yuma," Every man has good in his heart
","This film shows perfectly how, when necessary, even the most feared of men can show compassion, if it means achieving a greater good. I particularly liked the scene where Christian Bale tells Russel Crowe how he lost his leg, and why he should transport him safely to the train. Because it's not about the money. It's about his whole life and how he's suffered with shame and fear.",7,1,2,11 July 2018
The Equalizer," Good guy with almost superpowers
","Some people say this movie has zero story, I disagree, our beloved Denzel Washington is playing the role of a person with a big heart that helps people in need. What more story do you need? Very nice film, I always wanted to see bad people suffering in movies and good people succeeding.",8,0,2,13 August 2018
Gravity," Great special effects, poor storyline
","The storyline was too linear in my opinion. There was nothing unpredictable about the film, except the end. I never thought she would survive Earth's re-entry, and realistically, she shouldn't have following the trajectory she did. But I am happy nonetheless. Special effects are very nice, but watching it a second time after five years, where I've seen many more films, has made me re-evaluate some things I liked and don't anymore.",5,0,0,14 August 2018
The Princess Bride," True Love is a real thing
","This movie showed me what true love is. Without fear or limits, true love is powerful and very rare. Westley and Buttercup luckily found it. It is and always will be one of my favorite movies because it represents the purity of the human being. Something that nowadays doesn't happen, in my opinion.",9,0,0,9 July 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Probably the best father-son conversation I've heard in my life, including my own.
","The movie was incredible. When I think about watching it, the thing that is most stuck in my head is the conversation between Elio and his father about life and its freedom and uniqueness.The film has an extremely depressing ending. Which I hate, but I can't help but love at the same time. Movies are made to evoke emotions, and this movie sure did.",10,6,12,12 August 2018
Don't Breathe," Very scary, had to watch most of the film on low volume
","The film is very scary. I always rooted for the thieves, so I guess the story is well written, as I don't usually like antagonists. But who knows, everyone is a bad person in this movie. The suspense is very well created with the lighting and silences. However, I don't think a blind man has the type of capabilities that the old man has. I give it a 6.",6,0,0,10 July 2018
Sicario," Very intense, entertaining and emotional
","Unlike many movies, I didn't get tired at the middle of it. Benicio del Toro and Emily Blunt were both incredible. I hope Sicario 2 does justice this year.",10,1,2,13 July 2018
Man on Fire," It showed me how good a man can be
","Altruism is a gift that only a few have. This film is a clear example of a good man, 'a sheep that got lost'. The performances by Dakota Fanning, Denzel Washington and Radha Mitchell were incredible, in my opinion. Christopher Walken didn't appear as much as I had expected; it's a shame he wanted to help on everything but kill. I would've liked to see him angry for once.",9,0,0,8 July 2018
Whiplash," 10/10
","Excellent movie. I loved both J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller's performances. The movie is so relatable for people like me, that undergo daily stress and hard mental work. Andrew seems like a likeable guy with a bright future that has to make tough decisions, and I love how he manages his life.",10,0,0,22 August 2018
Flight," Great movie with a moral imperative
","Although most people watch the movie for the flight scene, I find most interesting the struggle of Mr. Whitaker to stay on his feet during the whole federal trial process. I was hoping for him to lie at the end, as I wanted him to be unpunished, for some reason. Probably because throughout the whole movie I identified with his struggles personally.",9,3,5,13 August 2018
