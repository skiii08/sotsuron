Black Swan," Confusion
","Just watched last night. It began decently, continued in a strange way, and ended mysteriously. The female protagonist was a pain in the balls in every scene... this does not mean that the actress did not do her job well. Masochism, mental issues, sexual identity issues, homicide, suicide - way too complex for a unique movie.",6,0,1,20 September 2017
