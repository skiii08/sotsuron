The King's Speech," Finally, the stutterers were given the respect they deserve!
","When I heard about this movie I really got anxious to see him, but I couldn't. Then I heard that it had been nominated for the Oscars, and later won 4 including Best Picture. At the time that I was sad about it (especially because Inception had also been nominated). But months went by and I finally could see the movie ... and the Oscar was more than deserved!'The King's Speech' is a simply powerful movie in every detail. Tom Hooper manages to give a fantastic direction in the film, and the images and scenarios that he uses are impressive builds the film by every minute that passes. But the strongest point of the movie it really is the superb story. It's the biopic that tells the story of how King George VI (Colin Firth), the father of Queen Elizabeth II, overcame his stuttering problem. Being considered incapable by everyone except for his father to be king.George is reluctantly thrust to the throne after his brother David (Guy Pearce) is forced to abdicate. Overshadowed on the global stage by powerful orators like Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the King relies on the help of a little known Australian therapist, named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to find his voice and boldly lead his people to mankind more devastating war has ever faced.The film manages to deliver a powerful, hilarious and poignant story, said against the backdrop of a critical moment in modern history. All thanks to the screenplay by David Seidler which is excellent. The British dry humor that David adds to the film's hilarious and fits perfectly in the movie. Placing an amazing reality on the characters, we see for the 1st time that the royal people are human beens like any other normal people with their own personal problems as anyone. Geoffrey Rush does a fantastic job, as well Helena Bonham Carter (as the wife of King George). But the shining star is Colin Firth, is EXCELLENT in every detail perfect giving a stutterer, and a very relatable character.The build up to the final climax is skillfully executed and led the audience to burst into applauds. That took this movie, as I call, a 'INSTANT CLASSIC'.",9,2,4,15 April 2013
The Avengers," Finally
","This film was expected since 2008 with the movie Hulk (movie more or less), since Marvel has promised the film 'THE AVENGERS', the famous group of super heroes (basically, the Justice League Marvel). Then came the movies Iron Man (2008-Great), Iron Man 2 (2009-Good) Thor (2010-Good) Captain America (2011-Very Good), and finally in 2012 came the expected and exceeded all expectations!A film that brought together four powerful super heroes (and 2 that appeared in the movie Iron Man 2 and Thor), with all the elements of a superhero film. And who directs it all? Joss Weedon, nerd-director, best direction for a superhero film there it's not (except for Nolan, 'THE DARK KNIGHT'). He took the heroes and their BDs, took Manhattan (the stage of all superhero movies), and with a little touch of realism and pum ... 'THE AVENGERS' born.Managed to put together a fantastic action, die laughing humor, and even a bit of emotion, and the most impressive are the heroes. All were perfect in their roles, and each had their moment in the film, it didn't had a main character, all leading heroes in the film are- For example, when Iron Man appears it is all about him, when Hulk appears everything it is about him, and that's with all the characters. But to understand the story better, it's kind of mandatory watch the other films that I mentioned earlier. But you can see the same movie and love it completely.After THE DARK KNIGHT trilogy, THE AVENGERS is the best superhero film ever made.",8,0,4,15 April 2013
Black Swan," Best....ballet movie....ever made (with some scary ass sh#t!
","Director Darren Aronofsky that already had presented us: the disturbing and broken world of drug users in 'Requiem for a Dream'; the connection of different lives at different times; made us cry and laugh with the life of a retired wrestler. And now with 'Black Swan' not only he wanted to show the world the actress that Natalie Portman is, but also wanted to scare us mentally from start to finish in this fabulous film.'Black Swan' tells the story of Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) a dear and innocent New Yorker ballerina that, like all in this business, dreams to shine on stage and perhaps achieve perfection in dance. One day Nina's life changes when her art teacher Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) gives her the leading role in his remastering of the play 'The Swan Lake' which is the Swan Queen (that actually consists in two roles, the White Swan and the Black Swan). But Thomas thinks that Nina as the White Swan is perfect, capturing the grace and innocence of the character. But not as the Black Swan that requires malice and sensuality. Qualities that another dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) manages to convey in the dance, impressing Thomas. So now the two girls begin a contradictory friendship expanding their rivalry. But with this Nina gets to know her malicious and cruel side, which can destroy her terribly inside and as a person, or perhaps help her incorporate the role of the Black Swan.If you know the story of the 'Swan Lake' then maybe it can be a spoiler for the story...... if you have the mentality strength to see it. Darren Aronofsky didn't participate this time the script giving the job to Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John J. McLaughlin, but nothing is lost, but personified. The writing from start to finish creates a great metaphor in the film involving the story of 'Swan Lake' and the life of Nina.Nina is the innocent White Swan trapped in her world wanting to somehow break free. And when she meets the gentleman Thomas he gives her a chance to shine, replacing the dying swan Beth (Winona Ryder) in the role. But it becomes impossible when the malicious Black Swan Lily steals everyone's attention with his guile and sexuality. Now Nina has only her friend and mother the swan queen Erica (Barbara Hershey) to aid her.But not only is the metaphor of the story in the narrative shines in the film, but suddenly the script takes the film to a dark and terrifying side. That happened when Nina meets Lily which is clearly Nina's opposite: she lies, makes fun of people, and of course uses her sensuality to her advantage. Things that Nina had never been able to be or do, and strikes up a friendship with her rival to might try to find her malicious and sexy side, but it starts to bring great dangers with disturbing visions and changes of attitudes. That's where the terrifying dialogs shown concepts that we all have a dark and evil side in each one of us. Not only in dialogs that this is shown, but also in the magnificent direction.The direction of Aronofsky has never been so great as it is here. Yes I know, 'Requiem' had that depressing and disturbing tone. And in 'Wrestler' he put us in the place of Randy both walking the streets as faking a fight in the ring. But here is a little bit of both, not only putting us in places that Nina goes in her home or on stage during the show, but also dark and disturbing moments where Aronofsky uses the perfect use of a beautiful cinematography and (surprisingly) visual effects (which helps in the most beautiful, creepy and metaphorical scene in the movie).The entire cast is fantastic: Winona Ryder as always superb; Vincent Cassel as always with that British air challenger and cocky; Mila Kunis with a good level of performance. But as I said earlier, who stands out is and Natalie Portman, from start to finish simply phenomenal.Many may disagree, but I believe that this movies is so far Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece. 'Black Swan' with its metaphors about the fight between our good and evil side within the play of 'Swan Lake', along with an engaging script and brilliant-terrifying direction with the phenomenal performance of Natalie Portman manages to stand out as a masterpiece of this generation.10/10",10,1,5,20 October 2013
3:10 to Yuma," Good old classic Western is back!
","The James Mangold's film is a tense and traditional Western, based on the 1957 movie with the same title. Mangold simply brings back the good old Western of old full of points needed to make it radiant.In the story we see Dan Evans (Christian Bale) and Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). Evans is an alleged farmer whose family is suffering from a drought and a ruthless landlord. Evans and his son intersect with the notorious outlaw Ben Wade and his gang on his way to town to face his landlord, and Wade just let it go. But the connection between these two men and the older son of Dan, it's far from over. Dan eventually accept an offer made by an agent of the railroad to help escort Wade to a train headed to Yuma prison, while the dangerous gang of Wade follows them at every step. With great action scenes, with the Western style, with several twists that anyone, even I wasn't waiting for, with lush landscapes, and we see the relationship of the characters grow throughout the film, a relationship of hatred, respect and friendship. With two fantastic actors. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe simply kill their roles in making them so real and true Western Mans.3:10 to Yuma is a movie with the old Western, with all the elements necessary, an Badass shooter (check); a man looking for justice and redemption (check); an outlaw gang with blood-lust(check); BADASS and epic old western gunfight in a city with the clock chinking (check, check and check)!",8,0,0,15 April 2013
Skyfall," Best James Bond movie??? I don't now, but probably.
","50 years, 24 films (some classics, some fun, some horrible), and finally on his 50th birthday, James Bond deliver's, in what many say is his best movie of all time, and there is much to prove it. After the weak movie that was 'Quantun of Solace', the 007 has been absent for 4 years, many thought it would last forever, but finally in 2012 thanks to Sam Mendes, James Bond had his respect long lost, back and big.'Skyfall' is the 007 movie that we deserve, it gave us a true spectacle that has long not been seen. Joint elements of the old classic James Bond films, we see a bit of 'Dr. No', 'Goldfinger', 'The man with the golden pistol', 'Goldneye', 'Casino Royale'.We see a James Bond more mature and realistic, but at the same time with the classic elements of old movies (the little tools and the jokes are mild examples). Daniel Craig is better than ever was, proving to be one of the best actors of James Bond; Javier Barden is a very clever and cruel villain, one of the best (if not the best) James Bond villains ever had. But I must mention that I see in 'Skyfall' a lot of elements from 'The Dark Knight', the villain is an example, all the movements of the hero were planned by the villain, and the main threat is part of a much larger plan (and even some scenes, but I will not spoil anything).'Skyfall' proves that James Bond is immortal and has much more to deliver, Sam Mendes saved the franchise and I hope he direct's the many others that are yet to come.",9,2,7,15 April 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Dan dandan Daannn....dandandandan....dan dandan Daannn...dandandandan dandan Dandandan...dandandan...dan!
","Professor Indiana Jones was introduced to the world here, and thanks to the genius of George Lucas and the fantastic direction of the legendary Steven Spielberg, it will be remembered forever. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was the masterpiece who not only launched the legendary saga of adventure and the fantastic history of the unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), but also invented the cinema's entertainment, all thanks to a revolutionized and classic story! Early on we see this man who seems to be a cowboy (cowboy hat, a revolver, a whip, daah). We see him and a small group of Latinos venturing in the jungles of South America, soon the audience knows that he is searching for an ancient treasure entering into a cave. There he is faced with several decaying corpses and discovers that the whole room is full of traps. After getting out the golden statue of his precious place, he burst out run and we received the classic chase scene of a huge round stone. After our hero get-away, but he just falls into another deadly trap by a competitor. Our hero escapes again, and later we discoveres that the movie story takes place on the year of 1936, before the second Great War, and our hero is called Indiana Jones and he is a professor and archaeologist who works for a museum. Then, Jones learns about a biblical artifact called 'The Ark of the Covenant' from the healer of the museum and also discovers that this artifact might hold the key to human existence and the powers of god. Now Jones embarks on this adventure to great places ranging from the mountains of Nepal to the deserts of Egypt with the help of his former lover Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). However, he will have to fight against his competitor Renee Belloq (Paul Freeman) and an army of Nazis in order to reach it.The whole story since the very beginning became a classic thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's writing improving by every minute of the film, delivering great dialog explanations of the historical artifacts in the film are very realistic and very simple, leaving the viewer feeling pretty smart. Not only with artifacts explanations that the scripts stands out, but delivers us several humoristic moments with a really smart and fun humor, full of cultural references of the time of the story. But not only humor that makes and revolutionize the movie, but is the change of tone, giving really dark and serious moments to Indi's journey across the globe.Speaking of Indi again, that is another character made by Lucas and starring Harrison Ford that sticks in our minds forever. While in the 'Star Wars' trilogy we have the funny and unforgettable Lando, here like I said before we have professor Indiana Jones badass, smart and once again unforgettable. Both of then became legendary, but Indi is the one that we never had seen before, and till today makes you think. At that time, people never had seen a hero that is a human like any other, getting punched; shoot at; throw at a river of snakes, by every passing minute, but always getting out of the situations full of scars and bleeding. And Indi is a character that make's humor and jokes of the situations that he is presented (not like Lando who delivers badass phrases by every minute).The script (considered one of the best ever written for a film) is excellent, but in technical aspects the movie is marvelous. Spielberg's direction nor comments, delivering chase sequences and action scenes that are breathtaking and are extremely fun, and also feeling really realistic. Everything bathed with John William's unforgettable soundtrack that gets stuck in your head forever (and ever since only made Star Wars soundtracks and every single Spielberg movie).A unforgettable classic that began one of the best trilogies ever made and it will live forever, thanks to a marvelous direction of Spielberg; superb writing; unforgettable character with an amazing performance from Ford. The masterpiece that invented cinema's entertainment, but none entertainment movie of today hold a candle close to this beautiful blend of a serious story with James Bond style and 'The Treasure of sierra Madre' quest all with great quality that show's Lucas and Spielberg minds working together is still today considered a adventure's masterpiece.10/10",10,0,1,8 September 2013
Spartacus," Even not writing, Kubrick still awesome!
","Does it possible that the rebel Kubrick could make another masterpiece, even without writing it? 'Spartacus' was the only film in which Kubrick was hired to direct, but he still managed to make another classic masterpiece for his resume.'Spartacus', after 'Ben Hur' is another grand epic in the history of cinema. It doesn't reach his feet's clearly but with Kubrick, the film managed to give a great sense of history and the same time originality. The story, obviously, talks about the slave Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) who was born from a line of slaves under the Roman Empire and one day he came to be a gladiator. But he couldn't take-it anymore so much injustice around him to all the other slaves beginning a gigantic revolution within the powerful Roman Empire that caused major damage into the heart of the empire.While the film can be a good adaptation of the true historical hero that was Spartacus, but what leads to the problem of the film is that with so many characters together, ranging from gladiators to Roman senators, their relationship of them seems to be at the background having little character's developing, even Spartacus himself, but not everything is lost.Dalton Trumbo (script) gives the film an excellent writing and great dialogs between the characters managing to keep the film on a very realistic style (which later served as inspiration for 'Braveheart' and 'Gladiator'). But even with Dalton writing the film, it is obvious that Kubrick rummaged around giving an intriguing human philosophy into the film.This is more clear at one scene with the cruel senator Crassus (Laurence Olivier) talking to his slave Antoninus (Tony Curtis) in an indirect way the definition of what is a slave and their obedience to the master and to Rome, with a dark and somber tone with the Kubrick style. But even with the somber tone and the slave and master philosophy, the film also gives a philosophy to the cause of Spartacus. That their fight for freedom its not only a physical victory, but also a moral one.Not only Kubrick gives the film a great philosophy, but also gives a great direction with fantastic and lush scenery. It also delivers fierce and realistic fighting scenes giving the film a certain brutality (very advanced for its time).'Spartacus' despite the failure on the characters developing it managed to be amazing. A fantastic direction and excellent writing with an intriguing human philosophy alongside with a superb cast full of lecherous performances by Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier and Charles Laughton, 'Spartacus' is one of the most beautiful epics ever made in the cinema history.",9,1,3,9 July 2013
Minority Report," Spielberg is a master at making films of all genres, sci-fi is one of them.
","'Minority Report' is the 4th sci-fi made by master of cinema, and one of the best ever sci-fi's ever made. Like any Spielberg film, from the technical aspects to the direction, everything is fantastic, as the story itself.The film tells the story of a futuristic world in the year 2054, there is a government organization called 'Precrime'. In this organization, the agents with the help of 3 humans with a special gift to see the future and the past called 'Pre-Cogs', can predict all the murders that are going to happen and so arresting the futuristic assassins. When the best agent with a dark and suffered past, John Anderton (Tom Cruise), is accused of a crime he has not committed. John runs away to try to prove his innocence, which seems difficult with the FBI agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) on his trail.The film manages to blend elements of sci-fi with elements of a film noir. Scott Frank and Jon Cohen (screenplay) can make this a fantastic mix and pretty unique, but at the same time during the movie several questions arise about the future and whether it is right to use the 'Pre-Cogs'.Not only writing in the film which is fantastic, but as the direction of Spielberg. Can you make while scenes of drama, it also makes breathtaking action sequences. Along with the extraordinary visual effects that give the film a huge scale.Not only one of the most ambitious films of Spielberg films, but also one of the best sci-fi movies, ever made.",9,0,0,27 April 2013
Chinatown," Best NOIR ever made!
","After masterpieces like 'Knife in the water', 'Repulsion' and 'Rosemary's Baby'. Roman Polanski (one of the best directors who ever lived, and lives), proved to be a competent director and screenwriter in various genres, decided to make a tribute to the genre that he grew up watching, 'Noir', in the best way possible. Doing in my opinion his ultimate masterpiece! 'Chinatown' tells the story of J.J. 'Jake' Gittes (Jack Nicholson), a private detective in L.A., specialized in cases of marriage. One day, he is hired by Evelyn Mulwray, who suspect's of her husband Hollis Mulwray (Darrell Zwerling), the builder of the water supply system of the city, thinking that he is having an affair. Jake then does what he does best with his assistants and follows and takes photos of Hollis with his young lover, inadvertently causing a huge scandal in the press. Later after a job well done, Jake gets into his office the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) putting a process in Jake accusing him of fraud. Jake knowing that he was set-up, he begins to investigate who was the fake Mrs. Mulwray, and trying to get in touch with Hollis Mulwray, because he believe that who cheated him wanted to hurt Mr. Mulwray. Only when Jake tries to contact Mulwray, he is found dead in a channeling of the water system of the city. Now Jake asks the help of the real Mrs. Mulwray to help him in his investigation of those responsible for the death of the poor man, but this will take him into a web of lies and corruption, keeping horrible secrets of the city.Polanski from the beginning wanted to do a tribute to the films noir of the '40s and '50s, and he did it 'perfectly'. First unite the types of cases and scandals of a usual noir film: policy; familial cases; xenophobia and racism; corruption; and of course murder. Mixing humor, and also dark and thrilling moments to the history. Thanks to a superb direction of Polanski, and also the strongest point of the film (and surprisingly the only Oscar that the film received), the script.The script by Robert Towne, who was initially written by Polanski, is superb in every possible detail. Very well written from start to finish, giving the film a wonderful narrative that flows perfectly without ever getting boring and also, thanks to the influence of Polanski, is full of humor. But it also never ceases to be serious and dark when needs to be, giving superb dialogs to the film, adding a lot to the history. Not only long conversations about the case, but also on the definition of what is justice, spread all over the film. Jake before he was a private detective, he was a police officer in Chinatown, and saw many terrible things. And he says in a moment in the film that justice doesn't exist, only we can make-it.Not only the script and direction that construct the film excellently, but also the magnificent actors. Jack Nicholson at the beginning of his career is definitely superb, from start to finish with his huge smile and his angry face, opening a huge future in front of him; Faye Dunaway simply wonderful, she is the mixture of all the heroines of a Noir film, and mature fragile; even Polanski with a small and dark appearance.Polanski, at its best, making an incredible tribute to the Noir genre (perhaps the best Noir movie ever made) with a superb script, beautiful direction, excellent performances, a story that leaves you intrigued and drag you to the end with laughs and chills, and after the end even tears.10/10",10,2,4,28 September 2013
Se7en," David Fincher's first MASTERPIECE.
","Sin: 1-transgression of divine law; 2-any act Regarded to such a transgression, especially the willful or deliberate violation of some religious or moral principle; 3-to commit a sinful act. The Sins began the film and led to the end,but it was no sin making this film.'Se7en', as you can see, it is about the seven deadly sins: Gluttony; Greed; Sloth; Lust; Pride or Vanity; Envy; Wrath. It all starts when the veteran Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and the rookie detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) are both faced with a line of murders, and every death there is a message written with one of the deadly sins. They begin to notice that the killer, who later discover is called John Doe (Kevin Spacey) uses all sins for a different kind of murder. Soon both detectives begin a long study and research behind the insane psychopath who will later lead them to an unexpected end.With 'Se7en' David Fincher showed the fantastic director that he can be. He went from hated (thanks to 'Alien 3') to a true filmmaker giving a spectacular direction. Each scene is shot accurately making the film more tense and the investigation more thrilling. But it also gives credits to Andrew Kevin Walker (screenplay) with a superb writing delivering dialogs very well written and developed, and an insane study in each of the sins, but even with the gloomy environment, the movie manages to have humor that pretty much serves to calm the frantic pace.The cast is just wonderful. Morgan Freeman superb as always; Brad Pitt once again great; but who stands out is Kevin Spacey, after his appearance everything in the film seems to have a relapse, the suspense increases, the atmosphere darkens, all thanks to its whimsical and cultured expression of 'serial killer'.An electrifying thriller, well directed and written, loaded with stunning performances, leading to an unexpected ending. 'Se7en' is the film that brought David Fincher to filmmaking life and to the world his fantastic films.",10,2,4,8 June 2013
The Big Lebowski," Best...black comedy...EVER!
","When the Coens want to be funny and smart. And put violence and stupidity every passing minute. All in that in a movie, the answer is 'The Big Lebowski'. 'The Big Lebowski' not only can be one of the best films of the Coen brothers, but also as one of the funniest movies ever made. The Coens once again manage to put all his humor and intellect in a comedy written and directed as well. Everything in the movie sound Coen material, the story itself is. When the unforgettable 'The Dude Lebowski' (Jeff Bridges) is mistaken for a millionaire with the same surname 'Lebowski', two thugs urinate on his rug to force him to pay a debt he did not even know. Dude seeks and finds the other 'Lebowski' (David Huddleston), not only earned a reward for the ruined rug and also accepts a job at one time as pay-off. Dude then asks the help of his bowling buddy Walter (John Goodman), a gun-toting converted to Judaism with serious anger issues. The little work leads to a huge mess which leads to more trouble, and soon seems that everyone from the porn empire tycoons and improvised criminals want something from The Dude. The whole movie is full of Coen elements. Black humor, moments of absurd violence, but it is never a negative point in the Coen films, but a great talent, especially in its big-black comedy. And as always a fantastic direction from Joel Coen (director) with amazing shots of scenes (one example is a scene where we see the bowling ball inside of it running). And the writing as always very strong in delivering extremely funny and smart dialogs. Leaving the movie extremely entertaining to watch. When the Coen duo want to make a very funny and intelligent movie, with a fantastic direction and writing. And just with a formidable cast with phenomenal performances (especially Bridges and Goodman with very entertaining and superb performances), I must say they are the best on delivery!",9,0,1,3 May 2013
Star Trek," J.J. make-it Star Trek BADASS again!
","Thanks to this film, the world not only came to receive the franchise 'Star Trek' back in style, but also received J.J. Abrams.'Star Trek' is the great return of the famous and most successful franchise back into the 7th great art, all thanks to the nerd J.J. Abrams. When Abrams promised to bring-it back the saga he promised that not only would be loyal to the predecessor's movies and series but also be loyal to all movie fans. With this he meant pure entertainment, and managed to be on the largest possible magnitude.The story of J.J. Abram's Star Trek is half remake and half prequel, working perfectly. Everything starts with the birth of Kirk (Chris Pine) and follows up to his big arrival to captain of the Enterprise and the union with the unforgettable crew, but here enters the mix between prequel and remake. But instead of following the line of actual events of the normal series, everything changes when the cruel Nero (Eric Bana) appears and destroys the ship with Kirk's father inside (which never happened in the original series because Kirk grew up with his father).Many fans may start to take this wrong, but everything changes when Kirk, after series of events, meets the 'future Spock' (Leonard Nimoy), which the 'present Spock' is played by Zachary Quinto, Spock is a Vulcan (beings of high intelligence and pointed ears), both Kirk and Spock don't really get along fine. But the future Spock treats him as a friend, and reveals terrifying secrets of the future related to Nero, which will bring serious dangers to the whole galaxy.J.J. alongside with the screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman managed while being original and at the same time loyal to the original saga with an genius way. The direction of J.J. delivers stunning visuals and gets us through each scene and within the Enterprise (totally magnificent). Not only is super loyal to the saga but also manages to deliver pure entertainment filling the film with great action sequences. But for the movie work and be memorable enough it needed to have a great cast that could manage to incorporate their characters in the greatest perfection, something that didn't miss at all on this film.Each one in the cast does a terrific job in his characters; Chris Pine delivers and makes his Kirk so memorable and Zachary with his unforgettable Spock. Both characters are very well explored and their friendly relationship between the two as well. Not only them but Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Karl Urban (Bones), Simon Pegg (Scotty), John Cho (Sulu), Anton Yelchin (Chekov), all excellent as Eric Bana, despite his villain not be very memorable and explored .Probably the best prequel ever made, super loyal to the original saga, a stunning direction and a superb cast with a amazing chemistry. While delivering pure entertainment and can bring new fans to the saga, and definitely be the best of J.J. (at least until 'Into Darkness') and his grand entrance to the cinema with one of the best 'Star Treks' and one of the best movies with sci-fis action adventure ever made. 9/10",9,0,0,11 June 2013

Citizen Kane," The BEST movie ever made??? Well, I'm not sure, but at least is one of them!
","Many critics today consider this the best movie ever made in the history of cinema. This statement has led many people today think the film is very overrated. Which statement is the right one it is impossible to say, but I think I can understand both opinions.'Citizen Kane' begins after the death of the journalism magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), who moments before dying uttered the word 'Rosebud'. Days after of journalism hype over the news of his death, the journalist Jerry Thompson (William Alland) is sent by his boss to investigate the life of Kane, in order to discover the meaning of his last word, in which no one knows. Then he begins to interview all living people who knew and met Kane. Going from his best friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten); his secretary Bernstein (Everett Sloane); the 2nd ex-wife Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore). The journalist begins to discover that he plunged into the life of a lonely man who from childhood is obliged to follow the will of others. Nobody around Kane cared about him, and then he began looking through the acquisition of things the worship from the people, but it all led to his tragic and painful end.Many said at the time that Orson Welles (who also directed and wrote the film) based the life of Kane on a real tycoon from journalism William Randolph Hearst. Welles at the time denied such claims publicly, especially after Hearst negatively criticized the film saying it would denigrate his image. But the comparisons are almost obvious: Hearst was known to have transformed the simple New York Morning Journal to a sensationalistic newspaper (buy news from other newspapers or invent them) the same thing Kane did with the newspaper 'Inmaker'; Hearst built a castle with his name, the Hearst castle in Florida, and Kane made 'Xanadu' in the Gulf of Mexico, both Hearst and Kane had nationalists and communists concepts (they were part of a political party but then denounced them).The critics doesn't idolize this movie for nothing. Mainly because it is WAY ahead of its time, to imitate the life of a tycoon on a fiction film was almost crime at the time, but not only that. Welles gives the film a magnificent direction with gigantic footage such filming today require multiple cameras (more than 20) and at the time they used a very limited number (less than 5). Including a amazing photography and beautiful cinematographic with spectacular scenery.Not only in direction but Welles gives the film one of the best screenplays ever written, primarily because it can be smart and fun giving a modern language and humorous moments. But above all, gives a timeless narrative to the history, that is, it doesn't follow a single timeline, going back and forward to the past and the future all the time telling pieces of Kane's life from childhood to the arrival to wealth. This technique was very advanced and almost impossible to do at the time. And along the incredible story of Charles Kane, the film uses elements of politics, romance, and even musical. And for several moments, it critiques the rich society and American politics (another thing that at the time was almost a crime).But of course, today many people will find problems in the film compared to today films. It is almost inevitable a film having problems, and 'Kane' is no exception of this. The main problem is with so many characters in the film, somehow it fails in making us care about them (except for Kane), but once again we have to have in consideration the constraints of the script and cast at the time.Speaking of cast, that was also a great revolution. All actors were newcomers, making their first appearances in movies. Not only this fact, but also the fact that they are all extraordinary. Since Joseph Cotten and Dorothy Comingore simply superb, but who stands out is Welles himself. He in their 20s, considered the wonder boy, then took his skills as an theater actor and radio announcer and not only give a excellent directing and writing to the film but also a magnificent performance from start to finish.People have to take in consideration the time that the film was made and not criticize it comparison to today. Early there, it was the beginning of the 2nd world war with much of the economy focused on armaments, Orson Welles with a magnificent direction, superb script and splendid performance managed to make a mark in the history of cinema that should be remembered forever! 10/10",10,4,6,17 October 2013
Memento," Nolan = Genius!
","Memento is one of those movies that will make you be thinking about for days and days. The film is a puzzle very clever and original that will have you guessing from start to finish, and beyond. The story and direction are the best, the way that Christopher Nolan account and directs the film is amazing.Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby, a man who lost his short-term memory in a robbery where his wife was raped and murdered, now he is looking for the killer, despite his mental disability that makes you lose memory after every conversation he has. Simple as that. You do not need to know more.The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put on the skin of Leonard Shelby, wonderfully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives a performance equally mysterious and complex.This movie is well done all the way around - the direction, the editing, and especially that the original story is superb, everything is different from what we have seen. From start to finish the film grabs you physically and mentally, to one of the best endings ever made.",10,1,2,16 April 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino + 2º World-War = Inglourious Bastards
","Like any Tarantino movie, they always are EXCELLENT and unlike anything you've ever seen, and this is no different. Inglourious Bastards is simply amazing. Tarantino grabs in its powerful writing abilities and delivers something Magnifficent. It's the first time that we see Tarantino focusing attention on the WWII, not in battles that marked the war, or in the terrible concentration camps, but in killing Nazis. The Inglourious Bastards are a bunch of American soldiers departing on a top secret mission to end the war. But the film not only focuses attention on this group, but in many unforgettable characters that we see throughout the film, no one is less important than the other, all with their own characteristics. Throughout the film we see many moments of long and intriguing dialogs that hold your attention, and others that are interesting but sometimes they are not that great (that Tarantino already proved be better than that) but this doesn't ruin the movie at all. And also in the movie we have several times when violence explodes on the screen, moments that you was not even expecting, just like a normal Tarantino movie. The entire cast is phenomenal, with unforgettable characters. The film is interesting in that, as I said before, there are several characters of different nationalities. For example, who is German only speaks German, who is French only speaks French, who is English or American only speaks English.Crhistoph Waltz in my opinion was the best of all the characters, he's a cold heart Nazi bastard, but at the same time is so much polite and intelligent, and he's the only character who speaks all languages ​​present in the film. Not only it gives an unforgettable performance, but also Brad Pitt, Mélanie Laurent, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender, and Diane Kruger, and so many others that make's the movie. Full of violence; a lot of fun; intriguing dialogs, Tarantino delivers another original classic to his movie list!",9,0,2,15 April 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Popcorn-flick at its BEST!
","In 1996, the movie 'Independence Day' by Roland Emerich proved that entertainment films, which usually come out in summer (in other words, summer movies, the ones that only serve for a good popcorn) could have a high quality in various aspects from the very story, script and performances. And Gore Verbinski and the writers of 'Shrek' (Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) with 'Pirates' proved that once again in big! 'Pirates' has everything that a summer movie needs to be pure entertainment, from the romantic story of the blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to the beautiful daughter of the governor of Port Royal (Jonathan Pryce), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). That begins to go awry when the weird pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) appears in Port Royal and soon after him the cursed crew of the 'Black Pearl' led by the cruel Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush).Like I said, from romance to comedy and action, everything that a popcorn film needs. But thanks to Verbinski, everything can go much higher and better that we expected. Since the beginning, the film presents a superb script with a good, flowing and entertaining narrative (surprising for a entertainment film), that goes from memorable phrases to intelligent humor, and the plot really takes something pretty serious without exaggerating as other films have tried and failed. But it's not just comedy that elevates the film, is the 'tone-change' that the film has: in scenes between Elizabeth and Will the film seems to have a dramatic tone but never gets to be boring or dry; when Barbossa and his cursed crew appear everything gets dark and kind of scary. But thanks to Jack Sparrow, at all times we have a really good and funny comic relief.The film also contains a superb direction of Verbinski in all scenes, giving the film also pretty adventurous moments when you see the great and vast Caribbean, and also epic moments of action that range from fun choreographed chase-sequences to epic battles between pirate's ships against another. Ah, speaking of pirates, Verbinski seems to have grabbed almost all the clichés of pirates and thrown in the movie: one speaker parrot on a pirate's shoulder (no, neither Sparrow or Barbossa, one seems to have something against animals and Barbossa has a annoying monkey); dirty teeth and horrible breath; the favorite drink of any pirate, rum; and the British navy with elegant gentlemen leading them against pirates, and much more! Now the performances, even Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom have a good romantic connection in their characters, their acting doesn't shine much in this movie (they shine much more in the unnecessary but great sequels that the movie had). Perhaps the reason for this is the superb Geoffrey Rush, that perfectly embodying the spirit of a Pirate since the evilness to the 'aarrgghhh', OR the highest and memorable point of the film that is the EXCELLENT performance by Johnny Depp as the unforgettable Jack Sparrow. His performance was so weird, so fun and so good that it cost him his varied roles in films like the weird and funny guy.'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' can be one of the several examples that entertainment can simultaneously be VERY fun; well written; well-acted; well directed and contain a luxurious soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, 'Pirates' is entertainment and popcorn-flick at its best and much more! 10/10",10,0,1,29 August 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," 'Into Darkness' is the Dark Knight of Star Trek and Abrams the young American Nolan!
","After the great success of critics and winning the love of thousands of fans that was the 'Star Trek' from J.J. Abrams, a sequel was promised. Usually when a sequel to a blockbuster don't usually work well, being simply being horrible or don't even reach the foots, as the first one. But J.J. Abrams hits his hand on the table and imposes its place in management and his great talent as a director and doing a FANTASTIC work.'Into Darkness' is another proof that a sequel can be gigantic while overcoming the predecessor in many details. Without belittling the first one that is fantastic but 'Into Darkness' is also very different from the first but keeps the same pace of entertainment and loyalty to the original saga.The story begins a year after the events of the first movie with Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) along-side with the crew of the Enterprise (with all the cast from the first film) continue on their missions throughout the galaxy to do justice find uninhabited planets. After a 'successful' mission all are called back home where they are faced with an enormous terror taking place on all the cities of their world due to several terrorist attacks within the organization. Now Kirk and the Enterprise crew embark on a manhunt after the unknown terrorist (Benedict Cumberbatch) who seems to be a renegade from the organization. A mission that will take them to a desolate planet where war reigns, behind one man's weapon of mass destruction, a mission where Kirk and Spock will meet all their worst fears and danger plaguing closely to them and their only family, the crew.The story follows a different rhythm from the first film that was part remake and part prequel, 'Into Darkness' it also is but also carries the job of a sequel, but nothing is lost. While the film keeps very loyal to the first one, it also remains faithful to the original saga and thanks to the screenplay really well written and structured by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof that manages to carry with it many influences from the old movies (scenes and even dialogs) mixing everything with a simply brilliant originality.Not only overcomes the first one on writing, but also the direction of Abrams also improves in many details. Keeping the same of pace entertainment and giving superb action sequences also bringing the franchise to a whole new level. Everything in the film looks bigger, since the gigantic scenarios shot in the greatest perfection and reality giving a rate of galactic adventure and action.The cast also excels all greatly improved in their performances and their characters explored more. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto continues to deliver a incredible chemistry in their characters further deepening the friendship of Kirk and Spock with superb performances. But the performance that surprised everyone and even more his character was Benedict Cumberbatch and his villain.... (I can't mention the name without spoilers) with a fantastic performance, superbly embodying his character showing cruelty and intelligence, someone not to be overestimated. And once again overcoming the first one that didn't have a strong villain as as Cumberbatch.In my opinion 'Into Darkness' overcame the 1st fantastically, all thanks to stunning visual effects; superb writing and direction; a good pace of time with snapping breathtaking action sequences along-side with fantastic performances. 'Into Darkness' not only can be one of the best works of the 'Star Trek's saga' but also be one of the best sequels and sci-fis ever made.",9,4,7,16 June 2013
12 Angry Men," Who would knew that 12 'Angry' men in a room on a long dialog would become an ULTIMATE CLASSIC? Really who?!
","12 Men with totally different personalities, located in a room with a bathroom, proved only through words and insults that justice is not an exact science. And also managed to become a timeless classic in the history of cinema thanks to a 20 years old director, Sidney Lumet cheers! The story of '12 Angry Men' is not one that can be reinvent or repeated (despite the fact that it had a good and underrated Reboot in 1997), because the young Lumet and screenwriter Reginald Rose made it a unique experience (and experience several times if you buy on Blu-Ray or download through the internet, easy enough). Everything begins on a normal day like any other in a court where the camera follows the corridors, and shows people and lawyers walking from one side to the other, people getting out fresh from the courtroom, some relieved some doesn't. Once we are in one room with the judge finishing the meeting and sending the 12 juries to the other room to decide the final sentence of a 18 year old boy that, as the evidence presented, 'prove' that he killed his father in a rage attack. The Jurors come into the other room, normal mans who had never met and are there to lend their public service. All normal as if nothing was happening, certain that all the evidence is concrete and the boy is guilty, and a cold-blooded killer. But juror nº 8 (Henry Fonda) disagrees, he does not believe in the innocence of the boy, but also do not believe in his guilt. Now one man must face 11 that fully believe in the guilt of the boy and are tired to go home.Nowadays, the film for this new generation would be boring or perhaps 'impossible to happen'. Perhaps the film has to be viewed with a free and spirit mind to see the tremendous and beautiful message of justice that Lumet's classic tries to transmit. The film, NEVER for one minute gets to be boring or incomprehensible, the direction is superb and all that, but it's the script and the performances that stand out strongly in the film. A story that goes inside one room (and bathroom) had to have one writing at the level of 'non- boring ', no problems with Reginald Rose's screenplay with an amazing flowing narrative, I dare say that perhaps this is the best screenplay ever written (up there with 'The Godfather' and 'Pulp Fiction').From the beginning the audience grasps the plot heavily, not only by the superb script, but the wonderful performances. In the cast we have all the kings of acting from the golden age of cinema, from the heroic Henry Fonda to the ferocious Lee J. Cobb (juror nº 3), to the calm John Fiedler (juror nº 2) and the satirical Jack Warden (juror No. 7). I say the names of the actors because none of them mentions the name throughout the film, really putting the audience in that room with those men discussing the case.I say that the film proves that justice is not an exact science, because thanks to the character of Henry Fonda, the film is full of arguments and assumptions against all evidences presented at the beginning of the case, the case is not shown but through dialogs from the 12 characters. Arguments that are not only to the 12 to think and reflect, but to the movie's audience. Such arguments come in the form of structured dialogs; several of them focus on various topics since politics to social problems and even ophthalmology. The film is not boring annoying also because of the various funny moments with a good intelligent humor, but where there is room for humor there is too no place for pure tension between the characters, tension coming only by words .A classic that will forever be etched and remembered in cinema, thanks to a flawless script and a marvelous cast, a film full of tension and humor and a message of justice that fits perfectly in our today's society, and an emotive finale, '12 Angry Men' is a must see film at least once in your lives. and many more for pure pleasure!",10,0,1,28 August 2013
127 Hours," Danny Boyle's 'Cast Away'.
","One question: what happens when director Danny Boyle, who made the classic zombie movie '28 days later' and the gripping drama 'Slumdog Millionaire', decides to make a biopic of the climber Aron Ralston based on a book that himself wrote? Perhaps one of the best cinematic experiences that someone will have in a movie.For those who don't know the story on which the film was based on, here is a small synopsis here: Aron Ralston (James Franco) is a simple professional mountaineer who plans to one day do canyoning in the Grand Canyon National Park (canyoning » Canyon, get it?) in Utah. When he is climbing through a narrow passage in the middle of the mountain, Aron slips on a loose rock and falls in the middle of the hole with the same rock trapping his right arm. Aron tries to push the stone but fails, cries for help and also fails. Now Aron will have to try to survive and escape that hole before his food and water finish, and he ends up having to amputate his own arm with a blunt penknife.Hell, we can almost say that this film is Danny Boyle's 'Cast Away', only that is located in the Grand Canyon and it doesn't has no coconut called Wilson, only James Franco in a hole, with only two or three other secondary characters. Many may think that this can be boring or tedious, but as I said before, Boyle gives us an unforgettable experience.'But how the hell 94 minutes of James Franco in a hole can be interesting?'. Well, I don't know, maybe the good script of Boyle and Simon Beaufoy maintaining a great line of realism in the story with well-written and even reflective monologues with the character of Aron talking to himself recording everything by its own camera. But what Boyle really makes is literally put ourselves in Aron's place. Not only doing he a relatable character, thanks to an outstanding performance from Franco, but showing what any human being would do in that situation, since scream, cry, think and then later, hallucinate.The parts of hallucination were (and are) a target of criticism from the public, saying that it is where the film fails exaggerating the story, but it is exactly the opposite. When Boyle focuses attention on those moments of hallucination is exactly when he puts us in Aron's place. I mean, how many times we humble humans are with nothing to do, we imagine situations with ourselves and fill our minds with thoughts and memories. Giving himself a chance to show another magnificent direction, both in the flashbacks and memories, but also making us feel the claustrophobia and asphyxiation of the hole with a beautiful cinematography.In short, '127 Hours' is an experience with mandatory viewing at least once in your lives, and believe me, it will be worth it. From a magnificent direction, good script, and (finally) a performance worthy of an Oscar from James Franco makes '127 Hours' not only one of the best films of Boyle, but also an unforgettable experience.9/10",9,1,1,21 November 2013
The Terminator," 'I'll be back' began here and will live forever!
","James Cameron (writer - director) at the time was known only by the awful trash movie 'Piranha II'. Hollywood not even knew his name (today when confirms a movie it already causes controversy, like start doing years later Tarantino) and when 'Terminator' was announced none company was very interested in producing it. And when it came out it was not only a box office success but also became critically acclaimed and till today still considered an ultimate classic film.'The Terminator' was revolutionary for the time it came out, not only because it was made with a low budget and was extremely successful, but many at the time (and even today) consider the film only as a good action movie, but Cameron gave very more than that, the story of the film is something that had never been seen before.Everything begins with two successive murders that occurred in Los Angeles, both murders cause controversy and polemic because both victims had the same name, 'Sarah Connor'. The news reaches the ears of a third Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a beautiful and friendly waitress who begins to feel persecuted. After contacting the police from a nightclub, the Lieutenant Ed Traxler (Paul Winfield) asks Sarah to wait for a police car to go pick her up. While waiting, Sarah is surprised by a huge man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who point a gun at her, but is surprised by a shot from Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who save Sarah's life (at least for a while). Sarah now finds herself in a frenetic chase for her life, but her mysterious savior has more secrets about Sarah that she can imagine and about the mysterious killer who proves to be a real killing machine called 'Terminator 101'.Nowadays this story (or derivatives of it) is used and reused becoming boring and cliché, but it was Cameron who started it all. The film is shown from the beginning as 'a day like any other', by which I mean that Cameron delivers to the film a realistic narrative to their characters since swears; stupid teens just enjoying life; everyday language with playful insults; and also pop-cultural references since the shooting at the nightclub and to Sarah's friend, Ginger Ventura (Bess Motta) that never stop listen to music. Yeah, the film feels very realistic, but not only this that was revolutionary in Cameron film, but also delivers and evolves elements of sci – fi: time travel that had only been seen in 'Back to the Future ' with a good mood and fun style, here it is with a somber and violent tone; an apocalyptic world that was only seen in 'Planet of the apes', also through humorous and philosophical tone, here with a scary tone.The film proceeds with a great narrative, but in management and technical aspects the film was shown really ahead of its time. Since the direction of the Cameron with terrific action scenes, also giving a frenetic and thrilling pace when the movie's chase becomes more violent and frightening. And also has an excellent visual direction from Cameron in flashbacks (or flash-ahead because we are talking about the future) in the apocalyptic future with machines reigning over us, all done with a model that served as help to Cameron later in 'Titanic'.A classic that will live forever in the history of cinema, thanks to a revolutionary and unique history, a fantastic direction, exceptional performance by Schwarzenegger putting him on the map, 'The Terminator' revolutionized the action genre and sci-fi mixing both in this unforgettable masterpiece (yeah, James Cameron's masterpiece)! 10/10",10,1,2,7 September 2013
Hotel Rwanda," Who needs to watch a documentary with such a film around?
","Not expecting much, and I got a lot. The first time I saw this movie, it was during a geography lesson, and just loved it from that moment. The way Terry George portrays the true massacre is impressive, while tense. Rwanda is very well created and the story too, throughout the film raises several philosophical questions that leave you thinking for a long time. The massacre of Hutus against Tutsis recreated this very well and very real. Don Cheadle is superb, simply embodies his character and delivers this true hero was Paul Rusesabagina; Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic, her character is the most credible and he is unrecognizable. The movie made ​​me hate myself, and so many people that the film portrays, that actually exist till this days. Tensing and exciting moments, the film is very real and so inspiring, with an ending that I could not ask for better.",8,0,0,15 April 2013
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Is this a comedy or a political drama??? It can't be both can it? Oh wait, its Kubrick, yeah it can be!
","Does anyone ever stopped to think about the consequences if the nuclear war between the USA and the Soviet Union during the cold war had happened? How it would start and what would be the consequences? Many theories and ideas have been raised over the years, all almost similar always pointing to a possible nuclear apocalypse. Then the director Stanley Kubrick decided to take these theories and joined them with his own ideas and made the masterpiece 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'.'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is a satire that tells the consequences (in Kubrick's mind) of the nuclear war between the USA and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It all starts when the ultra-patriotic and ultra-paranoid General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) seems to have a crazy and patriotic attack, and gives the order to all B-52 bombers that surround Russia initiate the nuclear attack. Such an order reaches the ears of the also very patriotic General 'Buck' Turgidson (George C. Scott) to rapidly informs the President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers). Now the general, the president and his aides, the Russian Ambassador Alexi of Sadesky and the former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (also Peter Sellers) have to find a plan to prevent the attack from the bombers starting the nuclear war.Can you imagine the controversy that this film caused at the time it came out? The world after the Vietnam War and America still redeeming itself. But not only the subject, but the way that Kubrick presents it. What could be a political drama with the theories and ideas of the consequences of war can be presented with great dialogs (which are actually 80% of the film), Kubrick made it a comedy. From start to finish Kubrick delivers a intelligent humor and silly at times without losing the mood, always presenting the 'possible' consequences in a hilarious and satirical way, thanks to yet another flawless Kubrick script.The use of the ultra-patriotism from the General Jack Ripper (if you pay attention his name is a tribute to Jack the Ripper) and the General 'Buck' Turgidson is exactly the statement of the 'ultra - desperation' that the Americans had during the war. General Ripper has a huge patriotism and love for his country that led him to give the order to the nuclear attack, only for precaution. And General Buck is a clear representation of the lazy and ignorant patriotic American people.And where Dr. Strangelove gets into all that? Not only as comic relief (in all his scenes), but also explain the title: 'How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'. In all his scenes, the former Nazi with one hand with own will, tends to try to convince everyone in the war room to accept the situation that they are, accept the nuclear apocalypse. It all comes in all its hilarious scenes where he presents arguments behind arguments silly and clever at the same time, showing the benefits of the nuclear war, all to do with a new era for human kind.Not only the humor and genius of Kubrick that are superbly presented that give strength to the film, but also the fantastic performances of the cast. Both Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott shine with their ultra-patriotism; also Peter Bull as the weird Russian ambassador and Slim Pickens as Major King Kong (pilot from one of the B52s that will launch the bombs). But who steals the show with AMAZING performances is Peter Sellers in all his three roles. As much as the president of the united states, or the crazy and smart ex-Nazi and the friendly gentleman Captain Lionel Mandrake (that tries to convince the general Ripper to stop the attack), Sellers shines (I think he was the only actor who gave ideas and improvisations in the film and Kubrick liked them and changed things on the script because of it).Many critics consider this the best film of Stanley Kubrick, and not for anything. Kubrick joined with his genius, years of ideas and theories of war in a hilarious and intelligent comedy, making not only a governmental critic but also entertains us from start to finish. Thanks to flawless script and direction together with splendid performances. Maybe not the best film of Kubrick ('2001' already has this place), but surely one of them! 10/10",10,1,4,16 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Yeah, 'Empire' was a movie that was really really hard to overcome. But DAMM, what a finale!
","The trilogy that marked and changed cinema forever, that gave George Lucas an huge success, and in this last chapter Lucas once again ask the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the script and delivery the direction to Richard Marquand. All together concludes with a golden key to the magnificent trilogy.....but unfortunately the movie nearly surpasses its magnificent predecessor.'Return' begins months after the events of the previous film with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) imprisoned in the palace of his great rival Jabba the Hutt. Luke (Mark Hamill) begins a rescue plan sending the droids R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C - 3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) as bait while Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Lando (Billy Dee Williams) come infiltrated, Lando as soldier and Leia as bounty hunter. Soon after the great rescue, the group joins with the rebels and begins to know that the Empire is rebuilding the battleship 'Death Star' under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) and begin to dominate the galaxy. The rebels now begin a massive plan to destroy the 'Death Star' and finally put an end to the war. But Luke, with the instruction of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), knows that Vader is not the monster that appears to be and begins to try to bring him to the good side of the 'force'. Such a task will be difficult with the cruel Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) controlling the mind of Vader with the dark side of the force strong in his side.The film never gets to be awful or terrible, as I said before, Lucas and his coworkers end the trilogy perfectly but the film suffers from a serious problem. Since the beginning of the film to the last moment with Yoda (unfortunately) the film flowed superbly, well written and directed by keeping the humor and well action packed. BUT, suddenly the plot jumped to the Rebel base nor explains how Han is feeling after his rescue and now we see very quickly the plan of attack against the Empire. And soon after, we see our beloved crew in the immense forest of Endor entering into a tense action sequence, the action is not a bad thing at all but the rush that the script took over there has a huge problem of narrative that in the end really hurt the film, but everything is reward with a thrilling and exciting final act.Even with a certain problem in the script at the 2nd act, 'Return of the Jedi' is a worthy conclusion to one of the best trilogies ever made, thanks to Lucas that since the beginning redefined the genre of sci - fi forever giving her unforgettable characters with an incredible evolution; thanks to stunning visuals effects giving stunning and unforgettable scenarios;, thanks to John Williams with his unforgettable and powerful soundtrack. The trilogy that not only gave us absolute entertainment and genuinely tense moments, but also taught us that we can always reach our dreams just fighting, we all despite the problems and sins can redeem us and that if we all get together despite our different races can destroy all the forces of evil. 'Return of the Jedi' doesn't surpasses its predecessors, but is a thrilling and epic conclusion to the trilogy that changed cinema forever.9/10",9,0,0,24 September 2013
Taxi Driver," That is not Robert De Niro! THAT IS NOT ROBERT DE NIRO, it is Travis Bickle, one of the best characters ever created!
","Who said that lonely people could never be totally badasses and be true heroes?? Well, with that, I meant exactly what this masterpiece by Martin Scorsese tried and managed to show to the world, and again on the main stage of most of his films, the city of New York.In the movie we have the story of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a veteran of the Vietnam War who lives in his small apartment in the big apple. Travis has severe sleep problems suffering of insomnia, staying up all night, then he decides to work as a taxi driver. Managing to work day and night and earn a good salary. During his travels he meets and falls in love for the beautiful Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) who works in the presidential campaign of the Senator Charles Palantine (Leonard Harris). Travis becomes obsessed with Betsy, following her to work, to her home and finally one day he finally call her out, but loses the chance of having a relationship when he takes her to watch a porno movie. With the loving disappointment Travis goes crazy and starts trying to take justice into their own hands. He gets this chance when he meets the young prostitute, Iris (Jodie Foster).Through this simple story and the character Travis, Scorsese and the writer Paul Schrader were able to explore and send a message and critique against the society. What at the beginning seems to be a study of the human condition with the character Travis (which partly is), it is actually a great criticism that Scorsese make against society showing its dirt and evil.Travis is all part of this critic, a veteran returned form war and working as a taxi driver he gets to know various types of people, moreover working at night. Travis begins to have its own philosophy what is good and evil in the city. The night he seems to see the devil walking through the streets in the bodies of prostitutes and drug dealers, and he sees himself as the renegade hero trying to do justice in some way, trying to send a message, which after several failed attempts. At that point he meets Iris, he finally sees his chance, a poor girl in the middle of all evil suffering at the hands of clients and dirty cowards, Travis then begins to act.Not only the story is very well written and explored in a brilliant way, while Scorsese through his direction in a large scale gives a realistic and dirty picture of New York society, showing the dirt and lack of respect and kindness (even his appearance in the film as a customer of Travis help it). But to make everything more pretty he also shows several places of the city, all of them connected to the story.At the level of writing and directing the film is simply fantastic, and the performances are not different. All excellent, Jodie Foster superb as always, as much as she was in 'Silence of the Lambs' and most of all her work; Robert De Niro..... PERFECT, embodies his character in an impressive way, while we watch the movie we always forget that is not Travis who is driving the Taxi and talking to himself to the mirror (with that I mean we forgot that is a movie at all).A true masterpiece, explores the society in a realistic and obscure way. Thanks to a fantastic writing and direction that created an unforgettable character with superb performances and an ending that makes us open a big smile on our face, 'Taxi Driver' has invisible flaws being a true classic of cinema, one more that Scorsese gave us, an unforgettable film and a dark and fun experience.",10,2,3,17 June 2013
Life of Pi," Ang Lee's first time on 3D??? WOW!
","I don't even know what to say about 'Life of Pi', the film is wonderful, that's all I can say. Ang lee outdone itself with this film, and of course David Magee (screenplay). Both managed to carry the book more indecipherable already done by Yann Martel, and turned it into something simple ... a 16 years in a boat with a wild tiger in the middle of the pacific ocean, simple as that.The story is really about the 'Life of Pi', Piscine Patel is a very smart guy, bullying sufferer, who during his life had learned many religions and took all as his own. When his parents start to have a financial crisis on its Zoo, they decided to move to Canada and sell their animals and start a new life. Everything is going 'well' yet the freighter where Pi and his family were traveling was shipwrecked. Pi is the only survivor, plus a tiger that belongs to his family, and from there both must learn to survive together.The movie is very well done from beginning to end, the history raises several questions, but no waiting for an answer, they are all to carry on our lives. The way Ang and David can put this story as 'simple' as a pretty intelligent way from beginning to end, and how they can make the story as real, the characters are all the scenarios as real, and also their actions and instincts.The visual effects are superb, the animals are super real, even seem real, the sets are magnificent, and fantastic soundtrack fits everywhere, the direction of the film not to mention, as I said Ang Lee outdone itself.Not only him, but as the entire cast, but I must say that Suraj Sharma is FANTASTIC for a first role in movie is nothing bad, but PERFECT! Very well built, very well directed, well acted, messages who persecute you, unforgettable scenery, a story truly exciting and fun for the entire audience, 'Life of Pi' is one of the best films of his year and of all time!",10,1,3,16 April 2013
Barry Lyndon," Stanley Kubrick's Citizen Kane!
","After 'A Clockwork Orange' another of his masterpieces, Stanley Kubrick had already demonstrated his vision of the 1st World War; showed the consequences of the nuclear war between the USA against Russia; the evolution of man through a giant chocolate bar from space; he decided to demonstrate in every detail the rich dynasty from the XVIII century ....... creative wasn't he? Barry Lyndon tells the story of Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) a simple farmer who lives in a small village in Ireland, which begins to live a great passion for his sadistic and persuasive cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton) who makes Barry her loving slave. But when Nora gets a marriage proposal from the English captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), Barry challenges the captain to a duel with pistols that he end's up wining, but badly affects his family because the captain was rich and that marriage would save his family from suffered debts. Barry decides to run away to Dublin, but after being robbed on the road, he lists himself in the British Army to fight in the Seven Years' War, but ends up deserting it after the loss of a friend. Barry then ends up fleeing to Prussia and lists himself in the Prussian army and ends up saving the life of his captain becoming his personal spy. But the Prussian captain sends Barry to spy the Irish gambler Chevalier Balibari (Patrick Magee), but Barry just helps Chevalier fleeing the country and becomes his protégé and best friend. And later seduces and marries the noble Lady Honoria Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) where he finally wins the title of Lord Barry Lyndon that long after only brings him suffering and anguish.Kubrick as always delivers a flawless script followed with a beautiful narrative also giving the film the language of the time with the highest English accent put to film, but every moment of the film Kubrick changes the tone of the story. The film is divided in three acts: The 1st act with Barry going poverty in Ireland and finally reaching wealth in England, the film follows a rhythm sometimes romantic when Barry is with her cousin and when he meets a lover in Prussia, and also with a certain humor at times when Barry flees the British army stealing the horses of two soldiers who appear to be gay and when he helps Chevalier flee from Prussia disguising himself of Chevalier while the real one fled; The 2nd act we see the rise of poverty to wealth of Barry and his great personality change, while in Ireland he was a young man with ideas of freedom and now he is a real greedy man thinking only about his fame and wealth and well-being of his little and sweat heir, becoming a real Oswald Kane; On the 3rd and last act after a sad event we see the decline in the life of Barry starting to lose everything that he built, and as I said before becoming a real Oswald Kane someone who has everything but at the same time has nothing .And once again, in technical aspects Kubrick presents us with a real spectacle of photography and direction. Not only the photography that is beautiful, but in the film Kubrick delivers an amazing wardrobe, as if it had been done in that time, and with stunning views (certainly the most expensive Kubrick film before 'Full Metal Jacket').A film that may not please many or stay in memory, but the demonstration of Kubrick of this era and aesthetic study that he makes of the time through an excellent narrative and a beautiful direction with a luxury cast. Barry Lyndon may be the 'Citizen Kane' of Kubrick with the philosophical study of man with a beautiful story, with technical aspects on top of the ceiling and the photography at the top of Kubrick, 'Barry Lyndon' is another of his masterpieces! 10/10",10,3,6,8 September 2013

The Godfather: Part II," Part 2 of the BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, period! (Here are the reviews of parts 1-2-3 together)
","Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word 'perfection'? Well, 'The Godfather' parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely 'perfect' in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the 'American Dream'; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes 'The Godfather', the strongest brand of cinema till today 10/10",10,1,3,7 October 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ultimatum = Epic
","One of the best franchises ever made, a breathtaking trilogy, and a stunning conclusion! 'The Bourne Ultimatum' can be one of the best trilogies ever made, giving a phenomenal show, ending in a fantastic way the journey of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) after the truth. The story can be very loyal to predecessors and can mix a bit of 'Identity' and 'Supremacy', both at events and also the characters. The film starts in the middle and ends shortly after the end of 'Supremacy', that's where the screenplay by Tony Gilroy and Scott Z. Burns impresses, being written with the greatest possible mastery and deepening the character of Bourne deeper than had ever been. Taking it to a new and dangerous journey to discover the origin of the memories that haunt his past and finally its origins. A journey that will take him to more epics dangers like never before faced. And the direction of Paul Greengrass with elements of action over the story is simply SUPERB! The action sequences of the film can be epic and electrifying at every passing minute, Paul can put them very realistic and puts the audience in the place of Bourne, as if we were there in the midst of all the rush breaking windows, knocking three men at the same time, falling from buildings inside a car and get out alive .... it's just AWESOME as hell!The old cast is still fantastic as ever, as Matt Damon who gives an Excellent performance of Bourne as never before.One of the best endings to a saga, being faithful to the predecessors, deepening the character more, the levels of performance, technical history as the movie is just FANTASTIC from start to finish. 'Ultimatum' manages to be not only the best film of the franchise, as well as one of the best Action-Thrillers ever made!",10,0,0,16 April 2013
Fargo," 'Based on a true story'...Best...joke...ever!
","Soon at the beginning of the film we see the phrase 'based on a true story.' After watching it, I made a large network research about the history and I didn't found anything. Only later I realized that it was just the first joke of the movie..... HA.The story is set in 1987 at Fargo, in North Dakota. When Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) a manager of a car dealership, see himself in a delicate financial situation. Then, he plans the kidnapping of his wife Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) and makes an agreement with two marginal. The unnerved Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and the sinister Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), where both would win a new car and half of the $ 80,000 that would be paid by the father of Jean, Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell), an arrogant and stubborn rich man. But a series of unforeseen events, it creates just the beginning of a triple murder. And the a pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) tries to solve the case, which continues to cause more deaths.The beginning of the film, there is the certainty that the viewer is facing a drama. What it is, only with black humor from beginning to end, with the Coen style. For some that it is the first time watching from the Coens it may seem really weird, but who is already accustomed with, it may be facing a small masterpiece. It was with this film that the world saw the talent of these two brothers who can write a black comedy based on a drama. Very entertaining and intriguing from the very beginning and a agonizing and exhilarating soundtrack. The strongest point of the film is that not only focuses attention on the line of murders but also with all the characters around her. Leaving them quite fun and relatable, each with fantastic performances.Frances McDormand is superb and fully deserved her Oscar; William H. Macy as well with a superb performance. At the beginning I didn't look like much of his performance, but over the film he manages to deliver a performance worthy of a nomination. But the biggest surprise of the film in the level of performance was truly Peter Stormare with its sinister character. Making a marginal and intriguing look, putting the viewer almost close to a lunatic.A real small masterpiece from the Coens. Very entertaining and intriguing from start to finish with really well written characters, all with hell-of a performances. A superb writing and directing in a movie that is simply fantastic, with a final message really chilling and thrilling.",9,0,0,4 May 2013
Watchmen," Best comic book adaptation ever. Period!
","The great masterpiece of comic books by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons 'Watchmen': the great revolution of comics in the 80's giving the world a darker and mature vision of 'Heroes', can truly be Zack Snyder's masterpiece.Zack, with the help of David Hayter and Alex Tse (writers) could bring 'Watchmen' to the big screen in an impressive way. The story of 12 chapters, about a world where superheroes really exist since 1930, all of them taking as inspiration the hero Superman. Each with their own abilities and 'powers'. In this world, the U.S. won the Vietnam War thanks to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) the most powerful of all heroes, powers to controls the atoms (this means he control everything), he is considered by world's population one true God. After that and the third re-election to the presidency of Nixon, the police begins to strike and civil unrest against masked vigilantes. With that Nixon is forced to sign the Keene Act in 1977 which consisted of all 'costumed adventurers' to register with the government. With this most vigilantes decided to retire, some revealing their secret identities mostly to win cash thanks to the media's attention, that was the case of Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode), the 'Ozymandias.' Others, such as 'Comedian' (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and 'Dr. Manhattan', continued to work under the supervision and control of the government. The vigilante known as Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), however, has operated as a renegade hero and out-of-law, frequently pursued by police.Years passed and the cold war ravaging the world, 'The Comedian' (the hero most despised of all) is found dead in his house, having his secret identity being revealed. This draws attention to Rorschach begins contacting his former colleagues for clues, considering almost everyone as possible suspects.All 12 chapters were transported in an impressive way to the cinema, the Adaptation of Snyder is fantastic and can be very loyal to the comic. The entire cast was perfectly chosen for the heroes, all with excellent performances, but who stands out for me is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. He was always my favorite character and the film also manages to show me this, Rorschach is more BADASS than ever was, as the movie it-self, not only Badass (as most of Snyder's movies) but it manages to be the best adaptation from a comic to the screen ever made! P.S: Do not even know why that Alan Moore says he does not like the movie (or even seeing), saying that his work had been ruined, it seems that Dave Gibbons was the only one to congratulate Snyder and his Excellent work.",9,1,3,15 April 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Part 1 of the Longest movie ever made! (This is the review of the entire trilogy)
","The longest movie ever made, so long that the director had to divide it in three parts, and that's why people call a trilogy. 10 hours of a phenomenal spectacle that will leave anyone with tears and a heavy heart after the magnificent end.In 'The Fellowship of the Ring' we start with the journey of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) towards to Mordor, lair of the dark lord Sauron. And we see the great training and union of the Fellowship of the ring, an alliance of all the living beings of Middle-earth on a mission to destroy the 'One Ring' and thus save the world from the darkness.In 'Two Towers' we have the beginning of the Great War between humans and orcs, with the army of Saruman (Christopher Lee) marching against the kingdom of Rohan. And Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) along with the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) joining in the battle. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are getting closer every day to the lair of Sauron, now having the help of the strange creature Gollum / Smeagol (Andy Serkis) who wants by all means his 'precious'.And finally in 'The Return of the King' we have the spectacular ending to the trilogy / film. Since the beginning of the film we felt the feeling that everything is coming to an end. Frodo and Sam finally reached Mordor and try to find a way to infiltrate into the enemy territory and Gollum / Smeagol plans to take the ring from Frodo, who becomes increasingly heavy. And on the other side we have the beginning of the great battle that we expected since the first movie, the showdown between humans and orcs in the battle that will determine the fate of the world with all the characters we have learned to love here together in this fight to the uncertain ending.Peter Jackson (director-writer) brought to life the masterpiece of books, 'Lord of the Rings' by the genius JRR Tolkien. This can be the best adaptation of a book to film ever made, if the book is already a masterpiece in the world of books, Jackson made a masterpiece of cinema. The gigantic story that was told in six books, in film it was told in one film. A film of more than 10 hours, it had to be divided into three parts forming the best trilogy already made. I say it's just a movie because all three movies work as one, from the beginning to the end we realize that.Since the first film (or first part) we have the magic of Tolkien's working here, along with Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens (writers) have recreated and remained faithful to Tolkien's work and the film managed to raise the themes of friendship, courage and while it has always had religious references in the book and the film manages to convey everything in the greatest perfection.Not only the writing is phenomenal, but the visual effects are stunning giving a gigantic scale the movie, so well detailed visual effects that make everything look so realistic. And the effects are not only stunning but also that the soundtrack that is simply magnificent.A trilogy that works as a single film that is a true masterpiece. A landmark in film history thanks to excellent writing and direction of Jackson and fantastic performances from all the cast, 'The Lord of the Rings' is the epic fantasy stunning in every detail and be loved by all.10/10",10,0,0,7 October 2013
Man of Steel," Superman ask me once: 'What this F stand for?' I answered: 'It's not a F, in my world means F#CK THE CRITICS!!!
","The 'Superman' franchise had almost the same fate of the 'Batman' franchise: the first two are considered unforgettable classics and one of the best films of superheroes ever made; the 3rd has a good rhythm of fun but not the maturity of the predecessors; the 4th completely ruins the whole franchise ridiculing him completely. But years later an unknown director decides to resurrect the franchise that was Bryan Singer case with 'Superman Returns' and Christopher Nolan with 'Batman Begins' but then the big difference: 'Begins' had good critics and received the love of many fans, 'Returns' had good critics but fans hated saying it was too boring. Nolan then felt pity of the poor hero, and then he asks for help from the young director Zack Snyder and David S. Goyer once again to revive the Superhero so long forgotten.'Man of Steel' is completely different from the previous Superman movies that seemed to have a connection (even Returns), so that's why the critics didn't appreciate much, but neither was supposed to. Nolan along with Goyer does almost what they did with the 'Dark Knight trilogy', put a good realism and make it almost unique, a new and fresh start to what is considered the greatest superhero of all time. Of course, it was obvious that they were going to grab the usual story of Superman that goes from his birth, to the destruction of his planet and his escape to earth and later become the great American hero, but the philosophical and realistic study that Nolan and Goyer can do to the superhero is amazing.The film is not only the life of Clark / Kal-El (Henry Cavill) from child to the almighty man that saves people, but shows how he comes to be called a superhero. The human touch that the film gives to Clark / Kal-El is superb; we feel that he is really a human being like anyone else who begins to discover that it has powers than his search for its origins leading him to a journey across the world. Not only gives Superman a human and realistic touch but also places the superhero as a symbol (same as both made with the Batman). What for some it can be a symbol of hope that a human can reach the limits of the impossible being a total miracle, or having in mind the fact that Clark / Kal-El is not human, the message that we are not alone in world, both perspectives give the hero a religious symbolism.But even with the film having philosophical touch; it never misses the reality by giving realistic explanations of Clark / Kal-El powers. When he was born in a totally different atmosphere of the earth, it can give a strong use of gravity (explains the power of flight and the super strength) and even the sun's energy (rays laser eye and the vision through things). And also the realistic feel of the consequences of his powers in our world, and that's where Snyder enters magnificently.Snyder is what Superman always needed to have action, giving a grand scale to the film and to the power limits of Clark / Kal-El, especially when General Zod (Michael Shannon) the villain of the film begins its his attack on earth, also beginning a mass destruction and a superb visual combats. And that's where Snyder impresses with the direction, which in the past always used slow motion in his films, in 'Man of Steel' we never have those moments proving to be a director who can adapt to changes.Another point to be pointed out is the formidable cast that carries the film: Amy Adams great as always; Russel Crowe that everyone thought that would had a small role proved to be a strong and great Jor-El; Michael Shannon takes a ferocious and cruel performance as the powerful Zod; Henry Cavill completely convinces to be a superman, since his voice and even his posture.'Man of Steel' even if not better than the first supermen or reach the feet's of the Dark Knight trilogy, managed to be, thanks to Snyder and Nolan, a film of Super-Heroes that many have come to expect: a nice philosophical and optimal human touch with a lush and destructive action scenes (without losing the reality). Having a serious and realistic tone but keeps a good pace of entertainment, and leaves many wishing for a powerful new franchise.",8,9,16,9 July 2013
American Psycho," I gotta return some videotapes, but definitely not this one!
","So many movies that start with the word 'American': 'American Beauty'; 'American History X'; 'American Pie'. All of them with their own message and version of America, and now this underrated classic not only shows a new vision of America but also of his craziest psychopath.... interesting no? 'American Psycho' tells the beautiful, crazy, insane, fun, violent life of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). An eccentric American businessman working as an executive of a major bank in Wall Street. Patrick in work he seems the normal rich American worker, but Patrick has an extraordinary secret life ranging from a daily routine with certain quirks to keep things arranged in a certain order; food fads; crazes appearance at work; kill someone in cold blood every night since prostitutes coworkers that he just felt jealousy; and .... oh, wait a minute! As you see, the life of Patrick is one of a psychopathic killer who tries to hide appearances at work, but the film goes far beyond the expected. Director- writer Mary Harron to adapt the novel of Bret Easton Ellis at the same time she tries to be faithful, it goes much further exploring the mind of Patrick 's character more and more.The film with a story that it could had follow with a somber and a creepy tone of horror movie, but no. In the first few scenes of the film, Mary Harron presents us with a beautiful humor, that ranges from clever phrases to a humorous narrative, and 70% of comes from the mouth of Patrick makes us laugh, that make us feeling at certain times that we are facing a black comedy. Some may consider the humor stupid or unnecessary, but it serves mainly to make us relate to the character Patrick throughout the film, even in the darkest hours.And yes, the film doesn't escape to have dark and even scary moments, but those moments come through a superb narrative followed with great dialogs with many varied subjects ranging from women-philosophy to the characteristics of the perfect business cards. We even have a moment of dialog between Patrick with two lovers about the songs of Whitney Houston that end's up in the most violent and grim scene of the movie, making us feeling that we are now facing a violent and disturbing film. Such dialogs may be unnecessary for some or boring, but they are so well written and interesting, and serve once again to get into the mad mind of Patrick that at various points where we got to see the kind of person he is and the cause of his great hatred for human being and even the cause of his daily foibles, everything related.In the levels of performance, the entire cast does a good job, but as always Bale delivers an extravagant performance with its unforgettable character and superb acting deserved of at least a nomination.A film that goes from humorous to dark and sometimes mysterious, complete with a great script and good direction with an extravagant performance of Bale, makes us enter in the mind of a psychopath in this unforgettable and must-see classic.9/10",9,1,2,14 September 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," Funny and smart Script and astonishing performances makes you laugh like a lunatic, and cry like a little miss sunshine after losing a contest! (oh, wait)
","Have you ever heard of those 'Little Miss Sunshine' contests? The ones that glosses, fantasize and pamper girls between 6-9 years old and put them to compete to see which one is the most beautiful (in other words beauty contest for spoiled children)?! And it always ends up with the winner flattering herself and the losers crying?! Well don't worry, this film is not about that, at least not 80% of it. And actually makes you crack-yourself laughing, and teaches you a lot about family relationship.'Little Miss Sunshine' begins with the Hoover family. A really problematic family, with: the father Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear), an advertising manager that tries to sell his campaign about the 9 steps to achieve success, but the poor guy just don't want to admit that he is a poor loser; the mother Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) trying to put peace in the house but it always fails miserably. Even more when she brings her problematic-homosexual brother Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) from the hospital after trying to kill himself by depression (his boyfriend cheated on him with a teacher that end up being super rich and famous); the older son Dwayne (Paul Dano), a teenager who hates everyone and made a vow of silence to his parents let him be an airplane pilot; the grandpa Edwin Hoover (Alan Arkin) who was expelled from his retirement house and now he swears and smokes weed every day, every hour. The family day-to-day changes when Olive (Abigail Breslin) the youngest daughter (and probably the most normal member of the family) gets a call saying that she was approved and can participate in the 'Little Miss Sunshine' contest in Redondo Beach, which had always been her dream. The family 'couldn't resist' her cuteness and decided to travel to Redondo Beach in their old Volkswagen Type 2 to take Olive to the pageant. But crazy drawbacks will appear on the road.For the synopsis you can imagine that it is a road trip movie and in the end she wins the contest and the whole family ends up happy. But thanks to Michael Arndt screenplay things go through the crooked and not only makes the family happy but also we. With this I mean that this film, that is considered a family drama, expect many die-laughing moments. Of course the film doesn't lose its dramatic side (which is quite heavy in the film) showing family and life situations with a beautiful narrative. But Michael Arndt with a really smart humor can make all the really sad situations, really really funny.Even the directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris help spice up the humor and drama of the film. It has moments that seem to be Wes Anderson making the film (drama and comedy together with a funny vision of the world sounds his style), but the directors put very well the situation of the film in our world. Especially at a emotional time in the trip, and on the arrival in the contest, but it never loses his sense of humor making us laugh by every minute.But for everything to work out, a really great cast would have to be up the height of the movie, something that doesn't lack in this film. Yes, Alan Arkin took the Oscar in the film, and it wasn't for nothing thanks to his funny swears and his pure human side, but in the cast doesn't lack out great performance. Since: the little Abigail Breslin (superb); the troubled teenager Paul Dano (excellent as always) that it doesn't say one word till half of the film in the most emotional and funny scene; and Steve Carell surprises with a hilarious and superb performance (and proved to be perhaps the most important character in the film).A gripping drama that teaches us a lot about family and life, but thanks to a superb cast and amazing script, makes us laugh after laughs and get fun by every minute that passes. And after the end, this little masterpiece makes us open a huge smile on our face! 9/10",9,0,0,14 October 2013
Hugo," Now I can say that Scorsece has made movies of almost all kinds.
","After 'The Departed'; 'Taxi Driver'; 'GoodFellas'; 'Raging Bull'; 'Gangs of New York'; 'Shutter Island' ... I never thought that Martin Scorsese would make a movie like this, and what kind movie is? Well, read to the end and find out. 'Hugo' tells the story of.... Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan boy who lives in a train station in Paris, his job is to make the station's clock always running. But while unraveling the mystery of the little 'robot' that his father left him before he died. Until he met the mysterious toy seller (Ben Kingsley) that inadvertently shows have known anything about it. So Hugo embarks on a quest to find out this secret, which seems to be difficult with the station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) in pursuit of any 'offenses against the law.' Throughout the movie this mystery increases with each passing minute, but nobody realizes that the John Logan (screenplay) always gives little hints of secret throughout the film. And when it comes, is a true wonder to who's watching because nobody was expecting that, although the tips are always there. With the secret many will say that the movie is really meaningless, and that is very childish. But no one sees how much this is awesome, a director who has always done adult films, and now makes his grand debut in 3D making a movie for the whole family. Managing to keep the entertainment of his films, and a impeccable 3D direction. And the secret might not impress much, but who is a lover of cinema (like me) will love it, because while it is for movie fans, it is also a tribute to the King of cinema Georges Méliès.Even the cast impressed me, Ben Kingsley perfect as always and Asa Butterfield also excellent. But I was impressed with Chloë Grace and Sacha Baron Cohen, Chloe who was the Hit-Girl in 'Kick Ass,' and Sacha who was Borat in 'Borat', Bruno in 'Bruno' and Dictator in 'The Dictator'. Both actors have been in completely different characters from the ones they are playing in here, well, this just proves that they are great actors. I loved 'Hugo' from beginning to end, had a great time and met the King of the 7th art in a fun and realistic way. A true tribute that gave many movie fans a chance to meet their King in such a fun and exciting way.",10,4,7,15 April 2013

","Stephen King, the greatest writer of all time, never bothered much about the adaptations of his works to the big screen. Not even should it, after the great critical and box office success that was 'Carrie' from Brian Palma, King thought that everything was secure in his job. BUT, Stanley Kubrick was already knew for making films that cause scandals and make controversy. King hated the adaptation (so much that he did a series based on the book years later) and the reviews were very mixed, but the audience (I'm part of the audience) LOVED.The story begins when the writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) gets a job offer that involves taking care of a huge hotel during the winter. Jack decides to take his family along for an unforgettable vacation while also working on his next book. Everything seems going well, but a dark ghostly presence changes everything and start's haunting the family chamber by chamber of the immense hotel, causing small attacks on Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) who seems to have strange psychic powers, and Jack start's having disturbing visions that initiates a large development of pure madness.I think Kubrick intention never was to ridicule the work of King, the lack of loyalty was due to the immense work dependence that Kubrick always had. But this just opened place to the extraordinary originality and dark philosophy that Kubrick always given us.As always with Kubrick, the film contains a flawless script and follows with a outstanding narrative from start to finish, and with the horror genre in film is best to wait for dark dialog's with the disturbing soundtrack of John Jacob. And the direction (since '2001') has never been EXCELLENT giving a amazing and truly frightening filmography.Kubrick with this film just created the 'scary-house' horror genre, thanks not only to the history, but thanks to the mixture of the splendid performance from Jack Nicholson and Kubrick's dark philosophy. That throughout the film thanks to the excellent narrative and one dark scene in the bathroom, it creates the scary and crazy environment of the 3rd act, and face a insane and unforgettable phrase Nicholson everything ends in another unforgettable masterpiece that Kubrick always knew how to give us. And the final message is that in all of us there is a crazy and murderer side waiting to be released.All I have to say is: 'Hi Johnny, but you are seriously not welcome in my bathroom'! 10/10",10,0,2,26 August 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," When he say 'I'll b back' he wasn't kidding.
","OK, that's the thing with James Cameron, when he announces something it takes almost a decade to come out (still waiting for Avatar 2 and 3). Same thing with 'The Terminator: Judgment Day', after the great success of 'The Terminator' Cameron received letters and desperate requests to he make a sequel and then he promised he would. 6 years have passed, Cameron had time to do the Excellent 'Aliens' and the underrated 'The Abyss', and finally in 1991 came this film, and every minute of the wait was worth it! 'The Terminator: Judgement Day' is still considered one of the best sequels ever made, not by critics who said that was not even at the level of his predecessor, but by fans who won over the years. Cameron made both classic films totally different, and unforgettable !The story begins 10 years after the events of the 1st movie and we found Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrested in a rehabilitation clinic accused of attacks of madness and visions with killer robots and the end of the world to come thanks to a nuclear war. On the other side of the story we have John Connor (Edward Furlong), the prodigal son of Sarah Connor, the future leader of the human resistance against the machines, a rebellious and troublemaker boy living with adoptive parents (the characteristics of a true leader, nothing like a suffered childhood to build a strong warrior). But as in the first, a killing machine was sent to kill Sarah Connor and prevent the birth of John, in this one a machine is sent to assassinate John, this work is now up to an advanced model of Terminator the T-1000 (Robert Patrick). But just like in the 1st film, the resistance sends someone to protect him in this one, not a beautiful blonde soldier this time but a T-101 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger).In the 1st movie, Cameron picked sci - fi and action elements evolving them, here he takes on its own material and evolves it to a new level. The critics considered that a more expensive copy, but fans considered a MAGNIFICENT recycling taking everything bigger and bolder. While the 1st movie had a dark and violent tone, and the feel of a thriller, on this one Cameron takes everything to a more personal and dramatic side and even to a philosophical tone at a point. All this thanks to Schwarzenegger character suffering (positively) a big change, while in the 1st movie audiences cheered for his destruction and threw insults after insults, putting him on lists of the greatest movie villains. In this he reveals himself as the savior of both Connors, swearing allegiance and obedience to protect both with his life (in fact he was programed to defend them, but in both ways will all lead to the big show), leaving the audience cheering for him and the Connors by every passing minute .From the philosophical point , is the reason that the Terminator it is also programmed to understand the human senses and feelings, not only to understand their weaknesses, but through an excellent narrative that goes with the film giving several scenes between John and the machine and its relationship protector for friendship. And at the same time with this, Cameron starts a vision of human values in various scenes that lead to an amazing final message that make everyone reflect (it was also here that Cameron began to make some critical reflections in all his films).Reflections and relationships at a side, the part when I said that Cameron took everything to a new level, I mean everything. The action of the 1st film, was shootout in police stations and car chases at night. In this one we have two killing machines tearing limbs and throwing each other through walls and FREAKING AWESOME and huge car chases (like I said, recycling at its best). But it was not just the action that had a huge evolution, but also the stunning visual effects that the film contains (and very advanced for its time).In levels of performances, Schwarzenegger after the 1st film he entered on the map, on this one he definitely gets to be the iconic face of the action genre; Linda Hamilton in the first was a fragile waitress seeing her life suffering from a huge changeover, in this one she became the human exterminator, showing that after the death of her love one she had to learn how to survive alone (and very well by the way).Many fall trying to decide which Cameron's Terminator is the best, for me is hard to say which is above the other. Both have completely different tones and many different aspects and both truly unforgettable, and both received the same title of being the best action movie ever made but Cameron showed that it could be much more than that. With superb performances, stunning visuals and breathtaking action, both 'Terminators' are both classics to be remembered forever!10/10",10,1,1,7 September 2013
Apocalypse Now," What can I say about this film?? Brutally INSANE!
","Coppola already showed us his vision of the American Mafia in 'The Godfather' (family and honor above the business), now in 'Apocalypse Now' he show's his vision of the Vietnam War (pure insanity). This leads to the problem of how can I even begin to comment on the film. Comment technical aspects, the performances; the superb script, everything is so PERFECT!Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director, but he is a total genius on writing as he was as a director, I said 'was' in the past, because while making this film his seems to have exhausted all creative brain cells in his head (compared with the films he does today), but the sacrifice was worth it. We have a script that is so insane and disturbing as it is on screen, but the involvement of Coppola on the script injected a narrative that reflects exactly the war.The story is set during the Vietnam War, when Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent on a dangerous mission into Cambodia to assassinate a renegade colonel (Marlon Brando) who defined himself as a God among a local tribe. During this journey we see the spectacle that Coppola planned from the beginning, we see a little of everything War; Adventure; Sex; Partnership, a bit of humor, all coated in a script and scenario that are simply spectacular, and as I said before, INSANE.When Coppola says: 'This film is not about Vietnam - is Vietnam' he's right. What began as a patriotic war to defeat Communist aggression, changed America's view of the world and of himself and world view of America is the beauty of the folly of Apocalypse Now, which makes it a masterpiece of film and says more in its running time on the brutality of the conflict and hypocrisy of politicians. 'Apocalypse Now' is the 'Insane Masterpiece' of cinema!",10,0,1,16 April 2013
Edward Scissorhands," Never thought I would see one day a magic movie so violent
","This movie just proves that Tim Burton can do true classics, and 'Edward Scissorhands' is one. The film is pure entertainment from start to finish, funny and exciting. Edward is a boy that was built by a scientist, but during his construction the scientist suffers a heart attack and Edward is unfinished lacking hands, that in place of them have sharp scissors. Edward is later found by Miss Peg who sees the sweet and sympathetic boy that Edward is and takes him to his home and adopts him. The whole town gets to know Edward's arrival due to gossipy neighbors who Miss Peg and her family have, and everyone is interested to know Edward, who shows have multiple special talents with his 'scissorhands'. The cast this solid and does a good job, but Johnny Depp is superb, makes a character so adorable and sweet that we learn to love from start to finish, and see the magic of his character only by his look. A film that shows a classic character that we relate and remember forever after watching-it, a magical movie that makes us laugh and cry ... Thanks Tim Burtom!",9,0,0,15 April 2013
Aliens," Another sequel were James Cameron kick's ass!
","After Ridley Scott's classic 'Alien', seven years after James Cameron decided to make his sequel, and ended up making of his 3rd movie a very different from 'Alien (much better) and a true classic.The story of the film takes place 57 years after the events of 'Alien', Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was found after years in a state of stasis cryogenic (frozen). Now anyone on earth doesn't believes in her story of the massacre of her crew because the creature Alien and Ripley discovers that the creature's planet, LV-426 had been colonized and now habited. Now Ripley receives a request from the 'Company' to lead a team of space marines to investigate the colony on the planet LV-426 because all communications had been lost. Little does she know that she is about to face her worst nightmare and still more to come. James Cameron has proved with this film to be a phenomenal writer-director. While 'Aliens' is super loyal to his predecessor, Cameron gives a new strength to the franchise, making it different from the predecessor. Mainly because 'Alien' was a sci-fi horror with pure tension. And 'Aliens' is a sci-fi action, but the terror and scenes of pure tension are still there.Sigourney Weaver also evolved along with the film with a performance totally bad-ass. While in 'Alien' it was just the only survivor, here she proves his value and his extreme courage.Much better than 'Alien', James Cameron delivers one of the best sequels ever made with pure entertainment and all elements of the predecessors of making 'Aliens' a true masterpiece.",10,0,1,28 April 2013
American History X," The movie tries to transmit a message, this message is...STOP BEING RACIST!
","If you are expecting a movie with testosterone and gang fights just for pure fun and entertainment, you chose the wrong movie. If you came to see a drama with a powerful story with a deep and powerful message that will leave anyone who watch wet in tears by the end, then you chose the right film.'American History X' is a drama with a story full of violence and a deep message against society. Everything starts with Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) who after the death of his father by a black man, forms a Nazi-Racist gang called 'skinhead' and with it the attempt to exterminate and expel all blacks and immigrants in their neighborhood by invading properties and get in conflict with other gangs. One day his house is assaulted by a member of a rival gang, which ends up in a double murder and with the arrest of Derek. 3 years pass and now Derek totally changed, is trying to clear his family name and try to ward off his brother Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) from the life of crime and racism that himself led into.The film has a very interesting direction by Tony Kaye, filmed in a dramatic and disturbing way. The film is divided into two parts; one in present with Derek coming out of prison and Danny getting closer to the gang; the other part telling Derek's past and how he came from a violent racist to the repentant man haunted by his past. Both parties superbly filmed with shades of different colors. In the present with normal and colorful shot, in the past with black-and-white shots.Not only the direction is superb as well as the writing of David McKenna delivering to the film disturbing and racist dialogs. At first it may seem that the film is in favor of racism and extermination of races. But throughout the film we noticed that they all try to show how stupid and inappropriate is racism and the prejudice that it can bring to those who practice it. All events on file show that more and more, and also the characters that built up the movie, mainly the professor Bob Sweeney (the old professor of Derek and the new from David) and Derek's 'friend' in prison. Both of them through the movie show to Derek that all of us are equals.But the message to be delivered perfectly it needed superb performances to complete everything and leave everything fantastic. Thanks to both Edwards this is not missed: Furlog proves to be a great dramatic actor, and Norton proves to be one of the best actors of his generation with a FANTASTIC performance that improves with every passing minute.A film with a deep story; superbly written and with a final message that can make the toughest of men shed a tear thanks to fantastic performances and flawless direction. 'American History X' is a film to be seen and be remembered by many.",10,1,3,8 June 2013
No Country for Old Men," A human and violent Tom and Jerry!
","'When a rat eats the cheese, he gets fat, with that he becomes a prey to the cat because the cat loves the rat's fatness and starts chasing him insanely, during this chase the old dog sees the situation and starts chasing the cat because it is his great rival, and somehow help the mouse because he has nothing against him, making a kind of justice. That's 'No Country for Old Men ', with humans and a nowadays western, and arguably the best work of Joel and Ethan Coen .... the Coens! The story begins when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a former Vietnam veteran finds a briefcase with $ 2 million at a crime scene. Suddenly finds himself being hunted by the pure evil that is the character Anton Chigurh (Javier Barden) a violent persecution from Texas to the Mexican border. And behind them, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) in search of Anton and somehow protect Llewelyn. Most intriguing in this persecution is that the three characters never interact, just chase between them, which increases every second.The Coen once again surpassed themselves, not only were super loyal Cormac McCarthy's novel, but took your stuff to a new level. 'No Country' has a dark tone and a really scary cat-and-rat persecution through the vast modern western that brings many kills and whiles much suspense. The three characters never interact in the film; one is always one step after another, getting much more electrifying and frightening.But even with the dark tone, the Coens have managed to make the film strangely fun, the little black humor of the Coens (even in small amounts) is present here. Not only is the tiny humor that make's the movie really fun to watch, but is full of intriguing dialogs and very interesting to listen to, the Coens have never been good at writing on his films. But not only is the partnership of the two brothers in the screenplay that stands out but also the direction. The film manages to have action sequences filmed in a greater perfection and style, the two Coens working behind the camera is delightful to watch.The cast also not left behind, both Tommy and Josh are perfect in their roles, but Javier is fantastic in every detail, her character is so mean and cruel and at the same time, very intriguing. He is the wild cat whatever grease, money Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee's old dog who wants to do 'justice'.The Coen brothers were overcome by presenting a film written and performed in a fantastic way, a story full of suspense and a final electrifying message as in every movie of the Coens, while in 'Fargo' it was about the lack of decency and respect for human beings , 'No Country for Old Men' takes us back to the lack of honor that our society suffers today, and how respectful and honorable are our ancestors. A modern Western that manages to be the definitive masterpiece of Coen, totally recommended!",10,3,4,15 April 2013
District 9," Independence day + Signs + Clouse encounters + clichés = 'District 9'
","The Aliens franchises of films in recent years proved too repetitive: or they were an apocalypse with a huge alien invasion on our planet; or the good aliens arrive on earth and are unwelcome. Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson finally managed to bring back the old spirit of the original Aliens movies with 'District 9'.'District 9' unlike other Alien films, scraped together all sorts of Alien clichés, ranging from big cockroaches to super-intelligent beings who can be peaceful and dangerous at the same time, and have a super ultra-pack laser guns ... cool right?! Well, let's start with the story. 'District 9' begins in 1982 when a massive alien ship (on 'Independence day' style) begins to fly over Johannesburg, South Africa (yeah, it's not New York or Washington ... finally!). That ship was carrying an entire population of strange creatures (giant super smart cockroaches) called 'The Prawns'. Humans put and housed the aliens in a huge military area called District 9, where 'the prawns' could live peacefully with humans. But 28 years later, the entire area was damaged into a massive slum with African militias bribing and terrorizing 'the prawns'. In 2010 the multinational weapons enterprise 'MNU' (Multi-National United), that spent years researching the use of the weapons aliens that were also transported on the ship, was hired to transfer all the aliens to another military district called District 10 (UOL , I didn't expect that). To this they put in charge of the operation the employee Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley)... but like any Aliens films things did not turn out very well, especially for Wikus that after being infected by a strange alien virus, begins a furious fight for his life.As said before Neill Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell (Peter Jackson worked as a producer this time) put together in a beautiful script all kinds of Aliens clichés in a masterly and original fashion (mainly because the entire movie take's place in Johannesburg and not in a American capital). But while with the clichés, they showed a great originality in two aspects: the first is the fact that almost the entire film is presented as a documentary (this thing has never been done in aliens movies); and also the fact that they present a huge society critic soon after the incident with Wikus.Wikus who was a huge prejudice towards the 'Prawns' begins to depend on them when he gets infected and starts to turn into one of them. Everything he had from friends and family begin to treat him like an animal. We begin to feel their pain and rejection, not only because the film has a good realistic touch but also because of the connection we make with the character (thanks to his good sense of humor).Not only in humanity and philosophical aspects that the film is impressive, but as said before this is a aliens movie, there couldn't be only a drama as 'Signs'. District 9 brings a good set of action with laser guns, thanks to good reality of the film, we can even see the reaction of a human body when it receives a shot of a laser gun (don't let fragile kids watch the movie).'District 9' can be one of the best (if not the best after 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind') Aliens movies ever made. Along with a great mix of clichés and a good human philosophy, maintaining a good line of entertainment with spectacular action scenes and superb visual effects, is a film to be seen at least once in your lives.",9,1,2,16 July 2013
Batman Begins," 'Sometimes ... a man rises...from the darkness ...', and sometimes a movie does too, and this movie is the proof!
","1989-1992 Tim Burton made two classic Batman films ('Batman' and 'Batman Returns'), just great and must-watch movies. In 1995, Joel Schumacher did 'Batman Forever', which actually was a good movie, but with only a good and perfect performance (Jim Careey -The Ridler). And then, in 1997, Schumacher completely ruined the franchise with the film stupidly stupid 'Batman and Robin', ruining and destroying the Batman franchise forever, being vanished from Hollywood what seemed to be forever. Eight years later, in 2005, it was given the task for Christopher Nolan to resurrect the franchise from the dead, some liked the idea, others thought it was going to be another horrible movie, and it was?! Far, FAR from it! 'Begins' tells the story of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), who as a child saw his parents die in front of him during a robbery. Years pass and Bruce returns to his hometown Gotham City for the final judgment of Chill, the murderer of his parents. Bruce planned to kill him with his father pistol at the end of the trial. But before Bruce could have the chance, a woman kills Chill at close range, because Chill had secrets from the big criminal mind of the city, Carmine Falcone (Tom Wikinson). After that Bruce leaves the city and begins a journey around the world with the mission of knowing and understand the criminal minds and tries to somehow tackle corruption and violence of his city. And then he meets Ducard (Liam Neeson) who offers Bruce the chance and the weapons to fulfill its mission. Months later Bruce returns to Gotham with the help of his butler and best friend Alfred (Michael Caine). Now more mature and decided, Bruce begins to do justice with his own hands, but not as the man Bruce Wayne, but with his new identity, 'Batman'.What Nolan begins to resurrect the franchise is not only putting the story more mature and also full of action without exaggeration (not lacking in this film), is doing the character of Bruce Wayne relevant. In previous films, Bruce Wayne was only the rich guy who decided to do justice, and his main concern was to hide his superhero identity out of the press. Here, it is also that, much better, but also humanizes the character. For the first time we see the man behind the mask, making him a relatable character (thus, making us finally to worry about his character). All thanks to a superb storytelling that Nolan gives the film, giving dialogs tat flows perfectly to the characters and for the first time a superheroes movie really well written and also we feel that everything in the story is real, that it could really happen in our world.Nolan was only known for the magnificent 'Memento' and the underrated 'Insomnia', both were known for their realistic style that works very well in this movie as well. Since Batman's car and gadgets, all with their scientific explanations (all possible, look it up), and even the Gotham City (filmed in Chicago). Nolan makes Gotham the economic center of America, but also the center of corruption and violence (New York ¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬plus Chicago). Making with the obscure style of the first films of Burton, while keeping the realism.Great story and excellent direction, but also their characters guarantee the final success. Nolan surprisingly, even not faithfully following the comic-book, he manage to bring to the movie many of the characters (even some that not major fans knew that existed). Christian Bale simply superb both as Bruce Wayne and Batman (in my opinion the best Batman actor who ever had); Liam Neeson as mentor (and a surprise later) simply excellent; Michael Caine is superb, capturing the spirit of Alfred , loyal and funny; Gary Oldman also captures the spirit of Commissioner Gordon perfectly, stubborn and smart with a hatred of injustice and corruption; Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox (nor I knew he existed), the inventor of the hero's gadgets, and captures the right philosophy that he and Bruce Wayne had in the comic, if Lucius knew or not that Bruce was the masked man, always a mystery.Even not faithfully following the comic and realizing the dreams of fans, Nolan resurrected the franchise completely. Managing to capture the spirit of the only superhero without powers, putting a dark and even a cop-thriller tone to the history. Also bringing heart and soul to the character of Bruce Wayne, and all the other characters thanks to an excellent narrative; superb direction really well action packed. What at first was to be a prequel to the classic Burton was the great beginning of one of the best trilogies ever made.9/10",10,0,1,15 April 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 'From the Smallest begins ... Becomes the greatest legend' Peter Jackson has maken a point on this prhase.
","After The Lord of the Rings (best trilogy ever made), in which each film was truly a masterpiece, rumors emerged years later saying that Peter Jackson would make the movie 'The Hobbit' inspired by the work of Tolkien, which tells the story before the events of Lord of the Rings, Mr. Jackson denied everything saying it had closed its vision of Middle-earth, and in 2011 the team from the original trilogy was reunited with Peter Jackson at the command, promising a new trilogy.Months passed and I was dying with anxiety to see the film; trailers for the film appeared; I get even more anxious. And finally ... in December I attended on opening day of 'Un Enexpected Journey' and was just ... FANTASTIC. I'm still impressed with Peter Jackson, he never disappoints in his films, and this is another proof that he is one of the best directors in the business. And so he remains faithful to Tolkien's work is impressive, clear that this was the 1st film in the trilogy, here we can see the first 6 chapters of the book, it also means that there will be much ahead.Jackson in this film focuses attention on things that have not been explored much in the Lord of the Rings, the Dwarfs for example, in the Lord of the Rings we only saw one, we see 13 in this one; in the Lord of the Rings we saw an army of goblins, in this one we see an infestation. And it's much more fun, with scenes of dying laughing and you get to love the characters.The characters are superb, Ian McKellen as Gandalf as always badass and fantastic, Martin Freeman just transform himself to Bilbo (main character), and Andy Serkis as Gollum / Smeagol without words, he is more real than ever. Special effects on top of the range, with extremely epic and fantastic scenes, with a Excellent soundtrack. And always staying faithful to the original trilogy, and books.A film that in my opinion is for the whole family laugh, have fun, and if you are emotive might even cry.",9,1,4,16 April 2013
Saving Private Ryan," The Second best war movie ever made is a timeless experience!
","Spielberg during his career has always shown a certain interest for the World War II, in movies like '1941', 'Empire of the Sun', 'Schindler's List' and of course 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'The Last Crusade' that was perfect clear. He affirmed that in a interview that he considers the WWII one of the most significant events of the last hundred years, and always sought to portray it somehow. It took the screenwriter Robert Rodat and Tom Hanks to show to Spielberg a story almost like 'Apocalypse Now', inspired by an event of the civil war, taking place during the Second World War, to the master retract the war in the best way (possibly) ever made.'Saving Private Ryan' is takes place soon after the invasion of the Normandy at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944. With Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) getting a mission, coming from the General George C. Marshall itself, to rescue a paratrooper private James Ryan (Matt Damon) who lost three brothers in combat, two on D-Day and one in New Guinea. Now the Captain along with 7 of his best men have to travel in the middle of the war in France and cross enemy lines to save the life of a man who doesn't even know. But the dangers and sacrifices will bring challenges and moral dilemmas to the soldiers and their mission.When I said that Spielberg retracted the WWII in the best way ever made I wasn't bluffing. Of course he showed the consequences of the Holocaust in a terrifying and brilliantly in his masterpiece 'Schindler's List'. But here, Spielberg completely redefines the genre of war films forever. What was always shown (except for 'Apocalypse Now') always with a romantic and patriotic story, Spielberg manages to show its brutality.Many today consider this film the best war movie ever made, and others think 'Apocalypse Now' already occupies this place. Both films follow different paths and tones, but tell a story very similar with almost the same dilemma: 'The sacrifice of many lives by one live'. But Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' went much further than that, exploring the psychological and disturbing side of the Vietnam War including its origins without ever taking a patriotic side as Spielberg does here momentarily. So 'Apocalypse' is by a far superior film.What Spielberg and screenwriter Robert Rodat do is follow a simpler path but still excellent. Showing for several moments in the film dilemmas about saving a man in the middle of hell. And that leads to relationship of the soldiers, that early in the film was a brotherhood of partnership, begins to fade with the sacrifices being made by a soldier who they never saw or met and it is probably dead. But there is where one of the few of the problems in the film appear, some of the characters deserved a better development but anything ruins our feelings at the end of the film.Well, so far I've only been talking about moral dilemmas and comparisons. Now let's cut to the part where Spielberg revolutionizes everything, in his direction. Coppola gave in 'Apocalypse' the classic 'nalpam' bombing of the village, followed with marines stealing surfboards and surfing. Spielberg gave the best battles and shootings ever made and put in a war movie. Literally putting us in the middle of the flying bullets and explosions hurting our ears. And for the people that still criticize Spielberg for making children's and cheesy films, get ready to see bodies being mutilated and blood splash on your face. Showing the terrible reality and brutality of war, the real hell.In the performances level, the film doesn't disappoint at all. Each of the 8 (9 if you count Ryan at the end of the movie, oh, spoiler). Since Barry Pepper as the best sniper in a movie since Robert De Niro; Tom Sizemone as the best partner to have in a battlefield, and Tom Hanks as Tom Hanks is, simply brilliant.While not be the best war movie ever made (thanks to Coppola), 'Saving Private Ryan' is a essential viewing film. Spielberg through another magnificent direction shows the cruel reality and brutality of war, coated with bright dilemmas thanks to Rodat's script, presented with yet another brilliant performance by Tom Hanks. 'Saving Private Ryan' is not perfect or the best war movie ever made, but it is sure a timeless war and movie classic.10/10",10,2,3,7 November 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," The mother of all Epics is a true cinema miracle
","The epic of the epics, the film that if never had been done, not only today's cinema wouldn't be the same but we would never know the great man that was T.E Lawrence.'Lawrence of Arabia' was the epic that redefined cinema forever, not only gave us a cinematic spectacle of grandeur but also gave us one of the most beautiful stories ever told in cinema.By the beginning, the film suggests that it is a biography (which partly is) where we witness Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) suffering a motorcycle accident that leads him to a terrible death. Then the movie jumps to a younger Lawrence, a young playful, petulant and worship lieutenant, that is being highlighted for a mission in the desert that at the beginning was just a reconnaissance mission that ended up being one of the salvations of the 1st world war.Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson not only try to show the historical side of the film featuring various encounters and battles that marked the history (which are well represented in the film) but mainly it tries to show the man that was Thomas Edward Lawrence ('T.E' get it?). Lawrence was mostly known for being a hero by some and a charlatan or sadist by others, the film shows that with a tremendous mastery that try to say that Lawrence was much more than that, he was a human like any other.Lawrence establishes several visions of himself throughout the film: at the beginning for his comrades English he is a young petulant and playful lieutenant; later for his Arabs comrades a true messiah that crosses whole deserts without tiring and joins people without rivalry; and later by their British comrades a petulant and playful and very courageous now Major. Even nourishing various visions throughout the film, the script never loses focus giving a great evolution of the character and also the historic events in their correct time line, always with an amazing mastery.The story itself is already beautiful but the direction of David Lean makes it magnificent. A film that seems to improve with each passing scene and also gives the film an incredible magnitude with lush landscapes of the Arabian desert. Not only landscapes but also the incredible epic battles, one that stands out is the massive invasion of the city of Aqaba filmed in a large-scale placing the huge Arab army in one shot of the camera during the massive invasion. Such a scene would be filmed today with the use of visual effects, losing the brilliance of David Lean magic that is felt in each of his scenes throughout the film.The cast also stands out without difficulty; each of the historical figures had superb performances since Omar Sharif as Sheriff Ali to Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal. All great in their roles, but who stands out with a lush performance is undoubtedly the great Peter O'Toole as Lawrence, showing his character the man that Lawrence was from a playful to rebel; from peaceful to a warrior; from a English gentleman to an Arab messiah, all in with a great perfection.If one word could describe the masterpiece of David Lean it would undoubtedly be magnificent. Everything works marvelously since the pacing to a brilliant script and a lush direction that tells's the incredible journey of a man in a film that goes from a huge adventure to a war epic. 'Lawrence of Arabia' is the miracle of cinema, an epic film that is seriously required to be seen by all cinema lovers.",10,1,3,23 July 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Best...prequel...ever!
","The film surprised me, when it was announced, I did not trust a lot. The 1968 classic is a Mastepiece, and over the years have been made ​​horrible remakes, and I thought this would be no different. After I saw the movie, I apologize to Ruppert Wart and Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa. The movie is fantastic, it's one of the best reboots ever made, is super loyal to the 1968 classic stories and characters, but also focuses on reality, what would happen if super intelligent monkeys started a revolution against humans today? The monkeys are not smart suddenly because of magic or steroids, it was all genetics, and it was not on purpose that any scientist wanting to be famous starts creating intelligent apes, it was all an accident (see the movie and will understand better). After an accident in the lab because of an experiment of a medicine, all the monkeys are killed, and a scientist finds a baby ape and brings him to save his life. After a few days the scientist begins to see that the little monkey has an advanced intelligence. Months pass and the monkey grows to a fantastic evolution, that is where the movie touches a very good point, evolution. After a domestic accident, the poor monkey is taken away, and we see at the beginning of that evolution becomes revolution. The cast is solid, James Franco is an actor who is fantastic here, but he is not the main character, but Andy Serkys that is the primate Ceasar. Another point where the film does a good touch, does not focus attention on the human but in primates. The monkeys are computerized and so much realistic, Andy Serkis becomes a monkey in person. And he is a BADASS monkey. Rise of the Planet of the apes is fantastic, not disappointed, just thought it could have been longer. And the sequels are confirmed, we'll see if there do not disappoint.",9,1,2,15 April 2013
City of God," The most realistic movie ever made!
","CITY OF GOD, critically acclaimed, loved by many, considered the best movie in Brazilian cinema, this is all true ...? Yes, probably. Many people told me that this movie was a MASTERPIECE (agree), others said it was too exaggerated (shut up), well, here's what I think! This movie is EXCELLENT, period. Shows what life is like in one of several favelas of Rio de Janeiro for these children and young people growing up in a world of violence. Buscapé (main character) is a boy like any other that has dreams to realize: be a reporter; having a girlfriend; cash in his wallet. Dreams difficult to achieve in this slum standing gang war between Zé Pequeno (also main character) and Mané Galinha, for reasons both territory and personal revenge. Where we see also the lives of many people in this slum, his experiences and his thoughts on life as they have. And the most impressive in this film is the casting. In the film we can only see a maximum of 2 actors, because all other characters including the main character, are even people who live in the favela City of God, and they make everything real (the film is based on true events if you do not know). In the end, this movie is fantastic and truly a classic!",10,2,4,16 April 2013
Django Unchained," 'I like the way you do movies boy!'
","Tarantino does not disappoint. His classic bloodbaths, intriguing dialog and black humor finally had a tribute that is 'Django Unchained.' Many people did not like the movie or for being too silly, or too long, or excessive violence. Will a Tarantino fan crazy as me, to realize the enormity of the great masterpiece that 'Django' can be? Not only is one of the best of Tarantino movies, but it is the tribute that the writer-director make to his films, giving a demonstration of who he is and its material.Django is arguably the greatest production of Tarantino, but I know that size does not make the content, but greater in everything. Here we see the combination of the various elements of Tarantino's films, the title character and history elements, are there all together, just pay attention.At the beginning we see Django (Jamie Fox) as a poor, simple and sufferer slave, who meets the great Dr. King Schultz (Crhistoph Waltz), and with him the chance of vengeance of his old owners, and later regaining his love Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), these first 45 minutes of the film we see how Django grow both spiritually and mentally and becomes a killing machine that becomes later. Also in these first few minutes of the film we see elements of 'Kill Bill,' for example, the Bride of Uma Thurman, a sufferer with visions of the past in search of redemption and revenge against those who took her all what he loved. Django is her male version, and as The Bride is an expert on samurai swords, Django is in revolvers.In the next two hours we see the plan that Django and Schultz plan, a foolproof plan to recover the wife of Django from the cruel Calvin Candlie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a plan that seems to be impossible to know when Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). In these two hours we see elements of 'Inglourious Basterds' and 'Pulp Fiction'. From 'Inglourious' is the plan that seems foolproof that will lead to an enhuge end with small twists and obstacles ahead, along with an intriguing dialog scenes, as the dinner scene where the 5 characters are connected in one intriguing line of dialog that lead's to the unexpected end, such as scene that resembles the scene of the German Pub. From 'Pulp' is the friendly and contradictory partnership between Django and Schultz, that closely resembles the duo Vincent and Jules. Two people who are very friendly and respect one another but a small rivalry between the two in what has regarding their attitudes or as Schultz says 'getting dirty'. The end of the second act, delivering the third and final act where the unexpected happens, like any Tarantino movie, a tremendous scale of grandeur.Django might not show a Western as we think it would, mainly because the film is set in the American South, being then a Southern, but 'Inglourious Basterds' did not show much of the war and not the situation of the Jews (only the beginning) and focuses attention on killing Nazis. Tarantino uses the environment to explore the southern's slavery that existed in America during the time, but at the same time maintaining the elements of a Western, not getting shot during a firefight; a small town with a old sheriff with a dirty past; a lone ranger looking for redemption.At the same subject, the characters, all well-established, and in them we can see several elements of other Tarantino films. Django seems a mixture of Jackie Brown, The Bride and Vincent See, all alike in gestures and attitudes but also their situation in the whole plot. A character a bit shy but very smart and they can even be BADASS, and their situations in the story that almost seems to be a secondary character; Schultz looks a bit like Winnfiel Jules (Pulp Fiction) and Max Cherry (Jackie Brown), a character cultured with a very particular vision of the world and with his own philosophy of what is good; Stephen is the mixture of Marcellus Wallace (Pulp Fiction) and Ordell Robbie (Jackie Brown), a 'n#' who thinks superior to all others and can be really cruel. The only character who seems to be the same original was Calvin Candie, a cynical and cruel slave owner.Many complain that Django can hardly stands out in the film being the main one, but how many times in Tarantino's previous films the main character was half out when the secondary characters spoke. But here the very minor characters seem to stand out when they talk among themselves. When is a scene of Schultz, Calvin begins to talk stealing his scene; when is a scene of Calvin, Stephen starts talking and steals his scene; when is a scene is Stephen, Schultz starts talking and steals his scene. And so it goes on in this dialog triangle of secondary characters, and all of them in the Badass voice of Django appears as a roller-coaster doing everything shake. This just proves that Tarantino can still do screenplays with mastery and persuasion.The performances of the entire cast can also be fantastic, on the style of Tarantino, Jamie Fox can install itself in the world of Tarantino with a performance that is the beginning of a simpleton slave until its evolution into a BADASS lone-ranger; Chistoph Waltz superb as always and once again manages to be the favorite character of the movie for those who attend; Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances; Samuel L. Jackson proving to be one of the best supporting actors in the business. All amazing as the movie itself.'Django Unchained' manages to be one of the funniest films of Tarantino, but also one of the most intriguing ones, with a really well written screenplay. A great product delivery that Tarantino has always given us and as always challenging and causing controversy in society, proving that it still has much to give.",10,6,12,16 April 2013
Drive," Best Art-house movie ever made, with shi#t blowing up!
","Nicolas Winding Refn, the Danish director of 'Art -House' genre, who already had explored various themes in his films with a beautiful-looking: the Danish mafia in the 'Pusher' trilogy; a violent prisoner in 'Bronson'; a mute-dumb badass Viking without an eye in 'Valhalla Rising'; all with a beautiful direction and full of metaphors on the subject on study, and FULL of violence. But his greatest critical success and ultimately the public's attention would be with this masterpiece! 'Drive' tells the story of Ryan Gosling's character, a mysterious man with several jobs: one as a part-job being a movie-stuntman making stunts with cars; the rest of the day as a mechanic; at night he enters in the world of crime as a getaway driver. Everything seems to change in his life when thanks to his boss of the workshop, Shannon (Bryan Cranston), the driver begins to approach his neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), who has a long nurtured passion. Days pass and the driver gets closer and closer of Irene and her son creating a great relationship. But everything changes when Irene's husband returns from prison bringing with it immense dangers to the only family that the Driver ever had.I know, the synopsis sounds like another cliché action movie with a badass character, but that's where the genius of the film begins. Nicolas Winding Refn is known for putting in his films varied metaphors in the topic to be explored. And what is the topic of the movie? Well, it is simply the action genre (a theme exploring another theme, intriguing right?). Perhaps this is the reason for the poor reception that the film had with the young crowd, the trailers and synopsis sounded like a good action movie just for good popcorn, and ended up going much deeper than that, but all the clichés are here.Gosling's character is the typical movie's action hero: don't talk much and when he speaks are phrases that make you crack a smile on your face and think (wow, what a badass); know how to handle weapons well and never gets hurt after a fight; drive cars as a master engaging in awesome car- chases; and of course, has a soft heart. Nicolas along with screenwriter Hossein Amini try to explore the human side of this type of hero, they are human with its good and pure side, but at the same time dark and violent side. Giving the film a lot of metaphors.Nicolas is known for its intense moments of silent in his films that many consider boring, but serve as reflective moments. Here, these moments are not only reflective but show the reality of the film (come on, ask yourself, how many times have you been in a room with someone you doesn't know without saying word embarrassed? Neither the badass hero escapes this.). And this is possibly the film of Nicolas with more people talking, even the driver (no main character of the films Nicolas almost never said a word), giving the film an excellent, realistic and even humorous narrative to its characters.In technical aspects, the film is almost perfect. As always, Nicolas deliver's a beautiful direction and the right use of lighting and slow motion at the silent and dialog moments, and also the superb action scenes. And the movie contains a varied and beautiful soundtrack; all songs have the same theme, what is to be a hero, also serving as a metaphor.In performances, all exceptional: Ryan Gosling predictably has an extraordinary performance, even not speaking much he shines as the troubled-badass hero in the quest to be a good person; Bryan Cranston, if you ever watched 'Breaking Bad' knows how great it is here. He also another cliché in the movie, at the same time he is the old mentor he is the comic-relief; Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman as the villains Bernie and Nino, both superb but also serve as a metaphor for the story, even the bad guys are human villains with their own problems.Surely, the masterpiece of Nicolas, a magnificent direction, with a great narrative, splendid performances. All together and put into a theme that seemed inexorable, that ended up being an excellent aesthetic and human study of the action genre in perhaps the best art -house movie ever made, with amazing sh#t blowing up.9/10",9,2,3,26 September 2013
Good Will Hunting," Matt Damon + Ben Affleck = Genius Duo!
","A movie that amazed me from start to finish. The way that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote this amazing story about a 'bad boy disturbed' that the inside is a true genius. And that just needs help not only to show it to the world, but for himself, and at the same time helping those around you, but this is a short summary of what this Masterpiece has to give. Matt Damon it is superb, and it grabs his character (which he wrote) so impressive and credible; Robin Williams in one of his best roles, his character is the most beloved and fun (and a little perturbed), the entire cast does a phenomenal job, Stellan Skarsgård, Minnie Driver, Ben Affleck, all perfect. The film teaches us that we all have a soul mate, not a romantic, but one that challenges us and transforms us what we are in the future ... (I wish have both). A film very well done, very well written, we laugh, we cry, we learn, we see things in a differently way. And for all who feel alone in their lives, I just say ... 'It's not your fault!'",9,1,3,15 April 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Part 2 of the longest movie ever made!
","The longest movie ever made, so long that the director had to divide it in three parts, and that's why people call a trilogy. 10 hours of a phenomenal spectacle that will leave anyone with tears and a heavy heart after the magnificent end.In 'The Fellowship of the Ring' we start with the journey of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) towards to Mordor, lair of the dark lord Sauron. And we see the great training and union of the Fellowship of the ring, an alliance of all the living beings of Middle-earth on a mission to destroy the 'One Ring' and thus save the world from the darkness.In 'Two Towers' we have the beginning of the Great War between humans and orcs, with the army of Saruman (Christopher Lee) marching against the kingdom of Rohan. And Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) along with the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) joining in the battle. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are getting closer every day to the lair of Sauron, now having the help of the strange creature Gollum / Smeagol (Andy Serkis) who wants by all means his 'precious'.And finally in 'The Return of the King' we have the spectacular ending to the trilogy / film. Since the beginning of the film we felt the feeling that everything is coming to an end. Frodo and Sam finally reached Mordor and try to find a way to infiltrate into the enemy territory and Gollum / Smeagol plans to take the ring from Frodo, who becomes increasingly heavy. And on the other side we have the beginning of the great battle that we expected since the first movie, the showdown between humans and orcs in the battle that will determine the fate of the world with all the characters we have learned to love here together in this fight to the uncertain ending.Peter Jackson (director-writer) brought to life the masterpiece of books, 'Lord of the Rings' by the genius JRR Tolkien. This can be the best adaptation of a book to film ever made, if the book is already a masterpiece in the world of books, Jackson made a masterpiece of cinema. The gigantic story that was told in six books, in film it was told in one film. A film of more than 10 hours, it had to be divided into three parts forming the best trilogy already made. I say it's just a movie because all three movies work as one, from the beginning to the end we realize that.Since the first film (or first part) we have the magic of Tolkien's working here, along with Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens (writers) have recreated and remained faithful to Tolkien's work and the film managed to raise the themes of friendship, courage and while it has always had religious references in the book and the film manages to convey everything in the greatest perfection.Not only the writing is phenomenal, but the visual effects are stunning giving a gigantic scale the movie, so well detailed visual effects that make everything look so realistic. And the effects are not only stunning but also that the soundtrack that is simply magnificent.A trilogy that works as a single film that is a true masterpiece. A landmark in film history thanks to excellent writing and direction of Jackson and fantastic performances from all the cast, 'The Lord of the Rings' is the epic fantasy stunning in every detail and be loved by all.10/10",10,0,1,7 October 2013
The Hurt Locker," One of the best War movie ever!
","After 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Apocalypse Now' I never thought that another filmmaker would make a war movie that managed to get to their feets ... Kathryn Bigelow succeeded in a FANTASTIC way.'The Hurt Locker' can be one of the best war movies of all time, explore and show's the Iraq war in a way never seen before, getting to be quite original in many details. One of the most positive and original points on the film is that it dosen't focus attention on shootings sequences as other war films do, but explores the view of the soldiers, as they see and feel the war, putting the public on their places. Who sees the war on television or news, just see unnecessary killing and massacre between peoples and nations, yeah it is true but then people say that the soldiers are murderers. The film manages to explore this sense from the perspective of the soldiers, they are only there to follow rules, their job is being there, the soldiers only have each other and fight to protect the man on their side, we see that they count the days they spend in combat to return home soon which seems impossible. Mark Boal gets conveying this with a superb screenplay, shows reality in an impressive way. Not only is the screenplay is very real but also the impressive visual details that the film delivers. Another plus point in the film are the visual effects, giving the film an visual magnitude, impressive in every passing moment, and with the direction of Kathryn Bigelow everything is just amazing.The cast could not have been better for the story of these soldiers. Jeremy Renner gives a fantastic performance in every detail as Sergeant First Class William James; Anthony Mackie as Sergeant JT Sanborn and more; Brian Geraghty; Guy Pearce and Ralph Fiennes.From start to finish, 'The Hurt Locker' gives an impressive view of the war in Iraq, stuffed maintenance; emotion; action and an impressive visual spectacle, one of the best war movies ever made.",9,0,3,15 April 2013
Lincoln," Another Steven Spielberg Masterpiece and another role where Lewis kill's!
","That's what happened, Steven Spielberg asked Robert Zemeckis to borrow him the car of Dr. Emmett, went back in time by 5 minutes before the death of Abraham Lincoln and brought him to the present and asked him to act as himself in the days before the 13th amendment been approved... that's what happened (just kidding)!'Lincoln' from start to finish is fantastic, the characters and the story are in the greatest perfection, Tony Kushner should have made a very careful study to present the historical facts in the film so perfect. The film from beginning seems boring, that's because it dosen't focus attention on the civil war (although it appears to be and the reason for all the confusion) but in the political area, during the civil war, the union government was in a total chaos, in one side the Republicans who wanted the approval of the 13th amendment and thus the abolition because they thought this was the only way the war has an end, and the other side the Democrats who wanted the opposite, but after the war but slightly modified.The politic in this movie it is very well built, and Spielberg can make it so exciting, and the historical picture that makes this film is fantastic, and the historical characters that make up the film are superb as Lincoln himself.And another positive point on the film is that it is not a biographic film about Lincoln, but in his last days of life, but throughout the film we can deduct his past, and the characters around him. We can see a Lincoln so realistic and perfect, we see the person he was, and his values, we see the hero he was.Daniel Day Lewis is PERFECT in every detail, his Lincoln is fantastic and so real, Sally Field fantastic as always, the wife of Lincoln smart and kind with a fantastic performance; Tommy Lee Jones nor comments, he indulges perfectly her character, the great Thaddeus Stevens, and the connection that Lincoln and Thaddeus has in the movie is so fantastic to see, all this phenomenal cast on their characters.'Lincoln' proves four things: Steven Spielberg continues to make FANTASTIC movies; Daniel Day Lewis is a PERFECT actor; politics can be exciting, and that there existed Man and women who have fought and are fighting for equality for all, and that historical films can be fun and be true MASTERPIECES.",10,1,2,16 April 2013
Children of Men," The guy who did the best adaptation of the Harry Potter saga, made ​​one of the best sc-fi movies ever. Hell Yeah!
","My experience with this film was the most high level of reality. From start to finish it is adrenaline and pure excitement. 'Children of Men' is the definitive extremely realistic experience of a sci-fi movie.The story begins with Theo Faron (Clive Owen) a journalist who lives in a near future in the year of 2027. A future where pregnancy in women's no longer exists. Theo lives in a chaotic and dangerous London where there is an insane persecution against illegal immigrants, placing them in 'concentration camps'. Theo walking in another normal day, he is suddenly captured by masked men and taken by a van. Theo wakes up and finds himself captured by his beautiful ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore) who is wanted for terrorism because she works with the 'Fishers' one rebel militia who fights against the government, helping immigrants. Julian says she needs Theo's help arranging passes out of the country for a young black woman, receiving 5000 pounds in return. Theo through some powerful contacts get the passes and makes a date with Julian and the young woman to deliver the passes. On another day like any other, Theo awakens, go attend a race of dogs and meets with Julian on a bus. From there, Theo and Julian head to a car and deliver the passes for the young and promises to help carrying her to a farm on the border of the country. During the trip, everyone laugh and have fun, suddenly appears a burning car in the middle of the road blocking the way and an army of hungry thugs starts attacking their car. During the attack Julian gets shot in the neck and dies. Later they manage to arrive on the farm. When Theo is ready to go back to London, he is called by the young Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) who wants to show you her secret, a secret that can save the world, she is pregnant. Now Theo is in the middle of a civil war and the only hope of the life of humanity.The idea of the story is excellent, and the way that Alfonso Cuarón (director-writer) and four writers, explore it in a tremendous reality and at the same time with elements of futuristic sci-fi giving a fantastic delivery. Along with moments that can be funny and entertaining with normal language and released as of today, alongside with strong emotional charges extremely strong that the audience faces throughout the film.But the technical aspects of the film are AWESOME. We are faced with a real huge production, giving us scenarios, places and landscapes frighteningly huge and realistic. And the direction of Cuarón is breathtaking. It literally puts the viewer in each scene, increasing the tension and suspense with every minute that passes, and the concern for the fate of the characters becomes really personal.One of the best sci-fi ever made, a direction and writing extremely superb, excellent performances (especially by Clive, fantastic as always), a future.... that I really expect that doesn't happen.",10,2,7,11 May 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," After 'Kill Bill', the blonde jokes changed....forever! (And this is the review from both Vol. 1 and 2)
","After the not so successful 'Jackie Brown,' Quentin Tarantino became a unknown and forgotten legend with only 3 films on his career. 6 Years later Tarantino confirmed his great return to filmmaking with 'Kill Bill' Vol. 1-2. Many did not believe: thought he had lost his originality; his style would never fix in this new generation, but boy, we were wrong.'Kill Bill', both part 1 and 2 show the great talent of Tarantino and shows why he is a true legend in cinema. Not only keeps its great and very intelligent originality but also makes a great tribute to the old Kung Fu and martial arts movies alongside with the old classic Western style, all in both Vols. that function as a single movie.The story begins, with another unforgettable character of Tarantino, 'The Bride' (Uma Thurman). A beautiful blond woman appearing punched and shot in the head at her wedding (that's why she is called the Bride, she was unmarked so the police dubbed in that way).Apparently she survived, and after a 4 years coma she wake up and find out that she had lost her baby (she was also pregnant). She swear it revenge against those responsible ... their former coworkers and her lover Bill (David Carradine). 'The Bride' was an assassin who worked for her lover, soon after she found out that was pregnant she run away from the killing business. After a few years their own former colleagues along with Bill went after her to put an end for this betrayal, but they only woke up a sleeping giant.In the 1st part of the story, we see 'The Bride' going after the first two targets on her list: O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) the queen of all the Japanese mafia; and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) a 'simple' housewife. In this first part Tarantino shows his great talent in making a bloody violence and also pays tribute to the old kung fu and martial arts movies, all together delivering a bloody battle between 'The Bride' and 'The Crazy 88s' (the private army of teen's samurai working for O-Ren) with a direction that is simply superb.In part 2 we continue with the great quest of vengeance of 'The Bride' after the other names on her list: Budd (Michael Madsen) the lazy good-hearted own Bill's brother; and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) the cruel new lover of Bill; and also, the man itself, finally in person...Bill. Part 2 differs a bit from Part 1. While the 1st is seemed a crazy and beautiful martial-arts film, the 2nd part is also crazy but now is a true modern Western with angry blondes killing themselves. Not only in action scenes (which are few here) that Tarantino excels directing, but also delivers a fantastic and original writing giving dialogs full of Tarantino smartness and a fun black humor.Not only that Tarantino is highlighted with a brilliant screenplay and his stylish direction but also the entire cast that fits perfectly into Tarantino style. All simply excellent: Michael superb; David Carradine fantastic as ever; Uma Thurman.... PERFECT, badass, suffering, hilarious, unforgettable.'Kill Bill' was the big return of Tarantino to show that he came to stay. With a story very well written and directed together with unforgettable characters, with Tarantino style more enhanced conquering fans of this generation and won even more in the future but not forgetting this unforgettable classic.",10,2,5,27 June 2013
The Dark Knight," 'Now...let's put a smiley on that face!'
","Christopher Nolan, the man who brought the classic superhero Batman franchise back to life with the great movie 'Batman Begins', now he brings its sequel that is not only the best superhero film ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made.'The Dark Knight' once again brings, as we witnessed in 'Batman Begins' a mature vision of our superhero, keeping reality and maturity. But it doesn't stand only like a superhero movie with superb action scenes, but keeps a frenetic pace of a thriller with twists every half hour.The story continues where 'Batman Begins' ended with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) who continues his struggle against the organized crime in Gotham with his other identity of the dark vigilante, Batman. Gotham's crime decreases every day with the help of Batman / Bruce and the efforts of the Gotham police led by the Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman). But the appearance of the Joker (Heath Ledger), a psychopath criminal who turns out to be more dangerous and clever (and funny) than previous enemies that Batman / Bruce faced. Launching a powerful anarchy in Gotham leaving her in utter total chaos of fear, because fear is ultimately the most powerful weapon that exists.The mature vision of Nolan in his adaptation may not be very faithful to the comic (although many of the characters of BDs are present here), but gives a mature and realistic vision of the superhero, as how he it would be in our real world and the consequences of his enemies. The Joker always were the great rival of Batman in the comics and in the film also manages to be, he is not to be underestimate.While the movie is about superheroes and villains, in the same time it has an electrifying pace, it's a no stopping thriller. But it never fails to send messages of what a true hero is, and what he is willing to sacrifice for those he loves and protects.The cast is absolutely terrific, Christian Bale is fantastic as always as both Bruce Wayne and Batman delivering a fantastic performance. But the performance who stands out is Heath Ledger who is just PERFECT as one of the best villains ever created in comics, now also in film.Thanks to the genius mind of Nolan, 'The Dark Knight' is not an ordinary superhero film as 'Spiderman', 'X-Men' or the 1st Superman (which are also great movies), but stands by the mature and real vision of a superhero in our modern time giving us a electrifying action, suspense and drama show that is not only the best superhero film ever made but also one of the best masterpieces of cinema till today.",10,0,1,31 May 2013
2001: A Space Odyssey," Stanley Kubric's Masterpiece???? Yeah, maybe!
","'2001: A Space Odyssey' is the 4th film of the genius Stanley Kubrick that not only manages to be one of his best films but one of the most beautiful masterpieces ever made in the history of cinema.The story is not like a space adventure as the title seems to sound; it is much deeper than that. It all begins when a strange interference is captured within the Lunar surface. Dr. Heywood R. Floyd (William Sylvester) is highlighted to go on a mission along with other scientists to investigate the source of this interference. After reaching their destination they find a strange object, like a giant chocolate bar which seems be the source of the interference. When the scientists touch in the strange object their ears are invaded with a annoying sound. Six months later, a new team of six scientists are deployed to discover what happened to the other team and trace the source of interference that seem to be moving around the Lunar surface. Most of the team this time it is on hibernation while the scientists Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) control the ship with the intelligent-computer HAL 9000 voiced by Douglas Rain. The trip seems to go fine until HAL identifies a problem on the ship and the scientists go investigate, but the two men barely knows the true intentions of HAL to do with the mission and the strange object.This film was a big change that the sci-fi genre begins to take, thanks to Kubrick and his beautiful and brilliant visual effects giving us beautiful scenery of the vast space. But this is not mere sci-fi whatsoever, the mission only serves as basis for the further philosophical 'study' that Kubrick makes about the evolution of living beings, not just humans. The strange object has to do with all this, but it is also the real mystery of the film. But thanks to the writing of Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, makes everything so simple and beautiful.A true masterpiece of cinema, a classic that changed the sci-fi genre forever, along with a fantastic writing and direction and also the unforgettable and terrifying HAL, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is one of the most beautiful masterpieces that Kubrick had gave to the 7th Art.",10,0,1,4 June 2013
Avatar," 2.782.252.172 Billion dollars!
","The return of James Cameron to the great cinema, with the movie Avatar, and what a return. Avatar is simply something unprecedented, Cameron excelled, he takes on the story of Pocahontas (more or less) and makes a MASTERPIECE.Cameron has created an entire world that is Pandora, with places full of mysteries to unravel (more or less like a second Middle Earth), but in a world totally different and beautiful to look at. The film's visual effects are simply PERFECT. Not only, but created a language and a people, the Navi. The way that Cameron creates is that people master, are a people 'indigenous-alien' with its own language, which seems so real throughout the film. The film is not only real but also in environment the people themselves, the dialogs between the characters are so real that when you watch your mind looks like it will explode. Just proves that James Cameron is a master at doing more screenplays. The soundtrack nor comet, simply perfect, is one of the other to exciting and dramatic. The cast think it's fantastic, could not ask for more. Sam Worthington proves he can be a really good actor; Zoe Saldana continues be sexy even when she is in a blue-alien body; and we still have Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Giovanni Ribisi, all doing an amazing job.All in all, I think 'Avatar' is amazing and epic, a real MASTERPIECE from cinema by James Cameron, where I laughed, cried and jump of my chair throughout the all movie, I fell in love with the characters, and Pandora, and I'm anxious to get back to it, we see how there will be sequels.",9,1,3,15 April 2013
The Artist," Can somebody please give a Oscar for the dog?!!
","The first time I heard of this film was in 2012 Oscar's ceremony, I thought the Academy was exaggerating giving Oscars for this movie. 'A film black and white to win five Oscars, while old classics never won one?' As I was being stupid about it, I decided to watch the movie to judge it and make a bad review about it, I was determined to do it ... I'm a very different person today. After the end, I was delighted me with a FANTASTIC film, I was surprised with everything. Michel Hazanavicius, who directed the 'OSS 117' films, recreated the magic of the old cinema in a fantastic way. Grab on classics like 'Casablanca', 'Citizen Kane', and 'Charlie Chaplin' films, mixing them all, and pum ... The Artist born, and born-it good. The greatest example of the old cinema in this film is the fact that there is no sound, only the background music to acting, movie magic alive every second of this movie. Jean Dujardin fully deserves his Oscar in this movie, the way it fits in the film and his character, and makes it so alive and so real ... is perfect, just that. Bérénice Bejo also not left out, she's quite superb, as John Goodman, James Cromwell, and the entire cast is fantastic in their roles. I laughed, I cried, I was completely charmed by the film. I recommend to all to all.",10,3,5,16 April 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Sci-fi + Drama + Kubrick = A MASTERPIECE
","What kind of movie is this? A drama about life? A film about the life of crime? A Sci-Fi? A film about or against violence? Well, maybe everything I just said and more! The story is about Alex 'DeLarge' (Malcolm McDowell), a young teenager, music lover of Beethoven, who lives a life of what he calls 'ultra-violence'. He and his small group of criminals terrorize London night with all imaginable kinds of crimes, from rape to assaulting houses and beating up on thugs. After all 'the fun' Alex returns home and pretends to be the boy behaved that works to help people during the night. When he's line of crime reaches a point where he is arrested and sentenced to 14 years in prison.2 years of knocks and suspensions, Alex hears about a program that could take him out of prison soon. Little does he know that this will take him to an even worse situation.Interesting story does in it? Despite the fact it took years until his debut and premiered when he was attacked viciously by critics. Well, let's continue with the review of this masterpiece.Kubrick manages to make a film in a breathtaking by every minute that passes. The film is narrated in an exploitative and satirical language, even the dialogs between the characters can have a language satirical and exploitative, Alex is a great proof of that. Each of his words to the group and all other characters is all Shakespearean, we watch the film as if we be reading a dark and gloomy poem (like Alex himself). But every moment Kubrick doesn't resist putting the little British dark humor, letting the film be it pure entertainment at some point.The disturbing scenes that plague the film (which are many, no spoilers) are filmed in a even disturbing way. The use of image and cinematography that Kubrick's use is disturbing as fascinating, framing in an impressive way.A mixture of themes that Kubrick uses in the film is also a point to be brilliant. The use of drama in the story of Alex, while a hint of dark humor. Alex's vision of the world as a violent place where violence is to be made. And while it can have a cultured and intellectual mind with books and classical music.The time when Alex is arrested and have entered the small program where he is just a guinea pig, for much less than he knows what it is, it will totally change his life and his mind, with that Kubrick's make's a entry of sci-fi so impressively. Then with the return of Alex to the world now as a completely changed man, suffering, tragedy and drama again re-enters in the film, and criticizes the society (even unpredictable in the film) and for the first time we start feeling sorry for Alex's character.The performances are all excellent, Malcolm McDowell gives a fantastic performance in all details, their eyes and their expressions get's better by every passing minute.A true masterpiece that manages to be so disturbing and interesting to watch. Move both mentally and exciting journey and when we watch the transformation of Alex and his world around. With a superb directing and writing and fantastic performances, 'A Clockwork Orange' is truly a masterpiece of centuries with total recommendation from my humble part.",10,2,4,16 April 2013
Reservoir Dogs," This movie was the way that Tarantino tried to say: THIS IS ME, AND THIS IS MY MATERIAL, GET USE TO IT!
","If Tarantino is nowadays a legend of cinema, was because of this film; if today's movies have black humor with violence was because of this movie; if Tarantino's films are all great, the 1st would be no different. That's 'Reservoir Dogs', the 1st deliver from the master Tarantino movie! As I mentioned before, 'Reservoir Dogs' was the great presentation of Tarantino into cinema and the beginning of his lineage of insane dialogs, filled with black humor and violence drenched in blood and even more with unforgettable characters, none of that is missing here in 'Reservoir'.Everything starts with 8 guys hanging out in a restaurant to discussion about the meaning of the song 'Like a Virgin' by Madonna and also about give tips to the waitresses, whether they are fair or not. Right there at in the beginning we see the philosophy of Tarantino with a simple, intelligent and humorous dialog between these eight characters that have a strange chemistry. But later found out that the group was planning an assault, we deduce that went terribly wrong when we see Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) bathed in blood with a shot in the belly and with the desperate Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) taking him into a warehouse, the supposed meeting point. Soon after enters the 'professional' Mr. Pink claiming that someone has betrayed them, that there was a snitch among the group. According to the assault, the survivors arrive one by one: the sinister Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) and the nervous Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn) and the tension between the 8 men increases.But Tarantino already had his style of different perspectives of a story right at the beginning of his career, throughout the film the story not only focuses attention on the warehouse and increasing tension between the men, but most of the time does flashbacks of each the characters showing how they planned the robbery and what went wrong on it and who is the snitch of the group. All this followed by an excellent writing and direction from Tarantino, full of black humor and racist references and insane dialogs with various themes somehow connected to the story and with the delicious and terrifying violence. But Tarantino not only directs but it also acts as a member of the group, Mr. Brown, it was him that deduced the meaning of the song 'Like A Virgin' at the beginning.The cast, as in any Tarantino film, shines with excellent performances and its unforgettable characters. Harvey Keitel as always superb; Michael Madsen terrifying, Steve Buscemi as always weird and excellent, Tim Roth simply FANTASTIC.'Reservoir' was the big premiere of Tarantino in the 7th art with a fantastic writing and direction, with a superb cast and a insane at the same time fun story. 'Resevoir Dogs' was the first and memorable masterpiece of the legendary Quentin Tarantino.",10,0,0,16 June 2013
Pulp Fiction," The dialogs.....THE DIALOGS!
","A thriller? A black comedy? A romance? A film about the Mafia? A film with racial themes? After all, what kind of movie is 'Pulp Fiction'? The question still holds but thanks to the genius of Tarantino managed to mix different themes and make his masterpiece legendary. But after all, what it is 'Pulp Fiction'? As soon as the film begins when we are presented with a couple sitting in a roadside café starting to talk about ways to robber-it and then finally decide to rob the coffee after kissing up and exchanging compliments. We realize that we are not in a regular movie, because the movie is not just the story of this couple, we have several others that appear throughout the film, but all connected. The 'supost main character' Vincent (John Travolta) appears in three different stories, in one of them he is the 'bodyguard' of Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) the wife of his boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) and begins to feel attracted to her; in another story he is with his partner Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) trying to transmit a message to a group of guys who owns money to Marcellus Wallace; in another story he only makes an appearance in which is actually the story of Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) a fighter who works Marcellus Wallace which after a fight (which was supposed to lose) he tries to flee the country with his French girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros).Many other characters form the movie mixing in stories, each one with a different theme, but all have something alike, long dialogs. The film features unprecedented writing, addresses several topics, some do not have anything to do with the stories and the situations of the characters, but the way they are written in a way so simple and interesting is really from a true master on writing screenplays that is Quentin Tarantino. Despite having had help from Roger Avary on the screenplay this time, but all the ideas are still from Tarantino's mind, keeping his good dark-humor and his bloody fun violence.The film with so many stories, Tarantino mixes the different chapters leaving them out of order. Not to leave more confused but to leave the film more entertaining and extremely interesting with the insane dialogs between characters.A legendary film, excellent performances, perfect writing with interesting stories covering various topics and all very entertaining. Undoubtedly the best Tarantino film, a classic and a legendary masterpiece.",10,0,1,30 May 2013
The Godfather: Part III," Part 3 of the BEST movie ever made (here is the review from parts 1-2-3 together)!
","Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word 'perfection'? Well, 'The Godfather' parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely 'perfect' in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the 'American Dream'; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes 'The Godfather', the strongest brand of cinema till today 10/10",10,0,1,19 October 2013
The Departed," 'Goodfellas 2' only that they aren't friends
","34, 34 years of career as a filmmaker (one of the best who ever lived) Martin Scorsese after 18 films including masterpieces like 'Goodfellas', 'Ranging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver '. In 2006, 'The Departed' was the film that not only and finally gave the Oscar for Best Director to Scorsese, but it was the tribute that Scorsese did to all his work and the elements of his films that made him one of the greatest filmmakers of all time! The story takes place in the south of Boston where we find the police waging war on the Irish-American organized crime, and in the midst of all we found the rookie cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who gets in the investigation department of the investigators Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) and is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate headed by the crazy and smart Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Meanwhile we have the agent Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) the protected and informant of Costello, who joined the police to be Costello's contact inside the police, where Colin throughout his career start winning important position to gather and inform Costello plans and counter-plans against Costello's business mafia. But barely both moles know that the intrigue that connects both is much more dangerous than expected and it is all connected with Costello who has more secrets that they can imagine.'Departed' at the same time it is a new genre that Scorsese (who already had explored mafia thousands of times; the 'real ' death of Christ; a war hero that works in a cab and speaks to himself wearing underwear; boxing black and white; knights without armor with cars destroying asphalts; one film director who becomes schizophrenic pilot; the first new Yorkers gangs; and so on) were he gets in to, here he not only explores the genre of cop-thriller perfectly, but also makes a tribute to his old, violent, humorous style (not Tarantino, better).Since the beginning, the film follows with a fast pace, a real pace of a thriller, but thanks to the superb script of William Monahan the movie at the same time does a certain homage to 'Goodfellas' which also had a fast pace and was full of a hilarious black comedy, just like Departed. Also exploring the language and curse-language of Boston, but also the Irish language and their curse language, (one thing that at a certain point it had been explored in 'Gangs of New York').Not only is the script that makes a beautiful tribute and gives the film a great quality, but also the direction (truly deserving of an Oscar) from Scorsese, showing various places in the city of Boston and its culture (thing Scorsese has always done in his films, ALWAYS).Direction and script on top quality, but did the cast put up with the movie? Actually they carried the movie on their back, everyone simply phenomenal: Jack Nicholson nor comments, just put another role in his resume of exuberant performances; DiCaprio as ever with a stunning performance by giving the perfect Irish Americanized accent to his character; Matt Damon fits perfectly in his role as dirty-cop since the looks and sadistic smiles; and Mark Wahlberg was the only one to be nominated by the Academy (leaving the three monsters of acting film overlooked by the academy) but it wasn't for nothing delivering a superb performance from start to finish giving the perfect Boston accent.Hilarious, dark, nail biting thriller, the Masterpiece in which Scorsese pays tribute to his entire lineage of classic films presenting us with a beautiful direction, superb script and a luxury cast, 'The Departed' it may not be the best of Scorsese, but he showed us why we love him so much and his old and many more to come movies! 10/10",10,0,1,16 September 2013

Psycho," Best...nightmare...on real life...ever!
","'Psycho' is simply the best horror film ever made. The story is incredible, the acting is near perfection, the cinematography is awesome, the soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find is the Inability to stand the test of time. One of the Reasons the shower scene has become so notorious Is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in the shower was something no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing double-Jason Spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. Psycho its nothing like that, it's more! Aside from this though, the movie is flawless, the cinematography it's just incredible. The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh to the beautiful and sexy Marion Crane; Vera Miles to the Concerned sister; Lila Crane excellent; and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins to the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates. The film not only scares you a lot, but leaves you stuck on screen until the end of the movie, and only the strong survive's the insane dialogs, mentally, in the end, it will haunt you to the end of your lives, because ... I'AM NORMA BATES!",10,0,0,15 April 2013
War of the Worlds," 'Because any man dies...for nothing' So true!
","Both in 'Close Encounters of the Third kind' and 'ET' the Aliens are an advanced race seeking for peace. But when Spielberg wants to make them evil and scary, dam, he does very well. 'War of the Worlds' is the alien invasion movie from the master Spielberg. It is not his best film, but can be a great, tense, thrilling blockbuster.In the story we have Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), a divorced parent family of Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and Rachel (Dakota Fanning). When Ray's week with the children arrive, who he has a little distant relationship with his father. Begins a strange storm throwing huge rays on the ground. All electricity and cars stop working completely. And suddenly a huge mechanical robot leaves the ground and begins to disintegrate people. Ray gets in their children and arranges a car and tries to take them to Boston to be with his mother and keep the family together. Little does he know that it was not just that there was an attack, but in all parts of the country and the world. Now Ray has to carry your family for an America being totally destroyed.The story seems usual, but the way that the film focuses full attention on the family and on the way they do for America being destroyed gradually. And their relationship in the midst of all the chaos enhances itself every passing minute.The direction of Spielberg as always is spectacular and varied. Goes from insane persecution during the destruction of a city, a huge battle between alien's robots and military soldiers, and scenes of pure suspense. In technical aspects the film is fabulous. From aliens to the destruction of cities, the visuals are gorgeous so even with the sound effects. The soundtrack of John Williams again makes our heart flutter in scenes of pure suspense.The performances also stand out very well. Tom Cruise begins a little strange at first, but improves up every minute that passes; Dakota Fanning is superb; Tim Robbins, who only appears near the end, gives an excellent performance as the mad Harlan Ogilvy.It has everything to be one of the best movies ever made Aliens invasion. Excellent technical aspects, great performances, a good story, exciting and suspenseful moments. Another genre that Spielberg put in his career.",8,0,1,11 May 2013
There Will Be Blood," 'Draaaiiiiiiiinage boy!'
","A film that hits you like a fever, 'There Will Be Blood' is not the kind of movie that someone will have the pleasure of watching or reviewing. It is a portrait of several layers of everything that comes with the desire for power, will leave the audience feeling exhausted and with a bitter taste in the mouth.Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film is submitted safely and confidently. Anderson proves to be one of the best director of all time, a fact that is evident here. Packed with shots and scenes of breathtaking intensity of boiling, the film makes no apologies about his tendency toward grandiosity inherent in telling an epic story that spans decades.Perhaps the first thing that will strike viewers will use the images as dark and gloomy, almost impossible to see. We watched the movie as we were covered in oil. Batway, oil is simply the central theme of the film.The story begins with the oil tycoon Daniel Plainview, he is a very intelligent man and cruel that does whatever it takes to achieve your goals. He works hard, but he also takes advantage of the people around at your expense, if necessary. His business partner is his son H.W, that he actually 'acquired' when the H.W biological father, who worked on one of the platforms of Daniel, was killed in an accident at work. Daniel is deeply protective of H.W, but only for that H.W brings to the society, a serene and innocent face. When both know Eli Sunday saying the land of his father has oil everywhere, making an offer to Daniel to buy the property from his father. Eli is the local preacher and a healer 'self-proclaimed' wants the money from the sale of the property to finance his own church.The lives of both characters change completely when Daniel decides to buy all the land outside the property of the father of Eli and tries to acquire all the land around, at bargain basement prices to be able to build an oil industry. And always with H.W at your side to strengthen the business.The setting of the film can be impressive, every minute that passes we see it bigger and bigger. And with it the ominous and annoying soundtrack that fits in every scene, leaving them more disturbing. When music raises the pitch dark, pessimistic and emotionally draining film, without ever taking center stage away from the performances, with characters that prove to be the soul of the story.Daniel Day Lewis proves to be one of the best actors of this generation, this film, in my opinion, gives his best performance to date. Daniel Plainview (Lewis) can be cruel, sinister and pessimistic at every passing second, but at the same time can show a little ray of goodness in his evil look; Paul Dano in a fantastic and disturbing performance, Eli Sunday (Dano) is the Movie's religion, amidst all the disturbance and sinister he is the sort of God to want to expel the devil, the devil being Daniel, out of paradise. But throughout the film it all fits.The film is a character study of a man who usually do not want to know and you will not be able to forget after all is said and done. After watching it you will not want to reveal it soon, but it will be for all the right reasons, Paul Thomas does all this perturbation on purpose. 'There Will be Blood' is a powerful and emotionally draining experience, the experience of one of the best MASTERPIECES ever made!",10,2,3,16 April 2013
Jaws," Steven Spielberg first MASTERPIECE!
","What was the cinema before this film? A sublime art that attracts attention of critics that could be rather positive or negative, and that people would rarely see only as a hobby. And the rookie Steven Spielberg, who was known for only 2 films with good reviews but commercial flops, and television directing episodes of unknown TV-series, found a dropped script and made a landmark in cinematic history.The story takes place in the peaceful community from Amity Island, where a young girl is found dead on the beach, in what appears to have been a shark attack. The new town sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) decides to give the order to close all the beaches from the island, but Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) prohibits the order at the request of several merchants of the island, because the city's trades relies on summer tourism. But when the mysterious shark attacks become frequent, the sheriff hires a marine biologist from the Oceanographic Institute, Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to help him find and kill the mysterious killer shark. And for this hunt it joins the mysterious local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) offering his boat. But the small group barely know they will need a bigger boat.This movie had everything to go wrong. Costs increase in the middle of the production of 4 million to 9 million due to several flaws in filming with cameras being damaged and problems with the mechanical shark. The Company was willing to give up the movie, but the young Spielberg insisted he wanted to go through with the job. And who would have thought that what was the predictable failure eventually end up grossing over 400 million dollars, no film before had hit that mark at the box office (which would reasonably up to 10 or 20 million). This film was the 1st blockbuster of cinema history, way before 'Star Wars'.Pity that nowadays people just see this film as a mere classic and nothing more. Nothing to compare with today's movies, right?! WRONG! This masterpiece (yes, masterpiece), has qualities of any great movie. 'Jaws' not only marked just for have been the No. 1 blockbuster in film history, but its history also left critics and audiences amazed. The story is not just about three men chasing a white shark, well, it is, but how it is constructed. The screenplay by Carl Gottlieb and Peter Benchley (who wrote the book on which the film was based) building realistic and relatable characters, no film had ever done that before, bringing human reality to the film. Getting to make a realistic narrative characters, and several hilarious moments, bringing the film an excellent entertainment.But even with laughter, the film brings terrifying moments when the hunt starts. And Spielberg delivers one of his best directing debuts provided with excellent chilling scenes to breathtaking action scenes. And that's why Spielberg proved to be so talented, managing to have a large variation in he direction, ranging from sublime scenes of dialogue to the terrifying scenes of shark attacks, and the chilling last 30 minutes of the film. It also thanks the classic and terrifying soundtrack of John Williams, who will live forever and frighten us by his 'dandan dandan dandandandandandandan' with the mysterious monster getting closer ever more.And also the performances are no bat at all, actually they are all superb. Almost the entire cast came from movies and unknown plays and even in the case of Robert Shaw as the magnificent and unforgettable Le Quint Dickey (which serves almost as a parody of Captain Ahab and his hunt for the white whale Moby » Dickey). This film also has also secured the fame of both Scheider and Dreyfuss entering in other films which would guarantee their first Oscar nominations and here they won their first fortunes.If you wonder why Spielberg is so well known and appreciated today, see this masterpiece. The master with this film not only mixed a loyal adaptation of a book with humor and horror, but redefined modern cinema forever. Thanks to this film, actors and directors today earn fortunes, people line up to see and be entertained with a movie, which gave us cinema of quality cinema. All thanks to a terrifying soundtrack from John Williams and Steven Spielberg, with 'Jaws', one of his first of many masterpieces.10/10",10,3,7,21 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally...George Lucas make's it right again!
","Finally George Lucas returned to make a decent Star War's movie. After the great original trilogy of Star Wars, George Lucas promised to make the sequel trilogy of it, but he gave up due to family problems. Years passed and Gerge Lucas promised to make a new Star Wars trilogy, only it was counting before the events of the original trilogy, telling the story of the best villain of all time ... Darth Vader. The fans were exited to this new trilogy, and finally in 2001, 'Phantom menace' came and it was awful, so much boring. And then the sequel 'Attack of the Clones' came in 2002 and and was a little better, but continued boring. And 2004 came, and with him Episode 3 - 'The Revenge of the Sith,' I, who was disappointed with the previous episodes, I was waiting for something boring again, actually I had an pleasant surprise waiting for me. The Revenge of the Sith hit me, and hit me good, this was the movie that George should have done from the beginning. He was very loyal to the original trilogy, to the fate of the characters and the events that led to the original trilogy, but also as Darth Vader himself. George gives a focus on character and what led her to become the greatest villain of cinema. He was good before, it was Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi with a good heart and intentions of justice, but he was denied that, he saw their beliefs being destroyed, I personally would have done the same as him, but not so exaggerated, because As said before, this situation led him to madness, turning into pure evil. Not only with him but with all characters get better, Obi Wan learns to be more mature when needed, Yoda is more Badass than ever, The Emperor was the best surprise for me, I hate him more than before. The film begins with that boringness of the previous ones, but it improves over increasingly. Staying with the ambiance of the original trilogy, with absolute tension and we are very concerned about the fate of the characters. And how George can put history, politics, and action sequences with this magnificent world is fantastic to see. With stunning scenery, a delightful soundtrack to listen, with an exciting ending, Episode 3 is one of the best Star Wars movie ever.",9,2,5,15 April 2013
Inception," Christopher Nolan = GENIUS
","Have you ever remembered of your dreams? Already controlled them? Built things and had everything you ever wanted by just dreaming? If not, 'Inception' will teach you how! 'Inception' can be the best work of Nolan since 'The Dark Knight'. Handing over a film that needs a lot of intellectual capacity to understand it and love it completely. But thanks to great writing of Nolan, it doesn't need to burn any brain cells. As I said, the construction of the film goes beyond the limit of fantastic.Everything in the film works at a fantastic pace, the story itself is made of a tremendous geniality. Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an 'extractor' who works in extracts memories and ideas from the minds of people while they sleep through their dreams. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), a murder that he didn't committed and still been haunted by the memory of Mal in his dreams. But Cobb gets a new job that can guarantee his returning back home with a clean record. A job offered by Saito (Ken Watanabe) a old target of one of Cobb's works (which ran pretty bad), which offers an almost impossible job to perform, instead of extracting Cobb will have to implement an idea in the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the economic rival of Saito. For that Cobb will have to join the best teams to help him get back home.The story seems confusing, but Nolan explores it with an amazing intelligence, presenting very intelligent and realistic arguments of how dreams work and how we can control them. And at the same time how they are connected with our mind, building the film by every minute that passes with amazing dialogs making it more fantastic. But not only intellectuality of Nolan that stands out in the film. His direction is nothing bad at all.Many compare 'Inception' to 'The Matrix' because of the action scenes and the intellectuality from start to finish but both movies have completely different ideas and especially the action scenes. While Matrix has bullet-time with Kung Fu moves, Inception gives superb action sequences, as they can be realistic and always be connected to the world of dreams. The direction of 'Inception' is without limits ranging from fantastic to dazzling, thanks also to the PERFECT visual effects that create entire worlds.In the film we also have one most breath-taking soundtracks that the master Hans-Zimmer once again delivers, fantastic and diversified songs that fit perfectly in every scene, and all of them really well connected with dreams.'Inception' is not only the best of Nolan, but also one of the most well made films ever created, thanks to superb performances (especially DiCaprio), a fantastic screenplay and stunning visual effects, 'Inception' is an intellectual journey and purely fun which brings us to the world of dreams. One of the best movies of this generation with no doubt.",10,2,5,31 May 2013

His wife and her lover show up dead in the next day and Andy is sentenced to life imprisonment in Shawshank institute where begins his great life story when he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and a strong friendship starts between this two during the long years of imprisonment. Andy manages to bring many benefits to the prison and the prisoners, but only later that Andy discovers that his arrest was all a 'misunderstanding.'The strongest points of the film is the screenplay of Darabont writing and detailing the film with greater mastery possible by putting us in the place of Andy and get us feeling the tightness and claustrophobia of prison. But at the same time with a very well-constructed dialog that narrates the film without blemish and without leaving any loose end, leaving the story and his final message in greater perfection. A story that teaches the value of friendship and strong at the same time of hope, one of the beautiful things in life and that we can never abandon it or forget it.Not only the story is absolutely amazing and without any flaws, but the performances of each of the cast stand out, Morgan Freeman being perfect as in all his roles. But who stands out is definitely Tim Robbins with a show of perfection while maintaining its character as it is, shy and who keeps to himself and does not try to be anything more than that.A film that is undoubtedly magnificent, a true masterpiece that should be watched over and over again to witness this spectacle emotionally breathtaking classic.",10,1,1,29 May 2013
Raging Bull," Robert DeNiro's best!
","After this film, still ongoing in doubt which film is the masterpiece by Martin Scorsese. Well, I do not know, but 'Raging Bull' is definitely one of them.The movie is not for everyone, because the story is very complex and unlike anything ever done, and a clean writing and direction that shape from start to finish! The story serves as a biography hasty, but goes deeper than that. The film tells the story of the career of the fighter Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) and the rise of his career, and while his life. To the poor living fighter with a nagging wife being sponsored by the youngest brother; his tremendous winning streak; to his fall into depression.The film follows, as I said before, like a biography but more exploits man. The rise in his life, and the consequences that it has brought to him. The steering black and white that Martin Scorsese uses is fantastic, giving those who watch the film to feel in place of Jake inside and outside the ring. Leaving it to those who attend feel the claustrophobia and fatigue that Jake faces during fights, and also during times of his family life.The entire cast is terrific, Cathy Moriarty (Vickie La Motta) formidable and charming; Joe Pesci (Joey) excellent as always, Robert De Niro ..... IT'S JUST SIMPLY PERFECT, embodies her character in the greatest possible perfection delivering his best performance till today! An amazing movie with a superb direction, performances beyond perfect, an amazing approach to life a character so relatable. A film that manages to be an exciting claustrophobic spectacle.",10,2,2,16 April 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The word 'EPIC CONCLUSION' on the trailers wasn't for nothing!
","Christopher Nolan, the man who brought the dark vigilante franchise back to business with the tremendous box office and critical success that was 'The Dark Knight' and its predecessor 'Batman Begins,' Nolan decides to complete his trilogy of Batman in great style. And all I have to say is: the word EPIC in the trailers and posters were not been for nothing! 'Rises' begins, where all fans predicted (and what the synopsis told), eight years after the terrible events of 'The Dark Knight'. We found a Gotham in 'peace' and without organized crime. The great struggle for peace that the vigilante Batman (Christian Bale) and Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) fought for finally had their results, but nothing is achieved without sacrifice. For Gordon is the tremendous embarrassment at having to hide a lie for the greater good, while Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale too, who knew?) lost his soul living in exile of the world just relying on his mentor and best friend Alfred (Michael Caine). But everything changes when the mysterious terrorist known as Bane (Tom Hardy) begins terrorizing Gotham forcing Bruce to have to regain their strength and wear the mask and cape once more and fight for justice, but Bane is not a villain to be underestimated.Many complain of 'Rises' by not having the same style as its predecessor, but neither should. Nolan in his trilogy has different rhythms and themes: in 'Begins' had the story of a man wanting to do justice somehow becoming more than a hero; in 'The Dark Knight' had a frenetic pace of a thriller full of twists. In 'Rises', we can really say that it doesn't arrive at the feet of his predecessor, but Nolan presents us with a spectacle of emotion.The film can be divided in three acts (yes, just like a play). At first we have an dramatic and sad environment, as if we were in the place of Bruce and his broken and suffered world by the consequences of the past, filling the audience with memorable moments of dialog between the characters we learned to love over the trilogy, and even new characters including the sexy Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) and the young cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt.) In the second act we have a great climax full of suspense, where the power of Bane proves to be very powerful and also the strength of the lies of the past. And is also in this act that lays the major problem of the film, the beginning and the end of the second act are superb but one point to another it seems that there is a tremendous hurry suffering with an annoying lake of narrative just to jump to the 3rd act of the film where all the dramatic climax and suspense mingle with the final epic and the word 'rise' attacking strong in our hearts.But leaving the narrative aside because with Nolan it had always been superb (except for the expediting 2nd act), but in technical levels the film is 'PERFECT'. Nolan gives a use of IMAX as a true master, giving the film a visual gigantic and epic, since scenes of terrorist attacks and huge car chases to moments of dramatic dialogs between the characters. The visuals effects once again stunning and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer EXCELLENT as always.'The Dark Knight Rises' doesn't arrive at the feet of his predecessor, but gives us a real emotional and epic spectacle that no other superhero movie has ever showed. Thanks to a stunning direction and flawless script, with superb performances from Christian Bale as both Wayne and Batman (best performance of this trilogy); Anne Hathaway sexy and intelligent a real Catwoman; one unrecognizable Tom Hardy as the gross and evil genius Bane , and we still have Michael Caine and Gary Oldman stunning as always and also Joseph Gordon Levit which proved to be an important piece in the whole saga. All this makes 'Rises' a truly epic end to one of the best trilogies ever made, making it unforgettable and legendary.9/10",9,2,6,27 August 2013

","When I heard about this movie, I did not get many details, I've just heard that it was really wonderful, a true masterpiece. And then I thought the movie was some kind of a biography or a beautiful heartwarming story ... after seeing it I can say that is a little bit of everything.In the movie we have the story of Amélie (Audrey Tautou). Since she was a kid, she always liked to help people around her, making them happy. Not doing great things or giving money, but with little things. For example: She helps her father, making him believe that his garden gnome is on a trip around the world; it helps a lonely neighbor just by visiting it; it helps a stranger returning something from your childhood that she found in her house; and so on. On the way, she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz), who spends his time collecting photos of automatic photo booths in railway station.

And by the way, the dream of Amélie is to be remembered for many years through their deeds, and her inspiration is Lady Di. In this world of Paris, Amélie is almost perfect inhabitant. She has one of the faces seem to smile all the time. Managing to convey happiness not only for his achievements, but also by her dear eyes.The film looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts of the life of Amélie, her youth, for example, seem almost strangely happy. Jean-Pierre Jeunet (director-writer) can do this in a wonderful way. Leaving us stuck to the life of Amélie, with a sweet and fantastic performance of Audrey Tautou.'Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain' is one of the most wonderful movies ever made, with a character, story, direction and writing just fantastic, leaving the film totally unforgettable.",9,1,4,27 April 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Part 3 of the longest movie ever made!
","The longest movie ever made, so long that the director had to divide it in three parts, and that's why people call a trilogy. 10 hours of a phenomenal spectacle that will leave anyone with tears and a heavy heart after the magnificent end.In 'The Fellowship of the Ring' we start with the journey of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) towards to Mordor, lair of the dark lord Sauron. And we see the great training and union of the Fellowship of the ring, an alliance of all the living beings of Middle-earth on a mission to destroy the 'One Ring' and thus save the world from the darkness.In 'Two Towers' we have the beginning of the Great War between humans and orcs, with the army of Saruman (Christopher Lee) marching against the kingdom of Rohan. And Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) along with the elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and the dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) joining in the battle. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are getting closer every day to the lair of Sauron, now having the help of the strange creature Gollum / Smeagol (Andy Serkis) who wants by all means his 'precious'.And finally in 'The Return of the King' we have the spectacular ending to the trilogy / film. Since the beginning of the film we felt the feeling that everything is coming to an end. Frodo and Sam finally reached Mordor and try to find a way to infiltrate into the enemy territory and Gollum / Smeagol plans to take the ring from Frodo, who becomes increasingly heavy. And on the other side we have the beginning of the great battle that we expected since the first movie, the showdown between humans and orcs in the battle that will determine the fate of the world with all the characters we have learned to love here together in this fight to the uncertain ending.Peter Jackson (director-writer) brought to life the masterpiece of books, 'Lord of the Rings' by the genius JRR Tolkien. This can be the best adaptation of a book to film ever made, if the book is already a masterpiece in the world of books, Jackson made a masterpiece of cinema. The gigantic story that was told in six books, in film it was told in one film. A film of more than 10 hours, it had to be divided into three parts forming the best trilogy already made. I say it's just a movie because all three movies work as one, from the beginning to the end we realize that.Since the first film (or first part) we have the magic of Tolkien's working here, along with Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens (writers) have recreated and remained faithful to Tolkien's work and the film managed to raise the themes of friendship, courage and while it has always had religious references in the book and the film manages to convey everything in the greatest perfection.Not only the writing is phenomenal, but the visual effects are stunning giving a gigantic scale the movie, so well detailed visual effects that make everything look so realistic. And the effects are not only stunning but also that the soundtrack that is simply magnificent.A trilogy that works as a single film that is a true masterpiece. A landmark in film history thanks to excellent writing and direction of Jackson and fantastic performances from all the cast, 'The Lord of the Rings' is the epic fantasy stunning in every detail and be loved by all.10/10",10,1,2,7 October 2013
Munich," Steven Spielberg still AWESOME, so shut up if you don't agree!
","After the entry of the 21st century, Steven Spielberg began to be criticized by the new generation. A lot of them saying that he was losing his edge, that he longer make good movies like he used to, that he is getting lost on making entertaining movies such as 'AI', 'Catch me if you can', 'The Terminal,' 'Minority Report' and 'War of the Worlds '(which are nothing bad at all, all of them just great movies). But 'Munich' served almost like a letter in response to those critics telling them to shut up forever.'Munich' shows (almost perfect) the truthful events of the terrorist attack by the terrorist group called 'Black September', which took place on September 5 in the Summer Olympic Games in 1972 in Munich (dah). In this attack, 11 Israeli athletes were taken hostage by the terrorist group, and were later brutally murdered when the terrorists were caught in a shootout with the German police. The story follows a group of agents of 'Mossad' led by Avner (Eric Bana) who are ordered to hunt down and kill the leaders of the group 'Black September' and the men who planned the attack. All of them fled and spread throughout Europe.The film is able to demonstrate in a very realistic and at the same time loyal to the actual events of the fateful day. The partnership of Tony Kushner and Eric Roth on the screenplay works superbly giving a simple writing while packed with suspense leaving the man-hunt behind the responsible for the attack more tense leaving us more intrigued wondering how it will end, and together with the direction Spielberg all works fantastically.But while the film works as a drama demonstrating the true story of the attack and also as a thriller full of suspense showing the hunt for those responsible, but at the same time functions as a symbolic and human exploration of religious conflicts involved in the film. The screenplay delivers several moments of dialog between the characters questioning the cause of these conflicts and the cause of them and the reason for so many deaths. And also dialogs about the relationship and family honor involved in the midst of those religious conflicts, most of them involved with the character of Avner that while is hunting the terrorist leaders, he has a pregnant wife at home to worry about and a father with a great military career. While giving a somber and also reflective tone throughout the film.The cast was also highlighted in an excellent way, all superb in their characters since Daniel Craig as the angry and sarcastic agent Steve to Geoffrey Rush as Ephraim the head of the 'Mossad', all great but who stands out and demonstrates a real talent is Eric Bana gives a astonishing performance (even the weird accent can give).'Munich' only shows that Spielberg still manages to make films with a bleak vision and matures upon a true story. And along with Eric and Tony writing manages to bring to the public tense and reflective moments about the religious conflicts and the family values and religious influences involved, delivering a superbly well written screenplay and alongside with a fantastic direction and excellent performances, makes 'Munich' one of the most ambitious and magnificent films that Spielberg brought to the world.",10,2,3,23 June 2013
The Matrix," What is the Matrix? How you define Matrix?
","When someone hears the word 'Matrix', it already thinks on a man dodging bullets in slow time, little he knows that 'The Matrix' is so much deeper than that.'The Matrix' is the classic action - sci-fi that forever changed the cinematic action scenes, but the film is not only fantastic action scenes, as I said, is much deeper than that.The story begins with Neo (Keanu Reeves), who lives two lives simultaneously; in one he is Thomas Anderson, an important secretary in one of the most important computer companies in the world; in the other he is Neo, a night-hacker that sells all kinds of programs and computer viruses and tries to discover the meaning of the 'Matrix'. One day he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) who claims to have all the answers he needs and show Neo the way to get to know the Matrix. After a problem with the police, Neo decides to accept the help of Trinity who introduces him to Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) a wanted terrorist that shows to be an very polite and smart man and he know something that Neo doesn't. Morpheus offers Neo a chance to know what the Matrix is. Neo accepts the offer and discovers that not only what is the Matrix but also discovers that our whole world is nothing but a lie.The Wachowski brothers (directors-writers) can raise the film several philosophical theories about what is real and how the human mind works, and how we can create and control what is not real. But along with the philosophy, the Wachowskis have created action scenes that changed cinema forever. But all the frenetic action ranging that goes from Kung Fu moves in slow motion and the incredible bullet-time, and of course the classic scene of dodging bullets in slow motion, all of them are part of the whole philosophy that builds the Matrix.Writing and fantastic direction had to be accompanied by a formidable cast that is not what is missing in this movie. Keanu Reeves is superb and becomes the 'chosen one'; the fantastic Laurence Fishburne as the unforgettable Morpheus; and one of the greatest villains that cinema ever had it's Hugo Weaving as the cruel Agent Smith.A classic action and sci-fi that will be forever remembered, thanks to a fantastic writing and breathtaking action scenes make's 'The Matrix' a true masterpiece.",10,0,0,31 May 2013
Looper," 'This time travel crap, just fries your brain like an egg'. Rian Johnson really make a point with this phrase!
","For how long did the world had a good science-fiction film? Well, Nolan's 'Inception' is a masterpiece and technically speaking it is a sci-fi. Then in 2012 Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' came and it was despised by the public. But it was never easy to make a good sci-fi film, because it always approached over the years many different tones and genres ('Alien'-Horror, 'Star Wars'-Fantasy, 'Blade Runner'-Action and Philosophy). And then Rian Johnson, director-screenwriter from the school thriller 'Brick' and the 'comedy' 'The Bloom Brothers', with 'Looper' not only made the best sci-fi of 2012 but also one of the best of its kind.'Looper' is located at the future in 2044 where time travel has not been invented. But it will be in the year of 2074 and will start to be used by the most dangerous criminal minds in the world. Where when they want to get rid of a rival or someone, they send that person back in time where will be eliminated by assassins called 'Loopers' which from each death they will be rewarded with silver or gold, because technically speaking the death never happened. One of these Loopers is called Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young selfish that drug-acted that have fun all night after another job well done. One day when he is about to close another job, he discovers that his new target it is his older-self (Bruce Willis). When Joe is about to 'Kill-himself' the Old Joe manages to escape, and if any Looper let his target escape he also will be hunted down and killed. Now Joe has to find his older self and kill him avoiding his own death. But Joe barely knows the dark secrets that his older self from the future brings.What Rian Johnson made so special in Looper? Mainly because while 'Looper' can be quite original and unique. Johnson builds a credible and even possible future with poverty and corruption reigning (and also most of the population still use cars and only some use flying motorbikes). Also managing to join several clichés of time travel films from 'The Terminator' to '12 Monkeys'. That is, a possible frightening and terrifying future with a big twist in the film.Not just clichés of time travel that Rian Johnson brings to Looper, but as I said before, science-fiction has always had many different genres and Rian Johnson knows that. Putting in the movie good old fashioned action (bloody violent and awesome as hell), but also dramatic moments when Joe meets Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon). And also elements of Western with the Loopers (bounty-killers using revolvers and weird-awesome shotguns). Along with dark and violent moments, especially when Old Joe starts to show his true motives.All this comes with a superb screenplay written by Johnson himself. The writing seems a mixture of Michael Mann with Tarantino and Joss Whedon. This means, long but never get boring well-paced dialogs, raising in them several different topics related to the history and making all characters relevant in the story. Speaking of characters, all of them are very well built and are part of the great genius that Johnson put in the movie. Mainly because there is no good vs. evil here, Joe shows to be really selfish in various situations, and the Old Joe shows several reasons for what he is doing.But what they all have in common is fantastic performances: since Emily Blunt (great) to Paul Dano (which unfortunately barely appears in the film); Bruce Willis finally after a time with horrible action movies (except for 'Red') showing that he can be a excellent actor; Levitt.....well I don't even know if that's Joseph Gordon – Levitt. Or Rian Johnson has a time machine and he went in the past and asked Bruce Willis in his 30s to act in the film, or that is an excellent blend of makeup and contact lenses or a MAGNIFICENT performance from Levitt.'Looper' is succeeds not only for its great originality, but also by the use of various genres and tones that science fiction films always approached by mixing together clichés of previous films. All thanks to a superb script, great direction and excellent cast, with a great genius since the beginning to the 'mind blowing' end, 'Looper' it was not only one of the best films of 2012 but it can be one of the best sci - fi movies ever made.10/10",10,0,4,16 April 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The beginning of a new era!
","Before the genius George Lucas was about to go help Spielberg make the majestic ' Raiders', he decided to do something, something that many were surprised when it was announced and didn't take a lot of faith on, which after his release was an absolute success both at the box office and critical, and today the masterpiece of Lucas is a classic that will live forever in the history of cinema! 'Star Wars' (not Star Wars IV A New Hope, please), begins with the yellow title suddenly appearing on the screen with an amazing soundtrack from the master John Williams giving us a resume of the history we are about to watch. It all starts with a small spaceship full of rebel soldiers start being invaded by imperial troops led by the sinister and cruel lord Darth Vader (David Prowse). Suddenly the film transports us directly to another side of the galaxy where we have the story of the young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a simple machine repairman teenager who lives with his uncles. A day after his uncle buy two servant robots, R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), which inadvertently bring Luke the chance to realize his dreams of becoming a rebel and fight against the tyrant of the empire, a mission that will take him to the ends of the galaxy and will bring new friends but at the same time extreme dangers.From the beginning, 'Star Wars' revolutionized cinema forever, especially the genre of sci - fi that at the time was just 'Star Trek' with great success. Lucas of course certain elements form 'Trek', since the crew of a spaceship with name style and friendship among the crew, but everything else was a tremendous attack of originality. Unlike 'Star Trek' Lucas took the story and the great adventure with a lighter and fantasy tone, not childish but humorous, fun and even a certain religious point when the Jedi Obi - Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) appears in Luke's life with secrets of him and Luke's father past.And just like 'Star Trek', Lucas gave his masterpiece unforgettable characters, of course: Luke, R2, C-3PO, Obi-Wan. But also the unforgettable Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the bounty hunter from space who ALWAYS shoots first and asks questions later, giving the film a great humorous touch and a lot of fun (never one character caused such influences as Han Solo did), and even Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) no royal woman before her in a film had never taken up arms showing she knew very well how to take care of herself. Not only the good guys who stand out perfectly in the story, but also the great and unforgettable antagonist ever put to film, Darth Vader, no villain was so cruel and yet so adored by fans.Characters and stories fitting perfectly, but the adventure to be full completed it needed the huge Galactic scenario, which is not lacking in this film. I think Lucas should have thanked Kubrick about '2001' because if it were not for this film, visual effects would never be the same. And thanks to that Lucas gave the film with beautiful scenery and a vast galaxies and an unforgettable and thrilling final battle.The classic that redefined cinema forever with a story well-crafted and told, full of suspense, humor and adventure thanks to its unforgettable characters and stunning visual effects , the legendary George Lucas gave the world a film with tremendous quality and early one of the best trilogies ever made.10/10",10,2,3,22 September 2013
50_50," Seth Rogen on a drama
","How many drama movies about cancer treatment, with suffering performances and a true story of overcoming have been made and even became tiresome way? Well, the young director Jonathan Levine and Will Reiser (screenplay) found a formidable new vision of it all.The film tells the story of Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young man of twenty-seven years working for a radio company in Seattle. He is informed that he has a rare form of cancer called 'Neurofibrosarcoma', and is told he only has a 50% chance to live with him. Frustrated, but moving day to day with a seemingly calm, with the help of his friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), Adam continues his long journey of recovery. Only to be bothered by his irritating, selfish girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard). But with the help of the, half embarrassed but very helpful, psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick). Adam then proceeds to deal with their illness and can remain calm during most part of the film.There are so many forms of cancer, rare and common, harmless and that their chances of getting it are very high. Start is random, but dealing with it is even more difficult. While '50/50' is a moving, and sometimes it is emotion-test and tearful, he still has a strong comic relief thanks to Seth Rogen, and several occasions that Adam and Kyle meddle.The film is a drama, that works as a comedy very well written. Some may find this a defect, but rather a quality. Adam throughout the film faces its situation near death in a lively manner. It's as if the film were telling us, 'if it is your last minutes, let then be smiling!'.The cast is terrific, even comic, Seth manages to have an interesting dramatic performance; Anna Kendrick formidable as ever; Angelica Houston and Serge Houde as Adam's parents with great performances; but who shines above everyone is Joseph Levitt with a fantastic performance, proving to be an very promising actor.Thanks to a wonderful third act, in terms of direction and screenplay that never fail or work against the film at any time, the public has an emotional breakdown all of the characters and the story itself and fantastic to witness.",8,15,17,27 April 2013
300," Badass!!!
","300 is Zack Snyder's second Masterpice (the first is definitely Watchmen). He, Kurt Johnstad Michael Gordon carry the famous graphic novel of Frank Miller in the greatest perfection, and how Snyder directs is impressive. Such as the comic, 300 mixes a bit of history, action, sex and excellent characters. Transporting it from comic to screen could only have been the author himself, but that's where Snyder proves that even knows how to write screenplays (with help, of course) and it was with this film that Snyder was so recognized. The story itself I found very good, portrays the war of Thermopylae in a way so hardcore-badass. I can say that everything in the movie is BADASS, the screenplay is fantastic and gave us one of the most striking phrases of all time, 'THIS IS SPARTA!'. Speaking of which, the Spartans in the film are all badasses, the mens, the womens, even the kids. The scenes and scenery are fantastic, everything takes place behind a green screen, but are so AWESOME. The soundtrack is Badass, fits in every scene, some are dramatic way, but others are for action. The cast, also is badass, Gerard Butler give a great (and badass) performance as King Leonidas; Michael Fassbender is also a total hardcore badass; Rodrigo Santoro also gives a great performance as King Xerxes, pity that was not his real voice we hear in the film. Two words defines '300' to me, HARDCORE-BADASS!",8,0,4,15 April 2013
Jackie Brown," The Best of Tarantino? Nah! Super fun? Damm straight!
","It's the best of Tarantino? No it is not! It's extremely fun? A LOT! Jackie Brown is the 3rd feature film from the master Quentin Tarantino, and can once again prove their writing skills and originality, and an unforgettable cast. The story looks a bit like Pulp Fiction, Jackie (Pam Grier) is a black stewardess 40 years, with life unstable financial environment, at least in this work. Because secretly she's a drug dealer and exchange money, she works for the 'famous' arm's dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), the most dangerous and ruthless leader of the crime (and extremely entertaining) anyone can know. On a normal day of traffic, Jackie is caught by two DEA agents Ray (Michael Keaton) and Mark (Michael Bowen), before being arrested both agents offer Jackie the chance to have all his clean criminal record in helping arrest Ordell . Between being perpetually stuck or open your mouth and be killed by Ordell, Jackie sees only a chance to enjoy this little game of intrigue. The entire movie, like any Tarantino movie, is filled with intriguing dialogs, what is most striking is that the film manages to be extremely fun just getting the dialog, and the plot twists than any movie Tarantino has. But this was the first film I see that Tarantino takes mild violence. It is violent? It is, but is not that awesome bloodbath of the other Tarantino's films. The cast is also formidable, Samuel L. Jackson BADASS as always; Pam Grier excellent as Robert Forster; Robert De Niro does not give his best performance, but he still shine as the temperamental junkie Louis Gara. Not the best of Tarantino, but it is really entertaining from start to finish, keeping the good spirit of the films of the great Master.",9,0,2,15 April 2013
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," BEST SEQUEL EVER MADE (before The Dark Knight)
","After the huge success of 'Star Wars' both critical and in the box office, giving birth to a new era cinema. George Lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, many fans were afraid (even with Lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level.'Empire' begins shortly after the huge events of its predecessor with the entire rebel army after destroying the ' Death Star', fleeing through galaxy with the powerful imperial fleet right behind them with ruthless Darth Vader (David Prowse) in command. And with the rebels we see Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his 'inseparable' friends: the brave and cocky (and Badass) Han Solo (Harrison Ford); the brave and intelligent Leia (Carrie Fisher); the.....Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). But their lives begin to suffer a great risk when the Empire finds the rebel position in the ice world of Hoth, where a huge battle starts forcing the rebels to retreat. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C - 3PO manage to escape in the Millennium Falcon, but end up being captured later by Darth Vader thanks to a betrayal of Han's friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke and R2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), Luke is advised to go to the Dagobah system and meet the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz) which will help Luke know and control the 'strength', which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends.At the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable. No one at the time expected to see a major change in direction that the director and writers, hell, even the Lucas led to film and its history, and today the film is considered not only the best Star Wars ever made, but also one of the best sequel of a saga in the cinema.If Lucas in the 1st film had already revolutionized the modern cinema, so here he and his team raised barriers never explored. While the 1st movie had the great adventure of Luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. In this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to Han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters. And also thanks to the writers who deliver an amazing and beautiful narrative to the characters since small to big dialogues between the characters showing their human side, and also further exploring the 'Jedi' topic that it wasn't been well explored in the 1st movie. But also the other side where the film is taken is into a very dark twist that began when dark secrets from the past begin to appear.A flawless script and characters very well evolved, but also at the technical aspects the film rises completely. From the incredible visual effects with a beautiful visual direction from Kershner. And also the new and memorable soundtrack from John Williams 'The Imperial March', you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (I know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?! Not only the best 'Star Wars' or the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies ever made will be marked forever in the history of cinema. All thanks to a flawless script, beautiful direction, strong performances (especially Mark Hamill with an incredible evolution of acting) and the biggest twist that cinema ever had makes 'Empire Strikes Back' an eternal masterpiece! 10/10",10,0,0,23 September 2013
Sin City," One of the best comic adaptations ever. Thank you Robert....and Miller....and Tarantino!
","Robert Rodriguez just Brought to life the comic book, with some steroids. Without wishing to belittle Robert Rodriguez, but this time he had help from his dear friend Quentin Tarantino and Frank Miller screenplay. 'Sin City' is a comic book by Frank Miller made ​​in 1991, with 6 editions, which tells the story of several characters in this dangerous city at the same time, along with the consequences of their choices and a violent history and romance. To bring this to life course had to seek help from the author himself to develop the story, and ask for help to Tarantino to add a delicious violence without exaggeration. We have the story based on the first edition of Sin City, 'The Hard Goodbye' where we see the story of a cop (Bruce Willis) trying to prove his innocence in a crime of rape against a little girl who did not commit. And who ends up falling in love with her ​​years later, on the other hand we see the story of an ex-cop (Clive Owen) trying to help his mistress against the drunk boyfriend, which ends up turning into a chase against time and a gang war. On the other side we see a 'good mercenary' (Dolph Lundgrenque) who investigates the death of his girlfriend, killed during the night while they made love. Fantastic stories that intersect throughout the film, with an excellent cast with fun characters and exciting that will hold up from start to finish. Not without mentioning that is super fainthfull to the comic (well daahh, is the author himself who wroted the movie). Robert Rodriguez did here a Masterpiece ... with a little help.",8,0,1,15 April 2013
Gangs of New York," History class never had been so much cool!
","Gangs of New York, is unlike anything I've ever seen. It is a masterpiece of Scorsece. but can be a show of pure entertainment, with excellent performances. It is a film that is half history, half action, half drama, half crime. The story, as the title says, is about the first gang that existed in New York City before and during the American Civil War, which were mostly composed of Irish, Chinese, German, etc ... The main character is Amsterdam Vallon, the son of one of the most powerful leaders of the gangs of New York (the dead-rabbits), who was killed during a clash against another gang, a gang American (The Patriots), he returns to New York years later seeking revenge against Bill the Butcher, the leader of the Patriots who killed his father. Of course you already think he's back, joins the group from his father, there is a confrontation and a nice happy ending ... Well, as I said before, it's all very different from what I've seen. The film goes deeper than the main story itself, explores the city of new york 'before it becomes a city.' The whole movie has as stage, the neighborhood of five points (what is now Paradise Square). Hence the film covers much of the history of the city, New York before and during the civil war was controlled by gangs while politicians were concerned only with the votes of election, with the help some gangs. The gang that controls the five points controlled the entire city (mainly because the five points gave access to all city streets). The story serves as a wick for the fire of the film. The film even manages to be epic at this point, as can also be disturbing in some parts, while fun to watch, no one notices the length of time it will fly. One point that I should mention is the soundtrack that is very diverse, some are even disturbing, others funny, others extremely epic. The soundtrack of the film's ending is a mixture of all that we hear the during movie. The film is very well made and designed, the cast is fantastic, Daniel Day Lewis dominates with one of his best performances, and of course we have Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz as always excellent. An epic film that I found while a good and entertaining history lesson at the same time we had fun and thrill. Congratulations Martin Scorsece!",9,0,0,15 April 2013
Braveheart," FREDOOM!!!!! This world never meant so much to me after this masterpiece.
","Mel Gibson in 'Braveheart' not only received the deserved appreciation towards his direction (that he didn't received in 'The Man Without Face') but also as an actor and managed to make one of the most beautiful and majestic epics ever made! 'Braveheart' as I mentioned before is a majestic epic in so many details to be appointed, but all have one similarity, they were all made by the hands of Mel Gibson in a magnificent way.The story is based on the great Scottish hero William Wallace (Mel Gibson), which after the death of his father and brother as a child and later the dead of love of his life Murron (Catherine McCormack), all by the hands of the British that at the time nurtured a cruel power in Scottish lands, at least until the great revolution that Wallace began not only in the name of revenge but for the beloved freedom for all the Scottish people.Randall Wallace (script) manages to maintain the film in a good fit to historical characters and events that really existed. But Gibson's hands were everywhere, the film not only serves as a biography of the character and the human hero that Wallace was but thanks to the influence of Gibson the film manages to bring out a powerful message of freedom and what it means to be free. We see it from several good dialogs between the characters throughout the film and also the powerful speech that Wallace gives before the battle of 'Stirling' (that wasn't actually very historically accurate but was Awesome as hell).Not only in the script that Gibson put his hands and gave a beautiful message of freedom but also its magnificent direction that leaves all simply superb. His camera movements that show beautiful Scottish landscapes and scenes filmed beautifully leaving the film purely epic.Not only landscapes and scenes that its direction stands out but mainly in the excellent battle scenes. Mel Gibson can leave all the battle scenes made with a great realistic feel without overrating it, by that I mean that when the battle starts and the armies collide we really feel that we are watching true humans smashing each other.'Braveheart' not only manages to be the masterpiece of Mel Gibson in both direction and acting (PERFECT), but happens to be one of the most beautiful epics ever made. With a superb realistic feel without exaggeration and a beautiful message of freedom through a good writing and with a beautiful cast with terrific characters and a memorable soundtrack, 'Braveheart' is far from perfect, but it is a magnificent epic to be remembered.",10,3,5,16 July 2013
Gladiator," Best Roman-Empire movie since Ben-Hur and Spartacus! (Extend edition review-the true Ridley Scott masterpiece
","Who would knew that the director of 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' and 'Thelma & Louise', Ridley Scott. Would make one day a amazing Roman epic since 'Ben-Hur' and 'Spartacus'. And speaking of the extended edition (only available on Blue-ray) could not only overcome in several details the original, but also be another masterpiece of Ridley Scott's career.The film tells the story of the Roman general, the Spanish Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe). Maximus is on a military campaign in the barbaric Germania, led by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), which has lasted over ten years. Aurelius sees in Maximus courage and humility, and the spirit of a true leader, as a proof the love and admiration that the Roman army has for Maximus. Aurelius and Maximus nurture a big friendship and a love of father and son, which led to Aurelius appoint Maximus to be the new leader of Rome after his death, instructing Maximus to make Rome a republic again. But Maximus hesitate just because he expects his military pantry and return to his family in Spain, but the respect he has for the Emperor is very large. Everything changes when the arrogant and envious son of Aurelius, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) kills his father and orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus manages to escape and return home, where he finds his wife and children crucified beside the door. Maximus is arrested and later sold to a gladiator trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed), which later becomes the best among them, and sees a path to revenge.You could say that 'Gladiator' is Ridley Scott's 'Braveheart'. As it is filmed in the same realistic and violent style, but (in my opinion) can be much more epic. The direction of Ridley Scott is a great help, along with a dazzling cinematography on each scene. Both in spectacular epic battles (inside and outside the visually stunning Coliseum) and the superb dialog scenes.A major problem with films like 'Spartacus' and 'Braveheart' was connecting the dialog with the characters, which sometimes it failed and couldn't maintain a line of fiction with true historical facts, often not loyal at all. But I think Scott knew that and hired the right screenwriter for the job, David Franzoni. The writer of 'Amistad' along with John Logan and William Nicholson, can build a superb narrative to the film from start to finish. Achieving at the same time creating a fiction story, and be extremely loyal to historical facts of the Roman Empire.This is mostly seen in the extended version of the film. Where we have many more dialogs between the characters never getting boring for a moment. And can demonstrate accurately the Roman political system, since the massive corruption and political rivalries within the senate and also the great imperial totalitarianism with the character of Commodus. And thanks to Scott, manages to have a good level of entertainment within the amazing story.But for all become more epic and exciting, Scott asked the best author of soundtracks of this generation Hans-Zimmer to participate in this epic. And delivers a soundtrack that ranges from the thrilling and exciting to dramatic and chilling (as always done ever since).And course, no one in the cast disappoints. Joaquin Phoenix didn't won the Oscar in this movie for two reasons: 1- F#ckin Critics (as always), 2- Benicio Del Toro superb performance in 'Traffic', 3- Blue-ray versions don't compete for the Oscars. But who shines of course is Russell Crowe, with the PERFECT performance that put him on the map.Not that the theatrical version is bad. But after watching the extended version, the original feels very incomplete. Because here it was shown the exuberant performances of all the cast; the superb direction of Ridley Scott giving spectacular and realistic epic battles; a fantastic script that while it is original, it can be historically accurate with a fantastic story of the general who became a slave, the slave that turned into a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an empire. It has a question in the film: 'Are you not entertained?' All I have to answer is 'Yes, I 'am'! 10/10",10,1,4,15 April 2013
Donnie Darko," Chills in the brain during the whole movie.
","The movie just grabs you from the beginning through the brain with a slow and dramatic soundtrack, which suddenly gets excited about Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) going down the hill by bike up at home, arriving at dinner time with the Darko's family, which ends in a discussion between Donnie and his sister Elizabeth (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is also his sister in real life, UOL). Soon afterwards we see that Donnie is a troubled young man, insults his parents and sisters, take drugs, have emotional problems. Suddenly the film gets a dark and somber tone with a dying voice calling by Donnie. Donnie wake up and goes outside and comes across a man dressing a rabbit costume saying to Donnie that the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes and 22 seconds.Soon after this Donnie's room is invaded by a turbine aircraft. Donnie suddenly wakes up in a golf course and get back home and see his room destroyed. After a few days he returns to school and the film features almost all the students and teachers of the school. At the moment we think that we are watching a teenager's scary movie. But over the somber tone doesn't leave the film with the dying voice of the rabbit-man named Frank, forcing Donnie to do certain crimes. Such crimes with several consequences for the lives of all and Donnie.I know, the story is very strange, as the film itself. But just pay attention in Richard Kelly (writer-director) to see the masterpiece that the movie is.As said before the film looks more like a teen movie (which it is), but Kelly manages to put in the story several ideas and theories (one of them is the sexual activity of the Smurfs). Mixing a lot of elements of sci-fi like time travel, and elements of drama and teen romance. And also as someone's fate can change with just a little one thing happen.Since the great direction and the formidable writing with great ideas, along with fabulous performances, and a final exciting. The masterpiece of Richard Kelly is creepy, hilarious, exciting and memorable.",9,1,4,12 May 2013
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," This is what I call Archeology!
","After two masterpieces (one very underrated), the dual Spielberg and George Lucas had achieved complete success, and didn't plan to stop there. Spielberg promised Lucas since the beginning that if would make one he would have to make a trilogy. And they didn't disappointed closing their trilogy with a golden key with another underrated masterpiece that captured millions of fans and made Dr. Indiana Jones legendary forever.Our great adventure this time begins when our unforgettable Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) in another of his adventures in the middle of the Pacific ocean being beat-up by pirates. When Dr. Jones takes control of the situation and steal a strange diary from the leader, manages to escape with a job well done (the first in the trilogy). Days later, we see our hero back to his college teaching job educating young mind. After the class, Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) chief and friend of Jones comes and warns him that Walter Donovan (Julian Glover), a relics collector want to offer him a new job. Shortly after the conversation with Walter, Jones discovers that the work involves the diary that he recovered from the pirates, showing the path to find the 'Holy Grail' (for those who do not know, the cup that Christ drank at the Last Supper). And Jones also finds out that this job had already been offered to his father Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), who disappeared in a museum in Venice. Now Jones embarks on a mission to find his father with Marcus and the path to the Holy Grail, which will take them from a museum in Venice to the Arabic deserts with danger following them closely.I think Lucas and Spielberg in this film have decided to put all that was good in the first and second film and joined perfectly (which the last movie of a trilogy usually does). Proof of this is the return of Marcus making him a very important character in the adventure, and later the return of Sallah (John Rhys - Davies) who doesn't have much relevance, but it is fun to see him again since the first film. But the main thing that Lucas and Spielberg gave the story was to humanize the character of Indiana Jones.They do this through the first sequence of the film where we see a younger Indiana Jones, where we discovered many secrets of his past and finally the origin of the cowboy hat and the whip, even his name (and finally the reference to the Western genre in a film Spielberg). And when his father Henry Jones appears, and perhaps the best thing of the film. Since the first meeting in the movie of the Joneses, we already see the type of relationship between them two. Henry is a born lover of artifacts and history, giving more attention to study than the son who has created some resentment to his father. But their relationship throughout the film not only evolves, but thanks to the actors, they have an exceptional chemistry, making us laugh and love them even more.All this also thanks to the screenwriter Jeffrey Boam. Since the first film Lucas and Spielberg always changed the writers. Lawrence Kasdan in the first (considered one of the best screenplays ever written) and the couple Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz in the second (underrated). But Jeffrey didn't disappoint, making almost equal to Lawrence in the first, giving moments of dialog in the film, none of them gets to be boring, always flowing along very well in the story, especially between the Jones duo. Also filling the movie with a laughing out loud humor (perhaps the most humorous of the trilogy) but never gets to be stupid, but works very well in all the situations and the relationship of father and son.Mention direction and performances this time is stupid. Since the 1st movie Spielberg never disappoint in their direction, and wouldn't be different this time giving spectacular (and hilarious) action scenes from start to finish. And Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones never disappointed, and would not be this time (perhaps his best performance as the unforgettable and badass teacher). This also involves Sean Cornery giving an unforgettable character with a superb performance, and he and Harrison giving an incredible chemistry in their characters.Maybe not the best of the trilogy, but it's a fans favorite, and not for nothing. From a superb script that gives humor and soul to their characters, a marvelous direction, excellent performances, the best chemistry ever put between two characters in a movie. Spielberg and Lucas finished their trilogy giving heart and soul to Indiana Jones, reminding us why we love him, and making this saga forever legendary! 10/10",10,2,4,27 September 2013
Goodfellas," 'As far as I can remember ... I always wanted to be a gangster,' that phrase started this masterpiece and followed to the end.
","'GoodFellas' is simply (after 'The GodFather') the best-mafia gangster film ever made, and this is very clear in this movie.The story begins with Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a young Irish living in the suburbs of New York with his family, and suddenly finds himself involved with the Italian Mafia, and after some work and be arrested for the first time, he is finally integrated into the mob-family. Years pass and the life of Henry is now on the mob-business, a little work there, a robbery there, always with their best friends and partners James (Robert De Niro) and Tommy (Joe Pesci).As the story progresses, Martin Scorsese and Nicholas Pileggi (screenplay) explore the world mobster in an impressive way. It's almost watching a lesson in how to be a professional criminal. Always keeping a realistic pace, and that little black humor that always Scorsese uses in his films, achieving the film both interesting and pure entertainment.The entire cast does an excellent job, Robert De Niro despite not appear much, manages to be great; Ray Liotta is also excellent, but who gives a fantastic performance throughout the film is undoubtedly Joe Pesci.From beginning to end we see the Mafia as never before, while maintaining an impressive pace of entertainment, very well written and directed, 'GoodFellas' is surely one of the best works of Scorsese to be remembered.",10,0,0,16 April 2013
Jurassic Park," It took people being eaten and shattered along with the direction of Spielberg that made me remember why I always liked Dinosaurs.
","Another great classic that the master Spielberg gave to the world. Do you ever wonder why dinosaurs are very famous? Thanks to 'Jurassic Park' the 'Discovery Channel' almost was not necessary.Well, first let's talk about the story. The film is based on the book by Michael Crichton (who also wrote the movie's screenplay along with David Koepp). The film (which is quite different from the book) tells the story of a theme park where the main attraction is.... dinosaurs. The park, which has not yet opened to the public, is directed by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) wanting to do a demonstration of the park, he invites the world's best paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his wife Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and the scientist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), which looks more like a rock star. The three characters and the two grandchildren of John, Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards) begin the tour through the magical park, until the power source has problem taking all security systems to failure. And with that, the huge and small carnivorous creatures are released and begin the small massacre.The movie looks cute at the beginning, a little adventure on a magical island. Soon after the heroes arrive they primarily discover how the creatures that disappeared over 1 billion years ago are alive and in perfect condition. Then, moments of scientific dialogs start to explain everything. And if you think about it, it is all possible, that is where the writing of Michael stands out perfectly.Soon after the dinosaurs get loose, starts a pursuit of pure suspense that only ends way latter. When a poor character is eaten by a T-Rex, the movie give's the climax that any of the characters can be eaten at any time and torn.Writing, story, characters, all superb. But the technical aspects are totally stunning. The dinosaurs are very realistic, and their loud roars even seem real.Another memorable classic. Characters, story, and even the dinosaurs are really unforgettable, a true masterpiece to be remembered forever.",10,1,1,8 May 2013
The Godfather," BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, period! (Here It is the review from Parts 1-2-3 together)
","Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word 'perfection'? Well, 'The Godfather' parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely 'perfect' in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the 'American Dream'; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes 'The Godfather', the strongest brand of cinema till today10/10",10,2,5,7 October 2013
