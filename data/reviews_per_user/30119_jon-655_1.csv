Walk the Line," awesome story and chemistry
","Having followed the careers of both J.Cash and J Carter, the chemistry on screen between Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon would have done the 2 stars proud. It's extremely difficult to emulate personalities at the best of times. However, in this case it works wonderfully and this is one movie not to miss. It deserves all the Oscar nominations it received. To cut a long story short, the magic between the 2 actors goes to show that you do not need big name stars to take the part. Ms Witherspoon's stature stands out in this case. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal is outstanding, giving you an eerie feeling that JC is right there. Can't wait to see this again.",10,0,0,3 February 2006
