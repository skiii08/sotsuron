Black Swan," Insult to a good movie
","I must admit I actually created account to write a comment about yet another failed Hollywood attempt to create a good movie.The intention to stay away from patterns was too dominant throughout the movie and at the end left a story line that has no basis in real life and puts audience in a catatonic state for most part of the movie.As I saw it, this movie is on the same level as 'How was I pretty in Tibet' from Brad Pitt, wasted money. Natalie Portman, way overrated actress, poorly creates an image of a real life ballerina like being a ballerina is not a job done by professionals but some disturbed and out-of-this-world yuppies. Full of misconceptions about life of a prime ballerina, it really reminded me of another watered down movie 'Piano'. Besides, no clue on where the background of the characters is, no basis for making a plot so they just decided to ignore it since there is no parallel. Practically, Athena's birth when Zeus give a birth from his head. As I have a problem in actually believing such stories and actually know how theater works I can only say that this piece is a total waste of one's time providing the viewer actually has a taste with some filmography as well as 9-5 background.Filmography is very good and director really has moments yet who ever saw 'Elephant' sees a parallel. More so, I could name several films where supposed 'originalyty' is clearly full of many films put together. Drama-like Avatar. All in all, this movie is nothing but a very expensive graduate work. Even more so, I am convinced that with this budget a graduate student would tame much more time in actually saying something than this piece of work.I give it a 5 as it is nothing special, Britney kissed Madonna so long ago it stopped being news for everyone else but Hollywood.",5,5,23,26 December 2010
