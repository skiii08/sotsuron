The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," I just like it
","I guess that most of the reviewers giving criticisms never read the book. Although this movie dropped a lot of stuffs in the book, at least it shows the most important parts of it. I can't think a better way to film the book. It contains a lot of thoughts and feelings which are very hard to present in a movie. But they have done their best. If you are looking for an action movie, just don't see this one. You can't blame the movie because there is no violence or actions in it, otherwise it is not twilight. I also like the soundtrack in this one, they adopted the original music from the first twilight movie, which is also my favourite in the series of twilight movies. Overall, I am glad the movie is going back to the romantic way and closer to the original book.",10,7,20,21 November 2011
