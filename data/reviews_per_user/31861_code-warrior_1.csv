Black Swan," one of the worst movies i've seen in the past year.
","Normally i'm able to enjoy almost every type / genre of movie as long as it has a good storyline, good actors or is an impressive image artwork.Every of these characteristics which would make a good movie were missing in this one.I was first not watching it, due to all the bad critics i had already read about it. But then some friend suggested it to me as actually being a good movie.But this movie was just one thing: terrible. It felt like some teenage-movie-author had an attempt to make a deep going story, and failed heavily on it.Neither the attempts to create some dramatical psychological impression by using some special effects on her becoming a 'swan' as in literally, nor the acting itself was reaching anything near to become a good movie.As some already said: the plot was foreseeable, the scary parts weren't scary, the acting failed, also the choice of actors possibly wasn't the best anyways.. and made it completely feel like some teenage-movie, the presentation of her internal struggles and insanity by becoming the swan were hilarious......the 2 minutes of lesbian teenager sex might have been sadly the only 'highlight' in this movie. And even this wasn't really appealing.And i'll better stop here as everything else i have to add would be kinda the same.Fazit: There is really nothing that would make me suggest this movie being even close to watchable to someone.",1,24,51,6 January 2011
