The Avengers," Overall Great
","Joss Wheldon's 'The Avengers' is a fusion of recent Marvel movies like Iron Man, Thor, The Hulk and Captain America. Whether or not you have seen the movies parts wont make sense unless you're a Marvel fanatic. It's an action, comedy, sci-fi movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat but laughing at the same time. If you're anything like me, the movie will irritate you throughout. Knowing that it's a bunch of movies mixed in, I began to question myself if some characters I didn't recognize are in other movies like the black guy with the eye patch or the girl spy that seemed a little to porn star and her partner. If you were comic book reader you would know they were Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Nick Fury. Loki is Thor's adopted brother who tries to take over the world and become the leader. I feel like Loki's thought that we have to much freedom is inaccurate. In America we are lucky but a lot of the world isn't as fortunate. Loki's idea to rule the world because of this is not thought through. The Avengers are sent out to stop him and his invading army. The production quality was successful. After watching the movie I was curious as to what was actually real in the movie and what was special affects. The distinction was seamless, unlike the production of Alien, which is what these aliens remind me of. I would recommend watching it at night because it is so dark at times it's almost impossible to see. On the other hand the acting in this movie was outstanding. When it comes to the plot, the creativity was good. The characters have the same personality as in their own movies but are mixed in with jointly in such a way that the characters play off each other. It involves examples of real life human emotions, rationality and faults but is done in a premature way. I feel like the conflicts between the team are silly and felt unreal. This movie has many clich√©s in it. For example, why does the epidemic always seem to happen in NYC? Why do our leaders feel the need to bomb every place that they can't deal with? Why do the characters always have to argue and then make up at the end? Why does the Hulk never talk until the end? In conclusion the Movie was an overall success. The production quality was amazing along with the acting. The movie was very entertaining and well done. Along with almost every movie there is something that everyone doesn't like.",8,0,3,15 November 2012
