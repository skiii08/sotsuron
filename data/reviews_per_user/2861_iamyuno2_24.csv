Moneyball," Really Fine Baseball Movie
","One of the better baseball movies, this has almost the feel of a documentary, with a realism as it shows how real events played out, resulting in a new modern strategic mindset in baseball.Jonah Hill steals the show here as the brilliant tactician and statistician who figures out how to put together a great team on the cheap. His performance raises the movie to a cut above. This is his movie, in my humble opinion.Bratt Pitt is OK, but familiarly one-dimensional as the man, Billy Beane, who had the guts to run with Peter Brand's revolutionary untested theory on how cash-poor teams like his Oakland A's could compete with the better funded teams. He almost phones in his performance, I feel (some may disagree), but he does enough to represent his character in a way that doesn't take away from the story.But the real star of this movie is the story. It's intriguing enough and well-told enough to make you want to watch the film to the very end to see if the theory worked.Those who are not into baseball might find this a hard film to watch, but baseball fans absolutely have to see it if just to see how these guys changed the face of baseball. Make no mistake - here you see the strategy that has revolutionized baseball (for the better).",8,0,2,4 January 2014
Skyfall," Best Daniel Craig Bond Film & Worth Watching
","I'm not a big fan of Daniel Craig as James Bond - although I am a big fan of his impressive acting work in other films. No fault of Craig's but I just feel he looks more like an adversary of Bond's than I imagine Bond should look. 'Simple as that. And I don't feel he has the personality I associate with Bond - the wit and humor are not there (but I believe that that is the fault of casting director and the writers, not Craig). I was loathe even to see this film because I feel the producers lost their way in Craig's first Bond flicks - turning the movies into shallow bang 'em up MTV-style videos in a harsh and overly stylistic way that made the style the star instead of the story (which I felt was lacking). But my wife wanted to see this and, in the final analysis, I felt it was a worthwhile movie. It grabs your attention and entertains.Here, there's a good story. It's well done and well acted. The special effects are kept in check and they don't over-dominate this movie as they had Craig's prior Bond movies.I still don't feel Craig was cast properly as Bond and I still don't feel the producers are getting the Bond movie feel right. But I could watch and enjoy this film - which is more than I could say for Craig's earlier efforts as Bond.Seems as if the Bond producers are overly concerned about appealing to a younger audience while paying all too little attention to staying true to their subject.",8,1,6,4 January 2014
Casablanca," The Best of the Best
","I never get tired of this film - no matter how many times I've seen it. And every player in this film - from S.Z. Sakall and Dooley Wilson to Bogart, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid and Ingrid Bergman - is absolutely brilliant. More emotion you'll never see in a film - for my money. These actors are fully vested in this film and more complex and nuanced performances you'll never see. Every aspect of this film is genius - from the story to the cinematography (and...I'm not sure...but could one argue that this was the very first and very best example of the film noire genre - does this qualify? It certainly sets the standard.) The tension is palpable, the dialog crackles with wit and intensity...for my money this is impossible to top. And it stays taught right to the very end...and who could argue that the very last line isn't the very best and most memorable in film history (in a film replete with memorable lines)? It's a great romance, a great thriller, a great War movie...it succeeds on so many levels - most EVERY level. And it is so riveting! It thrills from start to finish. And these are characters that not only love people and truly love each other, which makes you care all the more about their fates. These are characters you fall in love with and come to admire deeply, for the heroism they display in the face of almost insurmountable odds. (Can anyone not be moved by Sam's devotion to his bristly boss, Rick? That relationship defines the word 'true friend.' I had a friend like that once - they do exist - but they are a rare breed...and how moving is it to see this kind of thing in action in Casablanca?!) These characters are examples for us all - and though imaginary, they are recreations of real heroes who existed at the time and defeated the forces of evil in World War II. Bogie fans, of course, will love this film (it is arguably his finest...which is saying a lot, since his performances in The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Key Largo and many other films were brilliant too), as will Ingrid Bergman fans (her performance here rivals her performance in Notorious)...but you don't have to be a fan of any of them to recognize their greatness in Casablanca. (Peter Lorre deserves a mention too - his work here is memorable and noteworthy; it's a shame he wasted his great talent in too many lesser films afterward - except, of course, for The Maltese Falcon, his re-pairing with Bogie - which made for a wonderful chemistry.) Wow!",10,2,3,28 December 2013
Gravity," Warning: Stupid Movie!
","I haven't reviewed a film in awhile but I was so appalled and insulted by this worthless, childishly written and ill-conceived film that I had to warn you not to see it! You're going to wish you'd spent your time more wisely! The writers, the Cuar√≥ns, don't seem to understand an awful lot, namely: space, technology, people, NASA, reentry realities, how people speak, philosophy (their attempts at philosophical statements are so corny and vacuous they sound like cheesy coffee cup sayings from the 1960s), and more. The writing is vapid, empty, unbelievable, the comments at times of crisis incredibly cheerful and unreal... Example: the character played by George Clooney (whom I admire and is the one shining light in this dreadful film, which he couldn't save in spite of his efforts) asks the character played by Sandra Bullock what town she's from, to get her mind off a crisis in space. Come on, guys! These astronauts would already know what towns they're from by this time in their lives! The writers are just...dopes! (Sorry!) Another example: Bullock's oxygen is low yet Clooney has her talk to him incessantly (and it's all stupid small talk that makes you want to puke) to stay focused - notwithstanding that this very activity (in real life) would cause her to use up her oxygen all the faster! This movie is an insult to the viewer's intelligence. It plays out like those childhood games we used to play on the playground - you know, hey, push this button, see if that one works! Hey - it does! No need for training, eh? Dumb, dumb, dumb - and you're going to feel stupid if you watch this flick. The only thing good are the visuals but those don't sustain a movie and they're not exactly the most state-of-the-art stunning displays of creativity ever. In fact, you don't feel you've seen anything new at all. I'm just really angry that Hollywood felt audiences would be so uninformed and unsophisticated that they would think this movie was anything other than what it is, namely, space trash! Want another example of how very stupid this is? Sandra Bullock spends much time in space, bare-legged and barefoot and actually returns home from space bare-legged and barefoot and essentially wearing underwear! Come on!The ending, too - without being a spoiler - is just so fantastically unreal as to make you shake your head. What was the studio that put out this hopelessly clueless movie thinking? Did anyone at all research what real space flight was like? Doubtful.Regardless - this movie's ignorance of its own subject is one thing. Its dialog is another. It's so amateurish to make one wonder what made these guys think they could get away with their incompetence.",1,5,10,5 January 2015
12 Angry Men," All Modern Filmmakers Should See This Incredible Film
","No car chases here. No crashes. No explosions. No loud noises. Very little music and no background music during the bulk of it. In fact, most of its action takes place entirely in one room and the action is the playing out of a grueling day in a dingy, hot and sparsely furnished jury room without pause. Yet this is one of the finest movies ever made. Better acting you will not find in most other films. And this puts modern movies - with all their stunts and special effects - to shame. This is an object lesson in what makes a great film. It's not noise and smoke and mirrors. It's a great story and great acting. You don't need a million cuts or scene changes. You need just one room if you have the essential elements, as this film proves.The tension is incredible - palpable and nonstop, the important story of intolerance unfolding in a series of surprises and the human interplay almost unrivaled. No bells and whistles here. Just one of the best stories ever featuring one of the best casts ever assembled. And one of the most memorable films you'll ever see.",10,1,2,3 January 2014
Hotel Rwanda," An Incredible Story And Performance By Cheadle
","I'd actually have given this 8.5 stars if I could have...but short of that, 9 fits more than 8. This is a gripping recreation of real events in Rwanda, well-acted, well-filmed and brought to life in all of its horrific detail. Upsetting - as it should be - but also eye-opening (for this side of the story is rarely told, but must be told). And Don Cheadle is awesome in this role. (Shame that he did not get a worthwhile follow-up to this film after he proved his ability to handle challenging roles and shine with greatness.)And this is above all a story of heroism, of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager whose bravery in the face of incredible risks should be legendary - and this movie certainly makes a great case for it.This movie also makes you realize how very little we are being told in the press about the goings-on in Africa - and makes you hunger for more information. All of which makes this movie all the more special and unique.Wow. What a story. What a film. What a performance by Don Cheadle. By all means see it!",9,0,0,2 January 2014
The Doors," Great Biopic
","Brilliant, brilliant performance by Val Kilmer - one of the greatest actors of his generation who's had all too few opportunities like this movie to really shine. This is one of his very best - and if it were his ONLY film, it would still establish him as a heavyweight, one of the best of the best. Like Gary Oldman's spot-on performance as Beethoven in Immortal Beloved, Kilmer has us believing we are watching Jim Morrison himself throughout this film. He channels the quirky and inscrutable showman brilliantly, in full color. Kilmer is absolutely stunning in this film. Incredible. The film itself has its imperfections - it doesn't quite rise to 10-star status - but Kilmer's performance is as good as it gets.",9,1,1,28 December 2013
The Grapes of Wrath," A Must-See Film For So Many Reasons - And One of The Very Best
","If this isn't the finest and most moving depiction of the human tragedies that occurred during the Dust Bowl era, I don't know what is. Yet it is much more than that - it is simply one of the finest movies ever made. Better acting you will never see - and while it's arguably (a very young) Henry Fonda's very best film, Jane Darwell puts in a performance you will never forget (and you won't soon forget her final line - one of the most historic, moving and memorable final lines in all of movie history). You can't get a better story than one written by John Steinbeck, of course, and the stark cinematography blazes new territory and remains fresh to this day. Even the 'lesser' character actors shine brightly here. Who will forget John Qualen's performance as Muley or John Carradine's performance as Casey? ...And that's just scratching the surface. Who doesn't fall in love with and care about the main characters, as they desperately try to survive the rigors of the Depression (and whom among us could withstand the horrors they went through)? This is a real story - one that every American needs to know; there is no exaggeration here. The inhumanity heaped upon the most defenseless during the Depression - as brought out in this film - is something few movies have brought out. This is the quintessential Dust Bowl and Depression film. The realism is incredible. The music helps move you to tears, too. The heroism so many of the characters display is not just moving - it speaks of a time when more people were truly noble. What a cast! What a story! What a film!",10,0,1,28 December 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Faithful Re-Creation Of The Swedish Film
","A very well-done film - and it rivals the quality of the original Swedish film it obviously emulates, in style and substance.Daniel Craig is great here as the male lead - it's one of his best performances. And the story is told with all of the edge and darkness of the original. I didn't feel the need - having seen the original - for its being re-made, but a friend took me to this film and it didn't disappoint.I disagree with reviewers, however, who argue that this film makes a feminist statement. Yes, a woman is abused here; but men are abused in other films, and in real life too. We're all human and we all face trouble from time to time - which is why we can also sympathize if not empathize with the female lead as she struggles to overcome a difficult past. You do not have to be a woman to feel her pain or root for her search for justice, if not revenge. We root for her just as we root for a Wyatt Earp when his brother is killed and another maimed by a band of outlaws. This is a story about injustice and a corrupt system that protects some very bad people - not unique in the annals of history or film (which is why we all can care and relate to it).Well done. Worth seeing.Does it rise above the level of its genre, that of a 'thriller'? I'm not sure. That's why I did not give it 9 stars. But it's an exhilarating and intense ride and rivets you to the very end.",8,1,5,4 January 2014
Gandhi," One of the Best Biographies Ever - And The Best About Gandhi Ever
","Stunningly filmed. A cast full of great, great actors, and Ben Kingsley at his very best. An incredible true story that demands to be told (and it sticks to the truth, which is rare in a Hollywood film). It doesn't get any better than this - in a biography. Kingsley delivers one of the finest performances ever captured on film. You instantly believe you're watching Gandhi and he stays consistently true to his character throughout this lengthy effort. What an awesome performance! To me, Kingsley's performance as Gandhi rivals Peter O'Toole's fabulous performance in Lawrence Of Arabia in greatness - as does this movie as a whole, on every level. And, in fact, given the choice to watch either film again, I'd choose Gandhi - if only because Gandhi's work made a bigger impact on the world, for the better, and his fight was more protracted and noble. In other words, the story here is the classic battle of Good versus Evil (unlike that presented in Lawrence, where the lines are not so clear - especially in retrospect). That's saying a lot - because I don't think anyone would argue that Lawrence of Arabia, the movie, did not set the standard for movie marathons, movies on the level of a Gone With The Wind (although that was, artistically, a greater triumph than Lawrence or Gandhi, I would argue). This movie is done journalistically rather than artistically. There's no attempt to inflate or make the story bigger than it was or the lines more dramatic than they were in real life - and that's, in fact, one of its strengths. That's what gives its believability and makes you care about the outcome. Plus - Gandhi, the man (as portrayed by Kingsley), comes off as one of those people you would have idolized and followed given he chance...certainly someone you'd given your eye teeth to meet (unlike Lawrence Of Arabia, toward whom I feel an indifference, at best). You really care what happens to Gandhi and those around him as the story progresses toward its inevitable end - which, by the way, speaks loudly to the times in which we live today. What an incredible accomplishment - from top to bottom! My only disappointment - following this film - was that Kingsley was never again given a lead half as great as this. Why did Hollywood not give him suitably major roles after this film? Makes you wonder.",10,1,1,3 January 2014
No Country for Old Men," A Good Film But Waste Of Better Talent
","If you like films depicting human trash playing out their cruel and evil deeds, you'll like this. It's well done and what I'm about to say undoubtedly clashes with what many others have said but I am a big fan of the Coen brothers and I just feel they wasted their talents on this film. This is a film of a kind we've seen before and there are others who do films of this genre better. It's also a genre I don't care for. I don't want to get down in the dirt with psychopaths and wanton sick killers when I watch a movie. And I don't think their depiction requires all that much talent. We've got Quentin Tarantino and others of his ilk doing those movies. What makes the Coen brothers great, for my money, is their comic brilliance - as seen in The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou, Intolerable Cruelty and so many other films prior to this one. That's where their genius and uniqueness lies. I feel they've lost their way - and this film was the first in their diversion off the path of greatness. What a terrible shame. Can they ever recapture their earlier greatness? I'm still waiting - but will forever revere them as two of the greatest movie makers of all time.",7,0,2,28 December 2013
Moulin Rouge!," Poorly Thought Out - Doesn't Even Work As A Musical
","This movie - to me (and I know I differ with most others on this movie) - is precisely how NOT to make a musical. For one thing - did they have to use old songs? There was something odd about that, and how they used them, that, to me, made this the #1 corniest musical of all time. Could they not have hired a talented songwriter or team of songwriters to craft songs that actually pertained to the story? That would have been nice. The acting, too, is really clich√©d. Even fine actors like Nicole Kidman come off badly here. Director Baz Luhrmann was going for some stylistic quirk that just made me want to gag. Poor acting is the result. The story line is SO hokey, too - and one that you've seen hundreds if not thousands of times. Nothing new here...it's SO predictable as to make you wonder: how much thought did writers Luhrmann and Pearce put into this thing? Like the reused songs from times past, this story is a retread of a retread. I am shocked anyone thought this was anything but a boring sappy work of an inferior mind.",1,8,16,3 January 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Hugely Disappointing And Not Pitt's Best - To Say The Very Least
","Nothing about this film is believable to me. The story's premise - someone growing young instead of old - is interesting but its execution here is faulty to say the least. It is internally inconsistent, in other words. The writers didn't think this premise through carefully enough, to make it play out as it likely would (even as a fantasy) - and Pitt failed to think it through, too (because his acting did not sell the premise).In fact, Brad Pitt's acting in this movie is incredibly poor - and it makes you wonder about Brad Pitt's level of taste as well as his depth as an actor. Is he only cut out for emotionless action movie leads? Pitt's delivery seems to change over the course of the film and often seems put-on and stiff. I only sat through this boring and preposterous film because someone dragged me to it and wanted to stay until the very end. After seeing it I remember sitting down with the person with whom I'd seen it and ticking off detail after detail that didn't ring true or was done really poorly. Even Pitt's makeup and costuming was jarring and amateurish - and I don't normally pay attention to this kind of thing. If you can look at Pitt as an old man and not feel like yelling at the screen some criticism like, 'who put on that makeup?,' you're not invested in watching a film. I wanted to like this film. I'd often told my friends it was cruel that we grew in wisdom only to become more frail as we get older - I'd often posited how it would be if we could somehow become more youthful with time. So I wanted to give in to the fantasy in this film but the concept was poorly done and impossible to enjoy on any level - for me, anyway. I tell you this - my idea of torture would be to have to watch this film again!",1,5,9,3 January 2014
Lincoln," A Near-Great Movie And The Best Of The Year
","Ignore the bad reviews and the lesser ratings given this picture. This is out-and-out a great, great film (even though it gets one or two details wrong - like the way Connecticut voted on the bill in question), with many great cameos and performances by some of the greatest actors of our day - not to mention the work of one of our greatest directors and movie minds ever, Stephen Spielberg.Daniel Day Lewis (as Lincoln) is brilliant here - as are Tommy Lee Jones (as Sen. Stevens), Sally Field (as Mary Lincoln), David Strathairn (as William Seward) and many other fine actors - in bringing an important but little-told part of history to life, with all of its many colors and nuances.And here's a side of Lincoln we haven't seen before - Lincoln the impatient and demanding power-broker. When he wanted to get something done, he wanted it done, it seems - and he knew how to get it done (even if it took some scheming to accomplish what he wanted to achieve). Mary's active role in the Lincoln Administration is also brought to life here in a way you don't see in other films. (In most other films, all they do with Mary is portray her growing madness, just one side of the picture.)This movie is the work of heavyweights and deserves recognition for its greatness. What an accomplishment! And it makes you feel like you were right there, at a pivotal and intense time in this nation's history, with much at stake. If you want to see what a great President looks like, look no further.Finally, this movie achieves a quality level rarely seen in modern films and you absolutely need to see it!",9,4,6,4 January 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill This Movie
","This is the first movie I have given one star on IMDb. I'm sorry - I'm sure it's my fault for not liking this movie (I must be missing something), but in my poor limited mind this movie seems gratuitously hateful, mean-spirited, inhumane and glorifying evil deeds. I have seen the first two parts (because friends of mine dragged me to see them) and I have to say that this is just the kind of film that made me not so anxious to go to the movie theatre anymore. This is the kind of genre that not only sickens me and shows me everything that is wrong with the world but also makes me worry that it will inspire sick minds to emulate the same kind of wantonness this movie revels in. In fact, I suspect it already has. I fear that some weak and disturbed minds might not get the 'joke' in the Kill Bill films (IF they have one; those that like them seem to think they're funny on some level or satires but I don't see anything funny about gruesome scenes and depraved murders) - and these people might go out and repeat what they've seen in them. It's funny - if you recall the furor Warren Beatty's Bonnie And Clyde inspired, for supposedly encouraging and celebrating violence - it's strange that the Kill Bill films didn't also draw the ire of the critics. Quentin Tarantino knows how to make a film, that's for sure - but not the kind of films that I feel should be allowed to be shown. It's films like the Kill Bill films that makes me think the movie industry should exercise more taste and control over what gets released - are there no standards anymore? With movies like these, why wonder why there is so much violence today? (But that makes me seem old-fashioned and an advocate of censorship - not a popular idea in this culture where we worry about the growing violence in our society yet don't ever open our eyes to the likely causes.)",1,2,4,28 December 2013
Groundhog Day," One Of The Great Romantic Comedies Of All Time
","With an exceptionally unique concept propelling a compelling and consistently entertaining and funny story, the script by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis would stand up well against any of the great romantic comedies of the 1930s. And Bill Murray - not your usual choice in a romantic comedy - is bursting with comic genius and energy in this film. It's one of his very best - and it's Andie MacDowell's very best. She surprises and delights in a natural and endearing performance as the girl-next-door beauty-type, Murray's romantic interest. This is one of those films that is so deep and satisfying on so many levels that you never get tired of seeing it - year after year. And if you ever hear 'I Got You (Babe)' by Sonny and Cher and DON'T think of this film...then you haven't seen it.",10,0,2,28 December 2013
Eyes Wide Shut," Disappointing And Over-Long But Some Good Elements
","An overblown movie that could have been much better if it had been much shorter and directed a bit better, the whole thing is an enigma. How did so many top name talents wind up putting out such a mediocre product? Even otherwise good actors put in less-than-average performances in this one, making you wonder what direction Stanley Kubrick gave them. In other words, did Nicole Kidman decide on her own to talk incredibly slowly to the point of poor acting and unbelievability or did Kubrick tell her to do so for some unfathomable reason? I suspect (since Kidman has done much better work in other films) that Kubrick was going for some weird stylistic twist that just did not work. Tom Cruise is also unusually stiff in many scenes. The pace is too slow, too, and the characters unsympathetic. It's hard to get into a movie where you disrespect the characters. That being said, there's a basic core story here that doesn't unfold until nearly the middle of the movie that becomes interesting and should have been the focus of this movie. (One wonders what impact this movie might have had had the middle scene not been censored - with monk-like shapes placed strategically over naked bodies.) Another thing: why Kubrick felt the need to make Kidman's character a poor example of a wife is curious and gratuitous. Another stylistic annoyance: the characters' constant repeating of whatever someone says to them is really grating; both Cruise's and Kidman's characters are made to do this. Much of this movie should have wound up on the editing floor. There are too many boring scenes - even when characters are absolutely naked. Speaking of which, Kubrick's showing of Kidman's bare butt in several early scenes is gratuitous and obvious - not having its intended effect because these scenes have no reason for being in the film (at least that I can understand). She's dressing - so what? How does that move the story along? (It doesn't.) Another big gripe: the final scene limps off lamely without any real character redemption or discoveries and then ends scatologically to shock - with a gratuitous comment that only trivializes this movie and makes you wonder what Kubrick and his writers were smoking. That being said, there was a kernel of a good movie here, but it was lost in an attempt on the one hand to make a bigger picture out of this tale than exists here and to shock on the other hand (and - PS to any Hollywood director who has not learned this yet: nudity, four-letter-words and sex do not shock anymore; they can, in fact, seem clich√© - as they do here). You know, what made some of the movies of the '30s so great was their crackling dialog - fast-paced, ingenious. The slow dialog in this movie produces the opposite effect - dullness. Incredible especially if you realize how many scenes of naked people are in this movie. The lesson here is clear: nudity does not make a movie interesting. A dull story is a dull story, naked people or no. Very ironic: here, one of the most boring movies ever, has perhaps the most nudity and sexual content of any mainstream film of its time. Makes you yearn for a return to the old movie ethic of the '30s. One final question remains unanswered: what about their experience (as real husband and wife) in making this movie caused Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman to divorce shortly afterward? I have to feel it had something to do with what went on during the filming of this albatross.",6,0,2,28 December 2013
When Harry Met Sally...," One Of The Greatest Romantic Comedies Ever
","Dearly departed screenwriter Nora Ephron's best - and that's saying a lot, because she was one of the best of her generation. BRILLIANT screenplay. So much wit to the dialog. So many pithy scenes. Billy Crystal's very best movie and Meg Ryan's too (although does she over-act on occasion, try too hard to be cute?; I forgive her - she's otherwise brilliant). The dialog and story are genius and, ultimately, very moving. The story is hugely relevant, too - the search for love in today's fractionalized society (especially in New York City). There are so many memorable scenes and lines in this movie, too - the sign of greatness - not to mention one of the funniest scenes in any movie ever (I won't tell you what it is but it's in a diner; after you've seen it for the first time, you'll be repeating the punch line for the rest of your life). This is also one of those movies you'll want to see over and over again - another sign of greatness. The late lamented Bruno Kirby also puts in a fabulous performance as Crystal's best friend. And while I'm not a huge Carrie Fisher fan, she puts in a commendable performance too, as Ryan's best friend and Kirby's wife. And if a lump doesn't come to your throat, or a tear to your eye, at the end, you're not a romantic. Any sentimental romantic will absolutely love this film - forever.",10,2,4,28 December 2013
Love Actually," Delightful Holiday Film - If You Suspend Your Disbelief (And Please Try)
","Touching, moving and yet a movie that leaves you feeling good - even if you shed a tear in the process. Yes, it's imperfect but it's so good in its better aspects that it's easy to sit back and just enjoy this good-time holiday pic. And helping us forget the few corny moments of the film are the many wonderful vignettes put in by a wide variety of fine actors. Also making this an 8-star movie are the touches of real life that ring true on a deeper level and speak to serious issues we all have to deal with - all the while providing comic relief in most cases (not all). I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Grant but he provides some wonderful comic moments here, as the British Prime Minister - including a somewhat Scrooge-like transformation that warms your heart near the end of this film. Bill Nighy is brilliant - and if you're not aware of his work, you will admire him after seeing this film. But perhaps Emma Thompson is the one who most gives this movie its greatest depth. It is her role that demanded the most acting skills and she rises to the challenge - as she always does. What a great actress - and even in this light comedy she impresses. There are aspects of the ending that are clich√© and could have been better but slog through the final concert scene and the airport scene because the final video statement will really get you, summing up all the disparate stories in one neat heart-warming visual commentary. You'll need a handkerchief - even though it's mostly laughs you'll enjoy. Because Love Actually does have its 'aw!' moments.",8,1,2,28 December 2013
The Mission," Incredible Story, Incredible Film
","If you think you've seen DeNiro's best, you have to see this film - true, too, of Jeremy Irons's performance. (If you think DeNiro is the same in every movie, typecast so to speak, you absolutely have to see his knockout performance in this movie, in which he proves his greatness - if anyone doubted that.) Lusciously filmed, this is a moving film of a real story everyone needs to know. And is it simply one of the best films ever made as well. It builds and builds and builds to its tragic end in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat. And this story is a side of the Americas no one ever talks about - if they're aware of it at all. Anyone who cares about what we did to the Native Americans in the United States needs to see what the Europeans did to the indigenous people of South America - as is brought out (at least one side of it) in this deeply touching movie about early power struggles in the New World. And if you think religious people were never true heroes or important and selflessly brave fighters for justice, then this movie will change all that. If you are unaffected at the end, you have no heart. Wow! What a story, what a cast, what a beautifully-filmed movie, what a great movie!",9,2,2,23 December 2013
Defiance," Best Movie of 2008 And One Of Craig's Best
","If this movie were not one of the greatest historically true stories about heroism in the face of impossible odds but were a thriller, a work of fiction, it would still work as one of the best films of the year. Yet it IS a true story, an amazing story, showing the best and worst of humanity. It's not been told before and it sorely needs to be told, and here, it's done almost to perfection.Those who haven't seen Daniel Craig at his acting best, too, need to see this film. In this film he proves his depth as a quality actor (for any ever doubted he 'had it'). Gripping and taut throughout, with a realistic, gritty film style that increases its intensity, this is a well-directed, well-edited, well-acted, well-filmed movie that keeps you riveted to the very end - and shocks you with what it shows. Yet it does have a certain satisfying redemption at the end.A story well told that needs to be told. And a movie that's worth seeing more than once.",9,0,1,4 January 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," A Tour De Force For Hopkins Yet Not A Film You'll Want To See Again
","This film has not aged well with time. It has a very dated feel to it now.But it's worth seeing for Anthony Hopkins' brilliant recreation of a monster and serial killer. If you haven't seen this film yet, you owe it to yourself to see Hopkins at his most creative best and for some of his classic lines and scenes - especially his now-famous improvisation regarding his culinary desires. (You'll know what I mean when you see it.)Jodi Foster is solid here, though her range as an actress is limited. Her face is largely emotionless unless it's showing anger - that's the one emotion she can amply express, for my money. I know I'm probably in the minority here, but I'm not a big fan of hers. She's like a female Tom Cruise. Great for action films, not so great for films requiring a lot of emotional depth. But she's good here.The sequels? AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS!!! THEY'RE HORRIFYING AND GLORIFY IN INHUMANITY - IN ALL OF ITS GORY DETAIL. THE SEQUELS ARE MOVIE OF A SLASHER-STYLE BREED. I am so sorry I saw the sequels. They sicken me to this day. So many gratuitous and gleeful mutilation scenes - makes you wonder if the movie makers were sick-minded!!! Why they chose to go that route makes you wonder. Maybe they misunderstood what made the original - this film - worth seeing. It wasn't the gore. It was Hopkins.",7,0,1,4 January 2014
Tombstone," One of the best westerns ever made
","This is not just one of the best Westerns ever made - but arguably the best and most true-to- its-subject movie about Wyatt Earp and the men and women who surrounded him. Not to mention the fact that Val Kilmer does a tour de force as Doc Holliday that absolutely has to be seen to be believed - and if this isn't Kilmer's best film, it's right up there. (It's a shame that Kilmer has not since been handed such a great role that suited him perfectly.) That guy is off the charts in this film! But all actors in this film put in stellar performances and there's not a sour note in the whole film. Plus, it rises above its genre - this is almost more a historical biopic than a Western (not that I dislike Westerns - I don't; I LOVE Westerns). I think John Wayne himself would have endorsed this film. And it does justice to Wyatt Earp, too, who's portrayed as he should be - not a perfect man, but certainly, in the end, a hero and one whose bravery was almost unmatched (short of Billy the Kid, some of the Kid's cohorts such as Dick Brewer, and, of course, Earp's sidekick, Doc Holliday). What a great story, shot beautifully...it's a movie you want to see over and over again. And...is anyone unmoved at the end? Because there's tragedy and there's true romance. True romance. Read about it after seeing this movie - this story (including his lifelong romance with Josephine Marcus - which we only see blossoming in this film) is incredible and it's a big piece of Americana. The men who played Earp in the early movies - who knew him, in fact, in his latter days in Los Angeles in the 20s - cried when he died. I never get tired of seeing this movie. These are people you would have wanted to hang with and fight with if given the chance. This movie even motivated me to visit the real town of Tombstone, still standing where it was in Earp's time, a relic of the past. I felt the need to get closer to a man who was that great, so brave, so heroic, so admirable. And this movie makes you wish you could have joined his band of lawmen/vigilantes. Incredible story, superbly told in this movie. And perhaps you'll feel differently about vigilantes after seeing it, too. For who else was bringing justice to a corrupt and lawless region at the time? And yet this movie - to its credit - also brings out the humanity and tragedy even when the killing of bad men is necessary. And the thankless role Earp was forced into.",9,0,0,23 December 2013
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," One Of The Best Comedies Ever Made
","Arguably the best Coen brothers film ever (and that's saying a lot), this work of genius would be in my Top 10 great movie comedies of all time, if I had such a list. The script is brilliant, as is the story. Then add the off-the-charts performances of so many top-notch actors starting of course with George Clooney (who puts in a bravura performance that brings to mind the brilliance of a Cary Grant), John Turturro (who was never better and never more endearing, stealing many scenes in fact as the backwoods Pete Hogwallop), and Tim Blake Nelson as the lovable but terminally dumb Delmar O'Donnell...but then there are the exceptional performances of so many great character actors it's almost impossible to give everyone credit. Charles Durning puts in perhaps his funniest comic performance ever (you have GOT to see him dancing!) as Gov. Pappy O'Daniel. John Goodman...what a performance he delivers, as Big Dan Teague! You have to see this film just to see the incredible job Goodman does here (one of his best roles ever)! Even vignette-player and fine character actor Stephen Root impresses as a blind radio station guy - what an imagination! He creates one of the most memorable comic characters you'll ever see in a movie. He leaves an indelible impression, one of the highest points of a film with many high points. He will have you in stitches. I'm not a fan of Holly Hunter usually, but here even she puts in a brilliant performance as Clooney's quirky and quixotic wife. Ray McKinnon as Vernon T. Waldrip and Frank Collison as Wash Hogwallop - both bit parts - shine brightly as well. The music's incredible too - I had to buy both the DVD of the movie and the CD of the score, the music was so endearing. This movie sizzles on every level and the cast and crew all were on the top energy level in synch and with a chemistry rarely seen in film. Can't top this. (And, by the way - if you like this film, by the way - try to see Preston Sturges' great classic, Sullivan's Travels, upon which this movie was in part based.)",10,1,1,28 December 2013
