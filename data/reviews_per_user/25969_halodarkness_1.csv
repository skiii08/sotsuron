The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," No Spoilers... It stays true to the book in essence
","Well i must say i wasn't expecting much as its a 'part 1' release but i think i would have it no other way because of the amount of extra freedom the producers had for detail and it stuck to the main plot line of the book with no alterations (i think thanks to Stephenie Meyer being a producer) So to all the awesome people who read the book you wont be disappointed in the film adaptation and to all the people who saw the previous Twilight saga movies this one was made much better in every way, the only sucky thing about it is the whole to be continued ending as it kills the mood but that is the industry known to you as Hollywood ever so awesome and cruel at the same time -_-",8,6,13,16 November 2011
