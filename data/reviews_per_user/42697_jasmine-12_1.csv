Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Best summer blockbuster in at least 16 years!
","While trying to compare this film to the original trilogy is a waste of time in my opinion, I can definitely say that TPM is easily the best sci-fi movie since Jedi, and is a great addition to the series.  Just watching the opening scroll gave me chills.  I feel bad for the person who was expecting top-notch acting, or an 'adult' movie, because those people obviously didn't get the point of the original movies.  Star Wars is about having fun while telling a great story with a lot of action.  The original Star Wars gave movie making a much needed boost towards quality effects and sound, and this movie should do it again.  If you don't like this movie, you must not have really liked the originals.  Thanks for your time!",10,0,0,26 May 1999
