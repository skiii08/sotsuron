Casablanca," Best movie EVER
","This is simply the finest movie ever made. EVER. The plot is perfect. The cast is sublime. The ending is fantastic. The performances by Bogart and Bergman are their best work. There are so many classic lines still used 65 years later. Here's looking at you kid. We'll always have Paris. This may be the beginning of a great friendship. The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world. Play it Sam, play As Time Goes By. The evil German's are perfectly evil. The dueling national anthems are timeless. The corrupt French Captain is perfect in a corrupt nether world like war time Casablanca. The relationship between a young star struck Elsa in learning to love her underground hero husband. her pain at learning of his death. Her finding love in a new man - Bogey. And her distress at learning her husband was still alive and needed her. It all made up for the pain felt by Bogey at being left in the rain at the train station with her dear John letter dripping away. Perfection in plot, in casting, in shooting in black and white for effect. What more can be said. You can watch this movie every day and pick up something new each time you watch it.",10,2,4,21 March 2008
