It," Have they forgotten how to make suspense?
","I have seen 2 movies this week. Mother & It. Mother was about 1 hour too long and the acting was terrible. It reminded me of the old Outer Limits TV show except that would have been done better. I guessed the plot very early on.'It' was also too long, not suspenseful, there were no moments of tension. My wife commented that it seemed to her a bit like an Enid Blyton 'Famous Five' story. Some of these directors need to go back to director school.",1,1,3,22 December 2017
Darkest Hour," Well that was underwhelming
","I was looking forward to seeing this given all the hype. Turns out it is a bit of a dud. They raved about Oldman's costume. IMO he didn't look much like Winston but that was redeemed some by his acting which was first rate. I have seen better Churchills make up wise. Lily James was very good. I am sure she will go on to great things given the opportunity. Plot wise, I felt that the subject could have been handled much better in a 3 or 4 part TV serial. This for me is where Hollywood falls down, they have failed to grasp that TV is in the ascendancy whilst they flounder. Most homes nowadays have large screens. 
Why the fantasy items. There is no evidence Churchill ever took the tube and interacted with common folk. Then the virtue signalling was unnecessary. And the tube ride from St James to Westminster lasted 5 minutes when in fact it is one stop and should have been just 1 or 2 minutes. Makes me wonder what else was made up.",6,1,6,15 February 2018
The Book Thief," Lovely touching tale
","I loved the movie so much on first viewing that I went out and bought the book. One of those occasions however where the movie is better than the written word. It surprises me that it seemed somewhat overlooked when on first release. Yes it is a bit too sentimental in places but that is what movies are sometimes meant to be, to take us out of our drab existence. The soundtrack is excellent too and by John Williams of course. In time I expect this to be a Christmas Day movie.",8,0,0,22 December 2017
Dunkirk," Awfulness
",Have directors forgotten how to make a great movie? There is no empathy for any of the characters because they do not take time to develop any of them. I gave it 40 minutes and walk away.,1,5,9,17 February 2018
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Lovly Movie
","I just wish they would make more entertainment like this. No bad language, no violence, just nice.",10,11,18,7 August 2018
Mother!," Terrible movie
","No suspense, terrible acting from the highest paid actress in Hollywood. All she does is scream. overly long ... by 1 hour. Plot was obvious from the beginning. It reminded me of an Outer Limits story from the 60's.",1,2,3,24 December 2017
