Blade Runner 2049," blade.run.away from this film
","This was utterly disappointing...the visuals & scenic portrayals, however, were incredibly spectacular...as the audience was taken on a journey into a bleak & hopeless future...but the acting was sub-par...the characters were bland...there was a lack of depth in any respects to emotion...could not connect @ all with any characters...ryan gosling is just a pretty face on screen...not much else to offer in this piece...he can never live up to ford's charisma...could've found a better lead...the story.line was okay...but it leaves the audience hanging @ some points...it just cannot compare to the original...young harrison ford was phenomenal... this is one of those films you can go watch on the big screen to escape into the year 2049 for one night...but don't expect much else...",2,4,7,2 April 2018
