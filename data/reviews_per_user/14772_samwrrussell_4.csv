Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Definitely underrated.
","I can under stand many of the complaints about this movie, but I think most people come up with complaints based on others. Recently the prequel trilogy has been receiving bad criticism by many who hardly know what they're talking about. When this movies was newer it(along with the other prequels)was looked upon as better and more exciting than the original trilogy. I knew many many kids who hardly cared about the original trilogy but was obsessed with the prequels. I think many of these individuals have changed their opinions because of what others think about it. I think if you stop comparing it to the originals, which i equally agree are superior,you will realize it is an amazing movie with great characters and settings. The beautiful thing about the phantom menace is that you get to see how the events in the original trilogy came into place.",10,5,6,11 June 2014
Gravity," terrible but entertaining
",I was skeptical going in to this movie. I thought it would be boring because it would all take place in space. Another concern was that there were only two characters. I later found out that was not how it failed; the problem was that not much went on overall. I think it would work better if there were more events leading up to were they had to abort there mission. The events were dragged out by introducing new problems frequently. Another main problem is that Koloski is lost early into the movie. I think it would work much better if him and Ryan got separated near the end. The drama was well done but did not have as much of an affect as it would of it wasn't constant. Since this movie fails in plot it excels visually. It was realistic looking and entertaining in that part. I think that this movie is worth watching just because of the entertainment value.,1,1,5,20 October 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Putrid movie.
","There's not much to this movie that stands out as good, it's basically an undated version of the first Spider-Man movie. This makes it practically a remake, however most remakes improve upon the original. This movie has nothing good to offer that the first movie didn't. Instead the villain is mediocre, and none of the characters are very good. The problem with making this movie not look like a remake is that they have to go out of their way, sacrificing what makes a good movie, to come up with ideas. There's no point in making a movie that doesn't have any thing to offer. Even if the preceding Spider-Man trilogy didn't exist it would still be a bad movie without a better movie to compare it to. Peter Parker's character wasn't what I expected, instead of being socially awkward he had a over exaggerated sarcastic personality. The only memorable actor was Martin sheen as uncle Ben. Over all this movie is not worth it.",5,1,3,12 May 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best action movie of the year!
","From start to finish this movie is engaging, entertaining,and exciting. The plot is simple and easy to understand; something that is lacking from many modern movies. The present is in chaos because Mystique's power is used for military purposes. In order to fix this the wolverine must go to the 1970's. He cant do it alone, so he must get the help of x-men characters from the time. This is the factor that makes the movie so entertaining, it's interesting to see them interact when they where young. It's definitely without doubt the best x-men movie and one of the most creative movies in a while. This is coming from a non x men fan so its easy to say that almost any action-movie fan can enjoy this movie. I highly recommend it.",10,2,5,11 June 2014
