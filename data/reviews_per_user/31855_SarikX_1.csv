The Blair Witch Project," Don't Believe The Hype
","Just a warning:  Do NOT sit too close to the screen.  The camera movement is unbearable at close range and you will find yourself running to the bathroom in search of a barf bag. The actors were great.  The story concept pure genius.  But the execution suffered from 75% of the shots showing nothing but floor/tree line/blur. I understand this was supposed to be a 'home movie', but my little sister knows better than to rock the camera SOOO much.  I did not buy the fact that supposed 'student film makers' wouldn't pay a closer attention to filming techniques.  Even when shooting interviews, the camera bounces as if on a pogo stick on speedball.  This killed it for me. As far as 'the scariest movie ever made':  NOT EVEN CLOSE. Watch if you must.",1,0,1,10 August 1999
