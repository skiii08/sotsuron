Spartacus," I'm Spartacus!
","This is an excellent film but that is not at all a surprise considering it is directed by Stanley Kubrick and his movies are all incredible, at least the most famous of his movies are.Kubrick also shot this movie after he took over for his cinematographer but because he wasn't credited that cinematographer took home the Academy Award so that is an interesting bit of trivia and I bet he wouldn't be too happy about that! Ha ha.The fight scenes and 'look' of the film are a bit dated of course but the writing and acting and direction of course are all still great and the movie holds up almost as good today.Kirk Douglas produced this movie so he could cast himself in the title role of Spartacus and that is probably the main problem of this movie. He is 45 here and obviously too old to be playing the young gladiator/slave Spartacus but if you suspend your disbelief it doesn't matter very much. He is actually quite good in this.This movie is worth watching just for the 'I'm Spartacus!' scene alone. What a great ending.",10,1,3,24 October 2017
The Artist," Very Good
","This was a very good movie. I think a lot of the success this movie had was due to the fact that it was done as a silent film which got it a lot of hype, most films aren't black and white any more obviously and nobody does silent much so when it did these things it got a lot of attention, obviously especially in Hollywood because they go nuts for any movie that's about Hollywood and movie making in general. It's amusing to me that the movie was all about Hollywood and set in Hollywood but made by the French. Also this movie is not a silent film! A movie is either silent or has sound and this movie was not silent for the entire film, the last scene has sound and dialogue. I know that is picky but a film can't have any sound at all in my mind if it is a silent film. I also wish there were more scenes with John Goodman and that he got more attention for his supporting role. The actor deserved the Oscar win, the lead actress was great too, and the film deserved winning for best picture, but it was also a weaker year. This movie was very good but not the status of great.",8,5,9,5 November 2013
