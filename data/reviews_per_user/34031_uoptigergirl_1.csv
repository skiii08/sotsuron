Black Swan," Black Swan...haha.. more like black mark!
","CLEARLY! everyone who has made a review, has ignored the GIANT ELEPHANT! in the room. Although, Natalie Portman, did a decent job executing the role of the Swan Queen, she did it in a very round-about, promiscuous way, that I found COMPLETELY unnecessary. This movie was completely pornographic, and quite frankly I lost count with how many sex scenes & sexual innuendos where plastered all throughout it's short duration. Apparently, most of the reviewers are okay with the highly vivid and offensive sexual content and for that, congratulations. I'm ecstatic that you enjoyed every repulsive moment of The Black Swan, but however; for some unforeseen reason, this movie got a rating of R, which it really deserved and X or NC17. Needless to say, I was EXTREMELY disappointed and disgusted by the movie was portrayed.",1,11,18,17 June 2011
