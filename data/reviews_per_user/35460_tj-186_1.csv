Hereditary," Thank god I didn't pay for it.
","My son who works at the movie theater took me to see this. This is one F'd up movies. Extremely slow, I couldn't wait until it ended or for something to really happen. People were laughing at some of the stuff. I can not understand why the rating on this is so high. There are so many things that are left unexplained. And some mentally gruesome things. There really isn't any blood and guts but it makes you think about it. I rarely give reviews but I felt I had to for this one. In my opinion, if you really want to see it, wait until it comes out on Netflix so if you don't like it, you won't be upset about paying for it.",2,26,58,14 June 2018
