The Incredible Hulk," A mediocre, mindless, dumb -though entertaining- action flic....with spotty CGI
","One of my favorite T.V. shows of all time, is '1970s-'1980s 'The Incredible Hulk' -starring the very underrated actor, Bill Bixby and his alter-ego........the renowned body-builder Lou Ferrigno.
This T.V. show's 2-hour pilot episode was very, interesting, superbly-well done, and very dramatic: Bixby -otherwise known as 'David Banner'- was involved in a car accident in which he was unable to save his wife from dying (if my 'recall' is correct). In his frustration to his wife's death, Bixby then begins experimenting with small doses of gamma ray doses to see if it will stimulate a natural 'adrenalin reaction' -the type of reaction that he LACKED at the time that he felt he SHOULD HAVE HAD IT when he was unable to save his wife's life.These controlled experiments eventually go awry....and Bixby in one freak accident of this controlled experiment transforms into the hulk, inadvertedly creating a fire which accidentally kills his colleague who was assisting him. I believe that Bill Bixby was born to play this role as the Hulk, and he plays it superbly; he is extremely likeable, charismatic, and it is very easy to empathize for him. He truly does come across as someone that is genuinely good......who is extremely tortured, always looking for a 'cure' to his dilemma...Having never read any Marvel Comics of any type throughout my life -which is still currently the case- my knowledge and interpretations of what The Incredible Hulk is 'SUPPOSED' to closely resemble have always been based on the original '70s-80s T.V. series.About 5 years ago, I 'attempted' to watch fairly new Louis Leterrier-directed 'The Incredible Hulk' movie -starring Edward Norton. I gave up after only about 10 minutes, as I realized that it was in VERY STARK CONTRADICTION to the T.V. series and my notion of what the Incredible Hulk is supposed to be like.....that is,MUCH, MUCH, MUCH 'DUMBER' and purely action-oriented and grotesquely fake and stupid compared to the T.V. series.That being said, very recently, I decided to give it one last 'go'.......and I finally just now -as I had nothing better to do- did watch in its entirety the Leterrier-directed 'The Incredible Hulk.'In recent years, some of the best 'superhero' movies ever.....have been made.....partly as a result of the directors having the knowledge and incentive to fully show the superhero's 'character development' in a very thorough, engrossing, and realistic approach that has never been done in the past: For example, the Christopher Nolan-directed 'Batman Begins' is easily the best Batman-directed movie ever, in my opinion; Batman's 'beginnings' are fully explained and very believably-developed in this film. To a great degree, this also applies to the movie 'Spiderman' starring Tobey Maguire and the first 'X-Men' movie starring Patrick Stewart.In contradistinction, the movie 'The Incredible Hulk' begins very 'unintelligibly' with little or no character development concerning Bruce Banner's beginnings or how he became the Hulk. The movie begins with a drop of his blood accidentally falling into a soda bottle or something similar to that. Somewhat later the military is actively seeking him. He then transforms into the Hulk.'The Incredible Hulk' pretty much is a pure mindless action movie which is centered on action sequences; nearly all of which are extremely unrealistic. The actual CGI used to create the Hulk's appearance is appallingly-fake....it is probably the MOST FAKE LOOKING 'humanoid' or 'monster' replication that I have EVER seen in ANY movie, EVER. It is absurdly-faked; grotesquely-fake. It is very possible that the actual APPEARANCE of the Hulk in this film -IS a much more accurate physical rendition of what the Hulk is SUPPOSED to look like than what he does in the T.V. series. It is also possible that in the D.C. Comics, that the Hulk is supposed to be utterly-invincible, unbelievably 'GARGANTUAN' (18 foot tall/several tons?), that he can take any amount of bullets from any type of gun or cannon, can leap DOZENS of feet in the air, and can free-fall 20,000 feet from a helicopter and not even break a bone.The end result -whether this is an accurate D.C. Comics-replication or not- is a LUDICROUSLY-fake and stupid movie that maybe should have been 'animated' -as it is much more like a bona fida 'CARTOON' than anything that has any remote realism.All in all, I rate 'The Incredible Hulk' 4 stars -- because it does succeed, to an extent, as a dumb, pure action movie.....",4,0,3,24 November 2018
No Country for Old Men," An uber-overrated pointless movie...
","No Country For Old Men is a dumb, pointless, purposeless, UBER-overrated, overtly-graphic and mean-spirited movie from very overrated directors (Coen Brothers). The cinematography is, admittedly, great and the movie is at least 'watcheable.' The movie starts out well and seems very compelling for awhile...but goes downhill throughout and the story seems to be half-concocted: Why spoil the movie with the untimely, undramatic, and unimportant death Bardem's primary adversary -Josh Brolin? Why not continue the duel between Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin leading to an epic and exciting showdown between the two at the end of the movie? Tommy Lee Jones looks and seems washed up (not because he seems uninterested) and mumbles throughout the movie. This is easily his worst performance I've ever seen. Javier Bardem is detestable and extremely mean-spirited -whether he was intended to be that way or not. He seems like an extremely dumb person and unlikeable person in real life who's acting skills are extremely-limited. When he speaks dialog in No Country for Old Men he sounds like a quasi-retard with a low I.Q. This is probably the only type of role he could ever play, me-thinks.The whole movie 'feels' completely devoid of purpose and completely 'dead.' I do enjoy 'violent' movies, perhaps more than I should, but like many modern flics, N.C.F.O.M. seems like nothing more than an engine for an occasional pointless, violent and overtly graphic death of someone. The lack of music throughout movie enhances the 'dead' ambiance of the movie. The fact that the public and 'critics' give a movie like this 'UNANIMOUS' high-ratings shows what an incredibly-stupid society it is that we live in.",3,4,12,18 November 2016
Casino Royale," A graphic, mean-spirited vastly overrated movie.
","How do you rate a move like this? Casino Royale is, by far, the most graphic, violent, and mean-spirited James Bond movie that up until now I have ever seen. Some of the stunts and action sequences were among the most amazing that I have ever seen in a James Bond film. Daniel Craig has some great physical skills that seem to surpass those of all previous James Bonds. He does seem to have a decent amount of presence and personality and in these aspects makes for an adequate James Bond. And yet he is easily the most unlikeable and mean-spirited of all the James Bond actors that I have become familiar with. He isn't nearly as likable...or as good-natured as say, Roger Moore...or even Pierce Brosnan (perhaps the most 'accurate' incarnation of any of the Bonds boys). The movie -as nearly all movies do- was clearly a microcosm of the era it was released in 2000s. I was a little annoyed at seeing Judi Dench using the vile and immature language of today with phrases that included 'a**' and 'prick.' It also cheapened the movie to see Daniel Craig say '...scratch my 'effin' balls...' Can you imagine phraseology like this being used by previous Bond actors?At 2 1/2 hours long I felt that the movie was very clearly 'overtly' long...and though the pacing was fine I felt that the action sequences were somewhat too far in between. Most of the way through the movie, I was 'waiting' for the movie to end and kept on 'pausing' the movie to find out how much time there was left. The cinematography and FX were very good......and yet all things considered I really didn't enjoy this movie at all.How do you rate a movie like this?YOU don't; I do: 4 1/2 stars.",4,3,6,1 December 2016
Spectre," A depressing, 'washed-up' lifeless Bond flic. Easily the worst Bond movie ever.
","I am actually currently very 'unfamiliar' with.......and have never 'officially' rated ANY Daniel Craig-era James Bond movies -until NOW.
Up until the 'Daniel Craig' era -- all James Bond movies -- even the 'worst' in the series -- have had a sense of 'magic' and 'charisma' as well as great action scenes and utilized 'techno-gadgetry' on a level that only few other movie franchises have. In my opinion, even the 'worst' James Bond movie that I can recall -up till the 'Daniel Craig' era- 'A View To a Kill' still effectively presented a certain level of 'magic' and 'intellectuality' and charisma and 'interest' that was befitting of this movie franchise. I recently 'officially rated' 'A View To Kill' -- and rated this flic 2 stars......and considered it to be, by a slim margin, the worst Bond movie that I could recall watching. That being said, 'A View to a Kill' is by no means a bad movie.....but it is 'mediocre.'
Daniel Craig, if nothing else, is perhaps an actor -- a 'product' of his era: Even though technically he is the first ever 'blonde-haired' James Bond actor....he does have a presence and a decent amount of 'charisma' and 'attitude' and 'demeanor' that is befitting of '007.' He is also -since he is a product of his era- easily the most stoic, serious, un-humorous and to a great degree 'mean-spirited' and vicious and sadistic James Bond actor -which, for me, makes him easily the least 'likeable' James Bond actor ever. He is in every way the 'antithesis' of esp. say, 'Roger Moore.' 007 actors such as Timothy Dalton, Sean Connery, and Pierce Brosnan on the other hand found the perfect balance between being intelligent, dangerous, and serious....but also being 'likeable' and having much charsima and screen presence as well.
Another attribute of Craig is that he seems to probably be the most 'physically-adept' Bond actor ever -in terms of fighting ability and stunts...The movie, 'Spectre,' starts out in Mexico City where 'The Day of the Dead' is being celebrated. The imagery and cinematography for this event is saturated with soft and dusty yellow/orange hues and tones give the impression that Spectre is transpiring in a day and age of a post-apocalyptic neo steam-punk world. The opening helicopter scene is probably the most amazing helicopter action sequence since the beginning of the 1981 Bond flic 'For Your Eyes Only.' After this scene.....the plot of 'Spectre' unfortunately lags into oblivion and remains quite 'uninteresting' -- only barely watcheable for quite sometime. The first half of the movie, 'Spectre,' especially......feels completely 'purposeless,' 'washed up,' 'pointless,' and 'dead.' All of the magic and interest that permeated Bond movies prior to the 'Daniel Craig' era are completely 100% absent in much or most of 'Spectre.' The cinematography -esp. during the first half- of 'Spectre' is dark, unimaginative, and uninteresting and is the antithesis of 'eye-candy': It is 'eye-salt.'There is a 'semi-okay' car chase scene in which Bond is driving an Aston Martin or Jaguar.....but this is a very overrated chase scene and fails in comparison to pretty much all other car chase scenes in all previous Bond movies. This chase scene isn't nearly as memorable as car chase scenes in Vin Diesel movies 'The Fast and the Furious' nor does it even compare to chase scenes in any of the movies of the 'Jason Bourne' franchise. Even the opening car chase scene of the 1981 Bond movie 'For Your Eyes Only' (when Bond and his female companion bound over trees and hills in a four-wheel drive utility jeep-type vehicle) is much, much more interesting and 'creative.'
The plot and pacing of 'Spectre' as well as the dismally-dark and depressing cinematography fortunately does become more 'intelligible' and interesting as the movie progresses, thank goodness. The scene where Bond chases villains -while Bond is in a plane and the villains are in vehicles- is definitely a fairly vintage 'Bond-esque' scene....one of the EXTREMELY FEW in the entire movie.
Ben Whishaw is unbelievably-terribly-miscast as a new 'Q' replacement. He isn't only '2 steps down' from the likeability and charisma and intelligence of the former 'Q' (Desmond Llewelyn) - he is '20 steps down': He comes across as very confused and uncertain and unintelligent.
Finally, the 'Spectre building complex' which comes into the plot towards the end of the movie doesn't embue anything resembling the sense of 'awe' or 'wonder' that villainous buildings/complexes embued in previous Bond movies -such as the orbiting space station in 'Moonraker.'
In my opinion, 'Spectre' is clearly the worst Bond movie that I have so far ever seen or 'rated.' It seems to have higher 'production values' than 'A View to a Kill.' But most everything about 'Spectre' seems 'forced,' lifeless, pointless, lacking in magic or interest and just completely 'washed up.' The opening theme music 'Writing's on the Wall' was merely just barely 'okay' -- and certainly far inferior to the Duran Duran theme song 'A View to a Kill' and most other theme songs from previous Bond flics. All things considered, I rate 'Spectre' 3 stars.",3,2,5,28 February 2019
