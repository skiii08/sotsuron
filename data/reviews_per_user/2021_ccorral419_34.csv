The Lobster," I'd rather eat lobster
","Director/Writer Yorgos Lanthimos, along with Efthymis Filippou, present a futurist film so out-of- the-box in it's storyline that it's hard to believe it attracted the likes of Collin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John C. Reilly. Set primarily in The Hotel, where single people must find a mate within 45 days or be turned into an animal, residents fill their days hunting 'free people' or watching mundane 'couple people' therapy presentations. While probably an interesting storyline in theory, the monotone dialogue delivery, the dark fill of the film, and the less than humanistic performances throughout painstakingly drag this bazaar film down. Farrell reaches far from his familiar film persona, yet one can't help wonder why he changed his body for this role and what attracted him to this project. Weisz's 'one note' character blends in with the rest of the 'one note' performances, and John C. Reilly is so under utilized it's amazing he'd want to lend his talents to the project. One can only think that these qualified actors must know something about the director that the viewing audience doesn't. And, one can only think that Lanthimos, with this his first English language film, was trying for a Wes Anderson, Spike Jonze 'HER,' Coen Brothers type film, but fell short, very short. Some will call this a comedy, however, you probably won't laugh at all. Others will call this film a master piece, however, you'll probably walk out calling it something completely else.",5,3,5,5 June 2016
First Man," Continuously shaky camera work and up close camera positioning hindered this film
","Director/Writer Damien Chapelle successfully wore both hats in his 2016 'La La Land' and 2014 'Whiplash' endeavores. However, in 'First Man,' where he carries only the director title, his presentation is hindered and overburdened by continuous and unnecessary shaky camera work and countless close-ups. While the tumble and shaking within the capsule provides a first-hand up-close and personal space travel experience, the moving camera rarely stops, and its proximity to the actors/action makes watching the film difficult and/or hard to understand what is being presented on screen. Ryan Gosling ('La La Land') is young engineer/test pilot/astronaut Neil Armstrong (1961-1969), determined to do what it takes to be the best. At home, his wife Janet (Claire Foy 'The Crown' TV) is holding their lives together, especially following a family tragedy. As we progress toward the first walk on the moon, Armstrong must weather several fellow astronaut deaths, distancing himself from himself and those around him. Claire Foy does a nice job with the little she is given, proving the women behind the astronaut is as much a part of the space travel experience as their husbands. The film has a terrific ensemble cast (Jason Clarke 'Zero Dart Thirty,' Kyle Chandler 'Friday Night Lights,' 'Shea Whigham 'Waco,' Corey Stoll 'House of Cards', Lukas Haas 'Witness,' to name a few). Yet, the on screen personas of Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) that writers Josh Singer and James R. Hansen (whose book 'First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong' the film is based upon) present are very contradictory to the personas many may know, and ultimately hurt the production. The space race between the US and USSR is given its due here, and the first space docking and the various space tragedies experienced are well represented. I really enjoyed the footage of the Moon's surface, if in fact that was actual real footage. Now, if only proven Executive Producer Steven Spielberg would have taken a strong role in the films overall presentation, 'First Man' could have been a more successful production.",Null,58,98,12 October 2018
Deepwater Horizon," Hold on to your life raft
","Director Peter Berg ('Lone Survivor,' ' Friday Night Lights') once again partners with Mark Wahlberg to light up the screen, sky and ocean for the retelling of the 2010 offshore drilling explosion deemed 'the worst oil spill in US history'. Berg makes an camera appearance as the crew shift takes place upon the ridge. Mr. Jimmy (the always terrific Kurt Russell) and Mike Williams (Wahlberg - again at his heroic best) feels somethings wrong at the shift change, especially with several BP big wigs aboard, particularly Vidrine (John Malkovich - successfully pulling of an accent). Berg is terrific at filling time and space with rapid dialogue, thus making the audience wait for the action. Gina Rodriguez ('Jane the Virgin') is Andrea, top crew person who created the floating ridge, while back home Mike's wife Felicia (Kate Hudson - we can never get enough of Ms. Hudson) awaits. Special Effects, Sound, Visual stimulation, Cinematography (Enrique Chediak - '127 Hours') and more are all on fire here (sometime literally), pushing the viewing experience to their limits. If there is a fault here, it lies in the initial camera work that is to close to the actual drilling making it impossible to visually understand what one is looking at. Writing credits are in abundance here, bringing the story and lives of the on screen characters to realistic life. 'Deepwater Horizon' is an action packed film for all. While these type of films don't always get recognized at Awards times, this one maybe break that curse.",9,3,7,1 October 2016
Hereditary," Devilish secrets take to long here
","'Shorts' director Ari Aster steps up to the big boys chair, with this somewhat suspenseful thriller about a family plagued with death at every turn, ultimately revealing devilish secrets. Favorite Toni Collette ('United States of Tara') and staple Gabriel Byrne ('The Unsual Suspects') are parents to creepy little Milly Shapiro (watch out for this new raising performer) and conflicted young Alex Wolff ('In Treatment'). When grandma passes, and an accident occurs, a visit to grief counseling brings a mysterious friend Joannie (terrific character actress Ann Dowd 'The Handmaid's Tale') into the family. Aster wears the hat of Writer here, and unfortunately gets in his own way with prolonged sequences between suspense, a haunting score that leads to little, and continued exterior shots of the house location that are supposed to invoke suspense but get old. Kudos, however, to him for the opening 'miniature set' scene that starts the film, an effect not seen before on the big screen. Across the board, the leads do their best to deal with suspense and uncertainty. However, due to the weak writing, Collette's character is left begging for acceptance, Byrne has little to do, and while the camera loves Shapiro's presence and Wolff's uncertainty, the overall experience is too drawn out and falls flat at the end. Suspense films are at a low this time of year, which can only be the reason 'Hereditary' is getting so much attention.",6,5,12,16 June 2018
Wind River," 'Wind River' should be recognition for its diversity in casting.
","Director, Writer ('Sicario') and Actor ('Hell and High Water') Taylor Sheridan presents a chilling film (shot in the winter of Utah, but set in Wyoming on the Wind River Reservation) that provides insight to the rough environmental and society obstacles the Wyoming Indian reservation face. Cory (Jeremy Renner 'Hurt Locker') is a local wildlife hunter recruited by FBI Agent Elisabeth Olsen ('Godzilla'), who is called in to help solve a reservation death. Along with reluctant local official Ben (Graham Greene 'The Green Mile') all three must fight the elements and secrecy that surrounds the death. With Sheridan as director and writer, he is in complete control of the storyline, slowly introducing various entities/personalities that could aid in and/or confusion the solving of the murder. Helping to establish the overall feel of the film is the outstanding reservation, mountain and winter cinematography by Ben Richardson ('The Fault in our Stars'). Driven by terrific reserved performances by Renner, Olsen and Green, the film is filled with outstanding secondary actor capabilities including those of Julie Jones ('Longmire' TV), (Kelsey Asbillie ('Teen Wolf' TV), Gil Birmingham ('House of Cards'), Martin Sensmeier ('The Magnificent Seven'), Matthew Del Negro ('Scandal' TV Series), Tyler Laracca (proving there are no small roles) and all the rig personal and officers (too many to name here). Quietly receiving producing credits here is Peter Berg ('Friday Night Lights'), and now that you know, you will see his abilities all over this production. 'Wind River' should be recognized for its diversity in casting.",10,1,6,17 August 2017
Last Flag Flying," Friendships built in tough times are the strongest when times are tough
","Last Flag Flying. There's no denying, Director Richard Linklater ('Boyhood,' 'Before Midnight') knows his way around relationship films. Here, the reserved Doc Shephard (Steve Carell) reunites with his former marine buddies 'the no holds bar' Sal (Bryan Cranston) and now man of the cloth Rev. Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) to identify and bury Doc's deceased son. With an unspoken history between the men, the reunion and journey is continually filled with tension. When by-the- book Colonel Wilits (Yul Vazquez 'Captain Phillips') tries to stand in the way of the guys mission, especially after truths are told, comrade in arms and best friend to the deceased Washington (J. Quinton Johnson - currently on Broadway 'Hamilton') join the men as they prove once again, friendships built in tough times are the strongest when times are tough. Based a novel by Darrl Ponicsan, Linklater and him have adapted a touching and honest film that equally pulls at your heart strings and makes you laugh. All the key players here are at the top of the acting game and should be recognized for their contributions. What I especially liked about this film was that the history between the men and the story behind the death were all told without flashbacks. And, when the terrific Cicely Tyson appeared on screen, one could feel the audiences appreciation for her years of screen presences. To date, this is the best all around film I've seen, and you shouldn't miss it.",10,35,58,27 October 2017
Youth," YOUTH is confusing
","Director/Writer Paolo Sorrentino ('The Great Beauty' Academy Award Best Foreign Film Italy 2014) once again brings his rambling film style to YOUTH, a film about a retired orchestra conductor (Michael Cain), his daughter (Rachel Weisz - 'The Lovely Bones'), his director friend (Harvey Keitel) and a fellow 'retreat' actor (Paul Dano - 'Little Miss Sunshine'). That much information you can count on. For the rest of the film, one can only guess what Sorrentino was trying to say and why. Cinematography (Luca Bigazzi) is stunning, the various retreat performances are intriguing (if not bazaar), Jane Fonda gives and interesting cameo performance (not necessarily worth Award consideration), while Dano, who has little to do here, transforms into his movie character (no spoiler here) which is worthy of Award consideration. Music by David Lang holds this film together, as does the terrific casting which brings many a compelling character. You'll walk out wondering why, and maybe that's a good thing?",7,0,2,29 December 2015
The Hateful Eight," Don't hate, celebrate!
","Three-hours and 10 minutes! That's how long it takes for accomplished director/writer Quentin Tarantino ('Pulp Fiction,' ' Reservoir Dogs') to tell the Post-Civil War story about two grungy bounty hunters (the terrific Samuel L. Jackson and Kurt Russell) trying to cash-in on their equally grungy catch Daisy Momergue (the amazing Jennifer Jason Leigh). When a blizzard hits, they find themselves stuck in a cold tavern with want-a-be Sheriff (Talton Googins - 'Django'), an aging General (Bruce Dern), and several questionable personalities (Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Demian Bichir, Channing Tatum). Only time will tell who is who, and who will survive. Tarantino proves once again, he knows how to tell a story, create characters and set a stage for suspense, action and intrigue. Jennifer Jason Leigh is all the buzz here for her performance as she is beat-up, spit out and chewed up time and time again. As 2015 becomes the year of 'ensemble' work, the cast here is performing at their individual and ensemble all time high. Could this film have been shorter? Yes! Could this film have done without all the usage of the 'N' word? Yes! Could this film have done without all the blood and guts? Of course! But, then it wouldn't be a Tarantino film. If the Academy can get past all the later, 'The Hateful Eight' could be one of the sleeper films to beat.",8,18,58,20 December 2015
"I, Tonya"," Unfortunate Lifetime TV Channel feel presentation
","Haven't seen director Craig Glliespie's 'I, Tanya' yet? Not to worry, you probably won't unless the amazing Allison Janney ('Mom' and 'The West Wing') gets nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Unfortunately, Glliespie ('Lars and the Real Girl' - 2007) presents a big screen film that has a cheesy TV Lifetime Channel feel. Adding to his odd documentary interview style directing here, is the over the top costume design by Jennifer Johnson, whose period outfits and extreme hair presentations are a distraction to the story. Margot Robbie (Tanya), best known for her 'Suicide Squard - Harley Quinn' character plays Tanya consistently hard, making it almost impossible to be believe her character and/or feel sorry for her predicament. The handsome Sebastian Stan (Jeff - Tanya's wild husband behind the mustache) is a pleasant contrast to Robbie and Janney's (Tanya's hardcore mother) bull in a china shop relationship. Character actor Paul Waiter Hauser does a nice job here as the guy behind the Nancy Karrington (played briefly by Caitlin Carve 'Paper Town' 2015) attact. Odd as his character is, he comes across as the most believable in the film. Regardless of the above, enough can't be said for Allison Janney's commitment to her in-your-face, foul-mouthed, distraught, put upon character. Because Janney is so well know for her current and past nice gal character roles, watching her in this role is both hard to watch, yet somehow extremely satisfying. If Glliespie has any credit coming his way for 'I, Tanya,' it's his casting of Janney in this Award worthy role.",7,1,4,5 January 2018
BlacKkKlansman," A reminder we haven't advanced very far
","Film Review: BlacKkKlansman. Director Spike Lee ('Malcolm X') returns to the big screen with a current look back at the 1970's emergence of the Ku Kluk Klan. Enter rookie black Colorado Springs cop Ron Stallworth (the charming and self driven John David Washington - son of Denzel Washington), who is brought on to the force because he can talk 'normal' and 'jive'. When an opportunity to spy on visiting revolutionary Kwame Ture (the empowering Corey Hawkins 'Straight out of Compton), Ron begins his infiltration into the both the black empowerment movement and the Ku Klux Klan, eventually meeting its leader David Duke (portrayed convincing enough by Topher Grace 'That 70's Show'). Linking him to both groups are the strong-fast President of the Movement Patrice Dumas (Laura Harrie ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'), and Klan's men Walter (Ryan Eggold 'New Amsterdam' TV), wild man Feliz (Jasper Paakkone 'Vikings' TV), his bubbly wife Connie (the terrific Ashlie Atkinson 'Crashing' TV), and goof-ball scene stiller Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser ' I, Toyna'). Reluctantly at Ron's side are fellow officers Flip (one of the hardest working actors Adam Driver 'Girls') and Jimmy ('Blended's' Michael Buscemi - brother of Steve Buscemi), both who learn a lot from their involvement. While Lee's presentation is a bit stagey throughout, especially the opening informercial by Dr. Beauregard (an out of place Alec Baldwin) and the various floating faces during Ture's speech, it does help to establish the time, place and feel of the 1970's community. As usual, Lee has a lot to say about 'the day' and today, creatively interjecting current political climate catch phrases like 'Make America Great Again' to establish his point that we haven't advanced very far as a society. Lee interjects this association at just the right time in the film, making the films final moments coincide with footage from the recent Charlottesville White Nationalist Rally that stuns the viewing audience into silence. If nothing else, the last few minutes of 'BlacKkKlansman' says it all.",9,26,62,9 August 2018
Black Mass," A Black day in deed
","Director (Crazy Heart) Scott Cooper takes chameleon Johnny Depp deep into a unique character that serves him and the storyline well, and should bring Depp Oscar consideration. With a star studded ensemble to large to single out (all with terrific performances), this true story about South Boston's infamous criminal turned FBI informant Whitey Bulger hits all the right Irish mobster moments. Screen writers Mark Mallouk and Jez Butterworth set the characters in motion in an 'All the Presidents Men' behind the scenes fashion. You may think you don't know this story. However, by the end of the film you'll be reminded how recent this story ended.",8,1,5,30 September 2015
Suicide Squad," It's suicide to waste your money on this overly hyped production
","Director/Writer David Ayer's (Fury - 2014) takes his turn at yet another DC comic-book to film project. With the less than successful track record of this genre of films, one can only ponder why Hollywood keeps making them. Regardless, Ayer's cast a bevy of Hollywood personalities (Will Smith, Jared Leto, Viola Davis, Common, Jay Hernandez, Adele Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Margot Robbie and Robin Atkin Downes), all with their own corny DC comic-book names, to destroy a super entity that is in search of its heart - really? The only thing missing from this possibly plausible fantasy film is Spiderman swooping in to the rescue. Note: Batman is present in more ways than one. While the main characters are given a timestaking introduction of their vicious deeds to establish their greed, when gathered together they end up being nothing more than a bunch of semi-polite con- artists caught between a rock and a hard place, or in this case caught between guns and a killer cellphone App. Unfortunately, their is no need here to highlight who is the most exciting villain, because they are all equally boring, over acted, or just down right not interesting. Not helping matters is Ayer's dialogue, that comes across as nothing more than a bunch of one liners tied together to make plot. The special and visual effects are nothing new, and sometime the cinematography is too fake (look for the scene where the camera is behind a solider looking down on the city in the helicopter, or when Harley Quinn is making her escape, I could go on!). While 'Suicide Squad' is a DC comic stable (so I heard), the excessive use of guns and violence in the film is far from child proof. It's suicide to waste your money on this overly hyped production.",Null,1,2,6 August 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Stagy dark comedy with good acting
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. When a film is so highly spoken about it can mean one of two things: 1) It's going to be a great film, or 2) the praise is being overstate. Unfortunately, 'Three Billboards...' falls into the later category, as director/writer Martin McDonagh ('Seven Psychopaths' 2012) presents an intriguing dark comedy that ultimately comes across as a variety of individual scenes put together to make a story. Featuring Frances McDormand ('Fargo'), Woody Harrelson ('The Hunger Games'), Sam Rockwell ('The Way Way Back'), Luca Hedges ('Manchester by the Sea'), Caleb Landrey ('Get Out'), Zeljko Ivanek ('Argo') and Peter Dinklage ('Game of Thrones'), the acting is not the problem here. McDonagh's sets are stagy, his writing is lackluster, he tends to add in scenes/character in order to oddly move the story along, and the ending does nothing for the flow of the film. Standing out in this heavily star packed film is Caleb Landrey. Landrey is initially had to understand, due to an unexplainable accent, however, he over comes this weakness by graciously playing the victim. 'Three Billboards' is far from a clunker. I guess I just expected a more tightly woven and satisfying production.",8,3,6,15 November 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Relive the 70's and the rise of Queen!
","Director Bryan Singer ('X-Men' series) brings the life of Queen's frontman Freddy Mercury (Rami Malek 'Mr. Robot' TV) and the band to the big screen with a vengeance. With screenplay by Anthony McCarten ('The Theory of Everything') and story by McCarten and Peter Morgan (Writer, Producer, Actor), the film chronicles the mates climb to music notoriety, highlighting Freddy's frontman antics, the now notorious 1985 'Live Aide' concert performance, and of course the death of Freddy to Aids in 1991. Malek, who is unpleasantly overly made up to mimic Freddy's unique jaw line, teeth and hair, is plausible as the driven young British Zanzibar vocalist Farrokh (his given name). As the mature Freddy, he's given all the outrageous costumes (by Julian Day) and Freddy's dances moves, and pulls them off with ease, even though his lip-syncing is over the top at times. What Director Singer does well here, is provide backstory to the raise and demise of Mercury, including a look into his personal family dynamics, his little know love affair to Mary (Lucy Boynton 'Murder on the Orient Express'), who graciously sticks by him through his ups and downs, and a look at the effect Freddy's significant lovers Paul Prenter (Allen Leech 'Downton Abbey' TV) and Jim Hutton (Aaron Mccosker 'The Astronaut Wives Club' TV) had on his life, both who give moving subtle glimpses into Freddy's behind the glamour world. To McCarten and Morgan's credit, they provide an in-depth look at Queen's band members bassist John Deacan (Joseph Mazzello 'The Cure'), drummer Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy 'X-Men: Apocalypse') and guitarist Brian May (Gwilym Lee 'Jamestown' TV), demonstrating that the band was truly comprised of all four guys. As with most music oriented bio-pics, the film is packed with all the music and excitement one expects from Queen, and it's loud and powerful. Mike Meyers ('SNL') has a nice cameo as Queen's EMI chief Ray Forster - although I think I saw and heard 'Austin Powers' in his performance. And, Aidan Gillen ('Game of Thrones') does a nice job as the guys music manager John Reid. Only a fool would pan this film, so check it out for yourself, and relive the 70's and the rise of Queen!",9,97,167,23 October 2018
Dunkirk," Did our soldiers sacrifice for this?
","Director/Writer Christopher Nolan ('Batman' and 'The Dark Knight' series) is no stranger to big budget/loud productions, and for that reason he should know that actors need to mic'd correctly in order to understand their dialogue. However, in 'Dunkirk,' at least three-quarters of the films dialogue is in audible due to the period accents of it's actors and the continuous gun battles, overhead plane attacks, sinking and colliding ships, rough sea sounds and more. Does this ruin the film or storyline, not really, but it surly doesn't help. 'Dunkirk,' if anything, is a visual film that takes the audience on a journey of survival as its young Belgium, British Empire and French soldiers find themselves evacuated on the ocean front (Dunkirk, France) as the German's attack from land, sea and sky and they await their rescue. The film is filled with a variety of familiar names (Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Harry Styles, relative new comer Fionn Whitehead), along with a whole slue of handsome young men, all who do a great job dodging bullets, leaping from sinking ships, evacuating from downed planes and swimming for their lives. However, throughout the film I kept finding myself fighting my own battle to understand the dialogue. Tragic as the films story was, at the end of the film I couldn't help feel sorry for the soldiers (deceased and survived) knowing that they experienced such trauma to today be represented by a self-center administration as we find ourselves involved with. While the acting is good, special effects terrific, cinematography outstanding and the score is haunting, 'Dunkirk' is not the film so many are making it out to be. The disappointment here lies in the hands of the director and sound department.",8,2,6,28 July 2017

Room," Children are amazing
","Experiencing this film, and it is quite the experience, you will see why actors Brie Larson and Jacob Temblay are receiving accolades left and right. Director Lenny Abrahamson manages to capture limited space with beauty and elegance, when neither are in play within this film. He is helped with this presentation through the terrific writing, screenplay and novel by Emma Donoghue, who provides the audience a look inside the world of the missing child. The story, according the Donoghue, is not based on any one story, but one can't help feel the story is familiar and current. Within the film there are a variety of additional stories that make one think, such as News Reporter (Wendy Creson) Q&A's, the kidnapper's (Sean Bridgers) thought process, parental (Joan Allen and William H. Macy) accountability, and a whole lot more. The combination of relatable story lines makes this project important and relevant. Cinematography by Danny Cohen ('The Danish Girl') takes the audience inside young Jack's (Temblay') point of view as he discovers the world he never knew, adding yet another layer to this amazing film. Don't miss this one!",10,0,5,26 January 2016
Call Me by Your Name," Forbidden love, heartbreak and strong family values filled this terrific film
","Relative unknown Director Luca Guadagnino ('A Bigger Splash' 2015) has hit the movie jackpot with this at times painstakingly slow moving storyline that ultimately proves a backdrop for forbidden love, heartbreak and strong family values. While Awards talk is high across the board for actors Armie Hammer ('The Social Network') and Timothy Chalamet ('Lady Bird') - especially his final scene in the film, the breakout performance (in my book) here is Michael Stuhlbarg (TV's 'Fargo') who embodies the soul of a thoughtful and honest father, and who delivers one of this years best end of film monologues - kudos to writer James Ivory for these final words of self revelation and wisdom. Also standing out in this film is French actress Esther Garrel ('17 Girls'), who graciously walks the line of the young women on the outside. As beautiful as the film develops into, the heart of film really doesn't get started until the proverbial fruit is pulled from the tree. Yes, cinematography (Sayombhu Mukdeeprom) sets the carefree warm summer Italian villa mood, and Ivory's story about this educationally astute family is appealing, but I wanted more of everything at a faster pace. Not to be missed here is the films score, written by Giorgio Moroder and Keith Forsey, featuring amazing songs by Sufjan Stevens. There is a lot of great emotion within this terrific film, especially towards the end, so stick with it.",9,9,22,30 November 2017
Everest," Climb for your Life!
","In the capable hands of well awarded Iceland Director Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns - 2013), this retelling of the 1966 climb to 'Mt. Everest' is a reminder that well friendships are important and depended upon when fighting the elements, they can also be a hindrance. Writers William Nicholson (Gladiator - 2000) and Simon Beauofy (Slumdog Millionaire - 2008) don't over write the events, instead they let the location and the situation speak for itself. While the film is packed with plenty of familiar faces (Jason Clark, John Hawkes, Emily Watson, Keira Knightly, Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal and Robin Wright - to name a few), many have not been casted in such a unique setting, and thus their performances are realistic and note worthy. Presented in 3D, the sheer madness of the films situation, and the magnitude of the mountain environment, don't require any additional visual effects. However, watching the film on a large screen is recommended.",8,1,2,20 September 2015
Don't Breathe," Proof there are good scary films to be made
","Director/Writer Fede Alvarez, along Producer/Writer Rodo Sayagues, know a thing or two about scary and suspenseful films (Evil Dead, Panic Attack). Here, three young low level hoodlums decide to rob a blind man (well played by Stephen Lang - the 'Avatar' series) who lives in an abandoned neighborhood in Detroit. Rocky (the edgy Jane Levy - TV's 'Suburgatory') is the female attraction to the gritty Money - that's his character name - Daniel Zovatto (TV's 'Fear the Walking Dead) and wholesome Alex (cutie-pie Dylan Minnette - TV's Scandal). With a plausible storyline and terrific acting by all involved, things and situations go south quickly, leaving the audience little time to breathe. To Alvarez's credit, he doesn't include any of that typical unnecessarily busy camera work associated with many of today's horror films, so the audience finds themselves easily walking the walking (at times in the dark) along side the characters. There is a not so plausible subplot that comes to light towards the end of the film, but luckily it manages to not weight down the overall experience. 'Don't Breathe' is small film filled with big suspenseful, proving there are still good scary films to be made.",9,4,9,7 September 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Tired of musical movies...
","Director Bill Condon ('Dreamgirls' - 2006) knows his way around real-life big budget films, however, his current special/visual/CGI effects film is too dark (literally it's in shadow throughout much of the film) to be thoroughly enjoyed by it's primary audience - children. As for the 'gay' issue, PLEASE! Guys briefly wearing female clothing and/or a few seconds of two men dancing together does not make a gay film. To Condon's credit, he doesn't change the story much, so if you've seen the animation and the live theatre production (and who hasn't?), there's really no need to see this version. Belle (played by all grown up Emma Watson 'Harry Potter') does a nice job, giving her Belle more of self assured female presences. The Beast (Dan Stevens - Matthew from 'Downton Abbey) costumes and make-up is terrific, and Stevens' managers to display a nice warm conflict in emotions throughout. On the other hand, Gaston (Luke Evans 'Dracula' 2014) is over the top in dialogue and jesters, making his character a Laurel and Hardy team opposite LeFou (Josh Gad 'Book of Mormon'). While it's always great to see Kevin Kline on the big screen, his Maurice didn't feel connected to the story, and the 'antique' VoiceOvers (Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Audra McDonald and Stanley Tucci) were fun in CGI format, when they transformed back to human, it was all too stagy for my enjoyment. In fact, the big wrap at the end was really the end for me. Maybe I'm just tired of film/TV musicals?",5,4,11,22 March 2017
Sicario," Who are you actually working for?
","Director Denis Villeneuve ('Prisoners' 2013) crosses the U.S. boarder with under-the-radar agents Matt (Josh Brolin) and Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), as they enlist FBI agent Kate (Emily Blunt) and her partner Reggie (Daniel Kaluuya - 'Johnny English Reborn') to infiltrate the Mexican Cartel. Unfortunately for the by-the-books FBI agents, the mission is filled with more backstory then they are initially informed. Under Villeneuve's superb direction, the outstanding writing of Taylor Sheridan ('Sons of Anarchy Sons of Anarchy' - FX), and supported by the eerie sound track of Jóhann Jóhannsson (Composer - 'The Theory of Everything'), Brolin and Del Toro are at their all time best. However, it is Emily Blunt's bad-ass agent persona, who takes all the hits, strives to stand up for her values, and is left to make a decision that may cost her her life. If Steven Soderbergh's 'Traffic' (2000) or Bryan Singers' 'The Usual Suspects' (1995) are your type of movie, 'Sicaro' will not disappoint.",10,4,9,8 November 2015
The Disaster Artist," One of the Best Films and Performances of the Year
","Actor/Director/Producer James Franco has arrived, and you should not miss this outstanding film about Tommy Wiseau, the writer/director/actor of the now cult status film 'The Room' - if you been in Hollywood over the past several years you've probably seen the numerous billboards for this film that no one saw. While 'The Disaster Artist' is filled with numerous terrific familiar actors (Dave Franco, Seth Rogen, Ari Graynor, Alison Brie, Jacki Weaver, Paul Scheer, Zac Efron, Megan Mullally, Sharon Stone, Melanie Griffith, and the lis goes on and on), it is James Franco's Tommy character that is the heart and soul of this film. Where other actor/director/writes have failed this year (Kenneth Branagh - Murder on the Orient Express), James Franco knows how to use his stellar cast, while being able to commit to his odd character and oversee a quality entertaining film. So perfect and committed is James Franco to this Tommy character, that his performance ranks up there with such memorial characters at Tom Hanks' 'Forrest Gump' and Dustin Hoffman's 'Rain Man.' The thing is, the film and the main character are so unique, and the 'real life story' so farfetched and unknown, that Hollywood can't seem to find a way to get audience members into the theatre to witness the magic that James Franco has brought to the big screen. Equally sharing and filling the screen is Dave Franco as Greg (whose book the film is based upon), the handsome young actor who befriends Tommy, and together they make what maybe be the best of odd friends and the best worst movie of its time. Yes, there are other big films that will warrant your movie going experience, and other lead actors who will probably fill the 'Best Actor' category during Awards time. However, if your looking for something extremely entertaining and oddly enjoyable 'The Disaster Artist' should not be missed. I think this film ranks up there with one of the Best Films and Performances of the year.",10,2,5,30 December 2017
Steve Jobs," How Many Steve Jobs movies is too many?
","How many Steve Jobs movies is too many? We may never know, as Director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours) and Writer Arron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, TV's- Newsroom) come together to present a rapid paced behind the scenes look into the world of Steve Jobs, his personal relationships and demons, the history of Apple, and the launch of the iMac. Michael Fassbender doesn't start out a likely candidate to play Job's, however, his commitment to the character and later transformation is spot on. Kate Winslet is equally in her acting element, as Job's longtime assistance (slight accent and all) Joanna Hoffman. Rounding out the top billing is 'it' man of the hour (and consistently excellent) Jeff Daniels as Apple's headman John Sculley, and Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak. This film succeeds due to the Boyle's directing and Sorkin's confrontational and intense dialogue that captures and draws the audience in. Actors Michael Stuhlbang (Seven Psychopaths), Katherine Waterston (Inherent Vice) and the various youth actors portraying Jobs' daughter Lisa (Perla Haney-19; Ripley Sobo-9;Makenzie Moss-5) are perfectly cast as thorns in Jobs' side. If enough movie goers see this film, Director Danny Boyle, and several of the aforementioned actors, will be recognized come Award season.",10,14,33,28 October 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," Caesar salad, rather than Hail, Caesar!
","What do you get when one of the best directing/writing teams of Ethan Coen, Joel Coen (No Country for Old Men - 2007, The Big Lebowski - 1998, and Fargo - 1996) gathers an array of top billing actors (Josh Brolin, George Clooney, Ralph Fiennes, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Frances McDormand, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Wayne Knight - Seinfeld, Alison Pill - The Newsroom) for a period piece about 1950's communist in the movie industryABSOLUTE DISASTER! Featuring a corny storyline, a waste of many a worthy actor ability, and just plain not funny, this has to be one of the Coen Brothers worst productions ever. Of the numerous actors who show-up/cameo here, there isn't one performance worth noting. Everyone was probably under the Coen Brother spell 'If it's a Coen Brother's film, it will be good'. Joke is on them, and us as the viewing audience. Running 106 minutes, I'd rather go to a restaurant and enjoy a nice leisurely caesar salad!",1,5,13,26 February 2016
Murder on the Orient Express," A monotonous viewing experience
","Director/Actor Kenneth Branagh (Dir.: 'Cinderella' - 2015, Actor: 'Dunkirk' - 2017) and writer Michael Green ('Green Lantern' - 2011) toss CGI special effects, a packed and at times confusing storyline, and all kinds of celebrities (Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Josh Gad, Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench and a whole slue of others) at this famed Agatha Christie novel turned movie to unexpected boredom. The blame here lies in Branagh's hands, as he stars in and directs. Across the board, the top notch actors seem to be just going through the motions and/or involved in the production as a favor to their friend and theater company member Branagh. It doesn't help that Branagh's direction is overly staged at every turn, to the extend it appears the various scenes start and stop with little smooth transition. So many situation presented just don't make sense here, such as: How does a large train that is derailed get back on the tracks without any machinery? How can characters nonchalantly talk out in the freezing weather without jackets or walking on snow without any sound of the snow crunching below them? If the train isn't not running, how is it that heat, lights and cooking continues, and on and on, and on. One can quickly see how this film will develop from the beginning of the film, where the 'Wailing Wall' suddenly becomes a site for one of Hercule Poirot's (Branagh's character) cheesy detective resolutions. The story behind Agatha Christie's novel is all there, it's just Branagh's creepy mustache and mumbling dialogue delivery, coupled with the overly staged scenes and lackluster cast, just make this film a monotonous viewing experience.",5,3,6,6 December 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Pet Lover's Delight
","It's a 'Despicable Me' reunion (don't let that turn you away), as director Chris Renaud, writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, along with director Yarrow Cheney (How the Grinch Stole Christmas, 2018) gather to get inside the hearts and minds of our little furry/scaly/feathered friends. With fun music by Alexandre Desalt (The Danish Girl 2015), a list of Who's Who cool VO actors (Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Dana Carey, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell - the list goes on), and realistic animation courtesy of Illumination Entertainment, new, old and foreseeable pet owners (young and mature) will find great delight in this easy and entertaining to watch animation production. To the credit of the writers, all the obvious 'pet jokes/mannerisms' and current society references aren't forced on the viewer at one time. Thus, the film keeps giving throughout. Sure, about 3/4 the way in the idea grows a bit old, but the cuteness factor quickly returns for a rewarding finish. FYI: Don't let the less than funny 'DM' Short that pre-empetes the film cloud your judgment. While Children (and there are plenty in attendance) really enjoy all things 'DM,' there were few adults enjoying that experience. Illumination Entertainment is pre- viewing 'Sing,' due out in 2016, which also looks promising. Ruff, Ruff!",9,25,43,13 July 2016
Arrival," A fresh look at a genre we know well
","Director Denis Villeneuve (Sicario - 2015) provides a new look at the 'alien' film, giving both a new space craft to marvel and explore, new alien sounds, and a different kind of creature to interact with. For these reasons alone, the film is a success. However, with a complicated screenplay by Eric Heisserer (based on a short story by Ted Chiang), it is the backstory that continually gets in the way of an otherwise intriguing viewing experience. Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker) calls in linguist Amy Adams (exceptionally terrific here) and Scientist Jeremy Renner (playing second fiddle to Adams) to decode the alien chat. All is well and exciting until Adams starts having flashbacks/forwards (I couldn't tell) that somehow relate to the story and hold the secret to the world not falling into despair. When the film ended, I couldn't help but wonder 'what happen'? Music is at times predictable Sci-Fi (Jóhann Jóhannsson), yet it is equally calming and helps move the mystery of the experience along nicely. Cinematography, especially inside the spacecraft, is terrific by Bradford Young. You'll probably read that 'Arrival' is the 'Close Encounters' of our day and/or that the film is Stanley Kubrick oriented. Well I say, it's just another alien film that manages to provide a fresh look at a genre we know well.",8,2,8,8 November 2016
The Big Short," We never learn!
","Adam McKay (Writer, Director, Actor and part of the team behind 'Funny or Die') tackles the complicated retelling of the credit and housing bubble crash of the mid 2000's through the eyes of quirky hedge fund manager/mathematic Michael Burry (Christian Bale), FrontPoint Partner Mark Baum/Steve Eisman (Steve Carell), Deutsche Bank investor Jared Vennett/Greg Lippman (Ryan Gosling) and Cornwall Capital partner Ben Ricket/Ben Hockett (Brad Pitt), all big and small plays who along with their varied partners saw where the banks were heading. Note: Based on real characters, only Bale's character's name is actually used in the film. While it's evident the banking community has not learned from their mistakes, the film does brings into perspective what the banking system was/is doing, why the collapse occurred and what a few people saw and tried to do before and after the world came crashing down. McKay has gathered another one of 2015's great ensembles, with awards recognition talk for all involved. However, Bale's quirky and old ball character is the stand out here. Your head may be spinning from all the financial lingo tossed around in this film, but McKay (through the use of several terrific camera appearance explanations) does his best to put things into laymen terms. 'The Big Short' is an engrossing film, bringing to light a terrible time in our recent financial history.",9,8,13,2 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force put me to sleep
","Director J.J. Abrams ('Lost,' 'Star Trek Into Darkness,' 'Mission: Impossible III') steps into the future (again) to bring the latest of the Star Wars trilogy to the big screen. Not seeing any of the prior movies, I was poised and ready for an exciting film experience. Unfortunately, I feel asleep twice due to boredom. Sure, the spaceships are cool, the futuristic characters are interesting, and traveling through the galaxy looks like fun, but I've seen this all done before in any number of other space travel films/TV series. With something new to look for out of the question, I turned my attention to just enjoying the film for what it was and getting to know the characters. Unfortunately, the dialogue was so basic, I found it hard to stay interested. I was, however, amused to see Harrison Fords' character filled with so much dry-humor, and I now finally understand the attraction of the light-saber. Maybe if some new film technology had been introduced, the overall film would have meant more to this first timer. But, since that didn't happen, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' just bored me with its familiarity. One of the highlights of the film was to see Adam Driver ('GIRLS') step into such an iconic role within the film. Driver continues to be an interesting actor, and it's great to see him successful jump genres here. May the force be with those who love this trilogy!",6,7,12,2 January 2016
The Nice Guys," Nice and funny!
","Director Shane Black (Lethal Weapon and LW2) proves an action genre writer, given a good script and top actors, can bring life to a story surrounding a couple of bumbling private eyes (Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling). Set in the 1970's, the costumes (Kym Barrett) and environment (Danielle Berman, Richard Brigand and David Utlfey) provide Crowe and Gosling all the leeway they need to take their crazy loose cannon characters across the LA landscape in search of Amelia (Margaret Qualley - The Leftovers), with little Holly (Angourie Rice) as the grown-up of the trio. While initially hard to believe Crowe (with a mature body) and the sexy Gosling in such nutty roles, they quickly and easily pull you into their kooky topsy-turvy world, even when the storyline goes to far or gets off track. Matt Bomer (American Horror Story) gives a fun cameo, and Kim Basinger is a glow in her many soft-lit appearances. 'The Nice Guys' isn't brain surgery. However, it is filled with many good on liners, a fun script, great costumes, goofy best-bud-banter and a lot of heart.",8,3,7,9 June 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Both Garfield and Gibson could be a dark horses here for Lead Actor /Director recognition.
","Yup, Mel Gibson (the director) is back, as he presents the true story of Conscientious Objector WWII medic Desmond Doss (well acted by Andrew Garfield 'The Amazing Super-man' 2012), who served during the Battle of Okinawa without firing a shot and received the Medal of Honor. While the first part of the film is a bit of a cheesy set-up love story between Doss and Dorothy (Teresa Palmer 'Break Point' 2015), the actual story that follows, Gibson's final battle scene, the writing by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight, and the battle cinematography by Simon Duggan make the wait well worth the build-up. Unfortunately, Doss's reluctance to 'bear arms' gets lost in the initial love story, until it become evident that this is the reason for the story. It also doesn't help that Vince Vaughan ('The Break-up' 2006') is completely miscast as Doss' s loud and confrontational Sgt. Howell. Vaughn looks out of place in this role, in both his presence and dialogue delivery. The same goes for many of the interactions Doss endures with his fellow barrack-mates, and the under utilized Rachel Griffiths (Brothers & Sisters' 2006- 2011) as Doss's mom. However, just when all seems 'just another film,' the battle begins and the film turns into breathtaking greatness. Much like the initial scenes in 'Saving Private Ryan,' when the battle and struggle begins one can only hold on for the experience that is presented. Both Garfield and Gibson could be a dark horses here for Lead Actor /Director recognition. Mel Gibson is back, at least as a director, and you should get reacquainted with him here again.",8,2,5,4 December 2016
13 Hours," Wow!
","Director Michael Bay ('Transformers') rips reality from today's headlines presenting an in your face, behind-the-scenes look at the 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya that took the lives of US Ambassador Chris Stevens (Matt Letsher 'Scandal') and Sean Smith, along with the lives of other US soldiers and many Libyan rebels. 'Wow' is the word the comes to mind while both experiencing and then reflecting on the film. John Krasinski ('The Office') joins his fellow soldiers (James Badge Dale, Pablo Schreiber, David Denman 'Parenthood,' Dominic Fumusa 'Nurse Jackie,' and Max Martine) and others as they are charged with protecting their compounds and rescuing Stevens. Each actor, along with the always great-to-hate character actor David Costabile ('Suits'), are excellent in their respective gritty roles, with Krasinski successfully stepping outside of his 'The Office' role. Bay knows rock'm sock'm film making, and it all comes in handy here. Unfortunately, he is one of those directors who feels an up close, constantly moving camera is the best way to get his point across. Because of this style of filmmaking, much of the action is in blur. However, when he backs the camera away, allowing the audience to take in the surroundings, the result builds tension beyond belief. The 'Hillary' effect isn't addressed here, so no need to beat a dead horse. Realistic writing by Chuck Hogan, and screenplay by Mitchell Zuckoff, keep the audience glued to the screen, action and storyline. From the film, and what we know from the news, something went seriously wrong in the communication in Libya, forcing our soldiers to step up and do what they do best - survive! Don't miss this one!",9,9,20,20 January 2016
Alien: Covenant," No need to alienate yourself from this one
","Director Ridley Scott is no stranger to the 'Alien' series, as the original director of 'Alien'. So, one would think Covenant would be a familiar and exciting ride into outer space. Familiar it is, outstanding it's not. Following the 'it thing' in movies and TV, Michael Fassbender does a nice job as both Walter (the good) and David (the bad) robots who work along side a rather inept crew (Katherine Waterston 'Inherent Vice,'. Billy Crudup 'Jackie,' Danny McBride 'TV's Vice Principals,' Demian Bichir 'Weeds,' and Carmen Ejogo ' Selma' to name a few) charged with colonizing another plant with embryos. While exploring an unexplored land on the way to their mission, the Alien's birth and the excitement finally starts rolling. Lucky for that, because the first several minutes of Walter's dialogue with his father (Guy Pearce) is time consuming and unnecessary for the storyline, as is the cameo appearance of James Franco (Branson), the husband of one of the crew members. The good thing about this film is that, even if you 'been there, done that,' the film's outer limits cinematography and those pesky Aliens at least sustain one's interested. No need to alienate yourself from this one. The film is at least familiar and interesting.",7,14,29,31 May 2017
