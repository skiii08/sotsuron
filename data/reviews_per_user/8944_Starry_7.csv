Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great romp in fantasy
","This movie was everything I expected plus more. As a beginning of a saga, it had a lot to accomplish. It had to set the scene for what happens in 3 episodes time and it does that very well. In the back of my mind throughout the film was the knowledge of what is to come, but that didn't spoil the surprises. The special effect alone that have been packed into this movie make it a masterpiece. The story line, however, could have been developed a little more. I feel it was light-on and a little more background could have been given. The melding of computer technology with real-life actors was mostly smooth, but there were one or two sections where the artificial nature of the material was very evident. Overall, a great movie that leaves me salivating for the next two",9,0,0,4 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A rip-snorter
","At last George Lucas has regained his old form. This film leaves the Phantom Menace for dead! The action and underlying plot lines are excellent and it is great to see just why Master Yoda IS held in such high regard by other Jedi. In the theatre where I saw it (12:05 am on release day) the whole of the audience errupted in applause and cheers when Yoda 'Made his move!' I was a little worried about seeing this movie after the last one, butI am now awaiting the last in the series with anticipation.",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
Notting Hill," Hugh being Hugh
","A pretty pedestrian film where Hugh Grant plays himself---basically, as he always does, like 4 weddings, 9mths etc etc etc. Why must he type cast himself into a bumbling dickhead role like this all the time? I think the ladies will swoon over him and his body, but other than that, the film is oh so predictable and boring",3,1,3,16 June 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Win in a seemingly No-Win situation.
","Everyone has their own ideas about this story. We all havevisualized the Hobbits , Dwarves, wizards Orcs etc, so there was agood chance that Jackson would offend most of us some of thetime with his portrayal of the characters. Even given the sectionsleft out, I though he did a stirling job with this monumental task,and I think its a good job it was released after Harry Potter and thePhilosophers Stone, as that film would have seemed even moredisappointing if it was released later. I await with impatience therelease of film number two!",8,0,0,24 February 2002
Rules of Engagement," Disappointed with the ending
","I really enjoyed this film and thought that TLJ came throughwith a strong performance without having to be seen as amacho soldier. SLJ portrayed a career GI very well. However, I think that the tying-up of loose ends by textmessages at the end of the film was a cop out by the director. After building up a rage inside the mind of theaudience with the destruction of the tape, this should havebeen resolved in some way.",8,0,1,20 August 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," What a let down
","I am surprised that JK Rowling had anything to do with the filmingat all! Vital (SMALL) sections were left out, and the ending wascompletely altered for no apparent reason, other than an ego tripfor Warner Bros computer animation dept!  Whilst I enjoyedsections of the movie, I thought  Emma Watson II over-acted all thetime, whilst Daniel Radcliffe performed acceptably. To my way ofthinking, the pick of the actors was Rupert Grint as Ron. Hedemonstrated superb timing and had an easy way of acting. AlanRickman as Snape was a good choice, but once again, WBroshad to add a nice little line wishing Potter good luck in theQuiddich match!! TOTALLY out of character and unnecessary. Warner Bros had a wonderful opportunity to create a masterpiece,but they stuffed it up!",5,0,1,24 February 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Everything I expected
","This was a great sequel to a great movie. For once, a movie that you have to THINK in.....drift off and you'll miss a critical bit of info.The film leaves us nicely poised for the 3rd part later in 2003......Can't wait.",10,0,0,23 May 2003
