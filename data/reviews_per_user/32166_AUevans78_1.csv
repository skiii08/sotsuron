The Blair Witch Project," Really Lame
",I've seen scarier stuff on Seasame Street.  (I can at least see The Count.) I was rooting for the inbred mountain people to kill these whiners so I could leave.  The dialogue wasn't scripted and so it came off as forced improvisation.  The only reason that this film made any money was that a bunch of city people don't know how hard it is to get lost in the woods. People also wanted to be into the whole 'trendy-indie' movie scene.,2,1,3,3 June 2003
