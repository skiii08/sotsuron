The Sound of Music," Always makes me weep
","This is by far my favorite movie of all times. I'm a sucker for all Rodgers & Hammerstein musicals, and this one is the best one of all. Perhaps because I was 8 years old when it came out in 1965. My uncle played viola for musicals and I saw it before, but I always loved this movie especially. Boy, did I have a crush on Julie Andrews! Then there's the fact that I come from a musical family, so the film's theme of music overcoming Nazi Germany was a very moving point.This is a children's, or 'family' movie. I am a believer that children need music education and a respect for traditional European music culture. There are many factors that work against children receiving such cultural exposure today: elimination of traditional music education in public schools, the synthesizer revolution taking over the music world causing kids to mess with danceable synth drum tracks instead of learning an orchestral instrument (which is more difficult), emergence of non-European cultures in America creating a resentment toward white-based traditional music education, Modern (atonal) artistic music asserting itself causing more resentment of traditional (usually Romantic based) European music education, the constant emergence of new styles of popular and artistic music causing less & less room for traditional music to hold its ground, etc. etc.I believe that this is a shame because there is a certain subtle appreciation for music that is instilled in people who are allowed exposure to Romantic Classical music. Of course, classic Broadway music owes much to such Romantic music. Nowhere is this more evident than in this film, which theme essentially asserts the importance of European classical music for children's education, and does so in a manner that makes such music education FUN! Julie Andrews style. Indeed, traditional music education techniques were being challenged at the time of the making of this musical (the emergence of 50s rock & roll). This appears to have been R & H's nostalgic statement for the cause of retaining the old musical values by way of revealing just how fun learning Solfege (Do-re-mi etc.) can be! That is, if you have a really cool governess to play games with in the gardens while you learn the tunes.God! I wish I could go back to those days!Read it & weep, baby.",10,1,7,23 April 2001
Sleepy Hollow," More ear to tradition might have made it a masterpiece, but wonderful film
","As a serious classical musician, I am an elitist. As a lover of old films and literature, not, but far from today's mainstream. That's why my opinion of this movie is different than most. Everbody talked about (and awarded) the art direction, visuals, style etc. But even though I was as mesmerized as anyone with how the film looked, how it looked wasn't what caused me to truly love this film, which I do.The reason is that looks aren't everything. That is, the director succeded excellently with the extremely stylish/satirical film, Edward Scissorshands; but when I heard Burton was making Sleepy Hallow I thought, Hmmmmm... here's going to be a challenge. For this is a classic 19th century horror tale, therefore traditional methods of approach and application are necessary to accomplish respect for the story and attitudes of the period. In fact, the real satire here is reading the opinions of idiots who went to see Scissorshands II and were disappointed, as if a director should stay true to a narrow form in order to please the narrowminded of his fans.This would be true if the director wasn't capable of broadening. But in Burton's case, he has proven himself quite capable of leaving the cult behind and achieving greater horizons. It's a matter of shedding one's stylistic trappings and allowing the rest of the crew, in this case the writers & actors, to shine. This was done and well to the director's credit.But, there were moments when it was questionable if this was going to be achieved. That's why I frown when repeatedly hearing of the perfect fog effects, set designs etc. We have to pay respect to the director's special talent, but in this film we should also pay respect to how the director has evolved. In Burton's case here, it is a losing of contemporary jadedness/cynicism and a converse gaining of respect for traditional drama, literature and humane optimism.We may wonder why the story was never before made in to a film? (perhaps it was, but never released) It certainly was worthy of the kind of treatment Yagher and Walker gave it here. On the other side of the muse, however, was a musical soundtrack that lacked the depth of earlier 20th century film compositions. Though Elfman is an extremely talented orchestral composer, one wishes for music more keenly related to Rachmaninoff's deeply subtle chromaticism, from which much of film music is derived. Indeed, the lack of a more deeply Hitchcockian psychological noir/drama is what keeps this film from reaching higher levels of dramatic quality.The result is a combination of all the beautiful visuals of modern cinematography with a somewhat overly fast moving old English/New England styled horror/mystery story. That said, the question remains: Do we get the wonderful romantic/optimistic/intelligent characters so necessary to this old genre? Yes, we do! But most importantly, do we get the 'feeling' that the detective is an intelligent hero such as Sherlock Holmes? Yes, again! Wonderfully cast, Depp draws us to his intelligence, human imperfections, rebellious/romantic verve, all the emotions that made the period such a wonderfully important time and place to be a scientific liberal, as in H.G. Wells, Thomas Huxley, Shaw etc. These names are from a later time, but that makes it even more exciting: In this story, Ichabod Crane is one of the first! For this was the dawn of the Romantic age, that spawned the great 19th century novel, the detective mystery, and of course Darwin. All of this is about to become the world while the superstition still haunted the age. It seems it was Crane's (Depp's) charge to lead in stamping out the old ignorance while bringing in the new intelligence. Meanwhile, it appears to have been Burton's job to constantly remind us that satanic evil persists; and all the while you're thinking, yes, those stick-like, black & white horror drawings of the period (the 'Dear Dead Days' stuff) is what I love most about Burton's visual personality.All of the great, intricate plotting of a classic mystery was utilized well and Crane/Depp became the kind of Sherlock Holmes detective hero that makes you want to see a sequel. I love the period, the detective mystery, the classic literature - but most of all I loved the scene when Crane says to Young Nesbath upon entering New York City (circa 1800) 'You'll get your bearings soon enough. All you need to remember is that the Bronx is up, the Battery is down, and home is THIS WAY.' That's the kind of hospitable homecoming we all need after a fortnight of head butchering.",Null,0,1,1 July 2000
The Red Violin," Insulting piece of capitalistic, antique collector-minded cow-dung
","SPOILERS I've read many reviews of this film, and it appears that most critics believe the film is about music. Allow me to correct them. One thing this movie definitely is not about, and that's music. Rather, this movie is about promoting the business of antique collecting. As such, it carries the mentality of collectors, a breed of human that sits around thinking about how much more fun life could be if an old object were to jump in monetary value. There doesn't exist a train of thought more thoroughly removed from purely musical thoughts. This is why a film like this, supposedly about the virtues of musicianship, is little more than a jumble of pretentious, lying crud.Let's take violins, for example. My uncle was a violinist/violist and he held high esteem for a finely crafted instrument. But he also owned enough honest musicianship to know that placing too much value on a fine instrument is a mistake. The greatest example of fine musicianship, as my musical elders would say, is when the musician can take a shabby instrument and make it sing. This is the sentiment of true musicianship that I'm talking about. The Red Violin makes no attempt to share this concept to its audience. Instead, it wants to sell the opposite concept, that musicians are shallow until their instruments, if they are finely made, save them from themselves and others. What a load of nonsense... we musicians say! But antique collectors, well they fully embrace such a concept, of course. Next stop: college music courses taught by antique collectors.Antique collectors value the objects of history more than history itself. This is demonstrated in this shallow film, which craps on four periods of history while upholding the present as better than the past. But the fact is, the present state of humanity is sickeningly capitalistic compared to the past. So the story's protagonist finds a way to pilfer an auction house of the filthy rich in order to give a young girl a priceless violin. Is this the best anyone can do to set the vicious world of capitalism right? It doesn't set the vicious world of capitalism right. Such an act in the real world of auctions for the filthy rich would cause these capitalists to be that much more annoyed at thieves, thus that much more viciously competitive. Lesson: burglary as rebellion against capitalism is a failed endeavor no matter how one attempts or perceives it.I give now a recounting of my experience watching this film, in the form of a plot summary:A virtuous, 17th century violin maker uses his dead wife's blood to coat one of his better instruments, making it special to both musicians AND antique collectors. God forbid they should make a movie about how musicians, but not antique collectors, favor a certain instrument, then learn through their pure musicianship that it's not the instrument that counts, but the musician who plays it. Then a sickly 18th century child is given scholarship but dies before he can use it. Wasn't  the old world dreadful? But the violin survives this encounter, metaphorically informing us that violins are stronger things than humans with natural music talent. Gag meÂ….But wait! Now we must endure a soap opera styled interpretation of musical life during the 19th century, when apparently talented musicians are so decadent that their musicianship suffers. It's a typical misrepresentation of the Romantic music culture, and entirely expected from the creative minds of 20th century capitalist bigots who think that their own century saves all. What they forget to include is the bona-fide fact that 19th century music is leagues more virtuous than any music ever created during the 20th century. Again the violin survives the musician, and now the nausea is causing the vomit to flow from my mouth. But they're not yet through with me.First I must endure more capitalistic rhetoric when, during the 20th century in China's cultural revolution, all non-nationalistic (decadent) music is forbidden. Now the virtuous musician must sacrifice their instrument or face violent persecution. It makes for a good bit of espionage, and I'd be the first to denounce such totalitarian atrocities. Only I'm aware by now that this story is meant to serve a purpose. That is, to show us that free capitalism is better than anti-art, totalitarian socialism. Hmm. Agreed, like the lesser of two evils.Again the violin survives the musician. Hey, this is some violin. It's indestructible! Finally, we reach the present age of technology, when real music has finally been completely obliterated by way of over analysis. A guy manages to burglarize an auction for the filthy rich, then plays Robin Hood and hands over the priceless violin to a musically aspiring young girl. Is there anything in the story explaining to us just how musically virtuous this girl is? Of course not, that's not necessary. Besides, such a digression would spoil the moments of deep sentimentality that all the would-be antique collectors in the audience are feeling towards this incredible violin. It's about the violin, you see, not musicians. If suddenly these fools in the audience were subjected to real music performance on the screen, their sensibilities would surely be twisted out of their comfortably shallow little places.The part of the story that I sorely missed, was what happens after the ending: A few years later the girl who'd been given the priceless violin decides to quit learning the instrument and listen to some Brittany Spears with her friends instead. Since otherwise she would certainly be considered a nerd freak by her schoolmates. One must have realistic priorities these days, hmm? Hence, this film is not about music. For currently music is at a very low rung on the average citizen's list of priorities. And this movie is, after all, for the people. Finally, I pass out from exhaustion. Thank god this horrible episode of my life is over.",Null,1,3,30 May 2002
The Iron Giant," An extraordinarily fine science fiction film hidden within children's animation fare - don't miss it!
","On The Iron Giant video box is an excerpt from The Tuscon Citizen movie reviewer: 'The best animated film of the decade...'. I wholeheartedly agree. Problem is, why doesn't the rest of America? The film apparently grossed one sixth of Toy Story's gross and, as a more expensive film than Toy Story, its profits amount to far less than its cost to make - i.e. it lost money.This film's lack of popularity is the same as the lack of popularity of Columbia Tristar's Indian in the Cupboard. The underlying cause of this is found in the fact that, unlike Toy Story, Star Wars etc., Iron Giant and Indian In the Cupboard are films with more intelligence than pizzazz, consequently causing the mainstream public to not be as interested in patronizing them into blockbusters. Neither film is difficult for any child over the age of 5 to understand. It's just that films that are even the least bit intelligent cause them to achieve the IQ of a book, and that translates to box office failure. Never mind that The Iron Giant is in a league of the greatest films ever made; it's just not cute or cool enough for profitable merchandising.Within this fact lies the nutshell of the problem with American entertainment. That is, basically there's not enough respect for intelligence. The film industry is not to be entirely blamed, however, like junk food chains are not entirely responsible for American obesity. For if the people are too stupid to know what's good for them, one may rest assured that someone will come along selling what's bad for them, and they will promptly eat it up. America is Pinocchio and certain of Hollywood's producers are the sly fox & company who lead Pinocchio to the children's prison hiding behind a carnival front. But the Iron Giant - he thinks he's Superman, and he really is this time. That is, his movie is really a saving grace in a tide of less intelligent fare. In terms of Pinocchio, this 100 foot robot is America's fairy queen.That said, I should say what's so good about this film. Problem is, there's so much that I don't know where to begin. This is one of those animation films, like Cats Don't Dance, that uses animation's strengths - such as that it doesn't have to rely on live actors, sets, lighting etc. - to its greatest potential. There isn't a single second of dead space in the entire film. Moreover, the script is impeccable and, as the opening page reviewer eloquently stated (read it; it's a fine, poignant review), what's left out of the story line is a boon for the audience's imagination. This only works if the script is good & adequately performed. It is, with exceptional attention payed to timing and witty dramatic effects. Not special effects, mind you - this is animation, and it doesn't need those. I'm talking dramatic effects, such as hints at plot twists, perfectly hip slapstick set-ups that aren't dumb & dumber like so many Jim Carrey bits, intelligent jokes & asides on religion, morality, nationalism, the beatnik culture, the science fiction comic strip genre so popular in the 50s (which is the setting for the movie), and many characterizations, all perfectly realized and all of which entertain & bring the audience into the action and keep us happily interested and wondering what's next. This is a definition of fine drama; it works in any of the dramatic genres, and it is undeniably what every intelligent human being desires from dramatic entertainment. In my humble opinion, the producers of this film thus understand the most basic, important elements of drama, and are therefore rare geniuses of dramatic production, on the level with Shakespeare, Rogers & Hart, you name it; even the music was as finely orchestrated and whimsically placed in cues as Bernstein, Copland & Stravinsky would have accomplished.Indeed, everything in this film was better than anything one should have expected from a children's animation feature. This apparent mis-match was surely its death warrant at the box office. But once again, time will reveal the true genius from the flash in the pan. The Iron Giant is a supreme classic, the product of film making geniuses. Its sentimentality made me cry, its fable made me rejoice, its subtle slapstick left me grinning and, perhaps most importantly, it allowed me to attend a film, and later many video replays, with my young son without having to feel that I was taking my son to some tawdry carnival that would lower his intelligence & impress upon him low expectations of humanity. If all American children's films were this good, America would truly be the great nation it is cracked up to be.",Null,0,1,11 August 2000
Mr. Holland's Opus," Made to benefit serious musicians, Mr. Holland's Opus does this, but at the expense of including any artistic music in the film
","Artistic composer Glenn Holland says: `I don't wanna be a studio musician.' Though it was 5 years ago, I still remember that I was the only person in the theater who laughed at this line. Why is it funny? Imagine a trained Shakespearian actor auditioning for Scooby Doo voice-overs. This is the sentiment behind Holland's subtly sardonic line. Though Opus tries to be serious concerning the struggles of America's artistic musicians, its lack of musical authenticity (the lack of truly artistic music within it) directs its voice towards non-musicians. This may well have been deliberate since much of the funding for musical art must come from such lay people. The underlying issue, however, reveals the fact that most Americans clearly are not in the least bit interested in serious music nor traditional (classical) music education. Most Americans prefer non-serious music.Nevertheless, Opus was made by producers who apparently wish to use the film's melodramatic chutzpah to interest the nation in music education & its funding needs. There is irony in the fact that many of today's popular music artists are much less musically devoted than they are well versed in the business of music. Here is where music entertainment, not music art, is revealed as America's predominant music culture. Aside from the line above, the film doesn't address this issue. What it does address is the related issue of public school music education. It is related because many of America's artistic musicians make their livings as music educators.There are reviewers below who disliked Opus while others are perplexed since they liked the film. The latter are correct; there is nothing wrong with a melodramatic film that is more melodramatic than it is faithful to musical ideology. But the fact that this melodramatic film with little insight into serious educational music was made into a political statement in defense of our nation's music education causes some of the musically faithful to call 'foul.'  Those offended are apparently unaware of the misrepresentation sometimes necessary in political attempts to influence people who need to be pushed into helping the needy & high minded.Everything about Opus is like a liberal campaign with the best of intentions & the ability to connive its way into the hearts of taxpaying citizens. The film was made not by devoted artistic/educational musicians but by experienced film businessmen. These entertainment industry men hired The Seattle Symphony Orchestra & The Young Musicians Foundation Orchestra so as obviously to make themselves appear affiliated with artistic and educational music culture. The film was ostensibly about a frustrated, unemployed music composer, but all of the actual music in the film was composed by a successful music businessman whose achievements include the 'Die Hard' film soundtracks. A few die-hard purist musicians get upset (reviews below) over these inconsistencies. Yet the more upset they get, the more they may be biting the hands that are attempting to feed them.As I watched Dreyfuss making his speech on music education at the Oscars, I thought: That's an actor. What does he know about music? I had the same thoughts as I watched this film. This is the problem with being a musician who likes films. It's like being an astrophysicist trying to appreciate Star Wars.Clearly, Opus is not a film easily digested by us serious musicians, despite the fact that its political aspirations are an attempt to aid us. The ironies abound in this situation. Such musicians are apt to disagree with its tagline: `It's not about the direction you take. It's about the direction you give.' It's the individualism found amongst serious classical music composers that is at odds with this very American morale. Couple this dispute with our current 'we' generation, its distaste for egocentricity, and we find such serious composers veritable outsiders, indeed degenerates, in the opinions of mainstream Americans. It is not a pretty place to live, and the first few scenes of Opus illustrate this hardship. Holland also said: 'I don't wanna be a music teacher,' but he became one and in the end the community said 'no thanks, we don't want a music teacher.' Pretty tough stuff.For the political campaign to aid artistic & educational music, by all means see this film & afterwards contribute what you can to the cause. However, for real artistic & educational music, I recommend 'Leonard Bernstein's Young People's Concerts' & other such videos containing real artistic & educational music, many of which may be found listed here at IMDb.",Null,2,4,25 July 2000
The Matrix," Almost as good as a Science Fiction book
","Two things went through my mind as I watched this film (which I have seen thrice, and would happily see it again). One: This is a quality science fiction story. Two: Will the style and violence overwhelm the story? - as too often occurs with potentially great sci-fi films inevitably by way of cheap scriptwriting. It is the nature of blockbuster type Hollywood films to screw up a good sci-fi thing by allowing the action to prioritize-to-death the story. As one might expect from an action film featuring Keanu Reeves, the dialogue tends toward the short-witted and stylish and there is plenty of gratuitous violence. But Hollywood has recently been on to this valid criticism of itself, and it appears to have been making some progress in this area.Matrix is an example of producers with an ear to those of us who want more than just ignorant dialogue and fast, violent action from our science fiction films. On one hand, they have basically a stylized kung-fu flick with an African-American heavily supporting a white lead, lots of black leather and overcoats, guns, action, state-of-the-art effects, futuristic 'space'ships etc. On the other, they have a sci-fi story that at first sounds typical but then unfolds into a well crafted tour of a potential futuristic human existence visualized through the context of what currently stands as cutting edge technology (virtual reality). This makes the idea 'hard' science fiction, as in Arthur Clarke's Odyssey novels/films which used NASA technology as their premise. There is also a biblical slant to the plot and names of characters and props.If I was to be picky, I might say that less gratuitous violence in exchange for more plot discerning dialogue would have improved the film. It would have made it more like a sci-fi book. But maybe I should just go and read the book for that (most blockbuster films nowadays have a book released along with them - Star Wars has several). Anyway, I hope there is a good book made from this story, because I would read it as avidly as any favorite sci-fi novel: the plot idea is that good. Incidentally, the sequels to this film, typically are trash in comparison to the original. Very much disappointed, I had to realize that the producers/director were far more involved in the stylization and special effects than the plot. Too bad.On the other hand, finding time to read books is becoming increasingly difficult these days, which says a lot in relation to the moral within Matrix. Which leads us to the duality present in a moral film such as Matrix: Should we watch it again and forget about the world's problems, or think twice and do something to improve our society, to increase our independence and freedom? In the end, we may be victims of our own device, for we seek entertainment to help us forget about the drudgery of our lives. Our man-made systems, systems that were originally created to enhance independence from menial labor, may be creating a new form of slavery.It's a creepy thought. But maybe it's just fantasy. Maybe Matrix is just an entertaining movie. Despite its inherent short-witted weaknesses, its clichÃ©d fashion statements, I was thoroughly entertained. It says something about me and the kind of viewers that like this stuff. We are dreamers more than we are fixers and doers. Our detractors, the fixers and doers who come out on this forum to criticize us, are probably right that we should be spending more of our time servicing our society. But then, that wouldn't be freedom for us, would it?",Null,0,0,17 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Our generation's Flash Gordon; this, the 1st film of the saga, is still the best one
","Star Wars, now one of our classic science-fantasy melodramas, having been criticized for some valid reasons (too much tawdry merchandising) also takes a lot of unnecessary flack from critics who fail to recognize that they are criticizing elements inherent to the adventure-melodrama. Probably the most significant feature of this film, Lucas' great space-fantasy epic, is that it gave baby-boomers & later generations a chance to have our very own Flash Gordon styled film series. To understand the quality of episodic, Wagnerian opera and to realize how rarely this excellent dramatic form has been attempted through the last 12 decades, is to begin to understand the value of this gift. There are obvious similarities, such as how the musical themes are boldly attached to the characters' entrances. But a lesser recognized relation between Wagnerian opera and adventure-melodrama films is the simple-minded character studies (i.e. under-developed characters) and the accompanying simple-minded sentimentality that in both genres is enhanced by highly sentimental music.The extreme popularity of such films as the Flash Gordon and Star Wars series is manifest in how melodramatic & otherwise sentimental scenes are utilized effectively within an adventurous environment. This reveals an improtant psychological factor in popular adventure films: melodrama & its inherent sentimentality sells. This fact may appear to be at odds with the current 'tough love' styled psychological climate & the hard-edged adventure films that are currently popular. Nevertheless, sentimentality is integral to many films as it enhances emotional elements. It should not be underestimated. Some commented that Star Wars is nothing more than a kid's movie. Well, maybe it's time we grown-ups took a lesson from the little folks.Star Wars is a veritable test of the filmgoing public's ability to innocently appreciate a movie, to play dumb and allow ourselves to re-experience the awe that is missing in today's jaded environment. All four films of the saga so far have equally tempted us to experience this element of human frailty so necessary in retaining our humaneness. And of course, many viewers have passed these tests with flying colors. But this original Star Wars film is by far the most operatic in style, thus it is the most innocent & sentimental. This stands to reason - the relative innocence of the film makers & their corporations before high success set in, less merchandising chutzpah intimidating the magic etc.Though all four films have marvelous Wagnerian styled operatic music, with John Williams' themes playing timely and subtly upon each character's entrance etc., this first film introduces the characters' musical themes most dramatically and with the most sentimentality. The Princess's theme, Luke's theme, Obi-Wan Kenobi's theme, the theme of the Force are all extremely sentimental and moving, while the Empire's theme is dastardly and ominous. These musical elements, and other dramatic elements, are what serve to make this one of the most innocently sentimental films in the last 30 years. This sentimentality supersedes any dramatic weakpoints in the film, and there are many, at least as many as one may easily find in earlier melodramas. But it's the audience's responsibility, while viewing a melodrama, to overlook them and groove on the simple, sentimental moment at hand. Critics that overlook this point are foolish, indeed.If, however, the viewer is having difficulty finding the warm sentiment in such melodramatic entertainment, I might offer a bit of advice on locating one's inner sentimentality. That is, perhaps the viewer might try to reach inside and find a place of vulnerable frailty. For example, as a person who lost his father at a young age, I am susceptible to warm father figures on film, such as Robert Young in TVs 'Father Knows Best' & Hugh Beaumont in 'Leave it to Beaver.' That's why Alec Guinness, who plays Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi, is my favorite part. I have a young son and have therefore watched Star Wars dozens of times on our VCR, not to mention the several times I saw it in the theater when I was 21 years old. But I could watch this movie a thousand times, and each & every time I would get choked up, as I still do, over the Ben Kenobi scenes.",Null,0,0,18 July 2000
