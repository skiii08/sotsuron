The Blair Witch Project," One of the most original ideas ever used in a motion picture.Chilling.
","I remember being afraid to enter the cellar at all hours.I was afraid to enter a dark room and I was afraid to enter anyplace that represented darkness.I was afraid because I did not know what was beyond that darkness.So what a chilling experience it was for me when I viewed 'The Blair Witch Project'.In actuality,'The Evil Dead' which was also set in the woods,did a much better job at scaring me as well as this film did.They are both great horror films that deal with the unknown. What remained so eerie about this film is that we are never allowed to remind ourselves that this is only a movie.It works because there are no special effects,big stars or a man running around with a machete wearing a hockey mask.'The Blair Witch Project' is the kind of horror movie that I would probably watch once every Halloween.Do I think 'The Blair Witch Project' is one of the scariest films ever made.Yes,I do.I don't think it's scary enough to freak us out.'The Exorcist' did a better job at that.'The Blair Witch Project' is worth being called one of the scariest films ever made because in my opinion,the unknown can be a frightening subject and that is what 'The Blair Witch Project' is all about.",10,2,3,15 December 2000
Requiem for a Dream," Strange,disturbing and bizarre.A great performance by Ellen Burstyn.****
","Darron Aronofsky,the director who gave us 'Pi',enters us into a world of hallucinatory images and nightmarish visions seen through the eyes of four people who spend their time in a world where everything seems like a hellish experience.'Requeim for a Dream' is simply a disturbing,bizarre film,but a great one that relies on making the viewer feeling a little uncomfortable due to it's tremendous scenes of drug use and the situations each of the characters are going through.I liked 'Requeim for a Dream' because it is very serious and doesn't give the viewer a chance to relieve him or herself from the disturbance that is displayed on the screen.The highlight for this film is Ellen Burstyn's terrific Academy Award nominated performance in the film.Even though,I thought 'Requeim for a Dream' was one of the best films of 2000,I think 'Traffic' scores on a higher scale.After watching this film,I think Ellen Burstyn should have won for Best Actress instead of Julia Roberts for 'Erin Brokovich',which I believe she also deserved.'Requeim for a Dream' can be a disturbing trip,but the trip is worth taking.",Null,0,1,10 October 2001
The Ring," Pretty good film.But I was expecting more. * * * 1/2
","'The Ring' suffers from only one thing:The hype going on around it.Here is a film that is being called the scariest film of the year and even though they were some elements that I thought were scary,the rest of the film had me wanting more.I have to admit that even though I wanted more of the scares that I expected,the film was still enjoyable.'The Ring' is an interesting story and although the story is not original,I still found it to be interesting to watch.In the film,a woman investigates the mysterious deaths of people who have died after watching a videocassette that contains disturbing images.These people die seven days after watching the tape.One of the things I expected was a Blair Witch feel to it.I did not get that.What I did get in the scenes that did not scare me was an interesting film with disturbing images that I thought were subtle but disturbing.I don't think 'The Ring' is the scariest film of the year.I do think it's a good film to make the time go by.'Signs' in my opinion has to be the scariest film I saw so far this year.While each of those films deal with an unatural force,I wasn't frightened that much by 'The Ring'.But I was thrilled.",Null,0,0,2 November 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial' * * * * *
","I am sitting by a computer at this exact time trying to figure out what words to put into this review on 'E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial'.This film is definitely a treasure to behold and a wonderful imaginative masterpiece from Steven Spielberg.Spielberg seems to guide the audience through a magical journey dealing with lonliness and friendship that rightfully makes this one of the greatest motion pictures that I have ever seen.Alot of what comes from this film is what we imagined and went through as a kid.'E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial' was released on June 11,1982 when I was ten years old.It was a time when I spent my days fantasizing about the films of 'Star Wars' which also had a huge impact on me.Watching this film,I found that this film never gets tiring.It never loses its charm.Technicly,storywise and characterwise,director Steven Spielberg's film is such a great film that I think it's also one of the most important.The film won four Academy Awards.But not one of those categories were in the major categories.When 'Ghandhi' beat 'E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial' for Best Picture,that had to be one of the biggest upsets in Oscar history.While 'Ghandhi' was a three hour plus film that dealt with the power of one man,'E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial' was a film that asked us to enjoy ourselves and have a good time while we watch the film.The visual effects,which won the Academy Award,was impressive and still is today.But I have to admit that the award should have gone to 'Blade Runner' because of it's amazing futuristic images.Nevertheless,the effects are a sight to stare and adds more imagination to the viewer.'E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial' came into our lives 20 years ago.For that amount of time,moviegoers were treated with a rare classic that stands the test of time.'E.T.:The Extra Terrestrial' is a film that I hail as one of Steven Spielberg's greatest and will never lose its place in cinematic history.",Null,0,1,28 October 2002
Minority Report," One of the best films of the year.* * * * *
","No one knows what the future is going to be like.We know the past and the present .But we will never know what the future will bring.To bring the future to us,we have to go deep in our heads and search.'Minority Report' is a film that does that.Steven Spielberg,who amazed me last year with 'A.I.:Artificial Intelligence' does it again with this film about a pre-crime unit that prevents a crime from happening before it happens using three psychics.This has to be one of the most involving,exciting films I have seen in years.Tom Cruise is the head of the pre-crime unit who is framed for a crime he is supposedly about to commit.Everything about this film is full of energy and great CGI visual effects which I think is very appropriate.Steven Spielberg is one of the most imaginative filmmakers in film history.Watching 'Minority Report',I felt like I was hypnotized and sent to another world.'Minority Report' is a film that provides plenty of fun.Steven Spielberg has made alot of great films and this film will be added to my list as one of them.",Null,0,0,26 June 2002
Hostel," The movie dragged on.*
","The only way you'll enjoy 'Hostel' is if you rent the DVD,fast forward it to the second half,and watch it from there.The film is as graphic and disturbing as they say it is and blood and gore fans will find a taste for it.That's only if they're able to sit through about an hour of character development and plot setting which has not been surrounded by any suspense.Sure,there is the nudity but I didn't really care.This is sad because director Eli Roth,who directed 'Cabin Fever'(Which I thought was superior.)seems to have a taste for horror films but he fails to use it in this film.Although,the film is not that bad,I felt pretty much angered by the fact that I got less of what I wanted.'Hostel'.It's not one of the best or one of the worst.But some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of waiting and the lack of suspense.",Null,0,0,12 January 2006
The Fifth Element," Mindblowing and spectacular.The visual effects are out of this world.
","'The Fifth Element' is a mindblowing,sci-fi,action/adventure film set in the future that has every element of a fun movie.Bruce Willis  stars as a Brooklyn,New York cab driver who discovers that the world is bent on total destruction.So he must team up with a mysterious,beautiful woman played by Mila Jovavich who is the key to saving the planet.Visualy stunning,with superb production design and a Terrific performance by Bruce Willis and Gary Oldman,'The Fifth Element' is a fun film that is also raised to a more humorous level by Chris Tucker,who steals the show along with the film's visual effects.The fact that the Academy Awards chose to ignore the art direction,costume design,makeup and visual effects make me wonder if sometimes if the academy has any good taste.Bruce Willis,popular for the Die Hard films,shows that he has a lighter side to himself in this movie.'The Fifth Element' is a visual feast for the eyes and to me is considered one of the best science fiction movies of all time.",10,0,1,27 December 2000
Blade," Dark and fun.One of the best comic strip adaptations since 'The Crow'.
","'Blade',which is based on the Marvel comics,is a dazzling display of martial arts action and darkness which blows up on the screen.Wesley Snipes is probably the toughest superhero since Dolph Lundgren in 'The Punisher'.Although that film wasn't all that good compared to this one.Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff battle each other with the forces of good and evil while Kriss Kristofferson,who is Blade's mentor,throws a great supporting performance.His role may have not been worthy of an academy award nomination.But I can't picture anyone else but Kriss playing the role of Whistler,Blade's mentor.N'Bush Wright is lovely as Karen.The production design and makeup showcase everything that this movie stands for.And the martial arts scenes by Wesley Snipes are a knock out.'Blade'which is equipped with a great plot and screenplay is full of energy.Better than those other comic strip adaptations like 'Steel' with Shaquille O'Neil.Good thing he didn't play Blade.Blade is truly entertaining.",7,0,1,5 December 2000
The Others," The most fun I ever had being scared.
","'The Others' is a movie about a haunted house.It's all we need to know about this film.Comparing this to other films of its kind,'The Others' has the kind of jump out of your seat scenes that had me squeezing the seat and blocking my eyes at sometime during parts of the movie.To explain the twist at the end of the film would only add insult to those who haven't seen the film.It's a frightfest that even though I have seen films that are more scarier,made me appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to achieve.Nicole kidman is brilliant as the main character in the film.The film's ability to have me jump out of my seat a dozen times making me feel that I was a seven year old watching a scary movie is the reason why 'The Others' is a such a great film.I would recommend it.",8,0,0,15 August 2001
X-Men," The best since 'Batman'.
","'X-Men' is a delight to watch.The entire film which is based on the Marval Comics is in my opinion the third best film behind films such as 'Superman:The Movie' and 'Batman'.Adapting comic book characters can have it's rewards and it's dissapointments.'Captain America' and 'The Punisher' bombed and was hardly released.'The Fantastic Four' was one adaptation that suffered so badly that it wasn't even released,theatrically or direct to video.'X-Men' which is directed by Bryan Singer has the best cast that you could ask for.Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as Professor X were both good in the film.Ian Mckellen was awesome as Magneto.Halle Berry was pretty cool as Storm and James Mardsen is the right choice for Cyclops.Let's not forget about Anna Paquin as Rogue and the beautiful Famke Jansenn as Dr.Jean Grey.'X-Men' is the movie to see.",7,0,0,23 November 2000
The Terminator," Reinvented the sci-fi genre.It would be a shame if this film was never seen.
","'The Terminator' is one of those science fiction films that represent the ultimate in cinematic experience.It made Arnold Schwarzenegger a star,yes and it also took us into a futuristic society that had me asking so many questions about technology.'The Terminator' is the kind of film I grew to watch as a kid on home video over a number of times,eventually leading me to realize that this film is actually one of the most smartest science fiction films ever made.It's not just science,but it's also an action packed event which director James Cameron successfully entertained the viewers with.'Terminator 2:Judgment Day' was a better movie which doese not mean I think any less of this film.'The Terminator' shouldn't be missed and I really think that it has a place as the most important science fiction film ever made.",7,2,5,6 August 2001
Blade II," 'Blade II' * * * *
",'Blade II' is a superior continuation to the 1998 hit that reunites Wesley Snipes as the dark comic book superhero who continues his spree of taking on vampires.The first 'Blade' was one hell of a film and this one is even better.The sequel is directed by Guilermo Del Toro and centers on Blade teaming up with a group of vampires to destroy a race of mutant vampires which are indestructible against Blade's weaponry.Del Toro takes 'Blade II' to a higher exciting action level and Wesley Snipes is fiercely entertaining and gives the audience what they paid for.The martial arts sequences were cheorographed by Donnie Yen who also plays one of the vampires who is a member of Blade's team.I have this film twice already and I plan on seeing it again and again.I would highly recommend this film if you are really into films like this.,8,0,1,26 March 2002
Alien," The best of the 'Alien' series.* * * * *
","'Alien' is a dark tour of suspense and terror which grabs ahold of the viewer,wrapping that viewer with elements of simplifying atmosphere of sci-fi terror.It's a film that has elements of darkness,making us feel vulnerable at times.The highpoint of this film is that it still stands towering above it's three sequels and it's imitators.I enjoyed all four 'Alien' films. What makes this film such a classic is the way director Ridley Scott puts characters into certain situations that makes us feel vulnerable.The trailer for the film,the narrator says,'In space,no one can hear you scream'.Ridley Scott reminds us that we are really in space and that in space there is no escape from terror.'Alien' is the kind of sci-fi,horror film that set the standard for films today like'Event Horizon',although that was a supernatural film,it was still set on a spaceship.This film is a truly a classic for it's kind and the visual effects are tremendously spectacular.'Alien' is the real classic of sci-fi horror films.",10,0,1,4 October 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," 'Star Wars:Episode II:Attack of the Clones' * * *1/2

'Star Wars:Episode II-Attack of the Clones' is a visually story telling film in which the story is told through it's visual effects.The first three films in the 'Star Wars' trilogy were more better because the story telling was told not just in it's effects but within the story itself.Director George Lucas takes an approach to telling the origin of Darth Vader who was once Anakin Skywalker.I have to admit that Episodes I-II are going downhill a bit but at the same time,keeps me entertained and amused.With 'Star Wars:Episode III' being ready for principal photography in 2003 for a Summer,2005 release date,it woulds seem possible,hopefully to have the original 'Star Wars' premiere on DVD.",Null,0,1,21 May 2002

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," This review is for the DVD edition,which I highly recommend.
","'Terminator 2:Judgment Day' was released at a time when movies were entering a new phase of technology.During my nineteenth year of my life and my fourteenth year of going to the movies,it was apparent that I had seen every movie that blew me away.The last time I had seen a film that blew me away before 'Terminator 2:Judgment Day' was back in 1977.That film was 'Star Wars' which changed all the rules in terms of visual effects.The art of visual effects would never be the same.At least that what I thought before I saw 'Terminator 2:Judgment Day'.I am not saying that 'Terminator 2:Judgent Day' is far better than 'Star Wars'.'Star Wars' is a classic in it' own right.But as the decade of the nineteen nineties was coming to an end,'Terminator 2:Judgment Day' was too becoming a classic in it's own right.'The original Terminator movie was the kind of movie that dealt with the apocalypse and so did this sequel.Much of the cast and crew from 'The Terminator' returned to make this box office smash which took six months to shoot.The fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger returned as the good guy came as a surprise to me.Linda Hamilton who reprised her role as Sarah Connor was more dramatic than ever.The sequel blew away 'The Terminator' and blew away the special effects in 'Star Wars'.But The effects in 'Star Wars' are still considered one of the best in cinematic history.I don't think that the filmmakers of 'Terminator 2:Judgment Day' meant to outdo 'Star Wars'.They're both great films that deserved to recognized not just for their acheivements in special effects.But for their story.About ten years later(Well,almost)I rented the DVD edition of 'Terminator 2:Judgment Day' which was pretty much more better than the theatrical version due to the fifeteen or twenty minutes of added footage that was added to this film.To tell you what these scenes were would not be right because because from what I figured,why spoil a movie.The DVD offers plenty of added fun material that explains about the production of the film.'Terminator 2:Judgment Day' is also the one film I remember because of the villain played by Robert Patrick who could send a message to his victims with his cold stare.'Terminator2:Judgment Day' was really great when it came out in theaters.But the DVD edition is far more superior in every detail.James Cameron who directed this film and who won the academy award for Best Director for 'Titanic' has worked with Arnold Schwarzenneger on other films such as 'True Lies' and they make a great team which is a shame that James Cameron will not be directing 'Terminator 3'.Word has it that John McTeirnan who made such films as 'Predator' and Die Hard' is directing.In 'The Terminator',when Arnold said 'I'll be Back',that's what he meant.In 'Terminator 2:Judgment Day',he kept his promise.This film delivers all the goods and it was the most fun I ever had watching a film.Rent the ultimate edition DVD.I highly recommend it in every way.",10,1,1,12 December 2000
Spider-Man," Probably the best comic book adaptation since 'Superman:The Movie' * * * * *
","'Spider-Man' is probably the most entertaining film that I have seen for the Summer holiday movie season.I like to look at it as the film that would knock 'X-Men' off the ground.'X-Men' was entertaining also and I also enjoyed it for its style and action.But 'Spider-Man' has so much humor and it also does a good job explaining Spider-Man's origin.The film was nearly made a decade ago by James Cameron.But there was some trouble with some legal issues.There was no telling what James Cameron's vision of 'Spider-Man' would have been like.The character has been around for fourty years and has been featured in comics and even had its own television show by CBS.That show was campy and wasn't even exciting.Only an eight year old would enjoy it.The theatrical version of 'Spider-Man' is fun for everyone and is alot more faithful to the comic than the television show.Among the film's highlights are its cast.Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker and Spider-Man.Among the other actors who were up for the role was Freddie Prinze,Jr,Heath Ledger and James Franco who played James Dean in 'James Dean'.The filmmakers chose Tobey Maguire which I think is the best casting for this film since Christopher Reeve for his 'Superman' films.Tobey is just right for the role and provides alot of humor throughout the film.I don't think anyone else would have been great for the role of The Green Goblin but Willem Dafoe.He doesn't play The Green Goblin.He is The Green Goblin.His performance reminds me of Jack Nicholson's performance of The Joker in 'Batman'.The film also is delivered the goods with its casting of Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.

","There is no questioning about it.No ifs ands or buts.This film belongs in horror film history.I first experienced a scene from this film back around nineteen seventy nine.That scene terrified me.Twenty years it took me to watch this film straight through without blocking my eyes.I have no trouble watching the film now.But I still think of this film as the scariest in film history.We all know what the film is about and we all seen it a thousand times over the past thirty years.Copied by other films such as 'Beyond the Door' and the awful 'The Antichrist','The Exorcist' has not lost its power to shock due to the cinematography.Its documentary film style seems to add a sense of realism to the film.The special effects are as unique now as they were around thirty years ago.This is the ultimate in cinematic horror.Director William Friedkin's power is that once he goes to far,he doesn't stop.He keeps going.The film is also effective because we get to know the characters rather than go straight to the scares.'The Exorcist' begins as a humanizing experience and then we are lured into a nightmarish experience.It's kind of like the film is happening to us.There is no mistake about this film.'The Exorcist' pulls no punches and may victimize some film goers.A horror film is a horror film.'The Exorcist' is not only a horror film.It is a reminder to us all of what fear means to us.A classic in the horror genre,'The Exorcist' doesn't just frighten,it disturbs on a high level.I respect this film and still believe this to be the scariest film ever made.Perhaps more frightening then I can imagine.",10,2,3,4 November 2006

2001: A Space Odyssey," Stanley Kubrick's best film. * * * * *
","'2001:A Space Odyssey' is slow.It is visually awe inspiring.There is a reason I believe that director Stanley Kubrick made the film at such a slow pace.The sequences in which we see the spaceships travel at such a slow speed is probably Stanley Kubrick's way of telling us that we should look at this film without rushing through it.'Star Wars' was better in terms of its excitement.'2001' was better in terms of its beauty and mysteriosness. I would consider this the best sci-fi film of all time.Stanley Kubrick's visionis wonderful and still holds up until this very day.I wasn't born in the 1960s and I really don't watch all of his films.I have seen 'Paths of Glory','The Shining' and 'Eyes Wide Shut'.Not to mention a few others.'2001:A Space Odyssey' is a film that I could probably relate to.After watching this film,I feel compelled to watch it again.It deserves to be seen again.A classic.",8,0,2,14 June 2002
Avatar," A breakthrough in filmmaking.
","The last time we had a film that broke through moviegoers in terms of what was visual and what effected us was 'Star Wars' back in 1977. Now,many years later, James Cameron has brought a film to the screen that serves its' purpose to moviegoers in such a way, I should say the art of film has started all over again.Technology isn't the only reason why 'Avatar' will stand out as a classic. You may disagree with me if you want. Thats alright with me. All I am saying is that 'Avatar' delivers what I think is new in the process in the art of filmmaking. It's going to happen. Every several years, there is bound to be a film that teaches us how we should feel about how film should work. 'Avatar', technically and emotionally, is one of those films that accomplishes that in every way that I have seen. As I was watching 'Avatar', my thoughts and focus weren't just on the visual effects although the visual effects were tremendously spectacular in every way. It received a well deserved Academy Award for it's effects and none of these effects could not be done several years ago.Now, with the proper technology, It seems that the art of filmmaking has evolved. 'Avatar' is one of those films that belongs in the evolutionary process. I am going to be truthful here. The one film that will knock 'Avatar' off the map is '2001: A Space Odyssey' which came out in 1968. Just because 'Avatar' is not really on top, it doesn't mean that it does not deserves the recognition that it has been getting the past year. It goes right up there with films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and Star Wars'. 'Avatar' widens your eyes. It's an unexpected look into a beautiful world of filmmaking. Several years from now, some director will make a film that will breakthrough moviegoers expectancies of whatever film they watch. 'Avatar' did that. How many times have you seen a film like that? 'Avatar' is not just a film. It's an experience that will be remembered by moviegoers for years to come.",Null,2,6,31 January 2011

"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," I have no respect for this film.
","'Salo,or the 120 Days of Sodom'to some people is a work of art that explains what happens during World War II when a group of children are subjected to the most inhumane and cruel treatment of sexually craved aristocrats in fascist Italy.The children are forced to become slaves and live in a world of fear and eventually that world of fear wraps around the viewer who is watching the movie.I rented 'Salo'a couple of months ago and I compared it to other films that shot out elements of horror.'I Spit on Your Grave' was disturbing but was also funny (no,the rape scenes were not funny,not one bit)because of the acting.'Salo' is the kind of film that was so nightmarish,that I am actually giving a warning to those who have not seen this film yet.Stay away from this film.Some people who had seen this film I talked to and they explained to me that the director was making a point about humanity.Bull!!!There are other ways to make points about the world we live in besides filming a movie that is simply a movie with no plot.'Salo'is the most disgusting and most horrifying film of the last century or in movie history.Avoid this worthless piece of trash.That's all this film is.I hated it.Hopefully,some of you won't be subjected to this pile of trash that should have never been made.",Null,2,6,6 November 2000

'Speed' eventually is a fast ride that goes faster and faster.The situations become more dangerous and the finale involving the train is one of the most exciting.I enjoyed 'Speed' a whole lot and Keanu Reeves makes a surprisingly great action hero.'Speed' is one ride you will not want to get off of.",10,1,3,4 September 2001
