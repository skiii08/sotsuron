Mad Max: Fury Road," Why Americans films have become so bad
","I have to believe that the initial reviews are fake. Especially since there are so many using the same verbiage - like the word 'masterpiece'. This film is very very far from a masterpiece. In fact, I think the word garbage would be more appropriate.The film opens and closes without giving a back story or any character development. I'm guessing we're supposed to remember the previous films from 30 years ago. But besides that, it is nothing more than cheesy CGI effects and over the top action (using a lot of stop motion camera work that makes it look cartoonish).I once googled 'why American films have become so bad?' and the links that came up explained that because much of the film industry money is now made overseas, films have to have very little dialogue and lots of action - so that they translate to other cultures. Well this movie succeeds at that but as far as any discernible plot or concern for the characters - it fails on every level.",1,34,74,17 May 2015
