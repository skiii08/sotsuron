It," As a Fan of the book/ and as a stand alone
","As a fan of the book. Waited a month until family was together to go see movie. Having all recently read the book( me for third time) Everyone's first comment was 'did they even read the book?' Now I realize that converting a 1000+ page book into a 2+ hour movie will require some things be dropped, even if you delete the adult section. Seriously though, besides the names of the characters and the fact that villain appears as a clown, I found very few correlations. Spoilers Time period-1958 vs 1986. denies many of the tensions and fears of the heroes. Age-5th grade vs jr high. again 11-12 year olds have a completely different outlook on life than 15-16 year olds. Parents- the hero's relationships with their parents are central to the story. Here, they are either dead (mike) overblown (Eddie) re imagined (henry) or missing (everyone else, besides the fathers of bev and bill) Central themes- missing vs dead (gorgie) Added characters, reasons why losers club is hated by bowers, reassignment of hero's roles, 'beep beep' 'high-O silver', the list could be as long as the novel. As a stand alone If I had never heard of IT before, this movie would still only score a 2 or 3 for me. Characters were flat and uninteresting, I felt no reason to care for any of them. Clown was scary until, they used cgi to turn him into beetleguise. Besides Gorgie, deaths were boring and uneventful. Between IT and The Dark Tower, I would suggest that when Mr. King states he likes a film adaptation of his excellent work, Run.",2,2,5,8 October 2017
