The Blair Witch Project," Genius concept, no follow through!
","I rated it 4 because the style was original. It wasn't totally commercial (product placement, etc.) and upon it's release, without public knowledge that it was a totally fictional movie, actually scared the hell out of lots of people. I don't care if some say it's based on a true story. The movie is 100% fictional. I made films in college more than 30 years ago and always did well. The potential this movie had to be a knock out success was there. Soon after the trio gets lost, the movie loses it way. Then it gets irritating. Then if falls flat on it's face, or should I say, the camera falls and we are left to speculate. Was it the witch? Was it that psycho killer?... Who cares? I lost any sympathy for the characters when their only main response to the confusion was bitching and moaning and blaming each other and using the 'F...' word with every breath. Here's some suggestions on what could have helped this movie immensely. 1.) A little more evidence of something out of the norm could be found in the mornings after they hear spooky sounds in the night. 2.) Heather doesn't sound so ridiculously sure of herself when the map just ain't cutting it. 3.) The trio spends some logical time discussing what they are experiencing, then turn on the camera and focus on one or more of them giving a speech in regards to it, referring to notes. I really can see this as a way to build the tension. 4.) A gradual unveiling of the trios growing insanity, that even though they are walking in generally the same direction, they are coming upon nothing; impossible. How could that be? And they would video each other commenting on it. Even in the midst of death, filmmakers in war zones are dedicated to their art! These college kids, the future leaders of society, are making a documentary. At least that's what they're supposed to be doing. Their emotional outbursts in this movie is going overboard. 5.) Why doesn't just one of them try to start a fire? That would get some rangers and more. 6.) A little nudity would have helped. Come on Heather, what else is there to do? 7.) A little more controlled handling of the video recorder would have been nice. The camera work was no better than a bunch of stoned high school kids screwing around. The movie had great potential, but it was as if the scriptwriter and/or filmmakers just ran out of ideas. Well, I know this is a good cheap formula for film-making, so I'll use it in the next film I make with my nephew. He'll be in college soon. I think the quality of this film suffered when most of the money for it's production was used in the avant-garde television advertising.",4,0,1,7 March 2008
Hardball," Entertaining, even if it is total FANTASY!
","How many bookies are out there who will take a word of mouth bet from somebody who owes? For that matter, how many gambling idiots have thugs after them?--we will beat you up an kill you if you don't pay us now-- This movie is entertaining and does touch on some important subjects, but the clich√©s just don't stop. Innocent people die frequently in lower income neighborhoods from stray bullets that are from gang activity. It would have made some sense for us to see more police in the movie. But I guess that would take away from the plot. Plot?....A loser white guy is called on to help the inner-city black kids in South Chicago's projects? I guess Hollywood believes there's incredible funding for the children in America's ghettos. OK Reeves, get to work dude, like, these kids in da hood are like, counting on you. Now Ms Lane is still insanely pretty, but her placement in the movie is hard to believe. That's not to say that there are no white people working with black kids in the inner-city, but think about it. I've worked in an inner-city school in California and just helping the kids during the school day was a challenge. For outside of school activities, ridiculous amounts of preparation had to be worked on. Now, maybe Chicago doesn't have as many communication problems that California does with non-English speaking parents, but just being able to talk with parents who speak English takes time and often doesn't go well. Try getting the older daughter, with a mother who works three jobs, to set up a time, for the teacher, or coach in this case, to talk with the mother about her 11 year old son's need to start paying attention. This movie doesn't even go near subjects like that. I not too put off by Keanu's acting ability in this movie, though I still think he's a one-trick pony, and there were no tricks in this script for him to do. He still seems likable. But, a white guy who's a ticket scalping, gambling loser coaching a little league team of poor black kids in the projects....??? I guess Hollywood still thinks that the lives of poor black kids in the inner-cities can only be improved with help from caring white people (even if these are white people with shady backgrounds). There's no need to mention that just shopping for food in the low-income communities is sometimes impossible. Maybe an already made sandwich from the corner liquor store will satisfy the kids hunger, but the city bus line to that one suburban-like big grocery store in the neighborhood one and a half miles away has been canceled and Mama's going to have to figure out another way to get some real food that's affordable. I'm sorry, but although the movie hits some subjects that need to be discussed in our society, the script needs some major work. Why can't these ultra-rich studio executives consider getting input from the social workers in the inner-city, some active residents, teachers, youths, some freshly out of jail young men who are working on cleaning themselves up, etc. Sickeningly rich movie producers just have no idea what the real world is like for most working people. But, this movie is still fun to watch when I've got nothing else to do.",5,1,2,14 April 2007
Rock Star," What's up?
","OK movie, but come on. Where's the mirrors and the blades, the white nostrils? Without it, the band & their entourage would be passed out & sleeping on the floor a lot of the time, that is, when they aren't onstage, backstage, or talking with their managers, crew members, fans, etc. Also, the floor would often be in a bus, a van, a delivery truck, or in somebody else's motor home in a parking lot on the way to, or at the next stadium or theater or wherever the gig is. I think the hint that Steel Dragon's PR lady, 'Tania Asher', is probably a tranny, is a funny part of the entertainment industry. It is not at all uncommon, at least on the west coast & in NYC. But, please Hollywood! You've got plenty of real tranny actor's, actress's, or whatever you want to call them ready for work everyday. I have known several of them, all XY transforming to XX. You can find them all over LA. They are bartenders, waitresses, 'T-women of the night'. Many of them are incredibly talented & some of those females, uh... males, are, hummm; you would never have known! I looked up that actress, Dagmara Dominczyk, & she really is a woman. If you wanted to touch the real world a little more, there were quite a few already established performers. Why couldn't you make offers to Jahna Steele, Vaniity, or an intersex actress like Eva Robin's? Eva & other ones you could have hired might need a dubbed over voice, but what's the biggie? You could have also looked for some tranny singers to add some spice to your 'Hair-Band' theme. I'm not sure about when this movie was made, but now you could get people like Harisu. And, let me tell all you overly MACHO Heteros out there, Harisu could scare you. Was your pretty girlfriend born female? 'Rock Star' showed a condensed version of the rock world of the 80's, but it was quite sanitized & Hollywoodized. The movie needed to show more of the real stress & extremism of that world, that insanity, that speckled reality. Oh yeah, I guess the REAL WORLD is not Hollywood.",5,1,1,17 February 2009
