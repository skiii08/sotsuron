Catch Me If You Can," Poor
","Clearly, the Knock Knock line was the worst thing about this film, which is quite an achievement given that there were a lot of things wrong with this film. It has got to be one of the most shockingly pathetic and useless lines in film history. Unbelievable!",4,3,8,2 July 2003
Dumb and Dumber," Yes!
","Basically, this films contains a certain brand of humour. And you either love it or you dont. I happen to love it and thus i find this film immensely funny.The main thing which makes it stand out from other comedies is the fact that it manages to sustain a consistently high level of humour throughout the film. At no time does it drag, as is often the case with most comedies thesedays. Films like Theres Something About Mary tend to have their funny, laugh-out-loud moments but they are few and far between.Carrey and Daniels play off each other very well. I think this film works extremely well for Carrey (a generally comedic actor) because its not all about him and he is not always relied upon to make the audience laugh, unlike in Ace Ventura where he is forced to be the constant source of humour which thus makes it harder to sustain such a high level of humour. Daniels has his fair share of one-liners and so this periodically helps to take the focus away from Carrey which is probably a good thing because his unique style of humour is not always to everyones taste!All in all, this is a very funny film which is extremely quotable and that is always the sign of a good film (one that sticks in your head). Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?",7,0,2,13 March 2003
