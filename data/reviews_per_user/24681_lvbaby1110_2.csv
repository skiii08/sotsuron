The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Four films later and they finally nailed it.
","OK, so I am writing my review around the fact that I am a Twilight fan. If I were not a Twilight fan to begin with, however, I would still give it a 7 out of 10. I am not going to lie, I got teary-eyed during the wedding and the climactic ending had me on the edge of my seat. For the most part, the movie followed the book pretty well. They didn't add too much or take anything to vital to the plot away. It was pretty much a 'cliff notes' adaptation of the book. After I read some of the reviews on here, I couldn't get a good, honest idea about what the film was like based on what was written. After seeing the film, I can give an honest opinion that the film is not Gone With the Wind or anything, but it was a more than decent film. The make up was fantastic, the acting was a huge improvement from the previous films, and the film had many breathtaking moments, from the wedding, to the honeymoon, to the last scene. It was by far the best film in the series thus far. If you like Twilight, go see this film and I promise you won't be disappointed!",10,4,15,23 November 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," This isn't just your 'average' reboot. This is an improvement on the original trilogy!
","Without giving too much away, if anything at all, this is certainly a new and improved Spider Man and by far the best film adaptation yet that will have you on the edge of your seat waiting for each of the next turns! Andrew Garfield brings Peter Parker to life and brings quite a new depth to the character that I didn't even know could be reached. The acting was fantastic and the film, overall, has me falling in love with Spider Man all over again. I have come to realize that the reviews I have read on IMDb from other users must have been written to make the movie look bad because most of the reviews were as far from the truth as possible, and I am a pretty harsh critic, especially with the 'gems' Hollywood shells out to us today. All in all, I recommend everyone who is a fan of Spider Man, or just good films in general, go see this movie. You won't be disappointed!",10,7,15,3 July 2012
