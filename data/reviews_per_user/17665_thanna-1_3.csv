United 93," Heart Wrenching!
","I've been going to movies for decades, I'm a big guy that can handle almost anything physically and emotionally... Never have I seen a movie so well made that it brought tears to my eyes, and aches to my heart. The filming, the music, the acting - NOTHING could have been done better in this outstanding production of a historic and tragic event. Everyone needs to see this movie - TO REMEMBER! It's been 4.5 years since 9/11, and many have forgotten why we are where we are today. I've had a flag hanging outside ever since, not once has it came down. I totally support every option to help stop terrorism, and I'm glad we have a President that has done his best to secure America. We had Bin Laden twice during the Clinton administration, and he was let go... WHY?Thomas",10,2,6,2 May 2006
Watchmen," Watchmen... The Worst!
","Watchmen, the worst and most boring movie I have ever waisted my time watching. Extremely slow plot, long and boring story about a bunch of has been super hero's that are - in reality - a bunch of misfits. Thank god I never paid to see this in the theater, I just purchased it 'Cheap' on sale at a video store. What a waist of money.......

Knowing," Seen Knowing Today - EXCELLENT!!!
","Plain and simple, it's a damn good movie. Knowing is a must see for everyone, and very well written too. The story was great, the acting was great, and the special effects looked as real as it comes. It kept me glued to my seat throughout, no matter how bad I needed to head for the bathroom, I suffered and stayed in my seat. Two thumbs up in my book.When Knowing comes out on video or DVD, I'll be adding it to my video library. Nicholas Cage was right for this part, and the child actors and actresses were very good too. The story was very creative, and you'll know what I mean as you watch the show. I don't want to let out anything, the show is that good to see and you don't want someone to spoil it for you.TC",10,2,9,1 April 2009
