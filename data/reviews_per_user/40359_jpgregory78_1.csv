Source Code," Much more than I expected
",I saw a preview for this movie a while ago and thought it would be entertaining but probably not much more. I ended up seeing it somewhat on accident because my show times app had some wrong times.I found it to be positively exceptional. I was surprised by the level of emotion the movie offered. I thought the repetitiveness would get old quickly but it was mixed up and changed enough to keep you very interested.I finished watching it over two hours ago and I am still thinking about elements and aspects of it. Very few movies do that for me and that is what makes it exceptional.,8,1,4,1 April 2011
