Men in Black 3," A return to fun
","After the rather soulless drag of MIB2, I wasn't expecting much from another sequel, but this grabbed me from the get go. It's occasionally clunky, especially early on, but it's just such good fun that I didn't really mind. It felt like exactly what a good sequel ought to be - character development for familiar faces, entertaining new characters, and above all recapturing the atmosphere of the original. This film did a fantastic job of telling an engaging new story, which did a good job of balancing the funny, the dramatic and the emotional, with a fine sense of ludicrous fun which paid homage to the original whilst maintaining its own independent feel. The story is not a mind-blowing narrative, but it's wacky enough to leave you satisfied, and its hilarious yet menacing antagonist drives the story to its surprisingly poignant conclusion. A genuinely enjoyable watch.",7,0,2,7 November 2017
The Incredible Hulk," Just very average
","The whole thing feels bitty - the dreadful, amateurish 'previously on...'- style opening; the clunky, set-piece story progression; the sense that secondary characters and storylines are rushed and abandoned without proper exploration (the boyfriend, Sterns, etc.); the lack of buildup for Blonsky as a character to give him real menace as Abomination. It's not really a bad film, it's just a bit dull - the moves are predictable, the characters aren't engaging, and it doesn't leave any kind of impression beyond 'I guess that was ok.' The performances are generally decent, although nothing revelatory, but the film just feels as though it is going through the motions. Not one to remember.",5,0,2,25 August 2018
John Wick," Not quite there
","The simplicity of this film is attractive. Straightforward characters, motivations and storytelling. It doesn't get hung up on unnecessary backstory or fleshing out characters beyond what they need to be. For an all-out action film, this is a good and refreshingly honest choice - it maintains the pace, makes the transitions through the story slick, and allows you to sit back and enjoy it. It is also a risky tactic, because the lack of depth demands that every element of the film be tight and foolproof. It nearly pulls it off - the performances, which have to drive the narrative and create the energy in the absence of detail - are all excellent, and the leads very well cast. Unfortunately, the film seems to chicken out at certain crucial moments, falling back on tired tropes to manufacture tension. Wick makes one or two decisions which do not fit in with the limited picture we have of him, and therefore feel incongruous. There's a clumsy 'kill everyone except the woman and then regret it later' cliché. Most disappointing is the age-old 'antagonist walks away leaving henchmen to kill hero' trope, which feels utterly stupid and out of place in a world constructed as deliberately ruthless. Viggo is supposed to understand the situation and the man he is up against. He knows his ability to escape impossible situations, and he knows how many times his own men have failed. He has no affection for John, and he wants him dead, but he leaves his armed henchmen alone in the room to suffocate him with a plastic bag!? This ruins the whole atmosphere and aesthetic of the film.Despite these disappointing moments, this has enough to it to make it a worthwhile watch. An honest action flick is one to be praised.",6,0,1,26 November 2017
Kung Fu Panda," Hilarious
","I can never get tired of this film, no matter how many times I watch it. The characters are superbly realised, well-voiced, and engaging throughout. The visuals are stunning, with landscapes, backdrops, and object design superb, and character design which suits the setting whilst also adding a great deal to the characters themselves, while the 2D segments are equally beautiful whilst adding variety to the tone of the story. The story is straightforward, but manages to be dramatic and moving without resorting to melodrama, and is above all enormously entertaining. The humour, too, is pretty simple - juvenile, in many cases - but it never fails to make me laugh. A rollicking good ride.",8,1,1,23 August 2017
Madagascar," Middle of the road
","Pretty bog standard Dreamworks 'kooky anthropomorphic animals have a wacky adventure' fare. The animation is mixed - some beautiful moments, but some rather basic looking character design. Good enough to get by, but doesn't win any prizes, especially watched now. The fast pace means one doesn't get bored, but it means the conflicts and adversities which are supposed to add depth to the plot are left at a rather playground level. The film depends on the reasonably slick interplay between the four main characters for its impetus, but it doesn't have much more than that going for it, other than an enjoyable cameo from Sacha Baron Cohen as King Julien. Probably one of those kids films which really is more for the kids. Overall, some memorable lines, a few smiles, but not much more than that. Not one you'd regret watching, but not worth a return visit.",5,0,0,20 August 2017
Watchmen," A valiant effort
","This is hard one to describe. Looking at it coldly, it's overlong, messy, and sometimes frustratingly confusing, and yet I came out of it feeling thoroughly glad I'd seen it. I haven't read the graphic novel - as with V for Vendetta, I wanted to enjoy the film for itself without it having to live up to the original in my mind - but I look forward to doing so. From my scant knowledge of it, it sounds like a very difficult thing to adapt into a film, and I think that this actually does a reasonable job. You can feel it straining to contain its content at times, particularly in the first half, but once it gets into its swing, it begins to enjoy its own chaos, and feels more fluid. This is a flawed effort, but no less entertaining for it. It's not quite funny enough to make laughter possible, and not quite dark enough to feel truly desolate, but the balance, whilst not mind- blowingly feels-inducing, is effective, and generates a atmospheric integrity that lends weight to proceedings. The characters are intriguing, if occasionally confusing, and I appreciated the fact that I didn't recognise many faces, as this allowed characters without a greatly developed backstory to have independent weight. There are some fine performances: The Comedian stands out, as does Rorschach, despite appearing disconcertingly to use the same voice modulator as Bale's Batman. It's just a shame that the ultimate villain reveal is rather obvious from early on. Overall, despite its problems, this is a worthwhile watch because it feels like it was made with genuine heart. There is a sense that it is not quite good enough to be an unqualified success, but it also film feels as though it admits its own difficulties - it doesn't take itself too seriously, giving itself the freedom to have fun. This bravery is commendable.",7,0,1,20 November 2017
Kung Fu Panda 2," Spectacular
","Whilst not quite as well-balanced as the first film (perhaps because of the greater emphasis on spectacular action throughout - the the story doesn't build quite as effectively), this is such an entertaining film. It is stunningly beautifully animated, especially in its set pieces, which are even more ambitious than the first film. The music is once again wonderfully atmospheric. Whilst it would have been nice to see a little more character development from characters other than Po, this might have over complicated matters, and the film relies, quite rightly, on its slickness and pace to ramp up the drama. The story itself is well crafted, the villain excellent, and the finale is, strange though it may be to say it, one of my all-time favourite pieces of cinema. It is exciting, moving, and amusing in one explosive great cocktail (or should I say peacocktail?) A film I never get tired of watching - superb entertainment.",7,0,1,24 August 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Self-conscious
","The trouble with this film is that it knows we don't need it. It is all too aware that it is retelling a story that everybody already knows, not only because it is possibly the most famous of all superhero origin stories, but because of its proximity to the 2002 original. Because of this, it seems caught in two minds - should the origin story be told carefully, acknowledging that it is rehashing a familiar tale but making sure it does it convincingly and with better and slicker effects; or should it be skipped through as quickly as possible to get to the real meat of the story? The answer appears to be neither. The elements of the story are all there, and are solid enough, but it is almost as though they are set pieces, chapters to be ticked off. This over-careful stacking of elements creates a perfectly logical structure (though the jerky adjustments in scene and tone leave some parts over-padded and others underdeveloped), but it is one which is sadly uninteresting, providing little in the way of tension or co- ordinated escalation of drama. In a similar vein, characters don't develop, but suddenly - and I mean in a matter of moments - entirely change their motivations, allegiances, and even personalities to suit the direction of the story. It is a whirlwind, and it gives the impression that, perhaps because it believes that their familiarity will automatically win the audience over, it doesn't care about its characters.This film has some good scenes, and is generally well acted (though Andrew Garfield just isn't dweeby enough to be believable as pre- bite Parker), but that's really all that can be said for it. It is just 'ok', and I don't think those who made it were really convinced it could be more.",5,0,1,21 October 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Standard fare - but that's fine
","If you're into the MCU, this is a solid offering. Interesting story, some good set pieces, new characters add to the dynamic without feeling intrusive, and it delivers on its title (despite necessarily pulling one or two punches for logic's sake). Does have a little too much of the recent tendency of feeling like an episode rather than a standalone film - it is independent enough to be enjoyable, and I understand this is sort of how the MCU works, but by this point there's so much going on you'd almost rather some of the threads were a little more self-contained. Nevertheless, aside from a few slightly over-convenient/inconvenient jumps in the storytelling (probably necessary given the runtime) it's actually impressively well crafted. It would have been easy for this to be a bit of mess, but it feels slick, and doesn't lose its way. Overall, nothing groundbreaking - difficult now that we can pretty much predict most of the characters' actions throughout - but it's a good solid effort, and worth a watch.",7,0,1,15 April 2018
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Just...fine
","There's just - just - enough to this film to keep you watching, but no more. Visually, it is interesting. In fact, the inventive mixture of comic-book, video game and live action is the film's biggest plus. I particularly appreciated the fact that there was no attempt to confine the vivacity of the world to any tedious real-world logic. It is over-the-top, it is impossible, it works. Unfortunately, the settings and the generic urban colour palettes are just a bit too blank, sapping some of the character from the scenes.
There are also a handful of good laughs, although much of the humour didn't really fly with me. I could, however, appreciate the artistry of it - it was well-written, just not to my taste.
Unfortunately, there's not much else to commend. I am not familiar with the original story, but the film's adaptation of it is paper-thin. There is so little in the way of nuance, and it feels very one-paced. The middle hour of the film made absolutely no impression on my perception of the characters, and the formula quickly became tedious and repetitive, meaning that the ending, devoid of all tension by what precedes it, was a damp squib. This is at least in part down to the emptiness of the characters. A simple story can be mightily effective with some charismatic leads, but they're just so dull. The band are soulless, the exes might as well all be the same person for all the scope they're allowed, Michael Cera sleepwalks through playing himself as usual, and Ramona is a husk of utterly conventional unconventionality. The only one who I developed any interest in was Knives.
All in all, a bit of a disappointment - an interesting experiment let down by an uninspiring story and a strange lack of spark.",5,1,2,15 February 2018
Hellboy," Fails to deliver
","Hellboy's initial act sets you up for a wild ride, and promises much in its first half. The characters are interesting, the story has potential, and the concept of the film is engaging. Unfortunately, it loses its impetus more and more the further it goes, and while it remains visually interesting, it becomes hammy, lumbering and predictable.
I think it suffers from the lack of a really fine villain. Kroenen simply isn't menacing enough - he is a curiosity, but his lack of humanity actually lets him down as an antagonistic presence, and his death is a bit underwhelming considering his previous resurrections. Rasputin is well played, but he is a little too much in the background. We know he's there, but the fact of that almost makes it uninteresting, since there is no relationship between him and Hellboy of Broom - things which might have been interesting to explore - and so he can almost be forgotten until his inevitable return. The Lovecraftian gods, similarly, are not given enough mythical weight to act as anything other than a vaguely unpleasant looking threat. You feel the man himself would have conveyed the horror far better.
It is a shame - whilst Hellboy never gives any indication of being a masterpiece, it could have been a solidly enjoyable film, but the way the story wraps up feels somehow hurried, or, as it certainly doesn't feel too short, perhaps simply clumsy, as if the writers got tired of it. There are also a number of irritating loose ends. The action set pieces are pretty good, although nothing new really emerges as the film goes on, meaning that by the climax it has lost some of its edge. The film's best feature is certainly its lead, who looks, sounds, and absolutely acts the part, though all the performances - particularly John Hurt and Doug Jones - are excellent. It's a shame the story ultimately leaves them fighting a losing battle.",5,1,2,21 March 2018
Kick-Ass," Crazy
","Good fun. The ironic tropes are maybe a little overplayed, the convenience of the plot movements can be a bit cringey, and I always find there to be little emotional weight in the characters, but it is just damn good fun. A lot can be forgiven of a story that just enjoys itself - it's crazy, it's garish, it's full of holes, but it just drives on without leaving you too much time to pull it apart, and by the end you've had a good time. Great set pieces, and generally well acted. Ultimately, it's watchable - and, crucially, rewatchable - and refreshingly straightforward without being lightweight. Not bad at all.",7,0,1,21 March 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Surprisingly watchable
","A rare case of the sequel being an upgrade on the first installment. This film is a mixed bag. It sometimes suffers from the same disjointed storytelling as its predecessor, and is often corny as hell and therefore predictable. There are too many competing story lines, and they don't entirely add up or resolve themselves. Spiderman is a certified jerk. There are some bits that just don't quite work - how, for instance, a man who consistently demonstrated to be made of pure electricity, and who can disseminate himself at will, can be physically punched and tied up in the final battle is beyond me. But the characters themselves are intriguing, well-cast, compelling, and visually exemplary. The best thing about this film is that it feels quite like a video game - the segmented nature of the plot, the visuals, particularly in the Electrode battles, and the overall tone really take you along for the ride, and it was quite refreshing to have a film like this just having some fun with its content, something which the first installment entirely failed to do. Doing so draws the eye away from the problems, making them, if not less noticeable, then at least less irritating. This is a deeply flawed film, but once it gets into its stride (which, admittedly, takes a while) it is pretty good fun. The ending is surprisingly brave, and is a powerful way to round off the narrative. Also, any film that nicks its final scene from The Incredibles knows what's good for it. Glad I watched it.",6,0,0,23 October 2017
Men in Black II," Joyless
","This film is OK, but just OK. At it's best it's slick, at it's worst it's clunkily predictable. It's fast-paced, which sometimes lets you ignore the flaws in the storytelling, but at others makes thing jerky and monotonous.The characters from the original are still entertaining here, but they haven't really developed, and the new additions are one- dimensional. It's watchable, and I didn't zone out of the action, but there's just no spark. It doesn't really add anything new to what we got from the original, it isn't funny enough, and it doesn't really leave you feeling anything. One to while away an empty 90 minutes, but not more than once.",5,2,3,1 November 2017
Jurassic World," Dull, dire, disappointing
","This film, mainly because of Chris Pratt, makes just enough of its one- dimensional plot to be watchable, but it is a dreadful mess. The plot formula is long worn out, to the extent that any form of believability is absent. That's not to say that a film about a dinosaur theme park ought to be realistic, but the characters are so moronic, and the key story elements so ludicrous and formulaic, that there is not enough left to tie it to the real world in which it sets its fantasy, and therefore there is no reason to care. This is not helped by wooden stock characters and the utterly predictable relationships between them. This film is a monotone, generic smashy-crashy blockbuster, devoid of charm, nuance, or emotional depth. And to add insult to injury, despite over 20 years of improved technology, the CGI dinosaurs are rendered less realistically than their counterparts from the original Jurassic Park! What a disappointment.",4,5,6,18 August 2017
Groundhog Day," A charmer
","Initially, I wasn't convinced by this film, but as it developed, the situation matured, the characters grew, and I became thoroughly invested. What an intriguing concept this is, and how cleverly it is told. The repeating day formula could easily become hammy, unfunny and tedious, but it is constructed beautifully. The key to this is the absence of long-term temporal reference - we are stuck in the same day as Phil, but without knowing how much we haven't seen. We see relationships at key points, we see plans at their inspiration and at their culmination, and the way we are constantly made to play catchup and fill in the blanks contributes to a sense that we are sharing and matching Phil's relationship with his predicament. A simple premise continually manages to find new avenues to surprise us, without ever feeling as though its movements are purposeless. There is a fantastic sense of direction here, and it makes the film far deeper than initially expected. This film plays with you gently, and charms you into engaging in what appears a mundane setup. Very well done.",7,0,0,20 November 2017
How to Train Your Dragon," Charming
","How to Train Your Dragon is a triumphant piece of storytelling. It has humour, it has emotional depth, it has engaging drama, and its action set pieces carry genuine weight, without the film having to rely on them for thrills.The star of the show is Toothless - I've watched this film a number of times, and he never fails to make me laugh, and to make me care. He is animated superbly, his movements and expressions giving him immense charm and personality without resorting to the caricatured anthropomorphism Dreamworks so often deals in. Indeed, the film as a whole strikes a perfect balance between cartoon character design and aesthetics - there are some breathtakingly beautiful scenes, especially in the landscape shots.There is very little to find fault with in this film, except the children, who seem to have been lifted from a cheap American high school movie and dropped into a Viking setting, accents and all. That's not to say that the characters aren't engaging - Hiccup himself has huge personality as the protagonist, and the rest of the gang act as effective foils - it's just that they occasionally detract somewhat from the atmosphere. Then again, one could say the same thing about the rest of the Vikings sounding Scottish - fortunately, this isn't the sort of film that needs to rely on accuracy!Ultimately, such little niggles don't detract from what is a superb piece of work. I will keep returning to this film again and again, because it is just such tremendous fun.",8,0,0,22 August 2017
Les Misérables," Rough Diamond
","This is a very difficult film to assess. It has significant flaws, but on reflection I believe this to be principally down to the difficulties of translating this musical into a film. To begin with, I was seriously underwhelmed - the opening sequences seemed overblown and melodramatic, and the storytelling rather clumsy, particularly in its knitting together of scenes. As the film progressed, however, I began to realise that these faults were actually fairly similar to the faults with the musical itself - I have always found the opening scenes, with their hyperactive drama compensating for rushed narrative, to be the weakest of the show. Having accepted this, I relaxed and began to appreciate what was being done. In many ways this is a remarkable piece of work. Visually, it is utterly stunning, be it set design, costume or cinematography. The big numbers are superbly rendered in a broader space than is available on stage, giving a real sense of scale and weight to the production. Most importantly, it retains the emotional tug of the musical. I honestly wasn't expecting it, but as the old familiar songs emerged I felt myself drawn further and further into the story, as I have always felt in the theatre, and come the ending, as usual, I was a blubbering wreck. I had expected a polished effort, but I had not expected the film to so fully engage me. To make an audience feel is a powerful skill, and it was used to full advantage here.Despite all this, I cannot really give the film top marks. Whilst I accepted the flaws of the opening, it was still disappointing that no solution had been attempted. I was also rather horrified by Hugh Jackman's remarkable changes of accent - in the first quarter of an hour he cycled indiscriminately through Irish, Australian, American, and several of the major British regional dialects. Once he settled, he was a passable Valjean - his voice matured through the film, and his acting was solid. Eddie Redmayne gave a surprisingly fine performance as Marius, and many of the minor characters were well played. I was, however, disappointed with some of the casting. The principal voices, overall, were a mixed bag. Whilst I wasn't myself a fan of Anne Hathaway's Fantine, despite its widespread admiration, I could accept its objective merits. Russell Crowe is seriously miscast as Javert, lacking menace, and with a voice entirely ill- suited to its purpose. Not his fault, just a bad casting decision. The Tenardiers, too were a disappointment - Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter are fine actors, but they played their roles far too much down the kooky path for my liking - weirdness for weirdness' sake, without the genuinely slimy charm and wit the roles deserve.Nevertheless, this film will remain a fond memory for me, and will get a rewatch one day - anything that can invoke such deep emotion has a true spark of genius in it, despite its flaws.",7,1,1,30 November 2017
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Horrific
","Absolutely horrifically awful. I've given it as much as 3 because I did at least make it to the end, though I regretted doing so. The script is horrendous, rendering every character as a hammy caricature - this is not helped by a a great deal of overacting, and such delights as Keanu Reeves' 'English' accent. The cinematography would be interesting if it were consistent, but the changes in tone are too drastic to allow it to become atmospheric, meaning itoften feels gimmicky. The cartoon sexiness, whilst a valid angle to take on the story, is unintentionally hilarious, and really destroys any sense of menace in the vampire scenes, especially when combined with the bizarre wolfman form of Dracula, which is a strange idea even without the terrible costume.
Some of these flaws would be excusable if this film was its own animal, but when your title is 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', you must expect some form of comparison to be drawn. This isn't even remotely similar in tone, characterisation, atmosphere, anything. It rushes at breakneck speed through events where the book, admittedly a slow burner, builds suspense superbly - this pushes the film's story into the realm of pastiche, and in failing to take enough care to make anything really matter, fails to justify its ending in the way the book does. There is no suspense whatsoever, and neither is there any real horror.
To be fair, they gave a little more agency to the women, and a little more circularity to the plot, corny and nonsensical as it was, but beyond this there is nothing to recommend this mess. A great disappointment.",3,3,5,25 April 2018
Jaws," I wish I'd seen it when it came out.
","Jaws is a film which has probably suffered from its own popularity. Watching it for the first time now, inured to the endless tawdry sensationalism of all the shark attack stories that have followed, the great original loses some of its punch. The first half, in particular, suffers badly from this, and the uninteresting family relationships and bargain-basement small town politics contribute to a sense of shallowness and predictability. It is not a worthy setup for the second half, in which the film comes into its own. With the three men on their boat and the shark in the water, the tension is high, the dynamic between the men and its development under pressure is fascinating, and the shark feels genuinely mysterious and menacing, particularly with the clever minimisation of visual contact with the model. The ending doesn't quite do it justice, but on the whole the second half is a damn good yarn, and makes the film worthwhile on its own. Iconic.",7,1,1,11 April 2018
Wonder Woman," A step in the right direction
","The one genuinely epic moment from the trainwreck that was Batman-v- Superman was the emergence of Wonder Woman in the final battle, accompanied by that gut-shivering signature riff. Such moments of brilliance are the signature of Wonder Woman's own film, and allied to touches of high drama, perfect delivery of comic lines, and slick action, there is much to enjoy. But somehow, despite all this, the film feels as though there are just as many points where it misses the mark. It's sense of time is this film's weakest point. On a macro scale, it felt, curiously, both over-long for its actual content, and too short to fully explain it's own story. This is demonstrated best by the painting-by-numbers opening segment which feels both too long to be an effectively punchy setup to the main narrative, and too short to fully engage with - or, worryingly, care about) its characters, and to add real dramatic tension to the parts of its plot which carry over into the rest of the film. This is yet another consequence of DC's corner-cutting approach in attempting to catch its cinematic universe up with its rivals - an origin story and a link in to the modern world in which the character has already been situated by B-v-S are crammed into one film, with neither given enough weight. Whilst it is limiting to rate DC films simply by comparison with Marvel, they need to earn the right to be taken on their own merits. I found myself comparing it with Captain America: The First Avenger, a film which, whilst not extraordinary, was a solid and effective setup for the character of Steve Rogers. By the time Winter Soldier comes about, Cap is a fully fledged character - we know his motivations, history, personality, etc., and therefore can concentrate on a more complex and interesting story than was offered in the first film. Wonder Woman tries to do all of this in one go, and the result is confused. The other useful parallel with Captain America is between Steve Rogers' band of soldiers, and Steve Trevor's in Wonder woman. Because Rogers is the centre of the story, it doesn't matter that the members of his crew were fairly forgettable - they were simply foils to their leader, and that worked. Wonder Woman seems to want more than this for Trevor's gang, giving them extra back story, and more independent screen time. The trouble is that because Trevor is - quite rightly, effectively, and often refreshingly willingly - a secondary figure himself, we have very little reason to care about his cronies, and they serve more as slightly irritating distraction than anything else.The biggest disappointment, however, is the clumsy way in which the brilliant moments of the film are knitted together. Too many promising comic and dramatic setups are spoiled by muddled storytelling or clunky bits of dialogue. This is summed up, somewhat ironically, by the signature riff itself. Instead of its expected appearance as Wonder Woman goes 'over the top' into no-man's land - a superb transition between her 'civilised' state and her true warrior form, it is missing until several minutes later, during a mid-action fight with a room- full of soldiers. At this point, the action has been at its height for so long that the riff loses its dramatic edge.But despite these fairly comprehensive criticisms, there is one thing which cannot be faulted, and that is Gal Gadot's performance as the eponymous heroine. She is captivating, charming, utterly believable, constantly engaging, and absolutely feels and looks the part, even when struggling against the clunkier moments of script and story. I found myself genuinely invested in her as a character, beyond simply taking a ride through the story. Significantly, this film also demonstrates the potential of a female lead in a superhero film to great effect, and deals with this new dynamic with slick and often very funny efficiency. The chemistry between Gadot and Pine is excellent, and allows this quite fundamental point to prove its efficacy on its own merit, without artificial stimulus.Whilst I'm not sure this film has much rewatch value - it isn't coherent or layered enough to demand a second viewing, and the ending is unsatisfying - it makes me want to see more of Wonder Woman. Of more general importance is that it restores some faith in DC's cinematic universe. This is a flawed film, but it shows the studio to be heading, we hope, in the right direction.",6,1,4,30 November 2017
Despicable Me," Fun but limited
","A kids film that's very much for the kids. Nothing wrong with that really, but there wasn't much there for even my fairly childish tastes. Some good invention, but the characters felt paper thin and the script a bit lazy. Perhaps I would have enjoyed it more had I seen it before the minions became so universal and tedious. A simple bit of fun, but probably not one I'd bother with again.",5,1,1,26 August 2018
Thor: The Dark World," Soulless
","Whilst this film is not entirely dreadful, it commits a sin perhaps even worse - it is dull. An uninspired story, formulaic dialogue, and a raft of meaningless characters conspire to make this the worst entry in the Avengers franchise. The last criticism is the most serious - for a film that sets itself up from the first as a battle of the ages between light and dark, the dark is disappointingly, well, opaque. Christopher Ecclestone's considerable talents are utterly wasted as the wooden, one-dimensional and frankly utterly uninteresting Malekith, and the lack of a genuinely characterful or menacing villain cripples the film entirely. He is an empty shell of a character, especially viewed against the beguiling mischievousness of Loki, and it makes the rest of the story, try as it might, a disappointingly run-of-the-mill blockbuster smash fest.The film generally hangs together as an overall effort - the visuals are OK, the acting reasonable, the story, bar some curious leaps even of in-world logic, and some predictably silly plot points, is solid enough for it to be not unwatchable. But there is no spark, nothing to generate enthusiasm, not enough meaningful drama to develop engagement and attachment. Unfortunately, therefore, it is utterly forgettable.",4,0,1,10 September 2017
Deadpool," A slick performance
","7.5
I anticipated finding this a bit of a eye-roller, but I honestly can't find much fault with this other than the fact that it wasn't entirely to my personal taste. It's slick, surprisingly funny, and quite rightly doesn't pull any punches. The casting is good - Reynolds is an excellent lead, and Ed Skrein really makes the best of what is unfortunately a rather dull villain character. The story is occasionally a bit thin, or just misses the mark slightly - possibly owing to the budget constraints, although these seem to have been approached creatively - and there is a tendency to slightly overdo the key elements of fourth-walling, quips, references etc. For my taste, it just missed a little something, but unusually for such a situation, I found myself really appreciating the way the film was put together. Frankly, it's a damn good piece of work, with enough invention to make it fresh without being cringey. It kept me guessing, I didn't look at the time once (always a good sign both of an engaging production and a good length), and I enjoyed myself a lot more than I expected to. Definitely happy to see more.",7,0,2,23 March 2018
The Nice Guys," A riot
","Sometimes it's refreshing to just have fun. There's nothing else going on here, nothing pretentious, no ulterior motives, just a good yarn spun well. It is a straightforward film, in the best possible way - not shallow, just uncomplicatedly enjoyable. In the way it made me feel it reminded me of Baby Driver, which is high praise. It's pacy, it's sharp, at times it is genuinely hilarious, and it bounds along with the enthusiasm of a puppy through the brilliantly organised chaos of its subject and story. The chemistry between the leads is superb, and I can't think of a single performances that wasn't nailed. The only let down is the ending, which didn't quite live up to the rest of the film. It felt, if not quite cut short, then certainly lacking a little something. The rest of the film is such fun that it doesn't matter too much. 7.5/10",8,0,1,24 November 2017
