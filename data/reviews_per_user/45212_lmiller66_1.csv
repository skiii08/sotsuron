Sucker Punch," The Best Movie I've Seen This Year
","I knew I recognized the lead actress, but I couldn't put my finger on what from. I loved Emily Browning in 'A Series of Unfortunate Events'. She's so sexy, yet not trashy and very humble. She's an extremely beautiful woman, I was stunned (in a good way) to make the connection. When I saw that this was the same directed of '300' and 'Watchmen', two movies I also loved, I thought this would be a good movie. I liked Rocket, as well (can't remember the actress name). She has really improved since being Donnie Darko's little girlfriend, and this certainly recovered her from being in 'The Ruins'. The ending was really powerful and moving for me, and I was also pleased to see that it was not a happy ending. I was kind of disappointed that the only character I didn't like lived, but I was pleased that it was a tragic ending (I know it sounds strange, but I don't like typical feel good endings). I will definitely purchase this movie when it releases to DVD. The action scenes were perfectly done, and I was surprised at how well it was done for being PG-13. I have to admit, I thought there were going to be some nudy scenes and a lot more sexy things, but the way it was done was probably more tasteful. I highly recommend this movie.",10,3,13,27 March 2011
