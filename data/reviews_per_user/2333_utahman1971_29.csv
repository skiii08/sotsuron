The Blair Witch Project," BAD as you can get, maybe worse!
","I saw this with thinking a regular horror movie. Wrong this is just made up wanna be horror crap with camcorder wandering the woods with so called people gather up to see how scared they can get, but they fall flat on their face in trying to hard with very bad as you can get acting. For the people that think this is better than the second is something wrong with you. The Sequel should of been the original. This is just to me the worst movie to date and release of it.I left the theater saying what the h*ll was that crap. Then after I hear it was the most watched movie, and I was like WTF! How stupid is that? Very, very, very stupid as you can get. Sorry, for all this that I am saying about this movie. NOT! I feel sad for people that thought this would be something to enjoy. For being rated R. What would be considered R? All their was, was F this F that maybe that was it. LOL! please spare me.More of a funniest home video. What was that girl doing in the tent filming her nostrils with snot hanging out. LOL! That was stupid as heck. I laughed at that more than be scared. It was trying to be what it was not. That is not a horror it was a comedy.Some people tick me off, when they say a terrible movie is better than a better movie. Waste of what was it back then $5 movie price. Cheaper than todays movies, but still a waste. I would not even give a penny for a DVD of this.I really wanted to give this a negative 10.",1,9,16,6 April 2011
The Ring," 10 but not for scary!
","This is an awesome movie but more interesting to watch than to scare the pants off of you. I did not get scared at all. I do not get scared with any PG-13 horror movies. They are just way too tame to be a scary movie. Noises and loud music does not make up to scare the crap out of people. I did not the story and fact it was creepy but that is as scary, if you call it scary as it would be. I am a fan of the gore and violence but this is good for what it is. Most or all of PG-13 horror should actually be considered thrillers instead.",10,1,1,8 April 2020
Dawn of the Dead," What is wrong with fake gore? Love this movie!
","I cannot understand the hate of fake gore. People say it is unnecessary but it is really necessary. All the movies without it are unnecessary, because it is part of horror but not all of horror for a movie. Cutting it out is just basically turning it into a thriller.Irritating to hear someone claim they are a horror fan but can't stand the fake gore. WTH? Do not ever call yourself a horror fan, if you have to only watch movies without gore. Argument never stands with saying there is no need for the fake gore.From start to finish, this is an awesome gory zombie movie. Anyone that keeps talking smack about gore, just is not all there in the head. You could say the for me, that likes it. Well, I do not consider a horror movie without it a horror movie.This movie starts in a hospital and a nurse working, then after work goes home to her husband, but while at work a patient is taken with a bite. Turns out we don't know what is going on until she gets home and hangs out with her husband and has sex, she takes a shower and sleeps at night.In the morning is when hell breaks loose with zombies getting more and more coming. All of a sudden her husband is attack by a kid next door biting him and turning him into one, and then she leaves with her husband trying to attack her.The rest just gets more interesting. You can watch it for yourselves. It is awesome, and for the fake gore haters. Just keep in your PG-13 club, and all the real horror fans will enjoy the real actual horror movies.",10,1,2,29 October 2017
World War Z," One reason and one reason only!
","I will not see this. PG-13 horror does not work. Teenager made movies do not work. Trying to make it for them to wide spread it to make more money does not work. Why? Because it is just made for that. Luckily the director will get some actual true horror fans to see it. I one true horror fan will stick with the one true horror of movies R and Unrated. The true Unrated, not know slightly added fake slop of blood to a PG-13 horror wanna be horror. People say these directors are good. If they can't the genre in the right path, then they are not that good. Simple.I will not even watch warm bodies. Just seeing the trailer was a turn off, and same with this one. Zombies step over each other to get to someone is just plain dumb. I saw that in the trailer, and it is a turn off. I will not ever support PG-13 horror ever again, just for the sake its a want a be horror movie, and does not live to be one. People say that the horror movies of today are getting worse. Well, there is a heck lot more PG-13 horror crap now, then there was at least a decade ago.Even some rated R ones like Paranormal trash are like PG-13, and claimed as rated R. Same with The Conjuring. Holy bomb squad blow those movies up terrible. The blair witch project is another bomb. The lists on the internet for the scariest movies are bombs, because they list PG-13 ones. Yes, no director is getting anything from me as in money towards these kind of movies.Yours truly the horror fan with true horror movies to watch besides this.",1,5,11,22 September 2013
Constantine," Poor reviews from picky people. Not from me.
","I really enjoyed this movie. I have seen this in the theater in 2005. I can not see all the negatives of the things people are saying about this movie, no matter what all they say. I mean they probably go see movie just to pick out the things they hate or just be a picky A** person for no reason or just because they can. Great movie in my book. I like this kind of movie and is one or is the best in this kind of genre. For those that hate to just hate, have personal problems or don't know how to deal with them except to take it out on directors that are doing great. Just because you have problems, does not mean to take it out on anything that comes in your path.I recommend this movie. As for reading comics. I don't read and could care less about them. Comics are for children, and I am passed that since I was out of high school. I did not even read them at all actually. So I would really watch a movie, because it is a movie and not compare them to childish things, and be a complainer for no reason to do it.",10,3,5,14 August 2012
Terminator Salvation," Poor pg-13 out of rated R series
","I do not see how they go from a good rated R movie series to pg-13 stale movie. I really like the first 3 movies. I went and saw this in the theater with jam packed first midnight showing that day before mass showing in theaters. Really regret paying the price for it.The main character that took over in this can't remember his name because I just don't see how he could be that good for this kind of movie as the others. Any who this was the worst one out of the four movies. Not only the PG-13 deal, but the plot sucked and characters really did not draw me in as the others.If they come out with 5th movie please go back to the rated R way and have a different main character. I like the first 3, just not this one at all. For all that rated this high. I hope you enjoyed it. I do not recommend seeing this more than once.",1,11,20,31 March 2011
Cloverfield," What The........
","Has everyone gone on drugs? Found Footage sucks everything, and sucked a infinity more times after. None of these movies done this way are never good. I hated them since 'The Blair Witch Project'. TBWP is or was so over hyped and overrated, its pathetic.Okay, what really ticked me off was the preview looked great. I did not see it in the theater, which is a plus. I and my mother waited to watch the DVD, which was bad idea. Started all shaky, and we were like 'what the crap is this'. We continued to watch and still shaky camera. It never stopped once. Holy Mary F***** God and Christ. Could not tell what was going on. Monsters you can't see. Someone talking you can't see.Characters running from something you can't see. Can you say boring? Yes, I can. This reminded me how much The Blair Witch Project sucked. I am one of the people that thinks the sequel to The Blair Witch Project was better. At least normal camera is done right. This shaky camera crap can be done, just give the camera to an infant and strap them in front of an actor, and you got the same crap. It is stupid.This is just as annoying as the TV broadcasters putting reality shows on TV. Man nothing is getting done right anymore. No original movies or TV shows anymore. If Cloverfield 2 ever come to a release, I would not go near any theater that has it. I will just wait until its out of the theater, then go see a movie that is heck of a lot better. Stupid Found Footage crap.",1,1,3,22 January 2014
Cloverfield," What is wrong with people?
","This movie and all found footage crap, is just that CRAP! This had very terrible acting. It was not scary. It was hard to watch in the first place, and that is why found footage sucks. The director cheapens the movie for this reason to make a quick buck. People fall for this crap. Nothing at all that people praise about these movies are correct. Just like smokers making excuses to keep smoking.Waste of money. Glad I never went to the theater to see it. PG-13 so called horror, are not scary in the first place. Just a bunch of noise to make you jump, and that is it. To see this still up at 7 rating is pathetic, that people rate this crap higher than the better movies. This site is still messed up with ratings. They are never going to fix it.The only spoiler of this movie I am going to say is it has massive amount of shaky camera that is really no need for it at all. Ruins the whole movie.",1,1,5,3 September 2018
Bird Box," What is wrong with people?
","This was way better than The Happening! I just watched it, and it may be long to watch but kept me watching through the whole thing and still was decent paced through it, and not that boring at all. Just because you guys have a mind that wonders around besides thinking what is going on, does not make this a bad movie, but you just stupid enough to not enjoy it and keep your thoughts on it, while it is going.The eyes on them after going crazy reminded me of In The Mouth Of Madness when they went crazy. This kind of remind of that movie to me. Still the same as The Happening but a heck of a lot better than that movie. I would definitely be saying this is better to anyone that asks about it, and recommend it. I read a review before watching saying people that rate this high is stupid but that person is the dummie.I think this is one of my favorites and would watch it if put on regular television. Not sure if they put Netflix movies on television but I would not mind if this was the first one. It is that good to me, and I usually am not one to like mellow horror movies, but this is my first to like a lot. I will give it the highest recommendation, and the hype is real too. I like following this hype.This is a better hype than TBWP. Found footage sucks. Sorry, if you are offended but it does. Watch this instead.",10,1,10,6 January 2019
The Village," Not as good as everyone makes it....None of PG-13
","Has a few jolts, and that is it leaving you like why in hell did that happen. It also leaves you at the end wondering, why? Well, I saw it in the theater and left not wanting to see it ever again. Signs movie is just as bad.No this is not a horror movie. It even says on this site it is a mystery, thriller. That right there just tells me if I did not see it that it is not that good. PG-13 thrillers can't hack the scares. If you are scared, then you must not get out that much. If you rate this movie high then you probably do not see that many movies often. If you want a real movie see Hatchet II or the original Hatchet. This one is just boring.",1,0,3,19 February 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," Animations are violent!
","If I had kids I would not let them watch most of the cartoons or animation movies. It has been said a lot that these kind of movies or even cartoons on TV on Saturday are teaching kids to be violent and be more of troublemakers. This is why kids bully other kids. This is why we have terrorists. Sorry, whoever wants to say whatever about this. I would keep my kids away. When they are not old enough to know not to do what a movie shows, then they should not be watching. Everything is an example to kids when they are young.Why do they follow their parents when they are young?, because they are the examples. I got out of watching these things when I was around 8.",Null,0,2,31 July 2011
The Conjuring 2," So Sad that People Like this
","First one hated and regretting seeing it, then I see the sequel knowing that the first one sucked, this one has to, too. It was exactly as I thought. First one was considered R rated for scares alone, and there was not one scary part in it. Like a TV-14 movie from TV got put on the big screen.As for the first paragraph about this one, is the same. No difference on rating. Must of been a teenager hired to preview the movie before released to get the rating for it. Now, they rated R, but really should be TV-14 rating.People actually got scared off these two movies? Annabelle was spin off the first and was not even scary, and had more gore than both of these two together and did not get scary. What is wrong with directors and producers now a days?Both Sinister movies was hell of a lot better than all Annabelle's and The Conjuring movies. They are not making any more sequels to the Sinister movies. That is a shame. I rather see many, many more sequels of Sinister movies, than this crap.These two movies put shame to the R ratings. Blasphemy is what this is. No recommendation as for horror movies to watch.",1,2,8,17 August 2017
District 9," Crap! Crap! Crap! and more Crap!
","This is the most worst movie around. Me and my mother was going to watch this on DVD. OK we got it in and all we saw was news cast. How terrible this is we said to each other. It jumped scenes like crazy. We turned it off after hearing about the prostitute aliens.It is a documentary, and who in the heck thinks a movie is a documentary. Someone thought that this would make it original and better than any movie around. Just the opposite. Hell this is SO bad we turned it off I think 15 to 20 into the movie. I could not even keep track of what was supposed to be going on.Maybe this is so high rated, because people that watch documentaries and love them, love this piece of crap. Now a days the ratings on here are over rated. Anything to get someone to waste their money on crap.I can tell you what to do with this movie, and it is pretty predictable of what I would tell you. I will anyways. Do not..I say do not, see this unless you wanted to ruin the length of movie of your life and shove money down the toilet and drain.Really, its that bad. I thought sling-blade was bad when I left the theater, because I fell asleep during it. That is the only movie I left theater. This one I saw on DVD, and still did not even get a half hour of it without turning it off. It might of got off the news casting, but I do not want to wait until the movie is almost over to see if it gets better.It got worse every second it was playing. This movie is for people that maybe on drugs or have no life to waste. If they show this on broadcast TV, I will change the channel.Good luck to the morons that like this utterly crap of a movie.",1,3,11,12 December 2010
Man on the Moon," What? This is Funny?
","The whole thing is stupid, and not funny at all. Any one can act stupid. It is Jim Carey getting paid to be stupid. Still a very boring movie. The actor on Taxi was better, than Jim Carey.I can't watch the whole movie, because its so boring. The guy can barely make a good impression on his audience, and they made such a big deal about him dying at the end.The guys first act was completely rude to everyone, and was not even funny at all. Barely see any smiling from any of the actors through out the movie. Where do they come up with this stuff? This movie can not be rated 7.4. There is nothing on it that makes it that good. I swear people that rate this high obviously must be doing the exact make themselves look like fools to make people laugh, and think it is funny.Most of the comedy movies is just whacked out stupid things that people do to get attention, and then put it out on a movie for others to see.At least dumb and dumber was funny. This is not. This is more him making an complete a** out of himself.",1,7,17,15 May 2013
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Hilarious but stupid hilarious
","Not all being stupid is hilarious but this is stupid. Just like being stupid is funny but some mixed with horror is good or the best. This one is mediocre with the mix. It is like watching Friends with horror added, which is not a great mix. So five stars for adding both together, which makes this film kind of stupid. You either have to be drunk or on dope to think this is the best film. I do not like or enjoy crude or rude dumb films.I gave it a five stars because at least is not actual crude or rude humor. I love horror movies but this humor is stupid to be with a horror movie. The Evil Dead movies are better than this. Those are actually funnier. If the characters act like they are not even graduated from high school kind of intelligence, then they are pretty much stupid, even if they are paid to act that way.",5,2,7,9 March 2018
Get Out," What the....?
","OMG! People liked this? I don't care if this is more a thriller than a horror movie. It was unbearably slow, and even when it got to the end with the killing people to get away, it was too fast to be even a horror with the gore. It left many questions to WTF? I don't care if others love these kind of movies that just are so deep that make you think to be a great movie. I think if you have to hurt your head just to understand it, then it is a terrible movie, not great. I have no problem with black and white relationships. I am white or Caucasian.I do have a problem with director not making his movie clearly easy to understand like this one. 3/4 movie is just waste, and the end is just like, 'what the..., is this?' 7.7 rating is way too high. Sorry, but I am more into violence and gore fan.This is slight gore, and slight violence. The only reason for an R is the language, the rest is just blah. Cut the language to one F word, and you got a PG-13 movie here. I do not care if they say it is based on a black guy interpretation. It is not that good at all.I saw heck of a lot more better movies than this. Not a more than once watch for me at all.",1,5,16,23 November 2017
Drive," Total crap!
","I would put lower than 1, if I could. I went and saw this. I did expect some car chases and cool racing, but to find it was only very limited in that department.First off started very slow. I was expecting action to turn more into crime. Not much action at all. Where is the romance that people are talking about? Non at all. If you call driving around town in a car not looking at each other, and not saying a word to each other romantic, then something is wrong with you.For this movie if you wanted, I bet you could count the amount of words said in it without losing track of the count. That is how much talking is in it. I take this movie as more of fancy closeups of Ryan Gosling.Man there were at least 3 very slow pauses in this movie, like did this movie freeze? LOL! That is how bad this movie was.I am almost done. One thing that bugs me and make no sense at all. The driver is a stunt man for Hollywood, and know nothing about killing anyone. I guy he knows hired him as a mechanic in a shop, and got him a job as a stunt man in movies.He does some driver for some people at beginning while there robbing a store, and gets away leaving the robbers in a parking garage for a mall or something. What is the problem with this movie is it turns into he finds out he stuck in a situation with the mob.This mob are professional killers for years. All of a sudden Ryan Gosling is a professional killer and kill all the professional mobster killers like there are not professional killers in a mobster killing way that mobsters do it. I was like WTH.This movie is bass ackwards. What I mean by it is rooting for the bad guys to survive by Ryan Gosling. LOL! How stupid is that. If you do watch this, I would rather tell you exactly what it is like before hand, so you at least are knowing how bad it is and decide if you really want to see how crappy it is.I do not recommend seeing it. It is your choice of wasting about 2 hours of your life.",Null,5,13,24 September 2011
Insidious," PG-13 says it!
","Not voting because I won't see it. I don't understand how anyone can say PG-13 horror are horror. If no gore then its a immediately a thriller not horror. Horror in definition has gore. So this is not an officially a horror movie.Stop with the horror PG-13 lies. I watch so many of these false claimed horror flicks, that I only see horror if its R or Unrated now. Sorry, these knock offs are about as good as Poltergeist, which is now not really scary anymore. So people out claiming this is scary is weird. Just because the music gets louder and a big loud noise does not make it scary.I been so disappointed with the media lately with PG-13 horror that they not worth the 1 and half to 2 hours of watching. A few that I thought for an example as terrible is Others, The Fog remake, The Skeleton Key, Signs, The Village, Sixth Sense, and a lot more are bad.If your looking for a diet version of horror movie, this is one for you. For me I do not need a diet or light version of horror movie to see. They are just no way scary at all.The people that are saying this review is not good are probably girl screaming boys or teenager girls that go to PG-13 horror movies to scream at every single loud noise in theaters to annoy anyone that is sitting around them. A normal adult would call this movie dumb. I actually took the chance to watch this and find out I was right this whole time. It sucks like all PG-13 horror claiming trash. Heck, this might be worse than Poltergeist, but I can not even watch that anymore. Not very many horror so called horror even Rated R or Unrated are even scary, but at least the gore gives something more interesting to see, than this crap. If I attempt to watch another PG-13 so called cheated horror flick I will shoot or some how kill myself first.Do not. I repeat. Do not, see this trash. I can not believe James Wan made this after Dead Silence. If he does not redeem himself with a R horror, then he went down with all the Directors that went to PG-13 too. I will never end the complaining with these trashy movies.",1,1,11,3 June 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Wolves are wolves, not werewolves, PERIOD!
","I give a 1, because I would not see any of the twilights. I am here putting this because of the Summary (title) of this review. I will not see this at all. It is sad when people start making wolves into werewolves when they are not. I seen the preview of this movie and it was a turn off just because of the wolves thing. A werewolf attack someone that person attacked turns into one them self if they survive the attack, but an attack from a wolf they die. They are not the same thing. Wolves are real, and werewolves are not.Anyone that knows about werewolves and wolves know they are not the same. This is just to show how lame and stupid people really are. The movie with jack Nicholson as Wolf, was not even a werewolf movie. It was him turning into a wolf. So quit the stupid movies that you think you make anything up to get people to watch and make money off of it. I will not watch stupid movies.As far as this being a chick flick. I say it is. I do not watch them, and I will not go sit and listen to teenage girls make their noises when seeing a movie or even pay for the movie to hear them in the background. It is annoying as it is with PG-13 horror with any teenager screaming in the background when it is not even scary. I do not see how there could even be fans of this. It is terrible even from the first preview of the first movie. They said the reason near dark never got a remake was because of this crap.I would of seen that remake of Near Dark over this crap any day. At least Near Dark was better.I do not recommend these movies and never will watch them even if I was drugged. I would kill myself first.",1,5,9,20 March 2011
Event Horizon," What is wrong with people?
","This should be higher rating than 6.7, and Roger Ebert sucks big ones. This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. Who would listen to him anyways? Jeez, people are dumb. People get paid to be dumb? Yeppers!!!!Once, you hear the mission, they in for it until the end. I would of loved a sequel of this movie but it is way so late and many years later, a remake would be done. I probably still love this one after a remake. I like some remakes, that people complain about on their own. I would love to see more movies like this one.Instead we are getting The Conjuring movies and spin offs that are not even scary, and people saying they are. Pffft! I laugh at those people. I could watch this one many, many times over again, and still have no issues of seeing it. People are nuts if they rate this low.",10,2,3,2 January 2019
Evil Dead," Awesome for Gore fans!!!!
","I really don't get the so called claiming of some of these horror fans. If they are really horror fans, then the gore should not bother them at all. I can't believe the reviews, that I am reading here. This is one of the best horror movies. An instant classic just for the gore. This just reminds me of how good 'The Dawn of the Dead' 2004 remake was good. These people rating it low, and saying they are horror fans, and complaining are the PG-13 wanna be horror fans.True horror fans are the rated R or Unrated movie watchers. If they can't handle it, then stay in the PG-13 groups that will never be true horror fans. I saw the viewing of the first in theater last night, and there were so many clapping and laughing at the over the top gore, and that is great. I am mind boggled at the stupidity of people tearing this masterpiece apart just for the heck of it, and also other masterpieces, and giving the crappy PG-13 ones better ratings.Learn the rules of horror, and PG-13 is not the rule of horror. Directors that do PG-13 for horror, just can't think of anything good to make the fans excited. I recommend this movie to everyone that is the true horror fans, not the fake wanna be crappy PG-13 fans that are lame, and make up excuses to not see it, because of the gore.",10,17,78,5 April 2013
Paranormal Activity," Couldn't even watch half of it
","If I had a choice to vote negative I would. I watch almost half of the movie then turned it off. This is the kind of movie that you sit and sit and sit, hoping well where is the good stuff? I never got to it. I was SO bored. I just turned it off and got rid of the movie.This movie has shaky camera crap like The Lame Blair Witch Project. Yes you heard me. LAME! I really see no way in hell that shaky camera has anything to do with scary at all. Nothing, Nada, zip. People with this no gore is scarier than gory movies is what a teenager that sneaks into rated R or higher movies or has parents rent them that go on video.PG13 and I will say this until I die are crap no horror claimed to be horror, actually a thriller movie that have no scare at all. Anyone that says that they are better at all is that you know needs medical help. I will not watch this one or any of the sequels.This is crap directors trying to make any money they can no matter what it is or how crappy it is. I do not support shaky camera movies at all. I do not recommend seeing any of them. I do not get sick watching them it is stupid to not really see what the heck is going on because someone can't handle a camera.If they are professional, then hold the camera right. A freaking kid can shake a camera. Does that make the kid a professional? Oh and this movie is only rated R for Language. I seen no other thing than that in first half of this movie.",1,2,4,20 October 2011
Don't Breathe," Not more than a 7 but great!
","This is not a horror movie, that it claims to be. This is more a suspense, thriller, kind of movie. Really, not scary at all, and if people are rating it for that, then they are nuts. It is more intense and suspenseful, than being a horror or scary movie.This is about 3 friends that are partners in robbing homes. Yes, I said friends because another review said Money was a boyfriend of Rocky, which is not at all true. They were just closer than Alex, that got a hold of his fathers keys.Money hears about a new job that makes a lot of money, but they made a pact, not to go for money, but this time it was different, and Alex was skeptical about it and then gave in. They found out this veteran and being blind man, would be an easy job.Turns out that it was not as easy as they thought and it turned out to be two of them killed and one escaping with the money at the end. Not going to say, but you will probably already figure it out, by me just saying that.Anyways, this is definitely not a horror movie at all. Not as much as The Purge was. This is just trying to get out of the house and not make a sound at all kind of movie. Nothing like The Collector either.I read another review that compared to Sinister, but nothing like that either. Horror is usually something supernatural or evil to be a horror movie. This is nothing like that. So don't go in thinking it is.I was not disappointed for not being like a horror movie, but loved it as what it was, and that is suspenseful, thriller movie. I recommend to go see it and enjoy it. I did, and I would watch it again if it went on television.This kind of movie that would be great on broadcast television. I went on Tuesday that is $5 and worth that too, and probably worth more if I went on another day.",7,0,5,30 August 2016

He then is walking down the highway with cars abandoned on the highway, and he notices a truck coming towards him, and he hides behind a car. When the truck pulls up by Columbus, he ducks behind a motorcycle with his rifle ready to shoot who ever steps out of the truck, thinking it might be a zombie driving it. This is when he finally meets Tallahasee. His new partner in zombie killing. Tallahasee lets Columbus in the truck and drive off.

After a while they run back into the teenager and sister again and get held up again. This time they are traveling together. They all finally grow on each other and stay with each other until the end. They get to Beverly Hills. The rest you can figure out on your own. It is the most fun and funniest movie I seen in years. I am keeping this movie for life.I love zombie movies. It beats Sean of the Dead, and some of the zombie movies. I would recommend this one for anyones collection.

I have watched many movies that are scarier than this and people in reviews are calling this creepy and scary. The only weird part of the movie is the rape scene of the devil with her.The rest of the movie is pure drama, with a little comedy. This makes you laugh more than get scared at all. Nothing close to what people call horror. It boggles my mind that you all call this great when I could easily fall asleep during it.I don't mind watching if nothing else is on television but to call this a horror movie is a little too much. Just because it has no gore, it is better. Hogwash, and pathetic. Violence is better than just sitting around hoping something happens and it doesn't.Like this movie nothing happens except that scene she gets raped by the devil. Only part that got interesting and then boring through the rest. Rosemary is ugly too. How anyone could think she is hot or anything is beyond me. She is white, almost dead white.Skinny is not beautiful at all. Look at most models now a days. Toothpicks. Stick figure women is what I thought when watching her in this movie and that other movie she is in, is terrible too. People sitting around talking throughout the whole movie is not entertaining.To each their own on liking this one. It is just a time waster to me. They do show it on television when nothing good is on, and that does not mean this is a great movie either. Just because it is rating an 8.0 does not mean a thing.Go ahead and say you enjoyed it. I did not but it is bad when there is nothing else to watch.",1,9,29,21 March 2017
The Conjuring," Really People? No True Horror Fan on these good reviews.
","I got to say this. What is wrong with you all? Saying this movie is one of the best. Holy **** it was bad and slow. It had no scares at all, no gore, no swearing, no nudity. It was like watching a television movie as TV-14 rating on big screen. With the loud noises that were supposed to be scary was not scary at all, that I could of slept with it going on. It was nothing compared to the exorcist. It was terrible. What did all the underage kids sneak into the theater to see this and gave it great reviews? I swear you guys are nuts to say this was that good. James Wan other movies were better than this. I am starting to think all of these reviews are fake.This should of been a thriller genre. There are thrillers that are scarier than this movie. This was like most terrible movie that could be in the horror genre. Boggles my mind that people think this is scary, just as bad as people thought the Blair witch project was rated good for swearing and running around the woods through the whole movie. We got a nutty world who thinks these movie are great or just teenagers sneaking into rated so called R movies. Surprised I am the only true horror fan that did not like this. The is basically paranormal activity 5 and probably copy of it or is it.Don't like putting people down, but you guys need to check on your brains. Something in there is telling you something wrong. Will not recommend this to anyone. Dead Silence was better, and that was lame too. Insidious was about barely better than this one, but a sliver chance. Thought the world was going bad, but a 7+ rating on this movie on this site just says how bad this site is for reviews. Heck, half or more reviews per movie is not even selected a vote for it, so that movie basically does not get the ratings they deserve or don't deserve.This site is so bad that you can't trust anyone that says how they feel about a movie, because of all these reviews for this movie on this site. I think zombies ate their brains for dinner, and they came to see this awe full piece of trash. This is not hype for this movie, it is just dumb people that know nothing of what is good, except they probably watch TV movies all the time and compare this one to them. Oh well, guess the horror movies are going to just keep getting worse and not better, and its because of these terrible reviews of saying it is the best. I am so glad I went to see You're Next. It was heck of a lot better than this movie could ever be. Heck, The Blair Witch Project had things that were more chance of being rated R, than this movie. It was in the terrible list of horror movies too.These reviews have to be teenagers sneaking in the theater to see this. No in hell way is this that good. Even the dumbest person would know this sucks that bad. Yes, I am calling you all stupid with the good reviews. Screaming teenagers that scream during a non screaming part in the movie in the theater. Lame as heck, and annoying to those trying to see if there is something worth getting out of these terrible movies.I do not support James Wan in any of his movies anymore or go see them at the theater anymore, and I really hope others will follow me in this decision too.Wow, there is still good reviews of this movie. What is even scary in this movie? I have not read one good review, that actually saying what is scary in it. It is not. Scary is no vocabulary in this movie. It is the biggest borefest or snorefest or sleepfest.Now that I got to throw up reading these reviews saying its a great movie. Nothing believable from any of the reviews on this site anymore. People just don't from good or bad any more. This site may have a lot of visitors, but it is badly taken care of with so many bad reviews, and I don't mean bad as bad for the most part. I mean good reviews for bad movies, and bad reviews for good movies. I know people have their own opinion of what is good and bad, but come on. What is all the reviews for this movie from? 6 year olds? The reviews that are rated good for this movie is going to bring out another bad movie from James Wan. This shows he is good at bringing out bad movies, which should not even be happening.At least Saw was interesting and horror. The rest of his were down right the worst of his directing career. Any one that thinks taking out gore, nudity, and swearing, makes a great movie, then stay a child and be childish all the time, because that is what this movies are made for.This movie right here on this site is going to ruin the whole concept of movies altogether for everyone. We will keep seeing PG-13 so called horror movies that aren't horror, and we will see more rated R movies, that should never be rated R, because MPAA keeps doing that stupid its scary, when it isn't ratings for movies.The MPAA needs to go back to school and relearn what ratings is. This world is going to crumble down, and IMDb will start it off with this movie on this site.",1,17,50,19 July 2013
The Sixth Sense," Good but not that good
","PG-13 horror. Oh wait a minute this is more like a thriller. It was not really scary at all. Why is it considered horror? Barely anything to consider it horror. Only thing going for it is the actors. The rest is not that good. If you watch this for scares, then you have to be young.There is no way this could bother a true horror fan. Yes, true horror fan watches anything rated R or Unrated. So yes, gore is the way to true horror happiness. No I don't do the things I watch on the big screen. Its just better to watch something interesting, than to watch something you will fall asleep in.Luckily this has Bruce Willis in it to keep you interesting, but if he wasn't in it, then I probably say it was really bad, and only give it a 1 on the vote. 5 is for Bruce Willis. I only like it, because I was not the one who chose to rent it.",5,0,4,25 June 2013
The Purge," Not a good concept as you would think
","I bothers me that you would think in this movie that the government would actually think it would keep the crime down with a purge like that. Legalizing crime for 12 hours a year. That is the dumbest thing any one could think of. That is like starting an Apocalypse. To me that reason for doing the purge is not cleansing the earth, its causing the earth to collapse in crime all at once, once a year for 12 hours. 12 hours the authorities are on break or vacation while people are killing and murdering others, and doing all manners of crime.I can understand that this is a movie, and it would never happen or will it. Will the government actually get an idea from this movie and do it? I would rather end my own life, before they ever do something as stupid as this. I give this a 7 out of 10, because of the stupid concept, that kind of ruined the movie as a horror movie. So now there will be a sequel of the next years purge. I don't know who actually came up with this story, but it is awful story line for a horror. Sinister is better than this. Terrible reviews that are saying this is the worst.I did not like the concept they came up with, but it was a good watch. I will watch anything that has a lot of action. It is just that idea sounds stupid. That people actually think its a good concept or say it is, is going to give the government more stupid ideas to actually do this. I hope they don't, because we won't last long if this actually happens. Each year with this going on would make only last a few years of this world being here. That is a lot of killing, and I don't see how that much killing could cleanse the earth. Must be Jehovah Witnesses that believe only 144,000 will be saved, that come up with this story. Kill everyone so only that many is left. How can they say that 144,000 will be saved, when they got billions of members? That right there just contradicts their religion. They must of been drunk when creating the religion. If they do a purge at all it should be the end of the world purge. All out kill each other until we are all dead. No one lives. Not one soul. The only way to do it is just gas the whole earth. Massive poisonous gas released, and movie is just people trying to stop it from happening. That would be better.See this would be a great concept and horror movie: Very big and tall business building with lots of people working. Seems like a normal day at work, and everything getting done. A very new security system of the future is installed. It some how gets hacked from the outside and is on lock down, but some of those people that hacked it planned on having hundreds of people that work with them are kept inside, and are there to murder, rape, and kill anyone that is in the building, even if they kill their own people that are in there. That would be one massive killing spree of horror. All out count the bodies as the go great horror movie. To bad we can't get something like that.The only problem with this movie the purge is that it was only all about the family. Did not really give us the full concept of the world doing it. You just have to imagine it happening else where, which is lame. People that say gore should not be in horror movie is lame. Gore is part of horror, and when you take it out, then the movie is lame. If the movie is lame, then the people that like it and rate it high is lame. They can't handle much if they can't handle the gore.Tired of the PG-13 horror is better than the rated R and unrated horror. They aren't and never will be, because we the people that are true horror fans of horror can enjoy and handle it. The ones that can't are either anyone under 18 or adults that are just babies, and just put their heads between their legs and cry. So sick of people defending the PG-13 horror movies. They are pretty much just light versions of true horror, that should be called Thrillers in the first place, because thrillers are actually scarier than the PG-13 horror. Cheap thrills from PG-13 horror.Get a clue directors of horror. Get the real horror. True life of this world is horror. Seeing is believing. The real stuff is what scares people and PG-13 stuff is just more fake, than any rated R or unrated horror. Anything from the 80's horror stuff is better than today's horror movies. They need to come out with originals not remakes or reboots. Sorry, if this is long, but I need to make it long to get rid of all these terrible reviews. People have no idea what bad is until they seen a PG-13 horror movie.To end this, horror is for fun, and gore just helps that fun.",10,1,5,8 June 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," The Best Movie Ever for Horror!!..What a bunch of terrible reviews saying it sucks...What you been smokin? Not Us.
","The ones that are smokin are the ones that say this movie sucks or is bad or worst movie ever. Probably the people that think PG-13 horror is the movies to see. What the? That is why they are PG-13, is because its for 13 and under, DUH! Man you are stupid bunch of turds.Simple fact that people over 13 and are adults are not really grown up yet if they think a PG-13 is scary. You need to get out more. So F*cking lame that people say those are better than these kind of movies or rated R and Unrated ones.I personally think that all the bad reviews of this movie, those people probably have a stash of the movie somewhere to watch on their own time, because they get bullied by others if they like the movie, and sounds just like kids, and what they would do is bully others. They actually love the movie, but instead of bullied, they come on this site and say it sucks so no one would know they actually love it.I am not scared of anyone knowing I love the movie. I would actually recommend it. I am not going to take some stupid crap from others saying its a bad or worst horror movie or say its not even a horror, when it is. Also for those saying its not horror, its just gore, and horror is not gore is just stupid too.Look up the definition of horror dummies. It says gore or disgust is in the definition. Most of the people that tear movies down are the child. Children are the ones or wimps that say PG-13 is better than the rated R or Unrated horror movies, and are not the true horror fans that watch them and love them. They should not be called fans of horror in no way at all.Anyone over the age of 13 and watches those PG-13 horror wanna be horror movies and screams like a teenager girl even if they are male, are just plain need to taught how to be a man, and stop playing with dolls. Get out of you closet and be the man you should be.Same goes for all the bad reviews of this movie.What really is stupid too, is the fact there are people that review on this site and never use the rating at all. Dumb as anything could be for that. Really, you know if you don't rate the movie, that it won't affect the rating at all, up or down. It does nothing to it. That is how stupid you people are for not rating it.This is going to be my longest review ever, because these bad reviews from dumb *sses are that stupid.Keep smokin it up like Marty and saying this movie sucks.One thing I did not like is minor was just the way it started slow. Yes, I like fast and gory get to the killing people off movies in horror. This actually started off slow. Hate me for that all you want.Once they pick their rooms in the cabin though and that dare game it picked up nicely. For those that say this was the same as 'The Evil Dead', its not. Different buy a lot. The scene where Curt and Jules were going to start going at it was great in the woods. It was kind of little slow even when they started being killed off one by one, by the Redneck Zombies.Marty was dumb and smart, which is kind of dumb, but was sort of funny. The way they were killed off was funnier than Marty. My best part of the movie is when Marty and Dana go into the elevator, and see all the horror characters on the elevators rotating, and they unleash them to keep them from being shot by the swat team.Once they were all released, the evil characters from other horror movies was a blood splatter fest. People that say this movie is gory is the ones that probably left the movie before it got to that point. Would be awesome if they made this movie Unrated. It would never happen.The cameo appearance of the actress from Aliens, and Ghost Busters was a little off, but fit at the end fine. All in all, this was one of the best horror flicks out there, and heck of a lot better than any PG-13 so called horror movie, that should actually be called 'Thrillers'.I recommend this movie to anyone, but there are haters out there no matter where you go.",10,0,5,13 November 2013
