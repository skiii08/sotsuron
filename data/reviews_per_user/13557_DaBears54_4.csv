Gremlins," A great throwback thrillomedy
",This movie was one of the most thought out movies that was a comedy yet was a horror movie too. I had a Gizmo doll when I was a kid. This brings up a funny freaky story. When I received the gift as a kid I wrote on the tush tag my initials DAC.We are talking maybe 17 years ago. 5 years later I got too old to have it so I sold it at a yard sale my family ran. It was sold for 10 cents. I completely forgot about it until about a year ago I went into this store that carried classic toys. I went in there to look for some old Beanie Babies. I was browsing the persons showcases and I come across a gizmo doll. I asked him if I could see it he takes it out and I am looking over the doll and something caught my attention on his tush tag in Magic Marker which I used to write DAC was those initials. I just fell out in tears and shock saying this was mine I received 16 years ago and I wrote those initials on it so I bought him back for 5 dollars. So now that doll and movie is my favorite thing I own.,Null,0,1,24 July 2003
Happy Gilmore," One of his greatest movies ever
",I just recently seen this movie even though it's been out for about 8 years. And I'm telling you this is one of Adam Sandlers greatest movies ever. I rank this movie as his 3rd best ever in my opinion. Big Daddy comes in 2nd and the Water Boy is my favorite Sandler Movie. Many great actors have made their great career starts on SNL. SNL is like the ED Sullivan show for comedians who want to get their starts. And Adam is just another one of those great actors. Will Ferrell is another actor ready to take his acting into the movie world.,8,2,2,26 December 2003
Elf," An instant classic
","Elf will be one of those movies that is going to be an instant classic, next to great movies such as A Christmas Story, and Its a Wonderful life. This was a great movie. It had me laughing throughout most of the movie. So before or after you do your Christmas shopping go see this movie because you will love it.",10,1,3,21 November 2003
The Shining," I disagree with the user tfrizzel's review or comments
","This is one of Stephen King's best movies ever. It is definitly one of the top 100 movies of all time. A typical Nicholson masterpiece. The remake was a great movie as well. Not a lot of comedian actors like Steven Weber can pull off an act like he did in the remake. But good old Jack was the best Jack Torrence. Weber was good but not as good as Nicholson. Rebecca DeMorney played a better Wendy in my opinion than Shelley Duvall. Danny Lloyd was a better Doc than Courtland Mead. I liked Melvin Van Peebles and Scatman Crothers equally as Halloren. Elliott Gould and Barry Nelson played 2 diffrent personalities of Mr. Ullman. Gould was a SOB and Nelson played a nice Ullman. That questioned my thoughts about the character. The lady in the haunted room in the remake was creepier than the original. I liked Pat Hingle's role in the movie remake as Mr. Watson. I'm a Pat Hingle fan so that was cool to see him in it. I had the honor to meet him when I was in Colorado a couple years ago since he is from Colorado. I visited the Stanley Hotel where the remake was made and he along with Courtland Mead and Elliott Gould made a guest apperance at the Hotel. They were doing a special tour of the hotel. All cool people. So my rating of the movie 4 stars out of 4, and for the remake 3 out of 4 stars.",Null,0,1,4 January 2004
