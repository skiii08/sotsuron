The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The Hunger Games: Effie!
","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a fine film. That's pretty much it. It's fine.I have probably adored the film more than most, yet I can clearly see what they are struggling with. Although the movie does not progress as boringly as some mention, I agree that it is unnecessarily slow-pacing. The book itself is not 'full of events' enough like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to be made into two films, which makes this decision look like nothing more than a greed for money.I don't think unneeded scenes were added to make the plot look longer, but the events going on - e.g. the first, second and the thousandth propaganda shots - were less essential, worth being sacrificed for the greater good, as done in the previous instalments.What is appealing to me is once again the scenes added, which are pretty impossible to be in a book from a first person perspective but look great in an action movie. The Gamemaking technology and the conversations between the Head Gamemakers and President Snow were now replaced by 'countermoves' from various districts and these scenes not witnessed by Katniss in the book - also the rescue mission in the Capitol - kept the movie alive as far as it goes.Despite District 13 being nothing close to the underground city I had imagined, it is probably the fault of my imagination inaccurately picturing somewhere more disciplined and somehow flawless, closer to the Capitol.The acting was nothing special, as more touching scenes still look a bit fake on both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. I cannot say the same for Liam Hemsworth, as the director is a huge Peenis fangirl and there has occurred nothing worth mentioning about Gale in the entire film series.Apart from the main characters, I found Alma Coin quite accurate; although it was not the Coin I imagined, it felt right. Haymitch did not have enough screen time and Plutarch was seldom active. The movie being depicted to the late actor Philip Seymour Hoffman literally gave me the goosebumps. May he rest in peace.To sum it all up, the movie does not promise anything not awaited, yet it is far away from 'bad'. It has got 4 extra points from me just by bringing lovely Effie back in spite of that evil Collins woman. Long live Effie!",7,11,34,22 November 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-Men Origins: Mystique
","Here we have another X-Men movie with Wolverine in the centre. Oops, I misspelled Mystique! Do not get me wrong; I love Mystique. I adore her at an extreme level and always liked how essential of a role she had in the trilogy, yet I do not think that she is THIS important of a character.I also like Jennifer Lawrence and her performance as Katniss Everdeen a lot, but I have never agreed on how she is the right choice for this part. She is a pretty woman, but not drop-dead gorgeous. Mystique is a femme fatale; she is sexy as hell and deadly and frightening all at the same time. Romijn has that spirit, Lawrence does not.Another reason why Mystique becomes the protagonist of the film is the misuse of other characters. Wolverine is supposed to be the main character here, considering that Shadowcat's own story was changed to make Wolverine get the spotlight once again, but he is like Wasp amongst the Avengers: useless. He has no important role except for the 'physically-strong-thingy' and is lame from the first second of the film till the last one.You thought less important X-Men like Kitty Pryde or Colossus had unsatisfactory screen time in the previous instalments? Watch this one. Kitty gets wounded in spite of her ability, Colossus can be seen being smashed by a Sentinel time to time, Bishop looks like he is in a Hallowe'en costume, Sunspot is a fusion of Human Torch and Sunfire, Warpath acts like a regular warrior except for his 'Elf eyes' scene, and Blink and Blink only can be defined splendid.Let's not forget the best one of course: Quicksilver! Despite my prejudice, he was perhaps the best X-Men character ever to be on the white screen. 'The scene' was just incontrovertibly spectacular. If Avengers: Age of Ultron nails it half as much, that will be a great movie.Now stop taking me seriously and go see how horrible Beast's make-up still is and how awful Mystique's has become. Do not miss Ms. Darkholme's Matrix fighting style and try taking a tequila shot every single time Stewart, McKellen or Berry has a scene. You will not leave the theatre drunk, believe me.PS: Wait for the scene at the end of the credits for the next X-Men villain. Do not bother to waste your time if your knowledge of superheroes end with the movies.",9,0,2,23 May 2014
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," After all this time?
","I have been counting days for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them since the moment it was announced. I was so anxious when the plot they revealed was just about Newt losing his creatures and capturing them again, as it sounded too shallow. After the first few trailers, we saw that there was a bigger picture and I began getting high hopes.I cannot say I was disappointed. After the film, I sat and stared at the wall for hours, not saying anything but just thinking about the film. The major new element that J.K. has added to her world had hit me so hard, yet after thinking about the film as a whole, and how shocking the revelations such as 'Horcruxes' and 'wand owner issues' were at the beginning and how they turned out to be, I started becoming satisfied. It was breathtaking and connecting the phenomenon with an important character we already know and will take place in the pentalogy *no spoilers* enlightened me.Apart from the greater plot, the beasts were FANTASTIC. I could not believe how every single one of them made me want one of them, as some were not even supposed to be cute but were. I was so satisfied with how much they added to the descriptions in the book, in terms of both looks and attributes.I disagree with everyone who thought the characters were paper-thin. They made me associate with them (e.g., Newt's introvert personality, Tina's struggles, Jacob's dreams) and I liked all more than I thought I would.The CGI was quite nice, except for Frank the Thunderbird and Gnarlak the Goblin, as I saw it in IMAX 3D. Because it was already revealed, I feel free to say that Johnny Depp was actually worse than I expected, as it looked like Grindelwald was Johnny Depp and unfortunately not the other way round.Being a Potterhead as far as it goes, I terribly enjoyed the film without watching it as a hardcore fan but as a critic. Don't hesitate to make inappropriate sounds in the middle of the theatre when the Warner Bros. logo appears (not me or anything, just what a friend of mine did...), for THE MAGIC CLEARLY NEVER ENDS.",10,35,69,19 November 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Spider-Man 3? Is that you?
","I am quite a fan of Marvel in general, including the web-slinging hero, yet I have never been amazed enough by the so-called 'Amazing' Spider-Man movies.In spite of the fact that I think of Garfield as a by far better Peter Parker than Maguire, I was pretty disappointed about the first film, with the newly-born Spider-Man not recognised enough by the public and news, and the lame scene where he got shot and dramatised it for over five minutes.These little but essential problems were solved in this one, though it did not feel good either, because they developed way too fast. Considering that Spider-Man always has to fight against the prejudice and misunderstanding of the public and the news, along with his nemeses, it was ridiculous of the public to stand there not frightened, and cheer for the web-slinger after his 'also amazing' harangue to convince Dillon.Dillon was supposed to make us feel sorry for him, but it was mostly the script's problem not being able to make that happen. Going from being the fan to being the arch-enemy was way too fast that it could make one say 'WTF?'The thing was that it felt like the Osborns were the main deal. Harry's two-character personality and DeHaan's acting were quite good, though the relationship between the two 'best' friends, who have not seen each other in ten, sorry, eight years was too rushed as well. Osborn's plans did not make much sense either; he could have found another way with all the power he had, instead of negotiating with someone who could kill him with just a finger move.His final arrival at the power station was nonsense, too. Spider-Man has done nothing to make both Electro's and Goblin's hatred to grow so fast, and the timing was way too bad. You could just see what the producers thought: 'We have to kill this Stacy girl, so let's put this Goblin character here. And let's also make him come just after the electric guy dies, so it won't be too much for the Spidey.'The fight between the two was too short for all the development the Green Goblin had throughout the movie, and it was just to make Gwen's death as similar as possible to the real one. Her death, however, was possibly the best moment of the movie, giving me the worst of all goosebumps.Stone and Garfield's chemistry is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie, so their scenes are really breathtaking and makes one go 'Aww' or 'No, he could not have said something that cute!'Moving forward. Richard Parker's story was unnecessary also. The spider venom working only on Parkers was not that important of an information, and the YouTube video was too private to be a YouTube video. Starting with 'They may say bad things about me' and giving all the answers Peter was looking for, and then saying that he was the most important thing? Seriously?The movie, in general, was way too rushed and even worse than Spider-Man 3, considering the overload of characters. The plot was so weak that it was really easy to see what's coming. A Marvel movie is a Marvel movie, so go watch it, but don't await something 'amazing'.",7,8,17,26 April 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," I am... Great?
","Opposed to others who have worshipped it or hated it down to their single cells, I really have no idea about how I feel about this movie. Probably because of my immensely limited knowledge about the Guardians themselves - which I presume is the case with most - I did not really have any hard feelings about anything that was left out or presented poorly, if I had known them correctly myself for that matter. No Gambits, no Deadpools, no Angels; yet no Quicksilvers also.'Star-Lord, man? Legendary outlaw?'First of all, it was too hardcore of a fantasy movie for me, which was also a problem for me at my first time with Thor: The Dark World. The spaceships and all the aliens with dozens of various colours did not strike me as truly professional work. Second of all, the final battle was not that appealing. Although it had many similarities with that of Captain America: The Winter Soldier's, it was too repetitive opposed to Rogers' being breathtakingly intense. Last but not least, despite it being hilarious, there was more potential in it. Come on, man, we're talking about a cliché-supposed-to-be-hot-yet-not guy, a supposed-to-be-deadly-but-not assassin, a WWE champion that does not get metaphors, a raccoon with anger issues, and a Whomping Willow. What could be funnier?'You're an imbecile.'On the other hand, it was still a quite fun movie to start with. Rocket and Groot were great as expected, and Drax was dreadfully better than what I thought he would turn out to be. It was fast-paced and also slow time to time. The relationships between the characters were well handled, and the CGI was also satisfactory.'No, that was a joke. These two are the only things that I need.'To sum it all up, there's pretty much loads going in my head. So I'll just say 'I am Groot' and you get what I mean.'Why you let him lick you like that for? Gross.'",9,1,7,4 August 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," AGE OF VIBRANIUM and there's also this Ultron guy who happens to have access to it and is not a threat at all who actually gives us a new powerful hero, THANKS!
","Please, you are being too harsh on this movie. It does not have to affect you the way Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Guardians of the Galaxy did, but this certainly is up there in the list of first five; don't you compare this to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or X-Men Origins: Wolverine!NO. There are not so many things going on in this movie. So many things happening is when there are three main villains (*coughs* Spider-Man 3 *coughs*) and you get none of them right because of time issues. So many thing happening is when there is development going on with every single character and you just cannot follow. Not being able to look at everything in fight scenes just gives you the chance to rewind and focus on another character this time around.YES. Ultron is not menacing in any way possible. When I read about it, I thought it was about his voice being much more humane than in the trailers, but he is capable of nothing at all. Thank you for pointing it out, Hawkeye, but Captain America actually was a match for Ultron. Not even counting Iron Man who destroyed his current form and Thor-Vision-Iron Man trio damaging the 'Vibranium' body pretty bad.NO. Hawkeye is not too weak. Why is no one concerned with Widow? BECAUSE BOOBS. I have never quite liked Jeremy Renner for the role, but Hawkeye is the one who seems to be the most hilarious and arrogant, but in fact the one who rescues every other hero in the team who had got beaten because of stupid reasons just because they think they are too powerful for anything coming their way. Hawkeye is skillful and mastering something is way cooler than being born as a demigod, accepting to be experimented on, or having money. But no, portraying him as a family guy was not what he needed. Expecting that it was ridiculous to have just his bow and arrow during such a disaster? It is not empathy but awesomeness we crave about him.YES. Hulk and 'Nat' is not the best pairing to ever happen on earth. She could go with anyone but let's go with the guy who is just too old and unattractive for her. Reasons? Because we need someone to calm him, even though he was capable of controlling himself in the previous instalment. And it's Black Widow, for god's sake! Stop calling him Agent Romanoff. Or 'Nat'???NO. The twins were not underdeveloped. Yes, they came in quick and one went out quick (this is a fabulous pun, accept it), but they were a good addition to the franchise. Their powers really are different from any other, they are mutants after all. Oops, prohibited word right there!YES. The jokes are sometimes too much, but it still is the reason why Marvel shines amongst some other sweet 'super' rivals. Ulysees Klaw pushing it a little too much was perhaps unnecessary, but come on, luckily, he is mighty! Language!This is a movie to stun you with the CGI. It is not supposed to be full of character development; this is when you see every character already developed together, and cannot stand the greatness anymore. It may have similarities with the first one, but to coin a phrase, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'.",7,1,6,2 May 2015
