Casablanca," The Movie Is As Cardboard As The Plane
","I have tried to sit through Casablanca several times through many ages of my life.  I still can not get through it.  I just quit watching it and turn it off.  I do not understand the film. I do not feel any emotion.  It is a boring picture.  Since it is considered a great film,  this time I made myself sit through the whole thing.  Perhaps the computer-colorized version would help.  I liked the ending though.  Nice piano music and songs.",4,8,19,27 September 2001
The Grapes of Wrath," A Great Film But With Too Many Disappointments
","I can see the greatness in this film.  However there are nothing but disappointments in this film.  I kept hoping for a happy ending.  I guess this film was real-life for many families and the film showing this family taking Route 66 makes it historical.  Two things I wish they could have done (possible spoiler) was have the family stay at the Department Of Agriculture Camp and never leave to Fresno and Tom should have never left either.  I wish a good, happy sequel was made for this one.",6,2,8,14 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," To Be the Greatest Epic Trilogy Ever Made!
","Forget Star Wars.  This new version of Lord Of The Rings is 100% the best version ever to be made.  There is so much action and wonderful brand new special effects in this film I hardly had a chance to take a breath.  Just when you think the film is about to end, more of the story continues and continues and continues again.  This is wonderful.  The story is unpredictable and the great suspense and anticipation is enjoyable.  The casting of Elijah Wood  as 'Frodo Baggins' is perfect.  Mr. Wood puts so much emotion into his acting.  His role is believeable.  The casting of Ian McKellen as 'Gandalf'.  is perfect as well.  I would like to see an Academy Award nomination here. For anyone who has seen the animated version of Lord Of The Rings (1978) will throughly enjoy this film.   If you have not, you may not want to see it because it might spoil the next two Lord of the Ring films for you.  That is if you do not want to know the ending.  What is so excellent about this Peter Jackson directed film 'The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) is that you will not have to wait 2, 3, or 5 years for a sequel.  The next continuing story Lord Of The Ring: The Two Towers will be released in movie theatres next year in December 2002 and the conclusive third film Lord Of The Rings:The Return Of The King will be released in December 2003.  I hope this film will top the record 11 Academy Award nominations.  This film is a wonderful roller-coaster ride and you will be emotionally involved with the great acting of the fine cast.",10,0,0,28 December 2001
American Psycho," Worst modern movie ever made!
","This film has no suspense and not the style nor amount of unexpected gore fans of the horror genre are used to being entertained by. The lead is boring,the plot is boring and the film is overlong and boring. The only two character and performances that are interesting and well-acted are played by Jared Leto and the woman in the empty apartment that tells the lead, 'Don't come back'! (Sorry,dear actress, I do not know your name). This Yuppie murderer speaks almost like a Twilight Zone narrator,talks about popular music as if its fine wine or an art exhibit, and gets jealous and angry when a fellow Yuppie shows a whiter,more expensive business card than his. If this film was meant to become a cult, I don't think it can even make that. The simulated sex (albeit, clothed) is fake and looks fake. Full frontal nudity could have helped this film, however the lead is penis shy. This film can easily be cut to 86 min. or 66 min. You might hope the videotape breaks on this one.",Null,0,0,15 September 2001
American History X," Edward Norton's tour de force
","I had never seen Edward Norton befor I saw 'American History X'.  After the end of this film I realized this man has impeccable acting talent and is the next man to win an Academy Award in the near future.  He was nominated for his role in 'American History X'.  You might say this is Edward Norton's tour de force and I was so mesmerized by his performance, almost hypnotic. Don't be frightened away by Edward Norton.  This character is nothing like the actor, down-to-earth Edward Norton.  See him in other films, 'Primal Fear' and 'Keeping The Faith'.  You will become a fan of his too.                          This film is about a Skinhead who gets revenge of the bad black men for vandalizing his car.  His little brother idolizes him.  I will not say anymore about the plot, but every person who is fed up with the neighborhood they live in and every parent who would like their teenager to be on the right path should watch this film.  Please discuss this film with your child.                                                            Skinheads, Nazi's and violent black people just is not my thing to watch in a movie, but 'American History X' is the exception.  It is very realistic and there is a message here for all.                                             This film contains sexual situations, full frontal nudity, violence, male rape and cursing.",8,0,0,17 September 2001
Ocean's Eleven," No Scenes Of Them Counting The Money. Flat Ending.
","Good performances by George Clooney and Carl Reiner.  SPOILER: The ending was flat.  There were no scenes of ya-hoo nor hurrah after they pulled off the heist.  No scenes of them counting the money.  And we do not get to see all the money they stolen afterwards. There was no emotional nor dramatic pay-off for the audience.                                               What really unnerved me was that old let's-move-the-camera-fast around the room trick.  The cameo appearance of Angie Dickinson was all to quick and then the camera rushed over to Wayne Newton.  I would have loved to have seen Angie Dickinson a little bit more than just a blink of an eye.  They should have given Ms. Dickinson a good, juicy role to play in this film.  I missed other cameos too. They must have been all too quick.  I am all for happy endings, but the very last scene ('three to six months later') was dull.  Only a sequel could make up for it.  Could they make a sequel?  Would we love to see this cast together again make another casino heist?   You betcha!  But considering all the trouble and red tape it took to get this film made and the voluntary pay cuts the actors allowed to help get this film made, I think a sequel is highly unlikely.  I hope a DVD version or a special video version will ADD more unseen scenes INTO the film.",7,0,1,12 December 2001
Men in Black II," Will Smith and Special Effects do not always make a film work.
","A long-awaited sequel.  Never had I heard so much bad word-of-mouth about a film even before it was released.  I was very disappointed in Men In Black II.  I somewhat enjoyed the first film. Will Smith seems to play the same smart-aleck character in every film he does.  In this one, he is cutting people off in mid-sentence wanting them to shut-up.  Being rude and insulting to white people in this film really turned me off.  Bad writing. I didn't feel there was enough screen time for Tommy Lee Jones.  Is there a plot in this film?  Interesting was the cameo appearance of singer/actor/entertainer Michael Jackson.  Perhaps Michael Jackson would have been better than Will Smith  (Michael Jackson was good in THE WIZ [1978]). The outtakes were of just more of Will Smith wasting more valuable time just to be silly and get attention.  The Blooper reel shows how unprofessional Will Smith can be whereas Tommy Lee Jones can prove how much of a consummate actor he is.  Tommy Lee Jones can be serious and jump right back into character when the director needs it.  The sequel just might have killed the entire Men In Black franchise once and for all.  Will Smith and Special Effects does not always work for a film.  Men In Black means 'black suit' not 'ethnic'.  I would like to see Tommy Lee Jones do a Men In Black without Will Smith.  I liked the alternate ending where Will Smith was put in the egg pod.  Perhaps that is where they should have cut and ended the film right there.  Watch Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS (1978).",5,0,0,29 March 2003
The Matrix," Excellent film for adult men to see. A man's film.
","An excellent, dream-like, suspenseful,action-filled, heart-beating film.  An excellent film, with ground-breaking historical special effects, for all adult men to see.  A Man's film.   What I disliked about the film and by film makers in general is the use of slight green tint. It is unneccessarily used.  I would have given The Matrix the highest rating if the film was entirely in rich, true colors.",7,0,0,16 March 2002
