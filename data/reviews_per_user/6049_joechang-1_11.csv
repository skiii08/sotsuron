The Avengers," It is great! Go see it.
","I just want to tell you it is a great movie, go see it ASAP.We all have seen a lot of fake 3D movie in the past two years, I am very fed up with it, I can't believe they charged the same money as the Avatar! I think some movie makers should pay us back the money we spent, but for the Avengers it is money well spent! The 3D effect is marvelous.Avengers is the squeal to Thor (I am very sure) , unlike Battleship uses John Woo's style slowly cooking the oven (too slow sometimes), Avenger is like a hot knife cutting the butter ----> straight to the point, I just love it.To watch this movie is like riding the world's best roller-coaster, I guarantee you that you will love it as well!",Null,10,21,25 April 2012
Skyfall," A total disappointment!
","I watched it yesterday and I gave it a B minus, for a 50 year anniversary film it should have done better. OK, the movie started in Turkey, the roof top scene has been in recent movies at least 2 or 3 times, not sure why they picked that place? Bond has been abandoned again by the stupid old witch and declared dead, why he chose to go back to report for duty? The story isn't convincing enough. And the villain Silva played by Javier Bardem, Mr. Bardem tried very hard, but he still doesn't sound like an Englishman to me, how did he end up to be a British agent? another setback! And the final battle took place in Bond's childhood mansion? WTF! The film company should shoot the screen play writer first. Oh, I forgot to mention, this movie has the worst Bond girls ever!The director of this movie is not a bad director, but through his career he hasn't done any good action movies as yet, so again bad choice for the movie company.Bond's gadgets are limited to a handgun, a radio and the old DB-5 driven in Goldfinger, my God the new Q looked so stupid!In most Bond movies there're always and Master evil mind behind every evil, this movie is like the evil stops right here, why?Anyway, I think this is a stupid movie, rent a DVD and save your money!",Null,8,19,3 November 2012
Fast & Furious 6," I love this movie!
","I went to see this movie last night and it exceeded my expectations, most of the actions took place in London, so we all get a great guided tour for the beautiful city.A lot of people including myself are wondered about the third movie of the episodes the Tokyo Drift, it looked a bit isolate, this time the director connected the whole story dots with the Tokyo Drift and Jason Statham will play a role in the next episode as a villain, cool!We all know Mr. Vin Diesel is a muscular guy, but 'The Rock' is getting stronger and bigger each day, he made Vin look like a normal guy and Tyrese Gibson calls him Hulk, funny! Vin you'd better work on your muscles quickly, I am worried The Rock might take your place as Riddick in the near future.To sum all things up, this movie is a fun ride, great action scenes, decent acting, and I am proud the director Justin Lin is a Taiwanese!",Null,0,0,26 May 2013
Pacific Rim," A mixture of Mazinger and Godzilla?
","A lot of people might compare this movie with Transformers, not me, I think this movie is a mixture of Mazinger and Godzilla. This movie is very Japaneseish.Does it have a good story? Not really, it's a bit mindless. Does it have good visual effects? Definitely! I think it is the best 3D movie this year.Most alien movies will tell you where the aliens are from, but this movie just gives you a lot of monsters without explanations, kinda sucks. How about acting? Charlie Hunnam is good, another young bright star, he reminds me of the late Heath Ledger.If you have an HDTV at home, you can wait for the blue ray DVD and save some money!",6,2,8,14 July 2013
Rush," The best movie this year so far!
","Mr. Ron Howard is a great story teller, this movie is about human nature, love and tears.It is difficult to make a good movie about car racing, especially to make one for the time period from 1970 to 1976. I don't know how they did it to bring those old F1 cars back to life. You will feel like you are really there watching the racing, it's really unbelievable.It is truly touching to see each character played their perfect role for this movie, Chris Hemsworth did a great performance, he is such a talented and devoted actor. Daniel Br√ºhl also did a great job on portraying the eccentric and unsociable legendary F1 driver Niki Lauda.A great movie is like having a great meal, a good starter, a good soup/salad, a good main course and a good dessert, well balanced. Rush is that good meal, it's a fun ride!I have to say I really enjoyed watching this movie. Thank you Mr. Ron Howard for making this masterpiece.",10,215,255,13 September 2013
Avengers: Endgame," The grand finale of all hero stories!
","The directors did a fantastic job on weaving all the characters all together! A masterpiece! It reminds me of the Return of The King of the Lord of the rings trilogy!But it still got some glitches though! Such as a person killed herself from the past. Does that make sense? And to acquire a hammer from 2013 and that hammer was destroyed in 2017 already, I am gonna freak out man! Did the production crew consult with Kip Thorne about the possibility? And why Captain wasn't worthy in 2015 and all the sudden being worthy in 2019?It's a great movie don't get me wrong! I personally give it a 10!",10,0,1,4 May 2019
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Oh no, the Ring is back!
","I remember Peter Jackson said in one of the Lord of The Rings DVDs that he won't direct another movie related to Lord of The Rings, looks like he ate his words!I went to see The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey today. To be honest I was a bit disappointed about the 3-D effect, I can't understand why no director can create a 3-D movie as good as Avatar? Mr. Cameron has set the standards too high I guess.So how about the story? I gave it a 6 out of 10 (10 is for the Return of The King), Mr. Jackson somehow altered the story on how Gollum lost the Ring to Bilbo and Mr. Jackson tried to cover too many details in 160 minutes, it's a bit difficult for a fan like me to digest, not to mention others new audiences who are new to the franchise. The brown wizard on the rabbit sledge is very stupid. Too much animation is the major drawback.Do I like the Lord of The Ring story? Of course I love it! But this movie is just very crude compares to the previous trilogy. I hope the next The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug will be better.",6,2,15,14 December 2012
1917," A stupid movie!
","Among all the wars World War I was the worst! Human lives were worthless! Two lance corporals carried a stupid order to the God forsaken front line to stop soldiers from dying? Hell no, these men were doomed no matter what!There is no honor by carrying the message because nobody cares! I can't see any friendship either! So what is left for us to see?",1,26,62,17 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Stupid movie!
","J.J. Abrams is a much better director!A good director needs to be a good story teller, Rian Johnson isn't a good story teller, he literally destroyed this movie!The Force Awakens was a masterpiece! I still watch it from time to time, but The Last Jedi I wouldn't watch it again, it's painful and agonizing!",1,11,32,30 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not as good as The Force Awakens!
","I think 8.3 is too high, 7 is more adequate! It is too long, it will be better if it's 120 minutes! I think Star Wars is on its way to a dead end, because there's no more story to tell! The Last Jedi is just repeating all the old stories! Snoke has to be the wimpiest dark lord! Mark Hamill is just an old turd. Leia's face looks fake, perhaps its done by CGI?I went to see it with high hope now I want my money back! It is just not good enough!",1,11,42,13 December 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," A great copycat
","This is a good movie no doubt, but it's not a copycat? Really it's first of its kind? I can name quite a few predecessors if you guys are interested to know.1. Groundhog Day (1993), trapped in a time loop to wake up everyday the same day. Ring a bell?2. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010), the dagger can turn back time and the grand reset at the end to the starting point. Can you see the resemblance?3. Source Code (2011), could it be a same writer for the both movies? I am not sure, but it is the same story, eh?The Aliens looked almost identical as Sentinals in the Matrix. Please don't get me wrong, this is a great movie, highly recommended, go see it!",9,0,2,10 July 2014
