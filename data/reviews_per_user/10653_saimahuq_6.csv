Catch Me If You Can," has all the makings of a cult hit!!
","This movie is based on the true story of Frank William Abagnale, who, at the age of 16, had a short but brilliant career as a major con artist, faking a career as an airline pilot, pediatrician and lawyer, all the while being pursued by the FBI.What got me most about the movie was how simple it is to say anything and have people believe you. Frank is very clever and quick-witted, telling lies very smoothly, even when caught off-guard. He is perceptive and knows how to get information off people in a disarming conversation, then use it to further his schemes. The funniest scenes are when he watches TV shows about doctors or lawyers and uses the dialogue in his 'real life' -- when he addresses a non-existent jury at a preliminary hearing after watching 'Perry Mason', the judge yells, 'Son, WHAT is wrong with you????'The film also is well-directed and beautifully filmed, ranging from tony New York City shots to sunny Miami scenes, where all the women are very very blonde, it seems. The dialogue between DiCaprio and Hanks is very rapid-fire, and it's great to see two such talented box-office stars, known for playing diverse roles, acting together(as opposed to Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt in 'The Mexican' -- they always play the same exact character!)
This is just plain good stuff, a diamond in the rough that is today's movie listings. You will get a kick out of this film, and decide it's well worth your time and money to see it more than once.",Null,0,1,2 January 2003
Minority Report," great flick --- unfortunately has Tom Cruise
","This is a great story -- what if in the year 2054, the goverment has an experiment that uses 'precognitive' people whose sole purpose is to stay unconscious and foretell crimes, then have a special 'pre-crime' police force arrest the perpetrators BEFORE the crime is committed? This eradicates homicide in the District of Columbia (which, in the early 1990s, was known as the Murder Capitol of the World.) However --- where do human rights begin and where do they end? The criminals have not technically committed the crime for which they are arrested, and there is no subsequent trial. And what about the rights of the 'pre-cogs', as they are called, to live a real life? It's interesting, except the aging Tom Cruise is there playing yet another variation of his role in Top Gun. It is so cloying now to see Mr. Unibrow-and-Queasy-Smile dress all in black and pretend to be some type of policeman whose job involves a lot of running. ugh. Should have had Russell Crowe or Ed Norton, just to mix it a bit!",Null,0,0,2 January 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Loved the movie -- v.v. good!
","I saw a sneak preview of this and I loved it! I will admit I did not like the book, but the previews looked so good --- and I was not disappointed! The writers did a great job formulating a compelling plot from the book, you will not take your eyes off the screen the whole time you are in the theater!The best part of the flick is Renee Zellweger herself --- she is excellent as the title character, expressing that bumbling side that does embarrassing things in public that every one of us has and is afraid will show itself --- right in front of the guy we really want. You have to feel for her when the embarrassing situation is not her fault --- someone gives her wrong information and she ends up looking silly, but she takes it all in stride.
And what girl hasn't vowed to take up a campaign of self-improvement because we hope our dream guy will sit up and take notice of our new and improved self?The best thing is watching Bridget discover, over the course of a year, that her true self might be just fine after all.",Null,0,0,11 April 2001
10 Things I Hate About You," obstacles to true love knows no time era
","One thing about the Bard -- he knew the plots that touches everyone's lives, no matter where on the social strata or when in history they may be. It is made apparent in the case of Cameron James, new kid in school, as he falls for the lovely Bianca, who cannot date until her older shrewish sister Kat will date. But Kat doesn't WANT to date, and thus Cameron must scheme to find a suitable guy for this harpy-with-the-heart-of-gold if he is to win the fair Bianca.Julia Stiles may be no Elizabeth Taylor, but then, she doesn't have to be. This flick relays the same message to a brand-new audience and is fun and entertaining to boot (plus I don't think Taylor could dance on a table quite like Stiles does in one of the more memorable scenes.)
In the end, this is a charming movie that will entertain and educate high-schoolers as well as those several years past graduating. After all, Shakespeare knew what he was writing about -- there is no age limit when it comes to matters of the heart!",Null,7,7,25 November 2002
The Nightmare Before Christmas," perfect for Halloween AND Christmas
","Jack, the scary king of Halloween, has grown weary of scaring kids and decides he should try a new tack with a different holiday -- namely, Christmas. To this end, he enlists the help of a few goblins to kidnap Santa Claus so that he, Jack, can take over. The result is a hysterical mess as the Christmas gifts he makes are inevitably scary. The music, written by Danny Elfman, is great with clever lyrics and ghoulish overtones 'Kidnap Mister Santy Claus, put him in a box! Lock him up for 50 years, then see if he talks!'Even though it is animation, it is not really for very young kids, who may be disturbed at the kidnap and torture of Santa Claus. But it is good fun for everyone else in the family!",Null,0,1,25 November 2002
