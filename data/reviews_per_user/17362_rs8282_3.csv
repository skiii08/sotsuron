Blade Runner 2049," nice idea, poor execution. too artistic for it's own good.
","not d-box worthy, barely felt the seat move and when it did it was waking me up as i was losing consciousness. i felt as though the director tried too hard to make it artistic and intense, the result felt simplistic and boring. lot's of dark scenes with highlighted shapes, rough weather and an intense soundtrack, this created an intense feeling, but the simplistic action and dialogue just didn't fit. the action and dialogue felt drawn out and much too tame for the intensity of the set; cool idea but poor execution.",6,3,8,25 October 2017
Justice League," 3d d-box worthy... wanted more background on the enemy.
","watched it in 3d and dbox, definitely worth it, at times it seemed like the seats moved, just to move at times instead of with the actual scene, but it enhanced the show. the 3d was great. there was a surprise in the show that's not in any of the trailers, which made the movie better than expected. i was not a fan of the villains- their purpose, and their story. perhaps if i knew more about the DC world i'd have more respect and understanding for them, but they don't really compare to other villains of other super hero shows. overall an entertaining show with good action and a little humour. definitely worth the watch.",7,1,3,19 November 2017
Dunkirk," a thrill for all your senses.
","this movie is a ride from beginning to end. i sat in the motion D-box seats (i always do if this is an option) unlike some recent movies this really added to the intensity of the movie. from the bullets and bombs exploding, to the high g maneuvers and the sway of the ocean, it truly feels like you are there in the middle of the action. the score made every scene feel like something epic was about to happen and it did. this movie doesn't tease you or play with your thoughts, it puts you in the soldier's shoes and you feel the constant fear that they will either die, be left behind or have lost all hope. the way the story was filmed seemed odd at first, if you don't pay attention there are a few scenes that are repeated but told at different times in the movie. so you'll see it from one point of view and in that point the scene goes from day to night and then that same scene will cut back to day and shot from a different perspective after a few other scenes have played out. watch it in d-box if you have the option and this is a movie meant to be viewed on the big screen.",9,5,13,1 August 2017
