Requiem for a Dream," Horrible
","I mean horrible in a good way. This is an amazing movie, I love it and I think its one of the best movies I have ever seen, but it's still a horrible thought, this movie was sorta hard to watch, but I mean that in a good way to.  I think some things shouldn't be coated so completely with social acceptability that they can no longer disgust the viewer, this movie wasn't and I was impressed. Now, I have to admit to this day I still sorta shiver when I think about this movie.  Harry's mother is a preticularly difficult image for me to cope with.  I saw this movie when I was twelve for the first time, perhaps a little bit young, so I thought maybe this is why I was so shocked. Well now that i have watched it at an older age I see that it was not me. This movie was made to shock. I recommend this movie to a friend of mine and he said he couldn't get through it.  He's a happy guy, likes cartoons and comedy, but he's also into movies like Pi, being John Malkavich (sry for spelling) and Donnie Darko, so I thought he might like it.  Well he described his experience with the film and disgusted, sometimes people just can't handle the reality of it, I am not sure if this is a bad or good thing. In all, this is a great movie, that I can't say I enjoyed but was impressed with and bettered as a person because of it.  I recommend it to you, just try and get through it, you'll be happy that you did, it's a really good film.",Null,0,1,4 November 2003
