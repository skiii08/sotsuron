The Blair Witch Project," Good acting
","If you haven't seen this film yet, you must go and watch before you read any comments or anything else.... This movie is a good example of how much the media can control what people believe.... Many people believed that all of what happened in the movie was true and for some it was hard to believe that it was all just a movie. The television itself was saying that it was a real story and everybody believed in what the television said. This movie will get nominated for many oscars specially for acting and most original. I've never seen a movie that actually would use only two cameras a dat recorder and make so much money in its first weeks.The movie was very original and I really believed that it was all true. The only problem was that I also got sick from the camera that kept on moving a lot. Heather will surelly get a oscar for her acting. The scene where she apologizes really makes the audience believe that she was really all freaked out and scared. I give it a 8 out of 10.",Null,1,2,14 August 1999
