Blade Runner 2049," Boring
",Very overrated film. Far to long. Very boring. Not worthy going to cinema to see. It looks a bit cool and the soundtrack is good but the plot is thin and only gets thinner. Could be OK to look at home if you liked the first one and have absolutely nothing to do with your time. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford look strangely out of place being a good actors both of them.,1,29,65,9 October 2017
