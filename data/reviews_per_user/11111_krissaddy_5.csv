The Avengers," If you miss this on the big screen, you will regret it!!! Simply Epic!!
","Firstly, I have seen this movie twice already and this is THE BEST Marvel movie, anybody else that says otherwise is either out of his mind, lying or hasn't seen the movie yet.You may think that in a movie that consists of four characters who have their own franchise would do injustice to the two new characters in the movie, think again.... Black Widow and Hawkeye also have their time on the screen. But of course the best lines go to Iron Man and the most epic fight scenes go to the Hulk.After watching the two Hulk movies I was a little disappointed only to the extent that they show him as this destructive and out of control monster which he is. But this movie makes you sympathize with him and even make you like him. In fact I felt that the fight scenes involving The Hulk were the best in the whole movie, followed by Iron man! I won hide the fact that I am a huge Batman fan, I find Nolan's movies head and shoulder's over other movies, but this movie is up in the same league. Highly polished character screen presence, well directed, amazingly witty, very very funny and above all visually captivating. I felt the run time was a little short actually. I just didn't want it to end. Considering people were clapping and yelling out their approval for some of the movie's topnotch scenes this movie will be a huge blockbuster which it thoroughly deserves to be. I am predicting it will be the next 1 billion grosser!!! This movie just raised the bar to a whole new level for Marvel movies. Seriously I was more eager for the release of The Dark Knight Rises but wow! What a show by Marvel and I would say full credit to Joss Whedon. You sir are just outstanding... The movie was tight and it didn't have any loose ends worth mentioning. First my favorite series of all time Firefly, now this, thank you, Joss Whedon!!! That was a mind-blowing movie. I will watch it a few more times! ;)",10,5,12,30 April 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," IMAX 3D is how you gotta experience this film. Super cool!!
","Since there are other reviews that have already said what I wanted to say about this film. I will keep this short and simple. I'll tell you why I feel this is one of the greatest sequels ever. Firstly, I love the first reboot, Star Trek {2009}. I have seen it 23 times. I own the Bluray and I am addicted to that film. I had huge expectations for this film and I am glad to say its on par with that film and it even exceeds the first one in many ways. Though the promos and trailers show it as a darker film, which it actually is but still it has its light moments which are pretty witty. This movie has everything going for it. Be it direction, background music, screenplay, special effects, sound effects and sound mixing. The movie shines in all the departments. Great pacing, superb dialogs and incredible acting make this film a must watch. STID goes at warp speed and I may watch it a couple of times more. Its definitely the second best IMAX 3D movie I have ever seen after AVATAR. Simply Outstanding. 10/10 Gem of a movie. JJ Abrams had outdid himself. HE did the unthinkable. He has improvised on perfection.",10,4,20,17 May 2013
Baby Driver," All you need is one killer director and lots of great songs!!!
","There are no standards for a guy like Edgar Wright, he keeps making unique and original movies and sets his own standards. This is his most realistic movie to date and a little darker in tone than his earlier works. Nevertheless, I absolutely enjoyed the technical aspects of the movie especially the whole rhythm of the movie. How many movies have gun shots synced with the BGM or cars' gears shifting to the tempo of a song? This movie has so much rhythm in every aspect, be it the quiet moments or the insane chase sequences, the editing as usual in an Edgar Wright movie is captivating. It was as if Edgar Wright was conducting a choir... It was super stylish. I'm sure it will take another viewing to grasp some of the minor things that I may have missed in this fast paced piece of brilliance. Everybody knows by now that the movie's greatest feature is its killer soundtrack and I absolutely loved the way songs are used in this movie, they don't play passively in the background but are an extension of Baby himself. Everything in this film feels deliberate and carefully planned. I think Baby Driver will go down as one of the most original action/romance movies made in recent years. This is the third movie this year after Logan and John Wick 2 that I thought is a contender for future classic status. Baby Driver is a meticulously crafted masterpiece from a director who just can't make bad movies. Highly Recommended.",10,20,38,30 June 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Thoroughly entertaining, but still the second best....
","I had the opportunity of watching this movie on the second day of its release on this Saturday. Nearly 4 days before the actual US release.Firstly lets leave the whole, 'Oh! its a reboot and not a sequel' thing outside the door. Its something the industrial analysts must be bothered about. As an audience it does not matter to me. I just want a movie to be entertaining and this movie is really better than the first Spiderman movie. This movie is getting unfair treatment as its a reboot. This movie should be judged by its own merit and not by comparisons. I consider myself blessed and entertained.... This may not be one of the jump-the-gun fast paced superhero flicks, it takes it time to establish the characters. Even the character development is done is a beautiful and entertaining way. I though this was much needed as people were already used to Spider man story and the mentality needed to change and realize that 'Its not the same deal anymore'. That was necessary and it was done perfectly. If you have seen 500 Days of Summer, you know that Marc Webb is good at directing romantic scenes, he has used this skill to his advantage and he has done a great job of showing the romance between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker... When it comes to performances, Andrew Garfield gets full points for being the best spider man in town... Not only does he look like spider man from the comics, his character was bratty and more vibrant than the 'Toby Maguire spidy' which I really liked. Andrew is a good actor. I have always liked him since I first saw Boy A, thankfully he didn't fade into the void, Emma Watson playing Gwen Stacy the love interest of Spiderman really hit the bulls-eye. She looks gorgeous and lovable and she fits the role like a glove. The chemistry between the two is one of the high points of the movie... They look amazing together. Its a pity that Uncle Ben had to die in this movie, Martin Sheen fit the bill. The others did their job well. Its a better acted movie than all the first three Spidy movies. The second half of the movie is action packed with some tangible human spirit imbibed into it. There is one particular scene towards the end when Spidy is gravely hurt and the whole city comes to his rescue. It reminded me of brilliant 'train scene' in Spider man 2, which is also my top spidy moment ever. Lizard as the villain was not as menacing as the previous bad guys in the Spider man Series, but a lot of the story is open for continuity and more villains are sure to follow. Also Lizard was not actually supposed to be menacing as he is still a good man gone bad due to a lab experiment gone wrong. Finally I would have to point out that this movie is made in 3D and they took advantage of our Superhero's maneuverability to a great extent. Some of the first person shots are breathtaking and feels like you are there with Spidy all the way. I would say this is my second favorite Spider man Movie after Spider Man 2. Its a slow movie no doubt but establishes the characters properly once it gets going it gets more entertaining. I am more than sure that the sequel will 'Go for it!' from the start. A must watch movie for all Spider man fans. Truly 'Amazing'! Marc Webb Good job!",10,23,33,3 July 2012
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman is DC's destiny's child and Patty Jenkins hit this out out of the park
","'Never send a woman to do a man's job' they said but, I believe that 'If you want to get a job done right, get a woman to do it.' This is true of the film's director Patty Jenkins and the lead actor Gal Gadot, two female bad-asses who showed DC in specific and Hollywood in general how a fresh superhero movie is done.Wonder Woman fumigates some of the conventional superhero movies tropes and refreshingly tries something old-school, it has a simple origin story, and it brings in a female perspective on the genre by upping the emotional aspects and cuts down on the acidulous elements. As someone who is new to the character, I don't know the principles this superhero stood for. Diana was written and portrayed as a woman who is innocent, hopeful, caring, empathetic, uncompromisingly good, optimistic, and fierce on the battlefield and most of all she is what an ideal superhero should be: inspiring. Gal Gadot was perfectly cast for this role. Diana thinks that it's her duty to save humanity despite the cautions by her highly protective mother who shields her from ever coming in contact with humanity up to a certain point. But Diana is a destiny's child and she has to leave the Amazonian land eventually in search of her purpose in life.I was unimpressed by Gal Gadot in BvS, probably because Ben Affleck stole the show in that film. But now that she got her first standalone movie as the Wonder Woman I am thoroughly impressed by her. She is stunning in the Wonder Woman bustier and skirt but beyond that, she has this infectious charm about her; be it her smile, accent, screen presence, she is a treat to watch. She's agile in the fight sequences, she does it so naturally and with emotion, I was thoroughly impressed by that. (On a side note, Robin Wright and Connie Nielson look very fit for their age; believe it or not, they're both pushing 50s now. These women sure have some fine genes.)Chris Pine as Steve plays a foil to her, while she is naive in her approach towards humanity he is more street smart yet as dutiful as Diana and knows what Diana doesn't know, that humanity is flawed and may not be worthy of her compassion. As usual, Chris plays this charming guy who has a way of impressing with his words. He has impeccable comic timing, the pauses, and his facial expressions add to his enamoring presence. The chemistry Chris shares with Gal in this film is scintillating. It's one of the main reasons why this film works. You tend to root for them. I don't remember the last time I've hoped a couple hooked up in a superhero movie before. It felt organic and real. In that way, this is a superhero-romance movie. There are many elements of romance in this film which are not present in many (any?) superhero movie to date.Patty Jenkins knows how to pace her movie. This film never felt rushed or too slow, the pacing was just right. The story was simple and it gave her ample time to build the characters the way she wanted. This lady can shoot amazing action sequences. The first confrontation of the movie between the Germans and the Amazonians was a blast but arguably the standout action sequence was when Diana jumps into the front line and takes on a barrage of bullets head on, in order to defend innocent people because she feels it's her duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves. It was somehow liberating to watch her find purpose in finally doing what she trained all her life for. The action choreography is stellar and there's a grace to it.The reason why this film diverges so much from the other movies in DCU though is not that of the action sequence but because it gets some of the subtle character moments dabbled sporadically, making Diana believable. There's the hilarious conversation between Steve and Diana about human reproduction, Diana trying out her clothes in London, Steve telling Diana that maybe humanity is not exactly what she thought it would be, and my favorite of these sequences comes just before she enters the war zone when Steve treats her to an ice- cream and she relishes it like a child and appreciates the ice-cream vendor saying he should be proud of himself. Even in the middle of the war sequence, she's mindful of her friends and checks to see if they are alright. These are important emotions to make a character believable. Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were so pompous and larger than life that they forgot what superheroes stand for; the people who pit their hopes in them.The final fight is not as impressive as the rest of the film but still, there are a couple of character moments that I think ground the scene. At 2 hours 20 minutes this film may be long but it doesn't 'feel' long due to the appropriate pacing. Maybe you may start feeling a bit of the length bearing down on you during the climactic fight.The dialogues and the background music need to be mentioned specifically for elevating some of the sequences in this film. We do get to hear the iconic theme music but only after almost 70 minutes into the film and as it's her first decisive fight against people who are actually trying to kill her. I think this is the second superhero film this year after Logan where the conversations flow naturally. This film had THE best dialogues in the DCU so far.",9,11,23,6 June 2017
