Ali," WILL SMITH COMES OF AGE!
","With the making of this movie, I feel that we can finally say that Mr. Smith has truly 'come of age' as an actor !  He played the part of a person so steeped in our psyche, with an admirable sense of the man that Ali was then. Up till now, I always felt that Mr. Smith was a rather light-weight actor....I happily retract that slur on his rep!!!",8,0,0,7 May 2002
The Big Lebowski," An All/Time FAV!!!
",They don't come any better/funnier than this! Perhaps my fav. film of all time!!! These guys are masters at making entertaining intelligent funny movies. I just wish they could make a Big L II..even though I usually loathe sequels!!,10,0,1,26 May 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Bland,Banal & Boring!!!
","First of all, let me say that the one good thing about this movie was that I got it out on DVD, and therefore only paid about $2 to watch this excerible rubbish!! Terrible script,ridiculous plot, so-so acting and a film that ran far too long!!  Andy Garcia should know better, but one supposes the $$$ was too good to refuse!! Whoever put those pile of clichÃªs into the script needs flogging at the very least!!! I gave this a 4 rating... and that was generous!",4,0,1,26 October 2002
Pearl Harbor," Special Effects 5, Acting Etc. 0
","I gave this movie a 5, solely on the basis of some pretty impressive special effects. Apart from that most everything else was awful, the dialogue, acting, casting all AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!! The typical gung-ho b*llsh*t that this film exuded nearly made me vomit, when I wasn't laughing at the pathetic scenes. Mr.Afleck trying to look soooo macho was hilarious!! Virtually nobody gets out of this movie with their (acting) reputation intact, hope the money was good!!!!",5,0,1,19 October 2002
A Beautiful Mind," A stunning performance from Mr.Crowe
","Whilst admitting that the film has flaws (which film doesn't??), I was VERY impressed by Mr. Crowe´s performance. However I would have liked more put into the 'wilderness' years, which included travel in Europe and USA. Perhaps it is a little too much to ask, but we could have used more background on his treatment and 'recovery'.",8,0,1,7 April 2002
Signs," Show me a NEW plot line...PLEASE!!!!
","Whilst all the actors performed their roles well, the plot line was disappointing.  Haven't we seen this kind of (weak) plot before?  The premise that these super-intelligent creatures can be defeated by wooden doors beggars belief!!As to the 'reason' for their ultimate defeat, it smacks of either 8th grade wannabe writers or sheer laziness!  What a con of a movie. I feel like drawing up my own plot, it couldn't be lamer than this! Are U.S. audiences really prepared to accept this kind of dross in 2002??",5,2,3,30 September 2002
