Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A bit of disappointment
","I heard somewhere that Kill Bill Vol.2 is way better than Vol.1 but it obviously ain't. It's quite boring and thank God i didn't go to cinema to watch it. I watched it on DVD. There's too much talking/explaining and it really gets boring. The first one was a little boring too, but the action was way better. In this movie there's only two 'good' scenes to watch (remember) and that's when Uma first goes to Madsen and he shoots her and second when Uma meets Darly Hannah. After that fight scene the movie just get boring for another hour.I expected a 'big' fight scene between Uma and David Carradine (Bill) but everything was over in few seconds which was quite disappointing.And the thing that bothered me the most was that Uma hardly even says anything in this movie and the thing that everyone says how good and sexy she looks, when her look in 'Kill Bill' is definitely her worst look ever.Uma used to be really hot (remember 'Batman & Robin' or 'The Avengeres'), but she looks exhausted and very old for her real age in this two movies.All in all, i expected much more from both of 'Kill Bill' but i think it's obvious that Tarantino's best movie was 'Pulp Fiction' and that's the far-est he can go.I give this movie 4/10 and the first part 5/10.",4,4,9,25 December 2004
Van Helsing," Fantastic entertaining movie!
","This is definitely one of the best movies of 2004. After being disappointed with the likes of 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'I, Robot' this was definitely a highlight of 2004.Hugh Jackman did a great interpretation of Van Helsing and so did Kate Beckinsale as Anna. A great entertaining movie with lots of special and visual effects, combined with a great story. This movie is far better than any of 'Lord of the Rings' movies - 'Van Helsing' shows us a real adventure and it's not boring for even one second, while we get tired and (or) fall asleep while watching 'Lord of the Rings'.This is a fantastic movie and it definitely deserved all those millions it earned around the globe.A masterpiece of 2004. The year 2004 was probably the worst year in movies, but this film definitely showed that there are still great films out there. Big congratulations to director Stephen Sommers for such a brilliant film.The only other film that can manage to conquer 'Van Helsing' as 2004s best picture is definitely 'Spider-Man 2' but even that movie gets kinda boring in some parts and it's a little too long, while 'Van Helsing' lasts pretty long as well, but it's not boring for even one second.The special and visual effects were amazing during the whole movie, and i just adore movies that are so entertaining and full of action, and has a great story and great actors on the other side. Fabulous.10/10",10,6,10,13 January 2005
