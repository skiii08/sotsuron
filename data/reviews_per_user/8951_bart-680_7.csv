World War Z," Best Zombie movie out there..
","I cannot review the book because i have not seen it, but if is anything like the movie im sure its a great book.
This isnt just your average zombie movie were as you start off from the middle of it all and it is just set in one place.
This is about David played by Brad Pitt (damn good choice by the way) who is a family man who is trying to protect his family while a virus sweeps the world. There is so much action going on it gets hard to turn away.
Yes its got zombies, yes there are parts that are somewhat believable but, its a movie and i really recommend it.
its a Netflix and chill movie just relax well try to aha",8,4,5,24 February 2020
Ready Player One," the cgi will blow your mind
","My brother kept persuading me to watch this eventually I saw the trailer and I thought it looked pretty decent so I decided to get the uhd 4k version boy I did not regret it, when I saw Stephen speilberg was directing it I was not let down he says this is the 3rd hardest movie he has had to direct, I can see why.
