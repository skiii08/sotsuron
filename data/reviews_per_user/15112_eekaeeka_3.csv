Sucker Punch," Impressive at times, too much CGI, but its saving grace is the end
","The IMDb average rating for this film is fair (6.3 at the moment) It does dazzle the eyes at times, impressive CGI, but too much of it, it's not necessary to tell a good story and this is what is hindering cinema at the moment. In 1992 when it was new, T2 was cutting edge, but now CGI is everywhere, I prefer the puppet Yoda not the CGI one, too much CGI for me, got bored with it to tell you the truth.However interlaced within the unnecessary CGI is a bit of dialogue and story, and this is a decent premise, it tells it's story similar to Inception almost, except instead of a dream the 'fantasy world' is a metaphoric world. It started well and ended well, very well in fact, this was when the film was set in 'reality' if only they had interspersed more 'reality' moments this film could have been a lot better, they could have lost one of the CGI segments and peppered in more 'reality' moments that were happening in conjunction with the 'fantasy' moments, this could have made the film 9 or 10, as it had that potential.I do believe though that this film was marketed for a certain demo-graph, and so it probably does them well, but we, the people like films that are universal, and so although a good film all things considered, I will definitely watch again! Let it be known though I am a bit of a Grinch when it comes to CGI (that is CRAP GRAPPLING INCOME) I even found Iron Man 2 boring because of it, they can by all means use it but there has to be a limit, especially if the crap grappling income is used at the expense of character development and what could have been decent dialogue. End of story.",7,1,2,6 July 2011
Horrible Bosses," Horrible Bosses. Horribe Employees?
","This film has good casting first off, you have the three main leads by up and coming comedy actors and then you have three A-List Hollywood heavy weights, and Jennifer Aniston (looking very sexy may I add) supporting the film.Let's start with Kevin Spacey, very convincing - you do actually want him to be punched. The best scenes are the ones with him in. The story kind of revolves his character.Without giving too much away, the situation these three guys find themselves is one in which a lot of people can relate to (at least in their heads), and so 'Horrible Bosses' lends itself to be watched by anyone who works (which is many people). You will have empathy, and you will be hoping the story unfolds in such a fashion as to keep you amused, and it does. Some moments are incredibly hilarious, others are low brow and bordering on acceptable, just. There are also tedious moments and there are also many moments of Hollywood cliché that can offend. However there is much amusement to be had and the steady pace is welcomed, with many laugh out loud moments peppered within the film.Jamie Fox was not necessary though, although his character is essential to the story, Jamies' Hollywood punch has no finesse in this film, this role could have been played anyone. Jamie Fox is mere window dressing for the films credits.Jennifer Aniston is necessary, she provides sexiness and plays her role well, a charming easy going demeanor throughout and she does manage to get under your skin with her brash ways.Colin Farrell's character seems to be a bit of a parody in terms of looks to Tom Cruise in 'Tropic Thunder' and for me, expecting more of Colin I was heavily disappointed with this role, he never quite mastered it, you are left unconvinced.The three lead actors did an okish job, you believe them. At least they manage to have you engrossed for the most part with their clumsiness and unfortunate, but amusing series of events they are subjected too. This film relies heavily on 'murphy's law' if something can go wrong it will, and it does, many times. A few good twists, most predictable though.This film has to be recommended, not highly but it is definitely not one to be missed: Out of 10 for the following facets:Laugh Out Loud Moments: 7 Good Casting: 8 Coughing Your Coffee Through Your Nose Moments: 5 Jennifer Aniston, sexy as: 8. Overall: 6.5 More at tootbit.com",Null,1,2,27 October 2011
Super 8," Expected Big Things That Were Not Delivered
","Super 8 has one of the best trailers you are ever likely to see. I was expecting big things, something different, something original and paranormal, however what the film delivered was cliché and very normal.To start with the film has a very 'Goonies' feel to it, it could almost be a sequel, except after an extremely well done train crash the plot kind of takes a crash too.The sets, clothes, cars etc have a nice dated feeling to them, very reminiscent of the first 'Back to The Future' film, it creates an electric atmosphere to the film, this and the acting of Ellie Dakota are probably the only saving graces this film has.There are a few comedic moments, most provided by 'the local stoner', perhaps what 'Super 8' lacked most in was the comedy, it was too thinly spread and a few more laughs would have kept the film more captivating, as it was, there are many times I found myself bored in the cinema and I was more interested in planning what to eat at MacDonalds, however there is a decent 'mood' to this film and although it was boring in places I did however get a light buzz from this film, so it cannot be all bad.7.2 rating on IMDb at the moment, I was expecting around 6.These are the marks I give it out of ten for the following facets: Nice 80's atmosphere: 9 CGI etc: 7 Comedy: 3 Edge of the seat moments: 4 Ellie Fanning's acting: 8 Overall 6.5 More Reviews at tootbit.com",Null,0,1,26 October 2011
