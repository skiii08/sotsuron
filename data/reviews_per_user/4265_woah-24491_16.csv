Scarface," You need movies like this you cockroaches so you can point your fingers and say 'that's a classic'
","Scarface is a classic and the best most entertaining drug cartel business movie,al pacino's performance is amazing,this movie is filled with that 80s feel, the music the stripclubs, the beaches cars and the Hawaiian T shirts, theres a perfect balance of humor and violence, and the journey from Tony Montana coming from cuba as an immigrant then slowly make his way up to the top pushing it to the limit by transporting drugs for the big guys, then screwing then over and taking over to becoming the top dog,scarface is a classic masterpiece",10,0,1,25 August 2019
