Love and Death," Funny?
","Still, though there have been 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan', this is my favourite Allen movie. But I am not sure (opposing to many posts on this film) that this really is a comedy. From the first moments on, death is present in that film. But in the beginning, there is a great divergence between the horrors depicted and the way Allen shows them to us. The first situation which gets that out of order (and which gets us really to think) is the strange dream scene. But the real wonder of the film is how weirdest kamikaze-humour and deep truth slowly manage to find together. In the end, truth has come into everything (look at the great scene with Sonja and Natasha at the end), and the final scene is unparalleled in its relaxed way of meeting death - Love and Death are meeting in that incredible totally 'chilled' gray-blue tones of the winter landscape and Allen dancing across the final border (and Prokofiev's wonderful music).",10,0,0,10 August 2007
