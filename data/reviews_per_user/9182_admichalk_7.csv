Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Newb and not sure what to expect
","I was and have never been a part of the 'star wars fandom' before or knew the background stories so I saw this with un-bias, fresh eyes.This was the first movie I have seen of the series as I was told it was the first in chronological order.First off, I would like to recommend closed captions. It is very hard to follow the names, species and places based in this non-fictional world without reading it as well.About the film... I thought it was a very creative storyline. The graphics were okay for the time period it was made in (circa. 1999). The fictional hierarchy order of the lore was cool too once I understood it.I did think that dialogue could have been improved as it was pretty dry and stoic. I also came across a few plot holes, inconsistencies, and 'it just works that way' scenarios which is a pet peeve of mine.",5,1,3,28 December 2019
Train to Busan," Want a happy ending? This aint it chief
","Or maybe it is depending on how optimistic you are...
I enjoy films like this-- where the bad guy is winning over and over again. I hate predictable storylines and I am glad to say this film had me on edge.
Also, can I also mention how amazing the tiny actress is? She is going places for sure! I cannot wait to follow the main actors and actress and see what other films they have starred in.
The CGI, although not a major detriment, took away my attention slightly and broke the wall between story and film but AGAIN not a complaint, just a mention.8/10!",8,0,1,29 February 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Tarentino did it again
",I just adore that fact you can tell it's a tarentino film if its whitty but hard hitting at the same time.,8,1,2,12 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Star Wars Episode II ft. Creepy Aniken
","I watched this movie for the first time right after episode I (also watched for the first time).Right off the bat, I think some scenes and dialogue were unnecessary-- especially the one where Ani is complaining about sand...
Graphics in some scenes were horrible.
I think Hayden Christensen did a poor job of portraying Aniken. I did not read the comics so maybe I am off for saying this is wrong, but I did not enjoy seeing his slightly creepy facial expressions during almost every scene, including the lovers scenes. Did not set the mood for me at all.
Am I also weird for saying the fight scenes were way too long? That may just be a preference of mine.
Overall it was an interesting story line but far out from what I expected this hyped up franchise to be.",5,0,0,28 December 2019

Parasite," So many twists and turns I got whiplash
","I thought I knew what was happening but it turns out I didnt even know what I didnt know.
Cinematography was so well done. Comedy relief at the exact moments it needed it. My stress levels at a max the entire last quarter I had to physically cover my gaping mouth with my hand.",9,48,81,11 January 2020
