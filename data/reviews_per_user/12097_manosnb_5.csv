The Devil's Advocate," A pleasant surprise
","I always remembered seeing the TV advertisements of the movie as a kid back in 1997 but I never actually sat to watch it until yesterday. Nice and interesting plot, top- notch actors performing well and a stunning Charlize Theron. However there were two things that were amazing in this movie and made me give it an 8 and not a 7. First the first totally unexpected jump scare scene in the dressing room. Even if you had the slightest idea about Al Pacino's true identity there was no way you were expecting this scare and that made it so unique and thrilling. The second thing was the ending. I do not always like ambiguous endings, especially when they are cheap and with no purpose, but the message of this one was truly thought-provoking. Vanity, oh vanity..",8,0,1,17 February 2016
United 93," So much wasted potential
","I just found this movie after searching for quite some time (like always) for something to watch. I immediately got intrigued by the plot (thriller situation in a plane, heroic true story) and I was sure I found a good catch. Unfortunately, this movie was quite boring, especially the first part. Honestly it could not be worse with such base material and story to work with. I still gave it a 6/10 and it is watchable to an extend but this could have been Oscar-material with better directing and story development. The first half of the movie is completely meaningless and tiring and by the time the second part starts you have no real emotional connection to the passengers of flight 93 or the situation. Surely, for Americans this movie hits some sensitive spots, and hence the big difference in the scores (8.1 for Americans, 7.4 for the rest of the world at the time i write), but whether you are American or not if you want a good thriller or drama there a lot more better ones.",5,0,0,6 August 2016
Milk," With a better soundtrack it could reach a 8..
","Milk was a quite interesting and thought provoking movie overall. In my opinion, its best parts was the lack of cheap discrimination clichés and the solid performance of Sean Pean as Harvey Milk. I have to admit that I liked the persona of Harvey Milk and he would have definitely won my vote back in the 70's San Francisco. Nevertheless, this movie had a major flaw for me; the lack of a heart-touching soundtrack. Beautiful soundtracks can truly elevate a movie, and especially a drama. Unfortunately, this movie left me with no single memory of a melody. Another small that I would change would be a little more character development on secondary roles. But I am not the director anyways.. So all in all, nice topic, solid performances, nice touch avoiding cheap clichés but it did fail to inspire strong emotions. When I choose to watch a drama my ultimate and hidden hope is that I will need one roll of toilet paper to whip my tears off. Happened with Beautiful Mind, with American History X but not with Milk!",7,0,2,17 February 2016
Jurassic World," Uninspiring at best..
","I have many times wondered if the first Jurassic Park seemed so good to me the first time I watched because I was a kid and easily excited or because it was fundamentally good for every audience. I think that partially both reasoning are true. However, I am sure about one thing. Jurassic World would not receive a grade higher than 7 even from my child-self. Very predictable, less thrilling than the originals and the concept of genetically enhanced new species of dinosaurs ruined the original and unique touch of the first movies. If anybody wants to watch a monster movie I am sure there are more than plenty to choose. The only good thing about this film for me was the nostalgia felt in some scenes and the beautiful old soundtrack playing again. But that was pretty standard to expect, wasn't it?",5,2,6,17 February 2016
The Big Short," If you are into finance this is the movie for you..
","I have to admit that I have watched many 'wall street' movies but none felt so real as this one. The fact that the script is based on a Michael's Lewis book obviously contributed significantly to that direction. In addition, the cast in this movie is amazing. I really appreciated the performances of Christian Bale and Steve Carell. However, what truly made this movie shine was the lively description of so many different little aspects of the finance industry. From the bargaining with clients and the worries of an investment manager that he will face devastating fund outflows to the greed and hubris of the biggest investment bank employees. Yet, despite the fact that there are many things in this movie that you can't understand if you are not strongly familiar with the finance industry, the end and the main message is unambiguous to anyone. In my opinion, this movie got a bimodal distribution of ratings with two means, 9 from people in the finance industry and 8 from the rest.",9,2,3,17 February 2016
