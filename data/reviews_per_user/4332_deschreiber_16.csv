Deepwater Horizon," serious subject turned into empty action flick
","This was a major disappointment. Despite so much of the story depending on technical details, the movie communicated next to nothing. In the early scenes on the rig, people were shouting at each other, unable to understand each other because of the background noise. However, the audience was made to suffer the same thing, having no idea what people were saying. It turns out they were asking if a 'cement test' had been completed, and after some time, after they were indoors and checked with various people, they discovered that the test had not been completed. So why was the audience made to go through the nonsense of not hearing what people were saying? It seemed a ridiculous plot point to portray in such an annoying way. The significance was that the test had not been completed, not that it took a few minutes to find that fact out because it was too noisy outside for people to talk.Then began a number of discussions about technical matters. Little effort was made to help the audience understand any of it. Even the few diagrams and supposed shots of what was happening beneath the waves were far from enlightening. I think we were just supposed to let us the technical talk slide over us as mumbo-jumbo only engineers would understand. For my part, I began to think I'd rather have been watching a PBS documentary about the incident that so that I would know exactly what happened.Once the disaster begins, very little effort is made to continue the narrative. There's a skeleton story of a few crew members saving each other and trying to get off the rig, but the vast majority of the time we just see explosions and flying debris, over and over and over, an endless series of quick cuts, each scene lasting only a few seconds, with lots and lots of noise, of course. Despite the action and colour and noise, it all became a tiresome. At the end of the movie we see photos of the actual people involved in the incident. None of them, of course, looked like glamorous movie stars like Marky Marky or Kate Hudson. The roles required no great acting talent. Did the producers really have to hire big-name Hollywood names to fill those roles (one of the producers was Marky Mark). It seemed to be a great opportunity to use some lesser-known actors.",4,80,156,5 October 2016
Public Enemies," 'Bonnie and Clyde' this is not!
","'Public Enemies' is a real waste of time. Some of the audience left early in the showing I attended, and I could sympathize with them entirely. Story? Were you expecting a story? Bank robber robs banks, gets girl, is hunted by the police. Not much of interest there. Somehow Prettyboy Floyd, Babyface Nelson and Frank Nitti get thrown into the 'story,' casually and for no particular reason. Why they left out Machinegun Kelly, Ma Barker and Bonnie and Clyde is a mystery, and with Frank Nitti in the mix they might as well have given us some Elliot Ness, too. Overblown, Hollywood-style fight scenes? Oh, yeah, everyone and his dog was carrying a sub-machine gun (hmm, in real life I thought it was all Tommy guns with those round cartridge cases during the 30s, but what do I know?), and these were not run-of-the-mill guns, they had ammo and firepower and Dolby noise enough to take out a tank. Bwammo! bwammo! The overkill was next to laughable. A movie with heart - a brutal cop who tried to beat a confession out of the killer's moll is on the point of plugging Dillinger in the back but pales and quivers and looks like he wants to cry when the bad guy turns, looks him in the face, and gives him (shudder) a look. Now that's high drama. Finally, something has to be said about the annoying camera work, shaking and jumping, pointing this way, then that, framing half-faces - and the editing with constant quick-cuts so that for long sections nothing is on the screen for more than 3 seconds. It's one of the worse movies I've seen in a long time.",2,3,8,8 July 2009
500 Days of Summer," non-liner structure was not a plus
","Overall I didn't like this movie much, mostly because I felt the heartache of the guy for 90 minutes, which was not a nice experience. And I fail to see what was added by breaking up the chronology of the story, moving back and forth among the 500 days of their relationship. A simple question - why? Why do that? Why not follow it chronologically, the way it really happened, and the way, after all, we are supposed to fit it all together in our heads as the move unfolds? It just seems an unnecessary gimmick. If it were a mystery movie, or some terribly complicated plot that starts with us in the middle of things having to figure out a world we were suddenly dropped into, then a nonlinear presentation makes some sense. But it doesn't here.",5,1,4,5 December 2009
Midnight in Paris," way, way too cute
","With all the good reviews, I was expecting to like this film. Mostly it irritated me with its cuteness and shallowness.For a start, it makes far too much of the beauty of Paris. Yes, the city is pretty, and the opening shots of postcard-like scenes were charming, in a postcard way. But when the film began to make much--and I do mean much--of the idea that the scenery of a city contributes to human happiness in an important way, it began to annoy. Are people happier in Paris and Rome and Vancouver than elsewhere? Really? You mean they're inevitably and quantitatively more miserable in Nepal, Kyoto, a fishing village in Newfoundland? No, in our hearts we know that happiness comes from other things, from love, family, satisfying work, freedom from tragedy (i.e. luck) and, most important of all, that elusive factor, inner contentment. The prettiness of our surroundings offers at most only fleeting moments of delight, all within the context of a much larger experience. Midnight in Paris present a shallow, tourist's appreciation of life in Paris.When Gil, clearly incompatible with his fiancée, wanders over to a little music store, a woman walks out, young, pretty, they look at each other, they're obviously interested, they exchange a few words, they part, and we absolutely know that the movie will end with Gil leaving his fiancée and taking up with the French girl. Clunk. How dull. The central conceit of going back in time to what was in Gil's mind a golden age has a certain charm, but Allen ruins it by hammering it into the ground, shoving onto the stage every damned famous writer and painter he could think of--the grossest kind of name-dropping, celebrity-watching. Oh, oh, look, there's Hemingway! There's Alice B. Toklas! Aha, Gaugin! My goodness, Toulouse-Lautrec! Really, it becomes quite tiresome.The deep thinking of the film makes the point that every era looks back to some previous time which it regards as a golden age, before the vulgarity and ordinariness of the present. It's a nice thought, worth making. Yet it simply substitutes another escapist fantasy, namely, that one location, Paris, is a golden place, where life must be more vivid, more thrilling, in a word, happier. It's a shallow notion in a shallow film.",6,0,1,13 April 2012
Gettysburg," It's for people who already know the story in detail
","This movie makes little sense for anyone who isn't already familiar with the characters, locations, tactics, etc. of the Battle of Gettysburg. There is so much talk about high ground to the west, divisions coming in from the north, General So-and-So doing this, General Such-and-Such doing that (which side is he on?), that it's quite meaningless unless you already have lots of good background information. To me it looks like a clumsy job of trying to maintain historical accuracy - unfortunately, at the expense of a clear storyline and dramatic coherence.Another major problem is some truly awful dialogue spoken against a background of swelling, inspirational music. Characters pause, stare into the distance, the action around them comes to a halt, and they give long, noble, philosophical speeches. The effect verges on the embarrassing, even the comical. It's just plain very bad, amateur writing.Jeff Daniels does an interesting job of portraying a Union officer with a soft heart.Sam Elliott (Brig. Gen. John Buford), the officer leading the Union troops in the first encounter, is less impressive. He had an annoying habit of, in the middle of a speech, suddenly spitting out a sentence with great force and a great show of passion without communicating any sense of why that sentence possessed him so much. It looks like an actor trying to inject lots of feeling into his words without quite knowing why and where.I watched it tonight for about two hours until bedtime, fairly bored most of the time. There are still at least 20 minutes left, but I turned it off to go to bed. I probably won't bother watching the end.",Null,0,2,28 March 2009
Interstellar," painful and stupid
","First, about the pain, which is mostly due to the sound. I don't know how many times we're in a rocket ship blasting off somewhere with everything shaking, the cameras jiggling, the astronauts grimacing, and the sound track roaring, screeching, thundering, blasting the eardrums—I really did have to plug my ears by the end of the movie. Add to that the so- called music, which consisted mostly of even higher mountains of noise, mostly produced by a big pipe organ pumping out its gargantuan decibels in the form of a few simple chords—hardly music, merely a musical instrument adding to the overall accumulation of noise. I don't think anybody should be credited with creating 'music' for this film.As for the stupidity, I was lured into the theatre by publicity claiming that the film had got the science right, or at least the graphic representation of a wormhole and black hole. Well, the graphics may have been right, but they were pretty standard stuff as far as eye candy goes, hardly worth the price of the ticket. What about the science? Maybe it was correct on every point, or on most points, or only on a few points—who knows? Only someone with degrees in quantum mechanics and astrophysics would be able to judge. For the general audience (obviously, the audience the film was aimed at), the science talk came across as sheer gobbledygook. There was no effort to explain the ideas for the public. The jargon was just spat out here and there with the purpose of raising a smokescreen for the current plot point. Very annoying.I wanted to enjoy this film. I hated not liking it, knowing how much money and effort went into making it. But by the time we got to the last 20 minutes or so, I'd had enough and had to fight the urge to walk out. In fact, I did get out of my seat and watched the last 10 minutes or so from the back of the auditorium near the exit door.",3,55,118,21 November 2014
Nightcrawler," Excellent piece of acting, but pretty standard stuff
","There's not much to say about the story of Nightcrawler. If it rises to the category of satire, as many of the reviewers here think, it's hardly original in attacking TV news for featuring crime and blood as a way to boost their ratings. That's been done a hundred times, and often much better than this. Most of the action consists of a guy rushing up to a n accident or crime scene and pushing his way into the chaos to get video footage. Not much of that sticks in your memory.The movie's one saving grace is the driven, manipulative insanity of the main character. Gyllenhaal has a gleam in his eye that, even in the quietest moments, makes it clear that this guy, for all his attempts to charm people, is crazy and dangerous. There are plenty of time-wasters worse than this.The writers deserve special credit for one scene. The main character's attempt over dinner in a Mexican restaurant to seduce the woman who's in charge of buying his videos is so wacky, so remote from any normal relationship, that it's humorous at the same time that it's appalling. There the dialogue carries the scene on its own, and Gyllenhaal doesn't have much to do beyond speaking the lines.",6,1,1,12 July 2018
Judgment at Nuremberg," great WWII movie, but relevant to today?
","Just about everybody agrees on how important and how moving this film is in exploring the problem of how to assign responsibility for the terrible things that happened during the Nazi era. But, watching it today, I wondered if it overreached itself. The final words of the judge to the convicted Nazi judge are, roughly, 'You became responsible for the millions of victims the first time you sentenced a man to death whom you knew to be innocent.' It's a fine sentiment, and one we hope we would try to live up to today. But how realistic is it? Is it anything more than poetry, high-sounding phrases? If it is truly meaningful, then I don't think the lessons have been learned, because similar things are still happening. While they are not comparable to the atrocities of Nazi Germany, the same kind of corruption is still with us. When America feels threatened by terrorists, its justice department finds legal justifications for torture. In Texas a governor refuses to save a man from execution even when DNA evidence proves his innocence, for political reasons, as the public, frightened by crime, cries out for blood and a scapegoat. The Nazi era came to an end, thank goodness, but its venality, corruption, even traces of its brutality, are still among us today. And, sad to say, they probably always will be.",9,2,4,3 November 2012
The White Ribbon," Did it all lead to Naziism? No.
","A very interesting, atmospheric movie. It sticks in the mind long after you've finished watching it.However, I do taken exception to reviewers who try to connect the culture shown in the film--narrow religiosity, feudal social relations, stiff formality and discipline enforced by harsh punishments in family life--with the rise of Naziism some twenty years later. Most of those features were not at all unique to Germany but were present throughout Europe and North America. Think of the strictness of Dutch religious life, which never produced a Dutch Hitler, or of the sexual repression and cold, formal family life in Victorian Britain. Even in North America, in California, similar conditions were common, as can be seen in Steinbeck's East of Eden. The rise of the Nazis in Germany is well explained by events and conditions following the First World War, without resorting to these vague 'cultural' principles. So what about the submission to authority, as shown in the villagers' unwillingness to stand up to the Baron? Does this lay the groundwork for later compliance with the Nazis? No, that had nothing specifically to do with Germany. Remember the experiment with high school classes in California, when they were divided into groups, one given dominance over another and pumped up with parades, flags, armbands, uniforms, titles, all the paraphernalia the Nazis used for their mass manipulation. The California kids, for all their tradition of freedom and independent thought, reacted just as enthusiastically and diabolically as many German youth did in the 1930s.No, I think this film is not about history and politics. It's about the forces that can appear anywhere and everywhere--perhaps even forces that are ultimately inescapable--that cause people to behave wickedly.",Null,1,3,6 October 2011
Pearl Harbor," the Doolittle Raid section
","Of the 3+ hours of Pearl Harbor a full 1+ hour is spent not on the attack on Pearl Harbor but on the Doolittle Raid, America's ineffective but highly symbolic revenge raid on Japanese cities. It should be a separate movie, and was obviously added by the studio to keep American audiences from feeling depressed at the end of the Japanese victory on Hawaii. Maybe a good business decision, but it was a poor dramatic decision.The 1944 movie 30 Seconds Over Tokyo, with Spencer Tracy as Doolittle, already covered this story, although thankfully without trying to mix it with a silly love triangle. In several ways the old movie outdid the new one, mostly because it didn't use some of the terrible techniques that are spoiling so many movies for me these days. The main thing it avoided is the constant use of quick cuts, one camera shot replacing another after only a few seconds, supposedly to increase the sense of excitement. Unfortunately, it detracts from much of the pleasure of watching this kind of movie, the kind of thing I always enjoy, such as prolonged views of the aircraft and the carriers, the views from the air, a chance to look around and see some of the background details that may be completely miscellaneous but which add to the sense of reality, even if they're not exactly what the director wants us to focus on. The audience can also see that the real purpose of a lot of quick cuts is sometimes to hide things from us, to avoid showing a plane really gunning its engine for a while, trying harder and harder to get up to full power, then taxiing and taking off a short runway, for example, or a real view of Tokyo from the air. Pearl Harbor certainly does offer a lot through the use of computer graphics, but even then it does so only in fits and starts, in scenes that flash by too quickly to enjoy. In 30 Seconds Over Tokyo we fly with the crews for several minutes over the wave-tops toward Japan, the engines roaring in our ears, while in Pearl Harbor the trip is done in a couple of quick cuts. Remember the Bruce Lee movies when martial arts were actually performed in front of the camera and you could see exactly what was happening? Today it's all done through quick cuts and film editing, and you know you're being cheated as you see one snippet of a kick, then another snippet of a back flip, both put together in such a way as to suggest an amazing, continuous action--but it's completely faked.Please, Hollywood, stop with all the quick cuts. Let us actually LOOK at something!",Null,0,0,26 August 2011
Ex Machina," So many people hated this movie - why such a high rating?
","As I scrolled through pages of reviews here, it seemed a majority didn't like it at all. Most agreed with me that the idea had some potential but that the final result was shallow and pretty boring. Visually it was striking, though.If you know the British TV series Black Mirror, this looked like one of their episodes - the same kind of visuals, the same sci-fi mode, the same attempt to be ultimately unnerving.But with so many people voting low, how did it end up with a rating of 7.7? There sure must have been a lot of 8-10s to outbalance all the 3- 6's.",5,3,8,24 August 2015
Lincoln," Let's be honest about this film
","Let's set aside the big Hollywood names acting in and directing this film, forget about its big budget, even forget about the seriousness of the topic. What are we left with, looked at just as a film? For a start, it's very narrow in its content, focused entirely on how Lincoln got enough votes to get his anti-slavery amendment passed. That's all. Despite the grandness of the title 'Lincoln,' it's only about Lincoln in this one small, if important, moment of his career, covering in considerable detail how he rounded up the required votes, how he pressured certain politicians, horse-traded with others, cajoled, tried to inspire, tried everything he could think of to get the votes needed to pass the constitutional amendment outlawing slavery. There are no subplots other than a little to-and-fro with his wife and some brief scenes showing his sons--mere gestures rather than subplots. The film is all about the down-and-not-always-clean vote- gathering business of politics. Once the bill is passed, the film quickly comes to its close, with a few short scenes to bring the war to an end and Lincoln to his assassination.There are very few outdoor scenes. Almost everything happens indoors. The characters are seldom shown other than in their roles as professional politicians. There are no beautiful women, no common people other than in the background, only white guys, just about all of them dressed pretty much the same and almost all wearing big beards. The atmosphere is slightly claustrophobic.The seriousness of the issue and the moral grandeur of Lincoln, (perhaps deriving as much from his historical reputation as his depiction in the film) keep one's interest. Obviously the passing of the bill is a foregone conclusion, so there's no real suspense.I couldn't help imagining this film when it comes out on DVD or in five or ten years from now, when it appears on television. How many people will want to see it for a second time? I don't think many people will. Teachers will use it, but I have a feeling it will be largely forgotten in the world of movies.Are these Oscar-worthy performances? The acting is excellent, but, given the script, they didn't have great potential, and it's hard to see them as extraordinary.",6,14,32,17 November 2012
Pi," stylish, but with a ridiculous ending
","This has the look of an art house film, in black and white, with lots of grainy scenes and shaky camera-work, an anti-hero as protagonist, a genius who lives as a hermit in squalour in New York City's Chinatown, lots of unexplained things throughout the movie. I liked some of it but grew tired of it about half way through.The ending, however, is completely disgusting. Looking for some sort of pattern that will 'explain nature,' the hermit stumbles across the answer when his computer spits out a string of numbers. It does that as it is going into a fatal system crash, just as it's about to 'die.' Yes, die. Literally. I kid you not. We'rre told that in its last split second his computer (a DOS machine with 5-1/4 inch floppies, guffaw) achieves consciousness and sends out its own message. But that's only the beginning of the nonsense. A group of Orthodox Jews are after his numbers, because they are a code for 'the true name of God,' which Jews have been searching for for thousands of years. If the true name of God is intoned by the right person in the right place, it will move the world one step closer to--I forgot their word-- Valhalla, Paradise, whatever. There are also some thugs from Wall Street who want the number because it will enable them to predict the stock market. But now the numbers only exist in the mind of the hermit. What to do? He takes a power drill and drills a hole in his skull. End of plot. In the final scene, he is no longer a math genius, just a guy sitting on a park bench. What a stupid plot. I was disgusted. You may enjoy it if you're prepared for the ridiculous ending.",4,4,7,18 November 2012
Children of Men," What are people talking about? A bore.
","I saw this movie on television and gave up on it after a little more than an hour. I went over to my computer to see if anything was new in my local newspaper. What a bore! Seventy-five million dollars only got you this? For some reason the entire world is going down the tube. Who knows why? Doesn't seem to be connected to the infertility issue. Only Britain (rah, rah) is in better shape; that is, it does have terrorist bombs, the streets are a mess with garbage and graffiti, and the countryside is swarming with murderous outlaws, but at least it isn't in flames like other countries. Our hero is conscripted to escort a pregnant woman to safety. Why exactly does she need protection? Um, I dunno, she just does. Everyone in the movie seems breathless with excitement, which the producers apparently thought was enough to create excitement in the audience. There's lots of chasing, people running and shouting, and I suppose that adds up to gripping entertainment for some viewers, but I'm being generous by giving this turkey a rating of 5 stars.",5,12,19,21 February 2011
The Blind Side," last section is a letdown
","The first part of this film, dealing with the growing relationship between Michael and his new family, was heart-warming and excellent. Sandra Bullock was delightful as the iron-willed Mom. The boy, S.J., was used only for humour, which was a shame. Much more could have been made of the girl, Collins, if only for eye candy and to take some of the spotlight off Ms. Bullock. The Dad was pretty much a non-entity. But I thought by far the best part of the movie was about the relationships among all these people. Did everything really go that smoothly inside the family? I doubt it. A lot more could have been done with the family.Nevertheless, I was moved by the film. Then came the football part, which was pure Hollywood schlock. Oh my goodness, it's the big game, and guess who's not succeeding? I think I'm gonna have a heart attack. Time's running out. He's going to fail, he's going to let everybody down. Oh, no! But wait. Wait! Can it be, is it true? Glory hallelujah, in the nick of time, he's redeemed himself. Cue the victory music and crank it up loud. Ycchh! For me all that entirely predictable storyline, that stale old sequence seen in hundreds and hundreds of movies coming out of Hollywood, purely paint-by-numbers plotting, took a whole lot of the polish off what otherwise could have been a much, much better film. Shame on the scriptwriter who let himself be talked into that junk.",7,0,0,16 January 2011
Before Sunrise," Stop talking, stop acting, go away!
","This is one of those ideas that looks good on paper but is a gigantic bore on film. Bore? No, worse than that - major annoyance. You follow a couple through a day as they meet, become attracted to each other, walk around, talk, share ideas and experiences and feelings and experience love. Aww, ya can't not like that, right? Well, yes, you can. After half an hour I wanted to run out screaming. They may both be attractive young actors, but as time went on and I had to watch their faces FOREVER, without a break, without anything else breaking the focus, I couldn't stand seeing them any longer. And their voices, their voices! endlessly yakking away so earnestly, so incessantly, started to sound like fingernails scratching on a blackboard. I just wanted them to shut up. Then there was the look on their faces as the listened to each other, their faces responding to every nuance, listening so intently, so yearningly, with so much empathy and sympathy and understanding and two hearts beating as one ... Help! Let me out of here! Is this love? Sure, probably it is, but if it is, it's definitely something to be experienced, and enjoyed as a participant, not watched as an outsider, especially not watched so long and so closely as this movie forced you to do. You know when lovers call each other 'pookie' and 'snookums' and 'koochie,' how it's terribly affectionate and heartfelt and meaningful to them but you want to retch and just get away as fast as you can? That's how this film affected me. I still shiver at the thought of it. I'm not sure I'll be able to enjoy another movie with either of these actors in it.",2,7,14,7 February 2010
