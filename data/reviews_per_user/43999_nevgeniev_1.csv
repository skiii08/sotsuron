Iron Man 3," waste of time
","What a disappointment!One and a half joke for the entire movie stretched up to 2 hours.Flying lego & depressed iron man what a drama! :) Hats off to Ben Kingsley who was the only actor in this movie. Without him I would rate it one star, but unfortunately he had just around 10 minutes of screenplay.The only wish is that IM franchise will be closed now as the spirit of the IM is gone and there is no difference whether you watch IM3, last spiderman or batman they are all the same.if the only thing you care is sound & color splashes then this movie is for you. if you liked IM 1-2 for the irony and humor just don't waste your time.",2,0,3,5 September 2013
