The Devil's Advocate," I just love Keanu with a Southern accent!
",I love this movie except for the violence-but it is definitely fascinating to watch. Keanu looks great and I find nothing in this script predictable. Except that Pacino is Way over the top. Very scary special effects and a deftly executed 'Bobby in the Shower' ending.,9,1,1,8 January 2003
