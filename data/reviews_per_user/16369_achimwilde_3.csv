The Blair Witch Project," Didn´t work for me
","<<< May contain spoilers >>>I´m sorry, but The Blair Witch Project just didn´t work for me. Maybe it´s because I knew that it was fake before I actually saw it. Thus, all I got to see was three kids trying to scare me with a flashlight in the dark, panic cries and wooden sticks hanging around in the woods. And of course the low optic and acoustic quality which made an utterly boring movie unbearable. The ending sucked, too, I was neither frightened nor surprised. Though I have to admit that it may work for some people, I have to give it 1/10 points because I couldn´t enjoy watching it in the least.",1,12,22,27 May 2002
Unbreakable," Even a lot worse than Sixth Sense
","Easily one of the worst movies I ever saw, and the slowest for sure. And I know why it was so slow, it´s because it was so empty, the whole story can be told in just a couple of words. The entire movie was like it was filmed in slow-motion. Boring to the bone. I usually never know when there´s a plot twist ahead (which was the only good thing about 6th Sense), but this one I saw from miles away. And it has the cheapest depiction of a train crash ever: A simple fade to white. Unbearable, 1/10.",1,3,7,28 January 2002
Mission: Impossible II," No surprises
","<<< May contain spoilers >>>I expected nothing of what I expect from a good movie, like a story or believable characters. The hype around this movie was overwhelming, and all you saw in previews was split-second long bits of action sequences.I didn´t know a thing about the story, and hey, why should they have told me of it anyway? The virus story was just a way to connect the cheesy action and to bore me to death. I usually don´t foresee even obvious twists in the story, but when there was only one injection left, I knew some good guy would be infected and the next step would be to get the antidote. I don´t mind plotholes (Matrix was full of them and I still loved it), if the rest makes up for it. I never saw the old series, but I saw the first Mission Impossible movie, and that one had a story. It was clever and confusing, which made it interesting. MI2´s story was just dumb, pointless and boring.Same thing applies to the characters. Cruise is Cruise, all right. But did he really HAVE to pretend he was James Bond? The chick was just a chick falling in everlasting love with Cruise in no more than a second, the 'team' could have been played by the computer and the bad guy, he just sucked, he had no charisma.Last thing, the action. I believe that action itself is boring, unless it is really impressive and shows you something you haven´t seen a hundred times before. I liked the scene in the first movie where Cruise was hanging from the ceiling, not being allowed to touch the ground. It was so quiet in the theater, you could hear the people breathing. In MI2, there was just the fast-and-loud action that doesn´t allow any details. And the guy-and-chick-car-chase-on-mountain scene, tell me in how many James Bond movies we saw that before. *yawn*2/10, for the car exploding on the bridge and the girl´s t-shirt.",2,0,0,5 November 2001
