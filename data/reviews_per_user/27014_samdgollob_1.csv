3:10 to Yuma," Ignore EVERY review that says this is a good movie. It's objectively NOT.
","One star for acting, one star for cinematography.
-8 stars for the lack of any sense to the plot or the characters' reasoning. A few examples:
A vicious murderer is only handcuffed at the front, and no one ties him up after he disarms and harms people MULTIPLE TIMES.
Characters change their motives on the dime, have the thought process of 10 year old boys, and act in total contradiction to what they did before.",2,0,5,9 July 2019
