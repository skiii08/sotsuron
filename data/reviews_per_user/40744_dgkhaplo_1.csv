Marie Antoinette," #1 Make out Movie of the year
","Rip Torn aside, I thought the acting was great. The wardrobe was great. Even the dogs were great. But I totally missed the story line. Was it 'Let your brother talk to your spouse and explain sex', or was it 'How to be a lush', I know! It must have been 'The life of a bad queen'. I love a good story more than anything else and to me it doesn't have any sort of plot or story line. I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for something to happen, for something to get good, for something to go bad. It's the only thing that kept me in my sit, but then the movie just ended. The wife and I talked about it on the way home. It's the first time even she has said she wanted to walk out of the theater. I guess if you liked it great for you, this was just my opinion. The worst movie I have seen to date.However, I think you can take a date to this movie and play kissy face for almost 2 hours and not miss anything. When asked what the movie was about just tell people it's about a bad queen and a sissy king. Then the movie just ends.",1,2,7,29 October 2006
