The Lobster," Really bizarre but quite good
","This is a pretty good piece of movie. It is the most bizarre movie I've ever seen in my life but it deserves to be watched. Everything is odd, the screenplay itself and also the characters. It seems like everything has no meaning yet with a straight basic outline.I would rank this movie in the surrealistic genre because everything seems having no purpose at all. And the end scene confirms that thinking.Therefore, this movie marked me psychologically unconsciously. Indeed, after watching that movie at 3AM, I had a quite peaceful night but with dreams as bizarre as this movie. Every actions the characters did I did them in my dreams. This was really odd. And that is partly the reason why I liked this movie.",7,0,4,26 February 2016
