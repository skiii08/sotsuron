Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't blame critics!
","Critics wanted more than anything to love this movie.  As did many die hard fans who simply couldn't forgive storytelling that is not on par with it's predecessors.  THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE of critics being closed minded and braindead!  If some dogmatic viewers simply open their eyes, they'd see it's not just the critics.   As for the people who loved this movie, well... some people liked the Fifth Element, so I guess its possible to love this.  One problem for me is the screenplay of Episode one gets bogged down in minor details, and doesn't move from scene to scene with effective pacing.  I don't think its boring, but I will say, it's less exciting, and captivating than it should be.  Too many of the scenes are about small details that don't really have to be there, i.e. so many of the chase scenes against the droids, and the land battle with the Gungans.  That to me was not exciting. The action is more routine here, and doesn't have the element of surprise like the others.  Things get shot, things shoot back, things blows up, things shoot, etc.  It gets very monotonous.   I did very much like the scenes on Tatooine, however.  I think it did capture my imagination, with the exception of that amazingly overrated pod race sequence, complete with obviously CGI characters, and a Pod racer that kills the entire scene for me.  This isn't a bad movie, it's just a disappointment.  This feels more like a 90's movie.  Which place their emphasis on routine action, and effects, and less on character, and interesting backstory.  Watching resent action movies, I always thought to myself, where's the magic that I used to see in movies starting with Star Wars in '77 and pretty much ending with Back to the Future in 85. It appears, that Lucas has fallen to the same mistakes as the so called enemy 'the big studios' likewise. Nothing against George. He is a wonderful guy. A smart guy, and I think it's too bad that so many disappointed fans have been SO grating on him personally. If I was let down by his movie, and even the next installments, the man still has a heart of gold, and once made pictures that defined the magic of cinema to me. His filmmaking here seems to lack passion, hopefully, he'll get that back with avengeance.  Overall, what I think of this movie?  There are moments, and enough of them, for me to say, heck, it's pretty good.  But I can't help thinking what this could've been.",1,3,6,4 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," pretty good
","This, more than the others Star Wars films, most resembles the old sci-fi serials it was based on.  There are a bunch of nice little action scenes, few of which appear to affect the long term plot.  It did not have the magic of the original series, but was always interesting to look at.  It appears that, Lucas had most of his ideas set for Episodes 2&3, and degenerated this script into a not too exciting, spiritualy deprived thrill ride.  I hope it works for some people.  Honestly, I thought episode one was the instalment that was supposed to throw the whole story into motion.  It doesn't really accomplish that goal.  This feels like it could've been an Episode 2,3,4,5,6, but not an opening.  Though I enjoyed this, I seriously doubt the film will be remembered as the others are.  But, maybe after 16 years, mister Lucas needs time to warm up.  Here's hoping for Episode 2!!",1,0,2,19 May 1999
Man on the Moon," Carrey, an Oscar? Injustice!!
","Is Carrey good in this role?  Yes.  Just as he was in Truman Show.  But there is something separating him from the great actors.  He is trying to hard, he is acting too much.  Too many exaggerated expressions, and not enough of a real breathing human being.  Granted, Kaufman was aloof, but when the gaurd went down, he was closer to normal, a little shy and awkward, but normal.  It was a great task for Carrey to master the vocal tones of Kaufman, and he is much toned down from that mug fest Liar Liar, but he's still not there yet.  I think he'll get there, but not yet.As for the movie, I thought it was good.  I'd say wait to video.  I think a lot of people will hate this movie, because it's not a laugh fest.  It's a drama basically.  But it did not strike me with the same conviction as did The People vs. Larry Flynn.",2,5,11,26 December 1999
