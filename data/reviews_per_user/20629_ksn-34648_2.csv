Blade Runner 2049," Good filmography, Pretty Women ... And That is it
","This film reminds the world of two things:1- Hollywood releases these sequels to make money and only later starts thinking about characters, reason or plots.
2- Reviewers are operating on payola and get paid to give very high marks undeservingly. Movie critics are the Fox News of cinema. They lie from morning to night and don't even break a sweat. We would do well to ignore the liars.The women were flaunting and free, the planet was interesting to watch and I felt otherwise everything was inferior.",5,3,5,14 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I have a theory why this film is so stupid and boring
","Rian Johnson (whoever that is... an alias?) is working for Jar Jar Abrams.After the failure and fiasco that was JJ Abrams' reboot of Star Wars and its Disneyfication, they release this to make Episode VII look not so bad.
No dice, Jar Jar and Disney. We are on to you and your stupid film crushes Star Wars, crushes any reputation you have left with anyone either older than 4 or IQ higher than 50 and most importantly means many will be awakened and not go watch your monthly Marvel releases, further (so-called) Star Wars and other crap you release.The bombs you were dropping in space were on your own bought and paid for 'careers.'",1,1,1,14 January 2018
