"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Distracting enough, but unlikely to stay in the memory for very long
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Dennis (Simon Pegg) suffers nerves on the last minute before his marriage to Libby (Thandie Newton) and does a runner. Years later, he's stuck in an unsatisfying job while she and their son are shacked up with successful business tycoon Whit (Hank Azaria) a charismatic American with lots to offer. But older and wiser, Dennis vows to get his life back on track and win Libby back to him by doing the unthinkable...running the London Marathon! I had meant to go and see Rendition but I fancied a laugh so I went and gave RFR a go instead. Unfortunately I payed for laughs but got rather little of them, as well as a slow, slumberous story that takes far too long to get going. I was also rather surprised at how liberal our censors appear to have become. The film is rated 12A, meaning moreorless anyone of any age can see it, but the amount of times the F word is used, along with a lot of the sexually explicit jokes, really made me wonder.Performances wise, Pegg just ain't up to his Hot Fuzz standard, Newton manages to be little more than attractive eye candy and David Walliams makes his standard cameo appearance in a bakers shop.There's quite a lively soundtrack going on and it's an amiable enough ride to the end. Plus anything I say isn't really going to make much difference because the film's been showing for well over a month now and by the looks of it is still really continuing to rake it in. The British really like to flock out to have a laugh at one of their homegrown comedies, but seem to overlook all the flaws with them. **",4,4,13,21 October 2007
The Blair Witch Project," It's a woman's world...
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable.****Very Good.***Okay.**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead.*Avoid At All Costs.Let me just start by saying,I could'nt really review this movie properly,because near the end I had to leave the auditorium because I was.... well,I don't have to go into it.Luckily,I only missed a little bit,but either way ,the producers get some diss points knocked off because of this slip up on my part.From the most of it I saw though,was rather unique.There have been similar documentary type movies,but on those they somehow managed to hold the camera still a bit better.I was'nt exactly uplifted by all the juggling and throwing about.The first unsettling part was the noises outside the camp.Yet,I don't know,maybe it was because there was no tense music,but there was,strangely enough,less tension in seeing what was presumably the real thing on a hand held camera than seeing it in a fictitious hollywood production,whenever those scenes arouse.I suppose the most revealing part about it was that it was a woman leading the expedition into the woods.Whether going up against nucular terrorists,going in the army,or losing it beyond the boundaries of the human soul in the woods,sisters are doing it for themselves in the movies more and more and more these days.So,ultimately,not the scariest movie ever for me,then.And what on earth were they running and panting away from in the tent?Or were we just not meant to know to add to the suspense?***",Null,0,1,31 October 1999
The King's Speech," A fine lead performance makes this an unusual film choice for me
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1930s England, King George the Fifth (Colin Firth) has succeeded to the throne upon the abdication of his brother, and the fate of the country now rests on his shoulders. However, a speech impediment renders him unable to perform his public duties to the fullest, and is the cause of much embarrassment. Defiantly proud, but mindful he needs to do something to improve his problem, 'Bertie' enlists the help of unconventional speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush.) The pair enjoy a difficult and frosty relationship to start with, but over time come to form an effective and unbreakable partnership that takes both men to places they never thought they would go, as war with Germany looms on the horizon and the public need a leader more than ever as the thirties close.The monarchy, whatever your politics on it, undoubtedly provide this little island of ours with it's broad sense of history and tradition, and will stand us in the annals of time for quite a while. From this vast catalogue of stories to pick from, this little number pulls out the last individual to sit on the throne before the current one, and highlights the little touched on fact of his struggles to communicate, in private and in public. Such an idea might seem like a curious one for a film idea, but it's brought to life quite well by Tom Hooper, which is as fine an indicator of talent as you could hope.To be honest, this generally isn't the kind of film I would choose to watch of my own accord, but lead star Firth's performance had received so much acclaim and looked like it had the potential to be so great, that I decided to give it a go. And Firth does not disappoint, delivering what must surely be one of the defining performances of his career, bringing the king to life with all his ticks and mannerisms just perfectly, and just generally managing a guy with an horrific speech problem and his attempts to rid himself of it quite commendably. He's complimented by a fine supporting cast, most notably Rush as his eccentric but caring aide, but not forgetting the likes of Deek Jacobi and Helena Bonham Carter.Even if this is the kind of thing you'd usually avoid like the plague, the great performance of the lead actor is reason enough to go out of your way with this one, and all the awards and rave reviews it's received should bear testament to this. ****",9,1,2,20 June 2011
The Avengers," Flashy, extravagant uniting of the comic book heavyweights
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), head of defence agency S.H.E.I.L.D., is thrown into action when a powerful device called The Tesseract is stolen by Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the renegade son of Odin and a wicked God banished for his nature. He calls all the superheroes together from around the globe to unite as one to save the Earth. But upon Loki's capture, they start to question their assignment and whether they're being told the whole truth.Superhero movies seem to be the in thing at the moment, the big studios still requiring a guaranteed fan base and surefire box office return in these recessionary times. And so some bright spark in the marketing department had the foresight to imagine them all coming together as one, supposing the ardent fans would go crazy and flock in droves to the theatres to catch it. While personally I prefer the action films more grounded in reality, there is still a young boy in me who can still find an appeal in the flashy suits and fantasy adventure. It says a lot that Avengers Assemble, where all the big Marvel comics names (with the exception, sadly, of The Punisher whose antics would probably have been too violent for a family film) manages to be more of an exhilarating thrill ride than all the films from recent times that inspired it.Joss Whedon has crafted a colourful, flashy sensory extravaganza that brings the characters to life in ways none of their first recent outings could and never manages to drag at quite a bit over two hours. Working together as one, the gang manage to be more effective than they ever could on their lonesomes, forging an unwitting chemistry together as events roll on, while you can never shake the feeling there's a part of them that would still like to rip each other's throats out. Luckily, Whedon never forgets to inject the script with flashes of humour at regular intervals, resulting in material that never takes itself too seriously (unlike maybe some of the original films), which sets it on the right track.While the all star cast all manage to bring their respective characters to life in their own way, it's probably Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man who steals the show, firing off a wise cracking charisma through out that makes him stand out, while Scarlett Johansson is an alluring femme fatale, and Hiddleston is a hissable villain. Meanwhile, other big name stars like Jeremy Renner and Mark Ruffalo are pushed further back and occupy less screen time. But casting aside, the main thing here, the action and special effects, are appropriately spectacular and round off probably the most satisfying film I've seen in this series. ****",9,1,5,30 June 2013
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Pointless, boring sequel that's pretty much a waste of everybody's time
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) and his father Patrick (Jon Voight) continue to teach the history of American forefathers. But one day a general by the name of Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) calls the good name of Ben's grand-father into question, claiming he was in on Lincoln's assassination. Unable to accept such a slant on his grandad's name, Ben sets out to find the three pieces of a piece of paper that will prove his innocence. His quest takes him to three corners of the globe, including his native America, France and London. Along the way, Patrick is forced to reconcile with Ben's mother Emily (Helen Mirren) and Ben must reconcile with his love interest from the previous film Abigail (Diane Kruger) as well as his friend Riley (Justin Bertha) all whilst being pursued by FBI Agent Sadusky (Harvey Keitel.) It all builds up to an 'explosive' finale where Ben must kidnap the president (Bruce Greenwood.) Critics have been pretty unanimous with their condemnation of this unnecessary sequel to the only marginally enjoyable 2004 film National Treasure. But this big, sloppy mess only serves to make that film look like a masterpiece.An overlong, overblown, totally boring piece, despite a slick car chase action sequence filmed in London, the weak, apathetic plot and lame script cause you to lose interest very quickly indeed, meaning before any other hot action can creep up towards the end, you've either fallen asleep or are clinging on by a thread. It says a lot that such a nifty cast list, from Cage to Keitel, all seem as bored as the audience, with no real passion for the film emerging from any of them, definitely one they all seem to have just done for the paycheque. In charge of such a sinking ship of a script, director Jon Turtletaub can only do his best to guide the awful mess in the best direction he can, which isn't very well at all.Hopefully, this will mark the end of Cage's sub par Indiana Jones impression once and for all. *",2,5,9,4 June 2008
Angels & Demons," Similarly flimsy second instalment of the Robert Langdon series
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is called from Harvard once again, this time to help investigate a series of murders in Verona that appear to be the work of a maniacally religious group called The Illuminati. He joins forces with Vittoria (Ayelet Zurer) the daughter of one of the victims, who's pretty smart herself and they race around trying to find clues while trying to stay alive themselves.Dan Brown, like Stephen King, doesn't seem to translate well to film. Or at least, they don't under the direction of Ron Howard. Having failed to make much of an impression with the first and most well known of Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series, The Da Vinci Code, he's seen fit to return as director for this second inslalment. And the result is something even more flimsy and unremarkable than that.I didn't actually manage to finish Angels and Demons (the book) to anywhere near the end, but already the downsides of The Da Vinci Code, in the shape of trite dialogue and thin characterization, were in evidence. This time around though there didn't seem to be much of an inspired or intriguing story either, but I'd still be willing to bet it was more fun than this film. While it's still fairly intelligent and complex, it manages to get bogged down in the hoo hah of all the clever symbols and texts, getting the viewer to try and join the dots to everything that's going on while not providing much in the way of genuinely thrilling excitement.As the star of the first film, Hanks was practically guaranteed to jump on board in the follow up, looking grateful for the nice pay cheque but just going through the motions and delivering nothing like his most dynamic of performances. Even a colourful supporting cast, including Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller Stahl can't inject any more life into it. For all it's shortcomings, again it looks like the book's your best bet. **",4,0,0,15 November 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More satisfying than the first instalment
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsHaving mercilessly dispatched the first lot of those who wronged her in the previous film,'The Bride' (Uma Thurman) returns to take out the remaining villains,culminating with her former boss,the titular Bill (Kung Fu film star legend David Carradine.)The first film was more enjoyable on a trashy level,with all the unashamedly ultra violent sword wielding action going on.This,the second instalment,satisfies on a more deeper level,with greater attention payed to dialogue and atmosphere,and in turn making it an ultimately slightly more absorbing experience.For all this,however,we fail to learn much in the way of motivation or depth to the story and characters until right at the end in the shape of an over-bearing,laboriously droning one-to-one between Thurman and Carradine.Tarantino meant these movies as homage,and it's clear that perhaps he got a bit too carried away in this world.However,it's not a completely regrettable experience.There are fine performances all round,from Thurman especially,managing the hard-ass kick ass chick stuff (especially striking during a sequence shortly after the opening credits featuring a black-and-white Thurman driving her car talking about how she has one more person to kill) as well as the more emotional range.That's not to mention all the frenetic,ultra flashy martial arts action that occasionally pops up,nowhere near as consistently as part one,but just as impressive and mesmerising.****",Null,1,3,14 May 2004
First Man," Well made, assuredly handled biopic
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the 1960s, NASA is preparing one of the most audacious exercises in the history of time, the first manned space mission to the moon, on the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), one of the candidates up for selection, is still recovering from a traumatic personal tragedy, but displays an aptitude and ability that sets him far apart from the other test pilots putting themselves forward. As he prepares to take the lead in an endeavour that will push the boundaries of what was thought possible further than ever before, he must contend with the inner dynamics of NASA, the social upheaval of the time and his own conflicts in his personal life.I often wonder if the present generation would feel more inspired to aspire to greatness and really dedicate themselves to what was possible if some great, magnificent event were to occur that opened their eyes to what can be achieved with determination and dedication. Instead of pandering to be on the next vacuous reality TV show or going on some demonstration about largely perceived racism or climate crisis, something like the moon landing could motivate them, something that still stirs the pool of wonder today, with various people even claiming that they were faked.The actual moon landing itself is fascinating enough, but Armstrong the man behind it is also has dynamic potential for the story , a studious and slightly nerdy man who developed the personality to command the mission to the moon. Gosling's physical resemblance to the man helps no end, and his performance is thankfully assured and convincing. Reuniting with La La Land director Damien Chazelle (making his second feature film), their respective roles within the production combine to produce something markedly different from their last outing.In the end, it's just not exceptional enough to truly linger in the memory, but it's involving, well acted and examines a fascinating real life character/event that were two parts of one of the defining moments of our age. ****",9,1,1,13 January 2020
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Sentimentally engrossing story
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsHaving directed Brad Pitt in A River Runs Through It,Robert Redford directs Matt Damon in The Legend Of Bagger Vance,a sentimental,warm hearted tale with a stern hint of life's misapprehensions at it's core.Indeed it is very pleasant,with some beautiful cinematography and engaging ,thoughtful performances.However,it gets kind of long and drawn out towards the end,and the end outcome is pretty obvious if you think about it.Still,Will Smith carries on from Enemy Of The State in proving he's got versatility as an actor aside from comedy films,in a cliched but thoughtfully pinned role as the mystical caddy arriving to aid Damon's struggling former golfer.Charlize Theron is also stunningly beautiful in her role,at one scene revealing herself in sexy lengeraie which should set pulses of the male viewer's running.The film is interestingly told from the perspective of an aged golfer suffering a heart attack on the golf coarse at the opening of the film,reliving his experiences as a 10 year old boy at the time the film is set.A sweeping score accompanies the proceedings ,nicely rounding off the film's whole.A tee in one,or whatever.***and a half.",Null,4,8,4 March 2001
Black Swan," Driven more by style than character, this will alienate some but pays off if you take it all in
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Nina (Natalie Portman) is a shy, nervous girl whose passion is performing ballet. In the face of stiff competition from more confident, forward girls, she wins the lead role in an up-coming production of Swan Lake in New York City, when demanding instructor Leroy (Vincent Cassel) drops older performer Beth (Winona Ryder) and invites her in. It's from here she becomes friendly with co star Lily (Mila Kunis), a more spirited girl who evokes emotions in her previously untapped. But the better Nina does, the more she is pushed and the more her strive to achieve perfection drives her dangerously over the edge and she finds her sanity waning.Despite the rave reviews and the numerous awards they've won, I saw neither Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler (which makes this film even stranger!) or Black Swan at the cinema, and had to wait to see them on DVD. This may make their scope smaller to me in the eyes of some, since being on 'the big screen' is what the 'big films' of whatever day they're released in most will remember seeing them on. Luckily, Aronofsky, whichever way you look at it, is a director with talent, and he makes films where this manages to shine through in whichever format you see them in. There are a good few who would have missed his smaller, more independent but critically acclaimed effort Requiem for a Dream (which I've never seen!) but The Wrestler managed to be a far more mainstream effort and was an undoubted work of brilliance, one of, if not the, best film of the 00s many claim. But while that worked as a character study of a man adored by loads he doesn't know but seen as greatly flawed by those who are supposed to be closest to him, Black Swan is a film driven more by atmosphere and claustrophobia, or rather an impending and illogical sense of these things. In many ways it is also a character study, of a girl with great untapped talent and potential, whose innocent and sincere determination to be the best at what she does, at odds with her deep insecurity and fundamental lack of belief in herself, pushes her over the edge, but it's delivery, at least at the beginning, is as such that it makes it hard to get into and may alienate some viewers from the off set.That the performances are so fantastic is for sure a bonus point, Portman in the lead role great as the central protagonist, a Carrie White style character still living with a domineering and controlling mother (Barbara Hershey) who hasn't let her really grow up and experience the world, whose shyness and vulnerability never really seem to go away as she progresses further and has to battle with her mounting delusions, and secondary mentions must go to Cassel as the archetypal slave driving instructor, a man prepared to push his lead star to a nervous breakdown in his quest to get the best out of his play and, more selflessly, her, while co stars Kunis and, in a far more minor role, Ryder also compliment the overall flavour of things. Unlike The Wrestler, it doesn't work as well telling a story as it does being a movie revolving around a sense of style and atmosphere that may be lost on some but which is there if you pay close enough attention. ****",Null,1,2,24 July 2011
Changeling," Strong, compelling performances are the main thing that drive this typically great Eastwood production
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Based on the true story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) a single mother in 1920s Los Angeles whose young son goes missing. When she gets a call to say he has been found safe and well, she is overjoyed...only to find the boy is not her son. When she brings this little matter up with the chief of police, she finds herself thrown into an insane asylum. The outraged Rev. Briegleb (John Malkovich) begins a campaign for her freedom, and when she is free, she continues her fight to find her son and expose the corruption and shame of the police force.Fact, as they say, is often stranger than fiction. If Clint Eastwood's true life justice drama were a work of fiction, there would be numerous plot holes that could be brought up, such as the mother not being able to prove the boy was not her son with a photo or other people not being able to verify her claims. But if the front cover says it's based on a true story, who am I to argue with it? A real 'you couldn't make it up' plot line, this story served as the wake up call that changed LA's mental health policy forever.Aside from being an unbelievable story, it's also an uneasy and disturbing one, and an air of disturbance and unease hangs over it through out. Long and drawn out, the smooth pace and expert story telling never make it feel a drag. Of all the stars, Eastwood gets his best work out of lead stars Jolie and Malkovich, who both deliver strong, powerful performances, but that's not to say the supporting cast aren't on fire either, including Colm Feore as a police captain and Devon Conti as the oddball accused of unspeakable crimes.It's a story that had to be made into a film and in the hands of a pro like Eastwood, it didn't go wrong. ****",9,3,4,8 April 2009
Scarface," A quintessential gangster movie
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Since they're two of the most renowned actors of their time, I often think, as a serious movie buff, who I prefer. Al Pacino or Robert De Niro. Due to sheer scale of number of films I've seen, I usually tend to go with De Niro. But then I think, have I seen enough films from either actor to really make an informed decision? Nah, I've seen enough of De Niro's movies, but maybe not enough of Pacino's. Twenty five years after it first came out, I finally saw Pacino in one of his most revered roles, that of Cuban gangster Tony Montana, who cockily built up a massive cocaine empire in Miami in the very early 1980s, only for his greed and recklessness to blow it all.While the film itself is impressive enough, and Pacino's performance carries it wonderfully, it's definitely Montana the character who made the film so memorable for so long. Representing the dark side of the American dream, where anybody can be somebody doing anything, the frowned upon exile from Castro's Island, seen as rubbish heaped upon the States in exchange for some political agreement, with his cocksure, arrogant attitude epitomises the 80s ideals of greed and excess, much like his contemporaries Gordon Gekko from Wall Street and JR Ewing from Dallas. Allowed to grow obscenely rich from his ill gotten gains in the all-for-yourself era, his urge to make noise is apparent before big success happens, driving around in his cadillac with it's tacky, Del Boy style interior furnishings, right through to his giant in-door jacuzzi when he's made it big. Never afraid to show the darkness of the crime world, the film is at times brutally violent, with a brutal mid air hanging from a helicopter, through to an explosively violent finale where those he has crossed catch up with him in his tacky big house, ending up with one man with a giant automatic weapon taking on a whole army of machine gun toting lunatics. Brian De Palma reliably stamps his unmistakable style all over it, while the tone may feel a little too light at times, it's none-the-less an essential part of making the film what it is.An unforgettable film that's left a permanent mark on the crime movie genre, Scarface has lost none of it's power quarter of a century after it first came out. *****",10,0,1,15 December 2008
Frost_Nixon," Inevitably a little dull in parts but still an undeniably good film that holds your attention to the end
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1974, David Frost (Michael Sheen) a bright, up and coming young TV presenter, made history by arranging to interview soon to be outed President Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) at an address over in the States. With his most famous achievement, a once popular game show over in Austrailia, on the brink, this interview hinged on Frost's career. But interference from hanger's on on Nixon's side and Frost's lack of bite during the interviews held things back- until the final of the interviews was held in 1977 and Frost finally backed Nixon into a corner, leading to one of the most explosive controversies of all time.Ron Howard's account of the history making event when President Nixon was backed into a corner and let out the dreadful blooper: 'when the president does it it's not illegal' doesn't seem to have attracted any bad reviews and could quite well attract some Oscar nominations. It's undeniably an ambitious, daring and provocative piece with some strong performances and it deserves a lot of it's acclaim. But it's still a film where the emphasis is on talking, and not so much action, which won't make it the most exciting of films with some.But, as I say, strong performances play a big part in moving it along. Langella, who I best remember as Skeletor in Masters of the Universe, is dynamic as Nixon, catching the huff and gruff of his manner and delivery perfectly, and setting you back when he raises his voice and shouts at those around him who he thinks can see where his anger is coming from. As Frost, Sheen compliments him perfectly, as the reserved, reluctant to offend but not quite meek young reporter who has to grow and find the confidence to really take Nixon to the dogs. And what a fine supporting cast, including Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon and Mattthew Mcfadyen, who as the supporting players give the film a weird (and I'm not sure completely necessary) docu drama feel as their characters give talking head moments about what went on at various points in the film.So, a well made, interesting and dynamic film but sadly, all with talk and no action. Which might just make it boring to some. ***",7,2,7,31 January 2009
Walk the Line," Well-made docu-drama that deserved it's Oscar nominations
","STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh A drama depicting the life of famed country/rock and roll singer Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from his childhood days growing up on a ranch in Arkansas, where he tragically lost his older brother in an accident involving a saw, his time in the Air Force, trying unsuccessfully to cut it as a door to door salesman before striking it lucky and getting a hit record. From there, the glory of fame has it's highs and it's lows, including a dangerous drug dependency.So many films get released nowadays it's hard to keep up with them all, but James Mangold's drama of the late, great rock singer Johnny Cash Walk the Line is one I'd heard a lot of praise for but had yet to get round to getting up off my butt and going to see. It did well at the Oscars too, certainly getting a few nominations in.One thing it can boast is great performances. Phoenix captures the spirit and dash of Cash quite well. I don't know if he met the man before he died or not, but he's just as compelling as Jamie Foxx was as Ray Charles or Will Smith was as Ali. I liked Reese Witherspoon in the supporting role as well, very pretty and giving a colourful portrayal of the love of Cash's life.The film is a thorough re-telling of Cash's life, not done with as much emotional gusto as I'd have thought and dragging on a bit towards the end (over-stretching it's running time I'd have said.) But it's undeniably well-made and deserved it's Oscar status. Well worth seeing. ****",9,0,0,1 July 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Unrelentingly outrageous and daring but unbelievably funny as a result
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Borat (Sascha Baron Cohen) opens his film in a village in his impoverished homeland of Kazahkstan, from which he plans to travel to America and film a documentary of him and his friend Azamet (Ken Davitian) exploring the American way of life and trying to blend in. Unfortunately it proves to be a none stop assault of very embarrassing cultural misunderstandings and differences which Borat cluelessly stumbles from one to another of. Things get even more anarchic when Borat develops a crazy dream of marrying Pamela Anderson after seeing her on Baywatch and gets Azamet to start travelling, in their ice cream van, to California instead of New York.Four years after the Ali G movie proved to be a (fairly) big success at the pictures, Sascha Baron Cohen now delivers a movie adaptation of his second comic creation Borat, who premiered on an episode of Da Ali G Show (but never proved to be quite as successful or influential!) Having said that though, the cards of fortune have been reversed for Borat here, because his movie proves to be just a little bit funnier than Ali G Indahouse, which means it's quite possibly one of the funniest films I've ever seen.The film simply refuses to draw a line at what too outrageous is, with some (hilariously funny) but cringe inducing jokes involving sex and genatalia, bodily functions, unintentional offensiveness and outright arrestable behaviour. It's not hard to believe that the Kazahkstani locals (amongst others) at the beginning of the film could have been exploited by the film-makers into making complete fools of themselves for peanuts and if this is true you can't help but feel sorry for them but the simple fact is no matter what lines the film crosses, no matter what boundaries it's willing to break, it just never stops being anything less than laugh out loud hilarious.Probably the first high light of his career, Larry Charles has here delivered a film that he will come to always be remembered by. So guide Borat into your funny bone and let him take you for a drive. *****",10,4,15,5 December 2006
The Incredible Hulk," If you weren't a big fan of the original, chances are this won't float your boat that much either
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Hiding in Brazil since the last film, leading a lowly life as a bottle processor and learning ways to control his anger so he doesn't become his huge green alter ego, Dr Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is found after some of the serum he uses to control his anger accidentally lands in one of the bottles. The United States Military, lead by General Ross (William Hurt) swoops in on him with no mercy and so it begins a desperate chase back to America to evade capture. But aside from rekindling with old flame Betty (Liv Tyler) Banner faces a newer, more deadly adversary in the shape of Blonsky (Tim Roth) a Russian soldier who has been injected with his own serum, which turns him into The Abomination, The Hulk's deadliest foe.While Ang Lee's original adaptation of Hulk was not an awful film, it didn't make enough of an impression on me to make me drool with excitement when the sequel came out. And so it passed me by in cinemas and has only now just caught my eye on DVD. Lee's passed directorial duties on this one to known action director Louis Lettirier...who's produced an even more under-whelming result.As well as a new director there's a new lead star (there must have been some falling out on the set of the last film) in the shape of Norton, who's maybe a bit too deep for the role, approaching it like it's Hamlet. All of the supporting cast make a bit of an impression, Roth especially, and lets not forget the surprise cameo at the end by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark (although hearing Stark Industries mentioned earlier does get the mind wondering) unsubtly opening the door for another sequel. But the story just fails to hold your attention through-out, something not even lifted by the numerous special effects, save for a tasty end showdown between Hulk and The Abomination, as they stampede through the streets, crushing cars, smashing buildings and generally making a lot of mess.This is really no 'incredible' hulk. Nor a jolly green giant. Not even something in between. **",4,0,2,26 January 2009
The Monuments Men," Clooney brings the old time war movie back to the big screen
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As World War 2 draws to a close, and the allied forces draw in on Germany, Major Huey Lewis (George Clooney) brings his own daring mission to the forefront: retrieving stolen artworks that the Nazis have pilfered by Jewish artists, to either be destroyed or usurped by Hitler and placed in his planned Fuhrer Museum. He assembles a ragtag squadron from different units (and even different armies) and they are plunged into a desperate race against time to save the works before it's too late.The terrible antics of ISIS have been in the news lately, with their various atrocities around the world, but mention was given to the ancient monuments they smashed to pieces in the Middle Eastern countries they've invaded, representing centuries of culture. It's a tactic they've obviously taken on from fanatics of time gone past, not simply wanting to eradicate a whole race of people, but also all the items of value that their culture produced, so that they're dead in people's memories, as well as physically. George Clooney's full bodied, all star homage to gung ho, cavalier war films of times gone past, takes the traditional war film, and applies it to a different type of story.An all star cast, made up of mostly older heads, with Matt Damon probably being the youngest, adds to the old fashioned feel of it all, with John Goodman before he lost so much weight, and Bill Murray, who can wonderfully channel the same expression to convey feelings of laughter and feelings of sadness. Adding to the Sunday afternoon feel of it all is a lack of depiction in the brutal, blood drenched reality of war, just ambling along and telling the story the way it would have in the 40s and 50s. But it is Clooney's show all the way, his affection for the type of film he's copying the style of beautifully evident.It's all wrapped up quite wonderfully too, unlike a lot of war films at under the two hour mark, making for a much more condensed affair. I'm not sure why it's attracted as much scorn as it has. All in all, it's a pretty forgettable experience, with nothing to really make it stand out from other films of it's type, other than being about a mission to save paintings than people. In that sense at least, it's daring and ambitious, and while the results are pretty hit and miss, it's no more hit than miss. ***",7,0,3,1 December 2015
Mission: Impossible III," Just a big load of meaningless Summertime pap, nothing more
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits IMF Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back-this time on the trail of a merciless arms dealer (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who's implanting deadly devices in people's brains in order to obtain what he needs.Six years after the last movie, Mission:Impossible III hits the big screen. But from it's opening weekend onwards, it has been performing disappointingly at the box office and causing cynics to question Tom Cruise's reign as the king of the blockbuster. Whether it's just people getting fed up with this type of movie, or whether Cruise's antics in interviews and on TV on behalf of his Scientology medium have just put people off anything to do with him, we don't know but Mission: Impossible III looks set to be both a financial and, from the look of it, critical failure.Even most of the stunts and special effects on display are strangely unimpressive. Maybe I'm just fazed by movies like this, but they all went right over my head. Even if they themselves had blown me away, although the conclusion is obvious from the off-set, still it doesn't matter how outrageous or spectacular the stunts become, there is never even the slightest element of danger that he will come out from his ordeals dead or even slightly scathed.Coming from someone who's never actually seen Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut or even Born on the 4th July, some might find this a bit presumptuous, but as I've said before, Cruise has always struck me as more of a 'movie star' (suited to this kind of thing) than an actor and he's rather at his wooden worst here. Hoffman is actually a high-point as the villain, managing a very cold and humourless but ultimately rather empty and cardboard character. Support from Ving Rhames, Laurence Fishburne and Simon Pegg is standard but does nothing to raise a dead rat script any further out the gutter.Overall, this is a very empty and unaffecting experience indeed. It's only May and if these are the type of Summer blockbusters we've got to look forward to, I don't hold out much hope for those released in July or August. **",4,9,19,19 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Slightly corny and uneven but a very well-written tale
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Slevin (Josh Hartnett) has had a run of bad luck recently (from losing his job to getting viciously mugged) that has culminated in him getting mistaken for a man wanted by a couple of mob goons, The Boss (Morgan Freeman) and the Jewish Schlomo (Ben Kingsley) over a massive unpayed debt. To clear the slate, he is asked by TB to assassinate the son of Schlomo in an on-going mob feud. A mysterious hit-man named Mr Goodkat (Bruce Willis) and a spurious detective named Brikowski (Stanley Tucci) also get thrown into this convulted story where nothing is as it seems.The cast runs from one end of acting greatness to the other, from the acclaimed Willis, Kingsley and Freeman to Hartnett, still working his way up the acting tier.At times, a lot of the dialogue gets layed on a bit too thickly and in turn sounds a bit corny, but it is sort of admirable in it's way. What the movie can boast above all else is an intelligent, well conceived plot full of twists and turns that require your full attention to the end, when it all gets revealed as just another big revenge storyline of the type that's been coming out of Hollywood a lot lately (a few years after 9/11.) Some rather big flaws, then, but still a very rewarding action thriller with a clever plot. ****",8,3,11,11 March 2006
Captain Phillips," Competently done, highly serviceable account of real life drama
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningCaptain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the captain of the US flagged MV Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship cruising around Somalia towards the Horn of Africa. Whilst the mission is underway, Phillips receives a lengthy e- mail warning him of the dangers of Somali pirates striking in that region, which his crew all too quickly become aware of. And sure enough, from a tiny, impoverished village in Somalia come a group of desperate men, who take over the ship, plunging Phillips and his crew in to a desperate life or death battle that will test him as a leader to the very limit.Only a few months ago, I noted how a big budget, glossy Hollywood production was in motion, on the subject of Somali pirates seizing cargo vessels around the Indian Ocean, in my review of a smaller budget, Danish production that had impressed me. There may be something of an arty film snob brewing in me that had me convinced this film wouldn't match that film's quality, and in a way, it doesn't. But that's because it's simply an impressive film in and of it's own. While it's inevitably on a much larger scale and has received much more publicity, it's in the hands of United 93 director Paul Greengrass, who manages to still keep something of a down to earth look to it by using a shaky cam. The way the drama unfolds does have a little more of a Hollywood feel to it than the Danish film, what with a big dramatic build up to the hijacking, rather than in the European film where we just see it happening without much fuss. But that doesn't make how it unfolds any less ominous, as there's an unnerving claustrophobia to the scenes where Phillips is on his own, glancing at the long e-mail or as we see the little ships on the radar and from the ship's deck, hurtling towards their target.After all this about the similarly themed Danish film, I feel it necessary to mention at this point that this is not a remake of that film, and is an account of a completely separate real life hijacking, that being the first at sea hijacking of an American vessel in many years. Hanks is pretty much the go to guy for this kind of role, and has done his research and rehearsal as reliably as ever, getting Phillips's accent right and enveloping himself in the role and the drama it invokes. But he's playing it off against a host of young Somali talent, who may struggle to find work as high profile as this again, in key roles as the hijackers, who sadly suffer the Hollywood effects of the film by being portrayed as more hissable and ruthless than they were in the Danish film, which probably more realistically showed them as only slightly less desperate and scared than their captives, but that's not to say Barkhad Abdi and Barkhad Abdirahman don't get quiet, soulful moments to reason with Hanks and show their more human side, even if there's nothing like the borderline Stockholm Syndrome there was in the Danish film.It would be easy for anyone who'd seen the Danish production to let out their cynical side and frown at a Hollywood stab at what it was trying to do, but the talent involved are professional enough to ensure it doesn't descend into anything overly glamorised or corn fed. ****",9,1,2,28 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Quite good.
","For a U certificate movie, the plot was a bit hard to follow and it was very noisy. But the characters were good fun.  Darth Maul, for the limited screentime he had and for the few lines he spoke, was impressively cold and unrelenting and was played with impressive uncannieness by Ray Park.  Another favourite of mine was Jar Jar Binks.  Very funny and intelligently written. Qui Con Jinn (Liam Neeson) was no Obi Wan Kenobi but still lasted as did Ewan McGregor, the last person in the world who I thought would star in it.One of the problems here is the pace,which dos'nt always keep up and sometimes allows the movie to drag on a bit,especially towards the end.The special effects, however, kind of redeem this.I was impressed with the pod race, especially.Ultimately, I admire this movie's attempts.  But it's not always that successful and doesn't, of course, live up to the originals by a long shot.",Null,0,3,20 August 1999
Sucker Punch," Stylish, entertaining graphic novel adaptation
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A young girl (Emily Browning) who comes to be known as Babydoll, finds herself institutionalised in a mental asylum by her wicked step father, which is a front for a gentlemen's club, run by the slimy Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), where girls are forced to perform erotic dances for the amusement of rich men. After being put on the spot to perform her first dance, Babydoll finds herself transported to a mystical fantasy world, where she finds herself under the tutelage of the Wise Man (Scott Glenn) who teaches her to place her mind where her body isn't. From here, Babydoll hatches a plot to break herself and her fellow dancers free.The graphic novel adaptation craze, started by Robert Rodriguez with 2005's Sin City, is still alive and kicking, as evidenced by Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, which from the opening already appears slightly lost in a case of style over substance, with the blurry, grungy cinematography and deep, heavy goth soundtrack not promising much in the way of an engaging story. But stick with it past this little hurdle and there's a more enjoyable, traditional action thriller to wit here of a group of heroes, here quite pleasantly in the shape of some sexy girls in kinky outfits, taking down a dastardly villain. It's gained some criticism for it's content being a 12 certificate film, and it is easy to see why this is, given the girl's dress sense and some of the quite explicit violence in parts.It's a bad omen, but probably the most impressive thing about the film is the special effects, stylish, impressive CGI action set pieces, including dragons, fighter aircraft and Nazi trenches, brought to life with a colourful, vibrant quality that makes the film work where it was meant to. Snyder has worked his Watchmen formula to a film not quite as violent or graphic, but which still packs quite a powerful punch, with a plot in reverse twist at the end that helps it make sense a bit more.Unlike Watchmen, it's wisely a lot shorter and therefore more palatable and works a bit more where that film didn't. The characters are certainly more pleasing to the eye, and to be honest so is the action, so even if it isn't perfect, you're on to a far surer bet with it. ***",7,1,2,12 January 2012
3:10 to Yuma," The western makes a seeping comeback...
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Notorious outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) finally slips up when he and his men try and highjack a Pacific Western train carrying buckets of money belonging to the treasury. The authorities catch him and want him sent on a 3:10 train to face trial in Yuma. They persuade struggling rancher and former soldier Dan Evans (Christian Bale) to escort him, which he agrees to do to set some things right in his life. But as he learns about Wade on the trip cross-country and his philosophy to life, his loyalties and duties become sorely tested.The western is a genre that's starting to crawl back out of it's cracks recently, what with Tommy Lee Jones's 2005 offering The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada and now this slightly more mainstream offering. No doubt written off by many as a thing of the past, back when Clint Eastwood was a big star, this distinctive type of film is thankfully slowly starting to see the light of day again.Director James Mangold has captured the essence and spirit of the genre wonderfully here, crafting a slow, atmospheric and undeniably tense film with great casting in the shape of Crowe and Bale as the respective villain and hero. The story is engaging and well written and keeps you gripped to the end.It doesn't quite come off as a brilliant film, but on the other hand there's nothing really to complain about with it. A strange thing to say, I know, but all you can do is see it for yourself and make of it what you will. ****",9,2,4,11 May 2008
The Equalizer," The greatest action film in a very long time
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) was an ex CIA operative with a lethal set of skills, who quietly left the agency and settled in to a quiet life working for a Home Department store. But when he strikes up a friendship with Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a young girl aspiring to be a musician, but entrapped to some vicious gangsters, he finds himself forced to employ the skills from his past life once again, setting him on a collision course with Teddy (Marton Csokas), the gangster's brutally efficient enforcer.Adapting an old TV show from the '60s seems to be the norm these days, which on the surface doesn't offer much in the way of surprise or even excitement in The Equalizer's way. But left in the right hands for a change, everything's come off a treat, and the result is a solid, effective action adventure, that evokes great memories from the good old days when action was at it's height.Over ten years after Training Day, Denzel and director Antoine Fuqua have re-united and re-created that hard-hitting, superb magic once again, only this time with Washington in the hero role. And how finely he fits it, too, perfectly fitting the character and suiting his physical requirements down to a tee. He is matched by Csokas as the bad guy, the best in a long while, eerily menacing, methodical and suddenly shocking with his unassuming moments of enraged violence. Unlike many modern directors, Fuqua is not brash, and allows his story to take it's time and progress at it's own pace, with a proper beginning, middle and end, stretching at over two hours, but never weary or dull, and culminating with one of the best action sequences in a long while, with a Home Department store being turned in to a battleground, with a selection of DIY equipment not really being used for their intended purpose.The names involved should have got my senses buzzing more than they already did, but thankfully I was not disappointed. This is just the best action film in years, brutally violent, intelligently written, well directed and polished with a slick veneer. It's good that it's taken so long to getting round to writing the review, as it's given me more time to rave about it as much as I should, and give it the justice it deserves. *****",10,2,6,19 July 2015

The Expendables 2," Slightly superior to the first, but still makes you yearn for action's hey day rather than re live it
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter a successful mission in Nepal where Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) was rescued, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his team of 'expendables' are celebrating a job well done. Until his old love/hate friend Church (Bruce Willis) tracks him down and offers him a job in exchange of avoiding prison: travel to China and retrieve a suitcase containing nuclear launch codes. The mission goes well, until him and his men find themselves accosted by Jean Villain (Jean Claude Van Damme) and his team of mercenaries, and one of their men is killed. Gunning for revenge, the group learn the villains are heading to Russia, where the suitcase contains the go codes for some buried plutonium.The original Expendables film had unlimited box office potential in a number of ways. It set itself up very unpretentiously, a simple, no brainer, big budget action flick where head honcho Sly reunited all his old action buddies from the 80s/90s, and delivered a load of what the fan base had come to expect and demand, with some self depreciation par for the course. While I was left a bit underwhelmed by it, it certainly worked wonders at the box office and gave some long forgotten stars another big taste of the big screen again (even if it didn't quite re- ignite their careers there.) So, of course, a sequel has come along, albeit with new director Simon West (which naturally gives it a less of a feeling of being an ego trip) and extended screen time for giants of the genre Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.The action delivers as thick and fast as you'd imagine, but it's all slightly too noisy, harshly filmed, lumbering and unsubtle, bigger and badder than the old days but not better. The script tries it's hardest at decent dialogue, but it really comes to life with the obvious but admittently rib tickling in jokes and self sending up (to wit, at the end, Arnie telling Bruce he'll 'be back', only to be told he's 'been back once too often, let me be back for once.' His answer? 'Yippee Key Eh'), which adds to the welcome feeling of it all not taking itself too seriously. The best thing about it is actually Van Damme as the villain, surprisingly charismatic and convincingly sadistic, while new comer Scott Adkins also displays some un nerving presence as his henchman. Unbelievably (and certainly sadly) the worst thing about it emerges as Chuck Norris, not on his part but at the way his character ridiculously emerges out of nowhere while all the action's going. His presence here just feels like an unsuccessful send up of his Lone Wolf McQuade character, and it doesn't work.West's style and delivery make this emerge as more of a success than the undelivering original, and while it's still not the action masterpiece I wanted it to be, it's still a fair bit above bog standard. ***",7,1,4,21 August 2012
War Dogs," Undelivering, scattershot true life dramatization
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the summer of 2005, David Packouz (Miles Teller) makes a living on Miami Beach, giving back massages to wealthy clients for peanuts. Then, at a family funeral, he crosses paths with Efram (Jonah Hill), a brash young guy of about the same age, whose made a killing by making online arms deals of depleted army stock that the US government no longer needs, and wants to bring him in on the deal. But as the boys delve deeper into this murky world, the risks get greater and everything conspires to fall apart around them.When it comes to war, and the politics and motivations behind it, we're living in a far more cynical, acutely self aware age, where people are no longer falling for the jingoistic, stirring rhetoric used to whip up support for it, and can see beneath the surface of what it's about just fine. And so a different type of film emerges, in the shape of War Dogs, where our heroes aren't rounded, noble figures, but shady, arrogant ba$tards who are really operating behind the scenes. Sadly, despite the potential, the film isn't the soaring hit it should have been.Director Todd Phillips seems to have a background in mainstream comedy films, including The Hangover series, and while this is billed as a comedy itself, the darker tone and more uneasy subject matter make it harder to see in this way. Performances wise, Hill has never played his obnoxious American arsehole act to such great effect, making his Wolf of Wall Street character practically Paddington Bear, whilst Teller provides fine support as the slightly more restrained other guy. There is a neat sense of style, savvy Goodfellas style narration and some cool dramatic moments, but none of it comes off in quite as coherent and satisfying a manner as one would have hoped.If you want a film with a morally conflicted protagonist making a killing during war time, Lord of War with Nicolas Cage (which, ironically, was released in the year the film is set) is a more satisfying option. **",4,2,5,17 July 2017
Source Code," Offbeat, far fetched tale that does keep a nice air of mystery about it
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens to find himself on a commuter train, opposite a woman named Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who claims to know him well, but who he can't remember. Shortly after, the train explodes, killing everyone on board except Colter, who wakes in a pod like chamber where he appears to be under the control of a mysterious organisation. He learns he is virtually brain dead, but the small part of his brain that's still alive (like the inside of a light bulb after it's been switched off) is being used to go back in time and stop a terrorist attack taking place.It seems if Hollywood isn't relying these days on resurrecting old franchises with a loyal fan base to make easy money, it's throwing up the most obscure, far fetched ideas to a modern audience that probably likes to challenge itself, with films such as Inception and this rather less complicated but still far flung and vaguely nonsensical tale that is all too much to take in at first glance.Still, it pays to stick with it, since it does generate an air of mystery and even a bit of suspense as it goes on, even if some of the character motivations do seem as slightly ridiculous as the story itself. You could be more critical and call it an absolute nonsense, but it's just too intelligently done to fall under this category. And despite lacking in humour through out, there is an optimistic, happy ending that results in quite a nice pay off. It would just be nice if Hollywood films weren't aiming for quite so much of the grey matter these days. ***",Null,0,2,10 September 2011
Skyfall," Not the classic some have said it is, but still a superior, spectacular thrill ride
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJames Bond (Daniel Craig) is presumed dead after a mission in Turkey ended with Agent Eve (Naomie Harris) making a fatal error. Of course, he's survived and has simply been skulking around, living in the shadows. Which is just as well, after a major terrorist attack rocks London. Knowing no other agent can match his wits (even if his physical fitness reports aren't what they should be!) M sends Bond to Shanghai to retrieve a list of other potential targets. But the elusive terrorist mastermind Silva (Javier Bardem) has a bigger fish to fry- a grudge against M and MI6 that can be settled in no way other than blood.In an age where long established franchises are seemingly the only thing that makes the box office tills clatter and cling, it must have seemed odd for film connoisseurs that such a long period of time passed (four years, no less) since Bond's last, highly disappointing entry Quantum of Solace passed. Production difficulties were stated (but, basically, they just didn't have the money!) but, good things come to those who wait, and Skyfall will no doubt be more than what the really devoted fans were expecting, even if a really critical guy like me couldn't quite call it a classic.I would personally hasten that Martin Campbell could have done a better job directing, but Sam Mendes is a more than competent choice here. Even if he allows the pace to drag in parts, there is enough sweeping cinematography, awe inspiring spectacle and lavish action set pieces to keep the fans on edge. Like the best of the modern action films, it also never forgets to be relevant and topical, with the plot centring as it does on terrorism and M's speech justifying her agency, stating how 'the enemy today cannot be seen and is not known.' Less than ten years after July 7th, some may find it a bit hard to stomach, but others will find it lends added tension and razor sharp realism.Cast wise, Craig is still a fine Bond, even if the script cleverly prods at him getting older, with his character not passing his fitness reports and Ralph Fiennes's character hinting his job is 'a young man's game.' Few will forget his performance in No Country for Old Men, so Bardem is an inspired choice for the villain, really keeping the viewer in suspense dragging making his presence known out. Harris is a steely, feisty Bond girl who comes to have more relevance at the end when Judi Dench's M takes a surprising turn.Like many films nowadays, it may be one I need to see twice, but sadly on first viewing I couldn't quite take it as a classic. Still, for sheer spectacle and as a sheer cinematic experience, it's a must, with Adele providing one of the most soulful, stirring theme songs in ages. ****",9,1,10,1 December 2012

The Hangover," One of the more inspired and successful comedies of recent times
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning There's lots of places I'd like to visit in America, with it's fifty one states and stapling as the most powerful country in the world. But Las Vegas, to be honest, has always stood out as one I could quite comfortably avoid. The emphasis to me has always seemed to be on the casinos, and I've never gambled in my life (well, I've brought the odd lottery ticket.) But of course, there's also plenty of super hotels, nightclubs, world class shows...the place would seem to have something for everyone. But, from the sweeping over shots on the opening of The Hangover, my main problem with it now is that it all looks too over whelming to me, with bursting visual stimuli coming from every pore. 'Designed to inflame the senses' as Ned Flanders well described it in an episode of The Simpsons. 'A place where it's against the law to be responsible' as Piers Morgan more worryingly described it in a recent newspaper article for the Mail. Aya Napa and Ibiza are wild enough for me, but if you had the time and the money, just how out of control would things be if you had your stag night in Vegas? There's people in the world that could do that, and that's the high concept idea of this film.How wild it gets is that the groom Doug (Justin Bertha) goes missing...that's without mentioning a trashed hotel room, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, a stolen cop car and the naked Chinese man (who turns out to be a camp Triad boss!) who jumps out the boot. Somehow smooth Phil (Bradley Cooper), charmless Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and meek Stu (Ed Helms) must make sense of it all while searching for their friend who's getting married in less than twenty four hours. It's such a simple but effective idea that probably works so well because of it's what if?...potential. Men together are laddish and egg each other on, and just how out of control could things be and just what would the consequences be? Of course a lot of the humour is facile and over the top, but it works well with the tone of the film in that's the mindset of the men involved and quite often the film is pant wettingly hilarious.The director (who luckily has a string of well known credits behind him) has taken a cast of unknowns and produced a highly successful high concept comedy that's inspired and original and like the best of them nowadays, about as politically correct as a drunken Roy 'Chubby' Brown. As such, it's definitely one of the better comedies of recent times. ****",9,6,10,19 March 2010
Child 44," Considered, sobering, if a little plodding
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the early 1950's, the Ukrainian people are living under a regime of forced starvation under Josef Stalin. Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy) is a dedicated officer in the army, who's suspected of being a traitor for not turning in his fiancÃ© Raisa (Noomi Rapace.) However, he's soon ruffling feathers again when he starts drawing attention to a series of child murders that appear to have been taking place along the train tracks. He finds himself transferred from Moscow to a different area, where he is met with resistance from General Nesterov (Gary Oldman), before a climactic final showdown with the killer.Serving as a kind of alternative period piece, Child 44 transports us back to a most grim of periods, which is captured in pretty much every aspect of its production, whilst relaying a fairly typical detective story. A film set in the grimmest of times telling an even grimmer tale. Generally speaking, it's not a film to have a laugh with. It's captured most effectively in the drained, gloomy lighting and dark cinematography. The script is equally humourless, which perfectly matches the already established mood.Since the tone has been captured so perfectly, all that remains to be spoken of is the writing and performances. Spreading out over a long time frame, it's an intelligently written piece if sadly a little dull, without the nail biting suspense consistently injected into the script to make it really effective. Performances wise, Hardy does a decent Russian accent and appears as committed to his role as any other, a feat matched by younger (and now sadly less relevant) version Oldman. A lively supporting cast, including Joel Kinnaman and Vincent Cassel, keep the project charging down the tracks.It's a decent mystery thriller, then, if a little long and dull, and very little to laugh at. ***",7,0,2,24 January 2016
The Ring," Slightly flawed,but generally effective Hollywood re-make of cult Japanese horror film
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsInvestigative reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) loses her niece under mysterious circumstances.A short while after her funeral,her young son Aidan (David Dorfman) starts behaving disturbingly and she learns of the existence of a video tape that supposedly kills its viewer seven days post watching it.Initially sceptical,Rachel digs a little deeper in to the claim along with her seperated husband Noah (Martin Henderson) and unravels some disturbing evidence that suggests she may be wrong.There were a couple of things clouding my judgement of this film before I'd even seen it.Firstly,it's a re-make of an original Japanese film and I was constantly dogged by the feeling throughout that I was just watching a poor glossy Hollywood imitation of a much better foreign film,much like the under-whelment I found after I enjoyed the 1993 film The Vanishing,only to learn it was a re-make of a French film of the same name (and by the same director).Secondly,the premise did seem rather far-fetched and preposterous.However,having watched the story unfold before me,The Ring did ultimately emerge as a very engrossing affair,with a premise that was just about on a par for a horror film,especially if you enjoyed a flick like 1992's Candyman.The film knows how to build it's suspense scenes successfully,creating a nervous sense of impending menace that does a fair bit to move you to the edge of your seat.It also offers a nice visual feel,especially in it's imaginative editing sequences and the dour filming style.When the scene comes when the contents of the tape are shown to us for the first time,the subliminal images we see and the way in which they are conveyed truly suck us in,especially when we associate them with the forboding mystery we are to learn about.The scares are extremely well-orchestrated,and so,of course,are all that more effective.On the performances front,a no name cast carry off a worthy script convincingly,with all the right elements invested in their performances to keep us glued to the screen.There are one or two minor hiccups with the end result.It's a little overlong,with an unnecessary last few minutes tacked on that lumbers us with an ending that leaves us a little short changed and out in the blue.There's also a rather cliched use of a little boy as one of the main protagonists that's been seen in one or two too many horror films in the past (The Sixth Sense and Identity,being two of the most recent) to have any effect.But generally speaking,it's superior Hollywood horror fare,genuinely frightening and unnerving,very well-made and a very successful translation of something that (sigh) I just know was probably much better the first time round.****",Null,0,1,22 January 2004

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits The film opens with our hero, Indy Jones (Harrison Ford) on one of his expeditions in the caves, which nearly goes disasterously wrong. But he survives and is back to his day job as a lecturer at a high school. But it is there that he is approached by a group of men to hunt down a mystical ark that will point in many directions when shone under the sun. But along the way, old flames, murderous Nazis and treacherous foreigners all conspire to stand in his way.25 years ago, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas teamed up with leading man Harrison Ford to bring us Raiders of the Lost Ark, a film that 25 years on, is still hailed as a classic of it's sort.Ford's a good choice of lead for this sort of thing. As an actor he's not particularly expressive, but as an action hero with presence he does just nicely. But he's one of the main commendable things I could find with this film.As a big grand spectacle it may be something, but it doesn't develop the most engaging characters or story to go along with it as we just sort of 'open up in the action', with Ford and some cohorts on their first big grand adventure. When the action scenes do arrive, they are fairly spectacular, but they're strangely unplentiful and one or two of them are a little bloody and violent for a PG film.I know this is a film with legions of fans and there are some 'classic' movies I've been able to get into and accept as brilliant. But maybe Indiana Jones will be one of those ones that just doesn't rub with me. ***",7,0,2,14 February 2006
Deepwater Horizon," Efficient, well handled but not completely satisfactory dramatisation
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In April 2010, on the titular oil rig off the coast of Mexico, the worst oil disaster in US history occurred, that cost seven lives and had enormous environmental and sociological repercussions for months afterwards. Peter Berg's film follows the story of Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg), an oil worker whose job has estranged him from his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) and young daughter. He and site inspector Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) raise concerns about the lack of training of the crew, and the inadequacy of the safety checks, but BP crony Vidrine (John Malkovich) insists the job goes ahead, leading to the cataclysmic disaster which they are lucky to escape from alive.Before this year's second Mark Wahlberg/Peter Berg true life tragedy drama Patriot's Day, they had made this account of a major disaster that occurred at the start of the decade, but still rings a solemn chord in the hearts of many today. Like the aforementioned film, it provides plenty of meat on the bones in terms of potential for making a film, a story of gross corporate negligence and blue collar sacrifice that was begging to be told. Whether it's been made by the most competent crew is for the individual to decide, but it's certainly got an all star cast at its dispersal to cover plenty of ground.Berg certainly succeeds in building up plenty of tension and anticipation of the main event, establishing some believable, accurate depictions of everyday, blue collar rig workers going about their normal business, slinging their normal slang/banter and venting their usual spleens. And when the big explosion does arrive, it still takes its time before enveloping into the big, earth shattering spectacle that it is even if, like Titanic, it's bad taste to think 'wow' about it, since it's a reflection of a real life tragedy. In spite of this, the characters themselves do feel a bit Hollywood stereotype, especially Wahlberg's impeccably selfless hero. It would also have gained a bit more dynamism if it had shown some of the aftermath of the tragedy, in the shape of the courtroom dynamics between the BP executives and the aggrieved workers/families. This would arguably have made for a more interesting film all in itself.It seems as if Berg/Wahlberg may want to make a franchise out of these dramatisations of real life disasters/heroism. He's not really the best director for it and he's not really the best actor for it, but their ambition to shine a light on the plight of the downtrodden victims is still admirable, and this is still an efficient and well handled effort. ***",7,0,0,7 June 2017
United 93," Will be on my film of the year list, I'm sure of it
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A re-enactment of the terrifying events abroad United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11 2001, as several suicide bombers took control of the plane and attempted to crash it into The Pentagon. Due to the courage and determination of a group of passengers, the plane never reached it's target but unfortunately all the passengers on board were killed. Juxtaposed with this story is that of those working in the control tower and their desperate struggle to maintain order and their sanity as the terrifying events unravel.The five years since the biggest act of terrorism America (and indeed the world) has ever witnessed have flown by. And film-makers (and potential film-makers) have actually shown an admirable deal of restraint in waiting so long before inevitably a film detailing these events was made. It's a controversial project that Paul Greengrass has taken on but from this, you get the impression no-one could have done it better if they'd tried.United 93 is such a brilliant film because I struggle to think of a film that has succeeded so well in what it was setting out to do before. Because of the subject matter, it could never be described as an 'enjoyable' film, but it re-creates what must have happened on board that flight so meticulously it is genuinely almost as if you were actually on board the flight yourself at the time. There's no Hollywood style sensationalism or sentimentality, those trapped on board and those scurrying around on the ground all behave as humanly and realistically as though they were re-enacting a story on Crimewatch, their disbelief and horror captured magically. Even the terrorists themselves are given a wonderfully human edge, as we see their fear and apprehension, without ever being made to pity them the way we pity the other passengers. Their brilliantly human behaviour makes the tension on board the plane absolutely palpable and, as I said, feeling as though you could just as easily have been on board the plane with them.It's a lot of little things that roll United 93 along. The opening featuring an overhead of the New York skyline at night as we hear Muslim prayers being sung by the terrorists in their rented hotel rooms gives a creepy and quietly foreboding sense that the big, bustling city where so many people are walking about minding their business and no one suspects a thing is under threat, the use of a digital camera, adding immeasurably to the 'real' feel the film has and the sudden ending which doesn't delve into the aftermath and make the film become sappy in any way. The film-makers set out to achieve a desired result and they got it spot on with this. If it's not still on my top ten list by the end of the year, something really brilliant will have to come along to knock it off. Never an easy or enjoyable film, but a brilliantly real one that genuinely plays as though someone recorded the events on board that plane for real and played them back to a shocked audience (though such a thing wouldn't be empirically possible, of course!) An absolute must-see. *****",10,26,53,27 June 2006
Deja Vu," An overlong, far-fetched thriller that drowns in it's own preposterousness more and more as it goes along
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington- sure I've heard that name somewhere before???) is a Federal Agent called in to investigate when a New Orleans cruise-liner goes up in flames and terrorist activity is suspected as the cause. He crosses paths with Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer) who he starts to work with and slowly piece the case together. But when the charred body of a young woman who appears to have been killed before the explosion is found, he falls even deeper into the case. Then Pryzwarra introduces him to a new technology that causes a ripple in time and see dreadful events before they've even occurred. So now Carlin is faced not only with the possibility of investigating the crime but going back in time and stopping it ever happening.In between making big 'event' movies and Oscar contenders, Denzel finds time to make pot-boiler thrillers like this and the (fairly) recent Out of Time. Not bad filler stuff, perhaps, but Deja Vu is a film that starts to drown so far in it's own ridiculousness that at over two hours it's a rather long slog to sit through.It's a less flattering patch on Denzel's CV just as much as on director Tony Scott's. And yes, you probably do get the impression you've been here before with this kind of film. **",4,1,3,15 August 2007
It," Impressive, rewarding re-boot of the epic King tale
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the small town of Derry, Maine in the 1980s, a series of children have gone missing, including (through creative licence) George, the younger brother of Bill Denbrough. Bill is one of a group of kids who've banded together and called themselves The Losers Club, due to their respective characteristics that make them social outcasts. Whilst they dodge various obstacles, including school bullies and abusive adults, they are drawn into a battle with the perpetrator of the missing children, a demonic clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), who only they can see through their youthful minds.Well, in recent times it's harder to think of a project that has generated quite as much anticipation as Andy Muschetti's big screen adaptation of Stephen King's 1986 novel, which the near breakdown of the internet on the uploading of the first teaser trailer bears testament to. After years of speculation and lingering in 'development hell', to the point where it almost seemed it would never be made, finally it is here. It will have the biggest impact with big fans of the book, but, perhaps more significantly, of the original 1990 TV movie with Tim Curry (including myself), whose performance as the iconic Pennywise would seem impossible to better.While Skarsgard doesn't better Curry's performance, in his own way he at least equals it, making the role his own and having an undeniable presence and charisma to be a scary Pennywise for a new generation, even if his costume does look like a Smiffy's Alice in Wonderland costume for clowns. Being a younger actor than Curry, he brings a more naïve, childlike persona to the role, and is a lot less frequent on the wisecracks. Comparing the two performances, there's definitely a Jack Nicholson/Heath Ledger thing going on, with Muschetti aiming for something more darker, from the central performance and from the material, displaying far more gruesome and unsettling things from the book that the 90s TV film wouldn't allow, not to mention more extreme swearing from the kids.The shifting of the time period from the 1950s to the 1980s isn't a problem in and of itself, if you overlook the different social attitudes and customs, and one can only surmise Muschetti was trying to appeal to a more modern audience by doing it. Their different personalities made each of the seven losers so unique, and here the individual traits that made them who they are are explored in greater depth, something that extends to the bully Henry Bowers. And, Skarsgard's performance allows Pennywise to blossom into a truly solid character of his own. Unlike the individual flashback to childhood from adulthood segments of the original series, this tells the childhood part of the story all at once, for a flat out 135 minutes, something Muschetti will probabl repeat with part two. On the basis of this, that's something we can all look forward to. ****",9,20,43,10 September 2017
Hereditary," Well made, acted and fairly unnerving, but a tough one to get your head around
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAnnie (Toni Collette) has recently lost her mother, a cold, distant woman who seemed to have something to hide. After attending a session for those struggling with loss, she reveals a long history of tragedy that has plagued her family line, only to then suffer one of the worst tragedies imaginable. After becoming friends with a lady at the sessions, Annie becomes obsessed with channelling the after-life, leading to husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) to question her sanity. But something much more creepy and sinister is at play...Horror is a genre that's become pretty generic and production line, a less demanding modern audience drip fed an endless succession of jump scare laden, soulless pap that pretty much matches their senses. It's much rarer nowadays to get something that aims to get under the skin and psychologically unnerve you and wear you out. So, if nothing else, it's kudos to director Ari Lester, here making his feature length debut, that he has at least attempted to produce something that is unconventional and at least tries to go somewhere new. But, sadly, Hereditary is something that doesn't pull it all off swimmingly. At least, not on the first viewing.It's certainly received loads of really great reviews, from professional film critics and other IMDb users, although there's been a fraction of that who have shared less praise-worthy ones, so it's nice not to feel like you're the one stupid one who 'just didn't get it.' What works about it is really great, as it successfully creates a genuinely unnerving, unsettling atmosphere, with it's drained camera style, and long, lingering camera lenses, that create a desperately solitary effect. Lead star Collette's performance is also amazing, as a woman whose life has been one long storybook of misery, perfectly conveying scenes of horror, grief, anguish and anger, although Byrne as her husband feels a little underdeveloped. The problem is, it all feels cobbled together in a sloppy, messy way, an already unclear and ambiguous story that ends up suffering from pacing issues as a result.Fans of the film Don't Look Now might find appeal in this one, a film where your own imagination's conclusion of events is as accurate as what's actually happened. It has too much going for it not to work, but it's one you may have to watch twice in order to get it and really pick everything up. That's another type of film they don't make so much of these days...***",7,0,1,20 June 2018

Finding Neverland," A very charming story and a fine insight into the creation of one of the most charming stories!!!
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Set in 1903 England,this charts the tale of writer JM Barrie (Johnny Depp) who is suffering a set-back in the shape of some plays opening to some particularly lousy reviews.Then he forms a relationship with the recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet) and her boys.This film charts how Barrie's relationship with the woman and her boys came to cause some consternation and concern among the people of that era,the deterioration of his own marriage and how their relationship blossomed to such a degree it inspired him to write arguably the most endearing children's tale of our time,Peter Pan.This can best be described as another fine Oscar contender.It is by turns endearing and amusing,with fine performances all round.Depp puts in another fine turn and displays some fine versatility as an actor,not to mention delivering a fine Edinburgh accent.The supporting cast,in the shape of Winslet,Dustin Hoffman,the boys and the rest,roll proceedings along splendidly too.The film truly feels alive with the sense of wonder and imagination that inhabited Barrie's heart and mind.The script also delivers on this front,capturing the heart-and-soul of the film as well as the actual story-telling.If the film has any faults,it's that it's too short.All these positive qualities I've mentioned aren't given perhaps as much room to breathe as to really make them take off and fly.But on the whole,it's a thoroughly worthwhile adventure that deserved to win whatever Oscars it did.****",9,3,3,1 May 2005

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThere isn't much of a cast to Training Day.It's mostly just Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke driving around in a car.But in crafting just these main two characters,it has constructed quite probably the best film to come out in the last 18 months,and which deserves to win oscars.It paints an unflinching,uncompromising account of life on the mean streets of LA,rampant with rapists,graffiti,gang members and mostly drug dealers.Hawke is certainly very impressive as the naive rookie cop,but the real star of the show is undoubtedly Washington,who delivers a breath-taking performance as the experienced,hardened police veteran who's just seen too much injustice in his career and has been pushed right over the edge.In between all this fantastic writing,directing and acting,there is also some brilliant action sequences (especially at the end)not to mention a thoroughly emersing hip-hop soundtrack.It really is hard to think of a single fault here,this is simply excellent.Cancel all other arrangements and see it.*****",Null,0,12,2 February 2002
Detroit," Bigelow applies her usual style, and produces probably her best film yet
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning July, 1967. The small town of Detroit in Michigan has erupted in a fireball of chaos and violence. In the middle of all this, a group of young African American musicians are hoping to get their moment in the spotlight and perform to a crowd at a local music venue, only for their show to be cancelled and to be forced home by the police like everyone else. They find themselves holed up in the Algiers hotel, but after a reckless shot is fired from a window, they are all rounded up by Officer Krauss (Will Poulter) and his men, in a bid to ascertain the shooter that leaves three of them dead by the end of the night. It's up to Officer Raymond Dismukes (Will Poulter) to keep the peace and prevent any further loss of life.One of only a handful of female directors in the Hollywood sphere, Kathryn Bigelow has a distinctive style that she's established as her own. Whichever project she's brought to life on the screen, you know it's one of her films you're watching when you're right up close and personal in the action, fully immersed in whatever dramatisation is unravelling on the screen as though you're one of the characters sharing the events. Here, she's shone a spotlight on a particular incident in America's heavily fractured racial history, occurring at the height of the Civil Rights movement and massive social upheaval and change. The tensions of the time elevate the material to an even higher level than it's already managed.It's a depiction of events that occurred fifty years ago, and the half a century mark might have had some impact on Bigelow's decision to bring it to the big screen. But it's a quirky kind of fate that such a historical event is being portrayed at a time where racial divides seem to be springing up again, whether imagined or factual. But unlike the phoney grievances spouted by the likes of the militant, lawless BLM and ANTIFA today, this comes from a time when the AA population really did face massive prejudice and discrimination, and really did have a fight on their hands, and it's to Bigelow's credit that it doesn't feel like she's forcing any leftist narrative down our throats, and lets events unfold as she's interpreted them.Performances wise, as the bad guy, Poulter does look a little too baby faced to be taken entirely seriously in such a serious, commanding role, but that's not to say his delivery is without impact, showcasing a hot headed, bigoted lawman who knows he's got authority and abuses it to out-pour his controlling, bullying nature. The rest of the main cast, made up of a raft of current, trendy black talent, including Boyega and Anthony Mackie, are the cowed, powerless rounded up suspects, with the exception of Boyega, as the level headed lawman who must keep his cool in this tough situation. It's from a different time, one most of us can only imagine, and go by what we've learned. And hopefully, we all have. *****",10,3,9,30 August 2017
In Bruges," Tarantino inspired crime film that scores more hits than misses
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After a hit in London goes wrong, hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) are told to wait in Bruges, a Belgian town, to await a call from Harry (Ralph Fiennes) the crime boss who ordered the hit. Ray was responsible for the hit going wrong, so it's his neck most likely on the line and it doesn't help that while Ken tries to take in the local culture and experience, he sees everything wrong with it. So as they await the call, they must also come to terms with a town where everything seems foreign and weird.Quentin Tarantino's style of crime thriller writing has inspired some notable imitations, one of which would appear to be this well received Europe set film from Martin McDonaugh. Your sense of political correctness can be left well at the door, as jabs at the Chinese, midgets and retards come thick and fast. Other problems though, include it being a rather slow and talky film at times, but it's an undeniably sharp and well written film, which makes it funny and thrilling as well. Performances wise, it's nice to see Farrell back (check out the scene where he talks to the midget and the prostitute, double chin or what???) and there's nice support from Gleeson and Fiennes, ditching his usual well spoken brit thing for a sharp cockney villain dialect. ****",9,1,5,26 April 2008
John Wick," Unremarakble, DVD bargain bin standard action flick
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After the tragic death of his wife, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is given a dog as a parting gift from her, in order that he won't return to his former life of violence and mayhem. However, a run in with gangster's son Iosef (Alfie Allen) results in his home being invaded, and his pet being brutally murdered. This sets the fire raging in John's heart again, and before long, he returns to the streets to enact brutal revenge. However, Iosef's father is Viggo (Michael Nvquist), a Russian mob boss and his former employer.It's remarkable that, while far better actors have descended into a DVD bargain bin hellhole from which there seems no return, Keanu Reeves would still appear to have the star power to headline a Hollywood action film. He could be comfortably settled into that world quite nicely now, but here he is in this fairly well received action film. Quite hard to fathom why, really, when what we have is a fairly standard, join the dots piece of work, with unexciting action scenes that are too sped up and hyper kinetic to make any impact.While Reeves broods, and does the action hero typeset that he's so suited to, singer Lily Allen's brother Alfie appears as the despicable young villain, and the likes of Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo are drafted in as support. Its appeal seemingly lies in its simplicity, with what seems to be a deliberately straightforward, uncomplicated plot that takes you from A to B pretty easily. It does this pretty competently, but rather than be an admirably simple bit of fun, it's just a piecemeal, ineffective affair that washes over you like rain. **",4,4,9,16 March 2016
Rocketman," Dazzling, well acted biography of a modern great
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGrowing up in Pinner, with his emotionally negligent father and domineering mother, young Reginald Dwight showcased a prodigious talent for the piano, which saw him penning his own songs, before adopting the stage name of Elton John (Taron Egerton). From here, he developed a personal and professional partnership with songwriter Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell) and enjoyed phenomenal success but was also plunged into a wild, hedonistic world of celebrity, parties, drink and drugs, as well as a struggle with his own sexuality, that almost threatened to send him over the edge.It's a bit of a risk making a dramatization of the life of a 'living legend', where the slightest deviation from the truth could result in a lawsuit. And so director Dexter Fletcher has taken a brave risk with this musical biopic of one Mr Elton John, which, given he's aware of it and probably seen it, means it must have met with his approval. Which can only mean his life has been every bit as wild and outrageous as Fletcher has portrayed it to be. He's certainly a character who provides interesting subject matter for a biopic, and Rocketman is a slightly disconcerting but still effective and well made production that delivers the goods.Although you might expect it to be a musical (given its subjects profession) it's not made immediately clear, and when the first musical numbers come through, they catch you off guard and unsettle the tone somewhat. They're not expected, given unlike recent musicals such as Jersey Boys and Bohemian Rhapsody, it's not been adapted from a stage musical, plus there's been the 2013 Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra, which featured no musical numbers. Still, on their own, they're electrifying, and when they become more consistent towards the end, they slot into the backdrop of the story, as the film delves into Elton's personal issues and wild excesses.If you can appreciate it in the format it's in, it's wonderful work, with a strong lead performance from Egerton, really capturing the spirit of the flamboyant but troubled John. It manages to include most (but obviously not all!) of his back catalogue, and for the true devotees, will serve the same function as the Broadway stage musical it obviously wants to be. ****",9,17,31,3 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Thorough, affecting remake with a shattering ending
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningSinger Ally (Lady Gaga) struggles to get by in life, working behind the scenes in a restaurant. But she gets a lucky break one night when famous country singer Jack (Bradley Cooper) and his entourage roll by a bar she's drinking in, and the pair hit it off. Forming a relationship, Ally is supported in chasing her dream as a recording artist by Jack, and becomes a star in her own right. But Jack is plagued by demons, struggling with a drink problem that plunges them both into a tumultuous journey of love and despair.There was, it would seem, a love drama from the late 70s/early 80s entitled A Star is Born, which established star Bradley Cooper has decided to remake as his acting/directing debut. While he felt confident enough to do this as an actor, we have co star Lady Gaga, apparently feeling confident enough to make her acting debut, but conversely, in a film about singing, having more experience of this than Cooper, who's playing a country singer. So we have a film with two diametrically opposed co stars trying something new. The result is a surprisingly affecting, thoroughly examined tale that will leave an impression for a while.Cooper leaves no stone unturned fleshing out the development and subsequent dynamics of the relationship between the main antagonists, and, despite their considerable age difference, manages to create a convincing couple. They say behind every strong (or apparently strong) man is a strong woman, and the film is a testament to that, with Cooper as the crumbling, destructive guy, raging with inner turmoil with demons from his past, and Gaga, effective in her debut performance, as the girl who is more attracted to his faults than his virtues, desperate to save him and save him from falling down. It's an affecting tale, thoroughly examined in minute detail by Cooper in his debut directorial project.There's a little bit too much of the f word (how true that is to real life characters like this, I don't know) and it doesn't always sail a totally steady course, but it's still a highly worthwhile drama, with an earth shattering, gut wrenchingly unexpected ending that leaves you with a solid emotional punch. ****",9,0,1,8 January 2020
Gravity," Novel approach to the 'stranded in space' genre, unlike anything you've seen before
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRyan (Sandra Bullock) and Matt (George Clooney) are two astronauts, working on a space station, whilst trying to juggle their respective emotional baggage. All is going smoothly, only for a big disaster to strike and the pair finding themselves desperately trying to get to safety. When Ryan finds herself stranded on her own, as the less experienced explorer, she must use all her wits in a desperate struggle for survival.Alfonso Cuaron's short, critically acclaimed space drama plunges us straight in to the action from the start, slowing closing in on our two main characters, who we are forced to make a connection with on the basis of some piecemeal small talk as they go about their business, with the famous performers playing them relying on their assured, seasoned on screen personas that they've each developed over many years, with Clooney's smooth talking, wise cracking man's man approach, coupled with Bullock's hard ass, cynical girl in a man's world thing. Shortly after we feel all settled in, the realization slowly dawns on the characters and the audience that something's wrong, and the tension sets in, and we feel as though we are in with these people as they are forced to rely on their instinctive human ingenuity to survive.Interjected between the various seat edge moments, our heroes are left merely to wonder aimlessly, but as they do, they (and we) are witness to some truly breath taking cinematography, of the vast spacial glacier and the outstanding, grand space station, leaving the wow factor on more than one level. At some point, Bullock becomes stranded from her companion, and forced to survive on her own, as the tension and the stakes start to rise that little bit higher. Somehow, in the space of under an hour and a half, you are left feeling as though your senses have been taken on a visceral, mind bending ride, where by the end it's become genuinely nerve wracking as to whether she'll survive, even though inside we're pretty sure.Alfonso Cuaron has crafted an original, novel picture, that takes a well trodden format but delivers it in a way that you really haven't seen before. Clooney and Bullock are an effective double act, even when they're not actually on screen together, and it deserved to win the awards and get the acclaim it did. *****",10,2,5,28 May 2014

The following is a true depiction of his battle for survival and the unexpected kindness and humanity he was shown by some local Afghan villagers.The backdrop of the controversial Afghan war would no doubt provide many a setting for some really meaty tales that could be converted in to a Hollywood film, and here we have one by Peter Berg, adapted from the true life story of Marcus Luttrell and his harrowing five day long battle for survival in the Afghan wilderness, where he saw his comrades brutally killed off one by one and was forced to endure his own terrible ordeal, before re-discovering the humanity of others after being rescued by some local villagers. Berg has crafted a film that manages to open in a really involving, absorbing style that is more than you expect, but which loses it somehow after the battle starts, descending in to a stylish but less moving effort. Somehow, the early scenes give it a depth and development it loses when the action starts.Somehow, more than in any film I've seen him in before, here Wahlberg's limitations as an actor really shine through, even though I can't say he gave an especially bad performance, or any worse than usual. It could be because he takes up much of the screen time on his own, and can't rely on a supporting cast including the likes of Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster and Eric Bana to carry him. It's surprising what a lead star can reveal when their safety net goes. The film seems split in to three parts, before, during and after the battle, and even after during his humanistic scenes with the villagers, it doesn't switch on.From the director who gave us the likes of Battleship, this could have been a lot worse, but a more charismatic lead and not letting up on the stirring human dynamics at any point would have still made the experience an even more dramatic depiction of a real life thriller. ***",7,0,2,17 May 2014
Wind River," Sadly undelivering thriller which fails to make the most of its potential
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA young woman is found dead in a snowy enclave in a Native American reservation. Completely isolated and cut off from the outside world, it falls to embittered local game tracker Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) and FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) to get to the bottom of the case. However, as professional tensions between the locals and the national agents, as well as the wall of silence that seems to build around the residents, intensifies, it proves to be more difficult than a standard hunt.A good several years after his feature length 2011 debut, Taylor Sheridan returns to the helm with this moody, atmospheric thriller, based around true events. Diving into the heart of the reclusive, insular Native American reservations, we enter a snow-covered, out of bounds netherworld, that in itself sets the scene for an effective backdrop on which to set a brooding, suspenseful thriller. What we end up with is a film that plays doggedly to conventions, although unfortunately in a fairly generic, standard way, that squanders its chance to make the most of its potential.Truth quite often tends to make for more compelling filmmaking than fiction, and so WR had even more chance to make the most of what it promised. Sadly, it just plays out like a connect the dots affair, obeying all the genre conventions despite having more opportunity than most to delve beyond these. It has the look and feel of your average TV movie, despite its A list Hollywood stars, and to about that level of quality. Somehow, no genuine air of suspense or tension is created in regards finding out what caused the dead girl's fate, and so the core of the film is unfortunately rotted.Performances wise, lead stars Renner and Olsen suit their roles, and fit into their skin better than any other performers who spring to mind. It's just a shame they didn't have more satisfying material to work with. **",4,3,7,25 February 2018

Star Trek," A dream come true for big fans, but will satisfy none fans just as well
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Not being an obsessive fan of the original series/films, I can't go into a massive rant about how faithful/unfaithful this new film has been to Gene Roddenberry's original vision. The whole point of it in the first place was to revamp and relaunch it for a new generation (many of whom, of course, weren't even around when it first came out.) And so director JJ Abrams has given us his new vision of the series, and actually appears to have both kept the spirit and tone of the original series alive, whilst also giving the first film in the new series an edginess and vitality that may have been lacking first time around.The considerable length is matched out by a lively cast list to match the institution the original stamped. Each of the new actors brings their new roles to life with that bit more edge, from Chris Pine's wise cracking, smart arsey but fearless Kirk, to Zachary Quinto's brilliantly nerdish, unfeeling Spock (with Leonard Nimoy popping up as him in the future!) Likewise, supporting players Bruce Greenwood, as kidnapped Commander Pike and Eric Bana as the villainous Romulan Nero, give added gusto in their respective intrepid good guy/ruthless bad guy roles. Plus there's Ben Cross, instantly recognizable as Spock's dad and Simon Pegg clearly having a great time as a less chubby Scott. Winona Ryder was also in it, but I must say I didn't recognize her...The opening takes it's time to grow on you, with not the most interesting dialogue or snazzy writing (which doesn't improve much further into it, really), but stick with it and as the film's considerable length waves on, it will slowly absorb you, drawing you more into the story as it goes on, with, as expected, some fantastic special effects and costume design. Should just about appeal to 'trekkies' and non trekkies alike. ****",9,1,12,7 July 2009
Fury," Visceral and unflinching, but without any real solid structure
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1945, as the Second World War draws to a close, Hitler has ordered a final, all out assault from every member of the Aryan race to ensure a clearly unattainable victory. In this culminating desperation, Tank commander Captain Collier (Brad Pitt) leads his squadron of men, only now they have a new recruit, in the shape of Private Ellison (Logan Lerman), who's got a whole lot of learning to do in the brutal realities of war.The Nazi Supermen may not have lasted for a thousand years, as Hitler wanted, but yarns from the battlefields of World War 2 could quite conceivably do so, and Fury is the latest in a long line of such stories. David Ayer's addition to the genre thrusts us in to that period towards the end, when desperation to secure victory was pumping from both the sides of good and evil, more so evil, and as such their panic was leading to ever more extreme and twisted methods to win. As such, like the best war films, Fury does not shy away from showing the brutal, horrific reality of life in battle, unflinching in both blood-letting and human drama. Sadly, Ayer just bumbles the whole thing around, without any solid narrative or structure to hold it together.The humorous touch from more recent films like The Monuments Men and Inglorious Basterds is not present, and the film is aiming to come off in the league of such fare as Saving Private Ryan and the lesser heard of, but raved about A Midnight Clear. But while those films did a marvellous job of bringing real characters to life, with deft, subtle touches that exposed their human frailties in the most real way, Fury's characters can't help but project the stereotypical blandness of your average war film. Pitt is an effective leading man, and he does his best here, but he doesn't quite have the charisma to really make it great. Likewise, the supporting cast are also unable to rise to their best.It's a shame, as with tighter writing and a more structured plot, Fury could have risen from the good to great category. I didn't think it was quite as bad as a lot of other people seem to, but that's not to say I can't see the missed potential. ***",7,1,5,28 July 2015
Fight Club," The best film I have seen in ages
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThis is my second attempt to get my review of this,one of my favourite films in ages,across,and,having purchased a copy today,I once again absorbed what a tremendously defiant piece of modern urban literature this is.Fight Club scoops up the sad,soulless air of generation surrounding us in the nineties better than any other modern artie film around.Not a scene really goes by when the entertainingly bleak,unashamedly honest depiction of any modern society's ceaseless decline into mediocrity is'nt captured.Psyical,hand-to-hand violence is really the main sort of violence that's destroying what I can see of society today.Yet,as the twist towards the end unravels,we responsibly learn that we all deep in our hearts probably think and feel like Tyler Durden does,but that if we really exacted that kind of revenge upon society,it would really get totally worse,and we should count our blessings for at least the safe world we live in.Sort of a quiet warning to many of the audience members who feel like Edward Norton's character Jack does.But,on the other hand,another lesson of this film is that you should never think you're any better than anyone else no matter what.Someone with a degree in social science may more than likely have a better payed,more renowned job title than someone who collects litter,but no matter what,they're both still people,with the same feelings,and the same acknowledgement to pain.Really,films like Fight Club can make a difference in more ways than one ,depending on which way you interpret them.Imperfections and the rat race may decline if films like this are taken as seriously as they can be,but some idiots in the audience will obviously be as inclined as ever to think that physical,and other violence is the answer to everything,and observational literature like this will of course go completely to miss.Meat Loaf fares his best ever post-singing performance in this,as Jack's slightly dumb,impressionable friend,although as he's not the main star of the show,he does,as ever,get very limited screen time.By the end,virtually all the members have become and accepted their posistions as soulless,plodding drones,who're happier to be like that with this cult than they would be with any thing society has to offer them.But the exceptionally good film it is,remember Fight Club is only a movie at the end of the day.Soon,hollywood will make others,spend ages making you wait anticipating the completion of it's production,make you wait further for their release date,promote it until you can't get it out of your face,then you'll see it,they'll take your money,you might think it was all a waste of time,they or the cinema manager's don't care,then the process will repeat itself,again,and again,and again,etc.etc.etc............*****",Null,1,4,21 July 2000
Darkest Hour," Taut, intelligent drama that doesn't get recognition so much these days
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn May 1940, Hitler has invaded Checkozlovakia and most of the eastern bloc, while Allied troops are at his mercy in France. Current Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain (Ronald Pickup) has suffered a vote of no confidence due to his appeasement stance, and so the current government look for someone to take his place. Cue the eccentric, highly strung Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman), whose approach to governance is as unconventional as his lifestyle, sending the establishment into a flurry. As France and other European nations seek to surrender, Churchill flies in the face of popular opinion and vows to fight them till the end.In British folklore, it's hard to imagine a figure more revered for courage and 'bulldog spirit' than Winston Churchill, and yet there's been hardly any attempts to create a dramatization of his life, and how he sculpted his place in history. With Darkest Hour, director Joe Wright has attempted to do this, taking an all star cast and placing the burden on their shoulders to do justice to the great man and his exploits. And the result is a film that even the most drama dodging film goer would struggle to move away from, a testament in itself to the grand job he's done.It may be depicting one of the most dramatic moments in the history of the world, yet despite this, the film itself is pretty much an endless barrage of talking, with hardly any action at all. And so, Wright has an extra hard job of making it enthralling and taut, and it's a credit to him that the writing, dialogue and delivery do keep you on the edge of your seat as they do. Despite a marvellous supporting cast, including Kristen Scott Thomas and Ben Mendolsohn as the King, it is of course lead star Gary Oldman who makes it as exciting as it is. He injects his portrayal of Churchill with that wild, crazy energy you remember from earlier performances in grittier films, such as Leon and The Firm.For the most part, it stays on track and plays out in a realistic, true to life manner, with the possible exception of Winston taking a detour and going on a train (when the standard 'diversity' moment is shoved in our faces.) But whether it's exploding in theatrics or staying grounded in reality, it's still brilliant, seat edge filmmaking of the type you don't get so much of these days. ****",9,0,3,4 March 2018
Monster," A bit disappointing,actually
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThe true life story of serial killer Aileen Wournos (Charlize Theron),a butt-ugly highway prostitute who was executed in 2002 after 12 years on death row for the murder of some of her clients after one tried to rape her (must have been desperate!)There's a sub-plot involving her lesbian relationship with a painfully shy girl with a religious upbringing named Selby (Christina Ricci).(These two would be better suited as lesbians as not many men would find them attractive.)This was a film that I was looking forward to seeing with a huge amount of anticipation.The plot line,based on a true story,sounded very interesting,and everyone had raved about how good the performances were,in particular,Charlize Theron in the lead.And that is perhaps why I considered Monster to be such a let down as a film,as I always do when my expectations are very high.The film basically just failed to involve me in any way,performances or story wise.On the performances front,there were occasional flourishes here-and-there,but generally speaking it was all very under-whelming.And as for the story,there is a disappointing shortage of emotional depth invested in it.We just basically see Aileen in the state she was in in adulthood,and don't learn enough about the abuse and abandonment she endured through her life up until that point.There is a fairly effective snippet somewhere at the beginning,but it's just not enough to engage in the film the whole way through.Okay,maybe it was actually a brilliant film,but it was recorded in such a low volume audio sound that I could only hear the lead stars mumbling out everything and I was unable to hear large chunks of dialogue that the actors were speaking,and so I was unable to take it all in.The only segment in which the film breaks free from this curse is in the soundtrack,which is very impressive and certainly very alive,loud and vibrant.The film is certainly a lot more low-budget and independent looking than I imagined,especially for one that went on to win an Oscar or two,not to mention shorter.A short,effective and to-the-point film is nothing for me to put down,but here it just feels as though the makers tried to cram too much in to such a small space of time and didn't give their project enough time to flourish and grow.As I said,it's commendable in the soundtrack department and occasional high points throughout the film.And the make-up stylist did a very impressive job turning the stunningly attractive Theron into someone as unsightly as Aileen.But,considering what could have been,when that's the best there is,it really isn't saying much.A let down.**",Null,0,1,12 August 2004
Memento," Stunning,easily one of the year's best
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThis film goes to show it is'nt just the Coen brothers who make this sort of thing work beautifully.Guy Pearce,who's work I hav'nt seen since his brilliant turn in L.A. Confidential,excels further here in quite possibly the most intelligent,compelling,and twist filled movie of the year.Nothing is certain in the film,it is all told in such a complex and original way that at no point is it predictable or tiresome.Pierce plays a former insurance investigator who due to severe brain damage on the intervention of his wife's murder,is completely unable to piece together events that may have occured much longer than an hour before what he is currently thinking.He relates the current state that is ruining his life to that of a man who's claims he was once called to investigate,who was mucked about by the company on the grounds that his claim was mental,not psyical.The movie transcends between a telephone conversation he is having in a motel room,and long,stretched out events that are to happen later on as the plot thickens.The movie is so clever and original,and only those who like exterior thrills will really complain about the amount of talking in the movie.For those who like to use their brains to piece events together,this is easily the best film of it's kind since JFK.Another asset this film has is a haunting soundtrack which plays eeringly throughout the film,adding stridend touches to a film already reveling in puzzling scenarios and tense revalations.This film is truly unique,and,it goes to show once again,sadly,that films like this are always only going to get limited releases in selected cinemas,while big budget,money making eye candy will continue to play us all for mugs.Expand your horizons people,films that tax you like this will always pay off in satisfaction more at the end.*****",Null,2,4,15 November 2000
Inglourious Basterds," Misfiring, self indulgent latest addition to the Tarantino staple
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning During the second world war, in Nazi occupied France, a young girl witnesses the execution of her family at the hands of Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), barely escaping herself. Years later, that young girl has grown into Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) a cinema owner who has big plans for revenge at a big premiere that the German army will be attending. Meanwhile, similar plans for retribution are in mind for a group of Jewish-American soldiers calling themselves 'The Basterds', lead by tough nut hill billy Aldo Reine (Brad Pitt) who plan to leave their mark on the monsters by killing them- and taking their scalps as trophies.Despite being one of the most recognised and influential writer/directors of our time, Quentin Tarantino is one of the most selective men in the business, dishing out new material once every blue moon. His latest work, a loose remake of an old war film with the same name, revolves around one of the biggest themes that his films are known for- revenge. Violent, bloody revenge, to be more precise. It's lacking the fun, vibrant edge of the Kill Bill films and for all it's brutality, does display a more mature, rounded edge than most of his work. This is a blessing and a curse, though, because Inglorious Basterds is simply no fun at all. In fact, it's deadly boring. The kiss arse film magazines and aficianardos have fallen over themselves with praise as usual, trying to make everyone feel it's another absolute work of genius and that Tarantino can do no wrong, but to a wider demographic of the audience, the film will just come over as pretentious and wholly self indulgent, thinking it's so clever but really just too big for it's boots. Most of the dialogue is over the top and completely unbelievable and the film pretentiously plays in different 'chapters', like it's some deep, meaningful piece of art and not just the usual Tarantino blood fest. Performances wise, Pitt carries the lead role well, not leaving a huge mark or creating a truly memorable character, but doing the best he can and to be fair, the supporting cast, including Laurent, Waltz, Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender and Diane Kruger, are all on top form too but the material weighs them down.Those not screaming about the genius writing and directing will, as usual, be complaining about the violence, but despite some nasty scenes, it's hard to see it as a film that in any way really glorifies violence or stylises it, as some of Tarantino's past films arguably have. All the same, though, it's a slow, uppity mess of a film that is so far up itself it loses touch with what made it's directors films so great in the first place. **",4,6,11,5 May 2010

With the first film entering its fortieth year this year, the SW saga provides a service to the art of motion pictures like no other, a thunderous, colourful assault on the senses that will always be suited to the big screen and understandably has an enduring fan base. Now another big screen instalment takes the story back before the start, for fans of the series obviously, with unsatisfying results.An all star cast comprised of hot young talent and older, experienced hands have all ploughed into this venture, but the result is something with big ambitions, but no sense of direction or genuine engagement with the audience. Director Gareth Edwards, getting a name for making big screen ventures of established franchises, simply doesn't have a strong enough plot to guide this effort, nor the material to create character development that makes you care about the characters. As a result, none of the cast turn in performances that could be considered their best, and you may struggle to stay awake during the none spectacular bits.Visually, it's as amazing as ever, a swooping, swirling adventure that could beat any theme park ride, even if some of it feels a little 70s esque.

World War Z," Flat, unexciting latest addition to the zombie staple
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is a retired UN worker who has taken his family out on an ordinary, everyday trip, only, for, well, zombies to suddenly start running around out of nowhere and killing everybody. Being the hero of a Hollywood movie, naturally he gets himself and his family to safety, and gets in touch with his old muckers at the UN to find out what's going on, and they end up taking him away from his family to lead a trek over to Israel to discover the source of the mayhem, and look for a cure to stop it before it's too late.Shot in a new, almost experimental digitally altered lens, World War Z is the latest film to re-hash the 'zombie' genre, already explored by the likes of I Am Legend and Dawn of the Dead, not to mention Brit entries like 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later. So originality isn't the name of the game here (when is it in Hollywood these days?) and with the bar set so low, you'd expect this knock off of other films before it to at least try and take the genre in a different direction. But World War Z simply explodes in to the action within the first few minutes, without any sort of attempt at character development, meaning we could simply care less about the fate of these characters, which makes the ensuing ride all the more tedious.Impressive zombie effects can't hide a banal, boring script that's lost your attention within the first few minutes. As such, lead star Pitt blandly goes through the motions, at the hands of slovenly direction from Marc Forster. Sometimes these types of films can try and have some kind of hidden social message to them or deeper significance, but it's hard to pick up anything here. Despite being the type of film it would probably have been better to have seen there, this failed to draw me to the cinema to see it, and I left it to DVD, where it's minimal impact is felt even less.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Faintly passable but nowhere near as much fun as the original
","STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are about to celebrate their wedding day- when suddenly they are arrested for aiding in the escape of pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp.) Now facing the death penalty themselves, Will is bargained a pardon- if he can locate a map that will show the key to unlocking a pirates wet dream of treasure for the East India Trading Company. With no choice but to agree he sets off to find Jack and locate the gold- but Jack's got problems of his own, namely an unpaid debt to feared pirate Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) that will see him cursed to eternal damnation in hell if it is not settled.Following the massive success of the original POTC in 2003, the sequel was just screaming out to be seen. But, riding arrogantly high on the commercial and critical success of the last film, this time round it appears the original film's director, Gore Verbinski, has got carried away with himself and made a very self indulgent sequel. Overlong, messy and convoluted, Dead Man's Chest simply doesn't sail the shaky tides as well as it's predecessor, creating an uneven and unfocused film that fails to sustain an interest during it's lengthy running time. I don't think I fell asleep at any point, but there was a period where it was as if I simply switched off and a large segment of the film just got blanked out in my mind.The cast are back on (mostly) good form. Johnny Depp once again crafts a very engaging and enthralling character in Jack Sparrow, a wise-cracking, charismatic rogue in everyone's bad books and Keira Knightley also returns as the heroine Elizabeth Swann, strikingly beautiful and very agreeable in the role. In the main cast, only Bloom fails to strike a chord, rather wooden and bland as the main hero. The film boasts quite an impressive supporting cast in general, from Nighy to Mackenzie Crook and Johnathon Pryce (wasted) as Elizabeth's father. But there's a weird sub-plot of them all double-crossing each other and doing anything to come out on top, as opposed to the last film where they all shared a jolly, merry camaraderie together. The film ends leaving the room open perfectly for the next film in the series but in doing so fails to provide a satisfactory ending to an already piecemeal and lacklustre story.In between everything, the special effects and action sequences have quite a neat flare to them and the script madly races along trying to keep everything above water. But where the first film set sail with a mighty roar, the first sequel seems to get lost at the Bermuda Triangle. **",5,3,6,14 August 2006
Argo," Slick, stylish caper from the increasingly quality Affleck staple
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1979, after a deposed leader is refused to be returned home to Iran to face trial for human rights abuses, an army of militants storm the Canadian Embassy in that country and take everyone inside hostage, save for a few who escape and hide out at the Canadian ambassador's residence. They desperately need to be rescued, and so the CIA turns to specialist Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) to hatch a plan to get them out. Naturally, he comes up with the most insane idea imaginable- to disguise them as a film crew scouting for locations for a new science fiction fantasy called Argo. It was so crazy-it worked.It seems some of the best stories are real life ones that are so outlandish and far fetched they could be believed to be fiction. Clint Eastwood showed us as such with Changeling and now another former actor who proved to be a much better director, in the shape of Ben Affleck, showcases this dramatization of the real life rescue of a few escapees in a hostile climate. The big ask here is: can you make a story you already know the outcome of genuinely thrilling? And the simple answer is: yes. As the film draws to a close and the group are racing against the clock to make it through the airport and onto the plane, it is genuinely a nail biting, seat edge experience, that can only be down to impressive writing and a smooth, even pace. His third film at the helm, this certainly feels like the most dynamic and ambitious of Affleck's projects, and while it's historical accuracy and attention to detail could be called in to question, it undeniably brings a colourful and vibrant chapter in American history in to the light.The most notable thing, actually, is the smooth, balanced transition between the tense drama and the more light hearted, easy going feel, where the character's turn the film's title into a rude but imaginative play on words over and over, which, along with the general zaniness of the idea, makes the whole thing that little bit more of an involving, enthralling ride. ****",9,1,2,14 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Immensely enjoyable summer blockbuster
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn a summer movie season filled to the brim with adaptations of ancient franchises,Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl is a breath of fresh air in more ways than one.For not only is it an adventurous diversion,but a thoroughly engaging,rip roaring action adventure.Besides being that,there is a great performance to enjoy from Johnny Depp,who does a marvellous cockney accent and has a gluing presence throughout the film.The supporting cast,in the shape of Orlando Bloom,Geoffrey Rush and the beautiful Kiera Knightley (as the main hero,villain and romantic interest respectively) are fine as well but he is truly the star of the show.There is some fine dialogue to enjoy as well and,despite the movie's considerable length,it moves by so briskly you wouldn't notice it.Highly recommended.****",Null,1,5,5 November 2003
Star Trek Into Darkness," Long awaited follow up film that keeps the series floating for a new generation
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter a perilous mission on the planet Niburu, where Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) is reckless in saving the life of Spock (Zachary Quinto), the two once again find themselves at odds when Spock reveals some truths about Kirk's fabrications. But they find themselves thrust back together again when embittered ex Starfleet officer Khan (Benedict Cumberbatch) launches a one man reign of terror.Despite following the current trend of resurrecting an old franchise and making it in to a marketable new series, J.J. Abrams has spaced out (no pun intended) his follow up to his 2009 re-generation of the series, preferring to keep the fans in suspense following that film's critical and commercial success. And he proves that taking one's time and not being too quick to make a quick buck on the back of a winning horse works wonders with this solid, satisfying second instalment that should prove worthwhile to mega fans and more casual trekkers alike.Abrams takes a no dawdling approach, starting as he means to go on with a thrilling chase sequence on the planet Niburu, with Kirk and an associate finding themselves being chased by some scary inhabitants with white, bold heads. From here on in, he maintains a steady pace, never letting things drag on for too long until the next action spectacular. The tone never gets too heavy or serious either, with tongue firmly in cheek most of the time. The 'Into Darkness' suffix feels misplaced, given the film's more light hearted feel compared to the original's dark, brooding style. That's not to say darker, more serious subject matter is not explored, as the film is another modern blockbuster that isn't afraid to tap in to current affairs that have everyone on edge, such as terrorist attacks and concealed intelligence. The film respects the audience's intelligence and expects it to do the same.Performances wise, Pine and Quinto ane still a cracking mismatched buddy buddy act, Pine an eager Martin Riggs to Quinto's Roger Murtaugh, while a support cast including Simon Pegg, Alice Eve and Robocop himself Peter Weller add class. But the stand out personality is Cumberbatch as the villain, effortlessly owning his screen time and chewing the scenery with his dark, foreboding presence as the villain. To top things off, Abrams lets another Brit boy have a crack at the big time, with Noel Clarke in a supporting (but still very noticeable) role as an ill fated man.Abrams has figured out how to make this old franchise appeal to a modern audience, and ensures the length is never a drag and the action never lets up. ****",9,6,12,1 June 2013
Hostel," Has pretensions to be one of the nastiest movies ever seen but for me it was just one of the most boring
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A couple of obnoxious young Americans and a pal they met on their journey take a trip to Amsterdam, Holland to enjoy a no holds barred holiday of casual sex and pot smoking. However, things take an unexpected turn when members of their number start mysteriously disappearing. It turns out there is another pleasure the boys haven't sampled- a pleasure where they'll suffer the most extreme pain and torture they've ever known from which they may well not leave alive.Touted as one of the most gruesome films ever made, Hostel proudly boasted a blood-splattered publicity campaign with a grisly promotional poster and that master of all things violent Quentin Tarantino billed as the executive producer. I've already seen some extremely nasty films this year, in the shape of Running Scared and The Devil's Rejects. Although Hostel is not as consistently nasty as those films there are a handful of scenes that definitely won't work wonders for the faint-hearted. But for the most part this just struck me as one of the most boring films I've seen in quite a while.If you still feel the need to slow down and peer in the car wreck yourself, you'll have to let yourself in for an unbelievably boring first half where absolutely nothing seems to happen, some unlikeable central characters and, of course, the unpleasant blood-splattered scenes. It might help if you try to see it as an examination of the dark side that could result in Amsterdam's culture of indulgence, but if you tune in for shock value, if you're like me, you'll most likely just end up falling asleep. **",3,8,15,18 April 2006
Green Room," Dire confined settings horror film
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A group of aspiring grunge singers unwittingly accept a gig at an event where a Neo-Nazi element is likely to be present. They soldier through it, and make it out in one piece, until they stumble on a murder and find themselves held against their will while the perpetrators figure out what to do. A battle for survival ensues, while the group await the arrival of Darcy (Patrick Stewart), their chief in command.It's still a very effective formula in horror films to have characters who start off in fairly controlled situations where something happens, and events spiral out of control, leaving them in a terrifying predicament that they never even dreamed of. And from this angle, Green Room had as much potential as any other, but Jeremy Saulnier's deathly drained piece is sadly an uninvolving, totally unsuspenseful thriller that you will struggle with to the end.It's as if the cast can sense how bad the screenplay and dialogue are, and most of it is barely audible, with all of them mumbling everything at a really low murmur, where you almost can't hear a word. This is complimented by an overly drained camera lens that adds nothing to the atmosphere. Performances wise, the late Anton Yelchin fails to stand out any more than any of the other charisma free young cast, and you know things must be bad when even the accomplished Stewart turns in a terrible performance, doing an unconvincing American accent.Not so much the Green Room, this one should have just been left on the Cutting Room floor. *",2,9,21,22 March 2017
Public Enemies," Sweeping but undelivering gangster epic
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1930s America, John Dillenger (Johnny Depp) and his cohorts were the talk of America, with their series of audacious bank robberies and the canny skill involved taking the news by storm. So to take down a ruthless criminal, was needed an even more ruthless Federal Agent, in the shape of Purvis (Christian Bale) who lead a team of men who left no stone unturned in their increasingly desperate battle against their adversaries.Crime movie enthusiast Michael Mann has brought a real life criminal to life in this stirring biopic and found lead star Depp a role he is well suited for. Aside from his usual trademark touches, he's notably used a different style of camera lens and scope to film this in, giving it a more cutting edge, modern day feel. In the end, though, it all comes down to whether his approach works and on this occasion, sadly it hasn't.The film feels empty, with a lot of scope and vision, but precious little to offer in the way of genuine depth and character. There's lots going on, all of it flashy and stylish, but somehow it all stays completely uninvolving. Which is wrong, considering all the talent involved. Depp is competent as ever in the lead role, bringing the right mood and style to Dillenger, while Bale also leaves no stone unturned as his adversary, taking us into a nose dive world of 30s law enforcement in a time before things like the Miranda Rights, where suspects and informants are beaten and made to suffer real psychological torture. And what a supporting cast, with the likes of Marienne Coultiarrd as Dillenger's lover, Stephen Dorff, Channing Tatum, Billy Crudup, Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Lang and from the Brit talent pack, Stephen Graham doing a fine New York accent as Dillenger's sidekick Baby Face Nelson. None of it really works, though, a big dreamer of a film that aimed for greatness but punched well below it's weight. **",4,0,0,27 April 2010
The Babadook," Impressive, low budget Aussie offering that restores your faith in horror
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Morning *** Friday Night ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Amelia (Essie Davis) was widowed when her husband was driving her to hospital to give birth to their son Samuel (Noah Wiseman.) Since then, she has been struggling to raise Samuel alone, while he has been displaying some wild behaviour. Things take a sinister turn, however, when they discover a creepy looking book entitled The Babadook, and Samuel begins seeing an imaginary monster that drives him completely out of control. As Amelia is confronted with spooky happenings of her own, she finds herself pushed over the edge, on the verge of losing her own sanity.Being Halloween week, it's been the perfect opportunity for me to get round to watching this well received, off the wayside horror offering that seems to have hailed from Australia. Marking Jennifer Kent's feature length directing debut, after a string of TV work and short films, this takes the familiar horror device of placing a child in the centre of the story and adds in more distinctive themes of unresolved grief and emotional dependency, and works them wonderfully, with only a fraction of the budget of your modern day, sanitised American horror film.It lays its cards on the table very early on, taking a slow, lingering opening that generates its terror from a haunting use of atmosphere and silence. The set up created from the mother-and-son relationship generates an interesting dynamic all of its own, working in a way where you're never sure how it's going to work in relation to the unfolding story. Without any great special effects or CGI, Kent has crafted something that truly works and restores your faith in modern horror.By the end, it's lost its original angle a little, and it's hard not to notice shades of The Shining and Poltergeist that have crept in to the script, but none of that detracts from what has gone before, a splendid offering that generally works and restores your faith in horror. ****",9,2,4,1 November 2015
Us," Perfectly watchable, just pales in comparison to what it's up against
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs a young girl, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o) visited the beach, and took a detour into a hall of mirrors, only to find herself faced by a creepy doppelganger of herself, an incident that scarred her through her childhood. Years later, she's married to Gabe (Winston Duke) and has two children of her own, Zora (Shahadi Wright) and Jason (Evan Alex.) To destress from their heavy lives, the family take a trip back to that same beach, only for Jason to head to the same place that Adelaide did as a kid. After that, they find themselves accosted by a group of doppelgangers of themselves, who have plans of their own.I was a latecomer to Get Out, director Jordan Peele's directorial horror debut, and dodged all the hype surrounding it when it was first released, but was certainly very impressed with it when I did get round to seeing it. And so, on learning of the existence of Us, his follow up effort, I felt somewhat more compelled to go out and check it out, even though from the offset it was living in the shadow of GO. It's received mostly quite positive reviews, and it's certainly worth seeing, it just struggles to live up to the quality of what went before it.Revelling in the current diversity agenda sweeping Hollywood, Peele helms an entirely black lead cast, in a film deriving much of it's humour from subtle references to African American culture. The main concept is certainly intriguing, and creates a decent air of mystery to what could be behind it all. It's also strongly acted by the lead stars. But it lacks the surreal inventiveness of GO, simply revolving around a concept without having much deeper beneath the surface. While the mystery is suitably resolved at the end, it just comes off as far fetched and outlandish, not helped by moving from the containment of the family's predicament, onto a worldwide epidemic.In a modern horror climate dominated by CGI, cheap jump scares and shaky cameras, it's great to have a director like Peele around, who keeps things story centred and at least attempts to give his work a cerebral edge. Us in no way represents a downward spiral, it just can't quite match the standard Peele previously set. ***",7,4,9,24 March 2019
Ted," High concept comedy that's already gaining the cult following it was meant to
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs a young boy with no friends, John (Mark Whalberg) wished his teddy bear would come to life, and was over-joyed when he did. However, as he's grown up, the bear has stayed alive and grown up with him, turning in to a drug smoking, foul mouthed, lecherous creation who still serves as his best buddy. However, John's girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) thinks it's time he moved out, forcing John to make a tough decision. Meanwhile, the creepy Donny (Giovanni Ribisi) and his even creepier son lurk in the background, harboring a disturbing obsession with Ted.Nothing inspires comedy like absurdity, and the wackiest, most far out ideas are usually the ones that take longer to get your head around, but usually produce the best results, simply because of how, well, insane and far fetched they are. So in many ways, Seth MacFarlene (whose hugely successful Family Guy is just something I never got in to, a la Futurama) had a certified cat in the bag when he hit on the idea of Ted, which opens with a whimsical childhood fantasy coming true plot line in the vein of the 80's Tom Hanks vehicle, Big, but which opens out in to a far more adult oriented, risqué comedy vehicle that seems hell bent on pushing boundaries of taste and decency as far as they can go.In the lead role, Whalberg's a generally intense actor, better suited to more dramatic, tough roles, but that's not to say comedy is out of his ability, and he's perfectly convincing as a thirty plus slacker who's grown older and irresponsible with his, er, friend. MaFarlene serves as voice duties on the titular not so cuddly bear, and gets to further inject his already filthy story with his own cutting style. Meanwhile, Ribisi is a genuinely creepy villain who could actually have made this role work in a less light hearted film.Sharp, cynical, leaving no stone of taste or decency unturned and leaving no popular culture reference unlampooned, Ted is one of the more ridiculous, unbelievable ideas for a film in recent times, but one which has obviously produced the expected results. I've taken my time getting to review it, but at least I know I'm in the agreeing team with it. ****",9,1,6,9 June 2013

The Irishman," Scorsese's most ambitious project, if not quite a masterpiece
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Morning * Monday MorningIn 1950s America, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) is trying to get by, providing for his family as a delivery driver. However, when a containment of meat goes missing from one of his deliveries, he is hauled before the court on suspicion of stealing. A union lawyer gets him off, and Jimmy is taken to meet Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci), head of the Bufalino crime family, who control the unions. Bufalino has heard of his service record in Italy, and thinks Frank has what it takes to be a great hitman, which he takes to like a duck to water. When he is introduced to union supremo Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), it is the beginning of a deadly alliance throughout the years, of murder, corruption and betrayal.The Irishman may be the most eagerly anticipated film of the year, Martin Scorsese's mammoth reunion of himself, Goodfellas stelwarts De Niro and Pesci, and De Niro's long time counterpart (for want of a better word) Pacino, in a no less than three and a half hour long adaptation of Charles Brandt's novel I Heard You Paint Houses. It's testament to what an arduous struggle it's been to make, that it was originally meant to be released years ago, but various issues put obstacles in the way, and now it has premiered on Netflix, before a theatrical release for those more inclined to see it that way. The result is a hugely admirable and rewarding experience, that stops a few shades sort of electrifying to be a masterpiece.Determined to cater to the loyal fanbase, and recast the big name stars everyone's loved and grown up with over the years, Scorsese has placed messieurs De Niro and Pacino in the lead roles again, despite their advanced ages, and so to make things look more realistic, a lot has been made of the 'de-aging' application applied to the stars, in a ground breaking move designed to keep everyone happy. While the grey hairs and face lines are removed from De Niro, it's a sad truth that early on in the role, he still looks too old for it, struggling to convince as a man with a young family just starting out, simply on account of, well, his age (sadly.) While this threatens to sully things early on, after a while you're thoroughly absorbed in the story, and his performance is no less committed, matched by Pacino, in bombastic, powered up mode as the real life Hoffa, whose disappearance this applies some very interpretive speculation to.It doesn't really have exactly the right amount of dynamism and magnetism it needs to keep your attention for such a long length, but it never bores you, or makes you lose interest either, a spectacular accomplishment in itself for a film that is one of the few to rival Lawrence of Arabia in length, or, indeed, De Niro and Scorsese's 1984 epic Once Upon a Time in America (which I've never seen!) ****",9,4,8,4 December 2019

Black Book," Impressive comeback effort from the great Paul Verhoeven
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A boatload of wealthy Jews are slaughtered without mercy while making a secret journey to safety escaping the Nazis. What's special about this atrocity is that their valuables are stolen from them by an unknown German commander. One of the survivors is Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) who witnessed the slaughter of her parents. Now hellbent on finding the guilty party and bringing them down, she joins forces with fellow resistance member Hoffman (Hans Akkermans) to infiltrate the Nazis after gaining the attention of Commander Muntze (Sebastian Koch) where she learns the man behind her parents death is higher up the ranks than she thought.Plenty of older directors still hack away in Hollywood, but Paul Verhoeven seemed to have disappeared off the face of the earth after 2000's Hollow Man. But out of nowhere he reappeared with this smaller scale, more independent offering set during World War II.It has an unusual feel for a Verhoeven film. Gone are his trademark uses of excessive/gratuitous sex/violence/language used to punctuate an intelligent and observant story and instead we have a standard wartime thriller that could have been done by Stephen Spielberg with twice the budget. It has a more mature feel to most of his other stuff and stands out for it. You get the feeling this may even be more of a personal film to him, maybe. It's a gripping and suspenseful thriller with plenty of neat twists and turns to keep you riveted to the end. Plenty of films deal with wartime persecution from the Nazis to the Jews, but this casts a light on a different idea, that that some may have been killed and robbed, with those pretending to be resistance sympathizers setting them up for a very nasty fall.Performances wise, in the lead role, van Houten carries the film strongly as the bereaved/vengeful Stein and her undercover personality Ellis De Veres. She has a great double act with Hoffman as her male partner and James Gandolfini lookalike Waldemar Kobus has presence as the burly officer behind her parent's death. Koch, who I recognized from the brilliant The Lives of Others, delivers an equally solid performance as Muntze, the commander with a tough exterior that hides a sensitive and sympathetic nature that gets him to see the evil of his cause.The strangest Verhoeven film you'll ever see, but also a solid and compelling wartime thriller that perfectly justifies the lengthy running time. ****",9,5,8,28 January 2009
Pirate Radio," Not a comedy classic, but not as bad as some have said
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 18 year old Carl (Tom Sturridge) is sent aboard a boat by his mother after a drugs incident, in the hope it will straighten him out. This, as we find out, is a big mistake, as her old friend Quenten (Bill Nighy) a free spirited, anti establishment figure and the boat is in fact a pirate radio station that transmits pop music to Britain 24-7, while the government gives it just a half hour slot every week. There's a host of colourful characters on board, including American shock jock The Count (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), cruelly funny Dave (Nick Frost) and recently returned from a drugs tour of America, Gavin (Rhys Ifans.) But grumpy, joyless government minister Sir Normandy (Kenneth Brannagh) has been assigned the task of bringing them all down, threatening to destroy their fun loving, free spirited world once and for all...For a film where the plot is really quite a secondary thing, that was quite some summary. Not to say there's anything to think quite too deeply about it, there's just a lot of characters set to a colourful beat. On first glance, TBTR seems like a happy clappy, insufferably cheery 'Brit rom com' and in many ways it is. But this feature which Richard Curtis has written and directed isn't quite as torturous for non aficenados as it would seem. It does manage to be genuinely funny here and there, with decent characters with well cast actors to play them and a superb soundtrack that captures the mood and spirit of the era wonderfully. One notable complaint would be that it's slightly, well, massively overlong, culminating with what seems like a subtle in joke/p!ss take of Titanic which shows how overblown it's become. But if you're into the sort of films I'm usually into, this will be a welcome change and a film you won't regret seeing. ***",7,1,2,15 April 2010
Batman Returns," Extroverted, eccentric but brilliant
","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Welcome back to Gotham City, home of crime and home of the avenger of crime, the legendary Batman (Michael Keaton) a.k.a. millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. While most of the crime emanates from muggers and thieves lurking in backstreet alleys and other grimy places, it's higher up the chain as well. Enter corrupt corporate boss Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), casually putting on a smile for the good people of Gotham whilst secretly running his own dirty little schemes, who's about to make an unexpected new ally. Abandoned by his rich, snobby parents from birth, tossed into the sewer and left to form into a hideously deformed man, The Penguin (Danny DeVito) has grand plans to endear himself to the people of Gotham, run for mayor and secretly fulfill his own hidden agenda to avenge his lot in life on the innocent people. And finally, Selina Kyle (Michelle Phyiffer) a dowdy, nerdy secretary for Shreck who becomes Catwoman, feline avenger of the night and the Penguin's sidekick. It's time for Batman to work his magic and save the city once again...Following the ultra-successful first Batman movie three years prior, a sequel was as inevitable as night following day. And in 1992, it arrived with Batman Returns, and with the same director, Tim Burton and with the same guy behind the mask, Michael Keaton. Given how much I enjoyed the first one, all of this should spell success. And, unlike in later years, where sequels with the same directors and such would start to suck, this was an earlier one that actually fulfilled.If you think of it all in this sense, you could look on it as a re-run of the first in a lot of respects, certainly the same formula, the same dark presentation and even the same running time! But it is, of course, a movie on it's own, with it's own qualities and high-points. It's not one of those 'sequel that's nowhere near as good as the original' types.So, where do we begin? Well, from the beginning. Opening to the sweeping, stirring soundtrack with the same clever camera angles that stylized the original. This is looking raring and set to be another distinctly comic book movie all the way. And it certainly gets stirred up in the eccentricity of it all as events roll on. Secondly, the performances. De Vito works his own unique brand of magic in the role of The Penguin, but he is ultimately side-shadowed by Walken, who manages a quietly menacing, delightfully devilish turn as the evil Shreck. Alledgedly, a vast number of publicity posters were stolen from Warner Brothers marketing department featuring Phyiffer in her Catwoman suit but (call me weird!) I only found her slightly more appealing than Halle Berry in Catwoman at a push. And then finally, there's the script. A delightfully hammy concoction of all the wildest comic book style extroversion you can imagine, combined with Burton's own unique style.Who cares if a bit too much time is focused on the villains and not on the development of Batman himself? Who cares if some of the action does look a bit rubbery (or maybe things have just moved on a bit too much for me?) Who cares if the ending, with the penguins with rocket-packs on their backs is eccentrically extroverted and even laugh-inducingly ridiculous in one sense? This is the ultimate comic book movie, and the last final, fleeting glimpse of Batman in his true, dark sense before the series deteriorated into the vacuous, colourful, chav-vy gloop it did. So three cheers for this, my favourite Batman movie. ****",9,2,4,29 June 2005

Hot Fuzz," Only mildly funny but quite a fun ride nonetheless
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a London copper so good he's embarrassing his superiors and fellow officers. So they transfer him to a sleepy village in Glouster called Sandford, where crime doesn't get much worse than some kids drinking under-age or even someone just dropping litter. It's so quiet even the police don't make much of an effort, which Nick discovers when he's partnered with PC Butterman (Nick Frost), a portly copper fascinated with Nick's big city back ground and Hollywood action movies. Frustrated and bored beyond belief, Nick succombs to a Limbo like existence in this sleepy English town- until residents start getting mysteriously bumped off by an unseen assailant. The finger of suspicion points towards suave, sly super-market owner Simon Skinner (Timothy Dalton) who stands to gain the most from the deaths. But just when things start getting interesting again, Nick starts to discover a truth more baffling than even he could imagine.As a much better reviewer than me has already said, it's unfortunate that Hot Fuzz came out in a week when gun crime had hit the headlines of British newspapers in a manner unprecedented to anything seen before. Even for a film setting out to parody Hollywood action movies and the British mentality to gun violence, many probably thought it in bad taste after the week's shocking events. Still, it doesn't seem to have hurt it's box office performance too badly, being the second film from writer/star comedy duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost after the over-rated but highly successful Shaun of the Dead.As I've already said, it's setting out to send up Hollywood action films and simultaneously mocking the British response to this way of life. I did snigger a few times but I can't say there was anything that really made me explode with laughter. It's more successful as an affectionate tribute to the films it's setting out to take the p*ss out of, beaming through with Frost's character passionately singing the virtues of such films as Bad Boys II and Point Break, just two from his over-flowing library of such films.The film does well performances wise. Pegg is actually really quite convincing as a hard, no nonsense policeman, even though he's playing it for laughs, whilst Frost is great fun in the support role, eagerly and joyfully trying to emulate his big city partner to great effect. As the villain, Dalton's far more restrained than his days where he played James Bond, although it's safe to say he'll now be typecast forever in this dastardly English villain role. And there's also a nice supporting appearance from Jim Broadbent, content to play a secondary character in spite of his wider recognition now.I'd liked to have laughed a bit more, but I can't say I didn't have some nice fun with this film. More than I was expecting after the disappointment after the hype of SOTD. ****",9,2,5,19 April 2007

Constantine," The anti-smoking lobby seem to be at work here...
","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) was born with a gift he didn't want - the ability to see the half-breed angels and demons that walk the earth. But he is a bitter, cynical individual who has squandered his gift and, after smoking 30 cigarettes a day since the age of 15, has now been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. To round all this off, he's also survived a suicide attempt- meaning his entrance to Heaven has been blocked. In an attempt to avert this, he wars with the earth-bound minions of evil. But when the twin sister of a female police detective (Rachel Weiez) dies in an apparent suicide, he stumbles onto a plot to take over the earth that is much greater than he ever imagined.Indeed, the anti-smoking lobby are definitely working their guns here, re-enforcing the cancer and premature death message (not to mention it just being a really filthy habit!) in their downbeat, morbid anti-hero with subtle references and innuendo through-out the film. Indeed, there is an off-puttingly dark, bleak feel to the whole film. That's not helped by a story that is confusing and with a desperate lack of emotional attachment to any of the characters. And then, of course, there's Reeves. He may have head-billed some of the most prominent action films of the last ten or so years, but the fact remains, to paraphrase Jonathon Ross, that we are dealing with an 'impossibly wooden' actor here, chronically devoid of charisma and lacking the ability to really make us engage in any of his characters.The whole thing just seems to be some kind of sub-par take on The Exorcist. Some of the special effects and action are good, but unlike Reeves's previous The Matrix (or, hopefully, even Speed!) one can only see a continuation in the shape of a sequel to this series being, well, a really filthy habit. **",4,1,6,3 June 2005

Brokeback Mountain," I'm still glad that Crash won it, but this is still a very powerful and well-made movie
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits In the early 1960s, two men (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllanhaal) desperate for work take a job herding sheep for a demanding employer. In the cold, lonely hills of Brokeback Mountain they are left to fend for themselves against the elements and eventually, with only each other for company, they begin a homo-erotic affair. This goes against both their personas as men, however, and they are forced to confront themselves before both giving in and admitting it is what they both want. As the years after this incident roll by, they become separated only to eventually be reunited. The film charts their fortunes over the years which never shatters the one thing that holds them true: their love for each other.Quite a fuss got kicked up at this year's Academy Awards, when the independent film Crash won over this, Ang Lee's sprawling biopic of homosexuality among cowboys. While I'm glad about this in a way, having finally seen it, I honestly also wouldn't have minded if this had taken away the gong instead, for although a different film entirely, Brokeback Mountain is a hugely recommendable piece of cinema that is not to be missed.It is a quiet and gently noted film for the most part. Ledger and Gyllanhaal are ideally cast in the leading roles, perfectly suited with Ledger as the troubled macho man and Gylannhaal as the more at ease man. Set up this perfectly, they can both turn in excellent, stirring performances.This is presented exactly as the sort of film the Academy likes to give awards to, and at times does appear a bit pompously arty, but when the end comes you are able to wash over the boring bits and appreciate the film as a whole for what it is, especially as the emotionally devastating climax sets in.If you're mature and rational enough to handle the heavy subject matter, you will be able to derive every ounce of enjoyment out of this excellent drama.

Spotlight," Riveting, considered film-making people don't see so much of these days
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 2001, the Boston Globe received a lead on a child sex abuse scandal that concerned priests in the Catholic church. The ensuing investigation revealed that the accusations weren't limited to just one or two individuals, but in fact spanned many victims over many years around many parts of the globe. Journalists Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams) and Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) and their editor Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery) risk the wrath of some very powerful people to bring the truth to light and expose an earth shattering truth.Spotlight arrives at a time that is quite darkly fitting for its subject matter, certainly on these shores, with a recent report stating that sexual abuse of minors is widespread in a variety of different institutions, including schools, churches, the entertainment industry, care homes and political establishments, that has unmasked an horrific reality behind entities that we took for granted, and always assumed were beyond that sort of indecency. It also highlighted why investigative journalism is so important, and what consequences limiting freedom of the press could have.An all star cast head up the production, including come-back kid Michael Keaton, as the more mature, middle aged member of the group, and Liev Schreiber in a similarly considered role. It's actually Ruffalo who takes centre stage, as one of the main reporters, that will probably divide some opinion. Maybe he's just a little too fixated, laying it on a little too thick and grabbing everything, doing things too intently and coming at people like he's about to attack them, that his performance seems a little hammy. But equally, you could say it's passionate and intense, what makes a role like this work.It doesn't seem to have lasted long at UK cinemas, not surprising when you consider this is the sort of intelligent, considered fare that doesn't come out so much nowadays. But all the same, that's exactly what it is, on a similar theme to All The President's Men forty years ago and equally as shattering in its conclusion. ****",9,0,0,28 February 2016
Terminator Salvation," If all you want is a noisy popcorn blockbuster, it's right up your street, but it won't do for anything else...
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning We're living in the times of recessionary Hollywood, where the studios aren't willing to take a gamble and old ideas are being trotted out in new format in favour of new ideas. Aside from the collosally pointless part three, the great thing about The Terminator franchise is that however many years were spanned out between the last film, there's always been a point to each new film, so a new Terminator movie is hardly the best example of this. It is, however, an established franchise and as such can hold it's own against the torrent of other commercially driven blockbusters on the cinema screens in the summer.The story here is set in the future where John Connor has survived as leader of the resistance in the battle against the machines. However, the boy who will grow to be his father, Kyle Reese, is eeking out an existence of his own, hiding in the ruins of modern civilization and running into contact with a mysterious man who it's hard to tell is a member of the resistance or the machines. It's something fans of the franchise will have been looking forward to for years, with a bright new cast (namely, Christian Bale in the lead role) and a glossy new look. Unfortunately, it is a complete case of style over substance.With the director of the Charlie's Angels films at the helm, this fun but dark franchise had it's fate in uncertain hands to start with. While McG's style might have been ideally suited to the under appreciated (in my opinion) CA films, it might not be as good with a Terminator film. He does get it wrong, but not for the reasons you might have thought, though. A more silly, jolly tone might have been preferable to the onslaught of trite dialogue, thin characterization, weak plotting and wavey story on display here. If all you want is a noisy, effects driven popcorn film with some impressive special effects and CGI, this'll serve you well but as something Terminator fans have been looking forward to for years it's a bit of a let down.No one expects anything to match the first two, but just something with some genuine affection for the series would be nice. With the ending leaving the room open for another film, one hopes something better comes up next time round. **",4,6,12,22 June 2009
Insomnia," Another original film from Christopher Nolan
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsInsomnia is the name of a Stephen King novel,but this is not an adaptation of it.Instead,it is director Christopher Nolan's follow up from his 2000 debut Memento.Much like it's predecessor,it revolves around an original and intriguing premise,and is at least a little thrilling because of this.The film has a substance and style all of it's own,with some impressive cinematography thrown into the equation.On the performances front,Al Pacino brings his usual dark,uncompromising tone to his performance,and Robin Williams has transcended well from comic to serious actor.Even in his comedy films,he's always delivered a certain level of dramatic gusto,and he's carried a solely dramatic film like Patch Adams through wonderfully,but this is an entirely new role,here playing a man eerily at ease with his descent into psychopathy.His next film OneHourPhoto is eagerly awaited,and it will be interesting to see if someone like Jim Carrey takes a similar turn with his career in a few years time,playing a similar sort of role.This is a haunting,absorbing experience.Roll on another soon,Mr.Nolan.*****",Null,0,1,30 August 2002
Aquaman," Visually striking, but little else to hold your attention
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningArthur Curry (Jason Momoa) is a half man, half aquarian warrior, who has been raised on Earth, and uses his special abilities to fight for justice. His latest escapades have seen him rescue an underwater boat from a group of vicious hijackers, one of whom is now eager for revenge. Meanwhile, in his underwater second home, tensions are brewing between rival kings Orm (Patrick Wilson) and Nereus (Dolph Lundgren), plunging him into a desperate inter-world battle, alongside the beautiful Mera (Amber Heard), to discover his true self.Suspension of disbelief is sometimes something you must be willing to engage with any regular movie, but with superhero movies, it's always something of a foregone conclusion, naturally with the inevitable fantasy element that is attached to the story. But, even by these standards, Aquaman, one of the most recent additions to the staple, rather pushes the boundaries. Opening in 1985, Nicole Kidman, as a mermaid, leaps out of the water by some guys house and comes into his life, living as a couple and raising a son (without, it seems, raising any eyebrows or contravening any marriage laws.) But this brief spark of incredulity serves as a sweetener for the lengthy vapidness that is to follow.Jason Momoa was a guy I'd never heard of before this film, and who on the back of it, it would seem, suddenly garnered the star power to charge Â£95 for his autograph at Comic Con. He certainly has the physical frame to fit the title role, and within the constraints of it, pulls off the grunting, edgy, wise-cracking tough guy in a perfectly serviceable manner, but nothing more than is required. The support cast is littered with big names, from Dafoe, Heard, Wilson, Kidman, and Lundgren making a pleasing big screen return in a none fighting role, all of whom are pretty much equally perfunctory.The film's big saving grace is it's magnificent visual spectacle, with some amazing CGI capturing a wonderous underwater kingdom, along with some snazzy costume design and amazing action. But it's at least twenty minutes too long and over indulgent, with a threadbare, unengaging story and empty, soulless performances. And that renders all that pretty meaningless. **",4,2,2,27 January 2020
Juno," Delivers slightly more than you'd expect but still very much only for an audience that 'likes' this kind of film
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The titular Juno (Ellen Page) is an off-beat young woman in a small US town who finds herself unexpectedly pregnant. Although the father, Bleeker (Michael Cera) is someone she is on good terms with, this isn't how she planned her life and so she tries to sell her baby off to wealthy suburban couple Vannessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark (Jason Bateman) whilst dealing with all the emotional complications along the way.Despite the mostly favourable reviews this has received, Juno didn't look like the type of film I would plan to see. But, ma and pa ordered it along with another film and since it was lying around I thought: why not, I may as well. While I haven't seen a film that I'm likely to remember or that I can honestly say is one of the best films I've seen this year, this is undeniably an intelligent, well written comedy film from director Jason Reitman. Clever though the writing is, ironically it also created some problems with me. Firstly, without stereotyping, from what popular culture has lead me to believe, American teenagers are certainly not this smart or talk in such a smart and sophisticated way. Further-more, if Juno is this intelligent and worldly wise at her tender age, why has she not heard of contraception, which would have stopped her problems in the movie altogether? Not really my type of film, then, but better than expected and one of the better comedies of the year, probably. ****",9,3,7,13 September 2008
L.A. Confidential," One of the best films ever made and quite possibly the best film of the 90s
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 1950s Los Angeles is a place that's trying to spruce up some glamour and recognition. But it's also suffering at the hands of a corrupt police force, lead by dodgy captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) who uses heavies to force would-be crime lords out of town, and also Bud White (Russell Crowe) an abuser of power who gets his job done more with his fists than his handcuffs. But there's a new boy on the scene- Edmond Exley (Guy Pearce), vying to become seargent at the age of thirty. His father was killed in the line of duty but he plays strictly by the book and has a natural yearning for justice. Needless to say, their paths soon cross- but when some people, including White's partner, are found murdered in an all night diner called The Night Owl, an intricate web of lies and deceit is unravelled and the two may have more in common than they thought.Everyone has this image in their heads of the 1950s being a happy, rosy time, 'the good old days' when everything was decent and proper. James Ellroy is a detective novelist who shatters all those conceptions, throwing in our face an era as decadent and corrupt as now, if not more so, with corruption everywhere and everyone on the take. And Curtis Hanson has brought his vision to life perfectly.L.A. Confidential has more twists and turns than a rattle snake, a rich, multi-layered story that you can pick up new things on every time you watch it (mind you, the film's so good you'll be dying to watch it again as soon as you can anyway.) It is also completely unflinching when it comes to showing the more intense, raw parts of the story, in the most realistic, hard-hitting way that just adds to the overall great effect.He has also succeeded in bringing the day and age the film is set in to life perfectly as well, with the soundtrack, production design and costumes all spot on. It literally feels as though you're living right in the story as it's going on.And the performances don't disappoint. Former Neighbours stars Pearce and Crowe made big names for themselves here, Pearce as the fiercely straight, determined officer, one good cop who holds on to his integrity in a department sinking in corruption and Crowe as the officer more in favour of rough justice, who's always brimming with a boiling anger that could snap at any minute. The supporting cast are all on fire as well, Kevin Spacey (rising star at the time) as the show-bizzy glamour cop who likes all the attention but has his heart in the right place, Kim Basinger as the torn love interest, Cromwell as the seemingly infallible captain and Danny DeVito as the sleazy journo always sniffing where the money is.Everything about L.A. Confidential is perfect. It all comes together in the right way and everything works. The publicity and hype was always going to mean Titanic would win the Oscar, but how right that this is the film that's been remembered by true lovers of film for longer. It really is so rare for film-making to get it this right. *****",10,1,2,16 October 2007

Meanwhile, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is trapped by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) in his own version of hell but he soon finds his old friends and joins them in bringing the bullies down.No way was I sitting through this in the cinema. After the under-whelming last instalment which scuppered the memory of the excellent first film, I did not fancy spending nearly three hours twitching and fidgeting through what was bound to be an almost equally bad prequel.Now I've finally seen it on DVD (free to watch it at my own pace), I guess I can't complain too much. Anyone who sat through The Return of the King can't either, because the pace is nowhere near as slow and there's none of that nonsense with the bits where you think it's ended and then it hasn't. Jack Sparrow is still quintessentially Johnny Depp's role, and although he looks a little creaky here, he still tries to give it his all. Knightley is good as feisty support, and Keith Richards makes his cameo as Sparrow's dad but Bloom is still terminally wooden and there's not much more to the cast than that.It's a stylish, slick, polished effort with a lot of flair put into it. But this series really went downhill after the first one. **",4,0,0,27 May 2008

However, when girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) announces she is pregnant, he plans a new life and settling down with her, only to lose her at the hands of some vengeful associates of some bad guys he tackled. Plunged into a depressed slump, he is pulled out of it when Russell (Julian Dennison), a young boy with super fire powers, lashes out at the brutal headmaster (Eddie Marsan) who's abusing him. Deadpool must then protect him from the time travelling Cable (Josh Brolin) who wants to eliminate Russell for what he becomes in the future...The 2016 comic book caper Deadpool was one of those cult, sleeper hits that was practically crying out for a sequel. Rather than splurge one out less than twelve months after the first one came out, director David Leitch has given time for that film to absorb into the cultural consciousness, and the result is a film that hits a higher note because of it. This time around, it feels on more dynamic a scope, with a more ambitious script that wants to crank the fun level up another notch. And, with everyone on board in on the act and having fun, the result is for the most part a resounding success.Returning in the lead role, Reynolds is once again suitably snarky and cool as the wise-cracking renegade, and the films tongue-in-cheek vibe is once again suitably in check. Like last time, it's loaded with pop culture references, some of which have developed since the last film (namely involving George Michael!) With all this, it's surprising that the film chooses to include such dark themes as grief and revenge in it, which may have been included in the last film, but not to such a sharp extent. It starts like this from the off-set, followed by a bizarre opening credits parody of James Bond films that feels ambiguous.It's still great fun, though, not taking itself seriously at all for the most part, with some fantastic action sequences, cool, funky new characters and just generally being a very colourful and entrancing follow up. A third and final instalment should be okay on the basis of this. ****",9,3,7,24 May 2018
X-Men," Leaves room for a sequel
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsX-Men is ultimately the kind of movie pretty much designed for a follow up.If the inspiration at the end for one doesn't work,the amount of people filling the cinema on the opening weekend should ,of course,fuel the profits to make a sequel.Judging by how cramped a certain cinema reportedly was during one screening,profits must have been rolling in by the dozen.But,sadly in a way,X-Men ultimately emerges as the kind of film of which the advanced publicity must have made a lot of this cash,and,most of the reviews must have pretty much got washed under the carpet.The film itself is certainly quite good.There's a lovely opening score at the beginning ,which manages to last throughout,and endears the film throughout,adding a delightfully campy '70's style tone to it.But it's slow to really build up to the main action.All the good guys and bad guys,including their leaders,are all quite interesting,but they are never really explored to their full potential.The superb Patrick Stewart is also rather terribly wasted as the head good guy.The ending,with all the flashy,vibrant ,FX showdowns ,is worth the wait,but the lack of investment into the characters does'nt make the outcomes awfully careworthy.However,Brian Singer's terminally dark direction does'nt go unnoticed,and adds a unique clarity to the picture.It's also a relatively short film,which is fast moving ,and will therefore stand more chance of appealing to the pre-teen age group it is targeted at.The ending holds a strange magnetism to it as well,and the compact cube prison thing is well made,as are the attachment's that go to it.The film also has it's well timed humorous interludes,including Wolverine's bizarre initial dislikement of Cyclops,as well as it's rendering interludes,such as Rogue's destroyed life before becoming part of the X 'MEN' team.On the subject of this,the film dos'nt really do well for itself in having attractive babes like Famke Janssen and Halle Berry in roles,obviously designed to evoke the testosterone of men,not least because it puts the actual title of the film at odds with itself.It's doubtful you'll be sorry for paying to see X-Men if your already into this kind of thing,but it may not quite unravel the way you'd been expecting it to.***",Null,0,0,20 August 2000

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) has now died down a bit as a phenomenon and is now more of a neighbourhood service, doing his duty and delving out justice to the low-lives of Manhattan. But his old friend Harry (James Franco) still has a score to settle with him over the death of his father and returns as the 'New' Goblin, ready to wreak vengeance on his old friend. But a freak accident lands him in hospital with severe memory loss (and just as well because villains wise in this film he's already got his work cut out.) So with him out the picture, Ol' Spidey must now battle the inner villain within himself when an evil new serum attaches itself to him, causing his suit to turn black and making his vicious instincts to come to life. These come in full force when he discovers the identity of his grand-father's real killer Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who's just escaped from prison and has been turned into The Sandman, capable of morphing into a giant indestructible monster who can take on anything. In the face of his biggest challenge yet, Peter must defeat his greatest enemy as well as the raging evil within himself.With the rave reviews for the last two films still ringing fresh in my mind, I was expecting the final instalment in the Spider-Man franchise to receive similar glaring words. But I was as surprised as probably anyone was when it received a barrage of not awful but distinctly average reviews. A big complaint has been too many villains and I would agree with everyone on that. In fact it speaks volumes that the film's most memorable moment comes not with one of Spider-Man's showdowns with one of these villains, but with a spectacular action sequence involving a giant building block crashing into a skyscraper, causing everything (and everyone) in it to come plummeting out of it.This aside, I also want to niggle about the theme and tone of the film, involving Peter's quest for revenge and battle against the inner demons raging inside him. Batman is a dark hero, Spider-Man I think is more of an undemanding kind of hero, and the whole dark tone of the film I felt was totally mis-placed.I'm sure it won't be the worst blockbuster out this year, but I must say I'm glad Sam Raimi has finally closed the lid on the downward spiralling Spider-Man franchise and that there won't be any more to tarnish the memory of the highly enjoyable original. **",4,0,0,27 May 2007
Yes Man," Funny in parts, but mostly doesn't work as a film
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) works in a bank, spending his time rejecting most of the loans customers apply for. Outside of work, he has a negative attitude that sees him missing out on a lot in life, including the engagement party of his good friend Peter (Bradley Cooper.) He bumps into an old friend who takes him to a self help seminar where a guru embraces him to say 'yes' to everything-and actually puts a curse on him where saying 'no' will result in something bad. Before long, Carl's saying 'yes' to literally everything, causing complications in his work life and personal life.I've become quite an avid reader of Danny Wallace's '...is a man' column in ShortList Magazine, which I pick up for free every Thursday on my way into work. The man has an undeniable way with words and for bringing fairly ordinary situations he's found himself in during the past week to life in the most vivid and outrageous way possible, I call to mind his experiences in a chip shop with a drunk guy who thought he was mute, sitting behind a guy on a train who talked loudly into his mobile while placing a large order and confrontations with builders outside his home. This is an adaptation of a novel he wrote based on a philosophy he adapted in his own life where he had too much of a negative attitude. I haven't read it (hadn't even heard about it!) but I'm sorry to say Yes Man hasn't translated into a great film.There are some very funny moments (that are uniquely Wallace in their hilariousness), but as a whole the film is very hard to get into and fails to really hold your attention. In the lead role, Carrey seems to have matured and refrains from too much gurning and mugging (except from a scene where he's consumed too much Red Bull!) but he can't work to his best with the weak material. With the current economic climate, a scene where he's reprimanded for granting too many loans may even be seen as tasteless by some. I'm just nit picking now, but the fact is this is a disappointing film that only manages to be sporadically funny. **",4,2,4,10 May 2009
Zodiac," Lengthy but worthwhile serial killer yarn from David Fincher
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The 'Zodiac killer' began his reign of terror in the San Francisco area in the late 1960s, killing young couples in isolated areas. He would continue his sick little game for another two decades and several detectives, including Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) would be driven round the bend in their desperate hunt for him.Despite the rave reviews, Zodiac was a film I still managed to miss when it showed in theatres. Maybe it had something to do with Se7en never being one of my favourite flicks, but more likely it was the length. I'm one of these people who loves the cinema but suffers from horrible bum-ache if I'm required to sit down in a cinema seat for too long.Towards the end of the film, it has started to drag on a little and the plot has begun to get a bit wavey and meandering, but generally Fincher has crafted a gripping tale that won me over more than Se7en. Whereas that film was relentlessly bleak and moody, here that tone is mixed with scenes with a bit more humour and light, as well as a funky, cool 70s soundtrack. Two scenes do stand out as especially unsettling, namely a scene where a couple are tied up and stabbed to death by a lake and a killing in a taxi cab where the camera slowly backs away as 'Ring a Ring of Roses' creepily plays over it.There would need to be some good performances to keep the boat floating, of course, and the cast all deliver, with Gyllenhaal showing his developing maturity as a serious actor in the lead role, along with good support from Ruffalo and a straight and sober Downey Jr., making his role all his own as the eccentric older detective.Too many people would disagree with me for it to have effect but personally I'd say Fincher has shown a better knack for real serial killer stories than made up ones. ****",9,1,3,21 November 2007
The Prestige," Well made but off-puttingly complicated at times, especially towards the end
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning London, the turn of the Century. Magic is where the money is, turning the crowds out in their droves. And the top magicians of the times are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale.) They are rivals, but friendly rivals, engaging in a healthy sense of competition with each other. But Borden publicly denounces the tiredness of Angier repeatedly churning out the same crowd-pleasing tricks and demands something new. So they team up to pull off an idea of Borden's together, with tragic results. Angier's wife is killed and, blaming Borden, they become bitter rivals. But when Borden comes up with a new and innovative idea that wows the crowds, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to unwork it. So obsessed, bitterness, betrayal and murder become par for the course.Director Nolan seems obsessed with becoming Britain's answer to M Night Shyamalan with his high-concept sort of movies. He's doing a better job of it of late, that's for sure, and with the next Batman movie out soon, he's going to get the most commercial drive. But in between he's managed to make The Prestige, which will be unforgettable but not because it's great.Well, it's quite a good movie, if you can follow it, which I'm not sure many will be able to. This is such a complicated and multi-layered story that you'll be scratching your head more than once while it runs. But that, of course, actually makes it all the more intelligent, and you can't complain about that.The title, by the way, refers to the final act of the magic act, which Michael Caine's character guides us through in the early stages of the film. As he's stated before, he only acts for the joy of it these days without commanding a hefty fee, but there's nothing wrong with his performance here. He's just the start of the supporting cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and a surprise appearance from musician David Bowie.A good film, then, but maybe a bit too complicated and off-puttingly so for some viewers. #241 in the IMDb Top 250 is pushing it a bit. ***",7,2,4,6 May 2007
The Terminator," Set a standard in sci-fi action films that has rarely been beaten and has endured for many years
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the year 2029, mankind is in a desperate battle with The Machines, that have risen from the ashes of the last war. Through a time travelling portal, exceptional soldier Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) has travelled back in time to the year 1984, to protect Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who will be the mother of John Connor, the leader of the Resistance. But Skynet, the computer defence system that set the machines on the world, has sent its own agent along, in the shape of The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a robotic soldier fitted with human flesh that is programmed to complete its mission at all costs.Re-released (in selected theatres) earlier this year to coincide with the release of the far inferior, effects driven Terminator: Genysis, fans of the franchise were taken back to where it all began, the rollicking roller-coaster ride, with breath taking special effects (for the time), pulse pounding action sequences and a far fetched, but conversely intelligent and elaborate story that no doubt played a big part in making it stand the test of time. In 1984, The Terminator was simply unlike anything anyone had ever seen before, and today could serve as an abject lesson to the effects-over-substance brigade.For anyone who never got in to the Conan films, this was the film that presented Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Mr. Universe champion turned actor, to the world. While not exactly oozing with what you'd call traditional acting talent, here his expressionless demeanour and cold, thick Austrian voice suited the skin of a cold blooded killer perfectly. He's no psychopath, though. He knows exactly what he's doing. Or, rather, what he's been programmed to do. And either him or his prey will have to be dead by the end for it to end. Sarah Connor's slow, dawning realization that her life is in danger is brilliantly orchestrated, after two women with the same name and the same age have already been dispatched and she becomes suspicious of everyone around her.It all builds to an explosive (literally) finale, where the killing machine is stripped to its bare bones and pursues his already worn down assailants inside a factory. Although its one of many effects that look a bit sub par now, somehow the tension and terror is no less palpable. And Arnie's 'I'll be back' line is still somehow cool and as welcome in pop culture circles as ever. *****",10,0,0,15 December 2015
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Satisfying, above average comic book thriller about on a par with the original
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning It's another ordinary day for Hellboy (Ron Perlman) in the life of a half human, half demon crime fighter. He's having mild relationship problems with fire-morphing girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) and continues to be mentored by his adoptive father Professor Bruttenholm (John Hurt.) But a new storm is brewing in the shape of Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) an immortal who's been living underground for many years. He wants to resurrect the 'golden army', so they can tear down the modern world and restore it to a world of anarchy and mayhem. He's even willing to kill his own father and turn on his sister to get it. Needless to say, Hellboy's gotta whoop some hellfire on his ass.This delayed sequel to the above average 2004 comic book offering Hellboy comes complete with the same director in the shape of Gullirmo Del Toro and with him, his distinctive, quite awe inspiring flair for visual design and prosphetic make-up. Hellboy II comes to life in front of the audience as a surreal, mesmerizing fantasy, quite a visual feast for the eyes, and for more reasons than just the aforementioned. To wit, one of the most bizarre but downright funny moments of the filmic year as the big red one drowns his sorrows, with science whizz buddy Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) to the tune of Barry Mannilow's Can't Smile Without You. While other superhero movies may be trying to be all cool and trendy with the dark, Gothic look, one thing Hellboy II couldn't be accused of is taking itself too seriously, with it's lead hero quipping 'oh hell' every two seconds and responding to such threats as 'you'll pay for this' with lines such as 'do you take cheques?', before his assailant unleashes a seed that gives rise to a giant monster that wants to give the Cloverfield monster some competition. It may have an apathetic plot that only serious comic book enthusiasts will really care about, but the audience were hopefully smart enough to know what to expect and enjoyed it accordingly.I didn't find it quite as enjoyable as everyone else has said, to be honest, but while not better than the original (what is?) this is a sequel that's certainly on a par with it. And that's more than you can say for a lot. ***",7,0,2,15 September 2008
Cloverfield," Looks like King Kong's got some competition...
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Morning *** Friday Night ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Some up scale Manhattan teenagers are celebrating the leaving do of one of their top mates, only to hear a loud crashing noise outside and for absolute chaos and pandemonium to follow quickly after. Hordes of panicky people start rampaging through the city, running, rioting and looting and the destruction doesn't seem to be stopping. It soon becomes clear that a huge monster is stampeding through the city, with no clear plan of attack and destroying everything in it's path. This is one problem that'll take more than Mayor Giuliani to sort out.Okay, I'm not watching anymore films set in New York for the rest of the year until I've actually been. I said it in my recent I Am Legend review and I'm saying it now. I want my first ever trip there later this year to be as big a surprise as possible and I don't want to see all the best bits in the films before I go, thank you very much.There, now I've got that little rant off my chest lets get onto the actual film itself. It's one of those weird, high concept films that's been doing pretty well mainly down to word of mouth and will now probably get a cult status as a result. And I'm happy to say, it does really deserve it.Spinning off from the style of The Blair Witch Project, with it's use of a hand-held camera recording the words and actions of unknown actors in the face of absolute terror, the film creates an impressive mood of claustrophobia and bewilderment, with some genuinely terrifying jump moments to move it along. A big budget must have been required for the monster effects and special effects through-out but the film is shot all the way through in camcorder footage, which some have struggled to adapt to, but in these post 9/11 (which was first caught on camera) days is actually all the more terrifying, even if at times you want to laugh out loud at how ludicrous and far fetched the story actually is, as well as the absurdity of someone filming it all at a time when they must be quavering for their lives.Kong was taken to NY against his will. The Cloverfield monster wants to be there. And you want to see him. ****",9,0,3,1 March 2008

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsMars Attacks and the Batman films (Batman Returns especially)were extremely enjoyable,but Sleepy Hollow fails to develop into much of an engaging story at all.The distinctly gothic tone moreorless dominates the picture ,but there just is'nt much of a plot to the film.Christina Ricci was quite beautiful,and how the headless horseman is eventually dealt with is quite intriguing to watch,but that,sadly,is really all there is.*",Null,0,1,29 August 2000
Silent Hill," Probably better if you've played the game first
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Adapted from a video game (which I've never played) Silent Hill hits us on the big screen full-on with it's movie version of itself.Rose (Radha Mitchell) is a lady who's daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) has been suffering nightmares about a town called Silent Hill. Determined to find out what's causing these, she travels out to the town itself with the hope of confronting her fear and stopping it. However, after a freak traffic accident, she wakes up in the snow covered town with no memory of what happened before- and her daughter is missing! In the distance, she sees a semblance of her little girl running away from her. But, after chasing it, she finds this is just the beginning of a nightmare journey into a terrifying hell-hole to get her little girl back.This is just Resident Evil re-lived, for the most part, complete with minimal characterization, a naff narrative and a similarly apathetic storyline all round really, which makes no real sense through-out and is only barely satisfactorily resolved at the end. However, you can enjoy a few scenes with a nice soundtrack and visual flair, some enjoyable, nice (if obviously computer generated) special effects and Sean Bean in a co-starring role doing an impressive American accent (which only occasionally lapses back into his native Yorkshire.) Overall, though, this is one idea probably best suited to the games console. **",3,1,5,14 May 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Not quite Schindler's List, but still a really absorbing and powerful film that serves as a real eye-opener to what goes on in the world under our noses
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits In 1994, the UN, in a rare act of competence, have managed to broker a peace agreement between the warring hutus and tutsis in Rwanda, Africa. But all this is thrown into disarray when the African president is murdered and tutsi rebels are suspected. The local militia begin a nasty campaign of genocide against them and those suspected of working with them. One such person ends up being Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) a hotel owner who witnesses the horrific carnage for himself and is forced into action when his own family get caught up in the slaughter campaign.He ends up saving thousands of lives. Hotel Rwanda serves best as a modern Schindler's List, a Schindler's List with colour, although that doesn't make the story it is telling any less bleak or harrowing. It's a few notches away from the quality of that film though.In the lead role, Cheadle plays it stern and serious all the way, with a real conviction for his passion to the project. He has a heavy supporting cast too, from Nick Nolte, Joaquim Phoenix and Jean Reno, who only marginally manage to capture his sincerity.I was expecting the film to be a bit longer, actually, but it manages to wrap it all up perfectly as it goes.Hotel Rwanda is a startling film, depicting things that I know go on everyday in foreign countries but don't watch the news very often and, like many others, sort of pretend isn't happening to an extent. Although everything in this film happened when I was a child, things like this probably are still going on and it's good that there are films like this about to kick people into reality a bit. ****",9,1,1,20 August 2005
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Taut, compelling political thriller, the sort of high brow stuff that never gets made into a big blockbuster anymore
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Adapted from the John La Carre novels that were made into a TV mini series in the 70s, the film opens in the early 70s during the height of the cold war, where British Intelligence suspect a Russian spy has infiltraited their ranks. On a mission in Norway, Agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) is apparently killed after things don't work out as planned. Now, Control (John Hurt) has narrowed the suspect down to four people and has called in the assistance of recently ousted Intelligence Analyst George Smiley (Gary Oldman) to get to the bottom of the matter. But as he does, he finds everyone around him increasingly harder to trust.In the heat of the recession era movie industry, where endless, soulless brain dead, big budget popcorn fodder the big movie execs know will rake in the big bucks is the only thing that gets shoved in our faces, it's even more dis-spiriting that here we have another re-make...but a re-make that is of the more high brow, intelligent, sophisticated end of the market, a cerebral political thriller that demands all your attention and makes it's pay off by gripping you right to the end. Given the average movie goer of this generation (me, anyway) has the attention span of an amoeba, given it's exposure to excessive advertising, popular culture and MTV, it may be a flick that will require two viewings in order to take it all in and pick up on stuff you may have missed the first time round, but if you can figure it all out on your first viewing more power to you.Performances wise, Oldman does what he was born to do, naturally inhibiting the body and voice of an experienced, weary old political hack, whilst Hurt provides reliable support as the eccentric, campy man at the top and Strong raises his profile as the elusive, mysterious agent and that's not to mention support from the likes of Kathy Burke, Colin Firth and Stephen Graham, and with a line up like that you know you're on surefire ground.Although it's not an original idea, it somehow remains a taut and compelling one that is as dynamic as it originally was (apparantly) and is an encouraging sight given all the meaningless, big budget drivel we have to endure nowadays. ****",9,1,1,4 July 2012
The Hateful Eight," Tests your patience, but all builds up to a satisfying pay-off
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In Wyoming, at the end of the Civil War, bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is making his way across the snow drenched mountains with his charge Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who is to be hanged. He runs into Major Marcus Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), with whom he strikes up an uneasy alliance, and they make their way to a secluded cabin. There, they encounter a whole host of colourful characters, including British hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), surly cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), who just wants to get home for Christmas, and grouchy old confederate General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern.) But their circumstances for being there may not be as innocent as it seems.I recently brought a box set of what are all presumably regarded as Tarantino's finest films, which, owning a lot of DVDs as I do, helps to condense space and make room for other titles to be added. Despite his highly acclaimed status in the film world, the man is highly selective, and in comparison with other contemporaries, has only really made a handful of films in a twenty five year career. This box set not only seemed to comprise presumably his finest films, but also seemed to serve as a summary of his defining years, when he established his style as a film-maker, before he took a break for a few years, and tried to make films on a grander, more ambitious scale.The Hateful Eight is the latest film made in a style that those familiar with Tarantino's films of more recent times will be familiar, and older devotees perhaps more weary of. The first hour/half hour or so gives off the impression of him paying homage to the films he was fond of in his youth, leaving a pretentious, self indulgent air that seems the staple-mark of his work of late. His trademark use of dialogue and exposition to establish a scene is in evidence, but does nothing to convey any sense of suspense or excitement. It really tests your patience like this for quite a while, but somehow if you bear with it, once the fingers start pointing and the guns start shooting, it does pay off, and becomes a lot more intelligent and intricate, building to an unexpected and highly satisfying climax.Cast wise, Tarantino favourite Jackson reliably takes centre stage again, eventually joined by other familiar QT faces Madsen and Roth, doing an obviously phony but enjoyably campy accentuated Brit voice. The 'comeback' stars, being another of the man's 'trademark' touches, would probably be Russell and Leigh. While these two fail to develop what could be deemed a 'double act', individually they each carry off the personas of two grumpy, hate filled individuals quite well. Towards the end, new face Channing Tatum even shows up to maybe give some appeal to a younger crowd.It really could have done with a more involving opening, which would usually spell the death knell for most films. QT really needs to try and connect once again with his original style of film making, where his short and sweet approach worked wonders whilst applying his trade mark use of dialogue and atmosphere. All you can do is test your endurance and stick around for the impressive and satisfying final round. ****",9,4,14,6 February 2016

Crash," The best film of the year so far!!!
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Los Angeles. A place of massive cultural diversity, that doesn't always go hand in hand together.A man has been found murdered on the side of a lay-by. There's the black detective with the hispanic wife who's leading the case. His brother is a tear-away who couldn't have chosen a different life. There's the district attorney, obsessed with public appearance and his constantly angry, fussy wife. Their car is robbed by two young black men who've only become what they are because the society they live in has inadvertently allowed them to. The couple's door-lock is being fixed by a dodgy looking gang-member type who's in fact only trying to make ends-meet for his daughter. He gets into a dispute with his employer, an immigrant salesman who everybody mistakes him and his family for Iraqis. There's the reserved music producer and his wife who chastises him for not being manly enough, stopped by a cop with a dying dad and a racist grudge. There's his rookie partner, nervous about making a stand against it.Cleverly combining the twin threats of a city already on the edge with a lot of post 9/11 angst still running rife, Crash is an intelligent, powerful, thoughtful, compelling and absorbing study of how prejudice and unjust phobia can tear not only a community apart but a city apart. It's an inspired and clever idea, high-lighting a lot of the potential ways in which the strife is caused. It shows not only the effect on the society, but on the soul as well, with the powerful score and the silent parts.As for the cast, it's really a mix of those who's careers are already on a high and those who'll be lucky to be offered something as deep and meaningful again in years. Having seen Hotel Rwanda just last week, Don Cheadle continues to shine here in one of the lead roles. The film has a similar feel to Traffic, another film he was in, and it looks like he'll have a career appearing in these kind of arty, high-brow flicks and good for him that he's appearing in roles that are worthy of his talents. There's good work too from Sandra Bullock and, continuing to distance himself from his goofy earlier work, Brendan Fraser. Speaking of which, rap star Ludicrous is really one of the main stars of the show here, creating a great contrast with his clever, insightful presence here with his role in the slightly less provocative 2 Fast 2 Furious. Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillipe, two actors who've always left a bit to be desired, surprise and shine here and create a great double act as the harder, more influential older cop and the vulnerable, more naive rookie. And as for Thandie Newton, well, all I'll say is if I'd judged her on the basis of The Chronicles of Riddick (the only film I remember seeing her in!) I'd have been missing out on a lot. The remainder of the supporting cast are all very good as well.The film is directed by Canadian Paul Haggis, who's only other theatrical release has been the little heard-of 1993 movie Red Hot. He handles it all well right until the end with the cloying use of the okay but woodenly over-used Stereophonics hit Maybe Tomorrow over the closing credits. But other than that, this is the best film of the year so far and one Crash that really makes an impact. *****",10,6,15,23 August 2005
Snatch," Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, eh eh, eh eh, cuba cuba cuba cuba...
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Guy Ritchie's follow-up to Lock, Stock opens with Turkish (Jason Statham) and Tommy (Stephen Graham) two unlicensed boxing promoters getting roped into rigging a bare-knuckle fight with feared local kingpin Brick Top (Alan Ford.) They find a contender in the shape of loose-cannon Irish gypsy One Punch Mickey O' Neill (Brad Pitt) who doesn't play up to his part of the deal, setting off a violent chain of events. Juxtaposed with this story is one of a diamond thief and gambling addict called Frankie Four Fingers (Bencio Del Toro) who has gone missing in London. Interested in finding him is American head honcho Avi (Dennis Farina) who enlists the help of feared local goon Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) a hard-man with an inexplicable love of Madonna's hit single Starlight. These are just some of the crazy characters that fall into this crazy equation.I went out my way to see Lock, Stock when it was released a few years earlier, so why I've waited this long to finally see Snatch for the first time I don't know but now I have, as well as seeing the other non Ritchie Brit gangster flick Layer Cake a few years ago. Having seen it, I'm surprised actually how this ended up with an 18 and Layer Cake was awarded a 15, despite the violence actually being considerably worse in that film. Sure, there is a scene where a guy blows his brains out and we see a load of blood splatter on the wall, but to a sensitive 15 year old, that could just be explained as a tin of paint exploding, as opposed to the actual blood laden shootings we do see in Layer Cake. There's also the big hand chopping scene I'd been built up to in this film but that turned out to be a big non event.As for the actual quality of the film itself, we do have a very impressive gangster film on our hands here, with very intricate characters in a very intricate story. A lot of Brit gangster films get accused of trying to copy American films like Goodfellas or the Godfather movies, but Pitt himself wanted a role in this. As well as him, the film has a whole colourful cast of recognizable faces.Despite all the swearing and violence going on, the film somehow manages to maintain a very light-hearted tone through-out, with some very funny characters in the shape of the incompetent black yardies (and their dog!) It's a slick, classy gangster movie (and, in case you can't tell, I liked the song at the end!) ****",9,1,2,25 February 2006
The Expendables," A mouth watering offer that just falls short of being awful but is a far way from perfect
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Sometimes, a film comes along that offers so much on a plate and sets itself up to meet so many standards, that surely the result can only possibly be absolute perfection or one of the worst disasters of all time. In this case, and certainly for this critic, fans of 80s action movies and the stars which have retained an unwavering fan base to this day, namely director/star Stallone and some fellow relics, and some relatively young blood in comparison. In terms of star power, certainly, for the discerning action fan, The Expendables seems a mouth watering, irresistible prospect, with so much talent on display that together as one may be expected to deliver more than maybe on their own. Stallone is in on what he's presenting, a knowing throw back to the ultra violent, mindless, trashy action classics from their heyday in the 1980s. No one with an inkling of knowledge on these most guilty of pleasures would be expecting or looking forward to anything more than an undemanding slice of entertainment, which they could sit back, switch their brain off to and enjoy. In other words, no one should actually have expected too much of The Expendables in the first place. The sad thing is that it fails on this most simplest of counts, managing to fare as neither one of the worst films of all time or an action classic. Just an instantly forgettable mush that leaves no real mark at all.The suitably apathetic plot has Stallone as Barney Ross, leader of the titular group of soldiers called in to risky situations, who finds himself approached by a mystery man to head to the South American island of Vilena to overthrow a seemingly power mad dictator, only to find he and his team may have been pawns in a game by the CIA to take out a rogue agent (Eric Roberts), who believes having power and money gives men the right 'to act like the a$$holes nature intended them to be.' Everything fails to go to plan, and the team retreat from the island, only for Ross's love of a woman there to tempt him to return there and save the day.I don't mind that it's dumb. I don't mind that it's contrived (Stallone and co. bursting in just as some soldiers are about to extinguish a cigarette on his lady love...) or that it's predictable. I just wanted it to be fun, and this is sadly where the movie fails. For all it's blood splattering, shoot outs and cool explosions, it's shot in a turgid grey lens, and the humour fails to flow (despite the scene where Stallone meets Arnie and Bruce, and cracks about being president are made!) Stallone appears suitably bulked up, but his face is showing the signs of time, despite any surgery he may have had. It's nice to see Dolph Lundgren on the big screen again, but he has very much a supporting role here and his character fails to make any real impact, ditto Mickey Rourke after his recent acclaim for The Wrestler. Jet Li doesn't appear to be speaking English as well as he can, and Roberts is a weak, cardboard villain. Jason Statham delivers the most out of all, and his more charismatic presence would have been better served in, well, a better film.This ends up coming off like the recent Righteous Kill, where all the hype of De Niro and Pacino being on screen together failed to live up to expectation. If Stallone had got this gang together maybe as recently as ten years ago, the results may have been better. As it is, it's showing the wear of time worse than it's stars. **",4,7,16,23 August 2010
Scary Movie 2," Good,but inevitably not as much so as the original
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsPart of the tagline to the original Scary Movie said 'no sequel.'However,seeing how successful (and rightfully so) the original was and seeing how this type of movie usually gets some kind of follow up anyway,this has not been adhered.And,despite many bad reviews,the sequel performed just as well at the box office as the original did.This could well have been because it was released around the time of September 11,when the movie-going public needed something light hearted and funny to keep them going.But the film can actually in this reviewer's opinion succeed on its own levels.It's almost as funny as the first film,just not quite.It begins,however,with a rather unfunny and pointless Exorcist parody (what's the point,Leslie Nielsen's Repossessed had already done that.)But from here on in,the laughs,aided by the wisely short running time and Anna Faris's attractive appearance,flow thick and fast.***",Null,0,1,12 March 2002
Pan's Labyrinth," A weird and wonderful film, but sadly not one I could get into
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Despite going more commercial with the Hellboy films, Spanish special effects wunderkind Gullirmo Del Toro has probably made more of a name for himself with this cult, subversive independent film set against the backdrop of Franco's Spain. Shot in his native homeland, with no doubt a fraction of the budget, he's still managed to produce some incredible special effects that are truly a wonder to the eye and mind. And his tale of a young girl caught between the conflict of a band of freedom fighters and the fascist dictatorship her father is part of who escapes into a wonderful fantasy land to escape the harsh reality of her existence has promise and a pleasant charm all of it's own. Sadly, I could not get involved in the plot at all and it simply failed to engage me through-out. Still, it's made an impression on many others and is likely to remain a cult classic for some time to come. **",4,6,11,17 December 2008
Blade II," If you weren't keen on the original,the sequel won't be any more enjoyable
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsWith a different director,and premise,even though I wasn't keen on the original,I thought I never know and would give the sequel a try.As it happens,it was no more enjoyable than the first.Admittently,the sequel does have a very impressive visual style to it,but the totally uninteresting story is hard to look over.The film is also way overlong,running just short of two hours,especially wrong for a sequel of all things.Another impressive quality could be the effects,but the gore and general violence is not very commendable.On the performances front,Wesley Snipes is a very believable comic book action hero and deserves better material to work with,Kris Kristofferson looks happy to be getting work and Luke Goss is suitably retro 80s band for a film with a slightly 80s look to it.But generally speaking,this is another instance when,in a year already filled to the brim with tacky,made to order sequels,style has gone over substance.**",Null,0,1,1 October 2002
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Revives the musical
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) was a simple barber with a pretty wife and infant daughter, until the corrupt Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) had him unfairly locked away so he could force his wife to be with him against her will. Years later, Benjamin returns to London but with a new name- Sweeney Todd- and with one thing on his mind: revenge. He makes friends with pie shop owner Mrs Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter) and, after missing his chance for revenge against Turpin, decides to take his anger and vengeance out on the ordinary inhabitants of London, slitting their throats so Mrs Lovett can use them to make meat pies.The musical has been a genre that's faded away over the years, much like the western or the murder mystery. But director Tim Burton has reunited with frequent star of his films, Johnny Depp, to make a film version of the popular stage play. And it has his unmistakable style stamped all over it. This is no Rogers and Hammerstein, everything's jolly, la la la musical from the old days, but a raw, savage, blood-splattered film that would shock fans of those types of films away. Not so much The Sound of Music as The Sound of Throat-gurgling! It's Burton's darkest film to date and he handles it very well indeed.Watching the film, you're reminded what a unique and pleasant experience the musical can be, for a type of film that isn't about much nowadays, as the frequent musical numbers do sweep you away and wrap you up in the film quite wonderfully. Even more impressive when you think that all the cast, including Depp, Carter and Rickman, all did their own singing. It's not so much their performances that roll the film along here as their singing, which is certainly more likable. The story's pretty decent, too, showing an unflinching 18th century London with corruption and moral decadence everywhere, as well as exploring how one man's endless quest for revenge warps his mind and causes him to lose his soul.The 18 certificate didn't come for nothing, and when the throat-slitting scenes come about they don't spare anything, all the blood squirting and spraying out the slit throats in a manner as gross as you could imagine. This may be too much for some faint-hearted viewers, but it could just as easily be a recommendation to others. At any rate, this is well worth checking out as a sterling re-introduction to a genre that's fallen to the sidelines pretty much altogether over the years. *****",10,0,1,7 February 2008
Horrible Bosses," An original idea for a comedy that works for the most part
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Nick (Jason Bateman) has his heart set on promotion at work, but finds his psychotic boss Mr. Harken (Kevin Spacey) has taken it for himself, and leaves him in no uncertain terms he'll make his life hell if he kicks up any trouble. Things aren't much better for his friend Dale (Charlie Day) who's being sexually harassed by his boss (Jennifer Aniston) who's able to manipulate him at her whim. And the same goes for Kenny (PJ Byrne) who's forced to contend with his new boss, the crass, moronic son of the guy he used to work for. Altogether, these guys conspire to make their lives better and kill the bosses who are making their lives so unbearable. Needless to say, they have trouble pulling this off...If there's one thing a lot of people can relate to more than anything at the moment, especially in a day and age where a poor and uncertain economic climate is forcing them to stay in jobs they can no longer bear, it's hating their bosses, especially if they're completely unbearable people. So director Seth Gordon has an inspired concept at hand with this tale of a group of men who're driven to try and make them pay the ultimate price. Of course, being a film and with the primary purpose of providing entertainment value, these boss characters are exaggerated caricatures (the slave driver, the ball buster etc.) and this is the type of comedy film that's been doing the rounds a lot lately, with the typical sort of gross out, facile humour that modern audiences love (including 'Hornblower' star Ioan Gruffold as a man who offers a very particular (but unclear) service over the internet) that is consistent, but gets lost over the course of a wavey plot that meanders and loses it's flow a little, leaving the experience not quite the sum of it's parts.Cast wise, Spacey surprises as the funniest, another ability to his dramatic range, while as HB No. 2, Aniston turns what should be every guy's fantasy into a warped nightmare. Colin Farrell can do comedy, as In Bruges proved, but his screen time here is a bit limited and he isn't really given enough time and material to make the most of his character. With regards the three put upon protagonists, the set up is almost identical to The Hangover, with three unknowns playing the leads who most of the comedic escapades hang on, and while the results aren't quite as successful, Horrible Bosses is still more than a good laugh and a really clever idea. ***",Null,0,0,31 July 2011
Black Mass," Too well made to be bad, but sadly far from the sum of it's parts
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The true story of James 'Whitey' Bulger, who, in 1970s Boston, quickly rose through the ranks to become the most feared gangster on the scene...with some assistance from the FBI. Bulger's Winter Hill mob are claiming their territory, much to the annoyance of their rivals, who are sure to have them wiped out. But FBI Agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton), who grew up on the same streets as Bulger and his lawyer brother Billy (Benedict Cumberbatch), but took a rapidly different path, spots a chance to take care of Bulger's adversaries for him, by having him become an FBI informant. However, he underestimates the man's capacity for acquiring power, and before long finds his world crumbling down around him.It would seem rival gangsters controlling various territories in towns and cities across America was pretty much par for the course for most of the twentieth century, if the depiction on numerous films is to be believed, but the ones that make for the best viewing are the ones that make fact seem stranger than fiction. Out of the Furnace director Scott Cooper has dug this promising but not entirely delivering offering out of the mire. Introducing us to a character in the world we've probably never heard of, but whose exploits were so fantastical it's amazing we didn't, it's too well made to be absolutely awful, but it's faults still make it well less than the sum of its parts.While many haven't raved about the film, they have had a lot of praise for Depp's lead performance, but personally I felt it lacked true conviction, and failed to really unnerve me or come off as cold or calculated as Denzel Washington in American Gangster, or even Michael Shannon in The Iceman. It maybe got a little chillier toward the end, after he's killed a ridiculous amount of people, but on the whole nothing that great, despite the impressive lizard face transformation. A bit more impressive is actually Cumberbatch, who just owns his role a little more and manages a fine Boston accent, while Rick Astley alike Edgerton functions fine as the guy on the right side of the law.The film has an interesting and complex story to tell, but in all honesty it tries to cram too much in, and it ends up becoming laborious, poorly paced and, as a result, unengaging. While its fine points cannot be ignored, it comes off as a serviceable film rather than a great one. ***",7,0,0,3 December 2015
The Town," Solid, compelling thriller that further solidifies Affleck as a director to be reckoned with
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Doug Macray (Ben Affleck) is one of a group of career criminals who plan and carry out bank robberies in the Charlestown area of Boston. On the latest heist, bank worker Claire (Rebecca Hall) is taken hostage and released under no uncertain terms that her life will be over if she talks to the cops. But with FBI Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) on their trail, Doug finds himself, as the most level headed and compassionate of the group, forced to work his way into Claire's life to keep tabs on her, especially when it emerges she identified a tattoo on the back of the neck of James (Jeremy Renner), a more aggressive and ruthless member of the group. As Frawley intensifies his chase, and the truth looks set to come out, Doug must work to stop everything exploding into hell around him.Action is a genre that's started to feel especially generic and interchangeable in recent years, bereft of a lot of the inspiration and colour it enjoyed in it's halycon days of the 70s and, certainly, the 80s. It's high time something came by that resembled the days when it truly felt like an event, like something really thorough and satisfying. And even better that the emphasis isn't all on the big explosions and shoot outs, but with more than a dash of human dynamics thrown in, which gives the story that bit more edge and verve and makes you care about it and the characters that bit more. Ben Affleck's second directorial effort after the amazing Gone Baby Gone manages this, as well as further cementing him as a new directing talent to be reckoned with, competent and compelling, able to tell a brilliant story and charge it with enough emotion to make you stick with it to the end. It could certainly be argued he is a much better director than he is an actor.Affleck, Hall, Renner and Hamm are the main players of the story, and it certainly helps that they are all on electrifying form, but even better that they have such a strong supporting cast in the shape of Balke Lively, Chris Cooper and, in what may have been his last role, the late Pete Postlethwaite, fierce and powerful as ever, but admittently looking rather pale and gaunt, on account of his deteriorating condition. Still, if it was the case, this is certainly a fitting swansong to head out on, one cog in part of a very well built machine. ****",9,0,0,5 July 2011
Suicide Squad," Flashy but lifeless DC Comics adaptation
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The Earth is under attack from an intergalactic life force that wants to take over. Government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) suggests an unlikely idea: to battle with such a deadly and unfair force, they must assemble a team of super villains who play by their own rules, including assassin Deadshot (Will Smith), super minx Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and her lover The Joker (Jared Leto), and release them from prison to take down the threat. This, of course, does not go entirely to plan, and as well as dealing with the force, they must also rescue Doctor Jane Moone (Cara Delevinge) from the clutches of the Enchantress, an evil entity that has taken over her.While Marvel certainly seems to hold the reigns over the superhero movie franchise, DC Comics are more than capable of flashing their weight, with a number of glossy big screen adaptations of their most popular characters, where their virtuous, emboldened personas are projected into the product to heightened effect. With Suicide Squad, director David Ayer has attempted to flip this on its head, and instead give us a group of anti heroes with attitude and much less moral fibre. It's definitely a colourful, flashy piece, but sadly, the end result is just a complete mess.It's going for a loud, funky style, yet it's shot in a surprisingly grey and dour manner throughout, like it's trying to capture the spirit of the righteous comic book adaptations it was selling itself as the antidote to. Yet the worst thing is just the complete lack of any discernible, coherent plot to keep you interested. The complete premise seems to be sold on what would happen if a bunch of bad guys were sent to battle a super-threat, but this is not a strong enough foundation on which to set up a film in itself, and it shows.Performances wise, Smith virtually plays the wise-cracking wise-ass in his sleep, yet he still feels unsuited and misplaced playing an all out villain as opposed to just a maverick good guy, while as one of the main villains, Delevinge is just a terrible actress and should really just go back to the catwalk. Leto's Joker is certainly different, but not much of an impression otherwise. Robbie's sassy Harley Quinn is probably the best thing about it.Just a big, colourful, garish mess, really, and a wasted opportunity. *",2,0,0,1 June 2017
Shutter Island," Decent atmosphere, but hardly Scorsese's best film or Lahane's best adaptation
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning It's 1954, and Federal Agents Teddy Daniels (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) have been sent to the titular island mental institution to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a female serial child killer. It's made very clear from the off set that they may do their job, but they are not in charge and must co-operate with the warden and the guards on the island. As slow progress is made, Daniels and Aule start to conjure up wild conspiracy theories to what is going on on the island and their real reason for being sent there. Things aren't helped when the chief doctors on the island Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max von Sydow) aren't being very forthcoming, and the pair are left further to their own devices. But as Daniels suffers flashbacks to his time in the war liberating a Nazi concentration camp and his perception of reality becomes blurred, everything starts to become less clear and everything looks set to become not how it seems.Martin Scorsese has returned with a film that is an unusual branch out from his usual gangster movie schtick, and is a fresh approach for him to experiment with. It's also another adaptation of a novel by Dennis Lahane, after the superb Gone Baby Gone and the very watchable Mystic River. But while Shutter Island is a very well made and tense film, somehow for me it just didn't match up to the quality of those last two films.This plays as a very long and drawn out, what typically gets called nowadays a 'mind f*ck' film, showing a lead character becoming increasingly claustrophobic and isolated, and being pushed to question his own sanity in the light of increasing evidence everything is not how he sees it. It's not afraid to push boundaries, showing the blood splattered bodies of murdered children, for instance, even harder to fathom for a 15 certificate film. Typical of Lahane's work, it's unflinching and goes straight for the jugular, unafraid to delve into the darker side of human nature and playing for a more mature audience. And there is a complex and carefully structured mystery to fathom through out that you have to pay attention to. Yet somehow it just feels really hard to get in to, and all feels a little too much to take in at once. It feels like one of Lahane's more ambitious works and it works having an expert like Scorsese on hand to oversee things, but somehow their respective styles clash, the tone feeling less riveting and more plodding. There is a tense and decent score, which drives a lot of it and gives certain scenes a more dynamic edge, but it all just fails to come together as a whole.Performances wise, Di Caprio is suitably intense and unrestrained in the lead role, as a man being pushed over the edge, with sturdy support from Ruffalo. Meanwhile, Kingsley and von Sydow are a well cast double act as the educated but dodgy main doctors, and there's a lively supporting cast in the shape of Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas and Patricia Clarkson.Shutter Island has worked with some and been a more average affair with others. Like a lot of films nowadays, it may be a 'need to see it twice' affair, but personally Scorsese's last film The Departed really showed his flair a lot more successfully to a 21st century audience. ***",7,1,4,8 April 2010
Doctor Strange," Has all the right ingredients, but fails to cook a tasty recipe
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In this latest Marvel adaptation, brilliant but arrogant surgeon Dr Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is involved in a car crash, and loses the senses in his hands. In order to find out the secret behind his recovery, he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, where he meets The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor.) Whereas the Avengers fight their enemies with force, this is a group that harnesses their inner power beyond the mortal world, in order to defeat Kaerilius (Mads Mikkelson) and stop his plan to destroy the natural world and its order.The latest origin story in the Marvel juggernaut stands alone, and marks a shift in approach to the traditional superhero persona. While it's as laden with dazzling visual effects and set pieces as the usual fare, DS seems to revolve around a more cerebral bend than the smash and bash antics of Spider-Man, Iron Man and the like. Strange is a character in his own right, on his own mission, and who better than current man of the moment Cumberbatch to play him, which he does very well, embodying the lead character in every inch as, reliably, do co stars Swinton and Ejiofor.As entertaining as they are, too many of these superhero films nowadays get weighed down in endless back story, dragging proceedings on for longer than they really need to, especially the 'origin' stories. So it's to the films credit that it's nice and short, delivering the goods without over-whelming the audience. Like the best of them, it also has a neat sense of humour and keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek. The special effects and action sequences are also amazing, dazzling and colourful. The problem is, the story just isn't interesting or compelling enough, and it's impossible to care about the characters or their motivations enough to get engaged with it. And that, sadly, is a big problem.The end impression you take away from the film is one of pity. It has everything fundamentally going right for it, it's just what's on the surface that lets it down. Maybe they'll get it right with the next film. **",4,3,6,23 July 2017
Interstellar," A once promising director assaults his audience with a seemingly never-ending barrage of bafflement
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the future, Earth has become a pretty sad, desolate place, where resources have run scarce and machines have taken over much. A space time continuum in outer space is discovered, around the planet of Saturn, that humanity can ascend to in order to begin a new life away from the rapidly diminishing Earth. Cooper (a continually, frustratingly mumbling Matthew McConaughey) a simple farmer, is chosen to man the space craft that will save Earth, along with co pilots Romilly (David Gyasi) and Brand (Anne Hathaway) and a talking robot thing that looks like a fridge, by the name of TARS (Bill Irwin.) But as the mission unfolds, they discover secrets and lies that threaten to plunge them into conflict amongst each other, I guess. They're possibly meant to do something else, and something else happens, but by the end (which, given the length, I'm surprised I stuck around till), the whole film had just so gone over my head I might have missed it.At the start of the new century, a young, promising director called Christopher Nolan emerged, an eager and hungry young mind that delivered Memento, an intelligent and original thriller that took a far flung concept and played with your mind and demanded your full attention to the end. He followed this with Insomnia, not only one of my all time favourite thrillers, but also one of my favourite films, that I still love to this day. After these two relatively independent offerings, he established himself as one of the top new names, and possibly Hollywood was happy to throw a lot of cash at him, and let him run wild and indulge his darkest, most inner most relentless cerebral musings, and from here on in, he went and delivered increasingly lengthy productions that bombarded the minds of his audience with so much anomaly and detail, even turning Batman into a challenging and complex ride three times. Even his comparatively short 2006 effort The Prestige seemed lost in it's own mystery and aggrandisement. But with Interstellar, he's just completely surpassed himself.Clocking up at nearly three hours, the film, in the time you spend with it (and you really do have to make quite a commitment) truly rakes up every last second of it's stated running time, and that would mean there's a lot to be taken in, and much you might have to describe and re-live about it afterwards. It could be quite difficult, but actually you can sum the film Interstellar up with one word: over. It's over ambitious, over indulgent, over bloody long!, over bearing, over cerebral over complicated and, just over whelming. And by the end, after grudging with it for so long, you'll be glad it's 'over.' Seriously, if you manage to get through it with out getting up to stretch your legs at least once while it's still on, you should get a telegram from the queen! I can't believe it took me so long to see it, but I'm certainly glad I missed it in the cinema.An intelligent concept is fine, but it can't give the audience no room to breathe like this. It's a shame, because if Nolan had delivered something a little more condensed, the intricate plot the film had to explore and any intelligent message it had to deliver could have been better absorbed by the viewer, instead of being lost in a sea of bafflement. Sadly, the best praise I can end up giving it is some fabulous cinematography, in space and at sea that sticks in the mind.Inception was too much, really, but I took it as the most intellectual film ever made and kind of have a soft spot for it, but this is just too much. Nolan can be thankful his films haven['t lost their spark and edge like fellow contemporary M Night Shyamalan, but he really needs to stop being so ruthlessly anti-mainstream and pelting his audience with such lengthy, cerebral exposition, or he might lose them forever. And stop least stop making them so dour and humourless to boot. In terms of a modern, space bound adventure, it goes without saying Alfonso Couran's much trimmer Gravity does a better job of being smart and in orbit. **",4,7,13,6 September 2015
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Martin McDonagh strikes another hit with this quirky, off-beat drama
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the small, mid-western town of Ebbing, Missouri, the daughter of Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) has been raped and murdered, and months have passed without any suspect being caught. In an act of desperation, she hires three large billboards leading into the town to put up some messages to embarrass the town's cancer stricken chief of police Willoughby (Woody Harrelson) into action. However, Mildred's actions come to have a far higher effect on more people than merely Willoughby, not least the volatile Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell), and a host of others who prove less than sympathetic to her plight...Ten years on, and Martin McDonagh's Belgian set comedy thriller In Bruges still remains one of the most memorable films of the last decade or so, with its witty, sharp dialogue and excruciating political incorrectness. And yet since then, this film proves only the second directorial feature he's made, a steady drip stream of work that even Quentin Tarantino would struggle to topple. His name is far less likely to seep into the cultural consciousness as that man's did, but when he pens a quality script, he hits a zinger, as this very impressive piece of work is further prove of.McDonagh has selected a seasoned cast list of mature performers that are unlikely to appeal to the general target demographic of cinema goers, but will certainly whet the beaks of the more mature film-goers, and each one of them, including McDormand, Harrelson and Rockwell, is perfectly suited to their role and deliver fine performances. It's McDonagh's distinctive style that drives the film, though, able as he is to take such a dark, tragic plotline and give it such a darkly humorous edge, whilst never losing the emotionally charged dramatic under-current that keeps it all flowing.He's certainly quite a shy, occasional director, but if McDonagh can consistently produce this kind of quality work, it's a shame that he doesn't pop his head out more often. ****",9,1,1,11 June 2018
American Sniper," Compertently made, but overly simplistic of a complicated and emotive set up
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As we open on Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) on the battleground in Iraq, we see him faced with the most unenviable of dilemmas: his target sight's set on a young child, who's been handed an explosive device, which is to be thrown at his comrades. Will he pull the trigger? Before we can find out, we are thrown in to reverse gear, as we learn of Kyle before he signed up and became the solider with reportedly the highest number of confirmed kills ever, through to the severe PTSD he developed after several tours of duty.While enjoying a film career with a fine and varied back catalogue, Mr. Clint Eastwood has never been one to steer too far in to the murky waters of controversy, which has sadly befallen him with American Sniper, one of many inevitable biopics revolving around the Iraq war, and the tense political climate that followed. Certain segments of the media and society have accused it of war glorification and a celebration of American imperialism. The politics are pretty much set in stone beforehand either way, but this is undoubtedly an overly simplistic and under developed film that, for it's basic competence and technical flair, fails to really get under the meat and bones of itself.It plays, as it does, as an examination of one subject, a deeply flawed and morally questionable man, who despite showing bravery and dedication in going to Iraq and protecting his comrades, evidence has shown he thought of the Iraqis in a less than commendable way, even if many were shooting at him and trying to kill him. The film seems to generate controversy from any number of angles, and Eastwood has applied a deft approach to this real life killing machine, right up to the end showdown with the Olympian Iraqi sniper, resulting in a fastest finger first dual ('you feelin' lucky? Well, do ya, punk?') For quite a huge downside, there's a fairly high upside, too. Cooper was enthusiastic for the lead role, and he fits it quite well, managing Kyle's gravelly Texas accent and mannerisms, and gliding through all the dramatic elements of the film. Eastwood thoroughly pores over all of Kyle's post war life, and his lack of stability as a civilian, in public and in private. It's the sort of thing he's known for, and despite some hiccups, he still does it well. ***",7,3,13,3 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A major disappointment
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsAOTC is way inferior to The Phantom Menace.The first film in the new series was hardly anything to rival the classic Sci-Fi movies of the late 1970s and early 1980s,but compared to this labourious,droning dud,it doesn't seem so bad after all.Lets begin with the plot (what there is of it) which drags on forever and has no real coherent structure to follow.Too much is attempted to be established too early on,and it becomes information overload.Nevertheless,this is a Summer blockbuster and plot was never considered an essential ingredient in these ever.So,with all the on screen talent involved,you'd expect the acting to be great.But sadly,no.Everyone involved turns in blank,unemoting performances.But to be fair to them,so would anyone working with a script as dull and cliched as this.And all who act in it,including Samuel L. Jackson,Ewan McGregor,Natalie Portman and Christopher Lee,are barely seen on screen for longer than a few moments,leaving not enough time to establish them and relate to them.We learn more about each of them individually towards the end,but the ending drags on so much that all the individual twists and information they try to cram in becomes too much,and you're just screaming for them to leave it till Episode 3 already.This is really proof positive that a film can have all the brilliant special effects in the world,but if the story sucks,the audience will become nauseated.**",Null,2,5,8 June 2002
Gone Baby Gone," One of the most well made and satisfying thrillers I've seen in ages

But they're about to get their big break when the family of a missing little girl hire them to find her. But they encounter some negative vibes off police captain Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) with his own tragic history with his own child who views them as amateurs and the two heavy handed cops assigned to the case, Detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) who they are lead to form an uneasy relationship with. Although the family appear distraught, the little girl's home life is revealed to be no bed of roses, with her coke addicted mother Helene (Amy Ryan) and shady relatives. Eventually it appears to have been solved, only for events to take a sinister turn and for things to turn out in a way no one could have expected.This arrived pretty much out of nowhere for me, and is probably one I wouldn't have bothered with if I hadn't become aware of the plot line and the rave reviews it had received. It turns out it was actually held back due to it's parallels with the Madeleine McCann case and indeed, as a film it does eerily resemble the case, both in the little girl's resemblance to Madeleine and the theme of the home life of her family turning out to be rather undesirable and some scabby family members trying to milk cash out of it. I often tend to disagree with critics who give a lot of films the five star treatment, but they were spot on here as Ben Affleck has proved a better director than actor and has crafted a fittingly bleak, edgy, gritty and exciting thriller full of unexpected twists and turns that keep you hooked right to the end.With his younger brother in the lead role, we are presented a raw, unflinching film that isn't afraid to show the grimy reality of undesirables living in run down, poor, drug addled areas and the depravity in the trail of child abduction cases. Just when it looks like it's wrapping up and the film's over, but you're sitting there thinking that's ended rather quickly, the film pulls the trick a couple more times until the film gets it's real ending that pays off in a way you couldn't have expected it to.With such a credited cast list, it's no surprise that some great performances help keep the film afloat, especially the reliably great Freeman and Harris, an actor I could always take or leave before but who here really gives his role as a tough, unflinching cop a vitality and edge that makes him stand out.Listen to the reviews this time (especially mine!) as this is one of the most well made and satisfying thrillers you'll have seen in a long time. *****",10,0,0,14 June 2008
Ant-Man," Doesn't do better than when it starts, but still one of the better comic book films
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has just got out of jail, and seems consigned to a life of low rent living and even lower paid jobs. Down on his luck and depressed, he agrees to take on one more big time raid. But he doesn't know that this time, the potential victim is in on the act. For Scott is to rob the home of Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a brilliant scientist who retired from public life many years ago after his serum, which has the ability to shrink living subjects to the size of an ant, was misused by the company he worked for. Now, Dr Pym needs Scott to don the suit he designed and stop the diabolical Cross (Corey Stall) from wrecking hell.There has been some kickback lately, what with the sheer onslaught of superhero films that are battering our screens, with even seasoned fans of the genre complaining of the 'infantilism' they are forging on people's minds. But they won't prove to be unpopular anytime soon, if things at the moment are anything to go by, and such it's a case of dividing the good ones from the bad ones. Ant-Man, another lesser known addition from the backlog of Marvel Comics, manages to score more hits than misses, and is for the most part a rollicking, crowd pleasing thrill ride that gets the tone just right, even if it doesn't quite know how to guide it.With a director whose background appears to be more in comedy territory, the tone is never over laborious, and keeps the tongue in cheek spirit of the Avengers franchise in check. Admirably, the film establishes a proper asset up before getting in to the action, really taking time to develop the two main characters before charging in to the action. Sadly, once their paths cross, this doesn't last, and it loses it's sense of coherence a bit. By the end, it feels like it's been going on a little past it's two hour running time. Nevertheless, the film delivers where it's supposed to, the awesome, crowd pleasing set pieces, notably a grimy bathtub being turned into a spacious amphitheatre, people's feet needing to be dodged for dear life, and, more towards the end, a giant Thomas the Tank Engine coming to be discarded on a lawn! Plus there's the novelty of watching a man shrunk in to a grimy pulp, then casually flushed down a toilet (what other film can say that?) It's neither as great as a lot of people say it is, or as bad as a few people say it is, but it's still a superior comic book film, that ticks all the right boxes and promises a fun filled ride. ***",7,0,8,2 August 2015
Bridget Jones's Diary," Here's another transatlantic success
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsWith the outwardly British Bridget being played by Texan Renee Zellweger,it's not so hard to understand why this comedic vehicle is enjoying similar audience on the other side of the Atlantic as well as it's homeland.Zellweger's accent certainly had to work to impress here ,she manages to cover up her Southern drawl well.However,Bridget Jones's Diary is more of a girl's film than a boy's,who are likely to find it slightly dull.There are some impressively comedic moments that will appeal to both genders,however,and comedy certainly seems to be the genre theme that is in main effect here.The performances are involving,it's especially nice to see Hugh Grant taking a break from his regular nice guy schtick to play a slimy,manipulative bad guy and there's a rarely seen few appearances by Honor Blackman as a company employee.However,for a reputed 90 minutes,the film seems to have a tendancy to meander on,with certain scenes overlapping in their conveyance.Overall though,Sharon Maguire's film is a pleasing addition to the current trend of homegrown successes.***",Null,1,2,15 April 2001
Captain America: The First Avenger," Over ambitious, sprawled out yarn
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Steve Rogers (Chris Evans-a nerdy TV personality over here) is a scrawny, unmasculine weakling who wants to be big and strong so he can fight for his country in the Second World War. His prayers appear to be answered when a German scientist (Stanley Tucci) invites him to be his guinea pig on a new serum that induces super strength, which proves successful and he becomes Captain America, a force for good and strength during America's dark days. But he faces his greatest nemesis in the shape of Captain Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) a mad Nazi who plots to mis-use the serum and even becomes his even more twisted alter ego, Red Skull.Superhero movies are a pretty reliable and consistent money spinner for the studios, with a pretty loyal, solid fan base who can always be relied on to pack the theatres out on opening weekends and get the box office coffers spinning. It would take some pretty lousy reviews and test screenings to have a really big impact on their chances in these regards, and Joe Johnston's latest, big budget effects bonanza would appear to have escaped this fate. But if more of the reviewers had been like me, maybe that wouldn't have been the case.The superhero genre is still a fairly successful, winning one that churns out a lot of successes and still has a lot of potential, but while Captain America might have generally won favour with the audiences and critics, I found it to be an over ambitious, over long and over blown misfire, which appears to have ended at least three times but carries on, dragging the story on and playing out in a mispaced style, the end effect of which is just one big bore that all the big action set pieces and effects in the world can't put right.Performances wise, Evans makes for a fairly standard, unmemorable hero, while the best thing is probably Weaving as the villain, doing his usual steely eyed, uncompassionate thing to the best effect he can. Tommy Lee Jones in a supporting role is as reliable as ever, but hardly has the best material to work with and doesn't get the best screen time. Samuel L. Jackson makes a cameo appearance at the end, by which time his appearance feels as desperate as the movies become.It seems an inevitability that a sequel will emerge in a couple of years or so, bigger, better and maybe with a different director. And maybe I'll think it's better. I hope it couldn't be worse than this. **",4,1,2,20 March 2012
American Hustle," Nearly drowns in style to start with, but does develop into something more solid
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIrving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a small time crook who grew up taking a few hard knocks, who finds a kindred spirit and partner in Sydney (Amy Adams) and together they mastermind powerful and elaborate swindles in high stakes situations. But they push their luck too far and undercover agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) busts them. To save their skin, they must help him spring a trap on seemingly wholesome Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) who DiMaso is convinced is dirty. But as Irving and the mayor come to form a more intimate friendship, loyalties and boundaries get pushed that little bit further.The 'American' dream always begs to be scrutinized by film makers, who start the titles of their films with the word 'American', implying their desire to scratch beneath the surface and show up the, potentially quite ugly, side to certain aspects of the culture and lifestyle. Here, director David O'Russell takes us back in time to the '70s, colourfully and stylistically bringing the fashion, music and setting back to life to have a stab at the love of the almighty dollar and the drive for material wealth. Yet it's a film that almost doesn't want to be taken quite so seriously, aiming to tell a straight forward, quirky heist tale, if only such strong writing, good acting and all round higher ambitions weren't getting in it's way.You come to make this assessment as to start with, the film almost seems to get carried away in style, drowning in all the modern flashy, slo-mo tricks any modern day cinema goer would be familiar with, matched by a brilliant '70s soundtrack. But the writing's nowhere near as lazy, and a bit of patience would make way for an intelligent and gripping story, a slow burning narrative that develops in to something fabulous. And if the story is multi-layered and pleasantly surprising, the performances are even better. In the lead role, Bale is a revelation as a dishonest lowlife with an unquenchable spark of humanity burning beneath the surface, but the supporting cast are among the most inspiring, notably Renner as the public spirited politician people just aren't willing to accept breaks the mold in decency, and Jennifer Lawrence as Bale's neurotic ex wife who throws a big spanner in the works as the plot gets under way.This is the sort of thing that can't be pulled off wrong, and O' Russell and his writers have ensured a tale that is solid, enthralling and revelatory. ****",9,1,3,6 February 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Ummmmmmmmmmm-wah!!! Brilliance!!!!
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs This companion piece to the original Godfather film charts the rise of a young Don Vito (Robert De Niro) as well as the ascension of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in the 1950s.Whereas the original just told a straight-out story, this one juxtaposes (brilliantly) two extraordinary tales of the mafia together, from Vito's struggle to over-come an arsehole Don to cement his own position of influence in his Italian-American neighbourhood he occupies to Michael's ascension to power, the personal sacrifices power requires and his testimony before a grand jury of unlawful conduct.People often mention how it was a shock that De Niro and Pacino would have to wait many years before they worked directly together again in Heat, but it's like they're controlling two completely separate movies here (it certainly makes the time fly by quicker if you think of it that way.) Nino Rota's powerful score flies over as absorbingly as it did in the original.Overall,this is even more an accomplished piece of film-making than the original and a must-see if you want to see the ultimate conclusion to that.*****",10,2,6,21 May 2005
The Bourne Ultimatum," Nothing really new to see but fans of the series will know what to expect
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Following on from where the last film left off, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) continues to play cat and mouse with those who are tracking him down, desperately struggling to stay one step ahead of them and trying to get his memory back in a build-up to an explosive revenge at the end.The reviews had been touting this as the best in the series yet but to be honest I couldn't tell much difference between this and the other two, really. United 93 director Paul Greengrass is on hand for directing duties but his hand-held camera style of shooting is better suited to the docu-drama movies he makes rather than big screen adventures like this.One thing the film doesn't focus too much on is plot, bursting straight into the action movie element and flitting wildly between places, from Russia, to France, to London, to Spain and then onto Morrocco.To be fair, it would probably be better if you'd read the books first, but fans of the series probably won't find anything to complain with in the final film, which has proved a fine franchise and which Damon has firmly stamped his mark on as his own. ***",7,2,4,28 August 2007
Nightcrawler," Original, distinctive drama thriller, ambitious in everything it sets out to do
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a mysterious, lonely oddball, who is trawling the streets of LA looking for a job. One night, he chances on a highway accident, and is struck by cameraman Joe (Bill Paxton) and his determination to be right at the scene for his local news channel. After obtaining his own equipment, he shoots some footage of his own, and brings it to the attention of station head Nina (Rene Russo), who comes to be impressed with his style. But as he becomes more deeply drawn to his new activity, he crosses more and more blurred lines and becomes desperate for the best.While most films are driven by an intriguing plot and a cohesive narrative of some kind, there are sometimes those that are motivated by a central performance, or as a character study of a certain individual. Intended as a satire of the twenty four hour news culture, and of the ruthless determination to succeed in that world, debut director Dan Gilroy, who at the age of fifty five at least has a lot of writing credits to his name, has given us in Nightcrawler Gyllenhaal's Bloom, a fictional character set against the backdrop of this modern world. Channeling a method style in the vein of Robert De Niro, he creates a character with a mysterious background, who has something smouldering beneath him that begs to be unravelled. He's a socially awkward and unaware man who doesn't come off as a normal person in any way, and at certain points, like when standing in front of a bathroom mirror, suddenly unleashes a roar of insanity.Although awkward, he is charismatic and hooks the viewer and the people around him in with this magnetic web. These people create some fine supporting characters, including Paxton's rival 'nightcrawler', who goes from being disinterested to frustratedly desperate to work with our anti-hero, as well as Brit Riz Ahmed, managing a fine American accent as Bloom's hungry but naïve co-worker, and Russo's station controller, who proves only marginally less hungry for infamy as our lead boy. But above everyone else, this is destined to be one of Gyllenhaal's defining roles, in a film centred around him and driven by his character's mesmerizing personal quest. In the first film he's directed, much like the film itself, Gilroy coats the whole thing in more of an intriguing style and veneer than anything else, but it doesn't make it any less dynamic or original.It would have been nice for more layers of this edgy and mysterious character to have been revealed, especially since the film is so centred on him, but Gilroy has still achieved something quite funky and new. ****",9,2,4,2 September 2015
The Aviator," Better than I thought and an unsurprising Oscar contender
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs A film chronicling the first year in the life of Howard Hughes,the aviation expert and movie mogul from the 1920s to 1940s period of his life.What surprised me more than anything about the film was the surprisingly commanding lead performance from Leonardo Di Caprio,who delivers a very good portrayal of the arrogant,domineering,self-absorbed and increasingly freakishly eccentric Hughes,working his way through two relationships to women he never really loved and working his way through an assortment of other arm candy for use at film premieres and so-on yet his real passion lay almost autisticly in flying.Di Caprio has good support in the shape of Alec Baldwin as the head of his rival air company Pan Am Airlines,Kate Blanchett as his first girlfriend,actress Katie Hepburn,and Kate Beckinsale as his second girlfriend,movie actress Ava Gardner.That's not to mention a cameo from Jude Law (surprisingly good for once!) as movie heart-throb Eeroyl Flynn (it says a lot that the best thing I've seen him in so far has seen him with screen-time of just about a minute!)Yet as good as they are,it is simply Di Caprio who carries the film.He deserves to win the Oscar.The film is also served well by a good script,with nice dialogue.But it's weakness is probably the story,which lacks coherence slightly,Nevertheless,it's a very good film,very well made and very deserving to win at the Oscars.*****",Null,0,0,6 February 2005
Oblivion," Dull, meandering sci-fi dud
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNearly a hundred years in to the future, Earth has been shattered by an invading army from the skies, and has become a desolate wasteland. In this barren landscape, Jack (Tom Cruise) is one of the few remaining 'drone' operators, who is dispatched from his remote station by his co- worker Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) to complete missions. But he is having recurring dreams about Earth and the life he once lived there, which he shares with a mysterious woman named Julia (Olga Kurylenko.) When he comes in to contact with this woman in real life, he is thrown in to a desperate identity crisis where he meets the leader of the invaders, Beech (Morgan Freeman) and the shocking truth of the matter.Opening to decidedly average reviews, Oblivion was another one I forewent at the cinema, in spite of it probably being a film that would have been better suited there. Indeed, sweeping, majestic visuals and cinematography are probably it's main recommendations, for what is other-wise a slow, uninvolving and meandering trip in to nowhere, that fails to draw you in or go anywhere that your average post-apocalyptic action thriller already hasn't. With a plot that features only a few main characters, it really needed a story with some meat and bones on it to keep you interested, and sadly it just doesn't, boring and aimless as it is. It's such a shame so much effort went in to lavish production design and rollicking action sequences, and not as much as in to anything to subsidize it.Cruise, it would seem, remains the go to guy for this kind of big budget, spectacular folly, and as long as it's got a star with his kind of name power on it, it's guaranteed to draw in at least some revenue at the box office. I don't know if it was a hit or a flop, but the reviews would seem to take the wind out of it's sails enough to hint at something probably roughly in between. It's the box office where you have to hit the makers of this kind of movie, because artistically it can take all the flak you can throw at it, but if enough fickle, superficial movie goers go and see it, an even lamer sequel will undoubtedly follow, and go some way to showing them they can get away with it.In title and in deed, Oblivion is better suited as a theme park ride than a film. Maybe it would have been better if it was based on it. **",4,2,4,12 December 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Stirring musical biopic, accessible to Queen fans or not
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs a young man whose family emigrated from Tasmania, living in 1970s England, Freddie Mercury (Remi Malek) struggled to find his place in society, or get any kind of acceptance. But he had a magnifying persona that couldn't be shaken off, and was destined for greatness. Together with fellow musicians Brian May (Gwilym Lee), John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello) and Roger Taylor (Ben Hardy), he formed Queen, a rock band that would set the benchmark for others to follow. Defying convention, Mercury and his band enjoyed fantastic success that has resonated to this day, even whilst his personal life descended into anarchy and despair, before his tragic early death from AIDs.As a member of the 'millennial' generation (but just barely!), it's a sad fact that most of the bands and music that set the standard for what was to follow, and have stood the test of time today, were about before my time, and so I couldn't experience first hand the massive cultural impact they had when they first emerged. It's sadly the truth that most of what we've experienced was gathering the crumbs from under the table of what went before. I've always been aware of Queen, and never disliked any of their music, but they were never able to play a big part of my formative years. But this stirring biopic from Bryan Singer (mostly known for making X-Men films!) magnifies their musical genius and innovation into something that makes everything else feel redundant.It's telling that it all feels like less of a biopic of Queen the band, than of Freddie Mercury the individual, with May et al only getting brief screen time in the background. It was his life, and all too soon death, that gave Queen that magnifying allure, in a time before twenty four hour celebrity culture (and STD awareness only just breaking through.) Despite his obviously wild excesses, it's commendable of Singer that he's managed to portray them in a restrained way, giving the film a more encompassing 12 certificate. And all the more good that Malek's lead performance is so mesmerising, drawing you in like a magnet.Geniuses cure medicines, invent devices, and write ground-breaking music, and Freddie Mercury was definitely one such tortured soul who did just that. If you weren't able to grow up with Queen, then this incredible dramatization of their lives will at least give you the experience. ****",9,1,2,27 November 2019
Bird Box," Another pretentious modern horror film, despite all the hype
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMalorie (Sandra Bullock) is an ordinary woman, who's just learned she's pregnant, who is suddenly plunged into a nightmare world of madness and mayhem, when people start suicidally throwing themselves to their doom. After her sister Jessica (Sarah Paulson) falls victim to this madness, she hauls herself into the home of Douglas (John Malkovich), a cynical man mistrustful of everyone, along with a group of other survivors. The story cuts between this and Malorie commandeering two young children to safety in blindfolds...Horror films can't seem to get it right these days. They're either taking the cheap and easy route, overloading on jump scares and loud screeching, or they're trying to be too deep and cerebral, literally jumping from one extreme to another. And in the latter case, it's always at the crux of a really far fetched, far out concept, as is the case with Bird Box, the new Netflix film that seems to have everybody talking. The first thing that springs to mind less than five minutes into it is the recent big screen frightener A Quiet Place, a similarly over the top film that perfectly illustrates what I'm talking about.For all its high concept pretensions though, it soon succumbs to the clichÃ©s all too easily, with a bunch of stereotypical characters all holed up in a remote location, and echoes of other horror fare, such as 28 Days Later..., also pervade. Telling the story in two separate strands, it all pans out too long and comes off as too long winded. Even the performances, from a mostly seasoned supporting cast, don't feel like they're really heartfelt. Even Bullock feels flat and awkward in the first half, although she does come alive a bit in the second.It's all intriguing and diverting enough not to be a complete failure, but you just wish everyone involved had not tried to be so high handed. In the end, what seems to be some kind of Sixth Sense style twist rolls by, but if you can put it together in one go, you're a better man than me. Personally, I'd got to the stage when I just wanted to slap on one of those damn blindfolds myself and relax. **",4,6,11,31 December 2018

He has another problem in the shape of his wife Katie (Tilda Swinton) who's having an affair with Harry (George Clooney) a man he dislikes. Harry meets Linda (Frances McDormand) a gym trainer who's desperate for a man. Unknown to him, she and her work colleague Chad (Brad Pitt) have got their hands on a copy of Osbourne's memoirs...and this plunges them all into a chaotic game of cat and mouse, by turns hilarious and deadly.You know when you're watching a Coen Brothers film. No other directors can match their unique sense of style and atmosphere. And given most of their films have tended to be good rather than bad, this isn't a bad thing. Though their preferred staple genre would appear to be the thriller mould, they have always toyed with elements of humour and absurdity, and Burn After Reading is the first film of theirs that I thought tended to focus more on this than the thriller part. And, like the long list of thrillers they've made before it, it's a genre they've pulled off well.As the main character, Malkovich has to carry the film, and as intense a dramatic actor as he can be, here he is given a springboard to show how funny he can be too. His voice and the way he pronounces words, mixed with the awkward and far out situations he finds himself in here, make for comedy gold. In support, Clooney has aged so his good looks aren't something to fall back on so much, but he's his usual chirpy wise guy persona. Coens regular McDormand gives her all in her role too, and there's decent support from Pitt and Swinton as well.It ends rather abruptly, but by the time it comes, all you're really left wondering is: will the Coens ever make a really 'bad' film? ****",9,3,9,24 March 2009
Watchmen," Ground breaking in many ways, but still makes you hark for old time superhero movies
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning For many years, the 'Watchmen' guarded society and took care of the bad guys, until public opinion turned against them and they vanished from the public eye. Now, in 1985, former frontline member The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is found murdered and the old team start to wonder why. When an even bigger conspiracy to maybe murder more of them is unraveled, former members and some of their off-spring team together to search for the culprit before he strikes again, taking them down a deadly path where people they thought they could trust may turn out to be their deadliest enemies.300 director Zack Snyder's take on the apparently (I don't think I was around when they came out!) hugely successful graphic comic books puts a subversive slant on the comic book genre. This market, almost exclusively aimed at the younger end of the cinema going population (and understandably so) is here given a lengthy, back story trouting treatment, saturated with blood splattered violence, graphic sex and strong language. The fantasy characters, with their masks, capes and costumes can't help but keep the viewer entrenched in the child like world the comic book is aimed at, and getting it such an adult rating is a risky gamble that could backfire as much as it could pay off.Despite running in at nearly three hours and having little in the way of a discernible plot, Watchmen still managed the trick of never keeping me bored or looking at my watch during it. The visuals, special effects and action sequences are fantastic, and by the end you've certainly stuck with it long enough to feel thoroughly immersed in these character's histories, emotions and memoirs. But the film is following a modern trend by deviating away from the main story and taking up a lot of time digging up the history of the main characters to keep us involved in the story at hand, which only ends up serving the exact opposite, weighing the audience down with long winded mouths of dialogue that fail to flow off the tongue properly.Comic book movies, even if they stretched in just over the two hour mark, used to be simple escapist entertainment which required no brain power, mainly for the under twelves who's minds were more suited to the fantasy element. Now they're all trying to be deep and meaningful, with most of the focus on back story and trying to be all clever and cynical at the same time. If they carry on like this, there's a real risk they could alienate some devoted followers who'll feel their market has been violated. ***",7,1,4,24 March 2009

28 Weeks Later," A great sequel, on a par with the original
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The virus that was unleashed in the first film has now wiped out virtually all of London and NATO send in US troops to quarantine the deserted city, keeping the marauding zombies under control and ensuring calm and order amongst the people. Don (Robert Carlyle) has retreated from his hide-out in the country, cowardly leaving his wife behind to die, but returns to the capital city to be re-united with his children Tammy (Imogen Poots) and Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and break the news about their mother to them. But then to his terror, Don learns his wife has survived and is secured in the quarantine camp. Not only that, but she has a rare blood type that is fighting off the virus. When she infects Don with the virus, turning him into a zombie, his kids are left to make their own way to safety, aided by a humanistic American soldier named Doyle (Jeremy Renner) and Sally (Amanda Walker) a doctor who wants to protect Tammy above all else, believing she may hold the cure to the virus.I must admit this sequel to the very enjoyable 2002 Brit chiller 28 Days Later caught me somewhat by surprise, as I had no idea of it being in production or even having been made until a few weeks before it came out. Nevertheless, making a sequel to that great homegrown film has been a surprisingly inspired idea, a film that manages to be just as tense and atmospheric as the original, getting right on a par with it in fact. The over-view of a deserted London is as eerie and unsettling as last time round, with a neat sense of claustrophobia creepily taking over the hustle and bustle usually associated with that city. Only this time round, there's more as an emphasis on the action element as well, a la Aliens, with the gung ho Americans being drafted in to restore order to the decaying city with their tough talk and big guns. Nevertheless, we have a likable character in Doyle, a man of reason and compassion when all his colleagues are pushing their military might around. There's a nice, believable edge to all the characters in fact, from the selfish and cowardly father, to the two kids who become orphans realizing they're all they have together now and so sticking together through thick and thin.With Danny Boyle and a lot of the original production team tied up with the year's earlier Brit mega flick Sunshine, Spanish director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo has taken over here. Although he retains a lot of Boyle's original vision, his camera use during the zombie attacks is a little too shaky and close-up, which is a bit of a hindrance. But what a minor complaint with a film that does what I was convinced it would not do, live right up to the standards of the original and, while not improving on it in any way, matching it's quality right up to a tee. ****",9,5,11,16 May 2007
Cast Away," Product placement running rampant
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsWhen a product or service is blatantly being shown in a movie,the patronism of it is generally going to rile you.Fed-Ex is a relatively new company struggling up off the ground,and trying to get it across to the audience in a major Hollywood Tom Hanks production would seem like the right way to go about attracting a big scale audience.To those unaware of the implementation,it comes and goes,but to those who can see through the cracks ,you are in a position to remind that the trailers were on before the film,not during it.The rest of Cast Away is certainly a film on it's own.It's hauntingly told ,with theme music conspicuously absent throughout it's majority,and Hanks himself not speaking a word, adding to the eerie stillness of it.The start of the plane crash injects a sudden sharp shock to the system,and his tribulations on the island are quite involving.However,for a 12 certificate movie,certain members of the audience shouldn't have had to endure the DIY dentistry scene involving the ice skate,and it ultimately emerges as predictable that when he assures his fiance he'll 'be right back'something is just bound to go disastrously wrong.Still,it's praiseably original and it's ultimately his life after coming off the island that causes it to linger in the memory more.While the final scenes may drag on in the duration,you strangely want them to be longer on leaving.***",Null,0,1,20 February 2001
The Village," A load of rubbish
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsA group of village dwellers in the late 1800s live across the field from 'those things of which we don't speak.'However,some of the dwellers feel mysteriously compelled to summon these things,and it is from here that the hard reality of their lives begins to eerily creep through.Following on from the excellent Signs and The Sixth Sense and the perfectly watchable Unbreakable,writer/director M Night Shyamalan has now added a new film to his CV which doesn't even match the quality of the latter film and most certainly doesn't patch up to the first two.Considering big name stars like Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson head-billed his last two films,this is a comparatively no name affair,featuring stars that either may have reached the peak but not quite the pinnacle of their careers (Joaquin Phoenix,Adrien Brody) or those who have been out the limelight for far too long for their star power to retain any value (Sigourney Weaver,William Hurt).I actually thought it looked more like a new TV series the first time I saw it and even then it would just be something Shyamalan would just sort of lend his name to.And the damn thing is,despite the fact that they're all moreorless perfectly fine actors (Weaver won an Oscar,for God's sake!) they all seem to turn in really terrible performances here.Even the more experienced cast members feel wooden,unconvincing and terribly,terribly forced.It wouldn't really be fair to single a single one of them out,because they're all the same,but it would be fair to mention that Brody is the only one who really stands out,turning in a fairly good performance as a mentally challenged young man.As previous efforts have shown,this is a guy with seriously good talent as a dramatic actor and,if he keeps picking the right roles,or,even if he turns in good performances in bad films,has a seriously good future ahead of him in Hollywood and if he keeps turning in good performances,how can he go wrong?...Mind you,maybe it's the source material that's weighing them down (hey,anyone see Dennis Quaid around here?)With a story that emerges as unengaging and not particularly interesting,maybe they're having as much fun trawling the script out as we are sitting watching it.As for the film managing to be scary,it's very weird,because although I could see the scary scenes coming from about a mile away,they still managed to make me jump for some reason.But maybe I'm just a sensitive sort of guy.Shyamalan's standard twist comes at the end,although it's truly baffling.I certainly couldn't make any sense of it.But then,maybe I couldn't pay close enough attention to it to be able to.As with all Shyamalan's films up to this point,this is certainly a case of intriguing concept.It's just one that really fails to pay off.*",Null,2,4,1 September 2004
The Revenant," Ultimately a massive case of style over substance
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the late part of the 19th century, explorer Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio-no laughing at that name!) is on an expedition for the fur trade in the wilderness when he is savagely attacked by a bear. Whilst the other members of his expedition team are stoic and try to rescue him, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) decides they should cut their losses and kill him, which he attempts to do when no one is looking, as well as killing his adopted Native American son Hawk (Forrest Goodluck.) After surviving his ordeal, Glass is thrust on a desperate quest for survival-with revenge on his mind.Director Alejandro G. Inarritu is certainly a hot property at the moment, most notably for 2014's Birdman (Or, the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.) As befits someone making a name for themselves, he appears to be someone prepared to break away from convention, taking a relatively simple premise and applying a post modern, surrealist touch to it. But whereas Birdman went engagingly off kilter with its material, this appears to be an exercise in self exploration and reflection...without very much at the surface.In the lead role, and to a large extent the only role, in the film, DiCaprio must carry a sense of isolation and foreboding, in a stranded role similar to that of Sandra Bullock in Gravity or, much further back, Tom Hanks in Cast Away. The problem here is, rather than exploring his individual angst and inner turmoil as he finds the resilience to cope with his ordeal, there's just too much grunting and crawling around, and when you can't relate to one guy for the long time you're with him, there's problems.For those with a keen interest in visual landscapes, Inarritu has undoubtedly captured some truly beautiful, majestic cinematography that will sweep your eyes onto the screen, even if the story and pacing don't. He's matched this with a dark, moody soundtrack that is as haunting as the screen. The trouble is, the story just seems to be non existent and for a film weighing in at roughly two and a half hours, that's a big problem.It's all a big case of style over substance, a big, ultimately pretentious piece that badly misfires. **",4,3,4,19 October 2016
Bridge of Spies," A nice, old fashioned thriller that could have done with a bit more bite
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning At the height of the Cold War, suspected Soviet informant Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is captured, and is due to stand trial. Idealistic lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) agrees to represent him, at a great personal cost to himself and his family. But as the situation escalates, and casualties start being taken on the Russian side, it builds to a dramatic settlement outside the courtroom that will test both sides.Hanks and Spielberg are almost like their own company, obviously an effective partnership that has produced a number of high quality, epic productions over the years. The first thought bound to run through your mind when you see the latest offering from them is: what can go wrong? And so, the third film in a row I've reviewed that's been about spies unravels before me. Artistically, it's everything you'd expect on the tin, two seasoned professionals doing their thing and delivering the goods. In the end, though, it's just a bit too under-whelming to be great.In a day and age of relentless, flashy, fast paced CGI spectacles, it is refreshing to see such an intelligent and intricate story up on the big screen, taking its time to unfold and present all the facts. The drama itself does need to be pretty compelling, though, and sadly Bridge of Spies doesn't always maintain the most exciting pace. Hanks himself is serviceable, but hardly gives the most stirring performance of his career. But then, the trailer promised a dramatization of a man who risks losing everything, whose endurance and sanity are pushed to the very limit, but the script just never really delivers this, just a slow, plodding trot to the end, so he hardly finds himself stretched.It's an undeniably well made, intelligent and generally involving affair, if you're willing to pay attention, it just could have done with a little more meat on the bones underneath. ***",7,1,3,12 December 2015
Pitch Black," Actor's anonymous's latest project
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsI had gone to the cinema with the intention of seeing Memento.I got frustrated as the film started while I was held up in traffic,so,eventually,realising I'd get there quicker running on foot than waiting on the bus any longer,I dashed off ,and,in the cold and damp of winter at this time of year,I raced up to the cinema.After all that strenuous running and endurance of cold weather (besides being late),only to hear they wer'nt showing the printed timeslot of the film as they were having trouble with the projections screen.There were 2 other films to see which were on my current cinema list,so,to narrow it down a bit,I decided instead to get Pitch Black out the way.I've heard many rave reviews about Memento,and I can still only assume it's a much better film than Pitch Black.None of the actor's have ever been heard of before for one thing.This was'nt an initial problem,because nobody had heard of the actor's in Cube,and that was an okay Sci-Fi film.But this was of a different pedigree indeed.The script was as cliche riddled as anything has modernly been,and the characters did'nt make much sense at all.The plot was long and drawn out and was very hard to understand.The young member of the spacecraft itself looked like a mini variant of Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3,once she had her gun with her.The special effects are nothing to write home about,either,as they are so obviously computer generated.Basically,this variant on Alien and Event Horizon is frankly,boring.Still,there are a few genuine shocks here and there,plus some diverting twists that sustain interest in the plot long enough to make it to the end.**",Null,2,4,11 November 2000
Split," A fairly decent Shyamalan film, but that's faint praise
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A trio of girls find themselves abducted from a shopping mall by Dennis (James McAvoy), a man with Disassociative Personality Disorder, who is struggling with twenty three different personalities and who the girls must try and escape from before the 'monsterous' twenty fourth personality emerges.After really disliking 2006's Lady in the Water, I became quite averse to M Night Shyamalan (wasn't a great fan to begin with, really) and after avoiding 2008's critically savaged The Happening never bothered with any of his work again. This has come to an end with Split, an intriguing psychological thriller that taps into the world of multiple personality disorders and unlocks the potential that this condition has for a thriller. While signs (or Signs!) of his Sixth Sense promise do shine through, it's still all a pretty hit and miss affair with some major flaws.In what's at the very least a challenging performance, James McAvoy has to portray twenty three different characters inhabiting one body and mind, and yes, as others have noted, he does do a pretty brilliant job, especially with such a heavy workload on him. Although the character's motives for the multiple kidnappings or his ability to carry them out with such an affliction does make you wonder, before it builds up to a nonsensical ending where he's turned into some werewolf type thing, that messy, self indulgent and overly labourious.Although it's just slightly above rather than below average, to be honest 2003's Identity took this concept of a psychotic multiple personality and worked it to much better effect, and in half the time of Shyamalan's skin of the teeth comeback. ***",7,1,10,2 February 2017

When a suburban American family breakdown there during a cross-country road trip, they find themselves trapped in a desperate battle between themselves and deformed monsters with an insatiable blood lust.Here we have a glossy Hollywood remake of a low budget Wes Craven horror flick from the 70s. Which, of course, I've never seen. In fact the first I knew about it was when I saw it advertised on the side of a bus. Never mind, though, I wasn't around for the original Dawn of the Dead and still thoroughly enjoyed the recent re-make. Which sadly isn't the case with this one.To be fair, it does open fairly well and delivers a promising start to what could be a great horror film. But it soons degenerates, with a clichéd, predictable set-up, a torrent of blood and gore that can't generate one great scare and some laughably misfiring monster make up/design. In the end, we have a film that looks great from the start, but rapidly goes down-Hill from there. **",4,4,6,18 October 2006
Knowing," Intriguing but undelivering sci-fi prophecy film
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Teacher Joe Koestler (Nicolas Cage) is burnt out over his wife's death a few years earlier, and gets by trying to raise his young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) who's interested in science. When a time capsule buried fifty years earlier is dug up at the boy's school, he chooses a piece of paper with a load of numbers on it as his memento- but this piece of paper holds the key to a series of disasters that have occurred since the time it was buried and, to Joe's horror, a series that are about to happen that he is powerless to stop...and the last one's looking set to be the end of the world.Shoot me, I've gone and watched another Nicolas Cage film. His recent output of relentless mediocrity and outright crap should have made me avoid his name like the plague, and Knowing didn't look particularly interesting to watch. Selective director Alex Proyas has chosen this as his latest script, and his old style now seems completely out the window, and the style of his last film, 2004's I, Robot is back in this intriguing but undelivering end of the world thriller.It's clever and a bit unsettling how the sums in the film really do add up to real life disasters in the last few years and how they're worked into the context of the film (if a little inconsiderate to the families of the victims?). What's less impressive is how utterly flat and and unremarkable the end result is. There is no genuine air of tension and suspense in the film, and the ending doesn't feel like it's resolved anything in relation to the rest of the film. Cage simply goes through the motions in the lead role (like we could have expected anything else?) and the supporting cast are stuck in the same boat. Some brilliant special effects sadly can't cover up all the other problems present. It's not awful, and is perfectly watchable in it's own way, but a more dynamic and comprehensible script and a director and lead actor with more verve could have produced much better results. **",4,1,6,15 April 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Pointless in every way other than a financial one
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsT3 is a belated prequel to the 1991 sequel,also starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.Returning to the role that set him on the road to international superstardom,Arnie here reprises his role as the machovelian Terminator.It's hard to say whether or not the first two films director,James Cameron,had it in mind to make this third instalment,or whether this is yet another idea for a movie thought up by unimaginative Hollywood execs unable to come up with original ideas and so just resorting to resurrecting long dormant franchises (although the first sequel did come seven years after the original).But all the same,he isn't and in his place,we have Breakdown helmer Johnathon Mostow.Whether or not this is because Cameron was dissatisfied with the outcome of the script is unknown,but Mostow is a competent enough director as his past efforts have shown.One thing his film is lacking,though, that was dominating Cameron's first two and pretty much made them indistinguishable,is the dark feel that set the scene,in it's place a more lively,jolty feel that will either make or break the film for you.Although,the film's plot just seems like a rehash of the last one with a few things thrown in for window dressing.It's also got to contend with underwhelming set pieces,lifeless humour and rather unappealing dialogue.There are some clever ideas here and there (which are never explored to their full potential though) and there is the gorgeous Kristanna Lokken to add eye candy to the proceedings (she can come and terminate me any day).But overall it has to be described as a rather pointless experience that's box office performance will probably warrant a follow up but which certainly doesn't get your appetite wetted for it's arrival.**",Null,1,2,9 August 2003
U-571," Not as good as I hoped it would be
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIt seems the war genre,despite providing some of the better films of cinematic history,has become one of the quickest to become cliched.It seems the major problem that deterred the enjoyment of U-571 was was how disappointingly ordinary some of the charecters in it were.They all seemed to be stereotyped relics from other war movies,which,given the talent at hand here,I found to be rather unacceptable.Although in fairness,I don't think this film cared much for it's second world war setting,it just seemed to be set against the backdrop of this,and used it as an excuse to create a not awfully thrilling action film.None of the performers seemed to be dishing out the Saving-Private-Ryan esque oscar hammieness such a film would have definetly required.On the thriller front,I've never really found a team of men racing around an underwater boat,shouting a load of mathematical terminology ,e.g.,in this case metres,yards and soforth very thrilling,yet this film seems to rally around this rather than explore the interesting concept behind the story (which was quite impressively handled)as much as it could have.None of the performances,ranging from Matthew McHoneghey to Bill Paxton to Harvey Keitel ,were genuinely emoting ,because,perhaps thanks largely to the script,they were either too in-your-face ,or too cliched.It's a shame because I was really hoping to enjoy this movie.**",Null,0,1,28 June 2000
"I, Robot"," Fairly enjoyable sci-fi romp
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThe year is 2035.Robots have not eradicated mankind as the next race,but have instead learned to co-exist with them in relative harmony.They live by three simple rules:1.)A robot must never harm a human.2.)A robot must obey any order given to it by a human (unless that order contradicts the other rule.3.)A robot must protect it's own existence at any cost (unless that order contradicts the other two.Det. Spooner (Will Smith),however,maintains a prejudiced attitude towards them.When the renowned Dr Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell,in what is practically a cameo role) is found dead at his workplace,the victim of an apparent suicide,the finger of suspicion points at Sonny (Alan Tidyk) a robot found never the crime scene.But as events unravel,they start to reveal a much bigger conspiracy...I decided to give this film another go,as for some reason I was rather tired when I went to see it at the cinema and found myself nodding off towards the end.It plays on a familiar theme of whether machines can display emotions and feelings and learn to be human.As the technological age dawns further over us,however,it maintains a certain relevance unlike any other film of it's sort.It also puts questions in our minds whether,as we took over the dinosaurs,so machines will take over us,and ends up serving as a sort of unwitting premonition of things to come (or may have,to a certain extent,happened already.)In the lead role,Smith is his typical wise-cracking self and is on good form.The robot design of Sonny is impressive but ultimately destined for parody in the same way Gollum out of Lord of the Rings was.However,Alex Proyas's direction is meandering and wavey.After 10 years as a mainstream director,his best effort remains his debut feature The Crow.The action sequences are impressive,but not brilliant.Overall,this is certainly a very watchable and enjoyable film,and one with a grim premonition for the future of mankind like Blade Runner 20 years before it.It just fails to seem to come together and really be the sum of it's parts.***",Null,1,2,12 December 2004
American Beauty," Suburban nightmare for America
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsAmerican Beauty follows pretty much in the outline of Fight Club,the best film I have seen in a very long time,in it's themes about commercial fulfillment,the barriers constricting the boredom of life,and human emptieness.The best scene to reflect this I found in here was when the films main charecter Lester,played by Kevin Spacey,has a go at his wife after she makes a quip to him about not spilling any of his beer on an expensive new sofa she's got.This scene quite brilliantly reflects how the commercial value of our possessions has become our main cause for concern,rather than concern for each other. Or maybe this is just the suburban situation in America.Whatever the wake up call was aimed at,whoever it's targeted towards ought to take note.Though the main character is initially seeming quite intent to accept his boring life,we learn that underneath the kind of easy going exterior he puts on,a lot of people are actually taking advantage of him,his boss,his colleagues,his daughter,his wife.This movie remarkably portrays how glamourous and satisfying breaking free from a constraint on your life can be.Aside from the main character, all of the other characters are pretty sad cases as well.His wife is a self obsessed,over expectant career woman,who only gets sad about what's bothering her.His daughter is a distant,stubborn teenager ,who does'nt give any clear indication of what she wants.Her friend is a narrow minded,pretentious,and stupid slapper,who prides herself on how sexually explicit her shenanigans with other men are.And as for the new neighbours,well.....................perfect example of how American families are supposedly losing the ability to communicate,understand,love,and,heck,even know each other.This film perfectly captures you in each of these shallow people's miserable lives,and gets you caring about their various outcomes.All the performances are,obviously,excellent,and Sam Mendes provides unique,insightful direction into a film which requires these new touches.Overall,having seen it,I'm glad American Beauty won all the oscars it did.For once,they gave them to a film that truly deserved it.*****",Null,5,11,5 August 2000
Wanted," Slick and flashy but without a lot of substance to make it memorable
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) has a boring job working behind a desk, without the guts to stand up to his bullying boss or do anything about the fact his best friend is shagging his girlfriend. But that all changes one night in a convenience store when a lady named Fox (Angelina Jolie) saves him from being killed by the guy who killed his father. He learns his father was part of an organization called The Fraternity who've been around for many years killing those selected from a weaving machine whose existence poses a threat to others. The head of the organization, Sloan (Morgan Freeman) has him trained to be like his dad and he progresses well, until an apparent assassination attempt on him draws him to a man named Pekwarsky (Terrence Stamp) who casts a different light on things.Wanted is adapted from a 'graphic novel', as is becoming quite the craze at the moment, and seems to rely more on the flashiness and style of this than anything deeper. A grown up comic book of a movie, with gratuitous sex, violence and swearing by the bucketload, this truly feels like a big case of style over substance, with a messy, convoluted, possibly over-ambitious plot (that, as others have noted, does bear similarities with The Matrix), with thin characterization and a deadly lack of substance. I've not heard of director Timur Bekmambetov before, but I bet he had some sort of past as a music video director or something along those lines, because that's the impression his film gives off.Cast wise, a wide range of famous name actors, from Jolie to Freeman, fail to make anything out of such uninspiring and flat characters and when talents like this can't save anything, you know you're in trouble.It's not awful. It's sharp and well written in parts, with some funny lines and some cool stunts, including killing a mafia guy while in a car flying over him and a nice bit involving a train going off the rails toward the end. But it all seems to drag rather than keep you hooked. Never mind what I've said though, enough people liked it that a sequel's apparently already being made, but from me it's certainly most un-Wanted. **",4,14,30,11 July 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Still a breathtaking spectacle that puts all the modern blockbusters to shame
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter the first Terminator sent by Skynet failed to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in 1984, she has now found herself holed up in a mental institution, while her young son John (Edward Furlong) is an unruly delinquent. But now, they've managed to send the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a more advanced and destructive killer, back in time to kill John before he grows up and becomes the leader who will lead The Resistance to victory. However, TR have also sent a machine, the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who looks exactly the same as the bad one from the last film, back to protect him. The battle begins...After the cult success of the original Terminator film in the early 80s, it seemed James Cameron had opted to avoid the law of diminishing returns and simply leave it as a standing testament to brilliant sci-fi, not that anyone could blame him. So, it was quite a gamble of him many years later, as a new decade dawned and other things had come along, to throw a load of money and time into a much bigger budgeted, bigger scaled sequel. But, unbelievably, it paid off, creating a film that's lasted the ages and late last year, was re-released in a brand new 3D print and is now available in the same format on DVD, so a new generation of film-goers could savour its breath taking cinematic marvel.It's right up there with the likes of Star Wars and Lawrence of Arabia, as one of the great epic movies, a lengthy, lavish production, that broke boundaries with its special effects and graphics, that show their age a little bit today but still have an undeniable awe-inspiring quality about them. But the important thing is that Cameron doesn't forget why a strong, central story and characters you can care about are so important. Throughout, there are some subtle observations about the human condition and the nature of survival that make it stand out a country mile from your average sci-fi.In a day and age where the latest big, massive blockbuster is churned out a dime a dozen, with barely a fraction of the heart and soul, Cameron's masterpiece is an enduring testament where they came along far less often but produced a far more magical and unforgettable experience. It's a none stop, thrill a minute ride that you are made to feel a part of, and it's hard to think of another title more deserving of being reborn in the 3D format. *****",10,3,8,18 January 2018
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A very rare occasion when the sequel was superior to the original
","STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh Following on from the last movie, Sarah Connor (again played by Linda Hamilton) is now locked in a secure mental institution raving about Judgment Day and how six billion lives are going to end on August 29th 1997. Meanwhile her son John (Edward Furlong), the future resistance leader, has grown up without a stable father/mother figure and is now a rebellious young delinquent with no idea of how important he will come to be in his seemingly hopeless future. But Skynet is out to try it's luck again. Having failed to stop John from even being born, it sends a new soldier back in time, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) an advanced prototype with advanced strength and speed and the ability to morph into anyone it comes into contact with (as well as being able to make it's hands turn into long, sharp objects) to kill John in his youth. However, once again the resistance is able to send a fighter, in the shape of The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) this time on the good guys side. As well as evading the T-1000, The Terminator must find John, break his mother free and stop inventor Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) from putting 'Skynet' on line and causing an apocalypse.Seven years after the first (and much cheaper looking) film was released, James Cameron stepped back behind the director's seat and gave the world Terminator 2, a slick and breath-taking film that was the most expensive film ever made at the time of it's release (good job it made back the revenue!) Alongside The Godfather, this is one of the only films I can think of where the sequel out did the original. The last film repeated, T2 combines some nice human drama, characterization and thought-provoking commentary on the nature of humanity and war with some awe-inspiring spectacle, in the shape of awesome action sequences, out of this world special effects which will still knock the socks off you a few years on, brilliant production design and unforgettable characters. It is an all-round, none stop, unforgettable thrill ride of a film. Forget the minor technical glitch of why the resistance have sent back a warrior exactly the same as the one in the last film (only good!) and not a human fighter or the sometimes depressingly dark and drainy feel of the film, this is one movie that is destined to truly stand the test of time. *****",10,2,5,24 August 2006

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThose who can cast their minds back to Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 adaptation of Bram Stoker's horror masterpiece Dracula will remember the titular VH as a ragged,dishevelled old fella played by Anthony Hopkins.Here,he's played by the not quite so convincing but more relatably youthful Hugh Jackman.Here,his mission is to travel to Transylvania and assist in the extermination of Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) so that the family of Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) may finally see the gates of Heaven.In it's favour,director Stephen Sommers's film certainly has an interesting,well conceived concept on his hands,not unlike that of last year's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,which I have yet to see.It just doesn't manage to execute it quite as well as it could have.A big part of the problem is really with the script.When it works,it can be fairly engaging and even rather enthralling.When it fails,it is laughably bad,with cast members made to roll off lines of embarrassingly terrible,botched dialogue in as wooden a manner as possible.It blows hot and blows cold as it does,and as such makes the whole story one that doesn't manage to totally engage you throughout.On the cast front,in the lead role,Jackman is fairly bland and unaffecting,just about competent enough but just not quite giving the role that edge it so badly needed to be brilliant.Beckinsale is voluptuous and has positive sex appeal as the heroine.And Shuler Hensley has an inadvertently appealing role as Frankenstein's monster,managing to illicit a quiet,bumbling sympathy that is quite a pleasant highlight indeed.But then there's Roxburgh's Dracula,who just has this sort of off-putting comic feel to him that really effects the flow of the thing.He fails to be really menacing in any way,like a lighter version of Billy Drago out of Delta Force 2.And that ain't good.The movie also benefits from some genuinely rather effective jump scenes and some quite impressive action sequences here and there (it would be a summer blockbuster,after all).But on the whole,very watchable though it is,it is never as much fun or as exploitative of it's opportunities as it could have been.It's not particularly bad and not particularly good.And considering what it could have been,ladies and gentlemen,that is what I call one wasted opportunity.***",Null,1,2,3 June 2004
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Just Hollywood doing what it does with foreign greats, really, but done slickly and successfully enough to be a hit
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Swedish journalist Mikhael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has had his credibility shattered after losing a court case brought against him by a giant corporation for printing an alleged in-truth. With his career hanging in the balance, Mikhael accepts an offer from an eccentric man named Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to locate a girl who went missing over forty years ago. As he digs deeper into the case, he uncovers a pattern of serial killings that may hint at the girls disappearance, as well as a dysfunctional family that want to tear each other's throats out. Mikhael finds he must join forces with troubled, socially awkward freelance journalist Lisbeth (Rooney Mara) who was involved in gaining insider information about him to his enemies in court, in order to get on top of a deadly net that's closing in on him.Not a town known for it's creativity and original ideas (and, with a recession blazing, even more so) Hollywood has a history of adapting foreign films that have gained a cult status (that it's dubious whether they'd have got had they actually been from there originally) and turning them into bigger budget productions that are often, to say the least, not as good as their source material. Thankfully, this is not the case with David Fincher's adaptation of Sieg Larson's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, the first of what promises to be a trilogy of adaptations of novels in the series.Having seen the original film, and been impressed with the visceral way it gets under your skin, there were few genuine surprises in store for me here in the way the story pans out, but it remains a compelling murder mystery, as well as a dark, unflinching glare into the heart and mind of a serial killer, which Fincher handles the way he's handled similar themes before in films such as Zodiac and Se7en. The Hollywood style has naturally granted it a sleeker, glossier look than it's Swedish inspiration, but it still maintains a dark veneer through out, which is matched by the style and the soundtrack.Performances wise, Craig is an inspired choice in the lead role, his intense acting style perfect for the role, while Mara is a revelation as the unfriendly, unsociable but troubled and sympathetic young woman. Since they're the main driving force of the story, it's fitting they're all playing related characters, but as the support cast the likes of Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard and Joely Richardson are a credit too, really creating the impression of a family where everyone hates each other's guts and each are holding secrets from each other that could serve to shatter.With a 158 minute running time, and having to live up to the standards of such great source material, Fincher's film would have to pull a real cat out of the bag to work and, thankfully, it's done it, the first Hollywood slant on a series of works that will hopefully set the tone for the rest. ****",9,1,5,14 January 2012
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," One long tasteless joke and not a very funny one
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits The gross-out comedy looks like it will strike another hit with The 40 Year Old Virgin, as well as make a big star out of Steve Carrell, waiting for his big break after supporting roles in films such as Anchorman and Bruce Almighty.He plays Andy Stitzer. Andy works in an electronics store. He fits in with his work colleagues, does his job well and doesn't stand out that much other than his funny dress sense, the fact he rides a bike to work and his virginal qualities that his mates have started to notice. When his 'shameful' secret is revealed, the mates go to extreme lengths to get him to pop his cherry, but as events roll on, Andy discovers it's best to just let life roll on as it will and let things happen in the natural scheme of things, as he develops a relationship with a woman who is set to become a grand-mother at roughly the same age as him.The film is too long. This might not have been such a problem had the film had more of a sentimental edge to it, a la Mrs Doubtfire, but it entertains it's near-the-knuckle laughs side a bit too much to really make it this way. That's not to mention the NTK laughs that actually cross the boundary into tastelessness, i.e. the drink driving scene with the woman with her own breathalyser and Andy in the car, which the many families of DD victims might want to complain about. You could argue the whole film is like this, but, that's your opinion. Successfully, I found the film to be rarely funny, extremely funny when it is but not that often.It may have just caught me on a bad day and Carrell does have what seems to be a promising future as a leading man in comedies, but the impression I've initially come away with isn't much of a good one. **",4,7,14,9 September 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Off beat but not unenjoyable comedy/drama
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning When his personal life takes a knock, Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) goes off to become a reporter in Iraq, as the war takes off in 2003. Whilst there, he crosses paths with Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney), a former soldier himself who tells him about a man in the Vietnam war called Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), a free spirit who showed the best way to defeat the enemy is with the mind. From here, we follow the adventures of the two men applying this philosophy to modern war, until their encounter with disciplinarian commanding officer Hooper (Kevin Spacey) who's determined to have his way or the high way.The title alone should give some indication of this film being aimed at a particular type of audience, those that prefer the quirkier, more off beat type of film, and the typical type of cast that would go with it. As such, it's an occasionally funny, relatively well made piece that is refreshingly brief and so doesn't become too self indulgent or wavey. It's none of the cast's finest hour, and they've surely done this type of thing better somewhere else before, but it's a distracting and subversive enough piece, that will probably find a cult audience with some. ***",7,0,1,28 June 2010
Spider-Man," Delivers
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsOne of (if not the) most eagerly touted movies of the summer,Spider-Man's publicity campaign has certainly been huge.But does the film live up to expectations?Yes and no.The film is based on a popular comic book of the same name,like predecessors Batman and Superman.And bearing this in mind,the plot bears true to a story found in a comic magazine,which may not make it particularly good on the big screen,but at least makes it faithful.And the acting is also really good and effecting.Tobey Maguire isn't particularly convincing as an action hero,but this doesn't matter because he spends the action sequences with his face covered by a mask anyway.Away from there,he delivers a tender and well emoted performance,as does Kirsten Dunst with her role as the sweet natured romantic interest.And William Dafoe wonderfully plays a sly,dastardly comic book villain with pizzaz.The area where the movie falls flat however,is with the dialogue ,which is really flat and uninspired.Nothing to rival the really drab fluent offerings in Attack of the Clones,but still a rather big hinderance to the film.The thing that is impressive before you've even seen the movie is the Spiderman suit,which is actually something to rival the Robocop suit.And the special effects in general are rather mind blowing ,if being swung around a lot doesn't bother you.Okay,so perhaps not as good as it could have been (or is made out to be),but it doesn't look like it will be one of the worst Summer blockbusters at all.****",Null,0,1,15 June 2002
Jarhead," Mendes hasn't reached his master-stroke with this one but he's made a good and memorable film all the same
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Adapted from his own novel of his experiences during wartime, the film tells the story of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) a young man who enlists in the army as the Gulf War takes off. Sent to a post in the desert with other members of his unit, they don't find a war taking place but just a need to be on constant alert. Their Staff Seargent Sykes (Jamie Foxx) trains them to be brutal killers in combat and a life or two was even lost in training- only for them to face nothing actually in the way of danger. The film becomes a study of how these men, namely Swofford, cope with the pressures of being on constant alert and the unbelievable boredom that breaks out as they sit around expecting the fight of their lives, only to return to a victory parade without having the honour of having faced any combat for their country.Brit director Sam Mendes hit it off with the unforgettably powerful American Beauty, but he followed it up a few years later with the gangster flick Road to Perdition, which, in my eyes anyway, was a bit under-whelming. This new film of his is shot in a style and told in a way that is unlike his previous two efforts, with a slightly more docu-drama style, some might say. It's a strategy that pays off, fairly well.The film has a few quietly absorbing moments to it, as well as a few powerful and disturbing scenes from lead star Gylennhaal. If only his co-stars were as good, unfortunately, they're mostly all wasted in supporting roles, most notably Chris Cooper. Foxx is commanding in a co-starring role but even he seems to have limited screen time.Unfortunately, the film is about boredom and, as such, sometimes the actual story itself tends to become a little dreary itself leaving the film a collection of great bits rather than a thoroughly brilliant whole. ***",7,0,1,13 June 2006
Collateral," Just manages not to be style over substance
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsSpoiler Los Angeles cab driver Max (Jamie Foxx) picks up a man named Vincent (Tom Cruise),unaware he is a contract killer and that he is unwittingly driving him to his next hit.From here,he is held hostage and lead on a nightmare journey that will test his character to the limit.When I reviewed The Last Samurai earlier this year,I commented that I wasn't awfully fond of watching Tom Cruise movies,as I thought he was 'more of a movie star than an actor.'Well,he appears to have taken this contention to heart,as he certainly wants to come across as a serious actor by the way he's conveying himself here.He gives himself a sort of Ray Liotta edge here,and you can't help thinking he would be a better actor to be playing the lead role had he the star power to do so.He doesn't totally manage to convince,though.And neither,it has to be said,does Foxx in the co-starring role.One thing the movie has going in it's favour,though,is an absorbing visual style that is distinctly Michael Mann all the way.The camera style and the overviews of the New York skyline are most entrancing and the lengthy dialogue interludes are very Tarantino-esque.The style might convince some that perhaps Mann was the wrong choice of director for the project,but once (and if) you come to accept him,the movie manages to be more absorbing.It can't compensate,though,for a wavey storyline and an ending that might seem a bit contrived and just an excuse to include Jada Pinkett Smith's character again.That's not to mention Cruise's death scene,which,shall we say,somewhat stretches plausibility to the limits.For it all,though,the movie manages to be good.Just not great.***",Null,0,1,9 October 2004
Dunkirk," An all new cinematic experience, delivered by none other than Nolan
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning For his latest big budget, big spectacle cinematic experience, Christopher Nolan has taken his first foray into the world of a war film, rather than the sci-fi/fantasy flicks he's been known for in recent years. And yet, in his desperate quest to push the boundaries of conventional filmmaking, on this occasion he's produced a film that doesn't actually have any discernible plot to speak of, and is based entirely around the plight of a situation a group of disparate men from different sides of the Allied front during the titular battle. This is a film based entirely in the unfolding moment of the here and now, and his distinctive style has never been more tightly stamped on anything he's made. It may leave some wondering if he was the right director for the project, and how it could have panned out in the hands of someone with a more traditional approach to a war film, say, Steven Spielberg with Saving Private Ryan, but this only serves to highlight how this is an all new filmic experience in its own right.We open in a scene completely drowned of any dialogue, completely soaked up in atmosphere, punctuated by a harsh, drained camera lens and reinforced by a typically heavy score from long time Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer. The immediacy of the moment is captured quite magically, in spite of the lack of superficial things, and the feeling of being an average soldier in the middle of the unfolding fear and madness is feels as real as you can imagine. In focusing on being in the moment, and not on the characters as individuals, yes, Nolan does drown out some sense of character development and emotional investment, but this is further evidence of the films experimental style, asking you to be moved by the immediate plight of the protagonists, rather than the inner battles each respective person is fighting.Once again, an all star cast has been rounded up, including former One Direction star Harry Styles, as well as the likes of Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance, although in roles that don't mark any of them down in any individual way. Later on in the film, Nolan also unleashes some of the most breath-taking cinematography he's ever delivered us, over the seas and over the cliffs, almost as magical and majestical as flying over these places for real (but under different circumstances.) In spite of the minimal characterization, there's still a genuine sense of peril and tension of characters during danger sequences, in tightly confined quarters and with time racing against the affected party.Nolan is a director who refuses to do things by half, or in a way that an audience expects or can even comprehend, and while it may overwhelm many, it can be beautifully appreciated by those who look beyond the surface, and absorb a new filmic style. *****",10,6,14,1 August 2017

While the 'bad' idea worked well in recent efforts (Bad Santa) the concept here just fails to materialize and is just dumb. And, most killingly of all, not funny. It's unbelievable someone as stupid and irresponsible as Halsey would even be a teacher in the first place, and from this small acorn the whole forest crumbles.

Captain America: Civil War," On a grander scale than before, but still more Age of Ultron than Avenger's Assemble
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Following a calamitous tragedy in Nigeria, the Avengers find themselves being hounded for regulation, and to become accountable for their actions. Tony Stark can see the reasoning in this, while Rogers believes the team should have the power to go about their affairs in total freedom. This builds to a climactic showdown between the two opposing sides, before an even deadlier enemy threatens to throw them all into total oblivion.The serious cinema-goer has certainly, over the last few years, been forced to have a radical attitude re-adjustment to the concept of the superhero film, and its possibilities in the grand scheme of filmic merit. It's gone from being the sole preserve of an exclusive, distinctive flock of audience, to being accepted on a more grand, theatrical level. These child-minded figures, in their peculiar and fanciful costumes, have been heralded as almost Shakespearian in their Machiavellianism, and Captain America: Civil War is the logical conclusion to this thumping pomposity.Strangely, with all this in mind, the film is ultimately still most impressive as an action spectacular, dazzling when brought to life in 3D, and taking you on a magical, mystical action packed journey that bursts into life at various points in its nearly three hour length. This is truly aiming to be the biblical comic book film, exploring relevant, human themes and placing the various iconic characters in respective roles. All of this, though, is its curse as well as its blessing.As sensibly impressive as it is, ultimately most of it's problems can be started with the word over. It's overlong, overblown, overwrought, overbearing, overwhelming and presumably over-budget. All of this causes it to lose the fun factor a bit, and so Avenger's Assemble remains the best of the lot. ***",7,1,6,12 May 2016
American History X," Mind blowingly brilliant drama
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After his fireman father is killed responding to a call in a black neighbourhood as a teenager, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) takes his racist beliefs on board and becomes a hard core Neo Nazi skinhead and forms an allegiance with people with like minded beliefs. It all culminates one night when he uses brutally excessive force on two black criminals who try and rob his house, killing them and being sent to prison for a few years. Upon his release, he is a changed man and wants to distance himself from the life he once lead- unfortunately, his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) appears to be heading down the same path, getting in trouble with school head master Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) for writing an essay on 'Mein Kempth.' It's a race against time to direct him down the right path.Most of the most respected and well known of actors burst on to the scene with some sort of springboard, some role that gained them recognition and got them tipped as a future star to watch out for. This, surely, was what served for Edward Norton. For his breath taking performance here is the sheer driving force of this amazing examination of the cancer of hatred and the violence and self destruction that evolves. There is a passion and raw intensity delivered from him, that makes it so good it in fact reduces Stephen Graham's crazed skinhead in This is England to a poor man's version of it. That assured delivery and natural screen presence is something he would make himself notable with in future roles such as 25th Hour, although there's probably plenty of others that others prefer. Furlong, Brooks, Stacey Keach and Beverley D'Angelo are solid support but the star of the show is really leading it here.Tony Kaye has delivered an unflinching, shocking, emotionally draining film with a devastating and hopeless conclusion that serves as the real life denounement that there's rarely a happy ending. It set Norton on the path to super stardom and is one of the more shocking dramas out there. *****",10,0,2,21 April 2010
Saw III," Overall a pretty tacky excuse to move from one sadistic, stomach-churning scene to another
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After taking care of two random victims, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) goes in for the kill and traps Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) a man in a deep state of grief after losing his son in a drink driving accident. He sets him a series of challenges to save the lives of those caught up in his sons death (including a female driver who failed to stop and help, the judge who gave the killer a pathetic sentence, and finally, the killer himself) to test his resolve and to stop him languishing in a state of veangefulness. Meanwhile, he also takes Jeff's wife Lynn (Bahar Soometh) a brash doctor who pushes everyone away from her to operate on the tumour that is killing him, with the help of Amanda (Shawnee Smith) his former victim.All three of the Saw movies have seemed to pride themselves more on delivering stomach-churning gore than genuine scares and they've reached a crescendo with Saw III, a truly nasty piece of work that reportedly had paramedics being called in to deal with fainting cinema-goers who couldn't handle the movie's sheer level of blood and gore. There's plenty of morbidly imaginative Hellraiser style death scenes on display that see some characters die some of the grusomest deaths imaginable (check out the terrifying looking thing the drunk driver is attached to at the end and the torture he is made to endure!), but it's actually the most realistic gory scene that proves the hardest to stomach, where a drill is used to go into Jigsaw's skull and operate on his brain. Somehow seeing the real sort of thing is even nastier than the most unpleasant death device the screen-writers could dream up.Plot wise, the movie's pretty defunct. We open with two murders that bear no relevance to the 'story' that's about to unfold, which basically consists of moving from one gory set-piece to another in a none stop attempt to turn the stomachs of the viewers as much as possible. There seems to be some ridiculous rhyme and reason to Jigsaw's motives, wherein a sadistic killer tries to make a man feeling justifiable anger and vengeance get his humanity back as well as trying to get people to appreciate life by making them crawl and scream for it. There's some fairly good acting on display though, Macfadyen raw and determined as the tragic anti-hero as well as Bell's calm, rationalizing psychopath but, unlikely as it seems, one just hopes this is the last of the odious Saw movies before the series gets the chance to get anymore morally adventurous. **",4,3,6,28 November 2006

Tropic Thunder," So absurd and clever you can't help but laugh at it
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMega stars from the world of action, Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), comedy, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and serious drama Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) have come together to make Tropic Thunder, a big budget action picture set in the jungles of South East Asia. Unfortunately, the director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is having a terrible time of making it, and Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), the studio head financing it, orders him to take his three stars on a tour around the volatile area without the cameras and crew following them around so they get a feel for the real danger they need to portray. However, after Cockburn's unfortunate death, the team realize this may not be as safe a learning experience as they thought.I've never been a massive fan of Ben Stiller, but Tropic Thunder is probably his best film since Meet the Parents. Not that that's any great shakes, as even that was only awarded ***, but in terms of Stiller and his brand of comedy, this is another big hit (as opposed to something like, say, Zoolander which flew right over me.)This is a film obsessed with being clever and taking the p!ss. From the trailers at the beginning, sending up big budget, no brainer action films, the low brow humour of American comedies, and Robert Downey Jr, who appears to be sending up Russell Crowe, Mr. T from The A Team and, er, himself. Quite how Stiller managed to get all these big name stars involved (many of which in roles they'd never normally do) for something that, while funny is hardly the most hilarious idea ever, is anyone's guess, but do it he has. The sheer absurdity of it all is what generates most of the laughs, from Stiller's mentally impaired farmboy act that amuses those who come to be his captors, Black's obnoxious fatty with a secret drug problem and, of course, Cruise's bumpin' and grindin' studio exec. The break-through role though, is that of child star Brandon Soo Hoo, as a high pitched, angry, kung fu kicking child commander of the Asian army. The film's problems, though, are a disjointed plot and being at least ten minutes too long, but with all those egos wanting to hog all that screen time, a lot more probably ended up on the cutting room floor.Tropic Thunder is not the greatest comedy ever. It's not even really good. But it's an undeniably clever send up of Hollywood and famous actors that gets by on how absurd it all is as well. ***",7,1,2,15 February 2009
The Usual Suspects," It's true what they say- you'll have to see this film at least twice to completely understand it
","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs A group of known criminals are rounded up for a police line up in a rather unusual fashion. As their lawyers wait to post bail, they agree to pull off another job together. Told in flashback, Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) a crippled, informed member of the group recounts to a hard-pressing customs officer (Chazz Palmenteri) how the others were killed and the possible involvement of the mysterious, mythical 'Keyser Soze.' I decided I'd been a film connoisseur far too long to have not seen or reviewed this extremely critically acclaimed work. And last night (after a failed recording on Sky Movies a few weeks back!) my dream finally came true. Back when it originally came out, I guess you could say I had a sort of different slant on what made a film appeal to me, but now I am far more eager to seek out and review far more acclaimed work such as this.Shot in just, I think it was 30 days?!?, like Reservoir Dogs, this was a low budget production with a shining concept behind it to ultimately make it stand out more than any of the summer blockbusters that had been released shortly before it. It's a fairly simple story (not really high-concept in any way) that could have had a really simple delivery, but the film cleverly twists and turns it into another one of those ones where you have to pay attention to everything that is being said and inferred. It's probably one of the most impressive efforts of such a film I've seen, in as much as I only saw it last night and, yep, like other critics before me said I would, I still think I need a repeat viewing just to have another go at trying to make sense of it all.Like RD, this film head-billed a group of debut/small-time actors and sent their respective fortunes spiralling either way. Benicio Del Toro went from strength to strength, whilst Spacey would go on to achieve Hollywood gold status. On the other hand, Gabriel Byrne still only enjoyed co-starring appearances in various films, whilst Stephen Baldwin just plopped back into mediocrity and the other guy (says it all that I can't even remember his name!), well, I think I saw him working in Tescos the other week (Hollywood can be so cruel...) Also, like RD, the film made a name of it's director, Bryan Singer, who would go on to enjoy further success with the X-Men films.Occasionally, just occasionally, I think Hollywood needs films like this to pop up and flush a load of new talent on the screen. I'm certainly glad I finally saw it and look forward to a (possible) second viewing tonight. *****",10,1,3,23 June 2005

However, it becomes apparent that by travelling through time and collecting all the 'Infinity Stones', they might be able to create a space in time where they will be able to step in from the past and reverse the present. With all the gang lost in limbo after their defeat, they must muster all their strength together once again to save the planet.Despite rave reviews that made the previous Infinity War appear average, I took the sweetest of time getting round to see the even latest addition in the Marvel universe films. You can't manufacture yourself into a comic book nerd, which would appear to be the best course of action to take in the present climate, where superhero movies have become more of an industry than a franchise. The suffix here is Endgame, which is surely what IW was meant to be, especially given the rug pulling, unexpected ending. But, in Hollywood movies, the good guys have always got to win, even if it means bringing them back to life through some ridiculously convoluted, Back to the Future riffing tale.I'm all for action movies with lots of character development and effective backstories, but the Russo brothers here lavish each of their flashy, colourful protagonists with the sort of intimate examination you might expect from Ang Lee, fleshing out their humanity at the expense of any exciting action, which the devotees will be expecting. It's a detrimentally overlong and drawn out affair, that builds up to a big crowd pleasing finale at the end which is worth sticking around for, but has nearly worn you out completely by the time its got there.For these legions of comic book fans that seem to have emerged over the last few years, it's a dream come true.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Opening up where the last film left off, Bond (Daniel Craig) is caught up in a car chase in Italy, which, being Bond, he manages to escape. He reaches his destination and a villain who's come along for a ride with him is to be shaken down for information. But the mysterious organization Bond wants to know about has eyes and ears everywhere and another dramatic scene unfolds as he is broken free. Anyway, there's a new villain on the scene in the shape of Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) who MI5 have surveillance on. Bond is assigned to keep tracks on him and his apparent plans to pillage the water supply of the South American country of Bolivia. Sensing he's getting too close to the case, M (Judi Dench) assigns Agent Strawberry Fields (Gemma Anderton) to bring him back in. But Bond sticks on the case, and as he goes about his business, he appears to have blurred the line between agent and villain. As he is suspected of criminal activity, are his actions being motivated by duty to queen and country...or is he acting on his own personal vendetta? Brosnan's tenure was up. The last story in Ian Fleming's original creations had been reached and all that was left was to go back to the beginning. This was the perfect chance for a new Bond. A sharper Bond. A Bond with edge and sass. A more raw, real Bond. A Bond for the new ages. He was a bit stiff and humourless. Made Tim Dalton seem like Jim Carrey, in fact. But he had undeniable presence, a sense of suaveness, a gritty, hard nosed Bond that looked like he meant business. His name was Daniel Craig. And his film was Casino Royale. It went over my head first time but on second viewing it was clear Bond had been brought back with a bang. It's even more clear when faced with something as unremarkable and disappointing as Quantum of Solace.After another dismal, unmemorable opening song, we're back in business in terms with what Bond's meant to provide. The action, from the car chases, gun battles, stunts and hand to hand combat are all top notch, but with such little heart and substance to guide it along, it all gets boring after a while. The apathetic story makes things even more droll, and the overall lack of heart going on here really makes things bad, even with Paul Haggis, the acclaimed writer of Million Dollar Baby and director of Crash, on hand. Performances wise, Craig retains his presence in the lead role, even trying to loosen up, awkwardly quipping off the obligatory Bond one liners and the odd off beat quip here and there. But Amalric is a weak villain with no edge and even worse is Gemma Anderton and her ridiculously named Bond girl character. Though she gets mercifully brief screen time, her performance is so wooden she makes more impression *mild spoiler* as an oil saturated corpse on a freshly made hotel bed than in person. Olga Kurylenko as the main Bond girl also fails to add substance to anything.In a day and age where lengthy 'blockbuster' films are drawn out with lots of back story, QOS deserves some praise for being the shortest Bond film ever. But, after the massive impact of Casino Royale, this only ends up going further to show the lack of effort and heart that's been put into this very disappointing second outing for Craig. **",4,3,7,18 November 2008
The Butterfly Effect," Disappointing
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsEvan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is a young man who suffered a troubled childhood.He was sexually abused,nearly killed by his psychotic father and was constantly menaced by a psychotic childhood chum.However,he's grown up into a relatively normal and focused fraternity brother and appears to have accepted all the hands that fate has dealt him.Until,that is,he discovers a way of altering his past to make his present better.However,it is from here that he discovers that maybe it is better to just let memories be memories.This is the latest in a long line of movies to deal with the concept of reverse plotting,perfected to style with 2000's Memento and dallied with up to this point.There are,admittently,a number of interesting ideas swimming around here,but even if you pay close attention to it,the plot feels totally disjointed and hard to make out,not to mention follow.It's senseless,is what I'm trying to say.As a result,it all winds up as one big emotionally uninvolving affair.And that's a big complaint to bear in mind for two hours.On the performances front,Kutcher is pretty much impossible to take seriously in the lead role.He is a comedic actor and his transition to serious acting puts him in the forefront of bad acting in a year of bad leading male performances.In the supporting role,Amy Smart is easily the best thing in it,but,well,there you go...The Butterfly Effect ultimately emerges as a wasted opportunity on all fronts.It coulda been worse,that's for sure.But it could also have been one hell of a lot better.**",Null,8,15,21 August 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Could have been immensely enjoyable but instead comes off as strictly watchable
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsDr Wood (Sanaa Lathan) is asked to head an expedition out to Antartica to explore the remains of an ancient pyramid.Already skeptical about her crew's lack of training,upon arrival,she finds even more reason to worry when they realize they are not alone.The aliens and the predators want to duke it out for ultimate supremacy.......and whoever wins...we lose.Lance Henriksen makes an appearance as the Bishop character he originally played 18 years ago in the film Aliens,who's now head of Weyland Enterprises,who fund the expedition.Aside from this,the film makes limited use of the mountainous potential it had to poke fun at itself and be self-referentialising and self-depreciating and instead kind of takes itself a bit too seriously.A few years ago,the film's director,Paul Anderson,made a film I thoroughly enjoyed by the name of Event Horizon.Since then,he's gone on to make more strictly action-orientated stuff like the Kurt Russell film Soldier or the Resident Evil movie.That this movie lacks EH's eerie sense of impending claustrophobia and instead chooses to follow in the afore-mentioned film's footsteps serves as a real set-back for it.The action itself,namely in the shape of Alien and Preddie's battles,isn't bad,as the body count rises and they weave their blood-thirsty path to victory.However,it's never as awe-inspiring or fun as it could have been.You can see the ending coming before it arrives,yet the plot somehow still manages to just about be engaging.But where the film really comes to life is in the F/X and creature design department.The Mother-Alien (funnily enough,a toy I remember owning as a child!) is fantastic and the Predator creature designs are nothing to sniff at either.Overall,this isn't a film that manages to blow you away or excite you as much as it ideally could (or even should!) have,but it's an engaging enough joint venture for two of sci-fi horror's most memorable and endearing characters.***",Null,1,2,21 October 2004
No Country for Old Men," The Coens deliver a great film the way only they can
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningLlewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across some dead Mexicans, a huge stash of heroin and a load of cash. He gives in to temptation, and takes the cash, vaguely aware there may be some payback for it. He finds himself being pursued by the psychotic Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who leaves a trail of blood and destruction behind him. On both their trails is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy. On the verge of retirement, Bell really is starting to lose his faith with people and the world.Although they're regarded as gold by film lovers in general, I can only remember one film of the Coens I thought was great, and that was the snow drenched Fargo. I'm sure there are many others, I've just not bothered to see them, but I have just seen this new one that makes me further of the persuasion that maybe I should see some more of their older ones. The brothers have crafted a film based around atmosphere, mood and tension, where such little things as a sweet wrapper unfolding, a tracking device beeping or a telephone ringing are given new dimensions. Some, less refined, viewers might find the film 'boring' but quite simply they don't know enough about film or what makes it an art form.Getting the style and substance of the film so right, the Coens are also treated to some brilliant performances. Bardem (could have fooled me, I thought he was Robert Downey Jr.???) is the star of the show, as a genuinely scary and unpleasant guy, who takes no nonsense, leaves bloodbaths not bodies and even has to creep people out when he's apparently just joking with them. Jones also shines as the world weary cop, who really does feel like he's about to lose his faith in human will and nature. Rising star Brolin is sadly left to basque in their greatness, alongside supporting stars Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald.Not one for those with the attention span of a knat, then, but for those who truly appreciate films and what makes them an art form, this is highly recommended. *****",10,3,6,7 July 2008
District 9," One of the most original and inspired sci-fi films in ages
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The eyes of the world fall on South Africa when a giant alien spacecraft descends over it. Some of the aliens come down to earth and end up living in the shanty huts, but face prejudice and oppression from some of the earth dwellers. Finally, a giant government agency comes in and tries to forcefully relocate the aliens and in the process gentle, compassionate Agent Van De Mere (Sharlito Copley) swallows some fluid from the alien camp and finds himself morphing into one of them. It is then that he finds out just how corrupt the government are and is forced to go on the run from them...and to try and forge an allegiance with the very beings he had previously been trying to help get rid of.With it's sorry history of apartheid and segregation, South Africa is a clever backdrop to set this off beat sci-fi tale against, and with aliens and humans in place of blacks and whites. Told in a post modernist, mock documentary style, which seems to be the style these days, District 9 is an inspired and original science fiction story in a day and age where the genre is dying on it's lozzells. The camera lens and style of filming create the perfect sense of atmosphere and tension.Neill Blomkamp and Peter Robert Garber are the directors at the helm, but this is a Peter Jackson production and the special effects genius is in his element on a doubtlessly smaller budget than most of the other projects he's involved in, delivering some impressive 'prawn' prosphetics and make up. The aliens are given really sweet, gentle, puppy dog faces which makes you end up feeling for them even more. In the most important role, Copley similarly delivers an earnest, rootable hero, speaking in South African, that most weird of dialects that is a mix of cockney and Australian, but sounds more Irish coming from his mouth! Destined to become a cult classic, this is a unanimously pleasing effort for Jackson Productions (the same can't be said for the Lord of the Rings films!) *****",10,1,4,18 April 2010
Mamma Mia!," Utter torture, but at least you can say you've seen it
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Any plot that is simply an excuse for a bunch of overpaid actors to sing bloody Abba songs really doesn't deserve any great detail off me but here's mine...twenty year old Sophie (Amanda Syfried) is about to get married and wants her real father to give her away and so sends letters off to three different men, including Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard.) Going on Jeremy Kyle and getting a DNA test would have saved everyone (especially the audience!) a lot of bother but instead they travel from Sweden, London and New York to the home of Sophie's mother Donna (Meryl Streep) on a Greek/cypriot? island and catch up on old times, all to a medley of none stop Abba tunes.I had no intention of seeing Mamma Mia! From the outset, I could see it wouldn't be my type of film, as would be expected from one that appears to be aimed at women. But hey, guess what, it's gone and become the most successful film of the year and it's never nice to feel the odd one out. It's been very manipulative, drawing in a largely older audience with a strong affinity for Abba and their music, knocking far more deserving films (i.e. The Dark Knight) from their rightful box office top spot. But there you go. At times it got on my nerves so much I just wished Sweeney Todd would come along and slash all their smiley, sappy throats ('...think you can do musicals, huh? Well here's your old friend Sweeeney!!!') another film that's had attention diverted from it as top musical of the year.But maybe I'm just in a grumpy mood. There is an undeniable feel good factor to it, as well as the (unintentional?) hilarity of 007 himself Brosnan (easily the most out of place performer here) giving his rendition of SOS. And surely the sing along version's even better? **",4,3,7,25 December 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Captures all the mood and atmosphere of the good western, but not always engaging
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the early days of motion pictures, the western was at the pinnacle of it's game, being the landmark of American cinema and capturing the idyllic image of the 'cowboy' as the fearless hero with a no nonsense attitude and a grizzled image, giving the world the first 'big screen hero' in the shape of John Wayne...and this would last through out the years as those like Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood would take over the template and keep the legend alive. Nowadays, it's a rarity...although films like the re-make of 3:10 to Yuma and Ed Harris's Appaloosa do come by, in modern times it's a defining genre of cinema that's pretty much been allowed to fall by the wayside. Andrew Dominik's mouthful of a title is an attempt to revive this type of film is a lengthy, ambitious and fairly heavy piece that has all the right ingredients at hand in terms of mood, atmosphere and slow, lingering tension that somehow fixate our eyes on the main characters...but fails to really craft a truly absorbing or coherent story that is a problem when it's demanding your attention for so long.As deep and as dim as it is, it's trying to engage you more in the characters than the plot, and so it befalls the performers to bring the show to life. In the lead role as the main titular character, Brad Pitt has the job of bringing the fire and madness inside James's soul to life, as he displays signs of losing control and going completely over the edge, yet still manages to remain the most elusive outlaw in the United States. As the second titular character, as the young pretender Ford, Casey Affleck shows early signs of promise before his break through role in brother Ben's Gone Baby Gone, as the hopelessly infatuated young man who can't spin a line to any of James's associates and can never prove himself as a true man. Both are well cast, and are complimented by quite a supporting cast including Sam Rockwell, Sam Shepard, Jeremy Renner and female players in the shape of Mary Louise Parker and Brooklyn Proulx.It's a film that opened to great critical acclaim but limited box office success...the reason may be it had all the right elements in place, but couldn't use them in the right way to engage it's audience. In a day and age when this genre has far less gravitas, this is a deadly mistake to make. ***",7,0,1,16 May 2010

Toy Story 4," A risky gamble, but pays off in the end
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWoody and the gang are back, and their new owner Bonnie is preparing for her first day at Kindergarten. By a freak accident, Woody gets taken with her to Kindergarten, where Bonnie ends up creating a toy of her own- Forkie, made with a discarded plastic fork and some accessories. When Forkie gets separated from Bonnie, and the little girl gets upset without her favourite toy, Woody, driven by a sense of duty to keep his owner happy, embarks on a desperate mission to find him, leading him into all sorts of triumpths and trevails.Toy Story 3, the last Toy Story film, was already released over ten years after the previous film in 2010, which shows how it was already seen as a sure fire box office success even back then, and therefore safe to regurgitate after such a long lapse since the last one. Toy Story 4 emerges with less (but not much!) of a time gap in the shape of nine years since that film, but once again there's the feeling of the studios being in desperate need of something safe and easy to make a quick buck. And, that aside, three is the magic number. Things were wrapped up nicely that time around, with the grown up Andy going off to college, and handing his beloved childhood toys over to the little girl Bonnie, who is the focus of their attention here.And yet, from this new stand point, director Josh Cooley, making his feature length debut, still manages to evoke the magic and charm that made the first three such successes, albeit from a different stand point. While not featuring massively in the film, Bonnie's attachment to her toys (especially the one she created!), and their reciprocated affection makes for as endearing a film as any of the others, with Woody's devine sense of duty and loyalty to his owner shining through. Buzz fits in nicely in a background role, as contrasting and wise cracking a sidekick as ever to his mismatched counterpart.There is a feeling of pushing the boat out too far, tarnishing the originality and magic, certainly of the first two, and even the third film, but Cooley proves them totally unfounded, creating a production that, certainly for the most part, maintains the magic and excitement of the last few, whilst keeping the same high standard of spellbinding animation. Nobody could rule out a fifth film, but on the basis of this, I'd at least give it a go first. ****",9,5,8,4 September 2019
Batman Begins," Batman for a new generation
","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has travelled the world, studying the causes of crime. Having become a common thief in China, he has wound up in a tough prison, scrapping with bigger, tougher thieves, only to be recruited from inside by the mysterious Ducard (Liam Neeson) who trains him in the way of the ninja to focus his energies in a more positive way. However, he soon learns he doesn't have it in him to live their way and goes on the run. Arriving back in Gotham City, which has become over-run with crime and corruption, he becomes the legendary Batman and puts his skills to the ultimate test. However, old adversaries from his past soon arrive with a plan to pollute the water of the city that he must thwart.I remember ten years ago when Batman Forever was released and the fever that whipped up (even though I considered it to be a rather poor film in the end.) This regeneration of the franchise seems to be a mix of the dark elements from the first two original movies and the lighter tones from the last two, with a new director in the shape of Christopher Nolan, whose previous work, Insomnia and Memento I've thoroughly enjoyed.Going back to the plot summary above, I don't think I've done it much justice and described everything it's actually about (not least of which being the significant amount of characters involved!) That's partly a failing on my part, and partly I feel the first movie in the new series may have been a bit overly-ambitious and tried to cram too much stuff into the first instalment. I guess only you can ultimately decide that...Like the new Star Wars movies, this new Batman series starts the new series off before the original films even began. I get the feeling the new Batman franchise is going to shape up to be a bit more enjoyable than the new SW films, but then if you'd have asked me how I thought the new SW films were going to plan out six years ago when I reviewed The Phantom Menace, I might have thought differently.It may have just been the auditorium I watched it in, but there did seem to be an exceptionally large amount of loud bangs and thuds in the film that might be off-putting for someone of a , er, nervous dis-position. Also, Bale's Batman suit isn't as impressive as those worn by Keaton, Kilmer and the like...it's too squibby and rubbery as opposed to the more sturdier ones worn in the other films.On the performances front, in the lead role, Bale has a quiet, mesmerizing aura to him as Wayne (which weirdly disappears and becomes really aggressive when playing Batman himself!) and Michael Caine is well cast as Alfred the Butler. Neeson is sharp and scary in the lead bad guy role, but as the love interest, Katie Holmes is overly-wholesome and not completely convincing (but very attractive.) But supporting players Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson and even video favourite Rutger Hauer (ebbing towards making an unexpected but welcome and encouraging big screen come-back with this and his appearance in the recent Sin City) are as reliable as ever.It may be a bit too much on the first go, but second time round, Batman Begins really heralds Batman for a new era. ****",9,0,0,27 June 2005

Still, with high stakes and personal vengeance to take care of, him and his team mount their own mission to track down terrorist leader Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nvqvist) before he obtains the launch codes and initiates a catastrophe.In spite of not being a massive fan of the series, the fourth Mission: Impossible film is the only one so far I haven't seen at the cinema, where it's true spectacle for the type of film it is can be fully appreciated. Yes, something did feel lost from it watching it on DVD, even on a flat screen TV with surround sound, something you could only really get in an auditorium with a big bucket of pop corn in your hand.This time round, directing duties fall on the shoulders of Brad Bird, who before was behind only a list of kids films, including Disney favourites The Incredibles and Ratatouille, as well as the 1999 Warner Brothers effort The Iron Giant, not to mention one or two episodes of The Simpsons. In what appears to be his first adult themed effort, he rarely lets up on the spectacle (to wit, Cruise scaling the tallest building in the world in Dubai with a pair of magnetic gloves that flash blue when okay and red when you're fu*ked) while spinning a story that feels a bit over complicated, failing to get from point a to point b like you should in these films.Still, it's no less the sum of it's parts than the last three films, with a lively supporting cast including Jeremy Renner and Brit actors Simon Pegg and Tom Wilkinson, a mix of old time and up coming that shows a long running franchise could still have some life in it. ***",7,0,1,2 October 2012

City of God," A thoroughly absorbing, powerful and unforgettable movie experience
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A film set in Rio De Janeiro's infamous City of God, an area in which combat photographer's fear to tread, police rarely go and residents are lucky if they live to the age of twenty. The film opens in the 1960s, where a young Rocket, who is too scared of being killed or hurt to become a gang member, dreams of becoming a photographer later in life. In the meantime, a street gang which includes his older brother, rules the streets, holding up gas trucks and stores. But this doesn't provide enough money, so his gang, along with a young boy named L'il Dice, engineer a raid on a fancy hotel, planning to make off with a good deal of cash but not to kill any one. This plan, of course, goes pear shaped and in the aftermath, the police launch a major sweep on the slum to catch the culprits. But things really heat up when Rocket's older brother has an affair with the wife of a local man and, when it is discovered, is forced to flee the slum and, unfortunately, he doesn't make it out alive.A decade later, Rocket is now older and a bit more guided. But the terror of the street gangs continues, with one drug dealing (where the real money is) gang lead by the irredeemable L'il Ze, who used to be the boy L'il Dice, and his best friend from childhood Benny, and another, ruthless but more rounded gang of drug dealers lead by Carrot. But when L'il Ze gang rapes the girlfriend and kills the brother of a local pacifist, everything culminates into a brutal final confrontation between all the gangs dominating Rio de Janeiro before the cycle of violence starts up all over again.Brazil's Rio De Janeiro is probably one of the first places that springs to mind whenever anyone mentions the subject of gangs and gang violence. And with good reason since it is certainly one of the worst, with such shocking statistics as mentioned above. And, in spanning three decades of trouble and strife in the area, film maker Fernando Meirelles has crafted one of the most extremely thorough, unbelievably engrossing and totally satisfying films you are likely to see, a searing, powerful and at times very disturbing examination of characters caught up in the violence. We have a character, warped and twisted from a young age (who may well have become as bad as he does if he was raised in Swindon instead of Rio) and who grows up to show no signs of changing down his road of evil (managing one or two distressing scenes along with it.) Another character part of the cycle of death and violence but who still manages to come off as a nice, affable guy all the same but who's fate is sealed when he tries to find a way out. Another character who, even on the path of retribution, tries to stay ethical and remain a good person but who circumstances dictate ends up becoming as bad as those he's going after. And one last character whose own weariness of violence and single ambition is probably what keeps him on the straight and narrow till the end and produces probably the only happy ending in the film. Other than that, we finish on a scene of a group of young street orphans roaming the war-torn streets, talking about how the money's not in robberies but drugs, and that the mostly tragic events we've just seen are about to repeat themselves in a film that could be exactly the same.IMDb users generally know what they're talking about, and they've voted a most satisfying film in at #16, a mostly downbeat and disturbing but still sweeping, soaring and utterly absorbing account of a place where misery and bloodshed is doomed to continue, which sweeps by at just over two hours (even quicker on second viewing) and also boasts a fine soundtrack to boot (including the ultimate one hit wonder Kung Fu Fighting.) What film-making is all about. *****",10,3,6,8 May 2006
Legend," Decent and well made enough, but with noticeable flaws present
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A biopic of the most infamous gangsters ever to hail from the East End of London, Ronnie and Reggie Kray (both played by Tom Hardy), who have transcended East London folklore more than any other. Opening in the early '60s, the film charts Reggie's courting of the innocuous Frances (Emily Browning), Ronnie dealing with his homosexuality in less permissive times, as well as being declared insane, and the brothers takeover of the Richardson clans grip on the local crime scene. But with dogged Detective Read (Christopher Eccleston) on their backs, and their own destructive, excessive personalities driving them to their own demise, it all leads to a shocking, brutal end for both of them respectively.It's surprising, given the popularity of the British crime thriller and, as I already stated, the unrivalled iconic status the Kray twins have in British folklore, that since they were at the height of their infamy in the '60s, only two films have been made about their exploits, in spite of the no doubt countless crime biographies and television documentaries that must have been shown about them. The '90s film, a much smaller scale affair, had the similar conundrum of casting two actors who looked alike enough to be twins, and ended up with the Kemp brothers, who at the time were still able to ride on their popularity as being part of the recently split up Spandau Ballet. Here, being one actor playing two roles, Hardy, as acclaimed a performer as he is, risks looking silly, adopting an on screen filming style made most famous by Jean Claude Van Damme in Double Impact. But if you can get over this, the film still has much to recommend it.Telling a true life story, and not to mention a particularly brutal and savage one, inevitably the film will contain more than its fair share of violence, which director Brian Helgeland will quite rightly say is essential to tell the story. But the trick is to show it on screen without 'glamorizing' it, which, sadly, at times, Helgeland fails to do. A particularly unflinching moment is during a hammer wielding pub attack, where the brothers (or one of them, anyway) take out some of their competitors, only set to a rock n' roll backdrop which cheers along what any decent person would find unsettling. The film in general seems consistently unsure of the tone it wants to adopt, flitting between drama, romantic, and even comedy, which it matches with the plot, which lacks any real narrative structure and just plods along, showing various antics from the Krays life without really going anywhere.Since his double performance is the talking point, all eyes fall on Hardy, who undoubtedly fits the roles better than anyone. He creates more of an impression with Ronnie, whose drawling, rambling and softly threatening persona make him distinctive in the same way as Hardy's Bane was from The Dark Knight Rises. As Reggie, he portrays a swaggering, posturing villain to whom appearance is everything, but in all honesty no different to your standard villain from such a film. I can't think of it as any better or worse than the 1991 film when the chips are down, to be honest, and it would be nice if something more structured and smooth could come along to depict the antics of these most timeless and unduly worshipped of real life villains. ***",7,13,21,11 October 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Works if you just try and enjoy it as one long visual spectacle, without looking at anything else
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe mighty, evil Thanos (Josh Brolin) is in need of one more 'infinity stone' to place on his giant glove in order to control the universe. In New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is approached by Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his ally Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) in order that they reunite to battle him, and gets treated to a big demonstration of his powers in a massive city battle, during which young buck Peter Parker (Tom Holland) makes his presence known as his Spider-Man alter ego. As the old gang reunite, they cross paths with Skylord (Chris Pratt) and his gang...After an endless stream of singular Marvel universe entries where individual characters have faced their battles and revealed their back stories, directors The Russo Brothers have here decided the next logical step is to create a big, all out spectacle of a film, where the stand alone characters meet up with the Guardians of the Galaxy characters, and combine their powers to take down an epic super villain. It's no doubt something the die hard fans of the series will have been looking forward to, and will have been on the cards for a while given the huge box office takings. But, while it's as big a visual splendour as all the others, in the end it sadly works best only on a superficial level.The central plot is paper thin, and not nearly strong enough to sustain a movie of its length and scope. Not only that, it's also overly reliant on the viewer having an extensive knowledge of all the previous films, rendering it a benign mystery to anyone who's casually chosen to see it. The original Avengers Assemble film (now unbelievably over five years old!) managed to get all the featured characters to gel together well, but this seems over eager to examine all the characters back story and relationships with others, and all together here, there's too much to take in, in a plot that goes nowhere and drags on for far too long.Overlong, overblown and over-ambitious, this will end up over-whelming even the most ardent Marvel fan. It just about manages to succeed by being as colourful and visually exciting as all the rest, with dazzling special effects and thrill a minute action sequences. But this, sadly, is pretty much the best it has to offer. ***",7,1,3,6 May 2018
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Hard to see what all the fuss is about
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsCrouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon is heading in the direction of becoming possibly the most successful foreign language film ever.At No.7 in the top IMDB movies,and nominated in many oscar categories,it has certainly taken the overseas film market by storm.All this,plus the promise of exciting martial arts action,is enough to entice the punter in.Until you notice another factor about the film :it's arthouse style.Good reviews off the professional critics send the public hurling in flocks to see it.But for the common man,here's a review to set the records straight.None of the actors involved are even known over here,and their muted performances are very hard to acknowledge.Ang Lee isn't directing an action movie.The Ice Storm wasn't an action film.This is meant to be an insight into the morals and values of 19th Century China,with martial arts being in place for the ideals of revenge,grace and defence.But the story itself is very hard to unscramble,and stretches out,at 2 hours,beyond the limit such a story could muster.90 minutes would have been a more suitable time frame.And the action itself looks rather cheap and unconvincing.Why on earth were the characters able to fly everywhere?Overall,a very strange movie,and hard to understand the warrant of such merit.**",Null,0,1,24 February 2001
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A little empty throughout, but builds up to a satisfying climax
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningHollywood, 1969. As the decade draws to a close, so to is the career of Rick Dalton (Leonardo Di Caprio), a faded star of westerns who's starting to realise his time is up. He now meanders aimlessly around, with his stunt double and best friend Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), but the pair are about to get a surprise, when Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), the wife of Roman Polanski, moves in next door to Rick, setting all of them on a dark and dangerous collision course with the Manson cult.And so, Quentin Tarantino rolls around with his ninth film. After a couple of attempts to resurge the western genre, in his signature gory way, here he returns to more familiar ground, keeping the western element in the background, with the lead character being a faded western actor. Returning, as always, with familiar faces he's worked with before, the familiar rapport and effective working partnership (along with new addition Robbie) work well in this slightly over indulgent but ultimately worthwhile romp.A director who is distinctively more driven by dialogue than plot, at times the story here feels as aimless as it's lead character's predicament, meandering along without much direction, and not really solid enough to sustain a nearly three hour length. It is driven along by a creepy sense of atmosphere, given the grisly build up to the real life events it's alluding to, along with, of course, the standard smooth dialogue and cool, funky soundtrack, but pays off with some darkly humourous shenaningans , involving some of the trademark Tarantino violence, which may explain the 18 certificate here.It doesn't have the strongest foundation to build on, and does require your patience a bit, but it does work in the end, albeit maybe not as well as it could have, guided along by a cool, attractive cast who fit the shoes of who they're playing fine, and bravely take creative licence with such sensitive true life events. ***",7,1,3,19 August 2019
Behind The Candelabra," Well made, moving dramatisation of a very famous man
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningScott Thorsen (Matt Damon) was a young, naive farm boy who worked on movie sets, before he was introduced one night to entertainment giant Liberace (Michael Douglas) after a show, and became his lover, spending the late 70's and early 80's in his life before he was tumultuously thrown out, only to get his own back with a tell all book about their time together, before a brief reconciliation before Liberace's death in 1987.Steven Soderbergh's latest high profile biopic, which essentially serves as a temporary resurrection of a man who was once as big as Elvis or Sinatra, has managed to prove controversial for any number of reasons, not least of which was the casting of Matt Damon as a young man of eighteen, despite being 42 years of age himself. The first high point the movie strikes is pulling off the incredible feat of genuinely managing to make Damon look this age, a real masterstroke from the make up/lighting department. All the same, in a still largely conservative America, the film was deemed 'too gay' for mainstream cinema goers, despite it's massive Oscar potential, and only managed to make it as a HBO TV movie, and doesn't manage to hide it's production values quite so convincingly. Some of the greatest sadness's are caused by a nonsense, since it's ridiculous to think most Americans wouldn't be forward thinking enough to enjoy this lavish, touching and highly impressive true life story.In the main roles, Douglas and Damon very bravely cast aside their tough guy personas to portray the original Elton John and David Furnish, only in a day and age where this kind of relationship had to be kept completely behind the scenes rather than plastered all over the front page of OK! Magazine, and it's testament that they manage to play them so well. As Liberace, Douglas captures the gay mannerisms and styles perfectly, showcasing a flamboyant character it seems inconceivable anyone could doubt was gay nowadays. He evokes a gentle innocence and dislike of confrontation, juxtaposed with a thin line between whether he has genuine love for Scott or a filthy, perverted lust. Meanwhile, Damon is explosive as the emotionally volatile, needy, unworldly wise Scott, who is never completely able to lose his affection for Liberace despite the worst treatment. Like a dog, the worse he's treated, the more he loves, though with this in mind it still doesn't take away from a deeply tender and heart-breaking ending.This isn't the type of movie I'd go out my way to see, but with nothing else on and being quite a fan of the lead star, I gave it a go and think I spent my time well. If the lead stars don't provide enough dramatic dynamism for you, there's still a lively supporting cast including Rob Lowe, Dan Ackroyd and Scott Bakula to ensure the characters working in the background for the main characters also get their less pivotal, but still highly relevant, inclusion. ****",9,1,3,13 July 2013
Gone Girl," Doesn't do much at first, but refuses to let you go until you've seen it's inventiveness
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNick Dunne (Ben Affleck) is a men's magazine journalist who's married to Amy (Rosamund Pike), the author of some successful children's novels. But beneath the surface, their marriage hides a lot of murky secrets and sordid lies. Shortly after their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick reports that Amy has gone missing. There then follows a well publicized appeal to help find where she's gone, but Nick's strange behaviour and lack of emotion make others believe he's got something to hide. But the truth is far more sinister and unbelievable than anyone could have imagined.Having previously delivered another adaptation of a successful novel, in the shape of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, here David Fincher puts his hand to another novel that has enjoyed a fair bit of critical and commercial success, and presents a film with a very similar, almost identical sense of style, mood and tone, not to mention the same testing length stretching at just over two and a half hours. It's a bold, experimental effort, that takes the murder mystery genre and attempts to take it in new directions and explore new avenues and possibilities with it, that doesn't grip you much at first, but somehow mellows your patience and gets you to stick with it and go with it's flow ,as it twists and turns in all it's unexpected and baffling turnings.At first, Affleck's detached performance, not one of his more explosive ones, and the lack of development with the married pair doesn't promise a film that's going to hold your attention for much over half an hour, much less over five times that amount, and the early warning signs of the modern curse of 'back story', where we learn of Nick and Amy's early courtship and such, don't bode that well. But the film simply holds your attention through out by refusing to follow the rules of what went before it, serving more prominently as an examination of media hysteria, witch hunting, trial by media, being guilty until proved innocent and how the vacuous culture we live in makes the true victims the real criminals. At various junctures, it promises to end, only to strike it's fiercest blow in the middle with an explosively revealing twist that makes it stand out. From here, it can only get more shocking.Throughout, the film also benefits from a superb score, a drained, spaced out soundtrack that gives a Fincher film it's signature style. Fans of TGWTDT will certainly not be disappointed, while everyone else can experience a flawed but visceral experience unlike any other. ****",9,0,7,11 November 2014
Django Unchained," Lumbering, way overlong Tarantino indulgence fest
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDjango (Jamie Foxx) is a slave in a chain gang, who happens upon a chance for freedom when the eccentric Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) sets him free and leads him along for his own personal reasons. But Django has his own mission to be reunited with his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who he learns is being held as a slave at a plantation owned by the mean hearted Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio.)Taking inspiration once again from his love of all things ultra violent, Quentin Tarantino here turns his attention to his appreciation of blood splattered spaghetti westerns from the 60's and 70's, with this ultra lengthy homage to another little known entry from the genre. Always finding new ways to be controversial, this time around his new film caused outrage among a vested minority with it's excessive use of the racial term 'nigger', even by other black characters. Although the term is casually thrown around through out the course of the script, it never feels gratuitous in any way, and probably does serve as an accurate reflection of the culture and attitude back then, and could even serve to highlight how the word could have deeper connatations of how blacks used it towards certain other blacks rather than just whites against blacks.For the most part, the film seems on a desperate mission to bore you to death, lumbering along as it does at it's outrageously over-bearing nearly three hour running time, with long periods of no action among it's trade mark Tarantino usage of lengthy, lingering dialogue and exposition. It just fails to strike the balance right, and comes off feeling like a self indulgent love fest to one man's own passions. This on it's own won't endear it to the target demographic, and so it's left to more superficial things to save the day. When the action does heat up, more towards the end, it's appropriately blood splattered and ultra crazy, and it's carried along by a lively soundtrack blending more old school western tunes with modern hip hop beats, to maybe strike a balance between the generations, what with westerns being an old genre enjoying a resurgence.It ultimately falls on the cast to carry something striving to be this epic, and so it is a blessing that the cast are so dynamic. In the lead, Foxx embodies the mean, moody manner of the lonesome cowboy, a knock in the teeth to the days when having a black lead in something like this would have been thought inconceivable, while following on from his involvement in Tarantino's last Inglorious Basterds, Waltz is on fine form here as a mysterious, eccentric man whose motivations and behaviour are never quite made clear. But it's Di Caprio as the villain who steals the show, investing the role as he always does with his intensity and dynamism, bending it well in to an evil role, served well with support from Samuel L. Jackson as an elderly sell out black worker who sees himself as a cut above the food chain. All these great performances, though, would have been better served in something more restrained and less illustrious. ***",7,0,1,7 July 2013
Get Out," Original, impressive horror that emerges as a nice surprise
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningChris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are a mixed race couple, who are travelling to meet Rose's parents, Missy (Catherine Keener) and Dean (Bradley Whitford), a retired neuro-surgeon, for the weekend. While they seem fairly nice, Chris can't help but pick up loads of subtle little knocks at his African American heritage (most notably, learning Dean's grandfather was robbed of his dream at the 1936 Olympics by Jesse Owens.) One night, Missy puts Chris under a teacup induced hypnotic trance, and from there he finds himself plunged into a series of increasingly twisted events, from which he ends up battling for survival.The horror genre is in a pretty desperate state of affairs at the moment, certainly not a patch on its heyday twenty/thirty years ago. When they're not remaking old classics, they're just making films that rely on cheap jump scares in place of anything that really gets under your skin. And so, it's a really nice surprise when something like Get Out comes along, which gives you faith that there's still life in the old dog yet. First time director Jordan Peele gets back to basics with what traditionally made the genre so great, in a film that's also from the producers of such hits as Insidious and The Gift.Peele understands that a creepy air of mystery and a foreboding sense of the unknown are far more effective tools than cheap shocks and gore, and what works in Get Out's favour so well is a genuinely intriguing and exciting story that really leaves you wondering what is going on, when it will kick off and how it will all work out. It's brave, as well, tackling the themes of an inter-racial relationship in the modern world, and constructing one of the most paranoid and outlandish reasons for what could be behind it. There's some light and humour, as well, with subtle little digs and nods thrown in that few will be unlikely to pick up on.As a horror fan, this emerges as a genuinely pleasant surprise, and my only regret is that I didn't see it sooner. *****",10,22,44,30 January 2018
Drive," Initially threatens to drown in style, but stick with it and there's a fine pay off
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A man known only as Driver (Ryan Gosling) has a successful career as a Hollywood stunt man and can basically do anything he puts his mind to when it comes to fast cars. But Shannon (Bryan Cranston), an old friend of his, has come in to some money worries and approaches crime boss Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) about using Driver as the getaway in a heist on a pawn shop. With his own money worries after falling for the wife of Standard (Oscar Isaac) who's just come out of prison, he agrees-only to find himself caught in a maze of deception and deceit.Drive found itself the subject of some favourable reviews from a lot of critics, who I expected it to get the brush off from. Before I even started watching it, I knew there'd be a little more to it than what it looked. And indeed, Nicolas Winding Refn has done something quite inspired by taking what is quite a conventional heist story and coating it over in an art-house style flavour, with a clever use of style and an accompanying background soundtrack. The trouble is to begin with, it sort of loses you with this and threatens to become a case of style over substance, and it's true that a bit of patience is required with it, but it all pays off in the end with quite an impressive, brutal thriller that delivers.Cast wise, in the lead, Gosling has a natural, quietly mesmerising presence, even if he can't shake the feeling of being a bit too much of a pretty boy for such a brutal, blood thirsty film, while a supporting cast including Brooks, Carey Mulligan and Ron Perlman manage to be a little more than surplus to requirements. Refn manages not to get too lost in his own pretensions and pulls everything off quite wonderfully.It's a film that could well alienate as many as it draws in, but it deserves to be appreciated on it's own level and seen for the stylistic, violent gem it is. ****",9,2,4,22 May 2012
Insidious," A great atmosphere is let down by everything else being a total mess
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Rose (Reni Lambert) move with their young son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) into a new home. However, after Dalton suffers a fall, his parents find him trapped in a coma he can't seem to break free from. Worse, shortly afterwards, spooky events take place around the house, causing them to relocate again...only for these events to follow them, causing them to face a terrifying truth about their son that will force them to go above their realm of belief to save him.If Insidious does nothing else right (which it doesn't) it does create a terrific, unnerving atmosphere that fits it's status as a horror film perfectly, not only in the opening titles with the jarring, skin crawling soundtrack, but the impressively grey, drained cinematography in the set up that follows, with an impressive use of no sound to hammer this home.Saw director James Wan shows more restraint and ditches the blood/gore excess and concentrates on setting up the ground work for a decent horror picture. Sadly, he fails to create characters we can care about or a story that is in any way engaging, leaving it to degenerate more and more into preposterousness which robs some of the admittedly eerie scenes of their effectiveness.Horror is one of those genres where if it's done right, things work wonders but when it doesn't, it's just a complete mess, which sadly is the case with Insidious. Atmospherically, and even visually, it's perfect, but sadly all the other components fail to come together and despite being a short film, it feels like a big slog to get to the end. *",2,4,8,1 February 2012
The Theory of Everything," A wonderful dramatization, if a little uninvolving
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning At Cambridge University in 1963, young physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is on the road to greatness, and despite his social awkwardness, has even managed to attract the attention of Jane (Felicity Jones), a young female student. Then he is suddenly stricken down with Motor Neurone Disease, leaving him a paralyzed, invalid wreck. The doctors tell him he only has a few years to live, but he and Jane fight the odds and defeat them head on, with Stephen living a full and brilliant life, and becoming one of the most celebrated physicists of all time.Here I am, a year after it came out, finally reviewing the film that may well serve as Redmayne's Taxi Driver, while he's kicked off this year with another film released on New Year's Day, where he's played a trans-gendering artist. A biopic of well known professor Stephen Hawking was a very interesting idea for a film dramatization, given the place he's managed to secure in popular culture over the years for someone from such an unshow-business background (I honestly thought he was genuinely American, given his voice box.) Yet somehow, despite some impressive acting and sweeping production values, The Theory of Everything fails to really sweep you up in the account of Hawking's life. Something...is just missing from the script, some kind of oompth or gravitas that gives the drama the real motivating kick that it needs to be really amazing. Somehow, you're just not as embroiled in the trials and tribulations of his life as you could have been. It's one of those films where everything is aesthetically fine, but no real magic spins off.Still, Redmayne deserves his recognition, and it could have been a far worse attempt to document this most unique and amazing of men. ***",7,1,2,4 January 2016
2012," The effects are better than ever, everything else is as laughable as before
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Serious film connoisseurs will be familiar with Roland Emmerich and the type of epic, big budget, effects laden blockbuster films he specialises in. They never fail to impress with the 'wow' factor, from the alien spacecraft towering over the White House in Independence Day, to the world freezing over in The Day After Tomorrow. His latest effort focuses on the Ancient Mayan prediction that the world will end in the titular year, when the earth splits open and sinks under a tonne of water. The focus falls on errant father and failed author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) who's left to save his estranged wife and children and the new man in their lives when the disaster erupts. Meanwhile, government researcher Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has returned from India with some unsettling news for those in power, which riles Chief of Staff Carl Anhauser (Oliver Platt) who first doubts the severity of the threat before becoming a bureaucratic fascist when deciding who gets space in the bunkers to survive. All the while, President Wilson (Danny Glover) tries to lead his people to a noble victory.There's a selection of decent supporting players here too, including Amanda Peet as Curtis's disappointed, stern ex wife, Thandie Newton as a conscientious member of the administration and Woody Harrelson in a brief role as a crazy sounding guy warning of impending doom. Quite a selection of characters in a lengthy, ambitious film that is somewhat overlong, and with not the least flimsy of scripts in the world, that will challenge your attention a little bit. There's just nothing overly outstanding about the film, with the typical characters (the flawed good guy, the conscientious voice of reason, the uncaring bureaucrat, the conspiracy theorist nutter, the good guys and the bad guys, basically) and the usual wild suspensions of disbelief required as the heroes are the only ones miraculously surviving collapsing buildings, engulfing fireballs, shattering fragments and all manner of dangers. A younger person may find it the most incredible film ever made, and in terms of special effects it quite possibly is, but an older, more cynical critic is likely to sit there finding it all rather corny and hard to hold their attention.It's not even jabbing at any social or political subtext (unlike the folly of man causing the end of the earth in The Day After Tomorrow) just feeding off a most likely ludicrous prediction from some ancient people. Those who've seen most of Emmerich's films will know what to expect, but in more cynical times, he needs less throwaway material than this if he's to keep making films on such a big scale. ***",7,1,1,31 May 2010

But he has a bit of a troubled past, with his mother's death at eight years old, his father's subsequent suicide and discovering the body of a blonde woman in a nearby house at around the same time. For his birthday, his wife gets him a book, a detective novel, about a character named Fingerling who is driven mad and commits murder after becoming obsessed with the number twenty-three and all the weird coincidences it has. But the more Walter reads the book, he becomes obsessed with the coincidences between himself and the main character, and starts to worry that he will come to do exactly as he does.Former rubber faced funny man Robin Williams tried his hand at thrillers with the likes of Insomnia, One Hour Photo and The Night Listener. So it's interesting, if nothing else, to see how former rubber faced funnyman Jim Carrey would fare. Even in a serious role, he's still hard to buy and can't quite shake off his funnyman look and delivery. So with a leading man who isn't completely up to scratch, things are already looking down for this psychological thriller outing.The film tries to be a clever, twisty-turny thriller and you certainly have to pay attention to everything going on, but this feels less to do with it being genuinely intelligent and gripping and more to do with it being muddled and confusing, more a sign of director Joel Schumacher crying for help than making a masterpiece.One thing the film does manage to do is make a genuinely interesting point about all the bizarre connections to the number twenty three and incorporate it intelligently into the story. But after a while this starts to get on your nerves more than keep you involved in the story, making you want to think more about the number twenty three bus service than the film. And I thought 13 was the unlucky 'three' number? **",4,1,4,6 July 2008
Ghost Rider," A stylish but completely empty comic book adventure
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Comic books would appear to be such a good commercial investment for film makers they're making them left, right and centre nowadays, even these obscure ones that would be simply too violent or scary to make into family adventures. Yes, comic book enthusiasts may suffer at the taunts of the intolerant and ignorant, with cries of 'nerd' and 'loser', but never doubt they're almost unrivalled appeal to the box office consensus. And so we have Ghost Rider, another obscure Marvel Comics adaptation that made it to the big screen. But while The Punisher managed to be a none stop action thrill ride, this effort sadly derails off course fairly early on and never stops from there.The plot, for what it's worth, has Nicolas Cage as Johnny Blaze, who as a young man was conned by the devil into selling his soul to him, only for his father to die in a freak stunt-gone-wrong at his carnival. Years later, he's still a daredevil only to sell out crowds in Las Vegas rather than country carny folk. But the devil returns (his name's Mephistopheles, by the way, and he's played by Peter Fonda) and calls on a bargain to free his soul. He must use some skills given to him to take care of his son who wants to take over the world. Instead, he uses them to fight evil, seeing into the souls of the wicked and stopping any future crimes. As events build up to a cataclysmic showdown, he tries to rekindle his romance with teenage sweetheart Roxanne (Eva Mendes) who's now a news reporter, and is given advice and guidance by wisely old man The Caretaker (Sam Elliot.) Real life comic book enthusiast Cage was an obvious choice for the role, but turns in what is becoming a typically dour performance that brings nothing to the role whatsoever. Mendes is okay as a feisty love interest, but is really just eye candy, while gravelly voiced legend Elliot is sadly equally as fruitless in the wise old warrior role. The only one who really makes an impression is Fonda as the devil, giving it that devilish charm the role requires but the script fails to lift anything higher because of it.The film itself is slick, stylish and polished enough and had it been ten or maybe even twenty minutes shorter it might have passed as harmless hokum. Unfortunately the result is overlong inanity, with a weak, apathetic plot, a slack script and poor performances that make it an instantly forgettable comic book disaster.Mark Steven Johnson's previous film was the other comic book adventure, called, appropriately enough, Daredevil. This manages to make that seem like, well, The Punisher. *",2,0,0,28 May 2008

But strange dreams force Cyclops to travel to a lakeside retreat where he's been hearing her voice in his dreams. The good doctor has been resurrected- but her presence is about to be exploited by both the forces of good and evil. Meanwhile, a 'cure' has been discovered for the mutant 'disease.' While the forces of Dr Xavier (Patrick Stewart) try to downplay the cure by civilized means, it is cause for the forces of Magneto (Ian McKellen) to resort to their militant means and it draws the forces of good and evil into the ultimate confrontation.As I said in my OLS above, there is ultimately little to see here that you wouldn't have seen in the first two films, that is to say that if you liked them you will probably like this too. Brett Ratner handles his directing duties well, moving things along as well as the first film's director Bryan Singer, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen remain well cast as the old time adversaries, as well as having a lively and colourful supporting cast and things really heat up at the end with a spectacular battle that splits the Golden Gate bridge in two. But it's too easy to sympathize with the villain and thus not feel prepped up for the good guys to serve his comeuppance.As others have said, the title implies that this is going to be the last film in the series. It's always best to go out at three, which I hope this fairly superior comic book series does. ***",7,0,1,13 July 2006
The Lives of Others," Doesn't leave quite the impact you wanted, but still an excellent film that deserves to be seen
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In East Germany, 1984, an era of socialism is in swing and the oppressive government tries to spy on and control the people. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is one of the Stasi's best soldiers and is told to spy on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend. But as he spots their beautiful freedom and love, his own heart becomes melted and he becomes softened against the harsh regeime he serves. But when a close friend of Georg's commits suicide, he writes a subversive article on why the government has been listing suicides as 'self murders' for many years which manages to get published. Wiesler then becomes torn between his duties to his government and his newfound love for this pair.Foreign films, or 'arthouse' films, of course have never received the same kind of publicity and promotion as your average brainless, popcorn munching Hollywood blockbuster. So it was that my first introduction to the existence of The Lives of Others was a glowing review in the DVD section of Empire Magazine (Empire Magazine have said it's brilliant...it must be great!) With all the praise heaped on it, and all the five stars handed out by various other critics/magazines, it's a wonder the film never got it's own billboard in Times Squaire! Well, now I've managed to seek it out and see it for myself, and while it's not a film that's changed my life in any way, I can still say it's an excellent film that deserves to be seen and which you may well want to see again.The film lifts the lid on just how intrusive, controlling and oppressive the East German government was in the early 80s, showing a mentality that hadn't changed much since the days of the Nazis (the stasis just sounding like a fancy new word, really.) But in this environment of oppression and bottled misery, we see a beautiful light shine in the shape of Dreyman's love for his actress girlfriend, which of course the oppressor's want to control right away and which turns into a slow burning tale, that feels a bit boring to start with but if you stick with it and pay attention, soon becomes quite gripping and will have you hooked to the emotionally devastating ending.The performances are spot on, too. Muhe is excellent as the no nonsense, disciplined loyal soldier, not even cracking a smile when his colleagues around him are, whose impossibly cold heart is finally melted when he sees a life he couldn't even have thought of before and Dreyman shines as the creative artist, who still manages to keep his spirit alive even in a world of control and limits, which pays off horribly in the end.Florian Hencknel von Donnersmarck has crafted a film that will not be forgotten quickly. *****",10,1,2,16 April 2008

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Number 14?!?Just shows how badly people get taken in by hype...
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsLuckily,for all you discerning movie-goers out there,Davideo (as you know) sees every piece of cinematic work for what it is.And so let me summarise my thoughts on The Two Towers (an astounding title for a film to get away with for a film released after two planes crashed into two certain towers in New York),the inevitable follow-up to the mega-successful (again,hype) Fellowship of the Ring.Well,what can I possibly say?I thought it was overlong,overblown,pretentious and took itself far too seriously.It was even less enjoyable than the first,which I found to be a major disappointment after all the rave reviews and mass publicity.I mean,I think it says it all when the greatest enjoyment I can honestly say I really derived from it was when,in the over-crowded cinema auditorium I was sitting in,two berks sitting next to me who sounded like they'd just inhaled a mass-amount of the whacky-backy,kept shouting out funny remarks whenever a serious or tense moment was coming up.At one particular moment,I really had to bite my lower lip to keep from really exploding with laughter.Normally,I would almost definitely have beared some inner-grudge against them for being inconsiderate of other movie patrons who'd payed good,hard-earned money to watch the film without any interruptions,but I considered this film to be stuck so far up it's own ass,to be honest,and I'm a little ashamed to admit this....I felt more like cheering them on.I mean,COME ON PEOPLE!!!This is a film in which some of the main characters are a bunch of walking ,talking trees (I guess you could call them really 'wooden' actors) and yet we're all going on as if it were Citizen Kane or something!?!I know there are many fans of the books out there who'd eagerly anticipated the release of the movies for a long time,but please!This type of film is this type of film,and it shouldn't get delusions of grandeur and try to be some sort of Lawrence of Arabia style epic.The frankly unbearable length is made even more patronising by all the actors turning in Shakespeare aspiring performances,especially with such atrocious,unmemorable dialogue.Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Great/White? (whatever) is one such actor,but considering how much his appearance in the film was promoted,it's really amazing how little screen time he occupies.Elijah Wood,Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler all turn in standard performances in what I considered standard roles.People go on about how funny some of the Klingon-like,rubber-faced characters in Star Trek look,but check out some of the ugly critters in this movie.They're a hoot.On the plus front,I suppose the end battle scene is relatively impressive,but overall,I at least for one can see how these meandering,self-important tales were concocted by some bored working bloke in Moseley in the late 19th century who couldn't seem to find anything better to do with his spare time other than stare down a well.**",Null,0,1,26 January 2003
Schindler's List," Extremely rewarding film
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs The true story of Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) a German businessman during World War 2 who saved the lives of around 1100 Jews by creating a use for them as labourers in his factories before moving them to his hometown as a safe refuge from Auswhictz in the closing days of World War 2.I'm not sure quite what Spielberg was trying to accomplish by filming this project in black and white,but if he was trying to add a darker,more authentic tone than the film already had,he has failed.There was colour back in those dark times of the Holocaust,and it would have had a more real edge had it been included (with the exception of a little girl running through a crowd in one scene in a red jacket looking like she'd popped right out of a Butlins advert!)What he's succeeded more in doing is paying homage to those b/w war movies from the late 50s/early 60s,and perhaps added a nice touch of film noir for good measure.As a kid (when I originally saw this film) a film running at nearly three and a quarter hours would have seemed like an eternity,but I must say watching it again today the length did seem to run by comparatively quickly.The film does seem to suffer from a lack of narrative flow,although the actual story remains no less engaging.It is certainly a harrowing account of surely one of the most evil events in human history.We see Jews being treated with less dignity and respect than dogs,and the Nazis certainly put less value on their lives than them.Neeson delivers a commanding central performance as the wartime businessman propelled by his own needs and desires,but offered salvation through his care and concern for the plight of the Jewish people.There's good support,too,from Ralph Fiennes (who would go on to accomplish even bigger and greater things-not including The Avengers!) as the heartless,sadistic Nazi soldier and Ben Kingsley as Schindler's wearisome accountant.Overall,this film doesn't manage to be quite as shocking as it was trying to be by being filmed in black and white (which not everything in life is,anyway!).Senior Spielbergo would go on direct another powerful war film some years later by the name of Saving Private Ryan,which had an unforgettably powerful opening sequence involving the Normandy landings which was filmed in colour and managed to stick in the memory much more prolificly.However,it is gut-wrenching stuff nonetheless and certainly not a film that deserves to be forgotten in a hurry.*****",10,9,13,21 December 2004
The Lion King," An interesting take, but just a bland copy of the original
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs the son of Mustafa (voiced by James Earl Jones), the 'Lion King', the young Simba (voiced by JD McCreary) is destined to take over from him and rule the animal kingdom upon his death, much to the chagrin of his evil uncle Scar (voiced by Chiwetel Ejiofor), who engineers a plot to murder Mustafa, convince Simba he is responsible and banish him away as he falsely ascends the throne. During his time in the wilderness, Simba grows into an adult lion and must return to Pride Rock to confront Scar, who's allowed his villainous cohorts the Hyenas to take over.Although the original Lion King is a Disney classic I hold fond memories of from my childhood, I've taken my time getting round to watching this 'live action reboot' (of which Disney seem to be making their stock in trade at the moment) on the grounds that I wasn't awfully keen on sharing my viewing experience with loads of rowdy kids, and so waited until it had been out a while. Although it felt odd as a grown adult watching a load of talking animals, I tried to put aside my cynicism, and was rewarded with a scene for scene remake, minus the magic.With the exception of James Earl Jones returning as Mustafa, the characters are all voiced by different actors from the original cast, none of whom have the same inflection in their voice that made all of them so memorable before. This isn't helped by the live action animals not having the ability to use their expressions like they did in the animated film. The success of David Attenborough's Planet Earth series shows how fascinating people find real life nature, and so transferring the film into a live action setting was certainly an idea with potential, but none of it is explored here.This is Disney's special way of marking the 25th anniversary of the release of the original film, but while it's visually impressive, it still just amounts to the original film, scene for scene, with a third of the heart and Seth Rogen doing a characteristically crass turn as a farting Pumbaa. Stay at home and watch that instead. **",4,0,0,16 October 2019
The Incredibles," Works for adults just as it works for kids
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Mr Incredible (Craig T Nelson) battles to save the day as a super-hero,with his counterparts Elastagirl (Holly Hunter) and Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson).However,suddenly,following a circulation of bad press whipped up by the media for superheroes,he and his crime-fighting friends become prohibited from performing their everyday noble duties.Many years later,Mr Incredible is married to Elastagirl and they live life together with their two children as a normal suburban family.However,it is a mundane existence for both of them,and,when Mr Incredible is offered the chance to step back into his superhero suit for the good of humanity,he jumps at it.However,the stress call is being called by an old face to him who he had an inadvertent hand in corrupting.Therefore driven by a personal need of responsibility to save the day,Mr Incredible races back into action...Pixar Animation have a wonderful talent for taking animated features that would appear primarily aimed at kids and making them perfectly enjoyable entertainment for adults as well,dating back,as far as I can remember,to 1996's Toy Story.And this latest colourful effort is absolutely no exception.It's very admirable in today's filmic climate,where a U certificate appears as rare as an arora boralis,how they can craft an engaging story with snappy,clever dialogue without resorting to gimmicks such as bad language and gratuitously nasty,Manga style violence.But here,certainly,they have pulled the trick off with definite aplomb.It's just as much fun to watch as an adult as it would be to a kid.It's served well by another wise running time (very short!) and some nice in-jokes (primarily aimed at the recent Spider-Man franchise.)In fact,the movie manages to catch the spit-and-polish of the superhero movie and serve as a simultaneous parody and homage to the genre.Another anomoly for me is sexy animated movie characters,a la Betty Boo,Dr Blight,and Stripperella fits perfectly into this category,with a sexy little strut to her and Hunter's sassy vocals adding sex appeal.Elsewhere,Nelson provides a solid lead and Jackson manages some laughs in the 'comedy-black-guy' role.It's not quite on a par with the brilliant original Toy Story but it beats the most recent effort Finding Nemo and will certainly stay in the memory for awhile after you've seen it.*****",Null,0,4,2 February 2005
The Mist," Another rare successful King adaptation
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is a successful New York commissioned painter who lives a quiet life with his son in a small American town. Following a fierce storm the night before, his new piece is ruined and he is thrown into some turmoil with his neighbour Andre Braugher (Brent Norton) another recluse with NY connections, which are resolved when he offers to drive him to the store. But this turns out to be the worst thing he could have done, as a huge mist appears out of nowhere and everyone in the store finds themselves trapped inside. It soon becomes clear murderous alien invaders are lurking in the thick fog outside and, trapped and couped up together, tensions mount among those in the store, stirred up most by a fanatical religious woman named Mrs Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) whose theories behind their predicament end up causing some to take her side. The voice of reason in a sea of hysteria, David must draw on all his resources and get himself and his son out alive.Give most film makers a script adapted from a Stephen King novel/short story and chances are they'll co*k it up like nobody's business. Give one to Frank Darabont, however, and he seems to have an unusual knack for making them work, from The Shawshank Redemption (one of the greatest films ever made), to The Green Mile and now this effective horror film. Not receiving quite so much press exposure at the time of it's release, it pretty much came and went on it's arrival in cinemas but sometimes it would appear this is the case with the really good films.Once again, this is one of his works I've not got round to reading (not even sure if it's a novel/SS) but in this case, it's no less effective and easy to appreciate as a film on it's own. Darabont, with his style of camera lens, eerie lack of soundtrack and generally effective plotting, has crafted a horror with a creepy sense of atmosphere and impending doom, with a suspenseful main story with plenty of unexpected twists and turns. For the type of film it is, maybe it goes on a bit too long, but Darabont was never one for short and sweet, and sticking with it to the end is your best shot.Jane, a star I've come to associate more with action films, does a much better job than expected of carrying the lead role, delivering a startling emotional out pouring at the end, but the star of the show is Harden as the preachy, twisted, demented religious nut, who manages to twist people's minds more than make them resent her. There's plenty of great support, too, from Laurie Holden (from The Majestic), Braugher, Bill Sadler and Darabont veteran Dan Hedaya. That's not to mention some superb special effects in the shape of the slimy alien creatures, as well as the Del Toro esquire fly things that invade the store at one point.Another King/Darabont smash, you might not be able to see through The Mist but you should definitely try and see it. ****",9,2,5,17 January 2009
Driven," More formula than Formula 1

I Am Legend," Fairly enjoyable but really just a glossier Hollywood version of 28 Days Later
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Scientist Dr Robert Neville (Will Smith) is seemingly the only human survivor of a deadly virus that has wiped out the whole of civilization. But every day he still sends a message over radio frequencies for other survivors, if there are any, to meet him at the highest sunset point in New York City at midday, as well as still desperately trying to find a cure. But when he loses his only companion he goes mad and tries to kill himself and any zombie he can see...only to be drawn into contact with two other survivors, Anna (Alice Braga) and her young son Ethan (Charlie Tahan) and a final, apocalyptic showdown to save mankind.You thought a deserted London looked impressive in 28 Days Later (the film this will inevitably be compared to?) Try a deserted New York city for size. This certainly catches your eye in the opening scenes as some overshots eerily show the Big Apple with no people in total silence which really makes you think. And though I'm sure Smith enjoyed being able to zoom around the city as fast as he liked, I'm planning my first ever trip there next year and I didn't appreciate the surprise of what it had to offer being sort of ruined for me. But I'm sure that was the last thing the producers of the film were thinking about when they made it.Since he's the only thing in it (for the first half of the film, anyway), it might be a good idea to focus on Smith's performance in the film. This is the type of film he does, but this isn't your typical 'blockbuster' film. It isn't driven by special effects, more on eerie silence and imminent threat. And the 15 certificate (which, being a zombie film, it must have got by the skin of it's teeth) bars it being one that will draw in the whole family. He shows his development as an actor here, with a more mature role that requires him to be less showy than he may have used to be. He struggles with some of the more emotional scenes, but a far worse actor could have been doing it. Midway through the film, he's joined by Braga and Tahan as the mother and son pair and this provides a chance for some more tense emotional scenes. Sometimes Smith does wonder into a DVD rental store to talk to some mannequins but it has to be said they are a bit, well, wooden.The zombies themselves do the usual leap out of nowhere/make you jump kind of thing and they're certainly quite loud but they're not that scary when you see 'em up close and personal. The film also suffers some contrived moments in the script that require some huge suspension of disbelief. It's a slick and glossy film that gets by on a neat use of silence and air of threat but, even being a big Hollywood film, it basques in the shadow of homegrown effort 28 Days Later. That film's great style, look and feel sadly make this one, despite not being bad, look half the film it wants to be. ***",7,1,2,30 December 2007
A Quiet Place," Fairly admirable, but ends up coming off as a bit of a send up of itself
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe Abbotts, including pregnant mother Evelyn (Emily Blunt), father Lee (John Krasinski), daughter Regan (Millicent Simmonds) and son Marcus (Noah Jupe) are a small nuclear family living in seclusion after a big disaster has wiped out most of America. Wherever they go, they must travel in total silence, communicating only in a form of sign language they have developed amongst themselves, or else some big, weird spider-like thingees will jump out of nowhere and kill them. Having already lost a son to the monsters, the family must do what they can to survive...I recently read (well, glanced, I really must get round to reading it!) an article entitled: is Horror Dead? It would seem the genre has hit something of a stalemate, both in literature terms and in on screen creativity. It seems new writers and producers are now coming up with the most desperate ideas, as in the case with this high concept offering that plays out well into the half way point in almost total silence, with all dialogue between the characters appearing on screen in subtitles. This idea has been explored before (most notably during the opening of 2001: A Space Odyssey) but here it just comes off as lamentably far fetched and silly.The main problem with this idea of no one speaking, is it affects the film's ability, in the opening part, to truly develop characters you can care about and root for to survive. It does manage to create a reasonably creepy atmosphere and feeling of suspense, in regards to just what these big, bad creatures are that everybody's got to avoid, but when they are revealed, it just emerges as even more ridiculous. Less than two thirds of the way in, the whole silly idea has just become overwhelmingly ripe for parody, and pretty much impossible to take seriously.The thing that niggles you the most is, this is set around modern times America and then slightly into the future, but if Trump isn't going to take any cr*p from ISIS hundreds of miles away, why's he going to take it from some big, ugly spider thingees that like to jump out of nowhere and kill people? Why hasn't he just 'bombed the cr*p out of them?' You know he would. **",4,1,4,22 April 2018
Kick-Ass," No fun, even if you don't take it seriously
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Tired of being a nerd who gets pushed around all the time, Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) takes his love of comic books to new lengths by donning a lame suit and calling himself Kick Ass. Despite proving woefully incompetent when facing real, tough bad guys, he just about manages to maintain a steely resolve- but after a while the assistance of 11 year old superhero prodigy Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) starts to come quite in handy. But Hit Girl's father and superhero father Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) has vengeful issues of his own to deal with and they've all managed to rub the city's top crime boss Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) up the wrong way, as things draw to a brutal, action packed conclusion.In a world of genuine artistic vision, where a lot of directors see their work as a labour of love with which they are genuinely trying to convey something deep and meaningful to the audience, it's great and refreshing to see films that just were not meant to be taken seriously at all. Kick Ass falls slam bang into that category, but somehow still manages to miss it's target by about a mile.It's most notable for being from the scribe of Johnathan Ross's missus Jane Goldman (he couldn't give a fair review!) as well as being co written and directed by Matthew Vaughn, who strangely managed a more fun and easy flowing tone with the darker and more serious Layer Cake. Performances wise, Johnson is adequately geeky and self depreciating as the weedy man turned hero and has sassy support from Moretz in the most controversial role in the film as the foul mouthed, multiple killing child. And in the most surprising role of the film, comic book enthusiast Cage lets his zany persona run wild (as he always does!) but still hasn't notched up a decent film. Strong is a good choice as the lead villain, but he'd have pulled it off better being given darker material than the flimsier stuff he has here. The film pays subtle homage to the likes of True Lies and even has a subtle commentary in a scene towards the end on the modern phenomenon of internet torture and executions.Designed with the sole intention of being disposable fun and p!ssing Middle England off, Kick Ass is wild, self referring and fairly slick...it just isn't much fun. The similarly titled Shoot 'Em Up springs to mind for something more worthy. **",4,41,85,26 April 2010
Unknown," A few quibbles, but generally a fine attempt at a thriller
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife Elizabeth (January Jones) arrive in Berlin for a press conference. Suddenly realising he has left his briefcase at the airport, Harris dashes back off to get it...only to be involved in a traffic accident where he nearly drowns and is saved only by heroic female taxi driver Gina (Diane Kruger.) But when one nightmare ends, another one begins when he goes back to his hotel and finds his wife has no idea who he is, and another man (Aidan Quinn) has assumed his identity. As he goes about trying to make sense of his predicament, he finds he really may not be who he thinks he is and people want him dead.The thriller is a genre that tends to work best when it's pitted with something high concept, maybe something slightly far fetched but with a new angle on the genre formula. Although the stolen identity plot line has been done before (though in nothing that immediately springs to mind) Jaume Collet-Serra's European centred thriller still manages to be an intriguing effort, where you are genuinely, if not quite on the edge of your seat, certainly very interested in finding out how it will develop and what will happen next. Somehow it doesn't quite maintain standards to the end, where, as is the case sometimes, the concept disintegrates and it starts to verge into preposterousness, but the mysterious story at the heart of it all still keeps you hooked and unravels in a way you really don't expect.Performances wise, Neeson has a solid presence as ever in the lead role, his deep, powerful Irish brogue (in the guise of an American accent) carrying him with a natural authority and making him well cast to the role, while as the main female sidekick Kruger takes on an unusually unglamourous role and invests some energy in it (her noble illegal immigrant role perhaps having a leftie political subtext to it.) In other supporting roles, Jones and Quinn have less to do, possibly because of their more limited screen time, while more extended support including the likes of Bruno Ganz, Frank Langella and Sebastian Koch are even more wasted. Still, the solid leads the film has are all it really needs to give it edge.There is this and that you could nit pick about the film, but in this uninspired age, it's encouraging to see a thriller that at least seems to be trying to do something new and take the genre somewhere it hasn't gone before. ***",Null,0,2,10 October 2011
Gran Torino," Not brilliant (#82?!?), but well made enough to warrant merit
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a cynical, grumpy, unfriendly older gentleman whose wife has just died and whose family he has little time or respect for. He has even less time for the hmong family who live next door, with his racist thoughts always simmering to the surface. Things aren't helped when a young boy who lives next door is forced into a gang initiation by trying to steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino car, which fails miserably. When Walt saves the girl next door from being attacked, a truce begins to form between them all and when the boy offers to do chores to make up for what he tried to do, it sets him and Walt on a bonding exercise where he teaches him how to approach people and things in life (often not in the most positive of ways!) But the relentless quest of the gang to get the boy to join them threatens to tear this new unity apart.You can't seem to keep Clint down. Acting, screen writing and directing (and now, it would seem, song writing) seem to be in his blood and have no sign of leaving there. We're dealing with a natural movie star here, and one who shows no signs of going down. Also, unsurprisingly, a more old fashioned star who refuses to move with the times. Whose films still seem and feel as though they were made maybe thirty years ago. But who still gets a big fuss made whenever a new film comes out. Gran Torino is the latest such film and, well not as perfect as (some?) seem to think, is still competently made and surprising enough to hold your attention.Despite being presented as more of an action/thriller? kind of film, it emerges really as more of a drama. Unfortunately, some of the writing and dialogue is so clunky and clumsily executed it can come off as a bit of a comedy, most notably by Eastwood himself. His racist slang, insults towards the young boy and funny muted growling whenever you sense he's about to get angry here seem to have you in guffaws of laughter rather than any sense of anticipation or edginess, not to mention the ridiculous scene where he confronts the gang who are about to attack the girl with a make believe gun made from his two fingers. I don't think it was meant to come off this way and it's a failing of the script that it does. And yet, the big man carries it off with such aplomb you can't help but admit it's at least fairly well written and made. Despite a first half that's become bogged down in unintentionally funny and steadily more boring drama, things pick up with some shock dramatic events at the end, some surprising emotional human drama from Clint before a shock ending no one was expecting, before the end credits where you could swear down it's Clint singing the title song (but it's actually Jamie Callum!) Gran Torino is an unremarkable film that mostly doesn't do anything you don't expect it to but Clint is such a pro he carries it all off with enough flair and substance to make it all that bit more enjoyable. ***",7,1,4,1 March 2009

As they go about their duty, dodging gunfire and roadside bombs, the two men engage in a tense power struggle and form an edgy friendship in the chaos and uncertainty of war that tests them to the very limit.With troops (British and American) still operating in the Middle East, the war is always going to be a relevant subject matter for filmic content. Katherine Bigelow's very well received Iraq based action film attempts to provide a first hand perspective into events, not quite in a hand held camera sense but something very similar to it. While it's won many over and even won some awards, for me, as with many films with such praise, it was decidedly hit and miss.While a film might be made to feel very authentic and feel very real, it can never seem to fully separate from Hollywood conventions and always feature some sort of genre cliché or feeling of being staged. That, in spite of everything, was the feel with The Hurt Locker. While it's undoubtedly very well made and seat edgedly tense in parts, for fundamentally succeeding where it set out to, it somehow fails to come off as unmissable, feeling slow and dragging as a story, along with, as I said, not really coming off as what you're seeing is happening right in front of you. It's done very Full Metal Jacket style, though lacking that film's unforgettable characters and sense of soul being lost in the heat of war. Carrying the film in the two lead roles, Renner and Mackie play off each other in their respective parts, each the Yin to the other's Yang and tough, believable characters. They have notable support in the shape of Guy Pearce, Raplh Fiennes and David Morse, all decent enough in far more minor roles.The Hurt Locker is certainly well worth seeing, and maybe for some it will accurately bring the horror and exhilaration of war to life, but for me it couldn't quite separate itself from the conventions of Hollywood enough. ***",7,0,2,15 April 2011

Ex Machina," Too weighed down in scientific exposition, without providing a truly thrilling story
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a young professor, who's been called out at the behest of the eccentric, reclusive Nathan (Oscar Isaac.) Nathan wants Caleb to perform the Turing Test on Ava (Alicia Vikander) to determine whether she has advanced AI. But Ava is not your average person- she's a synthetic cyborg, with human features, and before long, she's engaging in a determined battle of wits with the two men she's holed up in her secluded sanctuary with, the conscientious Caleb desperate to understand her, and the slightly warped Nathan with plans of his own.In recent years, the world has been swept with a new found appreciation for all things scientific, with high tech gadgets becoming must have accessories and the science fiction genre enjoying a popular, more mainstream following among cinema goers in a way you wouldn't have dreamed a few years ago. It's in this new found science fiction realm that Ex Machina, the directorial debut of acclaimed writer Alex Garland, has emerged. A film with a subtle nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey, in it's themes of machines taking over and controlling humans, and with flourishes of that film's style and tone, it's sadly all lost in translation, and bogged down in too much scientific exposition and psychobabble to really engage.There's enormous potential in the film's isolated setting, with only a few central characters to keep our eye on as events progress, and the dynamics between these characters as they reveal their motivations behind what each of them are doing, could have been sparkling, but the film is really just aggressively cerebral, wriggling for the most part in a pretty humourless script, that gets pleasantly broken during an impromptou, incomprehensible disco dancing sequence, where Oliver Cheatham's Get Down Saturday Night suddenly comes blaring out and surprises everyone.Science Fiction is getting readily accepted by a far larger portion of the population these days, no longer just the sole preserve of what people might call 'geeks', but it still has to be presented in a digestible format that those without a PhD might get, and Ex Machina, despite it's few neat touches, just isn't like this. **",4,2,6,19 September 2015
Grudge Match," Another soggy De Niro comedy
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThirty years ago, Henry 'Razor' Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy 'The Kid' McDonner (Robert DeNiro) were on the verge of their penultimate fight that they had been working up to for ages, only for Billy to have an indiscretion with Henry's girlfriend Sally (Kim Basinger) that calls the fight of their lives off. Now both have fallen on hard times, and an unscrupulous promoter (Kevin Hart) spots the potential in giving them both a re-match, but will tensions outside the ring throw a spanner in the works?Sometimes, nothing can sell a movie better than a gimmick. Despite sharing many iconic screen performances between them, DeNiro and Stallone probably still hold most of the affection between them decades on for their respective portrayals of boxers Jake LaMotta and Rocky Balboa, and although the idea would have seemed crazy at the time, now they're both pushing on a bit, what better way to remind a new generation of cinema goers of their boxing legends than to make a new film playing boxers sending up the whole shebang? Sadly, despite the interesting novelty value, Grudge Match emerges as just another soggy, instantly forgettable DeNiro comedy.The man's never seemed able to accept the fact his speciality is playing serious, intense, dramatic roles, and comedy is just not something he possesses a natural ability with. Which is a bigger problem than usual here, as he seems intent on taking centre stage and commandeering the whole show, really laying it on and giving it both barrels, whilst Stallone merely strides along the saddles, aware of what a one trick pony the whole show is. True, he can't really match DeNiro's dramatic expression and capability, but what he isn't showing is really saying a lot more than what he is. Meanwhile, a trio of supporting stars in the shape of Basinger, Hart and Alan Ardin don't get a lot to do, almost criminally under-used.It's just a majorly belated, tragically one note show, depicting something that would never happen in real life and will be of little interest to anyone other than die hard Jake/Rocky devotees, who must be old enough to know better by now. **",4,2,5,17 May 2014
Transformers," Long-awaited but disappointing live action Transformers adventure
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Geeky Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives with his parents and has an impossible crush on a pretty girl at his school named Mikaela (Megan Fox.) But it's not all bad as his father is treating him to his first ever car- unfortunately it's a seemingly junky old Volkswagon. But unbeknownst to Sam, it's just one of the Autobots- good 'transformers', lead by Optimus Prime, that have landed on earth for a showdown with the bad 'transformers'- the decepticons, lead by the evil Megatron, for a showdown that has been brewing for centuries.As soon as I saw those Citroen car adverts with the car that transforms into a dancing robot, I sat there and thought 'if they can do that for an advert, they could surely make a live action movie of the Transformers', most likely my favourite boyhood kids show. Sure, many people cynically shrugged it off as a cheap marketing gimmick to sell toys, but I loved watching the TV shows and collecting the clever toys that transformed into robots from fire engines, cars, tanks, and many other things. And now many years later it's finally here...Unfortunately it's a very flawed film with more going against it than going for it. It gets better towards the end (getting a trend for Summer blockbusters???) but for the first half we have to endure a clunky script, with banal dialogue and a flimsy story that gives hardly any explanation for who's doing what to whom. If Michael Bay's going to make a habit of making these big films that stretch well over two hours (i.e. this, Bad Boys II) then he needs to at least give the script and the plot a bit more zest and vitality than this.You have to wait a while for them, but when the Autobots do arrive on the scene, they're quite a sight to behold. Optimus Prime is very impressive, colourful and transforms marvellously. They also do Jazz, Ironhide, Bumblebee and another one. They surpassed themselves there, as it must have taken a lot of hard work just to bring Optimus to life so brilliantly. The Decepticons are less impressive, though. They're all very grey and all look rather samey. There's not much depth in the Autobots, either, but they're especially lifeless. I mean, Starscream was such a major part of the TV show, and it was always a big part of the story watching the power struggle between him and Megatron for leadership of the Decepticons. Here he's just an insignificant support character who stands there and lets Megatron berate him ('...you disappoint me as always Starscream!!!') which the TV Starscream would never have took.The writers have put a lot of emphasis on humour, too. Not a bad thing, of course, but it does get in the way of the story a little sometimes. It's mostly to do with crude sexual inneuendo as well. The 12A certificate wasn't all down to the violence! It could have been worse, I suppose, but for a large part of it, this just felt like a rather soulless and careless long awaited live action version of a show I used to really love. **",4,13,29,29 July 2007

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsSorry folks,but it's been a disappointing Summer at the box office this year.The trouble this time round has been the sheer lazyness on display in terms of creativity.Proof of this exists in the endless amount of sequels we've been bombarded with.Men in Black stands out ,in retrospect,as the most obvious example of desperation in terms of the Hollywood screen-writing 'hacks' coming up with something to keep the crowds entertained,coming five years after the way,way superior original was released.When the story has basically been recycled from the original (this time with Will Smith mentoring Tommy Lee Jones's character,unlike in the original where Jones mentored Smith,zzzzzzzzzzzzz) it shows even more.Unlike in the original,the chemistry and general banter between Smith and Jones is non-existent,and the plot is really hard to get into,and even harder to care about.And maybe someone thought having a Michael Jackson cameo in it would draw a bigger crowd.But hey,for all this,who knows,maybe Men in Black 3 will be better.Or 4,or 5,or zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.*",Null,0,1,2 August 2002
1917," Mendes truly hits the nail on the head with this wartime thriller
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningApril, 1917. World War One is drawing to a close, but the odds are no less tense. In the trenches, on the Western Front, Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay) are stationed, serving in their unit. Blake finds himself summoned to General Erinmore (Colin Firth) who asks him to choose someone to accompany him on a mission to stop another unit, which includes his brother, from launching an attack, which will benefit the Germans. Selecting Schofield for a seemingly easy mission, the pair find themselves thrust into a terrifying battle for survival.Here, as we are, in the early part of the twenty first century, living in turbulent and unpredictable times, where no one can be certain what will happen or what's around the corner, many of us will carry on our lives, sparing nowhere near as much thought as we should for the terrible sacrifices and hardships that were suffered for us to have the life we have today. And so, renowned director Sam Mendes transports us back over a century, when these events were in full swing, and sweeps us up right in the heart of the horrors of the battlefield, with a unique and trailblazing style that absorbs you in ways you can't imagine.So, yes, more on that ground breaking style. Mendes shoots his feature in one long, continuous take for the duration of the feature, keeping us in the heart of the travails of our lead protagonists, and their inner conflicts, struggles and demons as they embark on their dangerous and uncertain mission. They amble on, stomaching the horrors of the battlefield with as much humour and resilience as they can, their relative calm punctuated by the sudden, cruel loud blast of a mortar shell or elaborately hidden enemy device. Newcomers (or, at least, relative newcomers) Chapman and MacKay in the leads deliver their roles with conviction and power, with solid support from established older co stars such as Firth and Daniel Mays.An accomplished, seasoned (and still fairly young) director applies his talent and professionalism and has delivered one of the most surprising, absorbing and breath taking films of modern times, as well as a brilliant testament to the horrors suffered to give us our freedom. With any justice, it'll sweep the Oscars. *****",10,8,12,14 January 2020

Children of Men," Nice spectacle, but I noticed little else
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Nothing like a science fiction film with an interesting concept and Children of Men certainly has that, if nothing else. Adapted from a novel by PD James and directed by Alfonso Cuaron, we open in a futuristic London with police marshalling the streets, immigrants being rounded up and caged like animals and a devastating fertility crisis drying up the population, making it a worldwide tragedy when the world's youngest man and the hope for humanity's future, an 18 year old soccer player, is killed. In this depressing climate, dejected office worker Theodore Faron (Clive Owen) ambles about just trying to get by in a world gone to pot. But he gets a rude awakening when old flame Julian (Julianne Moore) quite explosively arrives back in his life and propositions him to help her and her rag tag henchmen transport a pregnant immigrant named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) to safety under the noses of the authorities. With no other meaningful purpose in his life, Theodore agrees- but it doesn't go as smoothly as he'd have hoped and no one appears as they seem.The film grabs you with it's interesting concept and bleak depiction of the future. Owen's not an actor, shall we say, who prepped me up when I learned he was in the lead role (as I'm sure may have been the case with others) but he's credible enough here, a far cry from his wooden worst. Moore does the best with her limited screen time and the unfortunately named Ashitey is effective in her role. There's good work from Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Pam Ferris in supporting roles as well. Performances and spectacle wise, there are no complaints with the film. Strangely there's just nothing to make the film truly memorable or one I'd want to see again. The interesting subject matter has evaporated by the end, by which time the film has become a slow and plodding drag which seems to go nowhere. The film bears a similarity with another British film from a few years ago called 28 Days Later. As a futuristic/zombie film, that one worked much better. **",4,17,36,11 October 2006
The Football Factory," It didn't strike me the first time, but I can now see it for the modern classic it is
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In what were still the early noughties, Nick Love sparked what was to be a string of football violence related movies of the decade with this high energy, hard hitting exploration of male culture and the lure of the crowd, and in turn provided star making turns for both himself and lead actor Danny Dyer.From the opening credits, The Football Factory hammers your senses and drags you in for the ride with it's high tempo soundtrack interspersed with the various headlines of the scourge of football hooliganism, a style it will keep up through-out the rest of the film. The film is aiming for your face and brilliantly uses a heavy beat soundtrack to drag it along through-out. It gained more attention for it's controversy because of it's violence and mind blowing amount of bad language than for any stand out performances, in much the same way Alan Clarke's TV drama The Firm did two decades before it.Like Trainspotting, there is no 'plot' as such, it more just follows hooligan Tommy (Dyer) about with his gang as he begins to suffer nightmares and question his means of releasing his pent up energy, whilst a big clash with Millwall looms on the horizon. But this doesn't detract from it's startling, raw intensity and intense delving into the minds of men looking for armies to join. Dyer cemented himself as the Ray Winstone of his generation with his 'cockney geezer' persona, with his own cult film on the same level Winstone gained his notoriety for his role in Scum. Special note must also be made to Frank Harper as Billy Bright, an ageing hooligan who can't grow up or accept he will never be top dog, Roland Manookian as drug addled low life Zeberdee and Dudley Sutton as Old Man Farrell, the closest to a sane, law abiding head among all these repressed hot heads.Yes, the film is filled with mostly undesirable characters who are the kind most of us would want to keep a million miles away from in real life. But only the most faint hearted of us would find their violence too much and only the most weak minded would want to imitate it. As a nosedive into this world and as a study of why they do it, TFF is the best film of it's sort all decade, with the energy, intensity and killer soundtrack to make it accessible to a modern audience. It's only a shame I couldn't appreciate it on as many levels as it deserved the first time I saw it. *****",10,2,2,11 January 2010
Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood hits the nail on the head again
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Hard-faced,hard-bitten boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a man battling his own inner-demons and is not at a time in his life where he wants to go against the routine that he has settled into.So when trailer-trash waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) wonders into his gym one day,eager to become a female boxer (which Frank has never trained before!) he is understandably disconcerted.However,with some gentle persuasion from his only true friend and former boxing champion Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman) and Maggie's consistent determination,he gradually becomes less stuck-in-his-ways and heralds Maggie to championship level,and to the triumpths and tragedies that follow...As is noted in the trivia section,this is no less than Clint's 25th film as director,his 57th film as an actor and his 21st film as a producer.There can be no question that this is a man truly deserving of his lifetime achievement award.It is truly remarkable that,even at the age of 74,Clint's name can still garner a cinema release (even a limited one,as in the case of films like Blood Work and True Crime) as opposed to having slipped into a life of DTV mediocrity.Yet it is also his style that keeps his films distinguished and apart from any other films of this day.In other words,you know an Eastwood film when you see one.This,like a fair few of his previous efforts,is a mature,slow,considerate film that the 2-Fast-2-Furious generation are unlikely to have the patience and attention span to sit through.As a previous reviewer noted,Clint refuses to 'dumb-his-films-down' and cut corners in any way...While you have to admire his longitivity,the fact remains that Eastwood has never been a great emotional actor.There's a scene near the end where he appears to be trying to cry that comes off as terribly unconvincing.Yet he's as great as the grizzled,hard-faced tough guy act as he's ever been,and,even at 74,there were certain scenes where his physical appearance really scared me and made me think I still wouldn't want to mess with him in real life.I suppose the same could be said of his co-star Freeman,but,like Eastwood,he does his thing and provides an engaging narrative voice-over throughout the film.Yet the real star of the show and the deserved Oscar winner is Swank,very good as the feisty,determined,give-it-all-she's-got-girl knowing she can't fail or else succumb to a life of further mediocrity.What will further distance the film from a large proportion of the modern day audience is it's heavy,hard-hitting (forgive the pun!) scenes.It's got a 12A certificate,yet it's doubtful a lot of people that age will have the maturity,or,ridiculous as it seems,even mental responsibility to handle it.It's a gentle,easy-flowing film that shows Eastwood's maturity as a film-maker and star and,in this day and age,is distinctly,discernably Eastwood.*****",Null,4,7,19 February 2005

His heart filled with a wonderful new feeling, he has Santa kidnapped and with his own Santa costume goes back into Christmastown to take his place. But it doesn't quite work out...With all the big hit animation films Pixar bring out nowadays, some may have forgotten this little family film from Touchstone Pictures that came out nearly 15 years ago. With all the wonderful films Pixar bring out now and all the amazing things they can do, it just leaves you feeling that this never got all the appreciation it deserved at the time.This is a wonderfully dark, twisted tale that could only have come from the mind of Tim Burton. He's tried to make a more family themed film with this, using a peculiar type of animation instead of filming it live. They use a similar type in the new Lloyd's TSB ads and it certainly works for the theme of this film.It's more for kids, of course, but grown ups will still appreciate the fine work on display from all involved. Some complained at the time it may have been too scary for kids but there's nothing overly unpleasant here that can't be explained away to young minds.

Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ineffective, unexciting and pretty pointless latest addition to the SW franchise
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFollowing on from the end of The Force Awakens, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has tracked down Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and seeks his training to become a great Jedi master. Meanwhile, the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is scolded for his failure to kill Rey and banished from active duty. Despite his apparent death at the end of the last film, Finn (John Boyega) has survived his encounter with Ren and becomes involved in a mission to sneak aboard a First Order ship and disable a vital component to bring it down.As well as being one of the most enduring franchises, Star Wars is also the one with the most distinctive fan base, the die hards who fill out the sci-fi conventions, and know every character, group and all the general titbits about it. Unless you are one of these dedicated, obsessive fans, which I cannot say I am, then it's just been overkill these last two years, with The Last Jedi marking the third SW related film in that space of time. In the end, I only went to see this one simply because there was nothing else on...and, this time round, I really did think that my time had been wasted.Knowing the loyalty of the fan base, the writers seem glumly aware that the characters (including Princess Leia, marking her final appearance after Carrie Fisher's death last year!) will sell the film more than any compelling story or well written script, and so we have all the main players from the last film in a continuation of events that serves no purpose in expanding the story in any meaningful way. But what's really shocking here is that even the special effects and battle sequences fail to produce any sense of genuine wonderment or spectacle, and leave you as cold and unimpressed as the writing. The majestic wonder of the first three, epic films, which is what flickered whatever faint interest I had in the series in the first place, feels sadly squandered and abused now. I think even hard core SW fans would have to agree that the franchise needs a rest, time to recharge its batteries, or maybe even just call it a day on the big screen and...maybe move to Netflix. **",4,24,32,17 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," A sublime assault on the senses, easily the biggest hit of the summer
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1988, the young Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) has just seen his mother die of cancer and, after rushing out the hospital in a flurry of tears, finds himself abducted in to space. Twenty six years later, he's a space hopping, inter-galactic misfit, with a penchant for '70s soul and Motown and is in possession of a special orb, which is wanted by a distant relation of Jim Carrey's The Mask named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who is planning to use it to betray her maniacal ruler Ronan (Lee Pace) who is planning to overtake the universe. But the orb is also wanted by desperate duo Rocket, a talking raccoon, and Groot, a rather monosyllabic talking tree. However, it turns out none of them are entitled to it and they all find themselves thrown in to the jail house, where they cross paths with the strong, silent Drax (Dave Bautista) who has a personal vendetta against Ronan. Together, they must unite together as one and stop his diabolical plan in it's tracks.Guardians of the Galaxy has undoubtedly been the box office hit of the summer. So much so, that even I, on the last day of it's release, have taken a trip out to give it a glance. While the fanfares had died down slightly, it's interesting to chart how over the course of two months, this grandiose offering has taken the film world by storm, a risky venture as well, in as much as there are no established Marvel characters in the lead roles. But simply from the publicity poster, it inflames the senses, with it's dazzling, colourful array of characters and effects. And this would be a real case of reliably judging a book by it's cover, since the film delivers what it promises, a jaw dropping visual spectacle in every sense of the word.Like the previous Marvel encounter, Avenger's Assemble, this doesn't make the mistake of becoming all style over substance, keeping the film flowing with an easy going humour throughout the film that is resplendent with the characters. Pratt's lead is a naturally buffoonish guy through-out the film, who has a wise cracking personality to match, while Cooper's talking raccoon is unavoidably crazy by it's very nature. As for Groot, he's voiced by Diesel, who just says the same line over and over again, which would probably suit his acting ability in more parts where he just appears as himself, although his character here, in the end reel (and throughout really), provides the film with it's more emotional, touching element. These characters are juxtaposed through-out with the more dynamic, forceful character's, in the shape of Saldana's lizard skinned female heroine and Bautista's hard, no nonsense presence. That's not to mention a supporting cast including the likes of Michael Rooker, Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close and Benicio Del Toro.Word of mouth, at least in part, must spread to make something a hit, and in Guardians case it's that it ticks all the right boxes and there's something to appeal to everyone, a lot of effort has been put in to every part of it and it pays off brilliantly. *****",10,8,14,18 October 2014
The Imitation Game," A strong, stirring central performance is the driving force of this wartime drama
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the early 1950s, in post war Manchester, Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) reports a robbery to the police, but the claim appears to lack any validity. However, he does have an interesting story to tell, regarding his theory on how machines will one day be able to think and work like man. A super machine of his own was behind his own contribution to the wartime effort, where he was the socially awkward maths genius who was the main driving force behind cracking the Nazis Enigma code. However, after the war, Turing found himself persecuted for his homosexuality, eventually being driven to suicide.Many years after the last effort, another film dramatising the events at Bletchley Park that played a, if not the, key role in Britain winning the war has come by, and much like the American offering U-571, there have been some frowning down comments from critics, especially those here on IMDb, about the historical accuracy and relation to truth. With a certain amount of creative license required to be an effective film in itself anyway, and not having that much knowledge about the ins and outs of it all myself, I choose to simply judge The Imitation Game on its aesthetic merits as a film on which there is much to recommend.Gradually building his profile over the recent years, in time this will come to be regarded as Cumberbatch's signature role, the part that really gave him his kudos as a mainstream, A list actor and performer. It is a performance that requires complete transformation, and that couldn't be done with any half measures, and so he becomes the distinctive Turing, with the dress, mannerisms and posture to really believe this awkward, unassuming, introverted nerd is really in front of you, and you are party to his dogged, seemingly insane determination to win the war he knows it will be won. If you think of the world we live in today, and how computers now really are controlling everything (probably more than humans), then depending on whether you think that's more of a benefit or a curse, the character will stir your emotions more either way. But aside from this, it's an unsettling reminder of a comparatively recent period of our time when unspeakable bigotry was law and simply inhuman methods to enforce it so destroyed some of our greatest minds.An impressive supporting cast, most notably Keira Knightley as Turing's insincere love interest, but also including Charles Dance, Matthew Goode and Mark Strong in other key roles, undoubtedly add to the overall mix in a positive way. It retells a story everyone was probably already aware of, but from a different angle and shining uncomfortable new light on grubbier aspects of it. ****",9,1,3,9 August 2015
8 Mile," Perfectly watchable-but not brilliant
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs8 Mile is controversial Detroit rapper Eminem's eagerly anticipated acting debut.It was probably a good idea for his first time in front of the camera to stick to material relatively close to home and appear in a movie that is more-or-less semi-autobiographical.Does he pull it off?Yes,he more than passes muster.Being his first time,he hasn't quite mastered a naturalness that he would need to develop in order to be considered a truly amazing acting force,but he certainly tries very hard and carries himself very powerfully.The rest of the main cast,Kim Basinger,Mekki Phyiffer and Brittany Murphy,however,turn in merely adequate,passable performances which are less acceptable for more experienced actors.It doesn't help much that they are given such contrieved,unoriginal dialogue to work with,though.The film's other real fault is that the story has no real sense of structure or coherence.Although the central character and the situations and people he becomes involved with are very engaging,there's no real actual plot to follow and this ends up becoming quite a distracting hinderance.A good recommendation about the film however,is that it really comes alive towards the end,making you just able to care about the end outcome.The rapping sequences are great fun to watch too,watching the characters spurt out catchy,bouncing tunes that get lodged in your head,especially during the 'choking' scenes.Although this doesn't quite match up to director Curtis Hanson's original movie L.A. Confidential,it is easily on a par with his last film,Wonder Boys.***",Null,2,3,4 February 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," It's a Tarantino film alright (well,half of one)
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn a plot that pays homage to the Bruce Lee martial arts flicks Tarantino loved during his youth (even Thurman's suit towards the end of the film is an exact replica of the one worn by Lee in Game of Death),Uma Thurman stars as 'The Bride' (codename:Black Mamba) who is left for dead,heavily pregnant,by The Black Viper Assassination Squad,in the shape of O-Ren Ishii (codename:Cottonmouth)(Lucy Liu),Elle Driver (codename:California Mountain Snake),(Daryl Hannah),Vernita Green (codename:Copperhead) (Vivica A. Fox) and the as-yet undeveloped Budd (codename:Sidewinder) (Michael Madsen) and her boss,Bill (David Carradine) on her wedding day.Four years later,she awakens from a coma to exact revenge.The story is told,in true Tarantino style,with the use of flashbacks and back story.Tarantino has never been known as a film maker who skimps on the gory details or makes films for the faint hearted,and this film is so far from an exception it hurts.It is truly one of the most violent,blood thirsty films in recent memory.So many decapitations,in the shapes of arms,legs,hands,ankles,and even heads get slashed off,not to mention all the graphic blood spurting going on (not all of it really necessary and,in one case,even believable) that by the end of the film,you've run the risk of becoming almost totally desensitised to it.This,would,however match the nasty,mean spirited and often gratuitous tone that runs throughout much of the beginning.This actually ends up as being off putting and even a little upsetting to be honest,and it certainly makes it an arguous struggle to make it through to the middle and ending.It starts to get better and more mesmerising here,but there are other faults that start to creep in.While the visual style and soundtrack magnetize your attention,the actual story and script begin to waver.The story itself becomes almost none existent and the script has a few implausibilities (are we supposed to take the scene where Thurman wipes out so many members of the Yakuza with a sword single handedly seriously?Why do none of the gang members use any guns?).And,with Tarantino films admired so much for their witty dialogue and banter,this certainly is that (hopefully) rare exception.A lot of it feels too forced and overly sincere,while some ('You didn't think it was going to be that easy,did you?','You know for a second there?Yeah,I kinda did') is just plain clichéd.Perhaps Tarantino was trying to honour his kung fu film favourites with such bad dialogue,but,to me,it often seemed like the line between homage and parody started to blur uncomfortably together.I'm sure there's some witty social commentary that I'm not getting that some IMDb reviewer will end up pointing out to me,but I found it buried far too deep to be let out.As I said,the soundtrack and visual style were excellent and the fight scenes themselves were brilliant,extremely well chereographed and sadistically entertaining no end (though you may require a strong stomach).So,really a film of mixed halves,very good in certain areas with a lot to recommend it,leaving you dripping with anticipation for the follow up.****",Null,1,2,2 December 2003
Saw II," Inevitable and inevitably of poorer quality
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A crooked cop (Donnie Whalberg) becomes the latest target of the twisted Jigsaw (Tobin Bell.) A S.W.A.T. team has tracked the elusive killer down and has him stationed. But they've burst in at just the worst time- he has another group of victims trapped, including the cop's wayward son, in a room that's slowly filling with a deadly nerve gas. If he wants to see his son alive again, the cop had better just listen carefully...A sequel to a successful horror film is an inevitable but also inevitably worse thing. As, once again, is the case here with the follow-up to last year's box office Cube rip-off hit Saw.It has a few of the problems it's predecessor had. It's still very much a rip-off of Cube, a little known independent film that's developed a bit of a cult following, as well as elements of Phone Booth. Throw into the equation some stereo-typical characters (the heavy smoking, hard-edged bent cop, the wayward son, the pushy female character) and a lack of actual effective scares, as well as the obligatory rock song playing over the closing credits, and you don't have a searing film experience. The poor box office performance indicates Saw 3 might not be hitting us quite so quickly and when it does it may just be the start of a straight-to-DVD franchise. *",2,7,17,10 November 2005
Jurassic World," Satisfactory in what it aims to be, but still leaves you with the feeling of being a missed opportunity
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) are two siblings who have been sent away for a holiday to the Jurassic World theme park by their over-bearing mother, trying to divert their minds from the divorce that's brewing between her and their father. Meanwhile, on the island resort, Claire (Bruce Dallas Howard), the boy's aunt and senior management figure, has to present the new, genetically created super-monster to some potential investors. To oversee it's behaviour, she selects old flame Owen (Chris Pratt), whose rough, renegade style will have it's ups and downs. But the new super dinosaur has a mind of it's own, and has plans to break free from captivity and wreak havoc on the island.Anyone over the age of thirty is likely to have the original Jurassic Park moulded in to their minds in some way. Even if they never saw the film, the sheer amount of publicity and merchandise it attracted would keep it engraved in their minds. As such, Jurassic World, the spin off film of the series, is serving much the same function as The Phantom Menace did in 1999, for those for whom Star Wars was the film from their youth (and who are over the age of forty!) It's not a heartless, soulless spin off, like many that fall from the Hollywood cookie cutter machine these days, and there is spark and potential in the script, but sadly, while this is evident, it just doesn't manage to really be the sum of it's parts.The idea of Jurassic Park having become a theme park for tourists, with tacky souvenir shops and franchise establishments everywhere, and having the dinosaurs as modern day animals in a modern day zoo ('kids get bored just staring at a stegosaurus these days...' as the Claire character comments at the beginning) is an interesting one, and has the potential to serve as a really good set up. But for some reason, the story moves away from this, and has some disjointed narratives serving as the plot, flitting from Pratt and Howard trying to bring the escaped animals down, to the two boys trying to stay out of harm's way, through to Irrfan Khan and BD Wong fighting for control as the situation worsens. Pratt is the new go to man for this kind of thing, and he is strong and solid in his role here, although Simpkins and Robinson are a pretty cardboard copy of the kids from the first film.Visually, of course, the film is far from a disappointment. The dinosaur designs and effects are even more astonishing than they were twenty years ago, and are a breath-taking spectacle as we watch them battle on the island. Director Colin Trevorrow has managed to stick true to this aspect of what made the original so memorable, but has just failed to serve it with a stronger script or coherent narrative. It basically serves it's purpose, and can't really be called a let down in any way, just something that could have been a little more. ***",7,2,12,19 July 2015
Paranormal Activity," Pretty corny rubbish, really, but something keeps you hooked to the end
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning These types of 'shaky hand held camera' horror films have been very much in the fashion over the last few years, with notable films including The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield and Quarantine. And this offering that Steven Spielberg apparently called 'the scariest film he'd ever seen', which focuses on a couple who share a big house in the San Diego suburbs that seems to suffer from a demonic squatter. It's my fault for not checking it more closer, but being a motion sickness sufferer, these films just don't appeal to me. Why I didn't switch Paranormal Activity off about half an hour in to it is baffling to me, since the plot and the two main characters just weren't engaging me that much and yes, I was starting to feel slightly ill. But despite the corny story that you can take the michael out of till the cows come home and the irritating lead couple, I was compelled to watch it to the end. Somehow, this very average, flawed film does create a genuine air of mystery with regards the supernatural presence, weirdly more so when a specialist confirms it feels more like a 'demon' than a ghost. When the mystery ending does come by, it doesn't really come as a revelation or clear anything up, and in some ways is just as laughable as the film has been up to this point, but all the same, Paranormal Activity has a supernatural hold over you. **",4,0,1,8 April 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Does it's job well
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits To any child who ever grew up in Blighty, the tales of Roald Dhal should be as familiar as apple pie. So every child who ever was is likely to be familiar with the tale of Charlie (Freddie Highmore) a young kid with problems in life. His family don't have much and, without even realizing it (or at least not making that much of a fuss about it!) the building contractors have done a really sh!tty job on his house (it's slanting!) and every time a family member enters the house, they address the others by saying 'hello Buckets!) ??? Anyway, Charlie's luck's about to change when eccentric chocolate maker William Wonka (current wonder-kid Johnny Depp) places some shiny tickets in bars of his chocolate brands. Charlie picks the losing ticket at first and has to make do with his no-doubt scrumptuous choccy-bar. But his grand-father's a persistent old fruit and uses his money to buy him another one. This time luck lets him be a lady, and pleasant young Charlie gets sent off to Wonka's factory, with it's mountains of choccy and candy and Oompa Loompas (singing, dancing weirdos in costumes all played by one peculiar actor!) with a load of otherwise snotty brats who need a moral lesson in their lives. And Wonka's just the person to give it.Through-out the last year or so, I've been trying to get more into children's films. From the age of 16 or so, I'd sort of accepted that I'd grown out of them and focused all my attention on more high-brow, adult orientated stuff. But I started to notice a lot of critics giving rave reviews to a lot of these kiddie flicks, so I gave Finding Nemo a try, no great shakes (in my opinion!) but I followed it up with The Incredibles (which was ace!) earlier in the year. And I remembered a little film called Toy Story, released nearly ten years ago, which I could still appreciate today. So I took it on that giving my time to kids films again wasn't such a bad thing. So I'll try and seek out the Harry Potter films sometime soon (can't believe they're making a fourth film!) And I was glad to have let down my reservations and seen this adaptation by Tim Burton.Those already familiar with Burton's unique style of filming will find CATCF terra ferma, and so will those coming to experience his unique approach to family films. But despite all the rave reviews, it's undeniable that this is a film with some serious flaws. And these mainly revolve around the lead star. Highmore as Charlie, as the lead star, gets hardly any screen-time but ironically in the scenes he's in, he kind of annoyingly wholesome, brattishly so, even. And as Wonka, you could say Depp is kind of mis-cast, but he is sort of hammy for some parts of the film (although you get the impression he did the best he could with the part!) The supporting cast are quite good, in the shape of Helena Bonham Carter, Christopher Lee and Noah Taylor, through to the more unknown stars. The Oompa-Loompa singing/dancing sequences are also quite well done and have a genuine sort of charm to them.Overall, I can say this mostly succeeds as a good representation of what fans of Burton's usual work will be expecting, but no matter what everyone else is saying, there are some serious flaws present and it serves as no great notch on Depp's present career high. ***",7,1,3,2 September 2005
Mission: Impossible II," A bit better than the original....but not much
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsHaving eagerly anticipated viewing the original in the summer of 1996,and then to view what was hailed by all the critics as the best blockbuster of the summer left me totally baffled at how jaw droppingly incoherent and poor it was.So,naturally,the moment a sequel was suggested,I did'nt show much interest,until I learned that John Woo was at the directorial helm.And this pretty much shows throughout the movie.Because if the man is utterly hopeless at piecing together an intricate,twisty turny plot,then boy does he know how to direct an action sequence,as is shown at the end.The explosions/fighting interlude ,involving motorbikes,vans,and ,as usual,many,many guns,was very well handled,and pretty much filled a very huge gap in a sagging movie.On the performances front,Tom Cruise acts like he's desperately trying to get off to sleep in the role,occasionally getting agitated if someone nudges him,whilst it's shocking to think how much they must have payed Anthony Hopkins just for two scenes,one more involving only his voice,and Thandie Newton is incredably overrated,not just as an actress,but she's nowhere near as attractive as everyone makes her out to be either.The worst aspect of the film is that it all just feels like a huge marketing gimmick,which,when you think about it,is always a hinderance in being entertained.Nevertheless,if action ,twisty turny plot revalations,and stunts (the hanging cliff-top thing at the beginning is truly breathtaking)and you either did'nt mind or quite enjoyed the original,this is another film that's much better catching at the cinema,than on video where it will probably lose all it's spectacle.***",Null,1,2,23 August 2000
World Trade Center," Veers off course sometimes, but generally hits all the right notes and is great for it
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning September 11, 2001 (a day that was always going to get made into a feature film and what better time to do it than on the fifth anniversary.) A day that started as ordinarily as any other. People woke up in the morning, kissed their families goodbye and headed out to earn another honest day's crust and to go about their business as ordinarily as they ever would. None of them had any idea about the unthinkable events that would unfold as the day went on. When the first planes hit the building, a rescue mission was launched headed up by firemen and some brave members of the NYPD. They go in to rescue those trapped in the rubble, only for the building to come crashing down around them, trapping them underneath. This story focuses on two of those trapped, Captain John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Seargent Will Jemeno (Michael Pena) and their never-ending hope and determination to survive as those on the outside struggle desperately to bring them out alive.As I said, it was only a matter of time before a film depicting the events on that fateful day in September of 2001 was made. And what better time to make it than on the fifth anniversary? Notorious Hollywood hack Oliver Stone, a man who's made his fare share of greats in his time, from JFK to Platoon, but who has also made some quite rotten stinkers including Natural Born Killers and Any Given Sunday, to his credit pulls off the job at hand very well here. The films falters sometimes, but generally it avoids verging into sappy sentimentality and flag waving and instead just concentrates on crafting a poignant, realistic, engrossing, believable and effecting portrayal of events as they likely panned out on that day. It's not quite United 93 we're talking here and it's not quite as good as that film but, thankfully, it's not far off.He gives the film a dash of gloss and reverence but I don't think Nicolas Cage was the right man for the job in the lead role here. Portraying a real life character in a real life event, he can't relate his snazzy, eccentric edge he gives his characters to the role, and comes off as a bit forced and restrained as a result. Thankfully, the supporting cast manage to keep things alive and kicking in the background, providing a raw edge to how the characters they are playing must have felt on that awful day.The film pulls no punches and goes all out to provide a true and accurate account of what happened on that day and how those involved reacted to it. Sometimes it falters and becomes a little sentimental and mushy, especially towards the end as the script starts to run out of steam a little, but generally it keeps things going very well and has given Stone a more appreciative place in my conscious when he could very well have made a big and offensive mess of it as he has in the past. ****",9,1,5,23 October 2006

The Hangover Part II," It was never going to be up to the standard of the original, but it was hard to think it would fall this short of the mark
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 'The Wolfpack' return, this time with Doug (Justin Bartha) engaged to a beautiful Thai girl and descending on the city for a weekend of the wild partying they'll always be remembered for from the first film. But when one of their group goes missing again, they're thrown into another series of wild escapades, involving their old friend Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) a ruthless gangster (Paul Giamatti) and Mike Tyson! For the wonderful gems it sometimes churns out, it's easy to forget that Hollywood is fundamentally a business in the area of making money. So while an occasional film like The Hangover may come alike that was a far bigger hit than anyone could have imagined and developed it's own cult following, it's almost a forgone conclusion that they will want to cash in on this and make a sequel that will be commercially quite successful and likely to have a big box office opening weekend, but artistically will be quite a failure in light of it's inspiration. And no doubt director Todd Phillips's ego was spurred on with what a runaway success his first film was and was happy to go along with it and thought he could manage the same success twice. And so we have The Hangover Part II which is basically everything The Hangover was...but isn't.The formula from the first film is repeated almost exactly, as it often is, with the location simply switched from Las Vegas to Thailand, but this in itself feels like enough to feel down on it, with the bright lights and dazzling spectacle of the world's gambling capital replaced with the more diluted, down played back drop of the far east. But most crucially the laugh quotient is significantly down, with the set ups and delivery simply failing to work the way they did the first time round. The characters are basically the same, Bradley Cooper's Phil the smooth, charming one, Zach Galifianakis's boorish buffoon getting up to his usual antics and, of course, Bartha's Doug the mild mannered, unwitting one who ends up going mad, as well as a few of the novelty characters from the first film re-introduced, but none to the effect of the first film. To try and liven things up a bit, at the end we have the baffling spectacle of Mike Tyson performing his own little live music stint.The Hangover Part II is simply a sequel that is unsurprisingly not as good as the original. Sadly, it's not by a mile and then some. *",2,0,3,17 January 2012
A Bug's Life," A movie with a lot to stick up to.....and a lot to it's credit!
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsI'm going to have to add a hint of laziness to my review here.This is the starting point of another review when I have to say that before you even begin to watch A Bug's Life,you know it has a lot of competition to stand up to.Firstly,there's Antz,the other insect related feature that was released nationwide at cinemas not 2 months before it.Secondly,there's Disney/Pixar's other 'same-style-of-animation'movie Toy Story ,which drew in hefty review's about a couple of years back.Somehow,the Disney bug movie manages to fall short on both these other animation features.Maybe my frame of mind would be different if I was a 2 year old movie critic,but you don't get many of them.However,I do think A Bug's Life could have made it easier on itself:what's the one key thing that both Antz and Toy Story,both intended as children's films in the first place,have in common?:kid's under the above age,according to the standards set by Hollywood movie clerks,don't like a movie of their's to run much over 80 minutes,or so.With Antz running in at 79 minutes,and Toy Story coming in at 77,ABL has to run on for an astounding 93 minutes!And,yes,the story get's very,very ponderous.About 30 minutes into the movie,I gave up thinking there might be an intelligent,intricate plot line to follow ,because I'm sure this was intended as a simple,undemanding kid's film (I borrowed it off my 3 year old cousin!),until I came to the obvious realisation that people of about that age are'nt going to notice lazy plot gaps,and are most likely just going to be entertained by all the dazzling lights,and characters.This is one of the movie's good points:the characters,and,of course,their appearance on screen.The swarthy stick insect,the German slug,and the meditating green horn are fun character's.I think it's highly unlikely the producer's ripped off the Antz idea of observational ,social humour ,since both the films were produced at pretty much the same time,unless ,of course,they had an insider working for them in the conference room of the other film.But,it would'nt have worked anyway,because,frankly,a large chunk of it simply dos'nt work here.The 2 main character's,Flick and Hopper,emerge as one-dimensional,stereotype ideas from other films before it,and the only redeeming feature in this area of the film is,as ever,the hilarious outtakes.A Bug's Life holds the attention,but it could probably do so much more if you were'nt so old.****",Null,1,3,29 April 2000
Prisoners," Deep, absorbing thriller digging further than you might have expected it to
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningKeller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are plunged in to every parent's worst nightmare when their daughter goes missing, along with the daughter of their close friends Franklin (Terence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis.) The finger of suspicion ends up pointing at Alex (Paul Dano), a local impaired boy, but due to a lack of evidence, Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the detective in charge of the investigation, is forced to let him go, much to Keller's chagrin. He takes the law in to his own hands in a desperate bid to find out where his daughter is, but nothing is quite as it seems and the real reason behind the girl's disappearance may be deeper buried than they thought.Sometimes, a simple, straight-forward story can work on far more levels and have a lot more to it if there are some strong human dynamics behind the scenes of it, i.e. in this case the ultimate nightmare of any parent, the loss of a child. Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners sets itself on a much grander scale than your average staple thriller, driven as it is by a strong sense of dark, forbidding atmosphere and stark exploration of human emotions and dynamics. In short, it has a lot more going for it than your typical thriller of it's ilk, filling every second of it's two and a half hour running time with hidden depths that just keep on coming, even if at times it all just does feel a little over whelming.While it's cascading down this emotional roller coaster ride, it's careful never to forget or unduly expose the mystery element to the story, keeping up the suspense over the missing girls and who or even what could be behind their disappearance. For material of this length, strong performances are a no brainer, and indeed we have revelatory turns from lead stars Gyllenhaal, turning in maybe his most intense, driven performance yet as the detective under pressure from others that never lets up, driven mad by constant potential break-throughs that lead nowhere, but it's Jackman as the tormented parent who possibly makes the biggest impression, channeling his Wolverine anger into something that will gain him more appreciation with a different audience.In aiming that bit higher than your typical thriller fare, Prisoners may be a bit too much for some to take in, and occasionally it is a little pretentious and see-through in trying to be deep, but it is no less of an accomplished effort that succeeds in what it sets out to do. ****",9,2,3,12 May 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Somewhat over-whelming, but still a pretty spectacular ride
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Opening in the action, the Avengers have been sent to rescue some people from a mad doctor in the Alps, who wants to experiment on them. Among them are a brother and sister pair, who possess special powers of their own, but who hold a grudge against Tony Stark, as they remember seeing a weapon made by his company lying in the rubble, after their parents were killed in the war torn country they are from. But after the mission's success, Stark becomes the spanner in the works again, when he talks fellow scientist Bruce Banner in to meddling with nature and opening the peacekeeping program Ultron to secure harmony in the world. Big mistake, as Ultron forms a life of it's own, and decides to try and wipe out the human race and replace it with his own kind.Having unthinkably missed the original Avengers spectacle on the big screen three years ago, no way was I going to miss Joss Whedon's inevitable sequel, which promised to be bigger, badder and balsier than the last one, as they always do. This may be the case, but it hardly makes it better, as such. And, as grand and outside the box as it may be, that is the case. The follow up, like it's main antagonist Stark, is a victim of it's own blind ambition, a relentless, none stop roller coaster ride that bombards you with flash all the way to the end, and just leaves you over-whelmed. With Stark being the main character, and Robert Downey Jr. being the biggest star, it falls to reason that most of the attention falls on them, with even the publicity before the film's release (notably Jr's unfortunate walk-out interview with Tristram Guru Murphy or whatever his name is) maybe tying in with the hype.At nearly three hours, the film is just too over-loaded and over ambitious, getting carried away with itself and just leaving the viewer feeling deflated by the end as a result. It would be one thing if there were some exciting bits throughout, but there's too many long stretches where nothing exciting happens that make it even more too much. Going on this long, it stands to reason that too much must be going on with the plot, which just gets a little over-complicated and at times none coherent.Like the predecessor, however, it wisely keeps it's tongue in it's cheek, and the gang (especially, as ever, Stark) are always at their wise cracking best, it's still a dazzlingly colourful spectacle with, at times, jaw dropping action and visual effects and, again, it works better with them all as one than as separate entities on their own. The original, however, wisely kept it all at an endurable running time, so you could appreciate these qualities more, while this follow up goes overboard and, for all it's strengths, is just a little too much as a result. ***",7,5,12,12 May 2015
The Insider," Thoroughly engrossing account that works on all levels

The Dark Knight," Maybe a bit better than the last film, but pretty much a lot of the same thing, to be honest
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After cleaning up Gotham at the end of the last film, Batman's legacy is now being followed up by the police department of the city, who are tracing the funds of all known criminals so they can freeze their assets and stop them profiteering off their crimes. The only trouble is, the Chinese banker they all use has flown off to Hong Kong and now doesn't have to answer to American law. Batman soon changes this, but he has new problems to face in the shape of The Joker (Heath Ledger) a psychopathic criminal in clown make up who's hoping to wipe all the competition out and take down the police force while he's at it. Meanwhile, in the personal life of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) new problems are faced in the shape of his ex Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) taking up with hot shot DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) who's on his own crusade to wipe out crime in the city. But a devastating chain of events is about to make him come to question his side of morality.With the greatest respect, it often seems the case that when a famous person dies, the shock, grief, respect or whatever that people want to show can cause them to overlook their work or over praise them, as if greatness can be determined by death. I often wonder if Bruce Lee hadn't died, whether Enter the Dragon would enjoy half the cult status it does over thirty years on or if Princess Diana would be hailed as half the saint she was. In case you've been living on Planet Mars since January, you will know I am of course referring to Heath Ledger. He's certainly been the talk of the film, and it's gained some criticism for using a dead man to gain publicity. I loved Jack Nicholson as The Joker in the 1989 film, and was a little swayed against anyone being as good as he was. But the truth is simply what everyone has been saying, Ledger is just a different Joker, darker and nowhere near as camp. He's not better and not worse than Nicholson, just playing him under a different method.As for the rest of the cast, Bale maintains his suave, dark, deep Wayne act from the last film and has undeniable presence in the most important role. As Dent, Eckhart is dynamic but over-emphatic and over-bearing. At times this makes his performance quite good, at others a little campy. Veteran actors Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine provide amiable support in side roles.In the UK, there's been a bit of a furore over the apparent amount of violence in the film for a 12A. I would say ignore this, as I didn't see anything that was worse than the last film and this just seems to be The Daily Mail having something to stir up sh!t about.Batman has certainly never been darker than under Christopher Nolan, and he continues his blurry, grey vision of the character here. He's not simply trying to tell a story, but also all the back story and tribulations Batman brings with him. This gives the film depth, but maybe it's a bit too much for someone who wants a simple action film. I liked it maybe slightly more than the last film, some good action and impressive performances, but this version of Batman feels a little too over ambitious and overblown for my liking. ****",9,2,11,16 August 2008
Green Street Hooligans," Another of a recent crop of British films with a worryingly similar mind-set
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Unjustly expelled from Harvard for having a stash of cocaine in his possession, Matt (Elijah Wood) moves up to London to live with his sister and her husband Steve (Marc Warren), whose chirpy, cock-sure younger brother Pete (Charlie Hunnam) he is quickly introduced to. Pete is at first reluctant to become friendly with Matt and allow him to tread around the capital city with him, because he may be viewed as an 'outsider', but after a heavy drinking session with his mates, he soon starts to change his opinion of him. On his way back from a football match, Matt is viciously accosted by a gang of Birmingham City thugs, until Pete and his friends come along and help him out. From here, Matt learns their true identity- they are football hooligans, operating the GSE (Green Street Elite) 'firm.' Initially fearful of the violence, Matt soon finds himself becoming as desensitized to it as his new found friends- but suspicion, shocking revelations and unsettled scores combine to devastating effect when it all climaxes in a free-for-all brawl between London's most heated football rivals-Millwall and Chelsea.Exceedingly similar ground has been tread already, very recently too, with last year's The Football Factory. So that's two films in very quick succession of each other about football violence. And there's also been a fair few of what the British make best-gangster movies, with The Business and the recently released Revolver. All films aimed at the more criminal way of existence. And all British. It's not the actual films themselves, it's just the amount and consistency of them that I feel may be playing a part in glamorizing all the lawlessness that is present in modern day Britain.As for the actual film itself, Green Street is, well, very similar to The Football Factory. It brings the world of the football hooligan to life, exploring the motivation behind it and the kinship that develops between those involved. Only it provides characters with more intelligence and humanity, and it could be said that ultimately there's just more depth there. But this, for me at least, was sort of a blessing and a curse. While I was watching it, I just couldn't help thinking of TFF and the more easier flowing, less thickly spread feel to it and just ending up finding this a bit over-whelming and force-fed. The most worrying thing about both these films is just how successfully they succeed in glamorizing the football violence culture and making an aggression in the viewer pop up that may not have been there before. I'm a very gentle person, but I'll admit that both of these films managed to pep me up and make me see an attraction to the idea of soccer violence.On the performances front, as an American in the lead role, Wood continues to craft a notable career for himself and through-out you're never able not to notice his sweet, innocent, pretty-boy complexion and genuinely feel how out of place he looks amongst all these hooligans. In the main supporting role, Hunnam is certainly very compelling. His character is very well-written, high-lighting how some of the most prolific firm members can actually be rather articulate and hold down very respectable professions outside the firm (he is revealed through-out the film as a PE and History teacher at a primary school!) but his accent is a bit dodgy. His cockney geezer dialect is very shaky through-out. I've just learned he actually comes from Newcastle. There's no way he was really from London, but when his accent fails in bits of the film I thought he actually sounded vaguely American, like his co-star. Warren and the rest of the supporting cast are solid and are an essential driving force to the rest of the film.Overall, this is certainly a very enjoyable, impressive film that is well worth seeing and, who knows, maybe if I'd seen it before TFF I'd have enjoyed it even more. I know that I should just stop trying to compare it to that film so much, but in light of that film, good though this is, I couldn't help but find it a bit harder to digest and get into the swing of as much. ***",7,0,0,26 September 2005
Blood Diamond," Lengthy but well worth seeing and an understandable Oscar contender
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Danny Archer (Leo Di Caprio) is a South African born diamond smuggler who transports diamonds illegally for a London based firm. Meanwhile Solomon (Djimon Hounsou) is a typical African villager who dreams that his son will grow up to be a doctor, only for a militant band of rebels called the KUF to invade his village, take his son hostage and force him to work fishing diamonds out the rivers. Their paths are about to cross in an explosive way when Solomon is caught by a KUF commander trying to conceal a precious diamond for himself and is thrown into a prison camp. Danny gets him out to work for him but Solomon won't do anything until he's found his son and so begins a desperate and deadly race across Africa for the two men, along with idealistic reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connolly) who wants to expose the corruption going on.In the leading role, Di Caprio's never been an actor I've really warmed to, as I've always seen him as more of a teen heart-throb rather than a serious actor, but he's making that transition now and roles like this will raise his profile to where he wants to be. His accent was a bit shaky, to be honest, meant to be South African but at times it sounded vaguely cockney and then even Austrailian. Nevertheless, he delivered a fairly commanding performance in the lead role. In the main supporting roles, Hounsou and Connolly are also commendable, if not anything really special.Performances don't drive the film, the story does, a sprawling, sweeping tale that brings the decadence and evil of the African situation to life, as we see the same problems faced there as they are for black people all over the world, with child soldiers being recruited to serve for militant soldiers, in much the same way as any gang member would do to a kid living in Rio or SC Los Angeles, their young, naive minds being corrupted into thinking they are doing the right thing, made to feel big with a gun and an attitude, and with the same horrid, hollering gangsta rap music blaring all around them. That said, the film also manages some nicer moments, with some great cinematography of wide, luscious African hills, forests and rivers and a genuinely engaging central story of hope and survival. Edward Zwick, whose Legends of the Fall is the main film of his that springs to mind, guides the whole thing along in a manner that's sometimes a bit wavey but nevertheless engaging.Your attention might wonder a bit sometimes, but overall this is a very rewarding and well made film that was pretty much made for Oscar night. ****",9,1,3,28 August 2007
Elysium," Visually striking, if nothing else, a movie made for cinema
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the year 2054, massive over population and massive poverty have left earth a baron, desolate wasteland. The rich and powerful have hop footed it up to a magical new place called Elysium, a paradise where people can live in peace and luxury, at the expense of the hard labour of those down below, such as Max (Matt Damon), a bulky manual worker who gets infected with something nasty after an accident at work. To get the cure he needs, he has no choice but to take on an assignment for renegade Julio (Deigo Luna), in the shape of apprehending smarmy Elysium corporate manager John Carlyle (William Fichtner) and stealing some information from his brain. Delacourt (Jodie Foster), the ice queen ruler of Elysium, can't have this and sends the ruthless Kruger (Sharlito Copley) to deal with him.Very few directors start off as big names. It's unlikely a major studio, with no track record of their previous box office magic, will grant them a huge budget to start off with, however visionary their ideas may be or however driven they appear to attain perfection. So it's more likely, if they're going to end up making a big name for themselves, that they'll need to get a cult hit on their hands first, a small budget offering that maybe becomes something of a sleeper hit and develops a loyal fan base, even if it's only a small one. And so Neill Blomkamp a few years back, gave us his still memorable District 9, that had the distinction of having impressed none other than Peter Jackson. And if the Lord of the Rings guy loves it, who is anyone else to complain?Despite having a much bigger budget and consequentially far more publicity, Elysium still hasn't lost the touch Blomkamp gave D9, this time with visually awesome, magnificent special effects that retain the dark, dystopian feel he managed with a much smaller budget. It's a film you need to catch at the cinema, preferably an IMAX, I guess, where you can get the full effect of the stunning spectacles on offer. Of course, aside from these, Elysium suffers in other ways. Naturally, as a post apocalyptic science fiction film, there's the opportunity for some social commentary on how things could turn out and the pros and cons of living in such a world, but the screenplay seems far less concerned with what over population could drive the world to, and instead just getting on with a fairly generic, predictable story that just serves as a catalyst for all the destruction and mayhem that ensues.The film aims to blow you away with it's scope and vision, and you have a right to expect great things in that department. You can even expect a decent piece of trashy fun to munch some popcorn to. But you'll have to be in a far less demanding mood in terms of the writing, dialogue and anything else that would have given it more substance. ***",7,0,1,3 September 2013
Taken," Satisfactory enough old fashioned action thriller
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is a former Special Forces operative who now ekes out an existence providing private security to special events and people. His estranged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) wants to take an around the world trip with her best friend, but Bryan has reservations. These prove to be valid when Kim is kidnapped by an unidentified gang, and he hears it happen over the phone. He then begins a desperate trek around Paris trying to find out who the gang are, what they want and where his daughter is before it's too late.This short and sweet little action film seems to be trying to re-write the conventions for the genre. To wit Neeson's father figure, remaining impeccably calm as he hears his daughter being kidnapped over the phone, telling her to hide (even though she gets taken anyway!) and then telling the kidnappers even more calmly '...if it's money you want, I don't have it. What I do have is a set of skills I have acquired over many years, skills which make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let her go now, this'll be the end of it. I will not hunt you. But if you don't, I will hunt you, I will find you and I will kill you', as you do. With 'good luck' as his reply, he has all the ammunition he needs to set off on his quest to find his off spring and punish her assailants. Neeson suits the action hero role perfectly, and brings that slight bit more gusto and dynamism to what is essentially a straight to DVD action film on the big screen, while director Pierre Morrel uses his home city effectively as the backdrop for the agoraphobic angst the desperate but clear headed father must be feeling as he prowls through such a big place for his most loved one.It's generic, it's predictable, it's ridiculous, but it's just enough fun to make it an above average action film. ***",7,0,0,15 May 2011
Avatar," The weaknesses as a film are there, but yes, it is still an experience like no other
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning When his scientist brother dies, crippled marine Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) becomes his stand in for his extensive knowledge of his brother's plans. This puts him in the firing line of Dr.Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and her team, for his lack of scientific knowledge, as they try and mould a way for humans to enter the world of the Na'vi, the indigenous people of a planet that Col. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and businessman Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) want to conquer for personal gain. As Sully forms a close alliance with Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) a female na'vi warrior and begins to be accepted by the rest of the clan, it becomes a battle between ethics and power, humanity and evil and a climactic battle to end it all.James Cameron has to keep going and making the most expensive film ever made, what with Terminator 2, True Lies and, most recently (like, 1997 recently) Titanic...and now his latest, Avatar, stretching at just under three hours again, has gone and gained the accolade again as well as becoming the fastest grossing film of all time. Some people always have to do bigger and better, but the two don't go hand in hand that often. Luckily, as a filmic experience in itself, Avatar will stay memorable for a while.Since the effects are the main thing that's making it, it has to be seen in 3D, which you will note has improved greatly over the years, to where it can still be seen perfectly without the 'special glasses.' But wearing them really does improve the experience, to where you really do feel yourself being sucked from your seat into the world of the film itself. But note, the effects are what make the film such an amazing, unforgettable experience. Surely enough, the massive hype has seen the film sprung up to number 46 on the IMDb top 250, which is low if you remember where The Dark Knight went, but I think people need to step back and see things more clearly. All I noticed aside from the effects were a lot of trite dialogue, thin characterization and long, meaningless stretches. Some have tried to make the film out to be some sort of study of the cruel, destructive nature of humans but I noticed nothing so dramatic driving the film. The performances hardly make things any better, Worthington interchangeable from his role in Terminator: Salvation and Lang and Ribisi rather cardboard villains. The female cast actually make it better, Saldana highly emotive as the na'vi warrior and Weaver impassioned as the scientist with a heart.Yes, if you look beneath the surface there are a lot of weaknesses in the fundamentals of the film. But as a breath taking, special effects spectacle, Cameron has gone and done it again, giving us a blast of million dollar magic that are part of making a film such a wonderous experience. For this reason alone, it really cannot be missed on the big screen, in the best 3D screen you can find. ****",9,0,4,6 February 2010
Drag Me to Hell," Ridiculous but decent Raimi horror effort

She decides to prove herself by refusing a loan extension to a desperate gypsy woman- a move that has devastating consequences when a curse is placed on her.Drag Me to Hell is silly, far fetched and overblown, but there's no denying the impressive competence director Sam Raimi has displayed with this effects filled horror effort. Fans and aficionados of the genre can expect some effective jump scenes as well as some really decent monster make up/prosphetics, and I suppose what could be described as a few genuinely shocking scenes (of the cat sacrificing variety.) What we have been lumbered with here is basically a forgettable but more than distracting piece that proves genuine, raw horror still has a notable audience. ***",7,1,2,27 January 2010
Selma," Probably not the epic it would have been twenty years ago, but still a lot to admire
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the 1960s, Professor Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) is in the thrust of his epic civil rights battle, which has come to the attention of President Johnson (Tom Wilkinson.) Johnson tries to assist King with some platitudes and assistance, but King believes the next major step forward is securing equal voting rights for him and his people. In the face of relentless violence and intimidation, from both sides of the law, King presses on regardless, with an epic march from Selma to Alabama.It seems to be the in thing these days, when making a film about an important historical figure, to focus on one particular event in their lives, rather than to make an all out epic dramatisation of their life story, like they would have twenty years ago, when the likes of Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard would have turned it into a three hour yarn of the sort I remember from my youth. For someone who remembers these types of films so vividly, this more condensed approach is a little hard to adjust to, but by zooming in on one important event in Kings life, Ava DuVarney has made a piece of art all the same.I always imagined who would portray King if ever a film was made about him, and it seems the honours have fallen to British actor David Oyelowo. Given the endless list of Hollywood candidates available, this is an achievement in and of itself, but that he nails it on the head so perfectly is something even better. Oyelowo captures King's speech, delivery, fluidity, mannerisms and general presence perfectly, and fits the role physically too. Given he's carrying the film, and his is the role it all centres on, this is a great thing, but it's not as if fine support from the likes of Wilkinson and Tim Roth don't help.It seems the honours have fallen on me to do the 200th review of this film, and given how well everything was pulled off, this is no poor honour. ****",9,1,2,28 October 2015
Invictus," Another competent, polished Eastwood effort
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1990, after nearly thirty years incarceration, Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) is released and becomes ruler of South Africa, signalling an end of the apartheid era and a new, more democratic nation setting in. However, there is social unease, as the national sport, rugby, is still under the moniker of the Springboks, a symbol of the pro apartheid era. However, Mandela hopes his nation to embrace a new notion of forgiveness, hopefully learning from his example towards his captors. After a series of meetings with celebrated Springboks captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) he sets a chain of events in motion that sees the team on course to victory at the 1995 Rugby Championships.At a time in his life and career where he prefers to be behind the camera rather than in front of it, Clint Eastwood is always very surprising in the choice of tale he brings to the big screen. Here is yet another surprising but effective story, brought to life with the professional standards you can always expect from Eastwood.In the lead role, Freeman, always an actor Eastwood gets the best from, plays Mandela in his sleep, but is blessed to capture his accent and mannerisms just fine, too. Likewise, Damon is well suited to the role of Springboks captain Pienaar, with the physical presence and stature to convince, but also evokes emotion by delivering a moving portrait of a man startled by another's ability to forgive and overcome. As the two lead stars of the film, they have even better chemistry than you might originally have thought.Director, stars and pretty much everyone involved have come together and delivered something fine. ****",9,0,0,6 September 2010
La La Land," Uplifting, sweet centred detour from the norm
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Mia (Emma Stone) is a barista on a Hollywood film set, who dreams of becoming a famous actress, but keeps having bad luck on auditions. She crosses paths with Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a brash, abrasive musician, who also wants to make it big, and is frustrated at anyone's inability to appreciate jazz. Although irritated by Sebastian's manner, Mia does admire his musical ability, and on this tender footnote they develop a friendship that blossoms into romance, and the ups and downs their paths take from this point.Damian Chazelle's glossy celebration of Hollywood from a time gone by suffered at the cruel, mocking hands of fate in the most humiliating of ways over the last fortnight, when the unbelievable drama of Oscars night unfolded across the mainstream media and, after being announced as the winner of Best Picture, it turned out this was a mistake, and the award actually went to the urban drama Moonlight. While drawing more attention to this catastrophic farrago seems tactless, I had been planning to see it even if this hadn't happened, and Oscar embarrassment aside, it's still a swirling, magical re-ignition of a genre that was popular in the golden age of Hollywood.While it's a celebration of something from a by-gone age, it's very much updated to modern times, capturing all the funk, style and spirit of the modern music and fashion scene, and so enthralling to those who are fans of musicals from the olden days, and appealing to those who are up on current trends. Considering the nature of both the main characters, lead stars Gosling and Stone are inspired choices, since their personalities match their demeaneurs so well, Gosling's moody, withdrawn but appealing character perfectly complimenting Stone's sturdy, downtrodden but hopeful and resilient heroine.And, just so it doesn't forget what it is that makes it so appealing to modern audiences, the song and dance numbers are perfectly magical too, really springing to life at the right moments and lighting up an already beautiful homage to the bygone musical. ****",9,3,9,6 March 2017
Saw," Fairly effective, but more a collection of original ideas than an original movie as a whole...
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Two complete strangers, a doctor (Cary Elwes) and an apparent waster (Leigh Wannell) awaken to find themselves in a brightly lit room chained by the foot in close proximity to each other. They soon find they have been placed there by a sadistic psychopath who wants one to kill the other in a battle to come out alive. As they sit around waiting for their time to run out, the doctor starts recalling in flashback events that may have possibly led up to their present predicament, the waster does the same and before long they are piecing things together as their sanity gradually deteriorates that lead up to a shattering final revelation. Whilst recounting events, the doctor also leads onto a story of a detective (Danny Glover) who became obsessed with hunting the killer down and may still be playing a part in events as they speak...There is one original angle of how the killer isn't technically really a killer after all and there are some interesting slants on how he selects his victims, but the movie as a whole actually borrows ideas from other, superior movies. Many have compared it to Se7en, but I actually think it has more in common with movies such as Cube (the concept of them waking up in an unfamiliar place with no idea how they got there!) and Phone Booth with the killers reasons for selecting those particular people.It's a fairly slick effort, genuinely suspenseful and with a great central performance from Elwes, not to mention having a well developed plot. But it's downfall is that it has aspirations of being a really high concept film when really for the most part, it's ironic that the killers name is 'Jigsaw' since that's what it's really like in terms of piecing all the bits it's stole from better movies together. ***",7,0,1,3 July 2005
The Last Samurai," Generally enjoyable Hollywood action period piece
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThe year is 1876.Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a disillusioned confederate soldier who's taken to the bottle and is haunted by nightmarish flashbacks of the atrocities he was forced to commit under the command of the ruthless Colnell Bagley (Tony Goldwyn).However,Bagley has a new proposition.Unscrupulous Japanese railroad contractor Omura (Masato Harada) wants him to train the army of Emporor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) to lead a rebellion against the army of the samurai who are opposing the development of his latest contract.However,time is money and,with the army unproperly trained,Omura orders them in to battle where they unsurprisingly lose their confidence and are effortlessly defeated by the well-trained,hardened samurai warriors.Nathan,however,is spared,the commanding samurai officer obviously impressed with his fighting ability,and taken to the land of the samurai,under the command of Emporor Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).Over the course of the next year,he discovers them to be the more fair-practicing group of people and,after becoming accustomed to their mannerisms and practices,the westerner gradually blends in with them and leads them to victory against the real oppressors.I had the same reservations with The Last Samurai that I seem to have with any film headbilling Tom Cruise.My cousin's rather fond of him,but I always seemed to regard him as more of a 'movie star' as opposed to a totally convincing 'actor.'In this instance,however,my reservations proved to be rather unfounded,as he carries the film fairly well.True,he gets a little carried away with himself here and there,but generally speaking,he does the business and does it well.Of the supporting cast,it's as encouraging as ever to see two British players in a major Hollywood production,in the shape of Billy Connolly as Zebulon Gant,a former comrade of Nathan's who encourages him to take up on Omura's offer and Timothy Spall,as his eccentric contact in Japan,my namesake,Mr Graham.All the Japanese actors,Watanabe,Harada,Nakamura,are perfectly fine too.I noticed that the first half of the film seemed to take itself rather too seriously,however,it seemed to telepathically sense this and threw in plenty of humour and light relief in the middle and the second part.The story is well developed and covers all the aspects it is attempting to explore,however,it was billed as an action movie,and spends considerably more time delving around in sappy melo-drama as opposed to satisfying the expectations of what the vast majority of the audience payed for.The action/battle scenes,spectacular though they are,are rather few and far between.Perhaps the movie was about quarter-of-an-hour too long,but all the same...Speaking of the battle scenes,this is where the movie really comes alive,in every sense of the word.It's not just how epic and exciting they themselves are,it's all the scenes associated with them as well,adding untold depth to men we only expected to see being trained and fighting in the fields.To wit,a scene where Nathan orders a young Japanese soldier to shoot him before he shoots him,in order to give him an impression of what a merciless killer he will need to be in order to survive the battlefield.Or how the soldiers,former peasants who've never fought in a battle before in their lives,lose their nerve as the samurai army emerge in to battle.There's some fine dialogue on offer too,evenly distributed throughout the film from beginning to end,and carrying the script wonderfully,only to wind up with a sappy,Hollywood-ised ending that will have you doing a little bit of laughing and a little bit of chringing with it's underlying corniness.Still,if you're looking for a fun night out,it's great fun and a film you can only truly appreciate at the cinema anyway.***",Null,1,2,8 February 2004

But as he digs deeper in to the case, he uncovers things even he couldn't imagine.Relative newcomer Scott Derrickson seems to have received quite a critical acclaim for his latest addition to the horror staple, and it's ravers do paint quite a convincing case for it. While it's far from the worst the genre has ever seen, I didn't find it quite a masterpiece.As the story opens, it is genuinely intriguing, and has the potential to keep you on edge, but then it sort of goes on, and just descends in to your typical jump scare horror film, and has a monster called 'Mr. Boogie' you're expected to be scared of. **",4,4,7,16 May 2013
A Clockwork Orange," A strange fruit to say the least
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsNatural curiosity is more a reason than any to watch a movie.Having been banned on video for apparently 29 years, A Clockwork Orange,like all the rest,inspires you to watch it if only to see what all the fuss was about.Reservoir Dogs was splendid,The Exorcist was watchable.....but,then again,Natural Born Killers was an unspeakable mess.This film emerges on that unparallel line between uniquely great,and preposterously dreadful.There is,whichever way you look at it,actually very little rhyme or reason to the story of this film.Like in his past overrated disappointment 2001:A Space Odyssey,Kubrick has instead here mesmerised the audience with his own variently effective roleplay on how his orchestra of filming should go.He was capable of great,more reasonably effective work in the past,as The Shining and Full Metal Jacket have proven,while Eyes Wide Shut remains to be seen on my part,but,revolutionary filmmaker he was,it was perhaps slightly unfair of him to expect the audience to swallow his own complicated world view on such astoundingly thin plot material,though the lead young man's journey from an unscrupulous lawbreaker to a dedicated abider of law and order is strangely involving.Yes,again in this scenario,maybe due to the film's age,it's hard to see what all the fuss was about.Which is,in turn,all the worst,leaving you with an unbelievably uneven whole that churns you in for the ride,and endures you in it's inexplicable revelation.**",Null,2,4,28 August 2000

Actually,for such a movie,the big-budget action scenes and special effects are in extremely moderate amount.And the fact that the film is moving so quickly in the first half quickly pays off in the second half when the pace seems to drag a lot and the story (which you begin to wonder when will end!) becomes extremely wavey and futile.But,there you go.The script is okay.And on the casting front,Cage brings his usual snazzy charisma to the lead role,while Diane Kruger supports him well as the heroine.Bean continues to carve a role for himself as a Hollywood villain with this and other roles casting a distinguishable not on his belt,never dumping his Yorkshire accent either (very Sean Connery!)

Reservoir Dogs," A timeless classic
","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs A film telling the tale of the after-math of a botched bank raid by a gang of professional thieves. The rapid alert of the police and word-of-mouth has also drawn the conclusion of an undercover police officer in their midst.Upon it's initial release, this flick caused the biggest stir in movies since The Exorcist. A generally violent, foul-mouthed movie at the best of times featuring the notorious ear-cutting scene. Although having seen it, I can't really see what all the fuss was about. The camera veers away from that shot, whereas in Robocop you saw a man get blasted to bits by a gang of crooks with guns (as well as seeing him writhing in agony whilst they laugh at and taunt him!) and another scene where you see a man's testicles apparently get blown off after an attempted rape, yet to the best of my knowledge that was never banned, or even Candyman 2 where you actually see a man's hand being severed off with a rusty blade whilst similar taunting is going on which was never banned. I suppose the graphic, real shot of the man who's been shot in the stomach at the beginning might have played a big part too, though (in a way, it's certainly a lot more shocking than that scene.) But all that controversy aside, we are dealing with a truly legendary film here. A small, low-budget, art-house production that leaves you more fulfilled than any big-budget, Hollywood production ever could. There is a genuinely impressive, shining quality to the writing, dialogue and story-telling at play here that no doubt cemented Tarantino's ascension to his current glory. Moreover, you can see what are probably the earliest hatchings of the 'reverse-plotting' trend starting here that lead to such films as Memento getting made.All of the cast are excellent, and it can only be the work of the hands of fate that while some went on to really make names for themselves (Tarantino, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi) others (Michael Madsen, Chris Penn) just got delegated to either supporting roles or straight-to-video roles. I suppose if I had to pick particular favourites, they would be Buscemi as the edgy, mechanical brains of the group, and Madsen, who has a quiet, un-nerving edge to him that seems typical of a genuine psychopath.It is basically a film driven by dialogue and atmosphere, with a cracking soundtrack from artists as diverse as Steeler's Wheel to Dolly Parton. It's controversy may have given it a helping hand and the name 'Reservoir Dogs' is never actually explained, but for far better reasons than that, this is a film that deserves never to be forgotten. *****",10,6,13,5 June 2005
Limitless," A wasted opportunity of a film that doesn't develop the right way
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Scruffy looking out of work writer Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) takes his girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) giving him the boot as the final straw in his life heading down the pan. Just when he thinks things can't get any worse, his old brother in law hands him a new designer drug that allegedly has the power to enhance his abilities to their fullest. Regarding it cynically at first, Eddie takes it and finds it to be as true as he was told it was. Living his life to the max, Eddie sees a chance to commercialise on his discovery with Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro) a powerful businessman who sees potential. But when the not so lovely side effects kick in, Eddie finds his world thrust into turmoil.Hollywood is a place where original ideas are running increasingly scarce in the recession era, where only re-makes and sequels to age old franchise films appear to be springing up. So it's always encouraging, in one way or another, for a film like Limitless to spring up, with producers taking a gamble on a new idea that could work wonders. So it's all the more upsetting when the result is something so far fetched, confused and implausible, a film that saunters around without much direction and fails to develop into a film as a whole. It's slick and glossy enough, and the zooming camera moments would give a ride at Alton Towers a run for it's money. But there's really not much more to it than this, with give or take lead performances from Cooper and De Niro, who takes an eternity to make his presence in the film but still fails to give it any extra weight or gravitas, and an enhanced sense that it's on to something special when really it's anything but. **",4,25,47,9 April 2011
Beauty and the Beast," Lacks the all round magic and charm of the animated film
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Belle (Emma Watson) is a young woman who lives in a stiflingly boring little town in France, with a pretty pre-determined future ahead of her. When her eccentric father Maurice (Kevin Kline) goes missing, she tracks him down to an ancient castle, where he's been taken captive by the resident Beast (Dan Stevens), who's been living under a curse imposed by a conjuror who wants him to discover the beauty within himself, and will only be free of it when someone loves him for who he is. He makes Belle take the place of her father, and this sets them both on a course of discovery and magic.It seems to be a current trend for animated Disney classics to be getting live action, what with this and the recent Jungle Book adaptation, and since everything else seems to be getting remade, why not jump on the bandwagon? There is some undeniable potential in a LA version of the animated 1991 Disney film, and Bill Condon has not done a terrible job of doing so, just one that is quite notably devoid of the charm and joy of the original, and can never quite sweep you along with the same sense of wonder.An all star cast, comprised of a load of hot, young talent in the main roles and a load of seasoned, accomplished actors in the supporting roles, add to the veneer and sleekness of it all, and aesthetically it's all very nice. The special effects, costume designs and production values are all marvellous, and combine to create a visually splendorous experience that sets the senses on fire, if nothing else. In spite of this, though, it all just feels like a tepid, watered down version of the original, a definite case of more is less.The stench of wasted potential is hard to blot out. **",4,3,8,11 October 2017
Sicario," Superior film-making with hidden layers that transcends the boundaries
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After a disastrous drug bust on the US/Mexico border left some members of her team dead, Federal Agent Mercer (Kate Winslet, sorry, Emily Blunt) is left feeling disillusioned with the war against drugs, until she is approached by Agent Graver (Josh Brolin) who is setting up a Task Force to go after a big time drug dealer who may have ultimately been behind her teammate's deaths. Assisted by the mysterious Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), she and her close partner Wayne (Daniel Kaluuga) are dragged into a morally skewed, uneven world, where the ends justify the means in the most brutal and unfair of ways, and no one escapes squeaky clean.With an odd title that is explained away at the beginning as meaning 'hitman' in Mexico, Sicario presents itself as a typical action thriller centred in the drug world, albeit one with more emphasis on a hard hitting, no nonsense style of delivery, and in many ways achieves this objective. But Denis Villeneuve's film penetrates much further than this, serving as more of an eye opening, unbiased glimpse into this most murky of worlds. With echoes of Steven Soderbergh's Traffic, and the Italian crime drama Gomorrah, and even the recent Cartel Land, it emerges as a very pleasant surprise and far more than the sum of its parts.It gets by, more than anything, on a silent, moody, lingering atmosphere throughout, that accompanies the unfolding story perfectly. Our unwitting, unsuspecting central protagonists are drawn into a world where terror and misery permeates everything, where there is deep seated unhappiness on every corner, and little hope of anything ever changing, if the excesses of wealthy America continue to channel the demand for exploitation on the other side of the border. There's no nice, neat and tidy happy Hollywood ending to wrap everything up with, just characters who've crossed lines they can't cross back from and seen the ends have justified the means in the most horrific and unthinkable of ways.We're left with a subtle reminder that there's only the promise of more of the same to come, and the cycle of hopelessness is doomed to continue. Sicario promises one thing on the surface, and ends up delivering something far more dynamic and compelling, the latest gritty, no holds barred assault on the doomed war on drugs. ****",9,0,2,15 October 2015
The Descent," A well intentioned but unsuccessful Brit horror movie

However, a shattering secret, revealed once inside the rocky chamber, makes matters take an unexpected, scary turn- and the girls don't appear to be alone in the cave.I wasn't aware that The Descent was a British movie until I started watching it- although I did notice on the front cover it was from Dog Soldiers director Neil Marshall, which should have been a give-away sign, I suppose.This is a movie with potential and one or two neat little scares, but it's all so dimly lit and badly filmed that it ends up detracting from all the good stuff. Plus we have a monster in the shape of something that resembles Gollum out of Lord of the Rings gone bad. And a little like a monster out a scary car advert I saw recently. **",4,2,7,4 February 2006
Inside Man," A film that cheats itself of greatness
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A group of people in plasterers uniforms walk into a busy New York City bank, produce guns and bundle everyone together downstairs. A tense hostage situation has soon developed and Detective Frazier (Denzel Washington) is in charge of keeping everything under control. But the raiders, lead by the devious, condescending Russell Dalton (Clive Owen) aren't making their demands very clear and after a while it seems to all be about something a little more than money.This is sort of an unusual film for Spike Lee to make, and he's done a bit of a Devil's Advocate by using the brilliant Denzel Washington and the rather wooden Clive Owen as co-stars. But Washington, Jodie Foster (although a bit too smug in what is a rather small role), Christopher Plummer and, yes, even would you believe, Owen are all on pretty good form here, delivering great versions of the sort of performances they do best. Plus the film is distinctively Spike Lee all the way, with his trademark use of the camera and delivery style. The film also has a really engrossing story to it, with some great dialogue and soforth.But those are it's good points. The bad news is that it's badly paced, badly edited and as a result the story ends up dragging on a little and becoming a little boring. Some of the plot is badly tied up and doesn't even make sense by the end. As a few other reviewers have said, it's a film that may have tried to be a bit too smart for it's own good and cheated itself of greatness as a result. ***",7,1,1,7 April 2006
Pulp Fiction," A genuine work of genius that changed the face of film-making
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Lovers Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) exchange some dialogue in an American diner before taking their guns out and holding the place up, the latest in a long line of hold ups. Meanwhile, contract killers Vince (John Travolta) and Jules (Samuel L Jackson) also share some clever observations on life, travelling in their car before taking care of two lowlives who have crossed paths with their boss, Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) who at the same time is in his club, persuading down on his luck boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) to throw a fight for him. However, Butch suicidally has other ideas on his mind. In the space of a day, these characters will be drawn together and their fates decided by each other in some way none of them saw coming.In 1991, the world first experienced the genius of Tarantino with his excellent debut feature Reservoir Dogs. But the clever concept and genius writing were over-shadowed by controversy, with the inclusion of a certain scene involving an ear. It says a lot that by the time Pulp Fiction came out, RD was still banned on video. Although it's not zoomed in on quite as much, there's a similarly unpleasant bit in here involving a hillbilly corrupt police officer with a twisted anal perversion, which shows the sickness in the director's mind he is unable to let go of. But, as shocking as these scenes are in each respective film, it's a wonder if all the hoohah they caused was worth it for Tarantino, as his skill as a screen writer and story teller was surely enough to get him by without these nasty inclusions. But they add to the film like everything else and the sickness is as uniquely Tarantino as, well, everything else.This is simply a film by which any others can be compared. It revolutionized film-making in a way no one saw coming, with the delivery of the story and the effortlessly cool dialogue, which had many pretenders to the throne copying it's style long afterward. But the film is simply one in a million, told in a way only Tarantino could have done and as outrageous as only he could be.It also succeeds in having a great cast playing brilliant characters. Travolta, an actor who had been languishing in the wilderness for years (a trait Tarantino would employ for many other long forgotten stars in years to come) and Jackson, who late in his life and career went on to become quite the mega-star for his inclusion in the film, are unforgettable as the ultra savvy, cool, assured hit men forced to lose their trendy suits and look like average surfer dudes by the end of the film. Also, Roth, a British actor whose career was pretty much launched by this, got his shot at the big time here and gave it his all along with character actress Plummer as his trigger happy lover. Willis and Rhames also make memorable roles out of their characters, along with supporting turns from the likes of Uma Thurman as Wallace's coked up failed actress wife and Harvey Keitel as the conspicuous (but bad mannered) 'cleaner' sent to sort out an unfortunate mess Travolta and Jackson get themselves into.A mind blowingly clever and inventive tale, cool, stylish, outrageous and carried along by a savvy soundtrack, including such 70s hits as Let's Stay Together and Son of a Preacher Man, this is simply an unforgettable masterpiece that has stood the test of time. Push comes to shove, I probably preferred Reservoir Dogs but this certainly ain't lagging too far behind it. *****",10,0,3,17 July 2008
Jack Reacher," Intelligent blockbuster that strikes the right balance between brawn and brain
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA group of people are seemingly randomly targeted by a roof top sniper, and it doesn't take long for the powers that be to point the finger at former war veteran James Barr (Joseph Sikora) who asks for the help of only one man: Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), a man with much specialist experience who officially doesn't exist. Initially, though, he seems convinced of Barr's guilt, with only determined young attorney Helen (Rosamund Pike) fighting his corner. But as she and Reacher dig deeper in to the circumstances surrounding Barr's arrest, they uncover a tangled web of conspiracy that puts them both in the firing line.I've never read any of Lee Child's 'Jack Reacher' novels, but it's testament to what a dedicated fan base they must have that there was much consternation at the lead role being given to mega star Tom Cruise, who apparently was unsuited to it on account of his miniature size, with the novel version being notedly taller. While it's understandable the fans might be up in arms at something like this, it might have been a shame if someone else had been given the role, because this is one of those roles where Cruise steps out of that 'movie star' persona his name always seems to generate, and is genuinely rugged and convincing in a strong, silent type role that requires him to be one of those 'outsider' types who's more of a force to be reckoned with than anyone could let on.While with Cruise involved it inevitably becomes about spectacle and scope, Jack Reacher is still an intelligent and intricate adventure, full of twists, turns and red herrings, that doesn't play out the way you expect it to and is all the more of a thrilling experience because of it. In the midst of it's intelligence, it also aims to be relevant and topical, with references in the story to rooftop snipers and unbalanced war veterans, which are probably very much hot potato matters in American society today. While catching us out with this unexpected depth and substance, director Christopher McQuarrie, who's behind the camera for the first time again after twelve years since 2000's Way of the Gun, never lets up of the thrilling action, including at least a couple of exciting car chases, the odd injection of exciting hand to hand combat and a neat little shoot out battle at the end.While fans of the books may have quite a big thing to nit pick about, the casual viewer will be in for an explosive, thrilling ride that also has the good grace never to insult it's audience's intelligence. ****",9,10,16,22 July 2013

Desperate to keep his fingers, him and his friends agree to rob a gang that are about to rob a gang of local drug dealers.

But the plot doesn't flow as smoothly here and it's filmed through-out in a really dinghy use of the camera that didn't appeal. Not to mention an ending that feels like it's dragging on somewhat.A good film, then, very stylish and quite clever, but Ritchie was to make a more digestible and enjoyable film a few years later with Snatch.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Epic, flashy sequel that is still not quite as good as the first one
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning This sequel to 2014's monster comic book fantasy hit Guardians of the Galaxy delves further into the back story of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), the young boy abducted from Earth by Yondu (Michael Rooker) after his mother succumbed to cancer. Here, he is re-united with his father (Kurt Russell) who disappeared from his life and became the inter-galactic warrior Ego, who inhabits his own corner of the universe. His son, meanwhile, continues to be known as Star-Lord and, as he and his ragtag misfit friends, including Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket the Racoon and Baby Groot go about their missions, they uncover a sinister truth that could tear them all apart.The big screen comic book craze is certainly not one that's showing any signs of dying down, but of the last few years, none has quite sent it into such a spin as James Gunn's 2014 blockbuster GOTG. This sequel was practically a cat in the bag in terms of being made, and the fans of the last one have certainly been waiting for it (as the packed theatre I was in would attest to. ) It pretty much repeats the formula of the last one to wise effect, and with Gunn back at the helm, hopes were really as great as they can be. What it does try and do is do it all on a bigger, grander scale and while this is visually impressive and aesthetically stimulating, somehow it's all a bit too much and just not quite as good as the last one.The 80's throwback vibe is on higher alert, with David Hasselhoff frequently referenced (and even making a brief cameo!) as the image presented of Quill's father, on account of him being a big Knight Rider fan, whilst even Howard the Duck himself no-less appears in one segment. This is often used to enhance the humour, which it does, though it even creeps up uneasily during darker moments of the film, such as when Peter learns the truth behind his mother's death. The big theme here is exploring the back stories of each of the characters, and what springs off this is a load of subplots, that are interesting but don't have a massive connection to each other, and so what we do have is a long, slightly incoherent film.Fundamentally, though, it does faithfully stick to the formula from last time, with some hilariously funny moments, and a soundtrack listing that is actually better than the last one (including a wonderful opening involving a shoot-out to the tune of ELO's marvellous Mr. Blue Sky.) It is a visual splendour to watch, too, that even Mr Sylvester Stallone seemed to want to get on board with. ***",7,3,7,4 May 2017
The Da Vinci Code," A case of 'if you want the best experience, read the book'
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A curator is murdered in Paris's revered Louvre Museum. The French police, headed by Leutenant Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) call on the expertise of Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), an expert in Pagan Symbols, when mysterious, blood-drenched patterns are found all over the body. However, Fache's suspicions of Robert have already been aroused and, unbeknownst to the professor, he's slipped a tracking device on him. Then Agent Nevu (Audrey Tautou) intervenes, springs him from the museum and begins a wild chase around Paris full of wild twists and turns. Robert learns the curator was Nevu's grand-father and was involved with a religious sect called The Priory of Sion. It all leads to a monk, Silas (Paul Bettany) sent by the religious sect of Opus Dei and the ultimate re-writing of history.There's nothing like controversy to get something talked about, and it seems the best results are when that controversy involves religion. Dan Brown's much talked about novel The Da Vinci Code set off much consternation by basically re-writing the bible- and now that controversy has been adapted to the big screen.The book suffered from trite dialogue but still managed to be a relentless page turner that fired at you with interesting fact after interesting fact and kept you on the edge of your seat till the last page. The film adaptation, then, is as good as can be expected. It's well cast. Tom Hanks is just the kind of lead you need for this kind of thing, but he's not at his best here. Jean Reno also has appeal as Captain Fache (strangely, though, I'd always pictured Michael Gambon in the role!) Tautou and Bettany are also very engaging in support but it's Ian McKellen who steals the show here as eccentric old grail enthusiast Sir Leigh Leabing, delivering the most spirited and compelling performance. And it has a reliable director in Ron Howard. But if you've read the book, the film offers little in the way of it's own variation on the story and pretty much just plays it like it was in the book, making it a bit of a dull and unsurprising thing after a while. If you haven't read the book, do so, it'll be much more rewarding. ***",7,14,27,15 June 2006
Thor," Nonsensical comic book yarn, carrying itself with a serious tone that it doesn't warrant

Anyway, he crash lands on earth, where he happens upon young researcher Jane (Natalie Portman) and her father Erik (Stellan Skarsgard) who are having their own problems with some local government bureaucrats, which makes him come in handy when he forms a friendship with them after they teach him about earth ways and customs. Meanwhile, back on his home planet, his jealous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) assumes the throne when Odin dies, setting Thor on a course to return home and begin a battle to the death that will encompass both planets.Kenneth Branagh is a name that appears to have disappeared to the sidelines in the movie art form, with me last hearing of his name in his initial home of the theatre in some production he was doing there. Here, he appears to have done a bit of a Clint Eastwood and stayed out of view behind the camera, where he's graced this production with his particular style of pomp and grandiose directing. Within the medium of the comic book film, from the iconic Marvel chain line and borrowing from the ancient Greek mythical character, he is in his element, with all the right ingredients to make this the marvellous romp it could have been. Something just falls flat with Thor, though, never coming to life or working as the great fun it could have been.Even by comic book film standards, this is complete nonsense, not helped by a distinctly humourless streak and a camera man who can't seem to hold it at a straight angle at various important shots in the film. As the titular Thor, Hemsworth carries the role decently enough, with a dashing arrogance that the role requires, whilst Hopkins invests an energy and gusto into his role that doesn't really fit the material. None of the supporting cast, from Portman to Skarsgard, are bad, either, it's just this is one big, lumbering mess of a film, with a bone headed steak that is the biggest surprise of all from the refined Branagh. **",Null,1,3,18 October 2011
The Shape of Water," Guillermo del Toro delivers another dazzling fantasy, this time with a powerful heart
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningElisa (Sally Hawkins) is a mute woman, only able to communicate through sign language. The only person who really understands her is her friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer), who works with her as a cleaner at a top secret research facility, where experiments are being carried out on the otherworldly Amphibian Man (Doug Jones.) Elisa comes to form a bond with this beautiful creature and becomes involved in a plot to break him free, setting her on a path with Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), a ruthless senior employee at the place she works.Guillermo del Toro returns out of nowhere, writing and directing this whimsical little slice of fantasy that further showcases his talents as a filmmaker. After becoming known for action adventure fantasies, such as the Hellboy films and Pan's Labyrinth, here he delivers something with more of a beating emotional heart at its core, that seems to have an equalities agenda beating at its heart, with a lead character who uses sign language, living with a closet homosexual, and being best friends with a woman of colour, at a time when this group in society were stuck in menial, dead end jobs they had little hope of getting out of, whilst straight white men really ruled the world. In spite of the typically incredible special effects job done on the Amphibian Man, which don't forget to give him the sweetest, most endearing facial features, its the performances that drive the film, and in the lead role, Hawkins is perfectly cast evoking the right amount of empathy, vulnerability and compassion from this character, making her at times feel even more alien than the creature. By contrast, Shannon, although playing to type, is no less cold and scary as the unfeeling authoritarian determined to keep everything in his twisted version of order.
If you can overlook the blatant political correctness, a tiresome and not entirely necessary subplot involving Russian espionage, and the ambiguous but no doubt unwholesome definition of what a woman having sex with some alien thing could be called (beasteality?!?), then this is a stirring and sensational piece of work that, as well as being a dazzling visual experience, perfectly challenges the social attitudes and prejudices of its early 1960s setting. ****",9,2,5,7 August 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Easily the runt of the litter
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits It is the late 1970s and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is now the aging head of the Corleone empire. All is flowing smoothly until a younger relative of his, Vincent (Andy Garcia) arrives on the scene. Vincent is hot-headed, acting without thinking and Michael can see this as a problem that may affect the Corleone family. Then he decides to buy a major corporation's share in the church, cutting off his ties with the casinos and soforth. This rubs some other prominent gangsters up the wrong way and from here we watch Michael's dramatic fall from power in a devastating event of power games.In 1990, Martin Scorsese brought us a gangster movie to herald a new era in the shape of Goodfellas that many, both artistically and casually, would want to emulate. One can only get the impression Francis Ford Coppola wanted to cling to his title as the maker of the most memorable gangster epic of all time by reminding us of it by dealing us The Godfather Part III, which can hold claim to being possibly the most unnecessary and even damaging prequel of all time.Right from the very beginning, it is clear how transparent the film is, as possibly without even realizing it, it is copying the first film by having a long family gathering sequence where Pacino (stepping in for Brando) cuts away to have some behind the scenes discussions right up to the scene where his character is rushed to hospital, again like the original. This may well have been the mark of Coppola's career freefall, starting the chart of a sad decline in a once brilliant director.You've lost interest in the story long before the ending, leaving it to just ramble on towards it's eventual conclusion. The story's fairly interesting and there is one scene of brilliant emotional acting by Pacino (even with this sort of material, you gotta admire the guy!) but the whole film cannot help but feel like a big, embarrassing dirty stain on the two unforgettable films made two decades earlier. With the flashy, trend-setting new film Goodfellas on the scene, I can't imagine cinema-goers in 1990 would have much time for this unneeded drag. **",4,6,13,12 February 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Better than I had any right to expect it to be,if not slightly better
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsHaving been underwhelmed by the highly praised original The Matrix in 1999,the prospect of the sequel didn't exactly thrill me beyond measure.Alas,because of the hugely successful flick it was,the sequel was inevitable (for financial reasons,more than anything) and now,four years later,we have it.At least it's not being resurrected from an old franchise like the majority of big flicks this year seem to be,but that's not guaranteed quality control.Alas,it cannot be denied,this is a hugely entertaining and worthwhile action adventure,with some amazing action/wire-fu sequences,a mesmerizing visual feel,an absorbing soundtrack and some unexpectedly brilliant dialogue.If only it weren't for a humourless Laurence Fishburne and a story that is simply too far fetched and fantastical to bother following,let alone care about.With the sequel coming later in the year though,it certainly knows something about continuity.Or profit.***",Null,0,2,16 July 2003
Mystic River," This River runs deep
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsGoing to back to my comments on Blood Work,where I said that perhaps it was time for Clint to retire.I'd now like to edit that a little,if I may.Perhaps he should take a back seater to leading parts in films,but if he can still manage to helm fine quality filmic material such as this,perhaps total senility hasn't kicked in.This is the tale of three childhood friends,Jimmy,Dave and Sean.One day,an unfortunate encounter leads to Dave being abducted and mentally scared for the rest of his life.Just under thirty years later,the trio,still living in their childhood home town of Boston,Massachusetts,are reunited under more tragic circumstances.Jimmy (Sean Penn) and Dave (Tim Robbins) have remained close friends but Sean (Kevin Bacon) has drifted apart from the gang and become a homicide detective.His job position,however,is about to play a pivitol role in the tragic circumstances that are about to unfold,when Sean's teenage daughter is viciously murdered.This has a devastating effect not only directly on Sean and his family,but on the local community as a whole.More devastating revelations are made,however,as Sean and his partner Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne) conduct their investigations and uncover evidence that ends up pointing the finger directly at Dave.As Sean struggles to contend with these new findings,the three childhood best friends find themselves inexplicably drawn back together once more to confront not only the present nightmare engulfing all their lives,but events from the past that start to crop their ugly heads up once more.This is a very deep and intelligent film,which puts a whole new slant on the modern variation of the murder mystery genre and,perhaps unsurprisingly,has found itself the subject of only a limited release in amongst all the bloated,insincere eye candy 2003 has found itself laden with (just shows how much audiences respect their own intelligence,don't it?).Eastwood's direction is stylish and absorbing,another film of his from the legendary Malpaso company,who produced that unforgettable hit of his so many years ago.The performances from all concerned are brilliant and highly emotive.The ending is unpredictable,well scripted and powerfully raw.Much like the majority of the film,really,just especially so.It's perhaps one notch off perfect.The trauma Dave suffered as a child perhaps could have been played on a bit more.But it is a hugely brilliant idea for a film,very inspired and highly worth your time.And,as an aside,so deep you could probably end up drowning in it.****",Null,5,9,7 November 2003
Zombieland," Above average horror comedy
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In a post apocalyptic world in the not too distant future, Earth has been taken over by zombies and formerly nerdy kid Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has had to buff up to fight off the maurauding masses. He crosses paths with Tallahasse (Woody Harrelson) a naturally tough, no nonsense redneck with his own demons to fight (on the inside.) But they soon find themselves in a battle of wits with two sisters, the older, beautiful Wichita (Emma Stone) and her feisty younger sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) before they figure it'll work better to work together...The zombie movie franchise is alive and booming at the moment, both played straight with the new batch George A. Romero keeps dropping out and in terms of serving as spoof fodder, since the formula is so familiar. So much so that Zombieland keeps serving up self referential quips, with the rules that Columbus has established for himself constantly flipping up on screen in order of how he thought them up, which do have a bearing with how characters tend to survive in these sorts of films. Although it isn't a brilliant film, it somehow worked for me much more than the over rated Shaun of the Dead.Cast wise, Harrelson could carry the role of the tough, grizzly redneck in his sleep, constantly cracking wise and at one point revealing an unexpected, dramatic trauma from his past that's as out of nowhere (and sort of out of place) as a similar scene in the aforementioned SOTD. Otherwise, Stone is sexy and sassy as Wichita. Eisenberg and Breslin are decent in their roles, but are secondary to the two I could write home about in a film with such a short cast list.Short and sweet at 81 minutes, this is a forgettable but worthwhile send up, better than SOTD or even the more recent British counterpart Doghouse. ***",7,0,0,25 March 2010
Enemy at the Gates," Uninvolving WW2 actioner
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsEnemy at the Gates is a hugely disappointing war/action flick.With a talented cast,impressive director and an intriguing premise,it is such a let down that the end result is such a meandering,boring mess.The opening battle scene had potential,like a lot of other things with this flick did,but it appears strangely tatty and cardboardish.The remaining action sequences throughout the film are too slow moving and droll to really appeal to anybody .The end showdown between the two main characters has an impressive air and substance to it,but is so anti-climatic it ruins it all.Jean Jaques Annaud's direction is overly stretched out and the film is painfully overlong running over the two hour mark.On the performances front,Josepth Fiennes is a poor man's Ben Kingsley in Schindler's List,Jude Law is an unappealing action man,Ed Harris turns in an especially blank,stationary peformance as the bad guy and Bob Hoskins is completely unrecognisable as a Russian commanderAnd we leave off in the end in doubt as to whether this is a true story or not.If it is,then maybe real life is more boring than the movies.**",Null,1,4,28 August 2001

Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Even with it's tongue in it's cheek, not very enjoyable...
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits After meeting and starting a fiery romance in Bogata, Columbia, John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) are now a happily married suburban couple going on for five years of marriage. But then they learn that they are both, well, secret agents and that their next assignments is to, well, kill each other. Cue complications and comedic capers from there...Nothing gets a bad film rolling quite like publicity. Especially when that publicity becomes bigger than the actual film itself. The publicity in this case being the supposed 'Brad and Angelina' romance that sparked up on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith, rumoured to being behind the big tabloidy break-up of Hollywood golden couple Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. No doubt Mr & Mrs Smith has raked in considerable takings at the box office as a result. And it seems all the bad reviews and the actual poor quality of the film can't change that...I'm not sure if it was aware of it or not, but the whole thing just seems like some big spin on Schwarzenegger's 1994 hit True Lies. But nowhere near the quality. As events roll on, the absurdity of the plot just gets at you so much, you really know this is a part-comedic film with it's tongue in it's cheek, but the stupidity of it all reeks just the same. The action itself is a collection of the usual loud bangs and thuds that we've been seeing in movies lately. Interspersed in one of these scenes is a supposedly 'comedic' bit, where Pitt and Jolie engage in some hand-to-hand combat in their home, where you can't help but think of the growing amount of domestic abuse cases in the country and how some weak-minded individual may see that and be tempted to go home one night and re-enact some of that on their spouse. There is a disturbingly casual attitude to violence and aggression hinted at throughout the entire film, but that is the one that stuck in my mind the hardest.Performances wise, Pitt is his usual wooden self and Vince Vaughn is incredibly irritating as his on-screen buddy. Adam Brody is an impressively sarcastic villain and Jolie has an incredibly sultry, sexy presence to her (as usual), but doesn't really rise to any great heights in her role.Overall, this is a daft, unfunny and pretty unsuccessful film that, for the most part, just fails miserably to do anything right and has only done as well as it has by falling on the band-wagon of all the superfluous off-screen publicity it's two leading stars have generated between them. **",4,2,4,7 July 2005
The Departed," A tour de force! Scorsese's best film of this sort since GoodFellas
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Two hot young new recruits join the FBI in the shape of Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon.) After a tough, unrelenting grilling, they both get the posts- and end up doing different jobs on the same assignment. A major operation has been set up to bring down revered local crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) who's just masterminded a heist on a military base where loads of tiny micro chip processors have been stolen to be sold to the Chinese to launch a deadly missile into the air. Costigan is sent undercover to infiltrate Costello's gang whilst Sullivan helps lead the operation to bring him down. But along the way it becomes a deadly and uncertain game where no one is who they seem, no one's motives are as clear as they appear and, increasingly, no one can be trusted.With his latest movie, Scorsese has returned to his staple favourite, the gangster movie, and defiantly issued a message that if you thought Good Fellas was brutal and hard-hitting, you ain't seen nothing till you've seen The Departed. And that would be a pretty accurate assessment. But aside from matching GoodFellas in the brutality stakes, TD also matches it in terms of all round, well, general quality. This is one of the most thoroughly satisfying and totally excellent films I've seen this year, an absorbing and mesmerizing tale that never lets up from beginning to end.As the main bad guy, Nicholson is at his absolute best (and that ain't no bad thing) doing his coolly edgy and unnerving act to brilliant effect and to be fair the supporting cast don't fu*k up either. Damon, Di Caprio, Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and even cockney heavy Ray Winstone, in his breakthrough to Hollywood role as Costello's thoroughly brutal right-hand man, are all thoroughly immersed in their roles and make each respective part shine to their best effect.It's actually nastier with the vulgarity of the language used by Nicholson's mobster (especially some of the explicit jibes he comes out with regarding women) but yes this is also one mega violent film that those with faint hearts might want to avoid. Yes, it's all rather frequent and excessive but it's a blessing and a curse because it also succeeds in giving the film a much needed loud, raw, intense feel that fits the mood of the picture brilliantly. And it should also be commended for managing to skillfully combine this seedier side of the film with a genuinely intelligent plot with many skillful twists and turns that you never see coming. Indeed, as the end draws near, it's veered away from it's mobster movie staple a bit and become more of an L.A. Confidential type film of police corruption and double crossing.It's become a little depressing by the end too, with all but two of the most obnoxious main characters meeting nasty, blood-splattered deaths at the hands of a gun. But, hey, this is a gangster film and at least the worst villains got their just desserts fittingly. And what a gangster film it is too, one of the finest and most memorable we've seen in a while, everything coming together perfectly to make a fantastic cinematic experience. *****",10,1,8,25 October 2006
Die Hard," Still regarded as the quintessential action movie twenty five years on
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAs Christmas Eve looms in Los Angeles, New York detective John McClaine (Bruce Willis) arrives to meet his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedilia) at the Nakatomi Plaza. All is going smoothly enough, until a group of terrorists lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) seize control of the building and take everyone inside hostage-all except McClaine, who takes the terrorists on at their own game, in a deadly duel to the death.The 80's was the decade where the last of the great big ideas were brewing, where the studios thought big and delivered bigger, where concepts became franchises and true artistic integrity became a distinct after thought. That's not to say most of the ideas weren't truly inspired, and didn't have the potential to become big investments. Trouble is, the last year in that decade is now very nearly twenty five years ago, leaving the time period itself very much as a thing of the ages. But it is now twenty five years since Die Hard burst on to the scene, and to it's credit, is still hailed by many after all that time as the definitive action film which set the standard by which all others are measured and of which countless imitations have been made. If nothing else, watching it again will wash the memory of that Godawful new film released earlier this year out your mind and remind you of the joyful, exhilarating spectacle that inspired the series in the first place.Bruce Willis made his name with this role, making it all his own and putting his stamp all over it as the cynical, gnarly detective who proves a one man battle machine for the villains he's engaged with. The massive appeal here is almost certainly his presence as an every-man the average, predominantly male action fan could probably relate to, having been force-fed the impossible image through-out the 80's of the muscle bound, mumbling killing machine they could never live up to. McClaine is totally believable as a resourceful but bewildered man of the law thrown in to a situation he wasn't expecting, while Rickman as his adversary is restrained, jovial but also utterly cold and ruthless, determined to see his plan through to the end. Between them, they are a brilliantly twisted double act.Some ideas are so good, and are executed so faultlessly, they deserve to become profitable institutions, spinning off with other versions and sequels, being imitated many times and still holding a special place in everyone's heart twenty five years on. Die Hard is full of explosive, exciting action, is brilliantly written, with great characters, fine dialogue and even finer set pieces. And all that aside, it's just great fun. It's success really speaks for itself. *****",10,3,3,25 June 2013
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Everything you'll love if you thought the first was great...as below average as the last for everyone else
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning I'm used to describing the plot at this point in my reviews. But Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has achieved the unthinkable...a 150 minute long film that had a plot that was both too vague to really make out and which I just could not care enough about to follow anyway. How it managed to sustain my attention for this long without me falling asleep I can only attribute to having a vague memory of the major disappointment that was the live action original, which was basically a load of noise and effects that I was able to take in just for the big let down that it was as a huge fan of the animated show as a kid. But, it got the right publicity (if not the greatest reviews) and these kinds of films always tend to do well at the box office with this behind them. And so, action auteur Michael Bay has gone and delivered a sequel that copies the formula of the first film exactly...and inherets all the same problems. What I'm basically saying is, if you're the undemanding kind that loved the first one, you'll have a great time. If you thought it fell below average, it'll be the same flashy but empty experience. And God help you if you hated the first one...This sequel is every bit as soulless, empty and insincere as the first film, a good twenty minutes-to half an hour overlong to rub salt in the wounds. The writing, dialogue, story and acting (including Megan Fox delivering an appearance where her body and looks are clearly being sold more than her thesping) are all abysmal, and I think it would be hard even for an under twelve year old not to notice it at times. It's a none stop assault of great special effects and explosive action, culminating in a giant showdown at the Egyptian pyramids at the end that's technically amazing but just...all goes completely over your head. It'll do for a lot of movie goers nowadays but I'm glad I go for quality more than quantity. **",4,1,7,15 March 2010
The Witch," Brave, ambitious horror film-making, which may be lost to some
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 1630, rural England. A devout Christian family find themselves banished by the elders of their local community, on account of their father William's (Ralph Ineson) puritanical, uncompromising religious ways, into the wilderness. They set up a home in the forest, and live their lives strictly in accordance with the teachings of the Bible. But then, a mysterious curse seems to befall them, where their crops fail and the infant child of the family disappears into thin air. The family find their dynamics closing in on each other, with accusations flying around, culminating in daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy) being accused of practising witchcraft.Of all the genres, in recent times, horror is probably a strong contender for the one that's become the most stale and stagnant, a field that's become over loaded with remakes or original work that's highly derivative of other works that's gone before, and it's all become pretty samey and interchangeable. And so it's refreshing, at least, that feature length debut director Robert Eggers has delivered something like The Witch, a period horror piece that takes us back to the times of Ye Olde England, and drowns us in dialogue that recreates to a tee the spoken dialect of the time, a move that will wrap up and captivate many, and will sadly make it impenetrable for just as many others.If the dialogue and text is something the average viewer might struggle to get their head around, one thing that will manage to appeal to horror aficionados of all ranges is the beautiful, perfectly creepy and unsettling sense of atmosphere, with the dense, barren forest and the thick, glimmering mist used to beautifully haunting, spooky effect, complimented by a soundtrack that jeeps and jars at just the right times for maximum effect. In the lead role, Ineson's gravelly Yorkshire drawl lends his spoken dialogue an added air of vitality. The climax sacrifices solving the mystery of the missing child for something more startling and ambiguous.In an age where the average horror flick seems to think frequent jump scares, excessive gore, young teen stars with questionable acting skills being chased and a whiny grunge soundtrack playing over the end credits is enough, it's certainly a breath of fresh air for something like The Witch to come along, and receive a lot of the acclaim it has. And deservedly so, if only so much of the historical recreation wouldn't have proved so overwhelming to so many. ****",9,1,4,27 February 2017
Jersey Boys," Eastwood applies his usual polished touch to this re-creation of one of the great pop bands
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Frankie Casstalucio (John Lloyd Young) is a young man in New Jersey, who ekes out a living as a hair-dresser, but who possesses an incredible, falsetto voice that reduces grown men (such as local mobster Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken)) to tears. Stuck with two bit hustler friends, headed by local loudmouth Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza), he has the option to follow their example and head in and out of prison all the time, or really make something of his life. Which, thankfully, he did, and the film charts his triumphs, tragedies and adventures as part of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.Of all the iconic bands, that were part of the 'golden age' of music, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons were easily the most 'marmite' of the lot of them (you loved them or hated them.) Either Valli's shrieking, ear-piercing falsetto voice is music to your ears, or the sort of thing they should use at Guantanamo Bay. Personally, given it was all music well before my time, they must have been something special to really stand out and have so many songs that I loved. And it seems others think the same way, since the hit Broadway musical this is based on has been such an astronomical success, and still enjoys tours nationally to this day (not to mention the up-coming tour Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons themselves will be doing this summer, even in their eighties, probably on the back of all that.). And so, Clint Eastwood, no less, has seen fit to adapt it into this film presentation.Adapting it from a musical is a risky strategy, though. As a result, the pace of the story-telling rubs off on the screen, and some of the character's (most notably Piazza's Tommy DeVito) come off somewhat larger than life, which affects the tone of the drama. That's not to say it's any less affecting, when it wants to be, and that the young cast don't do a great job of re-creating the young men in their prime. Eastwood has shown typical shrewdness by casting a group of unknowns, so that the legend of Valli and his cohorts aren't over shadowed by the presence of any modern day hunks.For those that prefer the story captured on screen rather than stage, Eastwood, who maybe had an affection for the band nobody ever knew about, has applied his usual deft touch and delivered something that gets it just right. ****",9,0,1,10 May 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," Thorough, absorbing but demanding (maybe over so) true life account
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningEven after the tenth anniversary of 9/11 hadn't quite approached, I can still remember the jubilation and news domination of Osama bin Laden's demise at the hand of the US army unit that took him out. To this day, in the mind's of many, it's still incomprehensible that the American military, with all it's might, couldn't find a guy living in a cave, and that it took so long, and so much man power. I suppose it is one of those things where you'd think to yourself what a great movie it would have made. After making an account of the first consequence of the 9/11 attacks, in the shape of war drama The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow here invests a lot of time and energy in to this account of the hunt for bin Laden, an epic saga that fundamentally holds your attention, but not, necessarily, for nearly three hours.We open with CIA interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke) putting a captured suspect through his paces, setting an uneasy opening demonstrating the uncompromising American resolve for answers. Enter our main character Maya (Jessica Chastain), recruited straight out of high school, observing these methods for her training, and agreeing with their effectiveness as a means to an ends. From here, she sticks with the program through thick and thin, gaining experience and intelligence, using her new found skills to help eliminate terrorist cells and capture suspects, before setting her sights on the biggest test of all- capturing Osama bin Laden, the big daddy of Al Qaeda.The film takes a gamble by casting two relative unknowns in the lead roles, while sidelining more prominent acting talent, such as Mark Strong and the late James Gandolfini in basically cameos. With this in mind, it's certainly a blessing that it elicits a strong performance from Chastain as the driven, no nonsense under graduate who becomes even more fierce, wanting bin Laden's blood rather than merely his capture, after losing a friend to a suicide bombing. The performances certainly not being a problem, the trouble is the film's over reliance on the current trend of constantly skipping back/forward in time and outlining it on the screen, as well as giving titles to each new chapter. Somehow, it makes an already complex and very demanding story even more laborious , especially so with it's length in mind.It's a story that demanded to be told, which the movie going public and anyone interested in world affairs would have a natural interest in, and Bigelow has probably done as good a job as could be hoped with this story. You're just left wondering what it would have took to have managed a perfect adaptation. ***",7,1,3,3 September 2013
War of the Worlds," Tom Cruise saves the world...again!!!
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) is a disgruntled dock worker who's got custody of his kids for a while and is planning to spend his time with them wisely. He goes out his house a minute and notices an unusually fearsome looking weather-cloud. At first unfazed, some freak weather conditions later and it is just the beginning of the nightmare that is to come involving cracks in the ground, mass hysteria and giant android machines that will destruct everything in their path. The planets have been at peace for too long- soon the 'war of the worlds' will begin...It's summer. Time for the 'blockbuster' period to begin. And what would it all be without 'blockbuster' favourite Tom Cruise and directing favourite Steven Spielberg and their contribution to the genre, in this case an adaptation of the classic HG Wells novel? Like many re-makes before it, I've not seen the original (well before my time, I'm afraid!) and so I suppose that's a blessing in a way as I'm able to review this version more objectively without comparing it to it's predecessor too much. In terms of quality, it for all intents and purposes does little more than serve it's function as a 'summer blockbuster', with some excellent special effects and certainly not in the way of anything else, in the shape of some dreary human drama and a perfunctory script. It's been in the papers how a famous cabinet minister (or something?) has promised to have the British film censors heads on a platter after the film received a 12A certificate on account of the shocking? violence the film contains. There are some edgy scenes where people get vaporized to bits in front of the camera, but they are not overly shocking and the full extent of the brutality is not shown. In terms of things to think about, the film pushes the 'we're arrogant to think we're alone in the universe' message and it hits a true note...On the performances front, Cruise is serviceable in the lead role but there were moments in this film that caused me to have flashbacks to his days as a teen heart-throb and left me wondering if he'd really matured enough in all that time to take on roles like this. But the absolute star of the show without a shadow of a doubt is Dakota Fanning as his daughter. You'll either find her perfectly precocious (as I did!) or find her heart-warmingly cute, but either way her role works and she is the film's second biggest saving grace. This is a girl who'll be remembered as a brilliant child star and should go on to even greater things in later years. In a co-starring role (some may even call it a cameo!) Tim Robbins has a slightly un-nerving turn as a man who lives on a farm. Spielberg manages some tense scenes but mostly just provides standard direction for this kind of thingOverall, War of the Worlds is a 'summer blockbuster' starring Tom Cruise and directed by Steven Spielberg and little more. It's that time of the year again, and you should just expect films like this to come by. Ten years ago, I might have found this film more than enough to suffice, but now I'm older and a bit more, er, 'critical' of what I see, that's all it is to me. ***",7,2,6,5 July 2005
Love Actually," Alright,actually
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsChristmas 2003,for me,anyway,has got to rank among the most excruciating experiences in my meagre 20 years on this planet.It was that time of the year again and boy did the message seem to be plugged to me,in a year when I just really wasn't in the mood.It seemed no matter where I went or what I did,there was no escape from the festive pluggings in all their forms and glory,more so than any other year I can remember.Not only that,but everyone seemed to keep going on about the countdown to add insult to injury.Love Actually appears to have interpreted my (and possibly other peoples) frustration and,as the story progresses,has included banners indicating the countdown to December 25th starting from the five week mark point and progressing downwards from there.The film has a Pulp Fiction esque feel to it by focusing on not just one main storyline but an interwining series of them,all seemingly revolving around how love is the ultimate binding force of the universe and how at Christmas,the time of peace and goodwill to all men,this sentiment should especially shine through.We open with Hugh Grant's Prime Minister,the main character,telling us how 'people can find the most love at airports' as this is a main greeting area where people come to meet and say goodbye to people they love.Hmmm,very intuitive.Said PM has a thing for his new tea lady (Martine McCutcheon) and spends the film working towards the outcome of this fancy.Photographer Liam Neeson has recently lost his wife and has to help his young son get the girl he fancies at school.Colin Firth plays a man trying to get the Spanish girl he's dating to marry him.Laura Linney plays.....a character whose purpose I was unsure of throughout the film.Emma Thompson plays the PM's secretary and personal assistant.Alan Rickman is her grumpy husband.Keira Knightley is the love interest of a man who's best friend she's married to.Bill Nighy plays an ageing rock star,so warbled in his mind on account of years of heroin abuse who's trying to hit the Christmas No.1 spot with one of the worst,most laughable songs ever.And there's a bizarre cameo appearance from Rowan Atkinson as a jewellery store assistant who inconvieniently faffs about too much,causing various inconvienience to different people.Grant's character is almost certainly a parody of Tony Blair right down to a tee,with his overbearing niceness and constant cheesy grinning and this especially comes to light in a scene featuring Billy Bob Thornton in a cameo as the American president.They're taking the p**s as,during a press conference,he tells the president exactly what he thinks of his policy and where to shove it.This was almost certainly making a statement of how everyone didn't think that this was the true of the real PM Blair,and how they seemed to perceive him as doing a lot of gutless pandering to the real American president George Bush during the year of the war with Iraq.In the leading role,he carries the film in the way he's carried films of a similar ilk that he's been the leading star of in the past,but is ultimately unremarkable.McCutcheon's certainly worked hard to get roles in films like this,but she still has a little way to go to prove she has what it takes to send her career to even greater levels,unlike co-star Knightley who is both exceptionally pretty and carries a natural charm throughout.Many of the other head-billed cast members do well in their roles too,especially Neeson,Nighy as a milder version of Ozzy Osbourne and,Atkinson,bringing his usual quirky comic charm to what is essentially only a walk-on part.The film itself is not particularly funny or charming in any way,but it does carry an engaging enough concept.And the soundtrack ain't bad either.***",Null,0,2,31 January 2004
12 Years a Slave," Strong, compelling film-making, with it's fair share of shocks and surprises
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThe true life tale of Solomon Northrup (Chweitel Ejiofor), a respectable black member of high society, who nonetheless finds himself thrust in to the world of slavery in 1841, America. The film follows his transfer from the more subdued slave-owner Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) to the more ferocious, unscrupulous Epps (Michael Fassbender), through to his eventual salvation when he is rescued by those who knew him.Possibly one of the strongest contenders at the Oscars this year, Brit director Steve McQueen once again brings the historical shame that is slavery to the forefront with this adaptation of the titular character's account of his degeneration from a high position in the world, to his degradation as a servant to the whims of his various twisted masters. Such strong, emotionally driven material is a natural shue-in for the highest honours, and does indeed provide an enthralling production all the way. Rather than having a central protagonist from a poor, impoverished background, this is a shattering highlight of how even an esteemed, respectable black man from those times was prone to being rounded up and forced against his will to serve at his master's feet. If the premise of the story isn't harrowing enough, the film is visually, graphically unflinching also when it comes to depicting the vicious, scarring whippings and beatings the captives were given to keep them in order.A strong, commanding central performance is a must here, and Ejiofor more than fails to disappoint, in what will probably be one of, if not the most, high profile leading role of his career, with current Brit super talents Cumberbatch and Fassbender in respective roles as Solomon's owners, along with a colourful supporting cast that includes Paul Dano, Brad Pitt and Paul Giamatti in roles that don't get the most screen time, but make no less impact. It's a testament to the human spirit that it's a true life story that has that rarest of real life things, a happy ending, unneeded for a manufactured one to be dreamed up by Hollywood that would probably have produced less of an emotional pay off.This is still powerful, dynamic film making, charged along with strong performances and a stirring emotional theme. *****",10,0,1,3 June 2014
Sausage Party," A good idea, but doesn't have enough to go the whole length
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In a big American supermarket, some foodstuffs including a talking sausage, secretly come to life when no one can see them, and dream of being chosen and taken to the 'great beyond.' It seems like their time has come, but then they all get separated by accident, and learn of the true fate that awaits them when they're taken away.Seth Rogen spreads his brand of adult humour further with Sausage Party, expanding in to animated territory and turning the Disney/Pixar trend on its head with something apparently innocent looking that seriously isn't for kids. Its a subversive idea, that runs on the premise of being an animated film with loads of swearing and sexually explicit references, but it's a one joke premise that wears thin pretty quickly and doesn't really have the durability to sustain a feature length production, and would probably have worked better as a sketch.The whole film sees food products re-imagined in humanistic form, which makes for some subtle references to real life people, and dutifully leaves political correctness to the side lines. And so we have the Israeli/Palestinian conflict re-imagined as a bickering bagel and taco, a permanently drunk bottle of Mexican tequila, as well as a whole parading army of Nazi sauerkraut (that want to exterminate 'the juice.'). It certainly pushes the boundaries, but has no great plot to guide in, and so ends up being just a pile of occasionally funny set pieces, rounding off with a big, massive 'food orgy', for want of anything more fitting.Toy Story for adults, then. If only there was a bit of a 'Story', and one that had something more to it and helped keep you interested during the admittedly small length. **",4,9,22,21 September 2016
There Will Be Blood," Slow, lingering but brilliant dramatization of how money corrupts
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the 1890s, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) sees the profit to come from oil and becomes set on his journey to becoming a ruthless tycoon who will step over anything and anyone to get the bottom dollar. He manipulates a deeply religious family into selling him their land, most significantly the son Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) whose religious convictions are deeply held and without question. Over the years, Daniel continues to deny him and his family the money he owes them and drifts apart from his adopted son, whose deafness resulted from his greed and who he only uses to project a caring family man image, until he turns on him and Plainview descends into madness.The trick to succeeding in business, it's safe to say, is to market essentials, things people can't live without. Phillip Green has made millions from his Marks & Spencer clothes empire (aside from living on the continent for large parts of the week to avoid tax) and John Leslie picked himself back up from falling out the limelight by becoming a property developer. But nothing seems to bring in the bucks like oil, the substance needed to fuel the machines that get us around. After the war, Iraq stands to get itself right back up on it's feet due to the large oil reserves buried beneath it and think of all the Texan oil tycoons who've done well for themselves off the back of it. TWBB delves into the psyche of a trailblazing entrepreneur who first saw the potential to exploit this service for all it's worth and how determination and ruthless desire drive him to go right over the edge, even to murder.It's guided along, of course, by an amazing performance from Lewis, who captures the accent and spirit of Plainview perfectly. He has good support, too, from Dano as the young son of the preacher, driven by his beliefs and values who ends up selling out like everyone else. The film isn't driven by talky moments so much as long periods of silence and moodiness (including a dialogue free first thirty minutes) in which Paul Thomas Anderson, who writes and directs, creates an eerie and enthralling atmosphere of impending doom and madness. Every shot and every scene has it's own unique touch that creates just the right impression very subtly.It requires persistence and it might not strike you the first time, but there is no doubt this is a modern classic we have on our hands here, an enthralling and chilling tale of how money corrupts. *****",10,3,6,29 September 2008
Joker," Takes the Joker origin story, and puts a completely different slant on it
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGotham City, 1981. A place in the grip of a sanitation workers strike, leaving bags of waste piled high in the streets. A place where the divide between rich and poor is cutting through the hearts and minds of the people. In the midst of this madness, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggles to live. An introverted, eccentric character who struggles to survive in the world. He's on various different forms of medication, and has a condition which causes an involuntary, loud, hysteric laugh to emanate from his mouth. However, after a devastating encounter with a group of bullies on the subway, he is plunged into a shattering series of events where his existence will come to have more meaning than he could have imagined.When the Batman TV series originally aired in the 1960's, there were an entire cavalcade of villains who graced the screen on a weekly basis, but since the character's inception, none of them have ever had quite the hold on the cultural consciousness as the Joker. Easily the most intriguing, ambiguous, and startling neer do well, with a dark charisma that draws you in more. In this, what may be the most successful film of the year, director Todd Phillips reimagines the character's origins, and provides a totally different slant on them, diverting away from the comic-book narrative, and instead using the character as a template for a searing character study, serving as a wider examination of society as a whole.Just as the lead character is framed in a different spotlight, so are some other characters from his background in the DC comics universe. While Thomas Wayne (here portrayed with a dour, judgemental undertone by Brett Cullen) has been depicted before as a millionaire with a heart of gold, investing his fortune to helping those from a more disadvantaged background, here we see him as a selfish, heartless tycoon, who looks down on those less successful than him. This casts an iffier slant on the motivations of the man who kills him, and young Bruce, who goes on to become Batman. It is in this way that Phillips skilfully demonstrates that good and evil/right and wrong may not always be as straightforward as they seem, and circumstances can dictate things.Arthur is a marginalised, misunderstood loner, unable to form regular, normal relationships with others, who can only get that connection from others by serving as a freak show to an audience, thus his attempts to break through as a stand up comedian, and his determination to appear on The Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro, in another of these roles that don't naturally suit him, but which he tries his best) Show, which ends up serving as a shocking springboard for him to gain admiration spreading a populist message.Many might feel comic book characters have been done to death, but Phillips has here delivered something truly original and compelling, a thought provoking examination of nature or nurture that will turn everyone on their heads, and has established Phoenix as a bona fide, big name star.****",9,2,6,18 November 2019
Man on Fire," Dreary actioner
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsCreasy (Denzel Washington) is a former marine and recovering alcoholic who wearily agrees to take on an assignment arranged for him by his close pal Rayburn (Christopher Walken) to act as a bodyguard for a young girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City,where there is a kidnapping every 60 minutes and only 30% of the victims survive.Initially,he maintains a dismissive,strictly professional attitude around her but gradually lets her into his heart until he's rebuilding his life around her.So,when an unspeakable act is committed against her and her family,he sets out on a one man search-and-destroy mission against the perpetrators,leaving a bloody trail in his wake.There were a number of positive factors that attracted me to this film.One,Denzel Washington in the lead role.Two,I'd already seen and enjoyed the 1987,low-budget original starring Scott Glenn and was eager to see what a big budget Hollywood makeover would do for it.The fact that it was directed by Hollywood action-meister Tony Scott made it look good too.But,that's the thing.It's an action movie and it's a Tony Scott action movie.So where's the action?For the most part,this just drearily drones along,running well over it's time limit and resulting in an overlong plomb.Last year,the movie Bad Boys 2 ran for a similar time frame.I hope this isn't the start of a new trend from Hollywood of action movies with minimalist plots that run for roughly two and a half hours,'cos if it is,it's not very encouraging.But that is exactly what we have here:a minimalist plot.A very tired and creaky one of a strong-and-silent hero type who ends up forming a bond with a little kid.And when stretched to said time frame,it becomes one hell of an endurance tester.Somehow,you can hold your attention through to the end.But it can't be ignored that this is uninvolving,unengaging stuff.It's a shame.Spell-binding actor though Denzel is,he was in another action film that wasn't received very well some years ago by the name of Virtuosity.In a way,you can't help wondering why he didn't learn his lesson.**",Null,0,2,25 October 2004
Downfall," Quite a bit to take in in one go, but still an undeniably powerful and evocative movie
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A film detailing the last days in the life of Hitler (Bruno Ganz) in his bunker, as the Soviet army closes in and he madly clings on to his plans to retain domination.Before I saw it, Downfall was a small independent film I wasn't really that aware of, other than it had made it into number 9 in last year's top 10 list. But with this and some other high recommendations, when it was shown on Channel 4 last week it was recorded and I got round to giving it a go (having dismally forgotten to record the acclaimed Capturing the Friedmans the week before.) And I can definitely see why it got to where it did.I wasn't aware it was as long as it was going to be either, and I ended up watching it in two parts. And I was glad I did this for while the movie is expertly made and put together, all in one go it's a bit of a trek to sit through and, aside from being over-whelming, some of the scenes tend to become a bit repetitive, making the movie a little boring.Particular mention must go to Ganz in the lead role turning in a really good performance as Hitler, perfectly capturing the man, who could at turns be charming (especially in the company of women) practical and maniacal. There is a good supporting cast, but in the main role he is the best.Brilliant film that this is, it's better to be seen in two parts. It gets more engaging towards the end (not to mention more shocking!) But all in all a very well made depiction of a story that needed to be told and it's alarming that a piece of German cinema should have to top our charts when so much meaningless drivel gets made everywhere else. ****",9,2,5,7 March 2006
The Wolf of Wall Street," An electrifying central performance drives along a Scorsese masterpiece
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young man determined to get ahead and live the high life come what may, and so he travels to Wall Street, the financial epicenter of the world in the 1980's to make his mark. Treated like an underdog on his first day, he's lucky to have financier extrordinarie Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) spot his potential and take him under his wing, teaching him the key to success lies not in mere stocks and shares, but in selling investor's worthless or inaccurate pieces of paper that you've convinced them will net them loads. After losing his job in the Black Monday crash of 1987, he takes Hanna's advice and hooks up with former toy store worker and neighbour Donnie (Jonah Hill) and, after assembling a seemingly no hope bunch of co conspirators, they set up their own company and before long have reached the top and engage in a life of none stop debauchery, decadence and excessiveness beyond most people's wildest dreams, until FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) and his team start to dig in to whether Belfort's practices are legal.Eager as he is to convey yet another tale of a morally skewered individual and their inherent rise and fall, Martin Scorsese has nevertheless taken rather a gamble in these financially destructive times by bringing this real life tale of Jordan Belfort, the wheeler and dealer to end all wheeler and dealers, to the big screen. In an age where there are those struggling even to keep a roof over their heads, seeing someone who indulged in such mind blowing greed and extravagance may be a tough pill for many to swallow. But it's testament to his style and delivery that, while it can never really be said we come to like Belfort, something about his self belief and arrogant determination and indeed the have-everything world he creates makes him such an immorally appealing fellow that we never get to hate him either. If the richest people in the world really are just one per cent, and this is how they live, then it really isn't much of a mystery how everything is so unevenly divided.Now quite rightly regarded as one of the finest actors of our generation, in a career with many high points, this is the role in which DiCaprio will surely leave his highest cultural mark in the world of cinema. He injects a manic intensity and ferociousness to Belfort that at times is simply magnetic, mesmerizing as he thunders like a lion across the screen, as a man whose wild arrogance, immorality and desperate zest for life literally charge him like a battery. It's the finest role of his I've ever seen, and it's a shame it seems he's missed out on his Oscar for it, all I can say is whoever beat him must still be living their part now. But special mention must also be given to co star Hill, who I've only known for making well known comedies, but he seems to have taken DiCaprio's lead and attempted to be as full on and direct as him, to very nearly as great effect. As a double act, they set the screen on fire in a way you couldn't imagine. Also one not to forget is McConaughey, in what can only be about a ten minute role, who fills that brief time marvelously, espousing on to DiCaprio the self believing mantra that will transform him in to a God like figure in the boardroom, with a cult like audience in front of him.Scorsese seems wrapped up in the style of Goodfellas, with DiCaprio doing voice over for most of the film and sounding almost exactly like Ray Liotta from that film, and acting much like him too, both playing real life men who refused to be constrained by a life of mundanity and were willing to use illegal, immoral means to rise above it, climbing high but falling that much harder due to their own lack of self control and addiction to risk. He occasionally veers away and talking directly to the camera just for that extra dramatic impact.With the Black Monday crash of '87 being such a big event at the start of the film, it's a wonder no reference is made to Michael Douglas in Wall Street since that film came out that year. TWOWS is just a superb effort in it's own right, driven along by DiCaprio's best ever performance and a startling view of how the other half live that will blow your mind. *****",10,1,5,3 March 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Okay, but not as great as it could have been
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy) is a young doctor who travels out to Africa to help with the famine and poverty that is ravaging it in the 1970s. But he unexpectedly catches the eye of the current ruler, Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker) who takes him under his wing and, in return, asks him to be his personal psysician. At first Nicholas can see nothing wrong with the seemingly jolly and warm-hearted ruler, but like many rulers before him, Amin soon becomes corrupted by power and enforces a brutal and barbaric regeime. Trapped in a situation he can't get out of, Nicholas is left caught between a rock and a hard place.During the late 80s and early 90s, all Forest Whitaker could enjoy were comedy black guy roles in films like Bloodsport and Blown Away but who'd have thought that by 2007 he'd be the star attraction in grade A, Oscar contenders like The Last King of Scotland? Obviously driven by determination, he's worked his way up the Hollywood food chain during his career (something that may have been made harder by the colour of his skin) and is now in a position where he couldn't be happier with what he's got.He brings the lead role of the real-life Amin to life powerfully and with great conviction, chewing up any scenery he can get his hands on. Likewise, in the supporting role, McAvoy also can't be faulted.Sadly, though, for me the film wasn't as great as I'd have hoped. While it brings 70s Africa to life colourfully and gets as good performances as it could have hoped out the two lead stars, it wastes a good supporting cast, including Kerry Washington, Gillian Anderson, Simon McBurney and David Oyelowo and fails to form a really engaging solid narrative flow through-out. ***",7,1,3,26 September 2007
It Chapter Two," Imperfect but still admirable concluding part to the story
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWhen a series of child killings start again in the small town of Derry, Maine, Mike Hanlon, the one member of the 'Losers Club' who stayed behind, is forced to summon the other six back to defeat the monster they swore a blood oath to defeat. They have all gone and carved highly successful lives for themselves, but all make good on their promise to return, with the exception of Mike Hanlon, who commits suicide. Fuelled with a burning desire to honour his memory, they band together to defeat Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard), the evil clown, once and for all.When the remake of the original TV adaptation of Stephen King's epic novella was released two years ago, it was easy at first to anticipate it being another throwaway, cookie cutter remake of the sort getting churned out on a pretty regular basis these days, but lo and behold it went and became the most successful horror movie of all time. This was especially appreciated by viewers like me, to whom the original novel and TV film had a special impact on their early years. And so, this essential second part, from the same director Andy Muschetti, has rolled around, wrapping up his interpretation of Stephen King's original source material. At just under three hours, no one could accuse him of being anything less than thorough, and while it's quite flawed, it's still a fairly satisfying endeavour.Once again, Muschetti has gone all out and strove to include parts from the book that were absent from the TV series, including Adrian Mellon's brutal homophobic murder and the Ritual of Chud (although strangely the Bradley Gang slaughter is missing, odd since I'm sure I saw it featured in the trailer...editing floor), making it a more in depth and accurate account. But the best thing about it is....Pennywise. Or, more specifically, Bill Skarsgard's performance. He really comes into his own in the role here, bringing it alive and electrifying the screen with his presence. If his version of the role, and Tim Curry's from the TV film had been around at the same time, I would have struggled to differentiate which was more terrifying on the basis of this.Unfortunately, this is not enough to detract from the hammy, over the top delivery of the grown up Losers (a problem with the child stars in the 2017 film too!), an equally roughshod description of some of the important side characters (most notably Henry Bowers, whose pact with Pennywise to bring down the Losers is never properly hinted at!), an uneven balance between horror and humour and an overly excessive use of loud, harsh jump scares that get too much after a while.It scores more hits than misses, though, and is a more than satisfying closing chapter in this phenomenally successful 21st century reimagining (with even Stephen King himself making a self referential cameo.) ***",7,0,0,9 September 2019
American Gangster," This time Washington and Crowe set the screen (and the box office) alight
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The true story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), former driver for Harlem kingpin 'Bumpy' Johnson, who after the old man's death uses the things he learned from him over the years to start up his own heroin empire along with his friends and family. He eventually comes to control 1970s NYC with absolute power, until Det. Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) gets on his case. One honest cop in a department full of corrupt officers who are themselves embroiled in the drugs game, from selling it themselves to using it themselves.Twelve years ago, when Denzel was already a big star but Crowe was just a starting out Kiwi actor, they appeared together in Virtuosity, a sci-fi action film that tanked at the US box office and became one of the most high profile straight to video films ever in the UK. But all this while later, the acclaimed Ridley Scott has reunited them for this explosive real life gangster film with much more successful results. And, though they share virtually no screen time together, between them they keep the boat floating marvellously here.The star of the show, though, is Denzel. My favourite black actor, he reliably sets the screen alight here. He's delivered some of his best work when he does intense, power-house kind of roles, but as Lucas, he turns in a much more restrained performance, a cool, calm, calculating psychopath who shocks you by punching a man and then slamming the top of a piano into his head but somehow manages to be just as un-nerving knocking a cup of coffee across a room after describing how police officers tortured and killed his brother when he was younger. In the supporting role as the good guy, it has to be said, Crowe is less effective, not turning in a bad performance, just nothing to write home about, especially compared to Denzel. Still, the film does a great job of juxtaposing two men, on opposite sides of the law but also on different sides of morality, Denzel's character a man with a dishonest and evil trade but who never forgets his roots and looks after his family, Crowe's a good cop but an absent father and shameless skirt chaser.Scott has done a great job of bringing NYC to life as it (apparently) was in the early 70s, a grimy, unappealing sh!thole, a million miles away from the trendy, Central Perky look it has today. He allows his story to develop, and moves it along nicely with a neat list of supporting actors, as well as a cool, funky 70s soundtrack through-out.Everything pays off quite marvellously here. It's taken a while to arrive, but as the film year draws to a close, one of the best chugs along just in time. *****",10,1,3,8 December 2007
The Green Mile," Fairly well endowed to the book
","Before going to see The Green Mile tonight, it was only very recently that I had read the novel, and so I was able to know who the names of the characters were fairly quickly, and a lot of the story,for the extreme running time it occupied, became pretty easy to follow.But, if truth be told, I could have read the book 4 years ago when it was originally published, and still today be able to draw the same comparisons.The fact is, that if you read any novel which the film you are about to see is based on, you can make up your own interpretation of the story, and that is way better, because it happens at your own pace, and it unravels in your own way. So, out of the two, although the film was good, I would probably advise to read the book instead.The film picked a wise number when it chose to add light, humorous intervals to the story,e.g. Mr.Jingles first introduction, and all the other comic moments it inspired. A movie focusing on a story this grim and unrelenting would need moments like this to make it bearable, because when it is, it chills the blood with it's nastiness. John Coffey's wailing with the two dea d girls, and Eduard Delacroix's execution are profoundly nasty moments in the film. Another of the film's merits is the performances of it's stars. Tom Hanks seems to subconsciously mesmerise with his portrayal of the lead character. His bit as the regular honcho guy who has to place firm law and order on the inmates and his henchmen is affected by the smallest of things. His eye movement, his expressions, and his observations of the time and the place and indeed, the situation he is in truly lift the character he is playing up many notches. As for Michael Clarke Duncan as Coffey, well, in the next role I see him in, I'll be wishing he was in this one again. With one shot, he transforms a regular joe movie personality into a magnificent powerhouse of a performance, that powerfully renders all the cliches/stereotypes obsolete.Another asset of reading the book, however, is also that if you absorb it, if you take in everything that is happening, ,it will make the film go by far quicker. Although the novel is a far greater suggestion, really, The Green Mile is what proper moviemaking is all about.****",Null,1,1,1 May 2000
The Wrestler," Ticks all the right boxes and marks Rourke's comeback as a whole
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was a 1980s wrestling phenomenon, but years later he's a washed up has been who does the odd bit of wrestling here and there to a select crowd only. Estranged from Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) the daughter he was never there for, a sudden heart problem causes him to reassess his life and get back in touch with her, as well as try and get a relationship going with similarly past her prime stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei.) But when the opportunity for a major comeback match beckons, he's torn between the only thing he's ever been any good at and the personal life he's made such a mess of.Everyone over the age of eleven knows wrestling is staged and fake. Beefed up muscle men inflicting cartoonishly painful attacks and seeming torture on each other, as well as a lack of any genuinely competitive element or rules you can't break. Nevertheless, it has a world wide network of die-hard fans that annually pack out arenas and stadiums, making it a global enterprise in itself, so it's detractors have a large slice of humble pie to chew on. But, like many other 'sports', there is a definite chew them up and spit them out mentality to it, with stories of steroid abuse, backstage corruption and former champions going off the rails when they become past their prime. And in an almost semi autobiographical way, Mickey Rourke here perfectly brings to life a grizzled has been, whose isolated, pathetic existence is quite at odds with the high life he must have once enjoyed. You get the real feel of what it must feel like to have climbed so high and fallen so hard. Still, Randy's a fu*k up with a heart of gold you just can't help but love, a hard bitten, wise cracking tough guy whose spirit never manages to truly dampen in spite of relations in his personal life crashing down around him like Rome. The lack of a woman in his life is something he tries to resolve by starting to get something going with Cassidy (Tomei.) Although she's reluctant because dating a customer is a line she doesn't want to cross, she's in denial to the obvious attraction to Randy, in the sense they're both ageing has beens who can't cope with life without an audience, the one thing they both make a better job of than what's going on around them.'Acclaimed' director Darren Aronofsky has taken an unlikely subject matter and turned it into one of the most surprising and sensitive offerings of recent times. There's not much I can say that others already have, but this deservedly put Rourke back in the spotlight and wrongly failed to win any awards. *****",10,2,3,22 November 2009
Hancock," Okay in parts, but you get the idea Will Smith should be more careful of the scripts he's offered
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning John Hancock (Will Smith) is not your traditional superhero. He seems to have more trouble sorting out the sh!t in his own head than the sh!t on the streets, and is something of an alcoholic. When he causes yet another catastrophe, he is approached by PR guru Ray Emery (Jason Bateman) who invites him into the house he shares with his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and their young son. Ray wants to get Hancock to change his image and manners and try to improve the public perception of him, even convincing him to turn himself in and serve a little time in jail. But it all changes when he learns that Mary has the same superpowers as him and a new villain, Red (Eddie Marsan) is on the loose...Obviously intended as a humorous slant on all the superhero movies we were seeing last summer, Hancock further got Will Smith in people's faces after a string of movies as of late. But unfortunately, the lasting impression is that he should be more choosy about the script's he chooses...There's just nothing to Hancock. No depth, no substance, no...anything, really. It's just one of those scripts that you wonder why someone didn't look at it and think...this just doesn't work as a movie. The clever special effects, including a sequence where the two superheros battle with tornadoes tearing the streets of New York to pieces, certainly don't cover up the cracks in the weak script and a plot that just fails to have any sort of narrative flow at all. The Kingdom director Peter Berg's shaky camera doesn't help much either, and Hancock as a character is understandably flawed and depressed. Superheros are meant to be concealed characters, and certainly have more impressive powers than to just blast off up into the air and toss huge things up into the air. Rising star Marsan's villain hardly gets enough screen time to make much of an impression.It may not have been a massive flop, but it's certainly left a lasting impression about Smith for all the wrong reasons. **",4,0,2,26 January 2009
Kong: Skull Island," Flat, soulless addition to the Kong staple
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning It is 1973, the Vietnam war is coming to an end and a couple of scientists, headed by Dr. Bill Randa (John Goodman) persuade congress to fund a trip to a far off island to examine some environmental effects (or something.) They assemble a crack team of experts, including Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), and head off, but what they don't expect to encounter is an undiscovered tribe of natives, and an island inhabited by monsters, most notably, the massive, mighty Kong. Things get heated when men are killed and Colonel Packard turns hostile.It's pretty safe to say that Kong is one of the most enduring franchises in film history. Since his first outing in the early thirties, he has been re-adapted for the screen several times, with varying degrees of success, but it's probably retained a lot of its appeal by sticking to a period time frame, at least in the 2005 version I saw, while I'm not really sure about the lambasted 1976 version that I didn't. By never branching out into present day and keeping a nostalgic sense of times gone by to give it a distinctive touch. And so this new addition has rolled by, but in spite of some awesome special effects, it's a totally underwhelming spectacle compared to the ones that have gone before.Another device the previous instalments of Kong employed was to build up a great sense of mystery and awe before the great beast unveiled himself on the screen, creating a sense of foreboding and tension before he is seen, yet in Jordan Vogt-Roberts's flat imagining, he appears almost immediately upon arrival at Skull Island and it just gets more derivative from there. Not that you'll care about the fate of anyone, as an all star cast manage to portray a selection of the most bland, stalemate characters you could ever imagine, compered with an implausible non-entity of a plot.The effects are as awesome as ever, but this just doesn't have anything else going for it to justify such a lengthy running time. **",4,3,8,11 April 2017

But the nature of his occupation is secret, and it's only a matter of time before it becomes known. Plus, although Hitch is a hit at match-making with others, his own love-life is highly questionable.This is probably not the kind of film I'd usually give a go, but I remember when it premiered in my home city earlier in the year and Smith did a day long trek from Manchester to Birmingham and I went to the Birmingham premiere, purely for research purposes, I'm no Smith fanatic (unlike some of the girls there!), I just wanted to see what that kind of thing would be like in person. But this adverse publicity has finally rubbed off on me and I've given Hitch a go.As I said in my summary, for the kind of film it was it was very worthwhile and a refreshingly different sort of film for me. Smith has a natural presence and charm in the lead role and he is backed up by a very good supporting cast. It's an inspired concept, and the story, though a little incoherent, is funny and perfectly charming when it needs to be. It's basically all pulled off with aplomb and a very satisfying end product has been delivered.It's not a classic and it's not likely to leave a very long-lasting impression, but it's a nice film and a very pleasing way to spend a couple of hours. ***",7,0,0,23 September 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Great effects (as you would expect!) but still more Revenge of the sh!t than Revenge of the Sith
","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs The clone wars in the Galactic Empire wage on. General Grievous (voiced by Matthew Wood) and his army continue their stranglehold. When Anakin (Hayden Christensen) murders Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) it is the beginning of his descent into evil (or, the 'Dark Side', if you will) and his becoming of the evil Darth Vader. Chilling premonitions of wife Padme's (Natalie Portman) untimely death during child-birth force him to form an allegiance with the dubious Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and his former mentor and friend Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is the only one who can face-off with him as his descent grows more un-nerving.So this series obviously served as a prelude to the original films (I'm no massive Star Wars 'fanatic!') Be that as it may, this incomparable series to the original films is now over. Star Wars for a new generation with only half the quality (if that.) Like the best Summer blockbusters, the effects, computer graphics, battle scenes, creature designs etc. are really good, but not much else is. George Lucas, in all his SW films, has been a notoriously bad writer of dialogue, and this final entry is no exception. And it rubs off on the cast, from naturally wooden actors such as Christensen, to normally very reliable and capable performers such as McGregor and Samuel L Jackson who here appear very strained, stiff and unable to perform convincingly. Only McDiarmid, in the bad guy role, manages to pull off a convincing turn in the sea of dross that is the script.The one engaging element of the whole film is the theme of choosing good and not being lured into the trap of evil. But mostly, this can only be seen as the final part of what is a very average re-run of a series that was far better and provoked far more inspiration first time round. **",4,3,6,22 June 2005
Ray," Very well made drama and another deserved Oscar contender
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs A drama exploring the life and times of legendary blues singer Ray Charles (Jamie Foxx.)Born into a poor single-parent family in Central Florida at the start of the 1930s,the film begins by charting the beginning of his tumultuous life going blind at age 7,through to overcoming Jim Crow racism to become a respected black performer and entertainer in America,as well as depicting his seedier side with his womanizing ways and over-coming a nasty heroin addiction.It says a lot about me that I had absolutely no idea who Ray Charles was until I heard he'd died last year.But then,he was well before my time.And,as usual,it seems that we only just find out how much of a legend someone is when they have died,and thus abiding by the old aidage of 'ya-don't-know-what-you've-got-'till-it's-gone.'But judging by this fantastic biopic,it certainly seems the man lived quite an extraordinary life,and,in turn,his life story makes for extraordinary viewing.I'd be happy if Foxx did win the Best Actor Oscar tonight,because he certainly delivers a great lead performance as Charles.He spent a lot of time with the great man before he died,and it's payed off,much more successfully,it has to be said,than Will Smith's collaborations with Muhammad Ali with his performance as the said boxing man.He's amerced himself in the role,capturing Charles's every mannerism and,to be honest,moreorless becoming him!It's an effective piece of method acting,indeed.Robert De Niro would be proud.He's complimented well by a superb supporting cast as well,especially the one who played his mother.You can't help but notice,from the off-set,the films TV movie kind of feel.It moves along in a jovial kind of way too,and some may argue this detracts from the serious feel the movie should have been aiming for,but,if anything,it succeeds in not alienating it's audience so much and making the experience a more merry and,in turn,enjoyable one.Some might argue that,despite the film's considerable length (152 mins!) it only centres on the early parts of Charles's life and just sort of brushes over the last parts in little segments,but then you have to think that around this time he got older and therefore became part of an older generation and perhaps wasn't in the public conscious quite so much.And it does include the most important bits of this.All-in-all,this can only be described as quite a well made and very engaging biopic of a man who lead a very interesting life and will be remembered by those who can remember him most probably for the rest of their lives.It hits all the right notes,if you'll forgive the pun.I wish it all the best tonight.****",Null,2,4,27 February 2005
Shooter," A straight to video action film that found it's way onto the big screen
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Whalberg) was a soldier who's best friend was killed on a mission that went wrong. Since then he's been in seclusion up in the hills- until he's approached by a government agent (Danny Glover) with a proposition- stage a hit on a US senator. With his expert knowledge and professionalism, Swagger agrees- only to find himself set up for a real assassination attempt and in a desperate race for his life.With the first three films of his that I've seen, Antoine Fuqua has proved he can deliver on all levels of quality, from excellent (Training Day), to average (Tears of the Sun) and then downright awful (King Arthur.) With this rather precise decline in quality from film to film, I really had to sit and wonder just what kind of film Shooter would turn out to be. The answer: average again.I know he'd made a few films before it, most notably 1998's The Replacement Killers with Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino, but TD was the film that really pushed Fuqua into the big time with Denzel's Oscar win. What happened to that film's raw, dynamic intensity and tense, powerful atmosphere? Why was it just not present in the next few films he made? This is a total pot-boiler of an action film, with every cliché in the book trotted out in rapid succession and a mumbling Whalberg as our action hero, along with a supporting cast including Glover, Elias Koteas and Ned Beatty who don't seem too excited either. The film has a very cheap look to it for a film that went to theatres, with some iffy looking CGI and fake model helicopters, as well as a total lack of any exciting action. It's defenders might say it has an intelligent, twisty-turny, Bourne-esquire plot that you have to pay attention to, but I paid for action and Shooter had it's sight crooked.It's better than KA, but this is still a bland, uninspiring effort all the way, one to nod off to when you need to get an early night. A damp squib from a director who started with such power. **",4,6,13,3 November 2007
The Lion King," An animation masterpiece and a more enduring modern story from the Disney staple
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Simba is a young lion cub, born to his father Mustafa, the ruler of Pride Rock. This means he will grow up to ascend the throne after Mustafa, to the envy of his evil uncle Scar, who forms an alliance with the hyenas of the barrens, personally killing Mustafa and arranging to have them kill Simba, who disappears into the wilderness. Years later, he re-emerges to claim his rightful place and take down the evil Scar.It's a scary thing when you start to notice you're getting older, when films you remember seeing when they first came out are re-released for a new generation, especially when you remember seeing them when you were so young. What with the recent re-release of Jurassic Park and now this 3D re release of one of Disney's more original works, not adapted from any old fairy tales or children's stories. But, with the onslaught of admittedly amazing Pixar wonders that tend to do the rounds more nowadays, The Lion King is a timely reminder of just how well Disney can do when left to it's own devices.While you often get infinitely more cynical as an adult, the timeless wonders of Disney animations are an opportunity to re-connect with your inner child and appreciate something that works on a more superficial appeal than what is required to appreciate more gritty, hard hitting adult stuff. That said, as well as having fluffy kids appeal (most notably with the I Just Can't Wait to be King and Hakuna Matada musical interludes) TLK also plays out with themes of a more traditional Greek tragedy, of jealousy, murder and revenge that gives it an under lyingly more darker tone...I do remember parents being advised to watch with younger children on the back of the video I used to own and maybe it's not that hard to see why.It's hard to recall a really bad Disney animation, and The Lion King is not only no exception, it's a prime example of why they hold such timeless appeal for child and adult alike, an animation masterpiece that will always hold an appeal to anyone who sees it (and even more so if you first saw it when you were young.) *****",Null,2,3,19 October 2011
Inception," A lot to take in...definitely one you'll need to see more than once
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning It seems dreams are more than just something in the mind, rather they're an alternative form of reality where the boundaries of time and space can be expanded far beyond that of the 'real world.' With this new knowledge to everyone's mind, Agent Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio) exists as a specialist in extracting information from people's dreams- but now he's been presented with a new challenge- implanting an original thought in a subject's mind to shift a balance of power in the real world. With the help of gifted student Ariadne (Ellen Page) and a team of reliable specialists, he sets about his task...but as he does, he's forced to confront a dreadful aspect of his own past that refuses to lie dormant and threatens to rise up and exact a vengeance of it's own.That, at least, after two viewings, is as best I can make out the plot to Inception. It seems to have topped most other people's 'greatest films ever made' lists, but it has the accolade from me of being the only film since...I don't know when, that I've had to pay to see twice at the cinema. The sheer intelligence and complexity of the plot seems to have wowed everyone, even if the most academic amongst us would struggle to call it anything less than deeply confusing and far fetched. The problem I found was there was so much to take in, you ended up paying so much attention to it all than actually enjoying very much. That's why, rather than hailing it as the greatest thing since sliced bread like everyone else, I prefer Christopher Nolan on more straight-forward, delivering ground like The Dark Knight and Insomnia. He seems like he's on some mad mission to blow everyone away with this one, making a lengthy, brain numbing assault on the senses that refuses to know it's limitations. There's actually staggeringly little 'cool'about the film, except among elitist film snobs and Mensa specialists. It is, undeniably, a brilliant film...but maybe it's just so brilliant in it's own way, that it fails to be entertaining in any other way.In the lead role, Di Caprio further cements his 'Hollywood royalty' staple, with some now hailing him as the new De Niro. He has a lively supporting cast (with much less to do!) in the shape of Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bronson star Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwaite, Michael Caine and Lukas Haas. Obviously a script with enough in it to entice a lot of top talent.One of the most mind blowing films you will ever see, Inception is certainly not something you can switch your brain off to, but if you're up for using your noggin, this could reveal a lot about you. ****",9,1,9,7 September 2010
Lord of War," Probably one of the most satisfying films you'll see in ages
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A film charting the rise and fall of Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) an arms dealer, from his early days in the early 1980s in Little Odessa selling weapons to local mobsters through to his ascension through the decade of excess and indulgence to selling guns on a global scale. The film also charts his relationship through the years with younger brother Vitaly (Jared Leto), his marriage to perfume model Ava (Bridget Moynahan), his pursuit by determined but moralistic federal agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) and his business transactions with a powerful African warlord (Eeamon Walker) and his psychotic son (Sammi Rotibi) that finally make him start to really question the morality of his work.Cage is the lead star of this film, and as so is ultimately the driving force behind it. And that's great, because it's hard to imagine anyone but him in the lead role. His snazzy, edgy, downbeatenly charismatic persona fuels the film perfectly. It's even better that his character is such an interesting and thought-provoking one. The film paints an earnest examination of him, a man sub-consciously aware through-out of the wrongfulness of what he does, but also always on hand with a quick-fire justification of it. Whether or not these are really genuine or just him trying to cover up for the high-flying, money driven guy he is only the viewer can decide but this is what will make the film so engaging to some. It's also interesting how the film doesn't simply zoom in on him in a current storyline, but charts his rise from nothing up to when he was really somebody then to crashing down again in the years from 1982-2001. The 80s was, of course, the decade of excess, greed and indulgence where everybody wanted to be a success and wanted to have lots of money and material wealth, so in many ways as a character study it's very similar to Al Pacino in Scarface, as both are men who come from nothing but, in that decade, dream of the wealth and success that everyone else seems to have and are prepared to do anything to get it themselves, even by breaking the law.Cage may be the man running the show, but everyone in the supporting cast is also flawless. Moynahan is fine as the kindly wife receiving the sudden shock to the system of what her husband really does, as is Leto as Cage's weary, coke-addled little brother (maybe even his best role ever!) Walker and Rotibi as the father/son psychotic African tyrants also played their roles well (amazing, since there seems to be so little of a real age gap between them) but really the best out of all of them is Hawke, who has a very well-written/conceived role as the federal agent determined to stick by his morals even when the best option would really seem to be to step over them.In seven years of directing, this is actually the first film from director Andrew Niccol I've actually seen. Maybe I need a bit of time to get used to his style but this has certainly been one of the best films I've seen all year, a great character examination and a definite, eccentric Cage movie. *****",10,2,5,28 October 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Dull, over-bearing update of classic literary series
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) finally catches the elusive Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), who's been responsible for a series of murders and occult black magic use in 19th century England, and sees him, or apparently sees him executed. But when it appears the super-villain has mysteriously risen from the grave, Holmes and his nagging but ever loyal sidekick Dr. Watson (Jude Law) must use all their detective know how and skill to solve the mystery while dodging obstruction from every corner of London society.A big screen adaptation for 21st century audiences of Arthur Conon Doyle's legendary literary detective was an unusual change of direction for southern hot shot Guy Ritchie to take on, but he's gone at it with his usual gusto, leaving no stone unturned and striving for the most professional job he can get. Unfortunately, his SH is a bewildering mess, a long, heavy, humourless affair that is curiously short on entertainment value.Much of the dialogue is probably true to the style Doyle originally used in his novels, but it is nonetheless baffling and over-whelming even to someone like me who isn't much of a lover for slang. It manages to be a lot of style with no real substance, and for a 'blockbuster' doesn't give you a lot to be on the edge of your seat about. Performances wise, Downey Jr. tries to get under the skin of the lead character, but doesn't stand out and does a questionable cockney accent, while Law is as bland and unremarkable as ever as the sidekick. Even support like Eddie Marsan and Kelly Reilly can't do anything. Strong is good as the villain, practically playing the role in his sleep, and things do perk up a bit at the end. Overall, though, Ritchie should stick to gangster films. **",4,12,19,14 September 2010
WALL·E," Another Disney/Pixar effort that won't be thrown to the dogs anytime soon
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Many years from now, Earth has become a desolate wasteland, teeming with junk on piles of scrapheaps. In amongst all this, WALL-E (a Waste Allocation...thingee) roams around, pressing bits of junk into boxes. He has to encounter the occasional earth-storm and, after the latest, runs into EVE-A, a female robot who he forms a crush on (wonder how they'll go about having kids?!? Twisted or what???) and gets taken away with after the latest storm. But as well as falling in love, WALL-E's also going to learn the sinister truth about why the earth's in the state it's in now, leading to a magical adventure to the end.As a work of animation and movement, WALL-E is, of course, as spectacular an achievement as any of the other Disney/Pixar works from their now rather extensive back catalogue. But one thing sets it apart from most of the others: the largely dialogue free nature of it all, with most of the picture filmed in total silence, with WALL-E just peddling around, doing what he does and what he gets himself into. Indeed, as I sat in the cinema and watched it, one thought couldn't stop running through my mind: I have got to see There Will Be Blood pretty soon (noted for the dialogue free first thirty minutes, I think!!!) This different approach is a bit of a gamble for the film-makers, as not only will the lack of speech and intonation be confusing for the still largely child audience but may also put off some of the older members, looking forward to some of the sparkling, witty writing from The Incredibles and Toy Story. Yet in spite of this, WALL-E, simply as a work of animation and wonder, does manage to work and not malfunction like a bust robot.The adult angle (which D/P are renowned for working wonders with) here is less with the dialogue and humour and instead using any intelligence and subtlety on display to make a clever comment on the way the earth is headed if mankind does not change it's attitude to the environment and protecting our planet, as well as how the greedy consumerist society will turn everyone into disgustingly lazy, fat slobs, too used to ordering everything and receiving everything from pressing buttons and clicking on keyboards without getting up and moving to do things for themselves. While the animation and effects are bedazzling everyone, kids and some of the more sensitive members of the audience can derive some 'aaah's from the titular character himself, the cutest robot since Johnny 5 from Short Circuit.Some might say it's just for kids, but they'd be total Wall-ies. ****",9,0,2,30 August 2008
The Good Shepherd," Intelligent and well made but the overly heavy feel will leave many alienated
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Robert De Niro's lengthy second directorial outing was the subject of mixed reviews when it first came out that made it a hit or miss affair in cinemas. While it was hailed as a decent and admirable piece of film-making, it's length and heavy subject matter marked it as one that might not go down well with certain other members of the film-going population. And on this rare occasion, the critics mostly seem to have got it right.It's one I left, or wanted to leave, until it came on TV on New Year's Day, but even then the length put me off (what with all the other Christmas TV I'd been taking in!) But I decided to rent it instead, and finally put some time aside to take it all in. This is De Niro's take on how the CIA was formed, by a group of young men belonging to a secret order/society just before the second world war broke out, who came to be headed by Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) an idealistic, patriotic American who's been striving for truth and justice since his father committed suicide as a young man. We follow his journey as his loyalty is tested as the war starts, being asked to gather evidence against his mentor Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon) who's suspected of being a Nazi sympathiser, onto years later when the Bay of Pigs Invasion breaks out in Cuba and a mysterious sex tape appears to be the exposure of a traitor selling American intelligence to the Cubans, through to Wilson's personal life living a double life with a sweet deaf girl he met in a library, and the fiery Margeret (Angelina Jolie) with whom he's forced into marriage after getting her pregnant. But will his son come to be the straw that broke the camel's back? That's the plot description and as you can see, it's a lot to take in and I'm not sure I pieced it all together right. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent person who can handle strong, challenging stuff like this, but I'm also a young person with, suitably, the attention span of a knat and yes, I must admit at times I did find TGS a trifle over-whelming and hard to follow. We need as much intelligent cinema as we can get at the moment, what with our culture being dumbed down to the point of collapse, so the film is actually quite refreshing, if nothing else. Sadly, it also smacks of being somewhat over-ambitious, with a distinct lack of humour and light through-out (bar seeing Damon in drag singing 'Poor Little Butter Cup', funniest drag queen since Gary Busey in Under Siege!) that only serves to make it an even more alienating experience. It's a mature film, and will probably be appreciated more by a seasoned crowd. The new generation of cinema goers are getting stupider, but this may not have done as well as it should more because of how inaccessible it might have felt to a lot of people more than the other reason.The performances are pretty faultless, Damon a revelation as the self contained, humourless Wilson and Jolie showing some of that Changeling greatness as his strong willed wife. Being that it's his film, De Niro gives himself a small role with very limited screen time, ditto the likes of Alec Baldwin, William Hurt and Gambon, whilst fine, accomplished actors like Timothy Hutton and Joe Pesci get virtual cameos in even more secondary roles.Overall, this is compelling, challenging, inspired, intelligent, original cinema, a perfect retrospective piece from De Niro in the autumn of his life and career, that sadly has a lack of appeal to the target demographic of cinema goers, for whom it would probably come off as too heavy, humourless and ambitious. One that might be better on a second viewing, me thinks. ***",7,1,3,1 February 2010
The Terminal," Unbelievable and uninteresting tale of bureacracy gone mad

The Shawshank Redemption," One of the greatest films ever made!!!
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn 1947,banking boss Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover and given two life sentences in the notorious Shawshank State Prison.Keeping himself to himself and giving off a slightly aloof vibe,Andy finds it hard to settle in at first,but then he develops a friendship with prison fixer Red (Morgan Freeman) which comes to stand the test of time between life within the confines of Shawshank...and even outside it.Stephen King adaptations are things that generally seem to have trouble even becoming watchable things on the big screen,let alone spell-bindingly brilliant pieces of work.So,it is credit to director Frank Darabont,who would later go on to helm another SK adaptation,the only slightly inferior Green Mile,that he has managed to do just that.Of all the Stephen King books and short stories that I've read,I've never actually come across Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,yet I was still able to appreciate this films on all the levels it deserves to be appreciated on.Everything just comes together and works like magic.On the performances front,as the narrator and co-star,Freeman adds solid,engaging and memorable support,but it has to be said he's been in better roles and,for all he's worth,he's outshone in the leading role by Robbins,who rightfully earned the Oscar nomination,and was only cheated in not getting it.He delivers a powerful,intensely focused portrayal of a man who appears in complete acceptance of all the events that have transpired around him and is fighting his own personal demons to adapt to the changes that are happening all around him.I don't think I can remember him delivering a more entertaining performance in any other film I've seen him in.Other great support comes from Bob Gunton as the bible-preaching yet corrupt warden and Clancy Brown as his sadistic right hand man/guard,but,in fairness to them all,they all take a back seat to Robbins.Despite it's grim themes,the film somehow also manages to be a beautiful one of hope.'Get busy living...or get busy dying' says Andy,high-lighting how from the direst of situations,what one makes of it can ultimately deaden despair and bring...well,hope.The topic of how incarceration can bring about institutionalization is also brought up,and how,for those serving life sentences,the ultimate punishment,having spent most of their life in jail,is to be freed at all,to a world that will have passed them by and an age they will struggle to come to terms with.'When they send you to Shawshank State Prison,that's exactly what they take...your life',another line from the film that captures perfectly what it's trying to say.Some would appear detracted that the film has a presentation that is more fitting to a TV movie than a major Hollywood production.But considering it could be put in the same league as all the effects-reliant blockbusters,the further the film could do to distance itself from those kinds of film,in my opinion,the better.In it's tenth anniversary year,this is a film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.Considering all the rubbish that gets released nowadays,it's good and refreshing to know that as comparatively recently as ten years ago,it was still possible to see quality stuff like this emerge out the woodwork every so often.I consider it to be one of the greatest films ever made (thoroughly deserving of it's position at No.3 on the IMDb Top 100 list!) and easily on a par only with Stand By Me as the greatest King novel to make it to the big screen.It truly is a film of majestic quality and brilliance.*****",Null,1,5,16 November 2004
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Smart, sassy, subversive film-making, shot in a style that will take some getting used to
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) was famous, many years ago, for appearing as the comic book hero Birdman on the big screen, but is now trying to rehearse a Broadway play that is premiering in a few nights, only for one of the key actors in the play to fall ill during production. Replacing him is loose cannon actor Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), whose reckless style endangers the production and forces Riggan in to a self imposed mental deterioration, where he's forced to put all the things wrong in his life, including his fractured relationship with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone), into perspective. All the while, his former superhero alter ego mentally tears at him and tries to live through him again.Given the onslaught of superhero movies we've found ourselves hit with in recent times, if nothing else Birdman turns the genre on it's head, presenting a hero served purely for the purposes of a unique story and not derived from any Marvel franchise. It's a completely surreal, off the wall and daring concept, that many might not warm to the first time. But it's undeniably the product of an intelligent, outside the box sort of mind, that also manages some sharp stabs at social satire, with pop culture references thrown in, by the way of mentioning hot, trendy young actors (including Jeremy Renner) who are very much at the forefront right now.As if the concept wasn't high end in and of itself, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu also attempts a unique filming style, shooting events from Riggan's exit from the stage in a continuous loop, following him from every encounter there on. This is a different style, and requires you to stick with it more than the traditional style of cutting to the next scene, but on the other hand also adds an air of realism you probably wouldn't have otherwise got. If you can just stick with it and warm to it, the film might do more for you. Keaton is well suited in the lead role, in a role rather semi-autobiographical at this stage of his career, given his notability of playing Batman in the 80s. In far lesser supporting roles, Norton also injects the energy only he can to his role, as does Zack Galifianakis as his agent. Accompanying it all throughout is a bouncy drum and bass soundtrack that keeps it all flowing.The concept has worn out a little the end, and becomes a little tiresome, and could have done with maybe wrapping up a little earlier than it does, but it's taken you on such a unique and surprising ride to that point, that you can't really complain. ****",9,0,3,18 August 2015

But rather than end up long forgotten, Halloween went on to become and has remained a firm cult favourite in the field of the horror genre.Put simply, Michael Myers is the scariest horror movie character ever. And all the more scarier because he's only human. No evil, supernatural powers, just a human monster without the slightest tinge of pity or mercy, who kills for seemingly no reason other than it's just something he wants to do. He doesn't even spare his victims a witty Freddy Krueger style one-liner or Pinhead style explanation, just stares at them coldly with that creepy mask of his and kills them ,no matter how much they struggle and beg.The creepy score ('...duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh deh- duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh deh...') remains a high-point. Inevitably, though, the constraints at the time the film was made haven't lasted through. It was a low budget horror film made in the late 70s and as such, some things like the lighting, sound and production values sadly do look rather corny now.On the performances front, Pleasance is a commanding lead, giving the role his all as a man who can't mess around. Curtis had a stroke of luck that she was remembered and went on to have quite a memorable career. The acting from all the supporting cast (i.e the horny teenagers) isn't up to much but then it didn't have to be, just act pretty obnoxious and wait to be slaughtered...A film that's left an unswavering mark on the horror genre, sadly tarnished by all the awful sequels that became increasingly more sub-standard the more they went on, Halloween is a small film that's left a big legacy. *****",10,0,2,4 October 2007
The Water Diviner," A bit of a slow pace at times, but generally a well made and affecting war drama
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1915, after the end of the Battle of Galipoli, World War One is drawing to a close. Connor (Russell Crowe), a simple farmer who lives in the out backs of Victoria, Australia, is missing two sons who went off to fight in the war. Following his wife's suicide, he travels to Turkey to begin the search for his missing boys, and finds lodgings with the beautiful Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) and her son. He also finds himself scouring the fields with Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), the army commander who lead the army Connor's sons were fighting against, who's now trying to build diplomatic relations with the opposing forces. As he draws nearer to the truth, Connor must brace himself for a devastating reality.In the year the world observed the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, Russell Crowe picked a timely moment to unveil his directing debut to the world. He'd spoken about it for many years, and there'd been hints it would be coming here and there, but finally this drama set against the backdrop of the war is finally here. Rather than set it on the battlefront, Crowe has chosen to highlight the raw human drama that unfolded behind the scenes and was comparatively ignored, that of all the soldiers in the various regiments, companies and divisions who were unaccounted for and in many cases, never found.It seems to incorporate many tones as it goes along, mixing together a lot of haunting atmosphere, light humour, raw human drama and historical narrative pretty much all at the same time. While all of this is very affecting, a lot of the time the pace is a little too slow and has a bit too much of a Sunday afternoon vibe to it, creating a bit of a dull feel. A shame, since the themes it's exploring couldn't be any less toned down, including heartbreak, forgiveness, redemption and hope. It beats with the heart of a lion, but flows with the blood of a sheep, a film with solid themes but the execution of a telly drama, but which still manages to stir and engage.If you only get one chance to make a first impression, Crowe has demonstrated a generally firm and adept approach to film-making, with a stirring story and tonnes of ambition, but one which maybe just needs to move with a little more fire and flare in it's heart. ***",7,3,8,8 August 2015
Wonder Woman," A woeful, overly labourious attempt to balance the gender gap with the superheroes
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Diana (Gal Gadot) was raised on a distant planet of only women, where her mother wanted to protect her from the physical demands of fighting like all the other women there. But one day she starts to rebel and unleashes some hidden powers she was unaware of, meaning the rite of passage has come, so her mother tells her the story of a spiteful son of a God and his attempt to destroy the Earth. Then, Air Force pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands into their home, confusing the order of things. He reveals he has a book that contains plans by evil German commandant Ludendorff (Danny Huston) to unleash a deadly nerve gas on England. And so Diana and Steve must head to London to thwart his diabolical plan.The superhero franchise, on both sides of the DC/Marvel divide, must really be doing the rounds, as now we have Wonder Woman, who was a character in the recent disastrous Batman Vs. Superman movie, in her own more than feature length film. And after this, there is of course the Justice League film, where all the main players are having a big jamboree together. Whether this was the inspiration behind this films existence or pressure from the feminist movement to get some good ol' equality up there on the big screen is unclear, but either way the debut feature length directorial effort of Patty Jenkins is a long, joyless effort that wastes a golden chance to level the playing field for female superheroes.Like Batman, even more so, in fact, Wonder Woman has been taken from a pretty camp, light hearted source, and been transformed into something far moodier and deep on the big screen, where undemanding fun has been substituted for wondrous spectacle. But for all the awe inspiring effects and breath taking action sequences, it can't make up for a total sense of humour failure in the script, as well as any care-worthy characters or snappy dialogue, as well as a totally sloppy, incoherent plot that really fails to suck you in for the length it does. She may be beautiful and glamorous to look at, but Gadot isn't the greatest actress, to say the least, and co star Pine is equally vapid and bland. Even a support cast including David Thewlis, Ewen Bremner and Lucy Davis can't help. Performances wise, the best thing is Huston as the villain, who really fits the skin of his character, but can't make the whole thing taste any better.It would have been great to see a good Wonder Woman, but sadly this is just Blunder Woman! *",2,58,124,22 June 2017
The Queen," A well conceived and well made film with brilliant performances all round
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 1997. A year that saw the face of England change forever. A new Labour government was sworn into power, promising radical new ideas and reforms after many years of oppressive tory rule and, during the summer, a terrible tragedy struck when Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in a Paris tunnel after being hounded mercilessly by paparazzi. But what was life like for the Royal Family during this tumultuous period? With the public in a united state of grief over the terrible tragedy and needing to take it out on someone in the shape of the Royals, who appeared cold and indifferent to Diana's passing, this film follows the royals as they struggle to cope with mounting pressure from their public to do away with ancient royal traditions and customs to show respect to a woman who was loved by so many.With it being just under ten years now since Diana's death, and with a lot of the focus still being on the woman herself and how she was hard done over by all those who were meant to care the most about her, it's certainly a very interesting idea to show it from the perspective of the royals themselves (life did go on for them after all) and how the unfolding events came to affect them and the tidal wave of hysteria they were caught up in. It's good as well that it's been pulled off so well. The film slips in a few interesting facts about the queen (that you might not have known) along the way whilst telling a story detailing the reasons she was turned against by the public along with the rest of her family during that unforgettable summer when the nation united in grief. A good story is unlikely to be pulled along without strong performances to back it up and that is the case here. In the lead role, the renowned Helen Mirren is sturdy and dynamic as the commanding monarch, and she is of course guided along smoothly by a strong supporting cast, including Michael Sheen as the new prime minister, (the American) James Cromwell as the uptight and pompous Prince Philip, Sylvia Sims as the neglected Queen Mother and Alex Jennings as the beleaguered, mourning Prince Charles. They are difficult roles to pull off (and not ones you can entirely keep a straight face to) but under the circumstances they all do splendidly.Quite simply, this is a very commendable and inspiring film telling events from an angle they weren't seen from that is well worth seeing. ****",9,2,4,1 November 2006
1408," There have been far worse King adaptations, for sure, but still a bit over-rated
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a cynical writer who tries to debunk popular ghost stories and myths with his novels. But he has one more to crack- a room in an old New York hotel called 1408, which has been plagued with stories of murder, suicide and creepy happenings. The hotel owner Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) desperately tries to convince him not to go ahead with it, but Mike won't be satisfied until he's tried it for himself. To begin with, it all seems like he suspected, a big hoax, but then creepy happenings do begin, and he's confronted with events from his own past that drive him to the brink of insanity.Stephen King sets a lot of his books in his home town of Bangor, Maine. Other fans of his work may not have noticed this, but I've always felt that this setting has added to the sense of creepiness and tension of his stories. But what's this??? New York??? Somehow, a hotel room in the Big Apple hasn't got quite the same impact as somewhere as enclosed as Maine. It's a great place to set a horror story. I myself have always felt a weird sense of tension if I stay alone overnight in an old hotel room in somewhere like Cornwall for some reason, but setting is everything and New York, well...Cusack has received a lot of praise for his performance in the lead role, and he does try his best, even if his constantly being distracted by The Carpenters's We've Only Just Begun comically reminded me of Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. Other scenes that were meant to add to the scare factor, like his hand getting hit by a closing window and a tap bursting in his face, also lead to some unintentional amusement. Jackson is his usual steely, stern self in the supporting role and the rest of the supporting cast are also pretty good.The first short story to be adapted from King's Everything's Eventual novel, this has a lot of good ideas floating around in it as well as some strong performances and a few neat scare scenes. But the story feels awfully disjointed and without a solid, firm foundation to hold your interest through-out and King's robbed it of his familiar, neat sense of claustrophobia by switching settings to somewhere so wide, colourful and populated. There are far, far worse adaptations of his work out there, of course, but of the few that get praise anything above pretty good, personally I didn't think this was one of them. ***",7,1,2,6 September 2007
The Iron Giant," An enourmously surprising kid's movie
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThis was a kid's film,and,as such,I probably would have forgone it,had I not planned to watch it with my younger cousin,who,for reasons out of my control,was unable to make it.I guess I could watch Bicentennial Man with him next weekend,given it's release date is this week.But,granted I'd already spent £2.50 on the rental fee,I might as well at least get my money's worth and watch it.The film earned a lot of good reviews,and,on this occasion,I'm not really surprised.This is an intelligently done family movie,combining some of the darker overtures of Animal Farm ,with the standard pacing of your regular kid's film.I've probably seen better,more up-to-date style animation elsewhere,but the devil really lies in the details with The Iron Giant.The giant robot itself is the best animated movie droid I have ever seen,and the script skillfully lets it spout a different range of emotions each from us:humour,pity and understanding.The young Hogarth is slightly repetitive,but he has some great other characters to play with,like the excruciatingly snoopy FBI agent,and the individual beatnik,though the mother character is slightly underused. The Iron Giant manages to do both it's aims extremely well: be an entertaining kids film,and be an intelligent piece of post cold war propaganda,almost on a par with The Day The Earth Stood Still.It's this film with more humour,and more social observation.The robot definitely steals the show,though:the effects,it's unintentionally misfiring attempts to mimic Hogarth,and it's sad ending all contribute greatly to making The Iron Giant the splendid film it is.Highly recommended.****",Null,0,1,2 July 2000
Taken 2," As meaningless and apathetic as I found the first film
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningEx CIA operative Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) invites his estranged, at odds family to fly over to Istanbul with him as he takes on a private security mission there. However, he hadn't counted on the relatives of all the men he killed in the first film launching their retaliation on him, going for his family along with him. Once again, Mills must use all the skills he's acquired to protect himself and those he loves.Maybe it's just me, but I've noticed a bit of a slump in really interesting looking films coming out lately, which may explain why I added this sequel to a film I thought was quite over rated in the first place to my rental list. But, as much as people loved the first film, so they were quite disappointed with this sequel, in fact most downright hating it. My only reaction was to find it as piecemeal as the first film, with Neeson going through the motions again, doing pretty much what he did in the first film again, while the action is filmed at too close up a range, with an unrealistic looking Istanbul as the location. Rade Serbedzija's villain is probably the best thing in it, though with limited screen time. Then again, it's very short and sweet, which makes it inoffensive enough not to be a total stinker. **",4,0,0,30 April 2013
Straight Outta Compton," In depth, lengthy, but lacking a solid narrative structure to hold it together
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the late 80s, a group of young black men, including Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Junior, in his debut role), Dr Dre (Corey Hawkins), Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell) and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Junior) emerge from the streets of Compton, South Central Los Angeles, to form the NWA, a hard core rap band who, in sharp contrast to the laid back, affable lyrics of time gone by, blast out sharp rhymes about police harassment/brutality, gang killings and drug slinging that get right in everyone's face, and even gain attention from the FBI. The content of their songs sees them struggle to get airplay, but Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti), a mainstream record producer, sees their potential and signs them up. But over the course of time, internal conflicts and different ambitions see the group dissipate and veer off in their different, destructive directions.Hip hop culture certainly dominates the charts today, with its influence even present in other genres of music that are doing the rounds. Straight Outta Compton attempts to probe the origins of a group that subverted the genre, and used it as a platform to vent their anger and frustration at the issues that blighted their lives in the black community at the time, in a manner that some artists over time took out of context and warped into the gangsta rap genre. Director F Gary Grey has certainly compiled a thorough, in depth study of the group's life, which by the end has left you more drained than informed.The film has a lot of story to tell, but somehow lacks the solid narrative structure to make everything have the maximum effect. For a film with such a length, this is a pretty big problem, and despite containing enough various, often veering, human drama to engage, at numerous points throughout, you're just left wondering when the ending will roll around, probably a natural reaction to not having the most structured story to follow. When it does roll by, you're left feeling completely depleted.The young cast certainly prove realistic incarnations of the group, whilst as the most recognizable member of the cast, Giamatti turns in a surprisingly impassioned performance as the manager who believes in them, then comes to be regarded as sneaky and manipulative. The recreation and performances are all check, but it maybe needed some miles clocked off, and a better idea of where it's going. ***",7,4,29,28 March 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," A truly remarkable film
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Rookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly remarkable. *****",10,108,170,16 November 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," A blazing, more than satisfactory conclusion to Nolan's dark franchise
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningUnable to face the public after being held responsible for the death of the apparent 'people's hero' Harvey Dent, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) goes into hiding, along with his alter ego Batman. Which is bad news, as Gotham City faces a new maniac intent on causing destruction and breaking the people's thin social fabric, in the shape of Bane (Tom Hardy), who sets off a massive explosion at a football stadium and lets the citizens of Gotham know that one of them holds the key to an even bigger explosive device. In his quest to restore order, Batman finds himself saddled with Selina Kyle a.k.a. Cat Woman (Anne Hathaway) who is by turns a sidekick and a nemesis.If something is hotly anticipated, it's always the worst kind of publicity when something shocking happens when it finally arrives after ages of waiting. The events in Colarado with the maniac and his shootings at their premiere of The Dark Knight Rises have left a dour taste in the mouths of many, with Warner Brothers even refusing to release the films box office takings until next week. Whether this tragic event will come to hold a darker history over this film than Heath Ledger's death in the run up to it's predecessor's, only time will tell. But when the dust has settled, what we have is, what I only learned last week, the last of Christopher Nolan's Batman films. And, like a conductor rounding off his master symphony, he's pulled out all the stops to deliver a distinctively dark, explosive, action packed, deep and thought provoking film that is the concluding part to what can proudly be called the most mature super hero series ever made.After turning Tim Burton's campy Jack Nicholson Joker on it's head with Ledger's contrasting demented, soulless maniac, here Nolan transforms Bane from the lumbering, graceless dummy Joel Schumacher made him and gives him a terrifying, unnerving presence all of his own, brought to life in a scene stealing way by Hardy, in a mask totally covering the centre of his face that gives his voice a parodiable but scary sound of it's own. Meanwhile, in contrast with Michelle Phyiffer's passive doormat who turns into Batman's toughest female opponent, Hathaway's Kyle is a deceptive wolf in sheep's clothing, who manages to runs rings around Wayne and the bad guys. Once again, Nolan's Batman series touches on relevant modern social issues, like the very real threat we all live under in this day and age of terrorism, as well as a subtle reference to how the underdogs in society are going to rise up and take some of the wealth 'from those who have more than enough', in line with the rioting that has kicked off across Europe within the last year or so. Some may well just hark back to the old days, when Batman was campy and fun, but Nolan has undeniably delivered a masterful re-imagining of the franchise, which he rounds off here like Sinatra's My Way. ****",9,2,7,24 July 2012

Iron Man," Tries very hard, but fails to come off as truly memorable
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is one of the world's most renowned arms manufacturers/sellers, who is able to live a funky, eccentric lifestyle on the back of the success of his Stark Industries company. But this all changes when he goes to Afghanistan to show off his latest weapon and is taken hostage by terrorists and forced to build a weapon for them. Instead, he builds a super-hero suit and uses it to break free and go back to America, where he reveals a change of heart in relation to his profession and tries to aim his talents more at peace than war. But this doesn't go down well with his boss Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who's only worried about the profits they will lose now Tony no longer wants to make weapons. And when Tony learns that his company has been making under-handed deals with the men who held him captive, he uses the super-hero suit he made once again and becomes Iron Man. But his corrupt boss has ideas of his own in regards making his own super-hero suit...You can always count on a good super-hero film to fill in the obligatory summer blockbuster slot in the filmic year, and this year we have this adaptation of one of Marvel Comic's truly lesser known creations, which just shows how far towards the bottom of the barrel we're scraping. An ambitious piece that seems to have caught onto the trend of making extra long summer blockbusters, this tries to invest a lot of unnecessary depth and characterization into a story that's ultimately not worth the effort.It just feels overlong instead of something really special. Okay, Iron Man isn't your typical action hero. He doesn't just magically get his super powers like Superman or Spider-Man, we see him struggle to get his super-suit to work, failing to guide it properly and make the special gadgets work, but the whole piece just feels overly labourious, with an uninvolving, predictable script that fails to rise out the ground.Cast wise, in the lead role, Downey Jr. is an odd but admittently effective choice, a snazzy, cynical anti hero who slowly sees through his own BS but he's just not enough to keep the whole boat afloat. Bridges is also a decent choice as the villain, but the weak script fails to make the most out of him, while in support rising star Terrence Howard goes through the motions as a comic relief Air Force colonel and Gwyneth Paltrow is noticeable as a personal assistant with a ridiculous name.All these type of films just seem so manufactured nowadays, with so much back story stretching them out so long and enough publicity to guarantee a great opening weekend and an obligatory equally inferior sequel a year or so later. For all it's quantity instead of quality, Iron Man truly has an Iron Soul. **",4,4,10,12 May 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Unanimously panned monstrosity that had all the warning lights flashing
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After a series of catastrophic disasters, the public turn their scorn on Superman (Henry Cavill), feeling that a man with his powers just doesn't belong on their planet. Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) is concerned that he may simply be a menace in disguise, and prepares to go to war with him as Batman. But a new threat to world peace emerges in the shape of Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg), who wants to harness an energy source to wreak global havoc. The two rival superheroes must come together, along with fellow warrior Diana Prince a.k.a. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) in order to stop Luthor's diabolical plan.A combination of bad feeling and word of mouth stopped me from seeing this film in what could be described as its natural format on the big screen when it came out over here at the end of March, and its taken till now for me to witness it in all its gory glory. Reading like some ten year old kid in the playground's nonsensical fantasy, and playing out not much differently, director Zack Snyder has really scraped the bottom of the barrel and produced the most desperate, pitiful piece of filmmaking I think I've seen all year, a monumental monstrosity with no sense of fun, wonder or excitement whatsoever.Such a flimsy excuse for a premise was hardly going to produce much in the way of a decent story, and this is all a really jumbled, plot less, incoherent mess that I struggled to produce a plot summary for, if I'm honest. For a more condensed piece, this would be bad enough, but stretching at nearly two and a half hours, its just taking the biscuit. But what makes it even worse is the sheer overbearing earnestness of it all, taking something so throwaway and making it more grim and moody than the fall of Rome. Even Wonder Woman loses her old school schiztzy appeal, and its just a terribly humourless bore all round.Performances wise, Affleck is the most stiff, uptight Bruce Wayne/Batman there ever was, while Cavill and love interest Amy Adams have nothing to lose as Superman and Lois, having already established their personas in 2013's less than well received Man of Steel. But worst of all is Eisenberg as Luthor, who delivers the most jabbering, irritating maniacal performance ever, but just looks miscast in the role anyway, whilst Gadot just feels wasted as the new Wonder Woman. A colourful support cast including Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne and Jeremy Irons as Alfred also fail to add any spice.Its every bit as bad as they said, and if 1997's Batman and Robin was the franchise as its worst in the camp style, this is just as big if not worse an atrocity in the dark, brooding one. *",2,7,16,22 November 2016
The Greatest Showman," Interesting, invigorating feast of colour and action
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the 1800s, P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman), an orphaned, penniless boy from a poor background, marries Charity (Michelle Williams), the daughter of his wealthy foster parents, and travels to the city to start a new life with her. Unable to settle into a boring, humdrum life, Barnum envisions creating the world's first circus, in the shape of a 'freak show', gathering together a group of social outcasts, and getting respected writer Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) to help him, until success starts to go to his head...The musical is a cinematic art form that is enjoyed much more rarely these days, which makes it all the more special when one does roll around. Usually at times like Christmas, such was the case with The Greatest Showman. Director Michael Gracey, making his feature length debut, has chosen an inspiring choice in the shape of Barnum, whose story of bringing a colourful carnival to life certainly provides a lot of potential for rousing musical numbers and colourful dance sequences. But what really seems to be behind this number, made in modern times, is a message of acceptance, with a nod to the LGBTQ movement, in the shape of the bearded woman being part of the story.It's interesting, given the film's rousing central tune and tone in general, that the central character promotes them in such a politically incorrect way, billing them as a freak show, certainly something that wouldn't be accepted in modern times. But it's the portrayal of Barnum and his attitude to his subjects in general that's the most surprising, being far more motivated for the fame and fortune they can bring him, rather than their feelings or dignity, even side lining his own family as his ego grows bigger. But Jackman still manages to portray him with the nice guy edge that makes most of his roles so personal.It's a rare musical, and a musical for modern times, and as such is still a nice, pleasant piece of work the whole family can get some nice enjoyment from. ****",9,1,4,27 May 2018
Casino Royale," Mostly quite good, but unfortunately not the perfect film everyone's been saying it is
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning With the latest Bond film, with a new look and a new Bond (Daniel Craig) having run out of new films to make, we've gone right back to the beginning, as Bond makes the first two kills necessary to become a 00. Meanwhile, the villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelson) a brilliant but corrupt banker takes some money from a Ugandan terrorist group to invest in an act of terror that will shock the world. But things don't go to plan (on account of Bond) and he is forced to compete in a high stakes poker tournament at the titular Casino Royale in Montenegroe in order to win the money to pay off the deadly criminals who have lost money- but, once again, Bond, with the aid of beautiful but canny MI6 agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) is on hand to stop him.I read a little letter that was sent to the Daily Mirror a few weeks ago that mentioned how years ago a new Bond film was just something to go and see to have a good time to but nowadays there was so much hype and publicity surrounding the release of a new film that it was as if your life depended on going to see it and that people should grow up. With all the build-up to the release of this new film, I can certainly see what they meant and felt something niggling inside me when the film had been out for a few weeks and I still hadn't got round to seeing it. What seemed worse was all the people raving about it and how left out I'd feel if I found faults in it. Well, I've tried my best to be as positive as I can about Casino Royale (and there is quite a bit to be happy about) but it's not as if I didn't notice the faults as well.Starting on a high note, Craig is a fine Bond, and following all the tension as to whether he'd cut the mustard in the role, it's quite relieving to see he more than measures up to the role. The supporting cast are up to the mark too, Green a sexy and intelligent Bond girl, and Mikkelson a convincing and cold villain. As well as them, we have Martin Campbell, who also directed another (superior) Bond film Goldeneye, back in the director's seat, which is re-assuring but undelivering. The film can also boast some quite spectacular cinematography as the camera swoops over the gorgeous hills and seas of Montenegroe.Being an action film, though, it should also boast some great, spectacular action scenes, and there simply aren't enough of these, with too many talky scenes going on as the action takes place during the poker game at the casino which starts to bore a bit after a while. It also suffers from an ending with too much tacked on and which drags on a bit as a result.The film could have been a bit better paced and even a bit better edited, but there are a lot of positive things to write home about and Craig has certainly made an impact as the new Bond, and I look forward to his next (hopefully even better) adventure. ****",9,1,2,23 December 2006

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the toy gang still reside in Andy's bedroom in his old home...but he's grown up now and ready to move out to college, and the time has come for some of the toys to head up to the attic...and some to head to the trash! The gang find themselves, by default, in the ownership of a day care centre, which is in the grip of the seemingly kindly Lotso Lovin' Bear (Ned Beatty) who secretly runs a tyrannical control over everything there. Woody, Buzz and his love interest Jessie (Joan Cusack), must work together to save the day and say goodbye to Andy before it's too late.All good things seem to come in threes, and certainly, it would seem the best film franchises need to have a perfect three o to make themselves complete- Terminator, Godfather, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (?!?)...some even spoil it by veering into foursies- Lethal Weapon, Alien, Rambo...but three, as De La Soul once said, certainly seems to be the magic number. And, the third part to Toy Story has certainly kept a novelty in the bag...by making it a 3D experience, with the chance to see it in 3D glasses that hardly bring everything out right in front of your eyes, but illuminate it enough so that it stands out from any of the other films. Luckily, though, the more superficial stuff like that doesn't override the same charm and good writing that made the last two as bearable for adults as fun for kids.Not a massive lot really stands out, formula wise, from the other two films, other than perhaps a slightly veering slant towards less of a happy ending than a conclusion to what could either be a brilliant trilogy or a never-ending, soulless stream of sequels. As it does, it goes for a more darker, human edge to the characters and story, drawing us towards a genuinely thrilling, seat edge conclusion, that at first seems a cheeky homage to Arnie's demise at the end of Terminator 2, but in fact comes to stand alone perfectly as it's own great ending, before a sentimental, gushy final part that if it doesn't round the story off, at least sets it in stead for a new chapter.It goes without saying that the animation/graphics are all brilliant as ever, and that the geniuses at Disney/Pixar have done their thing to great effect once again. Truly, whatever they've already done and whatever they will do in the future, the Toy Story series will stand alone as one of, if not their best, achievement ever. *****",10,1,1,30 September 2010
Trainspotting," Brilliant
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs Renton (Ewan McGregor) is a heroin addict who's making one last ditch,final attempt to kick himself into gear for good.The film basically follows the fortunes and mis-fortunes of himself,his friends Spud (Ewen Bremner),non-drug user Tommy (Kevin McKidd),Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle) as they venture from triumpth to tragedy,before the ending rolls by determining whether they really will decide to settle down and 'choose life.' It's funny,because the last film I reviewed,yesterday,Mean Streets was also a film that launched some actors to super-stardom,and this did exactly the same for some fine Scottish talents.Ewan McGregor's a big star in Hollywood now,but never has he delivered a performance as heartfelt and honest as he does in the lead role here.He no doubt looks back nowaday and thinks so himself.He carries the film perfectly,but all the supporting cast do a tremendous job of things as well,especially Miller as the well-spoken and thoroughly engaging Sick Boy and Carlyle in mesmerizing debut form as the psychotic,ultra violent,knife wielding thug Begbie,a performance he contrasted well with his much calmer,more reserved approach in coming roles.The film is set in Edinburgh,the drug capital of the UK,and catches well the social depravity and decay running rampant in certain areas there that allowed it to get this way.But this film's major achievement is portraying the pleasant and dreamy social isolation of the heroin addict in relation to the rest of society going on around them.It also brilliantly contrasts the life of the heroin addict with the supposedly conformist,non-questioning,ultra-boring existence of the average joe.As the film says,choose life,but why would you want to do a thing like that?But it's also careful to show the devastating downside of drug mis-use,none more powerfully than watching the Tommy character's orderly,well-kept house (in relation to the squalid existence of the others!) deteriorate pretty rapidly from his first experimentation with heroin into a dead-aired,stripped,dark tomb,not to mention his horrifying physical decline from a healthy,athletic football player into a slumping,pale wreck.This is most noticeable,but McGregor also delivers a chilling cold turkey scene in his bedroom,showing hallucinations involving his so-called mates and dead babies crawling across his ceiling.In fact,there's a scene involving a dead baby which in itself is fairly nasty.It also benefits from a great soundtrack,from artists as diverse as Iggy Pop to Ice MC,which is well used to compliment each scene the given track is allocated to.The 90s was the decade in which the British Film Industry really found it's feet and took off (despite some of the crocks of sh*t it tends to release nowadays!) and Trainspotting played a big part,along with the likes of Secrets and Lies and The Full Monty,in doing this.And so it should have.*****",10,0,0,24 April 2005
Signs," Quite possibly M. Night Shyamalan's finest work to date
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsFrom the off-point,it's astounding to note that,yes,this is a new film directed by hot-property Shyamalan that doesn't headbill Bruce Willis as the main star.Instead,we've got Mel Gibson.So,a change of leading man and a change of film for this particular actor.And he's fine in a type of role you wouldn't usually expect him to do.But Gibson's not the only commendable thing about Signs.Following on from a catchy opening credits sequence,the story which precedes it is deeply intriguing and full of jolty surprises and eye-catching special effects.Joaquin Phoenix is good in it too as the normality-driven younger brother of Gibson,desperate to do anything to restore order to the paranoia stricken family,already struggling to come to terms with a soul-destroying tragedy.If there's one fault,it's probably the ending,which does come off as a little silly and far-fetched,even for this type of film.But generally speaking,Signs is top-notch entertainment,and certainly a strong contender for Shyamalan's finest work.****",Null,0,5,8 October 2002

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIdentity is intriguing stuff,make no bones about it.The suspense is gripping (quite often seat edge),and there are a number of exciting twists and turns in the story.But then this is exactly what the premise of the story promised.This is the second film of director James Mangold's that I've seen after Cop Land six years ago,which was a very enjoyable film.And one of that film's cast members,Ray Liotta,has returned,along with a variatable host of others,ranging from John Cusack,Amanda Peet,Alfred Molina,Clea DuVall,John C. McGinley and Rebecca De Mornay.All of them are impressive in slightly stereotypical but ultimately effective roles.The film has some eerie jolting moments and plenty of tense scenes to add sustainance,which is the type of movie it promised to be and what it ultimately succeeds in being.There are a few minor quibbles with it,I suppose,but ultimately it's great to see movies like this still being made with all the rubbish that gets released in this day and age.****",Null,0,1,16 June 2003
Saving Mr. Banks," A competent, interesting and relevant film that hits all the right notes
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningReclusive novelist P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) staunchly refuses to share her literary masterpiece Mary Poppins with anyone, despite being pestered for the film rights numerous times by different people. But she has fallen on hard times and there look set to be even tougher times ahead. So, on the persuasion of her agent, she flies off to America and has a meeting with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), the most well known man on earth in the early 60's. Initially reluctant and extremely difficult, Travers is also horrified at the thought of Disney making it in to one of his ghastly animations, which she detests. But gradually, the fairy tale mogul wears down her tough exterior and as the film progresses, we learn of the tragic back story of Travers's childhood that nevertheless formed the basis of the fantasy world she escaped to to create her wonder yarn.Working in a children's hospital, occasionally you'll pass a television set with a DVD playing to keep the kids amused while they wait for an appointment or something, so it's only comparatively recently that the magic of Mary Poppins has entered my life. Kids, or family, films aren't generally the type of thing I go for, as my comments listings will attest to, but something about this film still grabbed my heart enough to become a film I now own. So, in the 50th anniversary of the film's first release, this inspired and enlightening film is highly relevant and was certainly well worth my time, shining some light on the production difficulties the film encountered, not least Travers's awkward, hostile personality. Though well written, the script sometimes makes Travers come off as cartoonishly eccentric and over the top at times, and you're left wondering how it would have been possible for anyone, even Disney, to possibly make her come round.And yet, throughout the film's tough depiction of her, this is juxtaposed with flashbacks to her childhood spent in rural Australia, where her even more outlandish father fueled her mind with his free spirit and boundless imagination. But his was a tragic existence, blighted by drink and self destruction. And yet, he imparted the words of wisdom that let her mind flourish, 'never to let the world grind you down with how it is, and to keep your imagination alive.' From this, her more human side comes to life, and our dislike gradually simmers to empathy.Needless to say, if the idea behind the film wasn't exciting enough, it's even more exhilarating with the performers involved, and they all turn in reliably stellar performances. Hanks once again captures the manner and style of his charge with aplomb, bringing a real life character to the screen unlike anyone before him, while national treasure Thompson is perfectly suited to the role of Travers, and there's great support from Colin Farrell, unrecognizable at first as the dad, and Paul Giamatti as Travers's put upon chauffeur.It's a magical examination of the magic, that will please the long time and even the more recent devotees of Poppins. ****",9,0,2,9 September 2014
Live Free or Die Hard," Takes a while to get there, but you'll be glad you saw it by the end
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning John McClaine (Bruce Willis) everyone's favourite wise-cracking cop from the last three Die Hard films- is back, older, wiser and crankier. This time he's got a teenage daughter in tow who's rebelling against him and he's just learned of a successful hack-in to a top government agency's central computer. But the authorities are convinced they've caught the culprit, young cyber-nerd Justin (Matt Ferrell.) So McClaine's sent round to apprehend him- only to be nearly annihilated in a barrage of bullets along with his charge. And so begins a relentless and deadly chase around New York city, with chases, bullets and mayhem in tow- and as they move along, they start to learn of a much deadlier conspiracy than any of them ever imagined.Resembling, as others have noted, with his bald head and notable paunch, Homer Simpson more than your average action hero, Willis returns in the latest entry into the Die Hard franchise since 1995's less than scintillating entry Die Hard: With a Vengeance. With a topical plot line involving terrorism and technology controlling us, the fourth instalment copies it's most recent predecessor by throwing us headlong straight into the action rather than establishing too much of a story first.It will probably come as no surprise to most to learn that the plot is just an excuse to make one big gun battle happen after another, the script isn't much better, the characters (especially the villains!) are as cardboard as a display stand and the less said about the dialogue, the better. Unfortunately, to start with, aside from a few tasty scenes, there isn't a lot of exciting action either, causing you to start to write it off as a failure early on in (not a good sign!) But if you stick around long enough, trust me you won't be disappointed, as the ending builds up to some truly spectacular action scenes, one involving a bridge, that will make you glad you gave your time and money.By the end, you're satisfied with the brilliant action and the tense thrill ride that got you there. And, while everything that may have made it an Oscar contender leaves a lot to be desired, if you're happy with the action, you can come away and say you saw a pretty damn fine Die Hard film. ****",9,0,2,15 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," Watchable enough,I guess
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsI actually watched this on Wednesday,but,on leaving the cinema,I was a little unsure on what I thought of it,to be honest.Over the past two days,I've had some time to give it some consideration.And I've managed to get over a few of the misgivings I might have had about it.Coming from Bryan Singer,who helmed the original,it stood a chance in my mind anyway of matching that film's dark,gothic feel and sense of creativity.Then again,the sequel to Men in Black was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld,who directed that film's original,and that was easily the worst film of last year.Then again,this film was made a lot sooner than the other one,and is ,at the very least,more relevant.One of the driving forces behind it's existence was obviously to make lots of money by capitalizing on the success of the original,but then aren't these films always?But,compared to a lot of the other no brainer drudge fests that have occupied our screens of late,X2 certainly respects your intelligence at least.Speaking of the direction,Singer guides a stern,thoughtful script along evenly,and wisely adds touches of flair and humour in at appropriate interludes,meaning the affair never becomes too heavy handed.On the performances front,as the two older members of the central cast,Ian McKellen and good ol' Patrick Stewart craft some marvellous,engaging chemistry between themselves as the intermittent good friends/deadliest adversaries and can pretty much play each other off like chess players.Sure,a fair bit of the dialogue they are given to work with is pretty tired and cliched,but it's that undeniably infectuous sense of commaradere that engages the audience's emotions so well.It's also a good examination of how,indeed,the best of friends can be the most powerful of enemies.Brian Cox is convincingly twisted as the main villain here,whilst Hugh Jackman remains fun in the leading role and male testosterone levels can reach mammoth heights at the sight of Halle Berry in a long leather coat.And Alan Cumming makes an above average but below fantastic debut as 'the Nightcrawler'.Some may argue it's overlong.Others may argue it's providing a greater level of character development and enforcing it's social message more.Some may argue it's just an inevitable but fun and slick Summer blockbuster,that isn't in T2 leagues of greatness,but certainly not a bad night out at the pics and easily one of the best sequels in a long time.***",Null,0,3,30 May 2003
Lucy," Overwhleming and over the top action thriller that forgets to be any fun
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) has to deliver a briefcase to Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi) a Chinese gangster, but finds herself double crossed by her partner and becomes an unwitting host for a new synthetic drug that allows humans to use 100% of their brain, along with a group of other subjects. But she fights back, and with the help of hotshot cop Del Toro (Amr Waked) seeks to track down the benevolent Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman), who's spearheading some pioneering research in to the field of mind drugs.In a sea of mindless, wham-bam thank ya mam action flicks, French auteur Luc Besson has, with Lucy, tried to craft that rarest of breeds, a thinking man's action film that gets you to summon a bit of the grey matter in the midst of all the noise and explosions, even if he's admitted taking some creative license with a bit of the scientific truth behind it. The idea of experimental new drugs being used to enhance the mind's ability is a ripe idea for such a film. But, crucially before this, you need to care about the characters involved, and you need to make the film a bit of fun, two things Lucy completely fails to do.We find ourselves just thrust in to the action, without any sort of introduction or character development, and so it's impossible to care about this character or any of the problems that face her, as she single-handedly wipes out gangs of villainous mobsters with an unexplained sense of efficiency. The film is so swept up in the grandeur of it's clever idea that it just becomes overwhelmingly cerebral and far fetched, without a hint of humour or more easy going stuff.Yes, it gives you something to think about, but without solid writing or a lead character to root for, you just can't think about it as much as you could. At least it's blissfully short. **",4,0,3,23 January 2015

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A full scale, all action epic that brings the franchise back to life
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Luke Skywalker has mysteriously vanished, leaving the Resistance in dire straits. In his absence, the First Order, lead by the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), have begun implementing their will with force. Finn (John Boyega), a disillusioned Storm Trooper, absconds from his post, and joins forces with Rey (Daisy Ridley), a feisty female warrior who has in her company BB8, a droid who may hold the key to Skywalker's whereabouts. The pair are joined by Han Solo and Chewbacca in their mission as it progresses.While I've never been the biggest Star Wars devotee, I have always admired it for the great, epic film that it was, and always found it incredible how something like that could have been produced so many decades ago. Over the years, the series has certainly attracted a lot of followers, and while a lot of people have bemoaned the craze of grown adults blatantly exhibiting their passion in public, in a sense it has recreated a sense of community and kinship that a trip to the cinema has lacked for many years. The publicity for JJ Abrams big screen re-invention has certainly been pretty relentless, and you'd certainly have felt left out not going on the big opening weekend.One of the key themes of this big venture is exploring one of the Storm Troopers as a human being (they were all robots, as far as I was concerned!) and the examination of conscience that gets provoked in one of them. This creates a character ark that serves as a reference point to the story, and gives it some flair. With the fans spanning over so many years, it was necessary to create something that appealed to old and young, and so we have younger stars Ridley and Boyega, whilst returning old favourites Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford, reprising the second of the two roles that made his name. None human old favourites C-3PO and R2-D2 return too, along with the aforementioned BB8, who resembles a Kinder Egg on wheels.The dialogue's still leaves a bit to be desired, and all the mass publicity in the world won't create any more super fans than there already are, but as a SW venture, this ticks all the right boxes, a full on, full scale epic that delivers all the marvellous effects, set design, breath-taking action and just everything you'd expect from the franchise. ****",9,8,31,21 December 2015
RED," Starts well, but soon loses it's way
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a man living a seemingly mundane life, until he finds a group of hired assassins trying to kill him. He then reveals himself as a retired killer, who's on a hit list with a group of other operatives, including Victoria (Helen Mirren), Mathison (Morgan Freeman) and Boggs (John Malkovich) after a mission in South America went wrong. Taking his new girlfriend hostage to keep her safe, the group get their first lead in a murdered journalist and find corruption leading up to the vice president.This high profile action flick has received generally more favourable reviews from the critics. It opens well, setting the tone nicely for more of the same stuff through-out, which is just as well, because action is a genre that desperately needs something to come along and shake it up a bit. But somehow Red doesn't live up to this early promise, and emerges as another example of how the genre can't compare with the sort of classics it used to be known for (for this critic, anyway.) The story just feels really disjointed and hard to get into, not clever enough to be confusing, just...a bit of a mess, really. In the midst of this, it's hard to spot any really exciting action, which only serves to make the pace drag even more.Cast wise, all of them are just working on the personas they're known for, and not to great effect. Willis should manage this sort of thing in his sleep, but here can't make his wise cracking hard man act stand out much, ditto Morgan Freeman, who's just softly spoken again, and wise cracking here and there, while Malkovich does his wacky eccentric thing to the most annoying effect he can. Only Mirren offers anything resembling class and gravitas, with her presence in the film. Generally a mess, this finds itself in the 'red' from very early on, and doesn't stray away from this. **",4,7,12,23 May 2011
Flight," Glossy, brave big budget character study that doesn't feel completely the sum of it's parts
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningWhip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is a respected, seasoned airline pilot who presents a respectable image to the public, but behind the scenes leads a debauched life of drink, drugs and wanton women. He ends up flying a plane while drugs and alcohol are still in his system, which just so happens to crash. However, Whitaker's actions on board undoubtedly save more lives than could have been taken. But the powers that be need a scapegoat and as investigations in to his private life begin, he starts to spiral madly out of control.It remains an undisputed statistical fact that air travel is the safest form of transportation, although ironically it's still probably the most unduly feared. It may be the grand scale of a plane's design that gives people the heebie jeebies, making the thought of crashing in it more than any other form of transport more daunting. With this in mind, a grand Hollywood picture would have to make a crash scenario as realistic as possible, and not just play on people's fears. Flight does a good job of doling out the tension in the build up to the big disaster, allowing time to pass and a relaxed mood to settle in before the impact hits. With this out the way and the rest of the movie to contend with, Robert Zemekis's film lays out it's grand ambitions and intentions on a plate, and despite basically doing nothing wrong, still comes off not feeling quite the sum of it's parts.In the lead role, Washington has as solid and commanding a presence as ever, portraying a flawed, weak individual, whose undoubtable ability and dedication juxtaposes with that to present someone who just seems on an unexplainable path of self destruction. And, maybe that's the problem. Despite it's sprawling length, the film never really tries to delve in to the psyche of it's protagonist, and offer glimpses in to what might have happened before that makes him tick like he does. Instead, we are left to glare at this tragic figure as he stumbles in to a friendship/romance with recovering addict Norma (Brit girl Kelly Reilly) and fail to stay off the wagon for the inevitable public relations duties he will face, leading on to a slushy, sentimental TV movie ending that will feel cheesy and dated to some. The rest of the support cast includes John Goodman and Don Cheadle, supporting players who end up feeling as un/explored as the lead character.Zemekis undoubtedly presents an intriguing, ambitious character study here that aims for something higher than your typical Hollywood yarn, and he has phenomenal talent to pull it off. Sadly, while far from a failure, it just doesn't feel as much of a success as it could have been. ***",7,1,1,11 June 2013
Unbroken," Disappointing dramatisation of epic true life tale
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As the Second World War looms on the horizon, Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connoll) is an Olympic athlete, destined for greatness at the 1936 games in Berlin. On the outbreak of the war, he is serving in the Air Force when his plane is shot down, and he and his two co-pilots are forced to survive, alone and stranded in the sea in a dinghy for forty five days. But this is just the beginning of their nightmare, before they are captured and held as prisoners of war, by the vicious Watanabe (Miyavi) and his army. Against incredible odds, Louis finds the strength to persevere and emerge triumphant against Watanabe's cruelty.If something is going to get a glossy, big screen Hollywood showboating, then far better that it's an inspirational, true life tale than just another loud, mindless 'popcorn' flick, with everything to offer the eye but nothing to offer the mind. And in the tale of Louis Zamperini, Angelina Jolie has certainly found a lot of interesting source material to derive from, charting not only his Olympic victory before the war, but also his drawn out struggles in the yacht, and then his trials and tribulations in the POW camp. Sadly, the execution is more Hallmark TV special than big screen epic.Quite how Jolie has taken so much interesting, potential laden story fodder and made it all so unaffecting is just baffling. Everything just plays out so mundanely, with the most flat, stilted dialogue that makes it feel more suited to a smaller scale TV production than the big screen. Performances wise, it's pretty much all resting on O'Connoll, who carries everything (literally, at the end) and serves as the driving force of the film. He doesn't do a bad job, but you're always on eggshells waiting to see when his American accent falters and his native Derby comes piping back to the surface. That said, Miyavi also has presence as the cold, cruel commander.Overall, though, this is just an unfortunate let down. **",4,0,0,5 March 2016

As a panic attack sees him and some other trip members hauled off, it is not long before this is exactly what happens. But it seems the hands of fate that saw the deaths of all those on the plane has not stopped at the survivors and Alex and the rest of them soon find themselves in a terrifying wrangle with the hands of death itself.Despite the very interesting and original concept, the FD movies were ones I'd failed to pay much attention to until weirdly enough the promotional poster for Part 3 made me want to go see that, but I thought it would be a good idea to get acquainted with Part 1 (and maybe Part 2) first and with this first movie making an appearance on Channel 4 at the weekend (obviously on the back of the new film) I took my chance.This is an interesting idea for a horror movie, because unlike the usual phantoms and boogeymen characters in these films must overcome, here the protagonist is the very phantom force all of us will tangle with at some point: death itself. It's a real, believable evil and the original concept is used very effectively, even if I found some of the plot developments a bit predictable.The movie also suffers from a naff character in the shape of Sean William Scott. But from title to idea, this is a clever movie indeed, with some typically inventive death scenes for this genre. ***",7,1,4,22 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Perfect viewing (maybe at 11.00 at night!!!)

The Purge," Superb, short and sweet little cult offering
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn a futuristic America, unemployment and crime have been virtually eradicated, thanks to 'the purge', an annual night a year where all crime, including murder, is legalized for twelve hours. One family who choose not to participate are the Sandins, headed by father James (Ethan Hawke), who choose the 'lock down' option in their fancy home. However, things get complicated when a homeless man approaches their door, begging to be let in before he is torn to pieces by a blood thirsty mob.It seems if an idea isn't far fetched and off the wall enough, it can certainly be sick and twisted enough to get your attention. The Purge, the latest offering from the man who was either the director of Insidious and/or the producer of Sinister or something or other, certainly wants to expose the dark heart of humanity at it's centre, but maybe it isn't as far fetched as you might first think. It presents a, somewhat controversial, but certainly thought provoking idea of how to stamp out crime from society that provides real food for thought and forces the viewer to look inside themselves and truly examine their morals and conscience.It's certainly a challenging spectacle that delivers more of itself and gets more out of you than you might have thought. In a day and age of hackneyed, tired scripts and plot lines, The Purge is genuinely suspenseful and unpredictable through out and the edge of your seat is truly where you'll be. Yes, it may follow suit with all the other modern fright flicks with it's over reliance on jump scenes to get scares, but with an intelligent script and taut direction behind it, they serve a function rather than just being meaningless window dressing.There may be a lack of political correctness to it that might put off some, but The Purge is so much more complex and surprising than you expect it to be, it stands on it's own as something to be admired. *****",10,11,22,12 June 2013

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A true story from Steven Spielberg, depicting the massacre at the 1972 Munich Olympics by Palestinian fundamentalists of Israli athletes and the subsequent and immediate backlash by the Israeli authorities who wanted swift retribution for the atrocity.On the day I went to see Munich, I'd had to get up a bit earlier than I usually would to go to a (distant) relative's funeral in the morning and I'd travelled straight from there to another destination up to see it, so maybe that had worn me out a bit, or maybe I just wasn't in the right frame of mind to sit through it on the day, but either way after about two thirds of the way through this 164 minute Spielberg saga, I must admit I found myself nodding off for a little while. Or maybe it was just that, despite the thought-provoking and inspired subject matter, Munich could emerge as a fairly boring film in parts, which is a bit of a problem for films this long. I'd sat through and enjoyed a similar sort of film from Spielberg, Schindler's List, which I ended up rating as one of the best films I'd ever seen, but I was able to see that at my own leisure on video, unlike Munich.In between making big special effects filled blockbusters like War of the Worlds and Jurassic Park, Spielberg likes to make more deep and meaningful stuff like this and Schindler's List as well, making him a varied sort of film-maker. I admire him for this and like to try and give more credit to this sort of work than his cinematic eye-candy stuff. But I just didn't see Munich as a perfect work.Maybe there wasn't enough humour and light-heartedness in it, maybe there is something morally black about the story. It certainly has a strong cast to guide it, in the shape of Eric Bana, Daniel Craig and some Israeli supporting cast members, as well as a good story to go with it. But as interesting as Munich can be, it can be just as boring in equal measure. ***",7,3,4,24 February 2006
The Matrix," Rather overrated.
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable.****Very Good.***Okay.**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead.*Avoid At All Costs.I've got a simple synopsis for what some are trying to class as the greatest movie of the year:impressive ideas/lines,impressive effects......muddled execution.As ever,this is one of those movies you're probably better off catching at the cinema because the special effects will probably have greater effect there.Seen on small screen,they look a bit cramped.It's nice to see Keanu Reeves back again after such a notably long stretch,but the simple fact remains,he is something of a wooden actor,and not the easiest screen persona to warm to to make it any better,e.g. as in the case of Chuck Norris.Laurence Fishburne,as ever,is ace but even he can't really seem to make sight nor sense of this rather lame material for plot development.I could'nt understand what on earth was going on throughout.In it's favour,the special effects were impressive.The giant bug like things were super.I'd say this was a Sci-Fi film in which you had to use your brain ,only for this you'd need a coherent plot of sorts.In my harshest tone,I could accuse The Matrix of being complete technobabble.The ending is a bit daft,too.So,overall,I'd say The Matrix was an intelligent,original Sci-Fi movie which was a bit too long and did'nt really handle it's source material to well.So,go figure.***",Null,4,10,1 December 1999
Looper," Over the top sci-fi actioner that probably wouldn't even be better on a second viewing
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the year 2074, Joe (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a contract killer who eliminates targets sent from the future on behalf of the mob. However, one night his associate Seth (Paul Dano), visits him in distress, saying how he's failed to kill a contract, that appears to be an older version of himself sent from the future. Pursued by mob boss Abe (Jeff Daniels) and his gang, Joe must keep his watchful eye on him, until he makes the same mistake and fails to kill his older self (Bruce Willis.) The pair form an uneasy partnership as they evade capture, while looking out for the mysterious 'Rainmaker', who will close all the 'loops' and wipe them all out.In the 80s, and some of the 90s, Bruce Willis's name could be guaranteed to be splashed across the poster of the latest, big budget action movie, and although he basically played himself in every one of them, his presence and star quality could carry it through. But, now noticeably older and greyer, his name is pushed to the supporting side of the poster, and he's less of a big deal. But then, action films, and indeed films in general, would seem to have changed since then, and now film makers seem to be trying to out do each other with how cerebral they can make their film. With Looper, Rian Johnson is obviously quite influenced by Christopher Nolan, and his style of film making. But, while Inception really pushed the mind beyond it's boundaries, Looper just gets lost in the process.Johnson sails his project along, clearly thinking it's the most intelligent and sophisticated thing since sliced bread, but although it might appeal to the most pretentious film students and academics, I think the average person will just find it really over complicated and far fetched, if not downright nonsensical. Wisely, Johnson doesn't become self indulgent and drag it out any way over two hours, but even by this time it feels it's dragged on and has become incredibly boring. Performances wise, in the lead roles, Gordon-Levitt and Willis create a fairly decent double act, but it's the supporting cast who let it down. Dano was brilliant as the weak preacher in There Will Be Blood, but turns in a pretty terrible performance here, really whiny and irritating, while as the villain, Daniels still can't shake off being Harry from Dumb and Dumber.It's clear this will become a cult film, a real love it or hate it case. but I think the two camps will be pretty distinctive on both sides. **",4,1,3,16 October 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the first great 'epic' movies
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning An unbelievable thirty years after it was first released, George Lucas's epic fantasy Star Wars still looks amazingly fresh and fantastical and has left an indelible impression on sci-fi fans and movie lovers, young and old, across the world.I can't recite every name and thing about the film like your most ardent sci-fi nerd the film's inspired over the years, but the basic sketch of the plot can be described like this. Basically, the universe has been taken over by the Galactic Empire, lead by a treacherous Jedi Knight called Darth Vader (David Prowse- voiced by James Earl Jones) and his commander, a wicked emperor. Worse, they have built a devastating new weapon called The Death Star which could kill many people. The Rebel Alliance, lead by plucky Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) have been fighting back and she has stored some information in an android named R2-D2 (played by Kenny Baker?) which is actually a distress signal that must reach the reclusive warrior Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness.) Instead, the first to find out about it is a young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill.) He becomes determined to bring the Empire down when they murder his family and eventually finds mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who, for a price, takes them on board to lead a battle against the Empire.Whooo, that was quite a complicated plot summary for such a film. But it's detailed plot is probably what's spawned all the madcap fans over the years, who can recite every character and group of characters and moreorless everything to do with this film. It may be 30, but Star Wars can still be regarded as one of the biggest blockbusters of all time, a film that could even put some of today's modern blockbusters to shame. It's one of the biggest sort of 'epic' films ever, massive on spectacle and style, spawning some unforgettable characters including Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader and, of course, the non-human characters Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2. While Ford's career blossomed after this, his co stars Hamill and Fisher weren't so lucky and mostly got work in low budget films, usually straight to video.I can't make out I'm a Star Wars fanatic (as my rubbish plot summary should have proved) but I can still appreciate it for the classic action film it is and how it changed the face of the modern sci-fi film forever. Thirtieth anniversary fever starts here. *****",10,1,2,7 March 2007

Deadpool," Possibly a little too full on, but still a fun and amusing ride
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Former mercenary Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) now ekes out a living as a sort of odd job man for hire when people need the frighteners laid on. Things perk up when he meets Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), the love of his life, and they look set to live the rest of their lives together-until he is hit with late stage cancer in several of his most vital organs. All seems lost, until he is approached by a mysterious agency that says they can cure him, as well as giving him superhuman abilities. It's all just a cruel front, though, so the villainous Ajax (Ed Skrein) can use him to experiment on. Left hideously disfigured, Wade re-invents himself as Deadpool, the ultimate wise-ass, wise-cracking, indestructible tough guy superhero there is.The whole superhero franchise is placed on such a pedestal these days, like the ultimate symbol of high art against which others must compete, so it was begging for something to come along that stripped it of its pomposity, and play out as more of a parody. Deadpool, if it does nothing else right, hits this mark perfectly, from the flashy opening title sequences where insults are replaced by way of crediting the producers and stars of the film, to Reynolds's relentlessly dry, wise-cracking delivery. On this front at least, it works.The reverse story-telling style was something that had taken a little break for a while, but director Tim Miller gives it a second-coming here, a little over-bearing on what is such a short and simplistic tale. The sarcastic humour is what gives it its distinctive charm, but the hand that feeds it becomes its chalice, by at times feeling a little too in your face and full on, even in interludes when a more sombre tone would have fitted.The inclusion of two X-Men characters as comic relief serves to highlight the leap between two CGI creations, and a guy bedecked in a homemade suit, and further highlights how Deadpool stands alone in the crazy Marvel universe. But stand alone he does, and, while at times this feels a little overdone, it's still a funky, funny adaptation of one of Marvel's trickier characters. ***",7,2,12,10 March 2016

Thirteen Days," A very engaging,but typically long Costner film
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsPast years have seen Kevin Costner films which have a tendency of being very lengthy (well into the 3 hour stretch)falling into 2 categories :excellent (JFK) or poor (The Postman,apparently).Luckily however,13 Days falls into the before category ,an interesting indictment of one week in America with President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood)in power that nearly resulted in nuclear war destroying the world.While indeed the subject matter is determinently involving,the film is sadly marred by consisting mostly of talk and not a lot of action,which might result in even the most fundemental of film viewers becoming lathargic,especially ,as mentioned before,given the film's length.It's almost a cast iron guarantee that any film top billing Costner will run for over at least 2 hours,without generalising in any way,shape or form.His (Costner's) performance itself seems very revised and calculated,and becomes engaging for it's ultimate campishness if anything.Whether writing, directing and indeed acting ,the man is just theatrical.Roger Donaldson employs heavy but sweeping direction of the movie,giving it a Hunt For Red October feel in it's conveyance.Greenwood's performance as  the most intrigue surrounded American president of all time is also assuredly down to earth.But the most pressing and disturbing issue of the film is kind of unintentional.It's nearly 40 years after the film is set,and nuclear/atomic weapons of mass destruction crafted by the likes of Russia,Cuba and Iraq are still the things posing the biggest threat to our existence.We may already know the outcome of this film,but isn't it more daunting to think of the outcome of the world?****",Null,0,1,20 March 2001
300," Comparable to Sin City and Gladiator, but is a shallow patch on both those far superior films
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Once upon a time, there were these nice people called the Spartans, who lived by respect and honour, and were raised from a young age to defend their people and their country at all costs. But then these nasty little meanies called the Persians came along and tried to overtake their land. But the brave spartans were having none of it, and lead by their brave leader Leonidas (Gerad Butler) stood up to them, had lots of big bloody battles and fought right to the end. Did they win? You'll have to find out...Following the success of the brilliant Sin City, another Frank Miller 'graphic novel' has been adapted to the big screen, with identical style and visual flair. While SC was set on rainswept, dinghy backstreets featuring characters who shot at each other with guns and knives, 300 is set on wide-open battlefields featuring armies of opposing characters, who clash with swords and shields and fire at each other with hundreds of arrows. The style is just as cool, with slo-mo/sped up shots and flashy, realistic battle violence, and it's a style of filming I'm still getting used to. But somehow, it's never as thrilling as in SC.Butler is clearly aiming to ape Russell Crowe's 'what we do in life...echoes in eternity' speech with his character Leonidas's 'tonight we dine in hell' battle cry but he's a poor man's Maximus Aurilius. The film has a surprising and sometimes effective use of humour in some scenes, but while this is a welcome addition, it doesn't distract from the slow, uninvolving story, the bland script and poor dialogue (as witnessed above.) This is okay at best, really, some nice battle scenes and neat touches here and there, but never the sum of it's parts. Apparently it's historically inaccurate, too. This will only really bother those who study the history the film is based on, of course, but there's plenty more to bother everyone else. **",4,4,6,20 December 2007

Sadly, the joke rate is rather low with this, even though it goes for shock value with morally dubious scenes where Rogan smokes pot while driving and where him and his mate sell the drug to some children.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After George Lucas's Star Wars had wowed the world in 1977, the same world eagerly waited the big sequel that followed three years later, that was loved just as much, in some cases slightly more so, than the first film. It no doubt took twice as much effort to make, and drew in a huger box office crowd, and in doing so The Empire Strikes Back established itself as the film that rivalled the film it followed on from.All the main characters from the first film are back, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and lovable non humans Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, along with new addition Lando (a charismatic turn by Billy Dee Williams) a rogue pal of Han's who's now the head of his own establishment, as well of course as Yoda, the tiny green martian with wisdom who guides Luke on his way. The story's a bit too lost in names of special planets, spaceships and character names that only the most ardent sci-fi nerd is going to follow intently, but once again, the sheer spectacle and grandeur of Lucas's work over-shadows everything, a remarkable vision that still hasn't dated or staled over 25 years on.So sit back, relax and prepare to witness the sheer scale of escapist entertainment. *****",10,3,6,1 April 2007

But a mysterious villain called The Screen-slaver plunges The Incredibles, and their cohort Frozone (Samuel L Jackson) into a battle where no one is who they appear to be...We seem to be under attack from a barrage of sequels lately, some to fairly recent films and others to films from a while back that never got their follow up when they were flavour of the month, such as this sequel to the animated 2004 superhero satire The Incredibles. That said, they will only ever make sequels to films that were in any way a success, and so the comparatively lukewarm fanfare this sequel received was telling in itself. I certainly took my time going to see it, even after being very impressed with the first one, not least because I didn't relish sitting in an auditorium on my own packed with noisy, screaming kids. So, of course, I went to see it yesterday on a Bank Holiday Monday, thinking it wouldn't be so bad because it had been out a while and the showtimes were less frequent (bad luck!!!) Sadly, I wish I hadn't bothered...The animation, special effects and action sequences are, of course, as amazing and impressive as ever, and will certainly bring spark and joy to the average young person (no gender stereotyping!), who will be dazzled by all of that without thinking of anything else. But whilst older, more demanding viewers will still enjoy the in-jokes and references to modern pop culture and social issues, they will be less impressed with a far less engaging or coherent plot than the original, as well as a really obvious villain you can see from a mile off. As many others have noted, there seems to be some really obvious interference from the female empowerment lobby in the proceedings, with Mr Incredible as the 'stay at home dad', while Mrs Incredible is off saving the world like a superhero should throughout, in a reversal of how it's been throughout the years.I'm not sure why this got made, other than as a cheap and easy way to make some cash. Original director Brad Bird has doodooed all over his original masterpiece with this pointless and flat offering, that came out of nowhere like a thief in the night, with no Incredibles to stop it. **",4,3,8,28 August 2018
Sin City," Definitely not Sin Sh!tty
","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Sin City is a dirty little place where a group of disheartened characters go about their downbeat little business. We open with Hartigan (Bruce Willis) a cop nearing 60 with angina problems who nevertheless remains hell-bent on bringing in the abductor, molester and potential killer of a little girl who happens to be the son of a prominent senator. This, however, leads him down a depressing personal path destined to end in disharmony. We then move in on Marv (Mickey Rourke) a go-it-alone tough guy whose downfall will be his need to bring the killers of a hooker he loved to justice. Then there's Dwight (Clive Owen) who wants to protect his new love Shellie (Brittany Murphy) from her ex-lover Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) and his gang and in doing so shatters a truce between the hookers of Sin City, the local cops and the mob. To round off this series of interwoven tales, we go back to Hartigan who has to go on trying to protect the little girl he saved in her childhood in her adult years.Filmed in distinctive film noir style, in terms of presentation at least, Sin City is the first must-see movie of the year. It's also a comic book movie of an entirely different kind. While similar ideas were expressed in the 2003 adaptation of Hulk, this comic-book-on-the-big-screen movie is aimed squairely at the adult market (certainly won't be appearing in no Saturday morning matinée!) with the emphasis on ultra-violence and as much flesh bearing sexual insinuation as you can imagine. In fact, it's one of those movies where at times it seems like the violence is so graphic it's almost parodying the notion of screen violence just as a knowing wink to the audience that it knows what they're all thinking.On the performances front, Willis can play the hard-boiled, edgy cop persona practically in his sleep (though his wise-cracking edge is conspicuously absent here!) with ten years added on his character here, Rourke too does his standard specialty to perfection as the brooding tough-guy and Owen obviously took my King Arthur comment to heart and became a better performer. The best part of it is his fabulous American accent. It's basically just the main cast doing what they've always done, but knowing what they've always done and doing it well.Overall, this is one that those without the blessings of strong stomachs might have trouble enjoying or those with a value that women have come on as more than just sex objects, but it's an impressively told collection of tales with a great cast and a presentation and style that really makes it stand out. ****",9,2,5,24 June 2005
Gangs of New York," A big load of hooh-hah over nothing really
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsMartin Scorsese takes an Oliver Stone esque stab at the American dream/ideology with his latest offering,seeking to shatter anyone's illusions that America was a land built on hope and prosperity with his tale of the war that waged on New York's Five Points area between 1846 and 1863 between the American natives and Irish immigrants,interwining it with the tale of young man Amsterdam Vallon's (Leonardo Di Caprio) quest for vengeance against the leader of the native's Bill 'The Butcher' (Daniel Day Lewis) because he was the one who murdered his father (Liam Neeson).It's directed by Martin Scorsese,it's epic in scope and length,it has an all star cast (including,by the way,Cameron Diaz as a female pick-pocket) and it's the kind of thing the Academy usually lap up anyway.Of course oscars were in the air in the case of Gangs of New York.Personally,though,I couldn't help but feel the movie was trying to send me to sleep,a meandering,lengthy hodge-podge of bland characterization,ineffective characters,disjointed plotting and a script that always seems to be trying too hard.On the plus side,I suppose,there is Day Lewis's engaging performance to bear in mind (he did win the oscar,didn't he?),as well an absorbing feel to the time and place setting.And to be honest,it's got far too much interesting themes and ideas to explore to be completely not worth your time.But,bearing the length in mind,if you manage not to nod off (or switch off,for that matter) before the end,maybe you deserve to win an oscar.***",Null,1,2,18 November 2003

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After foiling an assassination attempt in Mexico, Bond learns that it was to be just the latest in a string of terrorist attacks across the globe, and that it's sparked a major disruption in the chain of the sinister organization behind it. Meanwhile, M (Ralph Fiennes) has become aware that the 00 programme is under threat in the digital age, and has to prove its worth to be kept going. In the middle of all this, Bond travels the world in a bid to foil the evil-doers in their tracks, leading him ever closer to Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), the sinister head of the organization.In recent times, sinister terrorist organizations with global dominance in mind have certainly been dominating the headlines, which lends the latest Bond film a certain dark relevance. Thankfully, the tone and style are appropriately suited to this subject, which is a recommendation in itself. Having enjoyed a lot of success with the last outing, Skyfall, Sam Mendes has seen fit to return this time around, and delivered a film in pretty similar tone.Opening with a genuinely impressive and exciting (if somewhat nauseating) helicopter battle sequence whilst everybody's celebrating down below, it has an impressive opening action sequence that sets the tone for some other great dramatic set pieces to follow, including one on board a train with wrestling legend Dave Bautista. The producers this time round have seen fit to include two Bond girls, including the older but beautiful Monica Belluci, who weirdly goes missing early on, and Lea Seydoux as a psychologist Bond tracks down to the Alps.The downsides are an overly elaborated plot, and a script filled with loads of dialogue weighed down in a lot of meaningless exposition. Plus, while he's okay dramatically, Waltz has too much of a funny/comedy face to be taken that seriously. Still a lot to recommend it, though, and if Craig really has decided to call it a day, this ain't bad to go out on. ***",9,1,4,9 December 2015
Coach Carter," Unoriginal but serviceable and fairly uplifting sports drama
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Ex military man Ken Carter (Samuel L Jackson) now owns a sports store but wants to dedicate his spare time to doing something else- being coach to the basketball team of Richmond High School, whose poor discipline and lack of direction has seen them lose nearly every game in the season. The tough-little-gangsta wannabe boys initially show their usual disrespect and un-cooperativeness to the coach, but they soon learn he will not take the cr*p they're used to giving other coaches before him and step into line a little. Despite their initial dislike, Carter comes to do something no other teacher in the system has done before him- respect the boys and actually push them to achieve in a system that 'is designed for them to fail', but also to show them that that respect has to be earned and that if they abuse it, they will suffer. So when their academic performance fails to improve, he cancels the basketball games for a while. This incurs the wrath of the boys, their parents, other teachers and the community as a whole, but in time, Carter's decision will come to reward the boys and change their lives in ways they never imagined.Coach Carter can hardly be described as original- the story has been done quite a few times before (Dangerous Minds, Mr Holland's Opus- right down to the true story part.) But this doesn't stop it from being any less effective as a film for what it is. It succeeds in being engaging, inspirational and uplifting. Perhaps not the greatest film of it's kind ever, but a pleasing effort certainly.As Carter, the heavily working Jackson assumes a natural command and presence. He is pretty much the driving force of the film, but he couldn't have done it without a solid supporting cast, providing some emotive sub-plots and great depth to the story.It's certainly been produced by MTV alright, as the soundtrack boasts a heap of current popular tracks that anyone over here familiar with the top 40 tracks will know. And it's a great vehicle to appeal to hip younger cinema-goers. ***",7,1,2,7 November 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," Average enough, but a bit mis-sold as a 'feel good' film
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Slumdog Millionaire is not a conventional 'rags to riches' film. That is, to say, it's not a rags to riches story told in a conventional way. It doesn't play out like the sort of heart warming family tale that you could sit down and enjoy your Sunday roast with that the genre is famous for following the convention of. Indeed, it feels a tad mis-sold with the front cover loudly proclaiming it 'a feel good film.' Instead, it unflinchingly takes us feet first into the cold and unfeeling world of the poverty and desperation of the slums of India that are as awful as those in, say, Jamaica. It's strange as India does statistically have a stronger economy than the UK, not to mention being much bigger than us, yet it's still known as 'a poor country.' And Indians do have a reputation as quite affable, gentle people. Yet SM shows us some of the more unsavoury ones who are truly rotten eggs. Which brings us onto another downbeat aspect of the film, in the shape of a truly unsettling scene involving a child being blinded so more pity will be taken on him as a beggar. It takes a nasty jolt like this to wake us up to the true human cost going on behind the poorness and despair, and the parasitic exploitation that festers behind it.Indeed, The News of the World ran the story of how the child stars were made to return to their lives of poverty after the film enjoyed Oscar night and how the father of one of them was even driven to sell them so she could have a better life. There is poverty in the UK, but I can't imagine a situation where a child would be sold out of poverty. All in all, the film serves as a depressing eye opener to the unseen world of India and you come away with less of an impression of having seen a 'feel good' film and indeed actually having seen quite a downbeat and disturbing one. That's not to say it doesn't have it's more positive moments or that it's any less involving, just you go in for one thing and come out with something a bit different.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As World War 2 draws to a close, Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) enlists in the military, much to the disdain of his embittered former vet father (Hugo Weaving.) However, he wishes to serve as a medic, and, owing to his religious principles, refuses to bear arms. Initially, he's dismissed as weak and spineless by his comrades and commanding officers, and is even made to serve some time in jail, but on the outbreak of the Battle of Okinawa, he comes to earn respect and admiration from his former deriders, as he risks his life to ferry injured men over enemy lines and to safety, saving many lives.At a time in his career when he has more credibility behind the camera than in front of it, Mel Gibson has helmed this promising and inspiring tale, that was rich in potential for a big screen dramatisation. Essentially a turning on the head of all the traditional war-time yarns of righteous infliction and gung-ho machismo, this relays a story of incredulous truth, almost in the 'fact is stranger than fiction' league. And, thankfully, it hits all the right notes at just about all the right times.For a wartime film, it spends surprisingly most of the first half focusing on the human drama unfolding at home and later in the army regiment, as Private Doss is tested for his beliefs by his peers and superiors, giving lead star Garfield the chance to display his dramatic range and capability, and he just about manages to carry the film perfectly. In the later stages, the horror and unrelenting impact of the battleground come terrifyingly to light, in a Saving Private Ryan style portrayal that is just as blood soaked and realistic as Spielberg's film.Above all else, Gibson has delivered a searing examination of a different type of courage, measured in individual conviction of beliefs and an unwavering moral devotion to them, the sort that probably wouldn't have been appreciated as much in the days of John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart. ****",9,2,3,4 September 2017
Gladiator," Epic and spectacular.One of the best movies of the year.
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsWatching Gladiator again on video is'nt the same experience as watching it on the big screen,especially my local UGC cinema,which Speilberg himself has personally recommended.There's much more to be savoured here than sound effects and enhanced picture scope,but all the same,the battle scenes in the collesium are of a calibre higher than anything ever seen before.Soaringly brilliant,they set the movie alight.Equally as sweeping is the performances.Richard Harris as the dying,judgemental father is inhabitually rendering,as is Russell Crowe himself as the main star of the show.Joaquin Phoneix as the corrupt second heir to the throne is snidily effective,Derek Jacobi gives a fruitfully vibrant performance as the loudspeaker of the collesium,and Oliver Reed invests a spirited final performance as the beleaguered slave owner.Djimon Hounsou is also unnoticably fine as Crowe's sidekick in the arena.Director Ridley Scott has produced many breathtaking craft designs in his films,but the soaring overview to the entrance of the collesium is one of his most profound and manevolent ever.The whole film works on every level it sets out to work on.Easily one of the most recommendable films of the year,this is best watched on a 32 inch screen in dolby pro logic to create as close a feeling to the cinema as you're ever going to get.*****",Null,0,1,22 November 2000
Donnie Darko," Undeniably weird but not necessarily engaging
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsDonnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a dysfunctional teenager living with his mom,dad and two younger sisters in a suburban town in America.On the night of 2 October 1988,a mysterious force,which later identifies itself as a giant bunny rabbit named Frank,draws him from his house and informs him that in exactly 28 days,6 hours,42 minutes and 12 seconds....the world will end.The next day,Donnie returns to his house and finds that a plane has crashed through the roof and so meeting Frank in turn saved his life.The film then basically follows Donnie through what are destined to be his (and everyone elses) last days and the nefarious activities the rabbit comes to require of him.If ever a film had developed such a strong and unexpected cult following from such humble beginnings over the last few years,it is this one.A small,independent film only ever intended for a limited release,word of mouth must have spread to such an extent that it has now become regarded as one of the most contempory movies of our time.The premise will be regarded by people in equal measure as weird or preposterous or both.The latter is really true of me,and although I couldn't help but notice the film's slant originality in some respects,I simply didn't find it engaging in any way.Gyllenhaal carries the film fairly well and the rest of the cast turn in recommendable turns too.Most of them are no name,but the two that aren't,in the shape of Patrick Swayze (returning from oblivion) as a motivational speaker and Drew Barrymore as an unconventional poetry teacher,are thankless roles that aren't really of any necessity to the already convulted plotline.The bunny's presence has an eerie,unnerving feel (for something so ridiculous) but maybe I'm just a bit too phased for characters like him to have an effect anymore (something to do with psychopathic,demonic clowns,that kind of thing.)Overall,I'm sure the film had some kind of deep,hidden meaning and significance to it,and I'm pretty sure I got it.The film just had no real effect on me.**",Null,7,13,28 February 2004
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The dialogue, acting and writing are all appalling, but, hey, aren't the special effects great?
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Transformers: Dark of the Moon manages the seemingly impossible task of being a film nearly three hours long that manages to move along with a plot so apathetic and piecemeal for that long, without giving the slightest suggestion that it does anything close to engaging you or holding your attention until all the big action starts and everything starts blowing up at the end. Like being told of The Promised Land and having faith until the big pay off comes, it has what can barely described as a 'story' (especially by someone not bowled over by the first two films) that after a hard day I have neither the time nor the inclination to describe.'In the beginning, we were a peaceful race of mechanical beings...' From the off set, the serious attempts at dialogue serve as an indication of the unintentional laughs that are to follow, which are some of the few high points of forcing yourself to slog through this unthinkable third part of the soulless modern day Transformers franchise (but as long as they're making money, right?) Once again the script writers manage to get it all wrong, delivering characters that never come off as real people and dialogue and situations that sound even faker and less likely to happen. I said in my recent Wall Street 2 review that it would be better if Shia LeBeouf was in another Transformers film, well here he is, as bland and lifeless as the last two times, just one of quite a few actors failing to deliver rubies when handed pearls. Respectable, established actors like John Malkovich and Frances McDormand pop up in secondary roles, obviously trying to keep their dignity and not get dragged down with everything else but both really should have known better.In all honesty, I have no right to complain about any of this, as I expected no less, but I had expected good stuff from what the film had been sold on, the special effects and in particular, what some had described as 'the greatest action sequences ever recorded to film' at the end, but even these I found to be under-whelming. Maybe I'd had enough of the relentless onslaught of mediocrity before it, or maybe there's nothing that can impress me any more, but it was the final part of what, like the last two films, had been a complete waste of my time. **",Null,2,6,27 July 2011
The Social Network," Fincher applies his usual dark style to this intriguing and relevant story
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning For such a young guy, I'm still worryingly over-whelmed by all the technology that controls the world these days...you seem to have mobile phones where people can watch films, download music, connect to the internet, music devices that can download tunes on the go, and doing the rounds on the internet itself at the moment, 'social networking' sites seem to be all the rage, mainly Twitter, and, arguably the most popular, Facebook. I fail to see the big rage, to be honest, intermittently informing other users of the most mundane aspects of your day, trying to out compete others with how many messages you can send at one time and so forth. But still, FB has millions of followers worldwide, and has made it's founder Mark Zuckerberg the youngest millionaire on the planet. This film charts how Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, used his social alienation and nerdishness to set him on his way to founding Facebook, before it's money making potential became evident and he began to turn on his friends as he became more ruthless making his way to the top (or so the film claims.) At first glance, the material doesn't feel suited to the dark content director David Fincher is more renowned for and so he's an odd choice to be at the helm here. Still, his heavy, brooding style is felt all over the picture, and adds it a layer of authenticism and style that it otherwise wouldn't have had. In the lead role, Eisenberg (weird his and his character's name both end in berg!) brings the character of Zuckerberg to life quite well, showing an already tactless and socially awkward person descend further into a ruthless, predatory and traitorius monster (although this is a dubious depiction by the film.) It is curious that such a socially challenged guy could be responsible for creating the biggest social networking site in the world. And it has to be said, praise is owed to Justin Timberlake in a supporting role, showing more range and depth than could be reasonably expected of an ex member of N Sync.This is an unusual but timely and relevant piece for a director like Fincher to take on, and, applying his usual cold, dark style, he has achieved quite an admirable result indeed. ****",9,1,1,13 June 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Three's a charm...
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Indy's back in action again, this time on the trail of nothing less than the Holy Grail, which he's been aware of since his father (Sean Connery) seemingly spent more time on the quest for it than him as a boy. He should expect the usual double crossing, mysterious twists and hair-raising adventures as the first two films made him used to.As the most recent (and coincidentally longest) Indy Jones movie, this could well be the one best suited to my times. Unlike it's two predecessors, this one doesn't open in the action and as such has time to develop a more engaging and well planned out story. For the younger audience, it even tries to add on a little morality lesson at the end about resisting the lure of evil and letting go of things we cannot change. Possibly being the most recent, it has probably the most convincing, well filmed action sequences too (well, not quite up to the standards of TTOD perhaps, but still very good...) As for Ford's performance, he's still a rather wooden actor, but because of the extra emotion involved in the story, here he gets a chance to display some more taut scenes which he manages adequately. Because of Connery's stubborn refusal to drop his Scottish accent, he even has to manage one himself at one point and he certainly sounds more Scot than French, which he appears.Coming onto The Last Crusade's home page, I noticed it is in the top 250 and I even noticed a reviewer who said it was the best film in the series. Dare I say it, I agree with him, the one film with the most satisfying combination of a good story with some fine action scenes and certainly fine Bank Holiday Monday entertainment. ****",9,0,0,16 February 2006
Goodfellas," Rightfully hailed as one of the greatest gangster epics of all time
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A film (one I'm sure you're all familiar with) charting the rise of Henry Hill, a young man growing up in a neighbourhood in 1950s New Jersey, who is in awe of the wise guys who lurk in his neighbourhood and the respect and power they command. With low prospects and an abusive father, Henry can see no other way to go than to become one of them and we follow him on his journey as he becomes ingratiated in them, the crimes he carries out for them, his marriage that starts well before going disasterously off the rails, a spell in jail after a job gone wrong and finally where he goes wildly off the rails when he starts taking/dealing drugs and him finally ending up having to testify against his former friends when he becomes a liability to them and they put out a contract on his head, which is still in force today.Robert De Niro. Ray Liotta. Joe Pesci. Three men with faces you wouldn't want to mess with and all perfectly cast in the leading roles in Martin Scorsese's legendary crime epic. All men are on fine form but, in ironically the lesser role, special mention to Pesci who steals the show as the wildly psychotic Tommy.Scorsese's masterpiece was one of the first films to really make use of the camera in new ways, from the long, lingering shot to the still shot, used excellently at various points in the movie. These are usually complimented by a fine 50s soundtrack playing over them, with some real lingering melodies from that era.The story works on two levels, both enlighteningly as an expose of how the gangster world and the gangsters themselves actually have very similar philosophies and worries as normal 9-5 people (with regards to families and staying on top of the competition) as well as showing just why the attraction to that life is so great (hitting home most forcefully at the end when Henry is forced to acknowledge that he'll have to lead the rest of his life like a 'shnuck!') and also engagingly as we watch a man rise from nothing to great heights only to lose it all again through his own bad choices and misguided loyalties. Indeed, as the film spans four decades, we do leave the film feeling as though we've known these characters for years.Coppola's The Godfather will remain the most accomplished crime epic of all time, but Scorsese's effort can never be scoffed at and will rightly remain one of the most well remembered films of it's sort, if you've got the stomach to sit through it in certain parts. *****",10,34,65,12 February 2006
The Bourne Supremacy," For fans of the original. Literally.
","STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Having ceased his services to the CIA, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is now living a life shrouded in secrecy where every stranger's funny glance and every wrong number he receives on the phone is cause for alarm. All he wanted was to be left alone, but a mysterious faction of the CIA still seems intent on hunting him down, in the shape of expert assassin Kirill (Karl Urban) and agency figure-head Pamela Landey (Joan Allen.) Aside from this, he also seems to be suffering from amnesia in the shape of the killings he may or may not have committed for his former employers. When his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente) is killed, the stakes are upped and he becomes more forth-right in his efforts to come out on top.The follow-up to The Bourne Identity hits you straight-on like a bolt from the blue, hitting straight off from where the original left off (which might be a bit bewildering for anyone who never saw the original.) I enjoyed the first movie, I thought it was good, okay, if no great shakes, so I didn't rush out to see the follow-up. Strangely, Damon makes a more credible action hero here, though whether I've just warmed to him I don't know and there's a fairly neat car-chase at the end. But the sheer lack of emotional attachment to the characters, made even worse by all the funny editing and flash-cut scenes going on, makes all that's going on a bit over-whelming.I guess, much like The Lord of the Rings series, you may have enjoyed the films better if you'd read the books first, but I just don't think the Bourne series is translating as well to the screen as other spy thrillers of it's ilk, i.e. the Jack Ryan series or the James Bond novels. With another one on the way, that's a little worrying. **",4,2,4,16 May 2005
Sully," A competent enough, but still flawed biopic
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning On January 15th 2009, airline pilot Chelsey 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) was forced to take drastic action when the passenger airline he was commandeering ran into turbine trouble and began to nosedive down towards New York. Sully took evasive action, and glided the plane down toward the Hudson river, saving the lives of all the passengers on board. However, in the aftermath, his airline tried to hang him out to dry in order to avert blame for the disaster from themselves, and he and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were forced to do a round of publicity to defend themselves.Nothing produces better human drama than a real life drama, and plenty of them occur every day for Hollywood to bang out for the big screen (what with this and, for example, the up-coming Patriot's Day with Mark Wahlberg.) Clint Eastwood's latest dramatization has a really glossy, ready made feel to it, another Malpaso company production with none other than Tom Hanks in the lead role. Running at a far more condensed length of just over an hour and a half (rather than the two hours or so it would have ten/twenty years ago), it zips by and is a generally fine and polished piece, but sadly it's undeniably pretty flawed.I didn't know much about this event, but in early 2009 it must have been something that took America by storm, and with 9/11 still fresh in everyone's minds, it undoubtedly must have caused some fear and panic. It was a tale that was indeed begging to be told, but sadly Eastwood's execution is a little disjointed, and the dramatization and the flashbacks to what happened are too blurred together to enjoy the story properly, whilst other strands, such as a scene where Sully's fascination with flying began as a child, is never explored any further. It's never sensationalist or sentimental, but it's still a bit flawed as a film.Performances wise, in the lead, this is a role Hanks was pretty much born to play, and a role he can pretty much do in his sleep, portraying a reserved, dignified man whilst also quietly conveying his softer side in some private, emotional scenes. His presence adds to the overall smooth, glossed over feel to the film, though, while Eckahrt provides similar sturdy support along with Laura Linney as Sully's wife. It's an aesthetically pleasing film that is just a little too flawed to be perfect. ***",7,0,1,22 December 2016
Cinderella Man," A brilliantly competent drama
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The scene is New York, 1930s. The Wall Street Crash has taken a devastating toll on the people of the Big Apple and the great depression is in full swing, with many of the population living below the poverty line. One of those people is former champion fighter James J Braddock (Russell Crowe), his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their two children. Braddock's career slumped years ago, and now he's getting by with the occasional work at a docking yard and even living off Relief Aid. But he becomes determined to regain his self esteem, get himself in shape and re-train to once again become the people's champion, this time managing to lift the spirits of the nation as well as reclaiming his honour as one of the greatest boxing heroes ever.There's just too many films released these days, and no matter what sort of great reviews or cult acclaim they get, I just don't get enough time to see them all and am most likely only to be guaranteed to see the big name, box office hits. Cinderella Man was one of those films that just went right over my head when it first came out, and I've only got round to seeing on the off chance now. I'm quite glad I did, though, because although it's not overly memorable or inspiring, it is a very rewarding and absorbing film to sit down and watch. The main star and the director may have been one reason why I never rushed out to see it, as they're the same team behind, IMHO, the slightly over-rated (especially in light of 2001's other Oscar nominated heavy-weight Training Day!) A Beautiful Mind but messrs Crowe and Ron Howard have pulled this film off with considerable aplomb. None of the performances are particularly brilliant, but Crowe, Zellweger and a supporting cast including Paul Giamatti and some recognizable bit part actors manage to keep things moving engagingly enough and then some.So then we are left with a film that didn't make a huge impact at the box office and was shadowed over by some (even with it's Oscar nominations) but is beyond watchable nonetheless. The story of the under dog rising to the top through boxing has been done before in films like Rocky and it doesn't do anything particularly surprising or exceptional, but it's a believable, well made and fairly well acted tale that is well worth seeing. ****",9,0,2,22 December 2006
Valkyrie," Above average wartime thriller
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In 1944, Col. Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), Maj. Tresckow (Kenneth Brannagh) and generals Olbricht (Bill Nighy) and Fromm (Tom Wilkinson) plotted to kill Hitler and overthrow his SS army by initiating his 'valkyrie' defence league and get them all to wipe each other out. Needless to say, things don't run entirely to plan.Big name star Cruise is here sharing a platform with a host of British thespians including Branagh, Nighy, Wilkinson, Terence Stamp and Eddie Izzard, all curiously keeping their English accents despite playing soldiers in the German High Command. The human angle of the story seems to be trying to show how some members of the Nazi Party, even those high up in the chain of command, found some of Hitler's acts unacceptable and wanted to show the world they weren't all compassionless freaks. That's just a sideline, though, and the main angle is the thriller aspect, and this is executed with enough tension, suspense, style and flair to keep things running nicely. No one's delivering the performances of their career, but the all star cast list are a lively sort and keep things flowing along nicely enough.Interesting, exciting, thrilling and competent, it's not quite good enough to win any awards but it's top notch Sunday night entertainment all the same. ***",7,1,2,15 September 2009
The Simpsons Movie," It finally came...but sadly just went
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After a concert at Springfield Lake where the band Green Day nearly drowned due to the pollution there, Lisa starts campaigning to save the local environment and in so doing crosses paths with a charming young Irish boy who she falls in love with. Meanwhile Bart's once again growing resentful of Homer's bad parenting skills and when he starts to show more attention to a pig he rescued from Krusty Burger he turns to next door neighbour Ned for guidance.It's this pig that kicks the main part of the plot off, as Homer selfishly dumps a silo he's been using to store it's waste in SL, and causes a major environmental catastrophe. This causes the EPA to drop a massive dome around Springfield and when the townspeople find out it's Homer's fault, they all turn out to lynch him. the family manage to escape to Alaska, but Homer's selfishness drives everyone away once again and, realizing he stands to lose everything that matters to him, Homer hot foots it back to Springfield to sort out the mess he created and patch things up with his loved ones.When The Simpsons first appeared as a tiny sketch show on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, it was hard to imagine that twenty years later it would be the most successful cartoon and lasting cartoon shows ever (more so than the Bugs Bunny cartoons from Warner Brothers in the 1950s) and finally a movie's been made about it. I really got it into my head that tonnes of praise would be heaped upon it, with five star reviews coming left and right. But most critics simply lamented how average the movie turned out to be, struggling to give it any more than about three stars. And I'm afraid, speaking as a long time fan of the show, I can kind of see their point.It's been ten years in the making and it's testament to how difficult it's been to make that it wasn't out by the time the show was at the height of it's success in the 90s. But one episode takes six months to make, so a film was always going to be tricky, no matter how great the demand for it. But, unfortunately, that may be a big part of the problem. The show's still very popular, but not as much as the time when it was really cutting edge (especially for a cartoon series) and not afraid to poke fun at sensitive subjects in the news and around the world at the time. The movie plays it too safe, keeping the clever gags down to taking pot shots at well known films, including Titanic, An Inconvenient Truth, Independence Day, Night of the Living Dead and disaster films from the 70s, as well as celebrity cameos from the likes of Green Day, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Hanks. The plot struggles to endure the 80 minute running time, without a solid narrative flow and a bit incoherent. The cracks start to show quite early on as you notice what works well for half an hour can't quite translate to a feature length film.Having been a dedicated and loyal fan of the show for over ten years now, finally seeing The Simpsons Movie is something I can only compare to finally having sex, really. Something I really built myself up for only to be left, to be honest, a bit disappointed. ***",7,2,2,6 September 2007

The Martian," A unique, visually styled film that's still not the sum of its parts
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning During an outer space mission around Mars, astronaut Matt Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft, and is presumed dead in the immediate aftermath. Stranded many light years from his home planet, Mark is forced to use his survival training (including fertilising faeces for food!) in order to survive, before managing to contact Earth and bring news of his survival to NASA president Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), who desperately works on Earth with scientist Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to get him home, while re-assuring a frantic public.Having made his name in a landmark sci-fi classic many decades ago, Ridley Scott returns to the genre for a film where the only alien appears to be in human form. His ability to create an impressive visual spectacle doesn't seem to have diminished with time, and The Martian features some sets and designs in outer space that could quite blow your mind. The director oversteps any meaningful character development, and plunges us straight into a story that serves as a lengthier rendition of 2013's Gravity, with elements of Tom Hanks's Cast Away chucked in for good measure.For a film stretching at nearly two and a half hours, it really needed not just an interesting story, but an effective screenplay to match it. While the 'one man stranded in space' plot still has some life in it, Scott seems overly preoccupied with stuffing Damon's Watson character full of insightful technical jargon and waffle, to reassure us he's highly intelligent and 'NASA's finest', to the point of disconnection. To try and balance the script with some humour, Scott has displayed an affection for '70s disco music, which Damon must awkwardly eschew. It's a welcome touch, if not truly effective.Performances wise, Damon must carry the lengthy film almost singlehandedly, and it's his varying degrees as an actor that make as little or most of this. While a better actor could have made more of it, by turns a weaker actor could have made it worse, and so you're grateful for small mercies. In what could be the main supporting role, Daniels is grounded as the head of NASA but, in a film determined to have as much humour as drama, that role he took with Jim Carrey all those years ago (and recently reprised) can never get out your mind. A further colourful supporting cast further make it up, including Michael Pena, Sean Bean and Ejiofor.Overall, it's not an entirely unsuccessful film, just one without the genuine tension and suspense to really make it last as long as it does, and so the cracks do appear at times. ***",7,8,11,4 July 2016
The Fighter," Hardly anything ground breaking or original but well made and solid enough to cover this up
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the seventies, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) was riding high as a boxing sensation, but two decades later, he's succumbed to a crippling crack addiction and gets by committing petty crimes to fund his habit. All the attention's now turned to his younger brother Micky (Mark Whalberg), the new 'great white hope.' Micky has a natural talent and ability, which could take him very far, if all the things and people around him don't conspire to stop him reaching his goals.The boxer is a familiar figure to feature in stories of the 'underdog' who triumpths against all odds. The appeal of these movies is their relatability, since there are far more lost souls not reaching their full potential out there in this world than there are real success stories, and this character, with little else to get by on other than their raw toughness, resilience and determination to be 'the best', seems to embody this description really well. Often coming from poor, deprived backgrounds, with trashy friends and family toughened by the same rough social conditions as them who, while some might mean well, all the same conspire in some way without even realizing it, to hold them down and keep them there with them, this figure often faces tough adversity in their journey to rise themselves out from the gutter and will doubtless run into moments of self doubt and enraged frustration along the way. But, in a rough and cynical world, in the end their hard work pays off and one moment of brief, fleeting but over whelming luck runs their way and they (and the audience) feel that bit better. Basically, The Fighter follows this formula to a tee, but while it's most obviously a Rocky clone, it has elements of that film but also of that other most famous of the boxing movies, Robert De Niro's Raging Bull, with it being partly told in flashback with the two main characters talking into a camera at the beginning and end, re-living past glories and prepping each other up.While it's ultimately a very predictable story, David O' Russell's film is never sentimental or corny, or without it's little flairs that make it stand out on it's own, most notably Bale's wild, quirky older brother character, whose pathetic addiction and increasingly pitiful existence never manages to erode his natural charisma and easy charm with people. Whalberg doesn't particularly stretch himself in the lead role, but his natural monosyllabic drone and drawl fit him to the role perfectly and mean he can pull it off with ease. Mention should also go to Amy Adams, as feisty, upfront love interest Charlene, another product of the rough, trashy environment all of the characters are caught up in. This type of film is the sort the Academy and critics always lap up, and while it's not in any way ground breaking or original enough to be anything more than okay, it's well made and solid enough to be nowhere near average. ***",7,0,0,30 June 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," A collosal failure and wasted opportunity
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Action is a genre in desperate need of some young blood. In a day and age where a 62 year old Sylvester Stallone (not looking a day of it!) can be a box office sell out with a fourth Rambo film, it just goes to show how much they're relying on the old stars to draw in the crowds. There have been some more modern stars with potential, such as Vin Diesel and The Rock, but they've never been given a script that really struck fans. The same could be said of muscly Glaswegian lead Gerard Butler, who's been in recent films such as the joyless, soulless Gamer and poor man's Gladiator 300. And this latest disappointment makes nothing any better.Law Abiding Citizen had the potential to be a really tough, raw action thriller and in some ways it sort of does. The plot's the familiar, formulaic sort involving a man who's family are murdered right in front of him, only to see justice fail him and for him to return ten years later with vengeance on his mind. But after his first encounter with his first thug, where he pretends to be a sleeping cop, the film's credibility goes completely out the window and it turns into a ridiculous, far fetched fantastical sort of tale that goes completely against the raw, realistic revenge film it was advertised as. Since the plot's very similar to The Punisher, you see how that film worked because of the fantasy/comic book theme to it and it's outlandishness wasn't a problem but here it completely eviscerates the tone. Further implausibilities and inconsistencies keep popping up throughout the film and before long it's all gotten too much. The fact that it all ends up being quite predictable doesn't help, either.The opening sequence has gained some tongues wagging for how nasty and shocking it is, and while it's certainly not nice, the film really picks up it's mean spirited side more towards the end, by which time it's gotten even more silly and unbelievable, and boredom has inevitably set in. F Gary Gray most notably directed the distracting but unremarkable hostage thriller The Negotiator but that's a masterpiece to sit through compared to this, a dark revenge tale that had the potential to really get under your skin but ends up getting under your nerves. *",2,12,21,5 December 2009
V for Vendetta," Interesting concept, but forgets it's supposed to be an action film
","STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh Set in a futuristic London, with a conservative freak named Adam Sutler (John Hurt) as the ruler and an oppressive, totalitarian regime in place that denies people freedom of speech, religion and love. Modelling himself against that other hero against oppression Guy Fawkes, a masked figure named V (Hugo Weaving) saves a woman from being raped by two corrupt policemen before bombing two famous London landmarks in an act of rebellion against the oppressors. He then high jacks a TV station and broadcasts a message to the people of London urging them to join him and rise up against the forces of oppression. Unfortunately in making his escape, the woman he rescued the night before, reporter Evey (Natalie Portman) he is forced to kidnap and hold against her will. But in doing so, he is able to open her eyes to the truth before midnight strikes and he rounds off his campaign of terror?/freedom fighting with one big act that will shake the very foundation of the present society.I have never read the novel this film is based on, but I can only hope that if I ever do, it makes for more satisfying entertainment than this misguided action film. It's unfortunate the film doesn't work in the end, because V is certainly a very interesting and compelling hero/anti-hero, fighting for the causes of what he sees as good by using methods that might be employed by terrorists fighting for evil, cleverly used as a metaphor of Guy Fawkes rising against the tyranny of James I, well written and engagingly played by Hugo Weaving. In our modern age of September 11 and July 7, it's very daring for the film-makers to portray such a character and not attract a lot of backlash against such a film.Unfortunately, in concentrating so much on making VFV a massive political statement about the folly of tyranny and oppression, the film seems to forget it's meant to be an action film and becomes a lot of talk and banter, with little in the way of exciting, juicy action on display. Stretching at over two hours, this makes it quite a long haul to sit through and while the sermonizing and twisty/turny story can't be ignored, it's just not what you payed for. **",4,0,8,9 August 2006
The Island," A soulless and insincere excuse for Michael Bay to make lots of things go crash and bang
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A group of women and men exist in this world that is actually an abandoned underground military bunker. Every so often one of their number wins 'the lottery' and is selected to go to 'the island' for a seemingly better existence. But there's a problem. One of their number, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) has become curious and started questioning their reason for being. So when Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) 'wins', they spring an escape- only to find the island security hot on their trail. It is on their escape that they learn of the shocking truth for their being and the deadly implications it now has.I know I've got problems with a movie when it's been on for, what, fifteen minutes and already the plot just hasn't grabbed me- and that was definitely the case with The Island. The plot opens and it's really just a case of how? what? and who?, because it's all opened with the subtlety of a sledge hammer and you're not sure of who anyone is and what they're meant to be doing. All you see is a bunch of people wondering around in white suits like they've lost the top of their costumes and have wondered off the set of a Durex commercial. You really get the impression that Bay didn't care about the plot and just wanted to dream up any old hash to make a movie that would rake in big bucks for the summer. With a story this uninteresting, it's little wonder that the film's length (130 minutes) becomes a little too much and it all feels a bit too long.At it's most intelligent, the story seems to be having a stab at consumerism and how in the future corporations will be able to sponsor anything- but it came far too late in the plot to make me care about the it any more, there's plausibility issues with it anyway and it seems to be owing to past such films like Blade Runner in some ways.Performances wise, McGregor does a good American accent, but even his usually charismatic presence can't save this. As his co-star, Scarlett Johansson looks pretty but doesn't make much more of an impression. The supporting players are pretty useless. Steve Buscemi shows up and just does his usual edgy, guy trying to rationalize everything act he's been doing since Reservoir Dogs, as does Sean Bean as the no-nonsense bad guy. Djimon Hounsou is just.....Djimon Hounsou.With all this wrong with it, you count on the action scenes to save the film, but even they fail to make an impression, shot too closely and with too much of a grey camera shot. Liked by few, The Island certainly seems to be a blockbuster 2005 would rather you didn't remember. **",4,2,4,15 January 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Oddball latest addition from the Coens
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsThe ever prominent Coens return to the screen with O Brother,Where Art Thou?,an oddball but perversely entertaining experience which leaves you with a diverse sense of a pleasantly twisted imagination.Set in Mississipi in the late 1930's,it follows the trials and tribulations of a trio of escaped convicts who have the potential to make it big as a band of singers,with the assistance of a racially harassed coloured guitar player.It's the weird elements of the film that make it so memorable ,there are many interludes involving angels singing in lakes,and members of the Klu Klux Klan doing bizzaire dance rituals that stick in the mind long after.And George Clooney,John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson can sing so surprisingly well.Well worth seeing.***",Null,0,0,21 April 2001
The Godfather," Truly masterly film-making, right up there with Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia and Schindler's List
","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.) What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****",10,8,15,13 May 2005
