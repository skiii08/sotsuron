It," Pretty disappointed
",Huge huge fan of Steven Kings books especially It - this just doesn't work. The original worked way better. Penny-Wise just seemed too real! And I'm your face. I wasn't freaked out by him in the same way I was in the original.,4,0,3,11 April 2019
Captain Marvel," Larson cannot run
",I just can't understand why the critics gave this film anything! Jude Law and his gang are the only good thing about it and you'd think they would find a star who could run. Brie Larson looks like she had to go to athletic school for a crash course but didn't make it past the first jog!,2,89,160,3 April 2019
