Marie Antoinette," Loved it!
","Nobody could have played the part better than Kirsten Dunst especially with Sophia behind the camera. It might be one of my favorite roles she has done. It's a beautiful but tragic story that seems to be completely unlike society today but only in the fashion sense. The parallel's of how people spent their time in 1700 France and how people spend their time today astounds me. For as little dialog there is in this movie, It says a lot. It broke my heart when they took her dog away (that's just mean!)and I would have liked to have seen more of the Count!!PS - Jason Schwartzman was genius as Loius Auguste.",9,1,4,23 October 2006
