Resident Evil: Afterlife," The Afterlife Begins With a Bang
","I recently got a chance to watch Resident Evil: Afterlife with a couple of friends at a local theatre. The first three movies didn't give me that much to expect for the fourth installment, either way, I was very excited. I came out completely blown away. It was high octane thrilling action at its best.Some movies (e.g. Airbender) used the magic of 3D to great waste. But to tell you, Resident Evil 4 was absolutely amazing in 3D and surround sound. Never before had I got to witness Milla Jovovich blowing zombies away in 3D. It was a whole new experience and the first of its genre to be in 3D. I thought it was used amazingly.There were many jump scares which I didn't mind, the 4 mouthed zombie's looked awesome and the normal zombie's look also very freaky in 3D as well as the Axeman whose feet shaked the very floor of the theater. But the best scene for me was definitely the final battle with Wesker, complete with suspenseful rock music accompanied in which accompanied the epic battle. We've been waiting for almost 3 movies to see his head blown out into bits by Jovovich. I'll leave you to see yourself if he makes it out alive.Overall it was a great movie, not for kids, so do yourself a wonderful favour, run to your local theater and buy yourself a ticket for Resident Evil: Afterlife in 3D.P.S. Stay a few minutes into the credits. Video game fans wont be disappointed",8,26,54,10 September 2010
Shrek Forever After," Not Exactly Magical, But A Good Finale
","I've Recently watched Shrek 4 with my family over the weekend and I thought it was pretty entertaining. Sure the jokes were Clich√©d and the plot was a bit unoriginal, sure its not better than the first two. Although its definitely better than the third. But I still had fun watching it and laughed out loud the whole way.The Last Scene was a bit disappointing, I thought we would see another Puss and Donkey Sequence just like Shrek 1,2,3 but I was disappointed by the lack of magic the final scene had, its supposed to be the final scene where you see Shrek and friends for the last time. Cmon they can do better than that.Overall I thought it was great fun, although not as good as the first two, It was still great fun, I laughed a lot, I had a great time. Thanks for the good times Shrek",7,4,6,7 July 2010
Alice in Wonderland," a fantasy adventure for the whole family
","i was able to catch Alice in wonderland last night and to tell you i went in not really expecting anything since i'm not a big fan of Tim Burton. but sure did this movie prove me wrong. i thought it was great, fun and the imagination of Tim Burton was wonderful. if i saw this before avatar i would've loved the CGI. i thought johnny depp was great. he really brought the mad hatter to life. Helena, a good villain as usual. crispin glover, great as usual. but as for our girl Mia wasikowska she didn't have much emotion or depth in the role and we didn't get to discover much of her character. but overall it was a fantastic movie pivoted by johnny depp's mad hatter. if they chose a different actor i don't think the movie would be as good. its great family fun but yes, there are some disturbing moments in the movie, well in a Tim Burton movie it must've at least one or two. but the kids wont mind. once again, an adventure for the whole family. so sit back, enjoy the ride that is wonderland",8,3,10,5 March 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," DOTM Is Certainly Not Perfect But The Best Of Its Franchise
","I would like to start off by saying That Transformers Dark Of The Moon is far from a perfect movie nor an Oscar winning picture, but its a great summer flick that entertains the audience with Eye popping 3D and state of the art Visual effects that doesn't fail to deliver. DOTM, unlike its predecessor is a more intense and emotional movie and is obviously shown in the seriousness of war and the loss of lovable characters. Although DOTM does have its disadvantages, as well as plot holes and a scrappy, rushed ending that wasn't done right. The conclusion of the film left me thinking it was the end of an episode from the TV show and certainly not a farewell film for Michael Bay and Shia LaBeouf, who are both leaving the franchise. The ending scene really really bothered me and I'm sure it bothered several others who thought the Transformers franchise deserved a proper farewell (for the time being) not just a quick, abrupt, narrated and almost rushed and heartless ending. The end scene just featured Optimus Prime narrating his epic 'speeches' before the scene, not only quickly cuts to the Earth's atmosphere but also Michael Bay's name as well as Linkin Park's great 'Iridescent'. The movie deserved a proper ending scene, judging that it has come so far (1,2,3). The movie itself was done so well it was ruined by a poorly executed end scenario. Sure there are some plot holes, not major ones and certainly the element of surprise when Ken Jeong made a funny, yet ironic performance as Wang as well as the sudden appearances of Barricade, of whom we haven't seen in action since cowering away from the fight in the first Transformers. The plot holes are obvious and its always made in the Transformers films as in this movie sudden disappearances of the Doc Bot and the decepticon hatchlings were subject to Bay's 'carelessness' as well as some really corny scenes for example when Carly went to give Megatron a 'pep talk'.The acting wasn't great, but neither was it bad. I thought Rosie Huntington Whiteley did the best she could, though it isn't great cut her some slack, she's a model. Not an actress. Shia did brilliant as Sam Witwicky once more, with his usual role a 'damsel' in distress crying for help from his Autobot friends. Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving etc. did their characters justice once more and Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Frances McDormand, John Turturro, Patrick Dempsey and John Malcovich where also solid as well as the rest of the supporting cast in the film.The 3D was brilliant, nowadays 3D is a regular thing and its as if it is a routine to go into a film with ridiculous looking glasses on and watch a movie, sometimes to no avail. But Transformers DOTM sure hit the money with the 3D. At some points it felt almost realistic. I urge everyone to see this picture in an IMAX theater or the best theater possible to get the maximum experience from this flick. I would love another Transformers with not necessarily new characters but a more diverse Transformers universe with additions like Hot Rod, Ultra Magnus and Galvatron with god-like Transformers like Unicron and Primus.DOTM still has some corny jokes in there, some points unnecessary but at some points its just for laughs. The action sequences were there with great choreography and amazing 'Transforming' from car to Robot. Surprisingly enough there was also some emotional scenes that were at the verge of heart breaking such as the scene Bumblebee seems to have given up his will to live as well as the tragic and sudden death of Ironhide. But the movie can't help but feel rushed. Starscreams death was at the verge of pathetic and Megatron's totally abrupt, as if portraying the two main antagonists from the first two films as weak. Shockwave has limited to almost no screen time. He gets a line or two and at some points hes a definite bad-ass but don't let the posters fool you. Shockwave (spoilers) isn't the main villain in this film, the betrayal of Sentinel Prime came as a complete shocker for me and perhaps the whole theater and in the end got what he deserved. The 'Megan Fox' issue didn't bother me at all. I actually enjoyed the movie more without her. In the end Transformers Dark of the Moon is a wonderful movie to watch with some friends at the cinemas. Its a great experience to just sitback, wear 3D glasses and enjoy the action of Transformers 3 as well as its ridiculously epic score and repetitive playing of Linkin Park's 'Iridescent' to full effect. A great thrilling ride despite its flaws.",7,3,7,30 June 2011
