Ali," Ali, his life and the history of racism in America
","I disagree with the previous comments.  Ali is a powerful biography that puts his life into an historical context.  Through the story of his life we learn about the history of racism in America; from the civil rights movement to Malcolm X and the growth of the Black Muslim Movement.  He is shown to be a quiet force in the evolving politics.Will Smith, even bulked up, is no heavyweight!  When they put him on the scale and said 218, we laughed; otherwise he did a very credible job.  I watched the film with several teenagers who knew little about Mohammed Ali and I was impressed how they 'got it'.  They were Will Smith fans going in and came out talking and asking questions about Ali and the sixties.",8,0,0,2 January 2002
