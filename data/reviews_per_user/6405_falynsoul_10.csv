Iron Man 3," Entertaining, but too much too fast. Weak ending ruined the experience as a whole for me.
","I really enjoyed the first half of this film. It played well to Tony S's personality, ambition, and overall troubled state of mind coming off the near-disaster of New York city being vaporized. Perhaps that near-death experience gave him some PTSD there!The villains seemed rather undeveloped-- thrown in like cheap marketing tricks to give the film some much needed fodder for Tony's suits to blow up. The flying suits were a bit overplayed, and seemed to fall apart WAY TOO EASILY. After the first five times, it seemed like they were held together by mere plastic connectors. They could have slowly introduced us to the concept of the suit being able to dissesemble-- it was too much too fast and used too heavily as a plot device to save the day.Ah the ending. I had a total WTF moment the second TS decided to blow up the suits. What on earth would trigger such a thought? He had nearly been killed, had his home destroyed-- why scrap the very devices that he had built his legacy on? And really? Getting surgery to have that shrapnel removed? THAT IS JUST PLAIN RIDICULOUS. Anyone in their right mind would have gotten it removed as soon as they got to a hospital! Also 'getting Pepper fixed' was a real cheap move, taking the emotion buildup straight out of the ending. What a disappointing way to go out-- on this film, not to mention the not so subtle James Bond reference. The ending scene after the credits was cheap also, and not worth waiting for. A fun but ultimately disappointing experience. Five out of ten. Go see a manatee showing.",5,1,2,5 May 2013
The Maze Runner," I had such high hopes after being blown away by the books. Boy, was I wrong.
","This film is not the Maze Runner. It has the same title, but it is not the same story. Major plot lines and devices are completely changed/and/or missing completely. Entire sections of the story are taken out of context and mutated to fit into the film's limited run-time.Its a shame because the book (trilogy) is one of the most intense and engrossing experiences I've had in the dystopian genre. I listened to the audiobooks at work over the course of a week-- the hours just flew by and I nearly forgot I was working!I couldn't believe the amount of cheap CGI sellout here. They could have at least kept some of the defining details about the maze, Thomas, and Teresa faithful to the books. But no, it was absolutely pathetic. If you don't care to read the books this is probably a 6.5-7 for you.",3,33,64,19 September 2014
Passengers," A beautiful film that got snubbed by politically correct critics.
","--SPOILER FREE--The 'critics' are completely off their rockers here and like other audience reviewers have stated-- if the genders were reversed the guy would have been considered LUCKY. Beyond lucky if modern culture is to be taken seriously-- which is always right and never wrong about anything. *SARCASM* for the uninitiated morons who can't understand humour. Get triggered somewhere else!I had to get that bit out of the way first because this film is an absolutely fantastic watch. Its balanced, takes its time, sets up the characters smoothly, and doesn't jump around to different locations at whim like so many films are doing now.Speaking of characters there really aren't that many-- and I think it works in the film's advantage. There never is a sense of confusion or the plot tripping over itself trying to stay relevant. Martin Sheen's role is one of comic relief and suave android bartender (not a spoiler, watch the trailer). Loved nearly every second of his screen time. The rest of the roles are obvious-- although I must say Chris Pratt absolutely carries this film and delivers an emotional depth that a lot of A-listers aren't these days. He is truly the next Harrison Ford or Christian Bale. Jennifer is... well... Jennifer. She does her thing, which isn't terrible but I didn't find it particularly inspired. I think the correct word is 'serviceable'. The visual design is nothing short of post-modern perfection. Sprawling smooth metal textured silver vistas leading to glass windows blanket the ship's interior, giving a view into the beautiful blue hued nebulae of space. The artistic vision of space is not realistic but it certainly is authentic and fantastic to look at-- it doesn't require a suspension of belief to enjoy it unlike many recent space films.The sound design throughout the film is also excellent. The music throughout is incredibly moving and well composed. Not on the level of Hanz Zimmer but still great.There are a few technical issues that might stick out to the more scientifically minded but it never disrupts the flow or enjoyment of the film in my opinion. It all simply works.If you're a sci-fi fantasy fan or just want to escape for a couple hours please support this film-- we need more like it. The critics need to step back and re-evaluate audience responses. They've lost touch.",8,14,26,27 December 2016
Suicide Squad," Enjoyable but has some notable flaws.
","I'm honestly not sure how I'm supposed to feel about this movie. There are a lot of 'huh' moments and 'why the f*** would they do that'. It seems as if DC wanted us to root for the SS and the villains rather than the 'good guys'. Overall I'd say this is a mixed bag and your priorities when going to see the film will determine whether you enjoy yourself or not. Pros: Deadshot and Harley Quinn back-stories, overall performances from the cast. Interactions between the characters was great and resulted in some hilarious moments. Villains were pretty decent.Cons: Cheap looking CGI, some jokes fell through, some corny dialogue. Some characters were sidelined and really underused. Soundtrack got in the way of some scenes-- too loud.I feel like a broken record saying this again, but I just feel confused. Its a super-mixed bag. What was the point of making this movie only to undermine it later on... ( when you see the end credits you will know what I'm talking about )",4,0,1,6 August 2016
Interstellar," Leave some 'space' in your schedule to see this!
","My first favorite film... never had one before!Obviously a few sentences can't do this film justice; its a true diamond in the manure pit of remakes that Hollywood just keeps pumping out.Its a compelling story if you're into sci-fi and space exploration. If you're a fanatic-- then this is wet dream. The film is even more beautiful than the trailer-- unlike many recent releases!The emotional impact took me by surprise. The emotional range of so many films today is so low its almost like trying to discern a symphony through a tin can. Not so here. I FELT the excitement, grief, anger, of each character quite starkly. The film wraps up beautifully-- no spoilers here. Just want to let you know that I found it very satisfying.If you go see this in true 70mm IMAX you're going to be in for a treat. Some of the most stunning space sequences are in full IMAX resolution, and it is possibly the most immersive experience available to date.",9,5,13,18 November 2014
Divergent," Decent, for what its worth... ignore the haters.
","I think this franchise would be better served by being treated to a full budget HBO production 10-13 episode run. The world the books create is highly detailed, gritty, and chock full of emotional depth and events that are just not possible to represent well in a 2-3 hour film.That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film for what it did offer. The mental pictures I developed through reading the books were eerily similar to the ones in the movie. I tend to favor a movie's art style and atmosphere over acting/character development so I may be biased here. The post-apoc world was tastefully done, and didn't go overboard with blue glowing screens and lighting. The overall color tone is well balanced and natural, something that cannot be said for a lot of films that tend to feature over-saturated skies and light sources.Acting seemed solid to me. I tend to miss certain cues from the book, so if a character was acting differently than in the book, I probably didn't notice. The movie won't shock you or make you cry, but it did make me feel exhilarated at certain points. It was nice to not have unnecessary sex scenes for once. I'm not against sex in film at all, don't get me wrong. I just think the romance was done tastefully done.Overall, a solid release. (no pun intended)",7,4,15,22 March 2014
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A ton of stupid fun
","I seriously enjoyed this film-- it had more gore than Mel Gibson could shake a fist at, some very cute actors, and didn't waste time with excessive back-story and details, and gave me many good laughs.Its not an intellectually stimulating movie... duh. Its made to a hilariously entertaining popcorn flick with over-the-top action and unrealistic weapons that wouldn't have existed given the 'time period' this movie seems to be set in. So you folks out there giving it bad rap for not meeting your standards, calm down. Its clearly not trying to. :).This movie's violence reminded me of the Expendables-- but this film never takes itself too seriously like the other film does... I found this much more fun to watch.",8,193,245,5 February 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Thrilling, Immersive, Delightful.
","Technical Execution Words really don't do this film justice when seen in high resolution IMAX format in 3D. The high frame rate, from my perspective, was an incredibly positive aspect to the film. I felt as if I was really there, experiencing everything the characters were feeling. I found myself instinctively dodging rocks, feeling a genuine sense of terror at the Hobbit's few scary moments. I can understand that it might not be for everyone, and that's fine. I'm sure it will rock any screen it graces. That's my nutshell impression of the film's technical side.Acting/Storyline/Plot The acting of most recent films has been disappointing, to say the least. This a refreshing return to films that thrill and really make you feel 'at home' with the characters. Peter Jackson has created a fantastical world of danger and fantasy where the actors are free to act out their characters-- they are some lucky folks! I felt a keen sense of connection with the Dwarfs' plight, the desire to return and take back their home. Many people are saying the 'intro' was too long. What intro? Huh? The whole 'beginning' section of the movie is necessary to create that emotional connection that really gives the film a weighty feel. I left the theater feeling alive and happy.Other thoughts. I walked into the theater with very high expectations-- and a bit skeptical that the film would deliver. It surpassed everything I had hoped for and more. Don't listen to the critics this time. Don't waste your time on the reviews. Just go see it!",10,4,13,14 December 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Excellent film for what it offers: engaging action and emotional scenes
","I thought the movie was very emotionally engaging on many levels. It employed a very high sense of non-verbal communication. As other reviews have said, it lacks depth in dialogue, but is a minuscule flaw compared to its strengths. The quality of the animation is without a doubt, on the level of Avatar. Very realistic. Definitely worth a watch at your local theater. The ending is predictable, however, but not bad. If you're a fan of watching chips climb impossibly fast over the Golden Gate Bridge, then you'll love the ending.It was nice to see David Hewlett in this film, albeit only briefly. He played the paranoid neighbor quite well.",Null,1,5,6 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Battlefront: The Movie
","Don't worry-- no spoilers here. If you've never seen any Star Wars films, never read any of the expanded universe, or simply are looking for a fun evening I think you'll have a great time. However...Disney unceremoniously shafted the EU fans with this movie. The EU was rich in material to choose from-- Grand Admiral Thrawn, Centerpoint Station, Jacen Solo, the Yuuzhan Vong war, need I go on?Okay okay you say, so what? Is the new material any good? If you enjoy a helping of bland Lima beans with your week old milk that tastes like it came from a bantha's backside, then sure, its great! Sure they bring in our favorite characters to crack jokes and it made me laugh. But the sum total of this film is this: Too much talk, cringe worthy acting, and a boring *** story that makes no **** ******* ***** sense! The *other* characters were so disposable; I didn't even care about them. Grab a cheap afternoon ticket, cancel your pre-order tickets. Its not worth it.",4,11,18,17 December 2015
