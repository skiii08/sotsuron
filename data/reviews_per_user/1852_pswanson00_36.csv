Ford v Ferrari," My opinion: Motorhead necessity
","I've had a mild obsession with the GT40 since I got to see the winning car up close in 1966, just a few days after the race, so I am not an impartial viewer. Giving such a movie 10 stars may seem excessive, but for this type of film I think it's perfect. The characters, both central and peripheral, are performed perfectly, and the film includes the best in-car race footage since Grand Prix. Side note: the sound systems in modern theaters have often caused me enough discomfort to cause me to put in ear plugs, but the sound of a full-race 427 at high rpm didn't bother me at all.",10,2,4,17 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," minimally entertaining
","This film is but a feeble reflection of the vision and execution of the original Star Wars trilogy. In the company of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, two truly excellent trained actors, Natalie Portman sounds as if she's reading her lines off the side of a cereal box. Also, I think the only correct application of computer-generated effects in movies is as inconspicuous set elements, or perhaps to simulate something passing by which doesn't require the viewer to pay attention. Having a prominent supporting role filled by a being which only exists in a circuit board is an insult to the viewer. Each of the original 3 films made me want to see the next one in the series; this film made me NOT want to see the next one.",2,36,69,2 January 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," spoilers only give away surprises--GREAT film
","The first time I saw 'Raiders,' I waited until it had been out a couple of months and school was back in session (a combination of factors which will probably never happen again, because it seems that distributors now pull movies out of the theaters 3 weeks after they're released, or the day there's a 2% drop in attendance, whichever comes first), went to a REAL movie theater, the kind with a Cinerama screen (which no longer exist), plopped myself down squarely in the center of the theater, and let the film carry me away. It may've been the best movie-going experience of my life. Other than an ending which I felt did not live up to the rest of the film, I loved the whole thing. My favorite short scene is the fight with the giant in Cairo. Dozens, maybe hundreds of times in my life I have screamed at TV or movie screens when a protagonist throws down a perfectly functional weapon to fight the immense bad guy with his bare hands. When Dr. Jones drew his .45 and popped Goliath, I screamed with joy and almost fell off my seat laughing. Thank you for a hero with brains!!!This is an all-time great adventure film. I also am very fond of 'Last Crusade,' but 'Raiders' is the mother of them all -- including endless rip-offs, unfortunately -- and a must-see for any movie fan.",10,0,1,17 March 2005
Casablanca," top 5
","I didn't see Casablanca all the way through until I was in my late 20's, and I'm glad. I wouldn't have appreciated the truth behind the actions and relationships of the characters at an earlier age. This is one of the world's great films.I remember one television viewing especially. I had returned home from seeing a movie which was so poor that I have no recollection as to what film it was. I got home just as Casablanca was starting, and -- in spite of, or maybe beCAUSE of having already seen a movie that day -- sat mesmerized through the entire film. When it was over I looked at my wife and said 'Do you think the guy who made that piece of crap we saw earlier has ever even SEEN a good movie?' I suspect that some young film makers have not. Casablanca has, besides one of the great casts in film history: sharp, smartly paced dialogue; layers of true- to-life stories; superb black-and-white photography. Anyone who has ever lost at love will ache as the characters wrestle with life-affecting decisions which wrench the heart. This is a great film.",10,2,3,26 March 2005
Chinatown," Gordian knot
","If ever a movie begged to be seen more than once, this is it. I liked it the first time I saw it, but didn't really grasp the twists of plot and character until my 3rd viewing. I've now seen it...maybe 30 times, and am still intrigued by the story. As a native of southern California I grew up knowing something about Mulholland the Water Baron, on whom I assume aspects of both Hollis Mulwray and Noah Cross were based, and this fictionalization imparts the intrigues and era extremely well. Polanski was fortunate that -- when filming Chinatown -- there were still authentic locations in existence; someone would be harder- pressed to simulate 1930's L.A. now. Chinatown clearly has aspects of genuine Film Noir, but as translated by Roman Polanski it's darker and, well, creepier than almost any such film. I strongly recommend Chinatown to any adult viewer.",10,2,4,19 February 2005
A Star Is Born," Surprisingly good
","First: before this film, I was really not aware of who Bradley Cooper is, and was barely aware of Lady Gaga. When I heard that the film was being made, I thought 'Again! How many times do they need to film this story?' I like each of the three earlier versions to varying degrees, and this version is worthy to hold up its head in the company of the others. I really enjoyed seeing Ms. Germanotta (her real name) without feathers and makeup, and to hear that she can REALLY sing! Over the years there has been more than one popular artist who had minimal talent, but good electronic voice enhancement, and choreography to distract from the music. Gaga is not one of those; she is the real deal. I was surprised to see that Mr. Cooper is a reasonable singer himself, and either really plays guitar, or is very good at simulating it. I cannot remember the last time that music went straight to my emotions the way that some of the songs in this film did. The first time the 2 characters sang 'Shallow' in concert, I just sat in front of the TV blubbering and blowing my nose. I found it amazing that Bradley cooper also directed. I'm goin to have to seek out more of his work. Minor sidebar: I ride motorcycles and love dogs, and I was delighted that one of each was featured in this movie.",9,0,1,11 October 2019
As Good as It Gets," Wonderful
","There are so many great things about this film that it's hard to list them all. First is an intelligent script. There's great dialogue in this film, reminiscent of the best of the 30's, e.g. The Thin Man series. A great script is no good without great people to deliver it, and this movie was perfectly cast. Here we see the true star quality of Helen Hunt. There are few actors who can share a screen with Jack Nicholson and have the audience watch them instead of Jack, but she is one. Greg Kinnear is flawless as the artist neighbor, and does a spot-on Nicholson impression,too. Cuba Gooding, fresh from Jerry Maguire, is superb in a small supporting role. Harold Ramis as the doctor and Shirley Knight as Helen's mom are, as ever, perfect. Even Skeet Ulrich, playing a thoroughly detestable character, does a great job. As Good As It Gets is more character study than romantic comedy, although there are certainly plenty of laughs. There are also plenty of tears, and just plain pangs of sympathy. See this film.",10,0,1,6 April 2005
Captain Marvel," Disappointing
","I was expecting an origin story, something like Superman, but that is not the thrust of this film. For the first 20 minutes I was bombarded by flash cuts, not explained, but apparently concerning somebody or something attempting to probe the central character's memories. The rest of the film was what has become standard: heaps of pyrotechnic special effects, with the thinnest thread of a story to go with them. I'll be ignoring the inevitable sequel.",6,3,5,4 August 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Inferior to the original
","Firstly, this film is too long. Secondly, it's very confusing. Thirdly, far too much of it is spent watching various configurations of computer-generated sea life. Fourthly, Johhny Depp has taken an exaggerated character and created a caricature of that exaggeration. The new Jack Sparrow appears even more than before to be in a constant state of intoxication, and has become quite effeminate, almost a Pirate Queen. I did appreciate the studio's small nods to old movies, especially Disney's own 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Davy Jones' organ-playing and the battles with a tentacled monster were both straight out of that film, and Orlando Bloom's sliding-down-the-sail-with-a- knife-stuck-through-it was lifted from Douglas Fairbanks Sr.'s silent The Black Pirate. Kevin Mcnally as Gibbs stole every scene in which he appeared, and was a major high point of the film for me. It was reassuring to see Geoffrey Rush at the end, as he gave me hope that the third -- and I hope, final -- 'P.O.C.' movie will be better than this one.",5,2,3,8 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Never again
","I've seen the 2nd and 3rd P.O.C. movies on their opening days, and I won't bother to see the 4th until I've read a LOT of reviews of it. This synopsis could be subtitled '3 hours of my life I'll never get back.' Where shall I begin? Firstly, and surprisingly to me, this is NOT a movie for children. It starts with mass hangings, including the execution of a child, and continues to multiple disturbingly violent deaths. It also contains many bits of sexual innuendo and symbolism, as well as Ragetti looking up Elizabeth Swann's dress. Secondly, there is no story here, and the only characters worthy of the name are in supporting roles. Kevin McNally as Gibbs is superb, the highlight of the film for me. Keith Richards was spot-on in his cameo, and should make more films. I admit that I found Ms. Swann's stepping up to a position of leadership toward the end to be marvelous, and showed a potential for K.K.'s character to become a genuine role model for girls, in a film industry which usually gives females the greasy end of the stick. The attempts at comic relief with the 2 doltish guards and the Pintel and Ragetti characters only emphasized to me the lack of entertainment in the rest of the film. Thirdly, special effects are fine as devices to support the telling of a story, but they should not be a SUBSTITUTE for the telling of a story. This...thing is founded upon too many curses and spells without any human interest to support them. I love seafaring stories, and consequently enjoy many pirate stories. I would rather watch the black-and-white Wallace Beery/Jackie Cooper Treasure Island daily than ever watch this film again. I would also prefer Cutthroat Island, A Muppet Treasure Island, or Captain Blood. Anyone who wants to see an actual tale of the sea, not a triumph of the Disney marketing department, should run, not walk, to acquire a copy of Master and Commander. It contains no pirates, but when it come to portraying the days of wooden ships and iron men, it is the real thing.",2,9,14,26 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," entertaining allegory
","I like this film pretty well -- much better than installment 2 -- but it has FAR too many story lines. I appreciate subplots and intertwined stories which converge and come to fruition together, but there are too many in this film. We have: a walking gravel pit for whom we feel compassion; an extraterrestrial sludge spider which alters the personalities of people it touches; M.J. vacillating among commitment to Peter, Harry, and her career; Harry brutally coercing M.J. into crushing Peter's feelings; Peter succumbing (temporarily, of course) to the intoxicating power of the sludge spider; Eddie Brock succumbing to the sludge, being rescued from it by Peter, then diving back into it at the worst moment. Cutting a couple of characters completely would have made this a much tighter film. I DID enjoy thoroughly the depth of the supporting cast, especially J.K. Simmons' over- the-top portrayal of Peter's editor. To put it simply, he's a hoot. Also, the cool, aggressive Peter Parker, diddybopping around town with the Black Spider suit under his clothes, did so exactly as Normal Peter would've done it, with the slightly spastic style of a dancing nerd, rather than Travolta smoothness. It worked for me. While M.J. was stranded in the dangling taxi, it occurred to me that she was awfully helpless for a young woman of the 21st century. I felt much better about her character when she chucked the concrete block onto Eddie Brock, then had the presence of mind to dive out of the car when the truck was falling toward her. She vindicated herself nicely. I also was delighted to learn that the gray-haired guy who had one line -- obviously a cameo -- was Stan lee, the creator of Spider Man. I'm glad that those who are interpreting the stories for modern audiences appreciate their origins. To sum up: it's decent entertainment, and that's from a guy who hasn't read a Spider Man comic in 35 years. Rent; enjoy! P.S. The outtakes on the DVD are hilarious, so don't miss them.",7,1,2,6 December 2007
Snatch," Great Fun
","An English friend of mine recommended that I see both Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. He guessed my sense of humor right, because I love them both. The viewer needs to possess tolerance for a certain amount of violence, and a black sense of humor helps. It also helps if the viewer has seen a lot of BBC America broadcasts, or has a natural aptitude for interpreting accents, because they're pretty thick in places. Brad Pitt's mumbling is completely unintelligible to me, but my Limey buddy assures me that he used a genuine Irish-gypsy accent. Unless they're aching to see Brad Pitt, I wouldn't think most women would enjoy this film. The ones who do are my kinda gals! This is an enjoyable film...for the right audience.",8,0,1,6 April 2005
The Bodyguard," chicks only need apply
","Too long, tedious, boring, mind-numbing, poorly-written, gag-me-with-an-adolescent- fantasy piece of crap. I love many movies which are commonly referred to as Chick Flicks, but this hunk of junk is too much for me. The soundtrack is pretty good. I don't know how I can stretch my comments to 10 lines. I did read that Kevin Costner's part was originally written for Steve McQueen, and he may've been able to pull it off. Note that K.C. has Steve's haircut. This is a demonstration that celebrity in one area doesn't necessarily to talent in another area. The film needs a female lead who can act, and ol' Whitney ain't the gal for the job.",2,16,36,27 October 2006
The Best Years of Our Lives," Superb
","This is not just an excellent film, it is an historical document, a true slice of post-war life.  It should not only be required viewing for film students, as another reviewer suggested, but also for students of history. I was born in 1947, and remember clearly my parents and their friends in the 1950's showing many of the characteristics of the people portrayed in this movie.  They were so energetic in their pursuit of both accomplishment and FUN that they became caricatures to many of my contemporaries, and stimulated much of  the cross-generational conflict of the 60's and 70's. The writing and casting of this film are as close to perfect as I ever need to see, and creative photography and staging only add to its greatness.  I recommend this film to anyone.",10,2,3,6 June 2004
Lost in Translation," I love this film.
","I'm particularly fond of quiet little movies with no special effects or billion-dollar ad campaigns, and this is one of those. The characters drawn by the writers and performers are beautifully crafted. Bill Murray is at his non-clownish best, and Scarlett Johansson is exquisite...and not just for her looks (Yes, I have a slight infatuation with her. What straight man doesn't? I didn't realize until this week that she was only 17 when this movie was filmed (gasp!)). This is a very true tale of two people who are bound together almost by accident: first out of boredom, then out of mutual interest and respect. They have a strong affection for one another, but engage in no sexual activity beyond a couple of kisses. I cannot recommend this film strongly enough, for any viewer mature enough to appreciate it. I was delighted to learn that Sofia Coppola's efforts were rewarded financially. This sweet film cost $4,000,000 to make, and grossed $111,000,000 worldwide. Huzzah!",10,3,4,10 June 2016
Footloose," loosely-woven fun
","This film has several flaws -- Lori Singer's rural accent comes and goes, mostly goes; the members of her high-school class, who've never attended so much as a lunch-hour sock hop, turn into some of the greatest dancers in middle America during the last 10 minutes -- but who cares? FOOTLOOSE is great fun, and is worth seeing. It even contains a redeeming social message about values and tolerance. Sit back and enjoy the sheer exuberance of Sarah Jessica Parker, the pre-corpulent Chris Penn, the lung-collapsing beauty of Lori Singer, and the energy and enthusiasm of Kevin Bacon. I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 10.",7,1,3,2 November 2003
Collateral," Good Film--spoilers give away story elements.
","I like this film a lot. It's nice to see a movie which requires thought, while also having great suspense and action. Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as the coldly professional slayer who has the gift of great personal charm, which he can turn on as necessary. Jamie Foxx gives a preview of his Oscar-winning form, with a spot-on portrayal of a conscientious ordinary guy who is forced to adapt to unimaginable circumstances. He's especially effective when he has to persuade a drug lord that he's a hit man; that's when I knew that his character had opted for survival, no matter what. Collateral is in a class with, but quite different from, The Fugitive. Each is an action film which requires thought, and each one will provide great entertainment to viewers who like such films.",9,2,3,4 April 2005
Bridesmaids," Not funny, reeeally notttttt
","First, I admit that I didn't watch this entire film. Actually, I COULDN'T watch the whole thing; I was giving myself a headache from rolling my eyes. According to the Scene Index, I saw half of the movie before I gave up. My wife gave up after the opening scene, and could watch no more.I'd read that Melissa McCarthy's performance was the highlight of the film, but even she did not provide enough laughs to keep me watching. In its essence this is a guy movie with a female cast. Actually, it's a 'Dude,' or maybe 'DOOD!' movie. It is one disgusting scene after another, with very, very, very (very, very) few actual laughs interspersed. The opening scene of simulated sex was the first thing to raise my doubts as to the film's value. Not much later there was a protracted scene wherein the bride's old friend and new friend have a verbal duel as to which is the closest friend. The scene might have worked if it had been about 20% as long as it was. This boring, bitchy debate was followed by projectile vomiting and acute diarrhea while the gang of women is shopping for dresses. That was the final straw for me. I'm beyond astounded at the number of award nominations that this film received. I am appalled and nauseated that it actually won AFI film of the year. I suppose it's possible that the second half of the film evolved into the worthwhile entity that some reviews say it is, but I think it's the worst piece of crap I've endured since Doctor T and the Women. Stay away. Do not watch this movie.",1,4,7,11 May 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," 'Extending beyond the usual or ordinary, especially in size or scope.'
","My 'Summary' is one of the definitions of Epic, and it applies to this film perhaps more than any other. The life of T.E. Lawrence is shown as few other men have ever been presented. Born Thomas Edward Chapman, the bastard son of Thomas Chapman and Sarah, the governess of his children, the man we know as T.E. Lawrence rose from what could have been the lowest possible social circumstances to become the best-known English-speaking warrior of his time. How much of his fame is deserved, and how much is due to the publicity generated by the newsreels of Lowell Thomas is hard to say now, but there is no denying that Lawrence was an extraordinary man. David Lean was an equally extraordinary filmmaker. As the reader may've guessed, I'm a student of the life of Lawrence, inspired as a young teenager by seeing this movie. I now know that the movie is not a precisely-accurate historical document, but it imparts the basic chronology of the best-known era of Lawrence's life, as well as a feel for the nature of the man. His physical appearance -- 5'6' and plain of face -- was nothing like the handsome, 6-foot Peter O'Toole, but he clearly possessed at least some of the personal flair ascribed to him in this film. Creation of the film was a monumental task, with much of the filming occurring in temperatures exceeding 125 degrees Fahrenheit (!!). The crew had to invent ways to cool the cameras, to keep the film from being destroyed by heat before it was processed. The fact that the crew's shared suffering resulted in this excellent film and not mass murder is a tribute to the director. I won't rhapsodize about the cast, the scenery, the sheer mass of people required to make Lawrence of Arabia, I'll just sum up with this: this is an all-time great film, and should be seen by everyone. That's it.",10,2,6,28 March 2005
Moulin Rouge!," Be forewarned
","First, a confession: I didn't watch the whole movie. The first 15 minutes of this film are so frenzied, and do so little to propel anything resembling a story, that I couldn't stand the thought of sitting through the whole thing. I am a fan of both Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, and I found their talents to be completely wasted in this brightly-colored mess. Maybe I'm too old to get it; this appears to have been edited for the MTV generation, or any viewer with a severely limited attention span. I need to add lines in order to have my review accepted, so I will say that the set design was spectacular, although with too many computer-generated backgrounds for me. Maybe if this comes on Showtime sometime when I'm suffering insomnia, I'll give it another try...but I doubt it.",1,3,6,2 January 2005
Black Snake Moan," Shockingly great film
","Where do I begin? Let me say that -- after having watched the entire film and the special features on the DVD -- my wife and I watched the whole film again with the director's commentary running. I can't remember having ever before endured more than 7 minutes of such commentary for a film. It's worth hearing.I'm not a southern boy, but I spent some time around Memphis a long time ago, and have a feel for the area. This film almost smells of the South, it's so real. Samuel Jackson, one of my all-time favorite actors, is magnificent as the emotionally bent Lazarus, and Christina Ricci gives the performance of a lifetime as Rae, a woman who's been wounded severely during her brief life. I've always liked Ms. Ricci's work, but in this performance she's giving 137% of herself every second she's on the screen. Awards and little statues are not enough to reward her for what she lays before the audience in this film. There are other places where you can read the essence of the story, so I'm just commenting on the work. I'd heard the name Justin Timberlake before seeing 'BSM,' but had no idea what he looked like, or even why he's famous. Bumping my head on 60 years old, I'm outside his target demographic, to say the least. After seeing this film I will recognize him. He can act! He gives a substantial, believable performance as the loving soulmate of the county slut. The director is from Memphis, and shows reverence for his home region. He is also a fine story teller......and I MUST mention the music. I love Blues, and the soundtrack for Black Snake Moan is a veritable feast for a blues fan. I'm writing less coherently than usual because my enthusiasm for this movie is overcoming my sentence structure. See this film, and I mean now.",10,3,6,3 July 2007
Singin' in the Rain," singin' when I watch it
","This movie is funny, satirical, has great singing and dancing, and gave Debbie Reynolds her final boost to stardom. What more can one ask from a musical? I usually find nits to pick in even the best of films, but I can't think of a thing I would change about Singin' In The Rain. 50 minutes into this film is what one could argue is the greatest tap-dance number ever filmed (apologies and a nod to the Nicholas Brothers), with Kelly and O'Connor defying the laws of physics and the limitations of the human anatomy with almost every move. It's no accident that That's Entertainment includes more than one sequence from this great movie; for sheer entertainment value, it will never be surpassed.",10,0,1,18 June 2006
Taken," Excellent violent fun
","I knew this would be good when I saw Luc Besson's name in the credits. For those who don't know, he wrote and directed La Femme Nikita, one of the great Violent Entertainments of all time. I enjoyed Taken. Imagine the daughter of a 50-year-old Jason Bourne being kidnapped, and the pure shitstorm which would descend upon the perpetrators, and you'll have a pretty good handle on this story. As others have mentioned, the plot is simplicity itself: Liam Neeson is going to get his daughter back, and no thing or individual will prevent that. There is, of course, the usual need for suspension of disbelief—in the first gunfight, our hero has inconsistent marksmanship; aboard the yacht at the end it's one bullet, one kill—but hey, that's film making. Viewers whose expectations are within the Revenge Mission scope of this film will enjoy it thoroughly. Anyone looking for social depth or complex character development will be disappointed.",7,0,0,20 July 2009
The World's Fastest Indian," Bloody great!
","'Spoiler' noted only because I may reveal surprises.Unlike some reviewers I AM a motorcycle fan, but that isn't a requirement for the enjoyment of this film. TWFI goes far beyond merely showing the life of a gearhead, with a clear, compassionate display of human dedication and perseverance. The fact that it also manages to show accurately the behavior of a man whose life is centered around machinery is icing on the cake for me. Example: Burt trimming his toenails with a sanding attachment on a drill motor. That is exactly the sort of solution a man like him would've found for a grooming challenge. Example: trimming the weeds in the yard by dousing them with gasoline and lighting them. Again, very true-to-life. The production of the movie also showed a real commitment to accuracy and excellence. According to the review in Motorcycle Consumer News, the junk lying around Burt's shop was the real Burt Munro's actual junk, including melted pistons and blown cylinders ruined during his development of the Indian's engine. Also, even more amazingly, the cars on the salt at Bonneville were not copies, not period-correct restorations, but THE ACTUAL vehicles which were there when Burt Munro ran. How the producers were able to persuade the museums in which those beauties normally reside to allow them to return to the abrasive, corrosive environment of a salt flat is beyond my imagination. I just know that they bring an air of reality to this film which one doesn't see often in modern films. I think that even viewers who couldn't tell a piston from a pinto pony will still feel the reality of the environments shown in this film, will 'get the vibe,' so to speak. Anthony Hopkins is, as ever, brilliant. There are other actors who could've done a good job of portraying Burt Munro, but there is no one who could have done it better. Actors of his caliber don't go to work with the thought that someone will award them a gold statue for their work, but it will be a shame if he is not nominated for every possible award for this role. TWFI is the kind of subtle, quiet film which sometimes escapes the notice of award-givers; I hope it gets noticed.",10,3,3,26 February 2006
Avatar," computer-generated genocide
","The special effects are fascinating, but the characters and plot are as trite as they can be. There's no message here that is not present in many Hollywood westerns, or any film concerning imperialist intrusion into a primitive way of life. To sum it up, If Whitey Wants Your Natural Resources, He'll Tear Up Anything To Get Them. From the 15th to the 19th centuries the world learned this lesson from the Spanish, French, Dutch, Portugese, and English. I laughed out loud when I realized that Giovanni Ribisi's character wasn't kidding when he referred to the object of his mining project as Unobtainium. That word has been used colloquially by motorheads for at least 35 years as a way of referring to any expensive, high- tech metal, especially titanium and magnesium. I don't know whether James Cameron thought he made it up, or if he heard a couple of bikers talking in a parking lot and absorbed it subliminally. Either way, it turned what was intended to be a significant scene into a big chuckle. The only reason I gave this overlong cartoon more than 2 stars is the fact that I admire the effort of the actors, as well as the technical expertise of the CG people. The fact that this was nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards tells me that either: (A) the choices that year were few; or (B) the members of the academy have lost all taste and perception. As long as the viewer doesn't expect Avatar to be great cinematic literature. she or he can probably be entertained and not disappointed.",4,4,6,16 May 2012
Love & Mercy," Good, but not perfect
","Overall, I like the film. It does, unfortunately, have a great number of flat spots, minutes when there's no action or dialogue, which I finally took to fast-forwarding through.
The film does a good job of showing us the deep problems of Brian Wilson, and also his indisputable genius. I now appreciate 'Good Vibrations: more than ever, and I've always liked it.
Side note: Paul Giamatti, a superb character actor, does an excellent job as Eugene Landy, the vile subhuman who had taken over Wilson's life. All through the film I was hoping someone would hit his character with a heavy object.",7,2,3,22 June 2019
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Hilarious, for the right audience.
","I like this film a lot, but it is REEally not for everybody. Firstly, it will help non-English viewers if they watch a lot of BBC America, because the accents are a bit thick. There's even a scene in which a lot of Cockney rhyming slang is flying around which sometimes is broadcast with subtitles...and it needs them! Secondly, there's a fair amount of violence in 'Lock, Stock,'... and even though some is humorous, it's decidedly black humor. The scene toward the end where you might say 'everybody gets his' could be used in a horror film, if it weren't for the ridiculous circumstances which brought the participants together. Guy Ritchie did a masterful job of relieving tension almost as it was being created, without spoiling either the tension or the laughs. The casting of this film is a fine example of getting a good portrayal of a tough guy by hiring a genuinely tough man to play him. Vinnie Jones, P.H. Moriarty, and the late, great Lenny McLean all had real hard-man credibility established before they started acting, and it brought a reality to their work which is hard to get. Sting's work in a small role is perfect, by the way; he should act more. To sum up: pour a Guinness and enjoy L,S, & 2 S.B. -- it is great.",8,4,4,6 September 2007
When Harry Met Sally...," peerless
","I love romantic comedies, and this may be my all-time favorite. Nora Ephron's writing is sharp and VERY funny, and the perfect cast delivers the dialogue with flawless timing. I own it on DVD, and will almost invariably turn to it for at least a couple of minutes when I see it in the TV schedule. There are so many priceless moments that I can't pick out one to highlight; most of them are subtler and funnier than the famous Simulated Orgasm scene. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are perfect in their supporting roles, and Rob Reiner's direction couldn't be better. I'm afraid that I'm doing nothing but gushing in this review, but great is great, and it's hard to say anything else.",10,84,101,19 February 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," sort of funny
","Going by the trailers, I expected this film to be more satirical and less stupid than it is. It's still pretty funny, especially to someone who lived in the San Diego area for more than 30 years. I think that people in the TV news business must bust a gut watching Anchorman, as the stereotyped characters really do exist. I really got a laugh out of all the uncredited cameos (see below), especially Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller. I didn't know that Tony Dow or Missi Pyle was in it until I read the IMDb credits. This movie is certainly longer than it needs to be, but it's reasonably amusing, and I got a couple of belly laughs out of it. I'd suggest you watch it if you can do it cheaply, but don't buy a copy.

Step Up," enjoyable crap
","For anyone who's ever seen a movie, there are no surprises in this film. Everything about it is predictable, including the death of one of the protagonist's friends. The plot is as thin as Kleenex, but the dancing IS quite good. I'm at least 3 times the age of the target demographic for this film, and -- surprise to me -- I actually liked the music! The big obstacle to my enjoyment of the non-dancing part of the film was the central character. For the first half of the movie I thought he was a reprehensible, thieving, moron who should be shot on sight, saving the state in which he lived the trouble of executing him later. By the end he had improved in my eyes slightly, but not much. Through the entire film I was hoping he'd eventually appear in some pants which actually fit him, and ditch the bleeping backwards ballcap while dancing. This is an idiotic youth film which happens to employ some good dancers. I was deeply surprised to see Rachel Griffiths in this film, as her work with which I'm familiar is much edgier, has much more of an independent energy. This is decent entertainment if you love dance, but at the bottom of my personal list of dance movies.",5,0,1,13 April 2007
Casino Royale," Excellent
","Giving a film such as this a vote of 10 may seem like a stretch of standards, but Casino Royale is absolutely perfect for the genre, so what else could I say? Daniel Craig is the quintessential Bond, surpassing my previous favorite -- Sean Connery -- for adherence to the nature of the character (with acknowledgement of Timothy Dalton's fine effort). Eva Green is also great as Vesper, and Judy Dench is...well, her peerless self. I appreciate especially that the special effects in this film are there to aid the telling of the story, not as a SUBSTITUTE for a story, which they are in so many modern movies. As in most 007 films, the locations are magnificent, almost becoming characters themselves. I look forward eagerly to the next installment, not leastly to see what the filmmakers do with Jeffrey Wright. He's much too good an actor to have been hired to lean on a table and utter 4 lines, and I can't wait to see how his character develops. Rent this film. It is real entertainment.",10,0,6,11 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Could've been better
","This film is derived heavily from the original Star Wars, but—as the source material is pretty darn good—I still enjoyed it. I was disappointed that the climactic battle was almost identical to that in the first film. I would have liked to know something about the family for whom Rey was waiting, and I thought the explanation of the miraculous reappearance of Poe was a bit thin.I did enjoy the near-invisible appearances by some excellent English actors, including Pip Torrens, Simon Pegg, Harriet Walter, and Emun Elliott (star of The Paradise on PBS). I hoped to see Denis Lawson, as his character was one of the few fighter pilots to survive the original trilogy. Mark Hamill's appearance surprised me. I thought he was Oliver Reed until I recalled that Reed is long-deceased, and Hamill looked as Reed would have about 35 years ago. As long as the viewer doesn't expect ground-breaking originality, this is an enjoyable film.",7,3,23,30 January 2016
Shall We Dance," Okay
","This movie is reasonably diverting, but more so if you're seeking plain-old 21st-century American entertainment, and are not a fan of the original Japanese version. Richard Gere's character's primary motivation is the jaded ennui of the long-married businessman, but the story lacks -- and could never have, really -- the cultural conflict which is the main vein of tension in the Japanese film. Another fact which dilutes the impact of this film is that Gere is nowhere nearly as good a ballroom dancer as Koji Yakusho, who must have struggled in the early scenes to look like a beginner. Summary of an unusually short review: this movie's all right, but the original version is much, MUCH, better.",6,1,2,16 July 2006
Heat," Almost great.
","This comes close to being a great film, but is stuck at being merely good. If it were re-edited to eliminate between 45 and 60 minutes of the touchy-feely relationship crap, its greatness would be complete. This is not the observation of a misogynist action-film maven -- romantic comedies are among my favorite films -- but of a movie lover who's upset by what appears to have been conscious insertion of structural flaws into the plot in order to appeal to a wider audience. The pacing of the action is wonderful until about an hour before the end. We then must digress into the personal lives of the central characters to see 'Awww, they do have relationships and lives outside of work.' We then get back to resolution of the film's primary conflict, and on to a satisfactory ending. This is not the film for that sort of thing, and it is flawed for that reason. It's still worth seeing, just leave the room about 2 hours in, make a sandwich, and return about 45 minutes later.",8,0,1,5 June 2004
Hustle & Flow," Uncomfortably great
","I didn't expect to like this film, but I've recently seen Terrence Howard in Idlewild and Craig Brewer's wonderful Black Snake Moan, so when my wife suggested we try it, I agreed. I was knocked out by Terrence Howard's performance. I've wondered what I'll say if someone asks me 'What's that movie about?' On the surface it's the story of a pimp who wants to be a rapper. What it's really about is human aspiration, the hopes and dreams which keep us alive. It's about caring for the people around you. It's about perseverance in the face what look like insurmountable obstacles. It's about real people.I'm a 60-year-old white guy, and even the rhythm of rap usually makes me want to run from the room and plug my ears. Having now, through this film, shared DJay's creative process, I can now appreciate the message and emotion behind it. I still don't like the medium in which the message is sent, but I'm no longer instantly repelled by it. I've found myself humming 'It's hard out here for a pimp,' which is so ironic that I just laugh when I find myself doing it. I didn't watch last year's Academy Awards, and was not aware that Terrence Howard had been nominated for his performance in this film. I was delighted to learn that he had been, as performances in low-budget films seem often to be overlooked. This an excellent, if disturbing, film.",9,1,2,23 July 2007
From Here to Eternity," almost documentary
","May give away surprises to new viewers. To me this this film is a slice of real Army pre-war life, dramatized just enough to make it entertaining. It is true to its subject and characters, and includes marvelous performances, notably by Frank Sinatra. His career, stagnant due to his having outgrown his Teen Idol status, was re-energized in a big way. I won't dwell on the topics others have covered in praising this excellent film; I DO want to point out two examples of great, great film making. Montgomery Clift as Prew playing Taps upon the death of Sinatra's Maggio is one of the most moving scenes ever put on film. The musician who actually played the instrument was a virtuoso, as the emotion expressed in the performance is tangible. That scene is followed almost immediately by Clift accosting Ernest Borgnine -- the man responsible for the death of his friend -- and asking him to step into an alley. In just a few seconds the two of them are locked in a knife fight to the death, while in the background, just feet away, pedestrians are strolling along Hotel Street, happy honky-tonk music playing in the distance. The contrast between the human activities happening in the same scene is a masterpiece of direction. See this film.",9,1,1,11 March 2006
