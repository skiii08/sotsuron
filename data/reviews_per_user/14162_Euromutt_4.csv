Come and See," Very worthwhile, though not without annoyances
","Overall, I enjoyed (if that is the word) 'Idi i smotri.' The imagery is powerful, the scenery is magnificent, the military hardware is an anorak's dream, the overall plot is gripping and the climactic points in the action are nothing short of terrifying. In depicting the gruesomeness of war, this film pulls no punches whatsoever, and from that it derives a lot of its power. Even if you've seen 'Schindler's List,' 'Saving Private Ryan,' etc., this film will still shock you. The characters' motivations and thought processes are often somewhat incomprehensible, but given the situations in which they find themselves, this is understandable. However, the film is significantly longer than it needs to be, mostly because a great many scenes drag on well past the point of annoyance. Watching this film on DVD, I was mercifully able to fast forward through segments where nothing would happen for minutes at a time. Another point that niggles is the behavior of the Germans. Their almost casual brutality, even towards the Byelorussian police and militia collaborating with them, is perfectly credible. But there is a point in the film prior to which the Germans' behavior is cold and methodical ('grÃ¼ndlich'). Then, from one moment to the next (at the start of chapter 11 on the DVD), all discipline goes out the window and they start behaving as if they're at Club Med instead of in territory crawling with hostile partisans. This is rather jarring, and detracts somewhat from the film's credibility. All told, though, I thoroughly recommend this film, albeit it primarily to war movie buffs.",8,5,10,2 February 2005
No Man's Land," A promising, but ultimately flawed, small-scale war drama
","No Man's Land starts out as a very promising war movie as three wounded soldiers, two Bosniaks and one Serb, find themselves stuck in an abandoned trench between their respective armies in 1994. The Bosniaks cannot leave because one of them, Cera, has had his body booby-trapped while unconscious; the Serb, Nino, cannot leave because the second Bosniak, Ciki, is holding him as protection against Serb artillery. Unable to come up with a solution, the commanding officers on both sides call on UNPROFOR to resolve the situation. It is at this point that the film starts to display its flaws, and a number of these must be laid at the door of Danis Tanovic, both director and author of the screenplay. Tanovic appears to harbour an - admittedly understandable - bitterness towards the international community, particularly the United Nations, for its role in the conflict, but in getting his message across, he takes a series of liberties with realism. Tanovic portrays the UNPROFOR personnel - with the exception of the French Sgt. Marchand - as too petty, incompetent, cowardly and callously apathetic to get risk getting involved, and while there may have been some truth to this, Tanovic lays it on so thick it becomes gratuitous. Symptomatic of this is a moment where Marchand's superior, Cpt. Dubois, berates the journalist Jane Livingstone for listening in on his company's radio frequency; those familiar with UN peacekeeping mandates know that the troops are explicitly required to broadcast 'in the clear' so that anyone can listen in. In another scene, a British colonel flies in from Zagreb, bringing his overly blonde and leggy 'secretary' with him - considering the colonel's supposed obsession with his media image, this is too much for the viewer's willing suspension of disbelief to take. In conclusion, what might have been an excellent war drama, with tension being periodically relieved by wry humour, is ultimately marred by Tanovic's rather heavy-handed axe-grinding.",Null,0,1,14 November 2002
The Last Samurai," Dances with cherry blossoms (possible spoilers)
","Quick plot synopsis: Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a captain in the US cavalry and a veteran of the civil war and various campaigns against the Plains Indians. At the start of film, we find him in San Francisco in 1876, tormented by guilt over his participation in the massacre of a Cheyenne village, a torment which he is trying (in vain) to drown with alcohol. He is approached by Omura (Harada), a minister in the Meiji government of Japan, to help train the new Japanese conscript army to defeat a rebellion by traditionalist samurai, led by a daimyo named Katsumoto (Watanabe). Over Algren's objections, Omura throws the troops into battle prematurely, and the first engagement results in a rout for the Imperial troops. Algren, despite putting up a spirited resistance, is captured by Katsumoto's samurai. He is transported to Katsumoto's fief, which is soon isolated by the onset of winter. During his captivity, Algren comes to learn and appreciate the ways of the samurai, and becomes sympathetic to Katsumoto's cause. The spring brings an attempt at rapprochement between the government and Katsumoto, but when diplomacy breaks down (due to treachery by Omura), Algren sides with Katsumoto for the climactic battle between the traditionalists and the reformers.Let me state that, in many ways, 'The Last Samurai' is a magnificent film; the acting ranges from adequate to excellent, the cinematography is fabulous, the production values are top notch, and the scenery is nothing short of stunning. So why did I hate it?First and foremost, the script is an exercise in one-sided stereotypes. Katsumoto and his samurai are without exception loyal, brave and true, not to mention honourable and selfless, desiring only to serve the best interests of the emperor and people of Japan. Perish the thought that they might be fighting to retain a feudal system in which they are on top of the heap, free to lord it over farmers, craftsmen and merchants, i.e. those who had to actually work, not only to provide for their own upkeep but for that of the daimyo and his samurai as well. How committed the warrior caste was to serving the people may be divined from the almost 3,000 peasant revolts which took place between 1590 and 1867, with increasing frequency and violence. The samurai are portrayed as disdaining guns as 'dishonourable.' For 'dishonourable' read 'allows a mere commoner to easily kill a samurai'; can't have that. But since such historical facts would get in the way of Logan and Zwick's glorification of the samurai, so no mention is made of them. As a result, it never occurs to Algren that the only reason his captors consider him worthy of even an opportunity to win their respect is because they know him only as a warrior, and that if they knew he was merely (in their book) an upstart farmboy, their attitude would likely be less friendly.To ensure maximum contrast with the noble samurai, their opponents are portrayed as having no redeeming features whatsoever. Omura and his henchmen are only interested in acquiring wealth and power, and are prepared to wade through the blood of innocents to achieve this. Omura even hints at plans for Japanese expansionism and the consequent need to match military power with the West; with this, he is simply reduced to a cardboard cut-out 1940s Hollywood 'Jap.' Of course, Omura is not a samurai, and therefore lacks their sense of honour. That the rulers of Japan, samurai included, had envisaged the subjugation of East Asia since the late Middle Ages (if not longer) is, again, conveniently ignored. Omura's American associates are similarly ruthless in the pursuit of riches, and more uncouth to boot. The Imperial cabinet and troops are either thugs or dupes (who realize the error of their ways only when it is too late). Obviously, nobody could really benefit from rejecting feudalism(!)Stereotyping aside, the script strains the viewer's (or at least, *this* viewer's) willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. Within a year, Algren has defeated his drinking problem, learnt to speak almost fluent Japanese, and has not only mastered the katana, but even manages to defeat multiple opponents while using two full-length swords. As students of martial technique (and role-playing geeks like myself) will know, the technique of fighting with two swords was reportedly developed in the early 17th century by the near-legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, who coined a number of names for it before settling on Niten Ichi-Ryu ('School of Two Heavens'). Also according to popular culture, none of Musashi's students (life-long samurai) could master it, and the technique died with its creator. Nevertheless, it seems to come naturally to Algren.Throughout the film, it takes at least three bullets to slow down any given samurai, and another three to actually kill him. For major characters like Katsumoto, Nobutada or Algren, the number is much higher. If that were realistic, one wonders why the Tokugawas were ever concerned about matchlocks; even breech-loaders should have posed no major worries.A host of ninja sent to assassinate Katsumoto fail mostly due to their complete failure to observe anything resembling stealth, supposedly their trademark. And, true to Hollywood, each shuriken thrown results in a guaranteed kill at 30 metres, whereas in actual fact, ninja would generally use shuriken not as a killing weapon, but to provide 'suppressing fire.' A ninja would throw a bunch of shuriken at pursuers, forcing them to seek cover while the ninja made his escape; any actual hits were an added bonus.Finally, at two and half hours, the film just collapses under its own weight. Even before the 'climactic' battle, each drawn-out samurai death was met with cries on my part of 'Just f*cking DIE already, you parasite!' When you find yourself rooting against the protagonists, it's not a good sign. On top of all that, the ending is just too ludicrous for words. By all means, watch 'The Last Samurai' for the eye candy (and Billy Connolly), but do not take it seriously.",4,1,3,10 June 2004
Enemy at the Gates," Somewhat forced blend of history and Hollywood
","Enemy At The Gates initially reminded me of a lot of other films; three which spring directly to mind being Saving Private Ryan for the grueling slaughter of almost helpless troops in the opening ten minutes, Shot Through The Heart for the opposing snipers theme, and Full Metal Jacket for the tension of urban close-quarters combat. This is not a historical document on the battle of Stalingrad, nor does it pretend to be, though the events depicted are, by and large, historically accurate, down to the character of the Russian sniper Zaitsev (Law). It should be noted, however, that the central character Zaitsev was by no means the only sniper of note at Stalingrad, and while some Soviet sources claim the duel with Koenig (Harris) actually occurred, this is not widely accepted, as no reports from the period make mention of it. Overall, I found the film gripping and entertaining as the relationship between Vassili Zaitsev, a conscript who finds himself used as a propaganda tool due to his skill as a sniper, and Danilov (Fiennes), the political officer who acts as his 'agent', develops. The mutual love interest Tania (Weisz) acts as a catalyst to the rivalry as Zaitsev comes to resent Danilov making political capital of him, which justifies the presence of the, presumably, historically inaccurate romance in the film. While a number of points jarred about the film, the accuracy of the uniforms, equipment, and vehicles is commendable from the point of view of a military history buff like myself. The actors do a fine job overall, and a number of the performances were refreshingly out of character - Law is distinctly rough around the edges for a change, and Bob Hoskins is almost unrecognizable as Nikita Kruchschev. However, both Harris and Fiennes leave an annoying amount of ambivalence as to the motivations and psychological makeup of their characters. A flaw in scripting of Zaitsev is his sudden hate towards Koenig at the end, despite the fact that Koenig has been picking of his comrades for the best part of the film. Also, given the carnage inflicted upon the troops on both sides and the civilians stuck in the middle, there is marked lack on the part of all characters of revulsion and resentment for the fact their political leaders are putting them through the meat grinder. Apparently, only American troops gripe about feeling their lives are being wasted for no good reason. But all this does not detract from the fact that Enemy At The Gates is well-researched, well-made, and thoroughly entertaining overall.",8,1,3,3 October 2001
