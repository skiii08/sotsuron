","Disney landed success with this very well crafted film. For moviegoers like me who like good tales in the classic big screen, this is a great one . I personally love period/ historic pictures . We who are not from U.S. find interesting to see done, this genre dealing with contemporary historic films . ¿ What a better way to learn about them in such detailed/recreated film ? Great CGI historic boats & settings, enhances the story . Again as a history fan it reminded myself of legendary tale JASON & THE ARGONAUTS . ....................................................................
