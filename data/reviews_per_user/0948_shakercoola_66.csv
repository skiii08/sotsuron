The Avengers," A romping rollercoast ride
","The main thing to say about the film is that it is its light-hearted touch and Robert Downey Jr and others delivering fast-talking one liners which break just at the right time. Some of the humour comes from the battle for screen supremacy among the Avengers.
That said, while the visual effects and stunts keep up viewer engagement, imagination does tend to lag behind - the fighting is repetitive. CGI is used well but some of the cartoonish manouevres made by the Hulk character in a film trying to keep some semblance of scientific plausibility are frankly implausible compared to the other Avengers. Tom Hiddlestone gives good menace with wide, piercing eyes and an almost sibilant line delivery, but he plays second fiddle to the prime villainy who are featureless.",7,0,1,25 July 2018
Come and See," Blood and mud in Belorussia
","A Soviet war drama thriller; A story set in Belarus about a boy hoping to defend his family during the Second World War.
This is an expressionist, graphic retelling of true events during 1943 when 628 villages and its inhabitants were destroyed by invading German forces. The film offers resiliance and dignity, and shows the endurance and anguish of war: a boy's lot in a man's war. There is some light relief too showing the camaraderie of the unfortunate beleagured souls.
As an aside, the director was on a mission to bring the terrible acts of inhumanity to light; he bluntly and angrily portrays the mania and brutality of the German SS and the genocidal attitudes of the German soldiers.",8,0,0,14 May 2018
The Incredible Hulk," More cartoonish than scary
","It's a par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, a very disposable fim and despite all the CGI rendering the kinetics are quite powerful, if completely implausible. There are no real surprises but the Hulk is a powerful theme and when the ol' red mist is rising we can all feel powerless to contain ourselves even if it is for just a split second before it subsides, which is why the Hulk's anger is so powerdul to behold.",6,0,3,24 July 2018
Mission: Impossible III," Mission MacGuffin
","This mission has all the sensational action scenes, breakneck speed, nonstop high-tech stuff, great stunts, and a very disturbing villain played seriously by Philip Seymour Hoffman, but it's samey and a lot of what goes on is implausible. The film is like a travel brochure to hang the big sequences on and this is one of several false notes. Some of the escapes are very far fetched, and implausible in other parts. The audience will forget about the nefarious device and not care what the Rabbit's foot really is.",6,0,0,14 August 2018
Iron Man 3," All about the suit
","More action suit mayhem. This time he has developed anxiety, which is joked about - fine, but a bit coarsely. This time it allows the movie to bring in a way of supercharging the brain's capacity for regeneration - a fantastical concept that is hard to get one's head around - but Rebecca Hall's character is just thrown away that doesn't make logical sense. Downey Jr is on top form with his mousetrap fast wit and familiar guile of a man with everything but some peace and quiet. The Iron Man does some amazing things but then it just all falls apart - which feels like the filmic equivalent of a humble brag.",6,0,1,1 August 2018
Deepwater Horizon," Blowout to tremendous visual effect. A tragic story
","An American action drama; Deepwater Horizon was the largest oil rig in the world and had been digging the deepest well in history beneath the Gulf of Mexico. The crew had been shutting down the exploratory Macondo Well, which potentially had a high yield of oil, when disaster struck.Patrick Morgan, who was an assistant driller on the Deepwater Horizon rig, said of the movie before it was released: 'I just don't want to see politics and political correctness and all that crap play into it.' The film focused on the tragedy of the explosion and honouring the 11 men who lost their lives.Despite some cumbersome schmaltz early on, the film settles on the story, precisely documenting the stages of the disaster. These scenes are accompanied by a fast dialogue that feels authentic with tossed around shorthand and lingo. Tension rises with clever editing as each step of mechanical failure is shown. The film achieves works very well on a special effects level, but as with many real-life films there are some inconsistencies in the factual telling which are worth noting.
The explosion came about due to years of cutting corners and not one careless mistake. The villain of the piece, BP Executive Donald Vidrine, played by John Malkovich in a gumbo-thick Louisiana drawl, in reality was not to blame. Vidrine spoke by phone to a BP engineer in Houston with regard to the problematic 'negative test' which proved fatal for the oil rig workers. Government investigations concluded that it was his BP superiors in Houston who were largely giving the orders for the crew to get work completed quicker on the well, which was 43 days behind schedule. BP's company man Vidrine certainly didn't expect that his decisions on the fateful day would lead to an inferno. The filmmakers could have found a better explanation for why intelligent people sometimes make such terrible decisions. Alas, this was an action movie with a story than needed someone to blame. In spite of this, several oversights and missteps were made by BP, and Halliburton - the American multinational corporation, and the Swiss company Transocean.
U.S. federal regulators who supervised drilling in the Gulf of Mexico signed off on Transoecean's plans at every stage, but this would not feature in the film's story and neither would the fact that all oil rigs were not fit for purpose.
The blowout preventer, which failed to stem the flow of oil when the wellhead erupted (widely used throughout the industry) was likely to be declared not fit for purpose.
All in all, an engrossing film and an affecting drama on human folly and obsession.",7,0,1,30 June 2018
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Casts its audience under a spell of childlike wonderment
","An American adventure; A story that singularly sums up a child's spirit, the dichotomy of youth and adulthood for what lies in possibility and optimism. It has a scintillating musical score and Spielberg's directing powers are in full bloom. Captivating and magical. Spielberg's response to the 'stalled space program'.",8,0,0,7 May 2018
Detroit," Provocative fact-based drama
","Detroit is a dramatisation of a tragic chapter from America's past, a provocative period piece. More than 40 people died during the so-called 'Detroit rebellion', most of them African Americans, many shot by the police or national guardsmen. The writers aimed to convey underlying truth. Any viewer aware that the film takes poetic licence will have some doubt what is true and what isn't.
It's an immersive experience which places the viewer at the heart of the unfolding chaos. The cinematography is brilliant. Vintage lenses are used to capture multi-angle digital footage interweaving seamlessly with archive material. However, there isn't an authenticity of dialogue, a charge that the screenwriter accepted. 
John Boyega gives a careful performance as the security guard who is caught between his race and his uniform. Will Poulter succeeds in characterising a corrupt, racist cop, 'Officer Krauss', a fictional character said to be a combination of a number of different officers from the Detroit Police Department who were present at the Algiers Motel that night.
Detroit isn't immune from its critics. It is told in a mode disengaged from the cultural and systemic forces in America that led to that kind of police brutality in 1967. Leaving the viewer feeling angry was the director's intention, and it succeeded.",7,0,1,28 June 2018
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Lampoon of public ministry and religious attitudes
","A British comedy film; A story about Roman-occupied Judea and a man who joins a revolutionary movement. His efforts to overthrow the established order are complicated when he is repeatedly mistaken for the Messiah, becoming a reluctant figure of worship. It's a shambling story with some very funny juvenile gags. The London accented vernacular of the characters in particular makes the subject matter wacky and funny. As an aside, the story set against a historical background of ancient Galilee, was seen as a comedy taboo and even blasphemous by some religious groups when it was released.",7,0,1,1 February 2019
Wind River," Gripping forensic Western. A 'Clarice Starling' for the 2010s
","An American drama; A story about an FBI agent and a game tracker who hunt a killer on the loose in the wintry vastness of Wyoming's Native American Country, where America and its strongly held uniformities are not always within easy reach.
A very satisfying drama. The main roles are very well acted by Renner and Olsen, their characters straightforward and grown up. No baloney dialogue. No ridiculous plot twists or male machismo to drive the momentum. Good people face their struggles with dignity in a forbidding setting, piercing cold and oppressive quiet. Conflict comes in the form of egregious acts while brutal honesty of the antagonists helps bring closure for those who pick up the pieces of the past.",7,0,1,17 June 2018
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," High octane revenge thriller prequel
","This fourth installment in the X-Men universe of films is a rip roaring visual spectacle with backstory to the Marvel hero, Wolverine. The action is dealt with competently and the kinesics and thrills are enjoyable, but ultimately this film falls short of its promise from earlier films about the origins of the character, instead it is a transparent story. A lot of the special effects are sub-standard and make the film cartoonish.",5,1,2,19 November 2018
X-Men," An accomplished superhero film
","An absorbing action film, faithful to the original Marvel comics. Wolverine is made the feature character but all the other characters get good exposition. It has a tight narrative but the story is quite straightforward. Given the interesting themes at work there isn't a great deal under the hood. A lot of the appeal is surface with good use of special effects and a good ensemble of acting talent.",6,0,0,18 November 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Daft, almost parodic but with its own special charm
","In a departure from the previous films in which Thor has featured, Hemsworth was required to reduce his stony-faced persona and stilted, prosaic delivery in favour of a more humanised, provincial persona. What worked well for the character as a marked contrast to the other heroes, is now conspicuous for adding at least dimension. It reduced his power overall in a film about a lofty Norse deity, but it is more fun for the masses. Also, Hiddleston and Hemsworth have marvellously prickly exchanges throughout.
More broadly, the film goes more for the sort of ironic humour that worked well for the Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool films, but it doesn't succeed quite as well here - except when Jeff Goldblum appears. 
There are improvements on Dark World in terms of the editing - we see much more of the splendour of the visual effects, especially the mystical planets, and the final sequence of the fiery giant is very impactful.
The film ramps up the talent stakes and theatrical absurdity with Cate Blanchett, but despite her best, melodramatic efforts we don't get the same kind of tension as we did of a banished heir to the throne returning home in the original.
The director injects some New Zealand personality which characterises the film but the plot feels papered over with slogans and it feels almost like pantomime in parts.",6,2,4,28 July 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Handsome liberal Western
","An American Western which occupies an area between dramatic action and comedy, but not action-comedy. The characters are unconventionally portrayed: they are lean and muscular cowboys but transform into low comedians part way through. But, for sheer entertainment it is superlative. It has handsome central performances from two handsome actors, who have great chemistry.
The cinematography is sumptuous with brilliant use of colour and shade to evoke feeling. The locations are magnificent. The editing, however, impairs the film slightly. The chase by the posse was overlong and the film drops into a ravine by the second act as a result, struggling to recover what it promised.
All in all, though, it has a fabulous musical score, cinematography and screenplay, all elements rewarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. It is very watchable stuff.",7,2,4,21 July 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Praise-hungry in tone but more centred on character than other Marvel films
","Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and learns to use his new powers - to climb and spin web - for the greater good, in case you didn't know the story. Notwithstanding the technical artistry, visual effects and a solid enough storyline, the lead character could be construed as an over-excited portrayal of the Peter Parker character that older audiences are accustomed to, for this is a teenage comedy. The main battle sequence does not stir and this is mainly due to the overuse of CGI which makes this look more like a cartoon than a live action movie.
All in all it feels like an inconsequential edition to the already marvellous film series. The set pieces are unremarkable but Holland's ability to capture the restless adolescent spirit who needs public affirmation is good. It will be a giddy treat for teenagers...but it will grate with some older viewers.",6,1,2,25 July 2018
The Town," Heist drama with a degree of Heat
","A smartly written and well cast drama set in a crime-ridden part of Boston, USA. There are some similarities with films like 'Heat' and 'Carlito's Way' but it holds its own with a rich story.
Some of the action sequences are sharp and orchestrated well but the final heist stretched believability. What starts out as a promising drama about the culture of crime and how it envelops generations in inner city communities gave it up for the stunts and gunfights and a bull-headed crime thriller",6,1,3,10 September 2018
Suicide Squad," 'Dirty Dozen' cartoon garishly coloured in
","Despite a good premise - a secret US government project to release the country's imprisoned supervillains to fight an enemy and all the danger of such an initiative - there's just not enough to care about. The tightness of the story set up at he beginning is offset by a clotted storyline that follows. It's a messy production. The characters gleam, and they have different skill sets for oncoming enemies which are amusing, but they have few redeeming features. Every superhero anti-hero film must have a convincing villain to create perspective too and easily toppled walking blackberries and a Disney witch don't cut it in today's marketplace. There's just not enough comedy to make it fun - that's the nub of it. However, the whole thing is saved somewhat by Margot Robbie's perky minx, Harley Quinn, who lit up the screen every time she appeared.",5,1,2,11 August 2018
Taxi Driver," Insomniac nightworker misfit with paranoid psychosis feeds his hate
",An American drama; A neo-noir about how a modern society of declining moral standards chips away at the sensibilities of the righteous and vulnerable with unpredictable results.,8,0,0,7 May 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," All American hero vs a secret cabal
","The unquenchable thirst for advancements in technology to solve potential conflicts is the theme. It's a conspiracy thriller about frightening new military apparatus and the ugly trade-offs for its use draws uneasy parallels for the audience in a post-9/11 world. Captain America is a welcome contrast to other Marvel characters - more depth and principled, and more humanlike 1940s hero amidst all the bright lights, bells and whistles of industrialised magic.",7,0,1,25 July 2018
Life of Pi," Graceful nature story bisected by spoon-fed theologism
","An American survival drama. An epic journey of adventure and discovery layered with messages about the true nature of God and storytelling, told in a fabulist style.
Very life-like special effects are used to good effect - critical in terms of telling a story about a young man and a connection with a fearsome Bengal tiger.
The film borders on brilliance because of the skilful storytelling at sea and marvellous cinematography. Illusion must be tightly linked to meaning and truth. Pleasingly, the special effects meet this criteria. Unfortunately, the film's narrative does not. The backstory about a writer who has writer's block serves as bathos, worsened by a self-important dialogue which produces some stilted acting at times. As a fairytale, it keeps nature 'red in tooth and claw' which is a refreshing aspect. Flash-forwards spoilt the tension created by Suraj Sharma's lead performance which was enchanting. All in all, it's a very good film. Its false note is a relentless articulation of thematic aims which failed to create enough subtext.",7,0,0,22 June 2018
Doctor Strange," Warrior of the astral plane in search of a plotline
","Exotic, mind bending and thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Among the terra firma Marvel characters we've had playboy technologists, soldiers and a scientist, so this one is a good contrast - the genius. Cumberbatch is well cast, smoothly encapsulating a genius and determined man who loses his dexterity and turns to the mystics to regain it. Strange manages to be theatrical even when he is learning not be theatrical. He has good support from Tilda Swinton, the mysterious Ancient One, played with charismatic blankness. 
On the downside, the plot is quite straightforward once the rules of the perspectives are understood we see little of the thought process of a character forced to rethink everything he knows and the nature of reality itself and so when he becomes emotional it feels a bit false.
But, as the Marvel series moves on in leaps and bounds this edition once again gives it a shot in the arm and an option for the next Avengers assembly.",7,1,1,27 July 2018
The Lost City of Z," An enticing quest but without clear narrative focus
","A film which hearkens back to classic exploration epics of the mid 20th Century. Charlie Hunnam gives a well measured performance as the British geographer, Army Major, and explorer Percy Fawcett. He journeys into the Amazon at the dawn of the 20th century and discovers evidence of a previously unknown, advanced civilization that may have once inhabited the region. He was aiming for a city he called 'Z'. The film centres on passion and determination and obsession and escape but also the losses suffered by leaving the home - his growing family and dutiful wife - in service of fantastical dreams. It is a biopic by numbers and this is a troublesome area because Fawcett and his story have many critics. Nonetheless it is a stately adventure despite the slow pacing.",6,1,1,11 March 2019
Ant-Man," Smaller in size and scale but no less creditible
","Paul Rudd as the would-be hero brings lots of verve and self-confidence and good comic timing to the role. Ant-Man as a film, in comparison to earlier releases in the Marvel canon, isn't nearly as tightly packed and bombastic and it doesn't exhibit the same kind of rapid, choreographed fighting but it is no lesser film for it. We enter the strange world of the miniscule - where science would present big problems according to shrinkage and theories like ontogenetic allometry - but pay no heed to instincts or science - this is an imaginative comic fantasy. Most of the fun is in the knowingness of its place in the Marvel series for many viewers and the unlikely hero quality of Ant-Man compared to the Avengers. The most touching aspect, though, is his hero like quality to his daughter. There is a feeling by the mid-point of the film that it is positioned to step up the gears and become a full epic treat but sadly that doesn't happen. Nonetheless it is a competent heist film and with good support from Michael Douglas as the troubled scientist.",6,0,0,26 July 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," Enhanced to the peak of human patriotism
","An American superhero adventure; A story about a puny but brave boy rejected for army service, who is transformed into being the ultimate soldier with special powers.
This is a sturdy, enjoyable action movie of cheesey charm. The pacing towards the end of the second act slows, and the tension drains, but up to then it is solid matinée fun Pleasingly, it avoids over-the-top seizure level CGI which creeps into the later Avenger series of films.",6,0,0,24 July 2018
Bird Box," The inexplicable eventually wears down this joyless drama
","A mysterious force decimates the world's population, only one thing is certain: if one sees it, one is compelled to commit suicide. 'Bird Box' is an apocalyptic film and bears some resemblance to 'A Quiet Place' in terms of the threat based on natural phenomena which drives the storyline. Unfortunately, despite its strong production values and good tension, this story allows melodrama to seep in and it loses direction in parts. Clearly, a memorable movie but it lacks emotion despite Bullock's creditable performance.",6,0,1,27 January 2019
Justice League," A clear and simple superhero ensemble
","With a touch of the 'The Magnificent Seven' in style, the superheroes quickly get down to business of joining forces and producing the goods. The bickering and bonding spike the film with humour but sadly there is something missing in the charisma of these characters. Batman cuts a reduced figure - Ben Affleck's muscularity and desperate demeanour is appealing but he is less impressive delivering the droll humour and at times he is dull in the exchanges. A film with such a fantastical setting demands alacrity from its characters. Cyborg offers little more than crabbiness and so we are left with Wonder Woman to add some sparkle and charisma. By the second act fatigue sets in, with repetition in the action sequences. It's a thinly-written story but there's plenty of good visual effects and Flash serves up some good one-liners.",6,2,2,9 August 2018
The Revenant," Man in the wilderness revenge drama
","DiCaprio gave an arresting performance as a Wyoming mountain man engaged in a US military expedition and is betrayed by a fellow soldier. It's a straightforward revenge drama heightened by a succession of escape sequences and survival thrills leading to a John Woo style ending. What is gained by the viewer being immersed in a time, place, and setting is lost to mumbling Southern drawl and stagy acting.
If there was a criticism of DiCaprio's performance it was he often overcommitted and his expressions were ungainly. The late Oliver Reed once recalled Peter Cushing's advice to him on how an actor should convey pain: Don't pull your face - suppression of pain is more dramatic.
All in all, it is a good action film with beautiful cinematography and stunning locations, but it is a forgettable film because the story is quite simplistic.",7,0,0,9 May 2018
The Shining," Ponderous and grandiose but effective for its stylized horror
","An American psychological horror; A story about a writer who takes a caretaking job at a remote mountain hotel in the off-season. His sanity is destroyed by visions, causing him to rampage and terrorise his wife and young son.
The film has a very effective setting for horror and the tension is slowly brought to a tautness. However, Jack Nicholson's manic and jumpy side was revealed too early for any mystery to take hold. The film also suffers for its slow pacing, and doesn't give enough for the audience to connect with any of the characters. That said, the film is very well photographed and many of the scenes can be savoured for their stylish composition.",7,2,3,5 November 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Spectactular special effects-laden sci-fi action film
","An American sci-fi thriller; The second film in the Terminator franchise used CGI technology to great effect and along with marvellous stunts and other visual effects helped make it a 'best in class' spectacle and a great genre film. It has an intriguing hero, a fierce heroine, and a young boy who is played with energy. One of the few false notes is that the story doesn't produce one single character to root for, and the ending doesn't make 'Sarah Connor' the hero prepared to terminate the machine herself despite everything.
The film has an interesting story, but to audiences it was a repeat premise of the Terminator (1984) - a boy has to be destroyed so that he doesn't grow up to be a revolutionary leader who would thwart the objective of an artificial intelligence computer network to bring about a nuclear war. Science paradoxes are rife - a higher intelligence in the future is the very end product of its time travelling mission so as to deduce in a femtosecond that it is futile logic.
That aside, we have a convincing central performance from its star once again, and stirring support from Linda Hamilton. Robert Patrick gives a menacing portrayal of the advanced machine out to stop the prevention of 'Judgment Day'. The pacing is good with some thought provoking narrative tight to the storyline which produces comical material in the Terminator-boy exchanges.
There are the usual car chases, explosions and fight scenes, all well done - and well directed in the big set pieces, but it is a film most memorable for the way the movie envisions a liquid metal human figure. Since technology has emerged in recent years able to mimic this effect in some small way makes Direcor James Cameron's vision quite remarkable.
Tension doesn't run quite as high as in the former film, where Arnold Schwarzenegger excelled in convincing us of a terrifying force and image, a diabolical killing machine seemingly incapable of being destroyed by humans, but it is in the special effects that this film soars to realise the vision of a high technology future and epic story of man vs thinking machine.",7,1,1,4 August 2018
The Battle of Algiers," Stalemate in the Casbah
","An Italian-Algerian historical war drama; This is a film based on true events - the war between France and the Algerian National Liberation Front from 1954 to 1962, which led to Algeria gaining its independence from France. An important decolonization war, it was a complex conflict characterized by guerrilla warfare, maquis fighting, and the use of torture by both sides.
The Battle of Algiers remains to this day an important film associated with Italian neo-realism cinema. A failure to win 'hearts and minds' it was considered as important material by some in the consideration of the outcome of a War on Terror in Iraq and perhaps even highly prescient.
It is a highly dramatic film shot in a documentary reel style with non-actors. While banned for five years in France it now is considered one of the great films of the 20th Century. Its achievement is not only its power of storyline and narrative but the effect of appearing as truth stylistically. No stock news footage is used which is astonishing for the realism it succeeded in depicting. Its value has increased from a historical point of view because those involved with the actual skirmishes and conflict will no doubt have seen the film differently in 1966.",8,2,3,2 July 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Strictly formulaic but plenty of surprise and thrills
","This fifth installment opens to one of the most thrilling pre-credit sequences of not just the film series but the action genre entire. There is no substitute for live action stunts and Cruise's determination to make the film do what it says on the tin - the impossible - is laudable. 
Simon Pegg is back in a larger supporting role as chatterbox analyst. He provides much of the humour, gluing Cruise's death defying escapes and scrapes together so things don't become too serious. Dressed-to-Kill British agent Rebecca Ferguson provides the athleticism and beauty and steals not only Cruise's gizmos but also some of his scenes. Sean H's villain is suitably quirky and menacing and guides the tension in climactic scenes.
There are a few false notes, namely that an Austran Chancellor seems less important than the British PM. The sequence at a Viennese opera resembles Quantum of Solace's right down to the detail..
All in all, a good action-adventure with thrilling motorcycle sequences and death defying aerial stunts, and on those elements its hard to say which is the better, Rogue Nation or its sequel.",7,0,0,28 July 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Avengers: UN mandated, or in violation of the prohibition of enhanced force
","Collateral damage comes home to roost for the Avengers. Some agree to being controlled others do not. It's an interesting, topical story direction and it's a more mature and substantive picture for it. 
This time all the fighting sequences have a little more purpose, showing the dynamics of their abilities, and while the set pieces go on too long, they are impressive. One drawback is tension dwindles because we are not convince why these allies are opposing each other with lethal intent. Also, what the producers gain in satisfying its growing audience, those unaccustomed to the Marvel Universe films will feel its overstuffed with characters.",7,1,3,26 July 2018
The Duchess," Late 18th century English noblewoman biopic
","Keira Knightly gives a reliably apposite performance in this costume drama, playing the Duchess of Devonshire with the charm and grace that made Georgiana Spencer so captivating, struggling in a loveless marriage, having to contend with her repression and loneliness. While the story chronicles the Duchess's life with vibrancy to show her hampered by the constraints of a rigid society, it struggles to overcome a lack of perspective.
Nevertheless, it is a handsome historical film, impeccably mounted, costumed, wigged and with striking locations and beautifully photographed and staged.",6,1,1,21 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A victory lap for a loyal audience
","An American action adventure and comic-book derived fantasy and the twenty-second film in the series of Marvel films. It is a special effects-driven story about a group of earth based superheroes who are living in the aftermath of a cataclysm which destroyed half of all living things in the universe, perpetrated by an alien supervillain called Thanos.The film is a direct follow up to 'Avengers: Infinity War' which showed some of their superhero colleagues killed in the disaster and deals with themes such as loss, revenge, and the attempt to put right past wrongs. It provides some exciting, entertaining action and, for at least those familiar with the previous films and characters, it is emotionally impactful. It has trademark witty humour and smart dialogue, but it lacks the exhilaration of 'Avengers Assemble' and lacks the high point humour of 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.By its second act it begins to feel predictable. It seeks gravitas but too many jokes destroy tension and suspense and a reliance on a well-worn time travel plot device makes for a messy past, present, and future time continuum.
Thanos is by far the best and most interesting character, providing subtlety as an archvillain. Thor was reduced from bombastic legend to a belaboured comic routine. Hulk failed to deliver any his trademark power. Much, as always, was left to Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man, as a focal point.
All in all, the film is entertaining, but it features too many characters which weakens the narrative.",6,0,1,5 May 2019
Remember the Titans," Highly charged Hallmark-type pigskin drama
","All sports drama films tend to hold their worth in their ending - win or lose and this dynamic must prevail. A comparison can be made to another 'true story' film, Gridiron Gang (2006). Both films are manipulative, set against orchestral and heart strings. Both have a social message, a rah rah rhetoric, and are well produced with their hearts in the right place.
The Titans of 1971, is a little more ham-fisted and predictable; the Kilpatrick Mustangs in 1990, as reforming criminals, is less hard hitting but less pretentious. But, intolerance and corruption lingers and intimidates at every turn in Remember the Titans which is why it is bound to have broader appeal.",7,0,1,27 May 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Popcorn entertainment that is straight, never rogue
","Mission Impossible 4 raised the stakes for assuming blockbuster status again after it had lost ground with a highly stylised last entry. The plot is quite implausible and the tension peters out a little in the third act - at least partly down to its frenetic pacing and bangs for your dollar. It was partially shot with IMAX cameras which helped to capture some death defying and vertigo inducing stunts for audiences. No special equipment was needed, unless you count Simon Pegg, to make this a funny film in parts too. Some of the special effects will be remembered as quite memorable for the series. Some SFX, such as the magnetic belt seem a little far-fetched and desultory. All in all, good adventure, a sense of fun wins the day and this is the signal producers need for them to issue another mission installment for us to choose to accept.",7,0,0,27 July 2018
Legend," Rise and fall of a diabolical villain pairing
","The twinset and burly this time was portrayed by just one performer, Tom Hardy. It was a laudable performance for the charisma he brought to the parts but all in all it is an underwhelming film. It lacked substance and, like The Krays (1990), it failed to achieve the sort of chills the infamous crime brothers were know for. Too much black humour and background music reduced the tension in the violent sequences. The film has a good supporting cast, however, so the film is watchable.",6,1,2,8 September 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A visual sensation with action occasionally lacking pulse
","An American action thriller; The Avengers assemble for a third time and the result is an astonishing and sensate extravaganza, ambitious in scale, imaginative in backdrops and attractive settings thanks to some wonderful CGI rendering.
The movie's biggest accolade should be reserved for the writers who had to satisfy avid followers of the film series by featuring and distilling so many outlandish characters from previous sagas and still make it entertaining. The result was a success - the heroes' egos jam up alongside each other beautifully.
Robert Downey Jr is on top form once more, and the Guardians of the Galaxy troop provide welcome comedic relief. Also, Thanos, is the most meaningful and personal antagonist of the series.
All in all it is an exciting epic, but with the dizzying array of heroes came a steady succession of overlong fighting sequences which occasionally lack a pulse and will become desensitising for some viewers who will say there's only so many times you can watch someone being kicked and punched through a wall.",6,0,3,5 August 2018
X-Men: The Last Stand," Comic book thrills but far less given over to character building
","This third film in the series is more on action, and a theme on acceptance and the morals of bio-engineering but lacks on substance. It delivers on a surface level the thrills required of a third film in a successful series. The magic of CGI is expertly carried out but there doesn't appear to be much at stake in terms of the drama, and fast editing reduces tension in the final act. Character development is dashed off in quick sketches while mutant powers are shown in all the lavish detail. All in all, it's entertaining enough.",5,0,1,18 November 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Full-hearted with remarkable performances
","An American coming-of-age romantic drama; A story set during a long, hot, early-80s summer near Lake Garda, Italy. A precocious teenager meets a handsome, charming grad student and for 6 weeks they discover a way to accommodate their feelings but with an inevitablity that is brought to any romance story.
This is a ravishing film, told with sophisticated sensuality, and concludes with supremely moving scenes. It has sumptuous settings, beautiful locations and the characters have mature and cultured mindsets which makes for impressive viewing.",8,4,9,20 July 2018
Hidden Figures," Logicians in an illogical setting
","An American drama; A story about African-American mathematicians working at NASA in the 1960s who were critical to the USA's success in the Space Race.
There are critics who've said that the film is a little heavy-handed in reminding the audience of the institutional culture which worked against women and African Americans at that time. But, it's a film intending to appeal to common sense, the difficulties people face, and by its style create an emotional response. If it feels heavy-handed then be reminded that this isn't a documentary about NASA; it isn't a film about African American political activists; it's a film with a theme - people work hard toward a common goal but are let down by ignorant people on the same side.
It's a film with big scope and big heart and strong central performances. It's also an interesting story and faithful to the real people and true events. There is an air of self-satisfaction, and it is straightforward without any surprises, and there is an unfinished element to the ending, but it is at the better end of a long series of quasi-hagiographic movies made over the last decade.",7,0,2,26 May 2018
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Passable story that cannot avoid an icky feel for adult viewers
","An undeniably haunting historical drama set in World War II. Although aimed at younger audiences it will offend some who think it creates a false equivalence between victims and perpetrators. Some may also think it should have avoided glossy melodrama for a tragedy about a Nazi family.
In terms of the performances, having the cast all speak in prim and proper English and modern dialect was distracting and unconvincing.
As a family film dealing with the Holocaust it doesn't fail to be arresting and the third act finale is powerful.",6,0,0,25 February 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," A wonderfully self-aware film about a rag-tag bunch of galaxian adventurers
",A bubblegum sci-fi comedy which has an anarchic feel. There is a wisp of Star Wars: A New Hope in the ether of the film and a healthy dose of wink-to-audience wit. Chris Pratt brings great charisma to the role and there is a good turn from David Bautista as the big brut who fails to understand metaphors. It's the absurdity that keeps it moving along - for a long film that is to the credit of the writers and director.,7,1,2,25 July 2018
The Evil Dead," Grim in good ways and bad
","An American horror; A story about five students staying in a remote cabin in Tennessee who unwittingly unleash evil spirits on the world after finding an ancient magical book. This cabin-in-the-woods story is a mix of suspense, camp, black comedy, and over-the-top gore by design. It has some inventiveness with camera angles and jump-scares, and its staging and setting is impressive. While the general workmanship is below par the 16mm film guage suits the grubby, low-budget intensity.
There isn't much depth to the story, and it has a predictable ending. It is crude in the way it shows women as objects of violence and there doesn't appear to be reasoning to the demonic forces, but the black comedy moments and tongue-in-cheek tone are good compensation. The best aspect is the sound design which helps sustains the atmosphere amidst some pretty grim acting.",6,1,6,13 October 2018
Mission: Impossible II," Mission remake: Notorious
","With a curiously similar plotline to Notorious (1946) this sequel offers much action and balletic violence and a familiar John Woo last act set piece. It's overblown, overcooked, and there is much less intrigue compared to the first mission. A descent in a vault has nowhere near as much tension as the first film. That said, Thandie Newton is winsome; Cruise is very capable as the spy trying to thwart a lethal disease outbreak; Dougray Scott is there to ensure the melodrama is maintained.",5,1,2,13 August 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," More on costume than on character but an innovative storyline
","An American action thriller; A noisy, compact actioner with a baffling plot but entertaining for its interesting notions of predestination and a story about scientists going too far with their knowledge.
Robert Downey Jr's mousetrap fast witty repartee is entertaining and there is good support from the likes of Paul Bettany this time round.
Those unacquainted with the film series will not get its full effect from the limited backstory. It runs a bit too fast in parts too, in particular the disposing of foes, which at times looks like tossing garbage in the bin rather than proper fight sequences involving people to engage with. World saving is also a well trodden storyline, but most of the film's budget (the second highest in film history) is up there on the screen and wonderful special effects to marvel.",6,0,0,25 July 2018
The Mountain II," Jingoistic but a robust action drama
","Oguz from Istanbul finds himself in deeper territory this time in the sequel to The Mountain. He's one of two soldiers who sign up for the Turkish special forces and after 5 years of training their first mission is rescuing a journalist from ISIS in Iraq. There are some great locations and beautiful landscapes.. It is overly sentimental and Turkish nationalism lies prominent but the combat scenes are very convincing. The ending is similar to Saving Private Ryan but it's thrilling enough for the viewer to not care. It's an interesting edition to the genre of war action given the tendency of American war cinema to portray U.S. special forces as the most elite, along with some others portraying British SAS and Israeli IDF too. Also interesting is the tone, whilst being nationalistic it has a message about justification for a Greater Turkey and a sense for the need to defend Turkish people living across arbitrarily drawn borders. Overall, a solid movie with some good acting and good action in the villages under heavy attack from ISIS.",6,5,12,8 July 2018
The Artist," A love letter to 1930s Hollywood
","A French comedy-drama; This story is a tribute to the magic of silent cinema. A joyous film with delightful performances and a beautiful visual style, bringing back the glamour and glitz of old Hollywood. It is extremely well cast with Dean Dujardin in Academy Award winning form as an older silent film star and a rising young actress as silent cinema falls out of fashion and is replaced by the 'talkies'. The costume design was also recognized by the Academy, and rightly so. The stage and set design is also impeccable with some surprising cinematography in street scenes that brilliantly captures 1930s Los Angeles.
The film used the soundtrack from 'Vertigo' which caused consternation in some quarters of the film industry, but this is not a film pupporting to be unaffected.",8,4,7,25 February 2019
Snowden," Story of a rise to infamy
","This story about one of the most important whistleblower cases in American history is filmed in grand settings to match the scale of the revelations.
It's a film about great courage but fails on suspense with the revelations. It's a story about get risk but fails to be provoking. Credit mostly goes to Gordon-Levitt's performance which is well observed and restrained. But there was some serious miscasting too: Nicolas Cage as a CIA IT teacher and Rhys Ifans, unconvincing as a CIA mentor.
Some sequences felt misplaced, such as the 90s film style training exercises. A viewer can suspend their belief in a character amidst great disagreements in the real world, but push it too far and they begin to question what was left out. 'Snowden' might have pushed too far on the brainiac narrative and hagiography whilst attempting to appeal to a maximum breadth of audience.",6,1,2,22 February 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Iridescent ecstasy... and a laugh a minute
","Highly anticipated sequel to the very amusing and colourful bubblegum sci-fi comedy adventure. This film captures the fun and enjoyment of the first film with ease. It has a photorealist style, eye-popping visual effects and fantastical kinetics which seem to suit this film more than any of the Marvel series films. Classic 70s retro songs are replayed in pleasing synchrony to the drama and action on screen. The story is a bit aimless for a while - flippant even, and the plot stalls a bit in the middle, and there isn't the same tension as the first film - but these are minor blemishes because there are entertaining performances and the pacing never feels forced.",6,0,0,27 July 2018
Thor," A Norse version of Crocodile Dundee with great bombast
","Thor goes at it hammer and tongs and forges some good spectacle for the viewer. Tom Hiddleston produces a good performance as the weaker of the two sons who claims power unduly when this is taken from the heir to Asgard kingdom. Chris Hemsworth makes a good fist of the role, convincing us of the Thunder God's alpha male traits. The visual effects of the distant realm are pleasingly colourful but a little distracting for their confection - we are expected to use our imagination for such a place but it looks rather computer generated rather than mystical. The fight scenes and sound are tremendous and there is great support and talent on offer, and underused I might add. How the film is held together depends on story and that is where the film disappears down the wormhole, so to speak. It is essentially a bridging of special effects sequences and not much is built in feeling for us to care about, certainly there is not enough feeling between the brothers for us to think Thor cares quite as much about his brother by the end. All the fantastical characters are not interesting. They're defined by their attributes, not their personalities. But, there is enough in the film to spark the imagination for it to be entertaining and quite funny.",6,0,0,22 July 2018
American Made," Amusing anti-hero or disgraced criminal, it's a movie with style
","American Made bears some similarity to movies like Air America, Catch Me If You Can, and Goodfellas, and other fashionable caper movies. It is a perfect vehicle for Tom Cruise, on whose charisma, smile, and appealing cockiness the movie hinges because we don't get a lot of psychological insight into the character, or learn why he was so determined to make more money than he could spend. Cruise played pilot Bruce Seale to distancing effect. This was well advised because the real protagonist was involved in some egregious criminal activities and the supporting roles don't have much stake in the story. But, this is a movie, and audiences can suspend their judgement when they see government agencies controlling its citizens with ultimatums. All in all, this is a story about one man - a citizen - at the centre of one of the most controversial political scandal of the early 1980s. That is at least interesting.",6,1,2,1 June 2018
Army of Darkness," A fuller story with all of the Evil Dead DNA that made it memorable
","There was never enough in The Evil Dead to credit it with being the best film just because the cabin-in-the-woods theme was an original one. The film was below par in too many aspects and it was not much of a story, and not the first to feature flesh-eating demons. And, although the second instalment was entertaining and creditable, the third in the series proves the point that there is no substitute for a good story and high production values. Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness is funny, well acted, consistent pacing throughout, and raises the bar once more and still retains all of the familiar DNA in gore, slapstick humour and good all round entertainment. Containing less of the blood soaked insanity of the previous two instalments, Army of Darkness is more of a cartoonish sword-and-sorcery fantasy, albeit one with some imaginative monsters and special effects, with a horror element attached to it.",6,2,3,13 October 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Lavishness on the rails
","Death aboard an opulent train service, and everyone among the eclectic array of first-class passengers is a suspect. Gladly, there is still some mystery for those who saw the 1974 film version and/or those familiar with the genre. Sadly, no character worked hard enough to gain our sympathy or empathy to excuse the conclusion. Stylistically, it was pleasing but there are some questionable decisions on camerawork that don't seem to create tension or make a point. Brannagh's meticulous preparation paid off, but it loses steam by the time of the big reveal.",6,0,1,19 June 2018
X-Men: First Class," X-Men extravaganza but somewhat overcooked
","This episode of the story of the X-Men is a prequel which tells the story of how the X-Men originally came together. The character development is good and the cast is impressive, though with considerably less resemblance to the personalities defined by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Professor X and Magneto. It uses guile, and a swift script to interpolate on actual history to give gravitas to the future storyline. The false notes are that there are far too many mutants which often detracts from the storyline. The competitive advantages of some characters make them visibly more like demigods than as mutants, which reduces the overall tension. The combat, therefore, designed for exaltation mostly ends up feeling far-fetched.",6,0,1,20 November 2018
The Wolverine," Wolverine's character more fully rounded
","The sixth installment in the X-Men series of films is a rousing story. It has wonderful locations, breathtakingly suspenseful action sequences, exquisite production and costume design and colorful characters. With Hugh Jackman at the helm we have an action star with charisma, presence, muscularity and vulnerability too which adds a great deal more tension to proceedings than any of the previous films. As with many other superhero films the fighting sequences dominate but here they mostly avoid redundancy as the story flows.",6,0,0,21 November 2018
Black Panther," Brilliant spectacle. Its story thrust was left to viewer's imagination
","An American action film; A story about a new ruler of a hidden African nation who faces a challenge for his throne. Assisted by his tribe's forces and a CIA agent, the new King is soon locked in a life-or-death struggle for the future of the world. This is a film which has multiple themes including isolationism vs threat of openness, and the notion of what wealthy nations owe to the poor and oppressed.
Few Marvel films work better tonally than this. The battle action sequences, which overcrowed the story in the other films in the Marvel series, have more purpose here. By no means does 'Black Panther' transcend the action genre but it certainly embraces it in a skilful way. It has a plentiful array of costumes, inspiring set design, and different cultural elements which are well-observed and impressively rendered using CGI which provide a beautiful backdrop of a near idyll.
However, the characters are not easily distinguishable from the beauty and sweeping majesty of the stage backcloth and it is impeded by the studio's anodyne dialogue which feels like design-by-committee. T'Challa, the King, is po-faced and no more interesting for what he says than Captain America and Thor who also lack dimension. Martin Freeman's character was smooth-talking but drab and with a turn of phrase of a freshman, not an airman. In contrast, Michael B. Jordan's villain ignited the film giving it a spring in its step, while Andy Serkis gave us a character of some verve albeit brief.
All in all, it looks fabulous, but its thematic assertions were feint.",6,0,2,29 July 2018
Mother!," Atmospheric drama engulfed by outrageous surrealism
","Mother! is a phantasmagorical horror about a self-centred writer, and his young homemaker housewife, who live in seclusion in the countryside. The film progresses by way of a home invasion with the husband's consent. It succeeds for an hour as a kind of filmic explication of anxiety and dismay, builds good tension and atmosphere. There is a human centre which sadly vanishes when further layers are added: abuse, black comedy, surrealism, and in the end it is either perceived as unwieldy and obtusely indulgent, as I found it, or enjoyable for its sheer violation of usual conventions. There isn't an onscreen chemistry between Jarvier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence - they are not believable as a couple, but each perform well, particularly Lawrence who does well as the shrinking violet, playing against type. All in all, Mother! is a thought-provoking and original story about mysogynystic violence but it hould have left black humour at the door.",6,0,0,23 June 2018
Speed," Masterly precision of action storytelling
","An American action thriller about an LAPD cop who tries to rescue civilians on a city bus rigged with a bomb programmed to explode if the bus slows down below 50 mph. There are breathtaking aerial shots, mind-boggling stunts, and camera positioning which puts the audience right at the centre of the action. The film won two Academy Awards for Sound production. Sandra Bullock gives very good support with a twinkle in her eye and Dennis Hopper is very well cast as the diabolical villain. Keanu Reeves gives a corny but commanding performance.
While on the one hand it's a film which centres on action, foregoing character development or personality, it's a terrific adventure and embodies the perils and thrills of speed. One of the strongest action films of the 1990s.",7,6,6,27 March 2019
Son of Saul," A man's struggle for human decency in a living hell
","A Hungarian Sonderkommando (with only months to live because his class of worker knew too much about camp crimes) discovers the body of his son and must choose between a clandestine uprising and a proper Jewish burial for his son.
This Hungarian film is a grimly intense yet rewarding and unforgettable viewing experience set during World War II in a death camp. The storytelling mastery approximates a haunting sensory journey. The camerawork means the viewer immerses themselves in the horror observing at close hand the sickening conditions they had to endure. It is quite possibly the most harrowing film about the Holocaust because of the camera techniques used.",7,0,1,24 February 2019
X2: X-Men United," A sequel superior in scale but foregoes character development
","This sequel to X-Men is brash, bigger in scale, sexy, with spectacular action scenes powered by special effects. But, a confused plot, and less on character development, it ends up less balanced than the original. There is none of the daring and originality, for example the opening scene of the first film.",6,0,0,18 November 2018
Thor: The Dark World," The hammer fell to sometimes pounding boredom
","The second instalment of the adventures of Thor is something of a let down comparatively. The first film had some interesting backstory but this time we are weighed down by over-explanation, a convoluted plot, and editing which is too fast for the viewer to enjoy the splendourous CGI worlds artists have gone to so much trouble of imagining. This time the characters are in London and the plot shifts with preposterous coincidence to London too, and then used as a finale for supposedly the end of the universe. Its tongue-in-cheek, to which I will give it credit, but the main problem is the feeling that Thor is not vulnerable enough that he is not going to win the day. It's an overwrought production, engaging only by its pounding music and incessant battle scenes and spacecraft kinetics. It's good fair but when you've seen the 'high striker' a couple of times at the fair you need something new and Thor lacks dimension when he's the lead character expected to carry the whole film without much new backstory extended to him. There is some saviour and that is, once again, Tom Hiddleston in wide-eyed mania who gave us an interesting villain with perfectly pronounced threats with a trace of unsettling sibilance.",5,0,1,23 July 2018
The Truman Show," 'On the air. Unaware'
","An American satirical sci-fi fantasy; This is fabulously thought provoking and prescient of a future celebrity culture. Jim Carey is well cast and the film has expert direction from auteur Peter Weir. The themes are 1) how far is one prepared to go to break out of one's world view, and 2) what are the boundaries of broadcast sensibilities for an audience seeking the truth.",8,0,0,7 May 2018
Annihilation," Visually impressive but narratively stunted
","This sci-fi mystery provides iridescent visual wonders and a visceral feel. It is an impressively ambitious exploration of challenging themes such as genetic mutation and deconstructionism.
A good performance from Natalie Portman helps to keep the story interesting and Jennifer Jason Leigh's return to the screen is impressive - her part as the psychologist was good casting.
The strange mind-bending mystery, and the creatures and action along the way keep up the tension quite well but its the production design and cinematography that sustains the viewer's interest. The film drops a notch by the end because the story is left unresolved - a vagueness that either is purposively reserved for a sequel, or worse - a lack of imagination.",6,1,2,3 February 2019
The Breakfast Club," Entertaining youth flick of grievances, self-pitying and hard-hitting home truths
","An American comedy-drama; A story about five teenagers who are thrown together for Saturday morning detention.
This counter-culture film has a theme about American adolescence and finding common ground. It uses funny scenes to ridicule pesky authority figures and deals with the reaction of teenagers who are put on pedastals, stereotyped, struggling to keep to established social constructs in the home and in school. It has a teen film formula and uses clichÃ©s to produce pathos. Enjoyable aspects like a dance sequence is incongruous for where the story had got to, and a single setting meant the performances sometimes came across a little forced. The stereotype that was created for the character, Bender, was never fully deconstructed so there was an uneven feeling about him by the end.
The soundtrack and songs belonging to that time period blend very well with memories for a present generation of forty year-olds.",7,0,0,20 July 2018
Evil Dead II," Imaginative low budget comedy horror
","A consistently lively, ghoulish horror film with plenty of slapstick comedy and entertaining special effects. 'Evil Dead' films have never been particularly scary. It's more about black humour, which naturally arises from horrific events taken to extremes, and it does it well. The film has higher production values than the previous installment and this time we get a creditable performance from Bruce Campbell, who is riveting in is over-expression and camped up characterisation. There really is not much story to tell and some sequences rest on comic value entirely. It's a rampant film, non-stop action and you'll never forget it once you've seen it.",5,0,2,13 October 2018
