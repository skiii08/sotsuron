Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace
","This Episode I of the Star Wars Saga is a very good one. In my opinion is as good as the other 3 Episodes. Sometimes I put it in the second place of my favorite and other timer in the last one. My favorite Episode is the VI Return of the Jedi. I am not going to mention why, because this is from Episode I The Phantom Menace and not from Episode VI. Well, in the movie (SW EP I TPM) almost all is ok. There is a very good group of actors. I liked the performance of Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson for the best. But Jake Lloyd and Ahmed Best were enjoyable too. All the actors were enjoyable. The story was very good. It was a good start for the whole Saga. The way Palpatine is gaining power, the way Anakin went to be trained by Obi-Wan, the way in which Palpatine hides in the shape of Darth Sidious, the Trade Federation, the way C-3PO and R2D2 joined each other, etc. Plot was good too. The only bad thing I found were some dialogues, that were made for us to laugh but were not appropriated for the moment. But for the rest, all was perfect. Special Effects were so great, I loved them. But I am not a Star Wars fan because of the special effects only, I love the story of the Star Wars Saga. The costumes of Queen Amidala were so beautiful (the movie will win an Oscar for Costume Design for sure!). I liked Jar Jar Binks, I didn't found him a bad character, or a stupid guy or anything bad. And he's form of speaking was cool. Ohh, and the music performance was perfect. I loved it a lot. Dues of the Fates and the Augie's Great Municipal Band were perfect scores. John Williams is the best, he's the King of music scoring. (He deserves the next Oscar for Best Song!) Well, STAR WARS EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE is a great movie, a STAR WARS movie. I really liked it and I enjoyed it a lot. I cried when Anakin went with Qui-Gon and left his mommy, and when Qui-Gon died. Also at the beginning and at the ending. I shall recommend this movie to anyone who loves good movies. I give a 9 out of 10 to the movie. And... May the Force be with us.",8,0,0,31 October 1999
Cast Away," I just can say: wow!
","Robert Zemeckis did it again! He never stops to impress me! Man, this guy is talented! What a great director.And what a great film! I loved this movie. I laughed, I cried, and I enjoyed the film.Certainly one of my favorite movies of the year. My second favorite, because Erin Brockovich is still my fave.But man, this film was great. Very intelligent, with great acting, funny stuff, and lots of drama.I loved Wilson! The interaction between Tom Hanks and Wilson was perfect. I cried when he got lost. I cried a lot! And I still can't believe it. I cried for a volleyball!!!The ending of the film wasn't bad! It was great!!! The wings, all the symbolism. Everything! I rate this film with 10 stars.Oh, and the music! Even though most of the film passed out with no music, the moments with music were great! I don't know yet who was the composer for this film, but he did his best! And excellent job.What else? I don't know what else to say... Oh, I kept crying even when the film was already finished. I was walking with my mom to the car, and I was crying.One more thing, the scene of the airplane crash was great! Wicked, horrible, terrific! Arrrggghhh, I loved this film!One of the years best. I hope it gets nominated for the Oscars. I guess we'll have to wait and see.",9,0,0,10 January 2001
The Exorcist," I just saw the movie: The Version You've Never Seen, that is.
","OMG! I just saw the movie. The movie opened here like 1 or 2 weeks ago, and I had no time to go and see it, but for my luck, it was in Blockbuster for rent. So I rented it. And I saw it. Just logged on after seeing it. You know, I had just seen this movie 1 time in my life before tonight. Now it's been 2 times. The first time I saw it, I think I didn't pay too much attention to the movie, and I didn't like it that much. Boy, this time I loved it! This is a great movie, and one of my favorites now. I loved it! I didn't see anything wrong with the extra time, the sound was as good as the first time, but better of course. No wonder why it won the Oscar for Best Sound. Again, great movie. The movie isn't really scary, but it keeps you in suspense, with your eyes wide open. Great acting too. Everybody gave a good performance in this movie. Well, that's all I have to say for now.",10,0,1,18 January 2001
