The Perks of Being a Wallflower," An alright movie I guess...
","Not bad but by no means brilliant.It starts off tame enough but then it all goes a bit dark with the abuse thing. Some decent scenes throughout the movie but for me it really is still lacking something. I would have been 14/15 years old myself in 1991/92 when this movie was supposedly set. I certainly don't remember any of that carry on. Sure, the were different people into different things at school but the way their outside school life was portrayed with lavish parties and well mannered kids was, for me, unrealistic. But then again I'm not American. And if there is any hint of realism in this movie then I'm pretty glad I ain't.Check out weird science.",4,3,6,25 January 2013
Man of Steel," Pure ballacks wee lad...
","Right, lets get it out in the open - 'junk'. This is how I would refer to this piece of celluloid. Don't believe the fevered, phony, and I'm sure expensive, hype surrounding this movie. It all start's dark enough in terms of how 'he' came to be in regard to atmosphere but sure enough within 15mins we are overwhelmed with pointless CGI that can't quite cut it. When will these people realise that technology, or maybe it's just the way they are utilising it, doesn't work in a realistic manner yet? The winged 'flying beast' looks worse than something I remember in 'Never Ending Story'. Pathetic. All joking aside though, if you watch this film and actually think it is dark, edgy and charismatic somehow then do us a favour and borrow a gun or suck on a tailpipe and end your worthless existence. Seriously, do. What a waste of $250 million or whatever it cost. It could of been better spent on educating children on how to read and write before they too end up like their parents living and working an unfulfilled life. Oh wait a second, that's you...",2,5,10,9 July 2013
The Revenant," Disappointng..
","So yes the cinematography is excellent. Lubezki (the main camera man) has drawn on all his experience from his work with director Terence Malik - not a static shot to be noticed. However, and it is a big HOWEVER, the actual screenplay itself I feel is where the movie is let down big time. I just frankly feel that the story asks too much of the viewer. As per Blake Snyders 'double mumbo jumbo' rule (viewers can only accept one piece of magic per film) Iñárritu expects us to believe three:1. Glass survives a bear mauling (fair enough)2. Glass survives a bear mauling AND a post-icy river swim in sub zero temperatures with no pneumonia3. Glass survives a bear mauling AND a post-icy river swim in sub zero temperatures with no pneumonia AND a serious jump off a cliff on horse backI'm sorry but I find this absolute nonsense. Why go to such great lengths in a film to try to show grit and realism with your cinematography and characters etc, only to spoil it by adding in some balls that the Hollywood exec thought 'I think they'll buy it...' ?Poor show me thinks.",5,50,122,30 December 2015
