Alien 3," A misguided and misinterpreted, yet still impressive film.
","The issues with this movie that have been raised are more than valid. The acting is brilliant from most of the actors, such as Pete Postlethwaite, however some of the actors - a very small amount - could be accused of overacting. The story is harsh and difficult to view, and the film was ravaged by money hungry, franchise desperate producers. Add to that the decent, yet seemingly unneeded special effects, we are given a film with many flaws. And yet, with all that, Alien 3 has a brilliant nasty, uncaring tone, a tone that matches the animalistic nature of all of the characters. And the acclaimed British actors used bounce perfectly off of the previously namely American actors. Sigourney Weaver is brilliant, and the sets are truly incredible. Add to that the cinematography? Wow. Far from flawless, and someone who isn't interested in anything more than viewing films may not like it - totally understandable. But, if you look a little deeper, you may find it enjoyable if not extremely good, but it's all about perspective. Not for everyone, but it's worth a watch. I give it an 8 out of 10, but that's just me.",8,2,2,7 March 2014
Fight Club," My favourite film ever, never to be topped
","When i watched this film i nearly collapsed. It's the greatest film EVER. It's violent, brutal, funny, silly, dark and disturbing, all in one little package. Though it's long and sometimes films can lose it in there length it carried on being all it's cracked up to be until the ending. Story= A man with a sleeping disorder goes to clubs about disability's, (cancer etc.) though he didn't have any of them, to help him have a good nights sleep. But when his condo is blown up he goes to live with a man he met on a plane, a man he'd only met once. Outside a bar he punches the man on his will and they start brawling. Afterwards they like fighting (and it helps his sleep) so they carry on to set up 'Fight Club', unknowing of what it'd lead to. 10/10 Acting= The acting is brilliant. Enough said. 10/10 Humour= Funny bits include lines, actions, looks, everything. A lot of the film makes you laugh without being a comedy, brilliant. 10/10Overall a film that is perfect and truly the greatest film ever made.",10,1,3,16 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," A 'modern' version of about 10 minutes of film.
","Terminator Salvation is at least, in its simplest sense, an interesting film, and one that is certainly, and very, watchable. It is created from, in a tonal sense, about 10-15 minutes of footage from the classic original Terminator. That is all the viewers of the Terminator films (not the series which I never viewed) have really seen of the war in the future. It was dark, bleak, only really seen at night and consisted of a feeble human race fighting against a larger robot race. Yet, Terminator Salvation is a film that is set entirely in this world. And it is an amazing world to behold. If the entire review was just about the world shown - or hell, just about the experience of watching it, then this film would be an instant classic. It changes up the world seen previously, yet portrays it, in a way, exactly how Terminator explained it to be - hell. But we can't just look at it by the world, we have to sum it by all of its parts. And some are pretty faulty. For example, it was written by the writers of the excellent David Fincher movie 'The Game'. They also wrote the not so excellent 'Catwoman'. Yeah. The story is good, but leaves a huge amount to be desired. The acting is good, but just good. Not excellent. People talk, and are believable, but only just believable enough to pass. The set pieces are pretty incredible at points, and provide some good, tense action. Plus, the film itself is super entertaining on a basic brain-switching-off level. It has many good points, and a few bad. It isn't perfect, but lets be fair, it wasn't meant to be. Hell, the guy's name is 'McG'. He wasn't here to make a statement about life and machines and what makes us human or any of that, and if he was, that was a failure. He was here to entertain and man oh man did he get that right. If you're stubborn and cannot flex your views on Terminator and what you think it 'should' be based on the first two amazing movies, then you won't like this movie. But you knew that. But if you go in with an open mind, then maybe, just maybe, you might even enjoy yourself.",7,0,1,8 March 2014
U-571," Perfect
","I've heard people talking about this film in a bad way, like as it's American it's terrible. Films do not need to be perfectly like the actual war! It's just 100 and something minutes to keep you on suspense with twists and turns, that's is the basic summary of a film. I love this film and it's definitely worth watching whether or not your a WWII buff. Also, it's a very action a suspense based film and that builds around it, turning it into something that you turn on thinking your not going to get through it but then getting through the whole film, whether or not you've seen it which is a feat that some films can't reach.",7,6,16,15 August 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," Perfect in every single way
","So, i watched this film thinking it'd be pretty good. Was i wrong. It wasn't good, nor was it bad-it was perfect. It's hard to get a perfect film but i think this is a film that if you don't watch before you die your crazy. The story is an adaption of Stephen King's (when you hear that name you know it's going to be good) novel by the same name. It's about a prisoner put in jail for life for the wrong crime. He makes friends, people die, life moves on through his hardship until the chance to escape walks along. Overall 10/10, you could describe it with any word it'd still be awesome. Acting - Morgan Freeman was 10/10 in this, and through a lot of his movies. Tim Robbins made a character that was calm and cool and scared and worried etc. and could change through his emotions in a heartbeat. 10/10I'll stop it there, but that's all you need to know. It deserves to be top and if you don't think so cast your opinions because until then it'll just keep being perfect.",10,0,0,16 August 2009
