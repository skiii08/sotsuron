50 First Dates," The Best Romantic Comedy I've Ever Seen!
","One thing is for sure, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have the most realistic and genuine chemistry with each other that I have ever seen. Thinking back to all of the movies that I have seen, I have to say that this one takes the top as far as romantic comedys go. To all of the critics out there who thought the movie was stupid, I really think you should take a minute and ponder the excellence of the two main actors in the movie and realize just how truly fantastic they both really are. It truly was the best movie I have seen in a long time. The greatest thing about it was that it had a little bit of everything in it. There was comedy, romance, drama, and downright seriousness to the whole movie. When we see that Adam Sandler can really have a heart of gold and that Drew Barrymore can be as truly sensitive as she was in the movie, it really makes us realize that acting from the heart is the best way to go. I have seen this movie five times and each time that I watch it, I get that much more attatched to it. When it comes out on video, one can be rest assured that I will own at least one copy in both VHS and DVD of it. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have become my two most favorite actors. I hope with all of my heart that they are in another movie together soon!",Null,0,0,25 February 2004
