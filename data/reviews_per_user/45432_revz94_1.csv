The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Such an amazing movie!!!!!
","I completely loved this film, the cast was awesome, great acting and directing, actually this is easily one of the best book adaptations I've seen. I feel connected to the story in so many ways, and this movie gave me a similar feeling the book did, which is awesome. What bothers me is the low earnings of the movie, according to box office mojo 28 million dollars worldwide. I find this really unfair, considering all the awful films that are a grossing success and this amazing piece of art pass by without any glory,the writer an director as well as the actors deserve it if you haven't seen the film go watch it immediately.",10,3,7,14 January 2013
