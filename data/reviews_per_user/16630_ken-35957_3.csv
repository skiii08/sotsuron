War Dogs," Why greed is not so good
","At a deeper level, the story is about how short sighted, and expensive, greed can be. Efraim Diveroli forgets that not paying is the fastest way to end in trouble, and that's exactly what happens to him - over and over again. The morale of the story - pay you way - it's the cheapest path and the best one if you want to keep what you have. You'll see how the greed creeps through when the biggest contract he ever made under bidded all others by about 20%. The greed bug bites hard and his outburst heralds what is to become of his 'best friend' and partner.The darker side to Efraim's character, which allows him to go undetected, is his ability to be 'anyone someone else wants him to be' - from a high school best friend, to a like-minded investor, the list goes on. It's an eye opening film on how slick some operators can be.Overall, an excellent film. Well paced, interesting and highly entertaining.",8,0,0,3 September 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," Film Meaning Review - Secret Life of Pets
","By Ken Standfield, Film Meaning Specialist. Film Review. September 9th, 2016Movies are entertaining because they have meaning. That meaning has the power to change our perception, how we view others and sometimes our very lives. We watch films for their meaning. Yet so often, reviews are about scripts, actors, sets, special effects, music and other more tangible parts of the film. Yet, it is the meaning, that connects an audience with a film and makes it immortal or a failure. As a Film Meaning Specialist, my job is to share the different meanings and morals of a film so audiences can get more value from the films they watch.The Secret Life of Pets is a film literally filled with meaning. We spotted 20 meanings, and there are more. In this film review, there are no spoilers.Message 1: Jealousy happens when supply is limited. Moral: When two fight over the full attention of a 3rd party, things get ugly, competition occurs and aggression follows.Message 2: Size and strength gives power, temporarily. Moral: The stronger opponent can be fierce and intimidating until they are out- thought and out-positioned by a more intelligent rival. People are intelligent and will find a way to use size and strength against you.Message 3: The one in charge is in charge, temporarily. Moral: A dominant individual who uses fear to punish those around them, will control others for a time, but not forever. Seek cooperation and understanding to avoid retribution.Message 4: Done by accident or on purpose? Moral: A goal achieved by accident counts as much as a goal achieved by planning and deliberate thought. If an accident gives the right outcome, pursue it.Message 5: The threat of punishment gives you power over others, temporarily. Moral: A weaker party can control a stronger party through the threat of punishment. However, when abused, the stronger party will reassert their dominance.Message 6: Abuse creates revenge. Moral: Abusing and mistreating others will eventually cause revenge.Message 7: Strength in numbers. Moral: Seemingly weak parties become strong when they cooperate together. If you are weak, increase your followers.Message 8: Similarity creates connection. Moral: Common ground (shared experiences) can be used to create a bond with hostile parties. Find the similarities to eliminate the differences.Message 9: Desperate people lie. Moral: Desperate people lie to avoid punishment.Message 10: Emotional connection energises. Moral: To get help an emotional bond and emotional connection needs to exist. The stronger the bond, the more help that is freely given.Message 11: Acting against instincts is difficult, but possible. Moral: Instinctive reactions can be managed, but it is difficult and a struggle â€“ until new habits form.Message 12: Connection creates loyalty. Moral: To have loyalty, you must be first emotionally connected. Likewise, an emotional connection creates loyalty.Message 13: Lies have no detail. Moral: Continue to ask for ever increasing detail when confronted with a story you think is a lie. Lies have no detail, so the story will change over time, or clearly show itself as false.Message 14: Lies have an expiration date. Moral: The truth cannot be buried. Lies are temporary and always uncovered.Message 15: Mutual enemies create cooperation. Moral: My enemy's enemy is my friend. We see this message play out in global politics all the time. Sometimes, your enemy's enemy becomes your enemy again. Be careful with enemies.Message 16: Know the one who knows as many people as possible. Moral: To get to your goal sometimes you need help. Find the one with highest access to information and knowledge to help you get what you need.Message 17: Knowledge is more powerful than strength. Moral: Handicaps when ignored and when intelligence and knowledge are leveraged are no longer handicaps. Proof: Stephen Hawkins.Message 18: Don't think negatively, get the facts. Moral: Negative thinking prevents the truth being known and creates inactivity and stagnation. Keep moving. Question the negative thought and get the facts. Good or bad, the outcome is not important, getting the facts is the outcome.Message 19: We stall to avoid pain. 'Let's have a long talk about why you think I am stalling.' So cute, but so powerful a message. Moral: Avoidance of pain slows or stops you from finding the facts. Ignore negative voices and focus on getting the facts, whatever they are.Message 20: The power of love is the strongest force in the universe. Moral: Love gives life meaning and purpose. To get love, give love. Dogs are especially gifted at giving love.We hope you have found these messages of value.Ken Standfield is a film meaning specialist who explores and shares the ideas, concepts, morals and messages in films to assist audiences get the maximum value possible out of the investment they make in watching movies.

Sully," Sully - Film meaning specialist review
","Film Meaning Specialists focus on 'meaning' or the 'moral in the story'. Good films typically have high levels of meaning for audiences. Our job is to extract that meaning out so you get as much value from watching a film as possible.We identified 11 core meanings within Sully. Some messages are more significant than others, but all of them worth commenting on.** Spoiler Alert: Film meanings require a description of the plot and film outcomes to contextualise. If you want to be surprised by a film, read this after a film. If you want to be enlightened by a film, read it before watching it. **Message #1: Distraction is dangerousAt the start of the film, Sully is jogging, his mind full of thoughts and concerns. He is almost killed (run over) by a cab (taxi) driver. He is unharmed, but it could have been a serious accident. In 'Me Before You', the central character crossed the road distracted and was hit by a motorcycle. He ended up disabled and flew to Europe to commit assisted suicide. Moral: When you are distracted you are in danger. Pay attention.Message #2: Sensational stories create overwhelming media attentionSully landing safely on water with none of the 155 in the plane dying was unheard of. In fact, before the landing, it's obvious that water landings mean death to everyone on the plane. The sensational nature of this story creates media attention that is overwhelming for Sully and his family. The degree of attention increases as time progresses. Moral: Once in the media spotlight for something significantly newsworthy, expect the spotlight to brighten to overwhelming levels.Message 3: Keep going and maintain focusSully has a flashback to when he was young. He receives sage advice, 'Never forget that no matter what is happening fly the air plane.' Moral: No matter how problematic things get, keep focus on what you are doing, and keep going. Don't panic, get distracted or give up. Don't stop. Keep going.Message 4: Life's work at risk from 1 actionIf Sully was investigated and found negligent, it would mean that his consulting business and his profession as a pilot would be over. Not only that he would lose his pension and be fired immediately. Moral: Sometimes we face events that could destroy our future. See what happens. It may not be as bad as you think.Message 5: Be committedSully was the last off the plane, painstakingly checking that everyone was safely evacuated. Moral: Commitment is doing your job from the start to the finish without gaps in between.Message 6: Are all 155 accounted for?Sully needed to know all 155 were safe as survivors were taken by multiple ferries to multiple locations. Moral: Know what you are accountable for.Message 7: Last one on the rescue boatSully was the last one on the rescue boat due to his commitment (Message 5) and accountability (Message 6). Moral: When you are a leader commitment and accountability are how you show leadership.Message 8: When facing death, the 1st call is to familyWhen people thought they were going to die they reached out to their families and loved ones. They didn't call their work and say they may not be in tomorrow. Moral: What really matters becomes obvious in times of crisis but is often ignored in good times. Reach out and let the ones you love know them before a crisis. Message 9: Question the evidenceA brilliant message was how Sully refuted 'evidence' that if left unchallenged would have seen his life fall to pieces (Message 4). He questioned the evidence, found it lacking for numerous reasons and created reasonable doubt. His attack on the validity of the evidence saved his career. Moral: When people use evidence against you, refute it based on logic, fairness and reasonableness.Message 10: Exert control: I need a quick breakSully exerted control. In a room full of what looked to be 100 people where he was being questioned in an adversarial way. He said, 'I need a quick break' and left the room with his copilot. He was letting the gravity and weight of the refuted evidence impact the people judging him. It was a masterful stroke of negotiating. Moral: In an adversarial encounter find a way to take control and slow down or stop the attacking side's momentum.Message 11: Share creditAt the end of the film Sully is found to have acted in with the highest possible skills levels. A previously adversarial opponent, becomes a supporter and praises Sully as the only reason that the 155 people lived. Sully refutes that and shares all the credit with his co-pilot, the stewardesses, the crew, the many rescuers and more. Moral: Victory, nor defeat, is never ours alone. Many people are involved. Share credit lavishly - because that is real.Ken Standfield is a film meaning specialist who explores and shares the ideas, concepts, morals and messages in films to assist audiences get the maximum value possible out of the investment they make in watching movies.
