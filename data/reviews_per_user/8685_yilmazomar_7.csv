Casablanca," Beginning of The Golden Age of Hollywood
","The sets, costumes and designs were absolutely gorgeous. Each shot in each scene was carefully composed and mathematically balanced, there was a symmetry to shapes and buildings and the way in which they were captured. The lighting was incredibly clean and succinct, objects were so smooth and defined I couldn't believe my eyes. I also think the camera movements like quick zooms or when the camera moved up to a character, or shots like of the entire club were revolutionary and you can definitely see the influence of the camera work in later films. I feel like this is the film or one of the films in which our cinematic history transitions into the modern period with acting and camera-work the kind that were used to, the film strangely didn't feel old to me it looked and flowed like it could have been made yesterday. The plot itself isn't bad, it's suspenseful and exciting and interesting, Bogart and Bergman are talented actors but Bogart stood out to me the most. You can see his influence on later actors portraying dark disturbed men in historical films or action films or a combination of both.",10,4,6,19 October 2012
Citizen Kane," Classic
","I have to praise this one for its futuristic and completely innovative camera work. I was shocked when I first saw this movie, I had never expected such defined, glowing, steady and adroit camera movements and cinematography. I don't know how Orson Welles did it after hearing from a number of sources that this was his first film ever and that he had little filming experience in general. I just know that the whole thing contains a great message. The narration is insane too, the complexity of time within the film, and the plot as it's winded in so many different directions. The film in its style and speed feels fresh enough. But the story is not a new one, although it is a thought provoking and well-told one, it felt a bit too much for me in this day and age. There were elements of age within the film, certain things that didn't mean as much today for me. Orson Welles has an unforgettable charisma as well as a face which is contagious, he puts those elements to good use.",9,1,2,19 December 2012
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver
","Robert Deniro committed to history, signed his name, in this film with his acting a masterpiece and nothing less. The way his character was so dreadfully lonely and isolated, and the way his anger and loneliness grew into what it did, and the way the cinematography and jazz music captured that loneliness in the city, of a single man amongst the crowds, the desolation and hunger amongst the people in the city and the people he encounters, the destitution and darkness it's all powerful. What's even more heartbreaking to me is the fact that Travis Buckle is a smart, optimistic warmhearted caring person full of humor and how that sort of shrivels away the longer he is in his environment. I love how his taxi becomes a ghost like figure. I also thought it was interesting how almost everyone was isolated or a depressing figure in some way, how most of the men especially in the film were lonely and how that loneliness effected all the women around them",10,1,2,19 December 2012
The Graduate," The Graduate
","I liked how Dustin Hoffman portrayed the clueless and aimless college graduate. I think we've all been his character at one point or another. The humor in the awkward scenes between Misses Robinson and Benjamin were great, so was the tension and excitement. Misses Robinson was damn seductive and sultry and just a sexy lady all around and I love how that changed and how she became an evil sexy woman, she was subtle throughout the entire film. The music was wonderful, and the camera work was hip and smooth, the film felt youthful, it felt lively and sexy and naive all at the same time,amazingly seeing as it's over 40 years old.The story itself was strange and a nice change from the Hay's Code era I'm sure.",10,2,2,19 December 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Singin In the Rain
","I'm not a fan of musicals but I have to admit this one had some darn catchy tunes. The joy and sense of music was contagious, the colors and the infamous rain scene were delightfully directed and acted. One of my favorite scenes was the dreamlike one in which the woman with the very long white dress flowing danced and the man danced around her and her dress, the camera movements and the choreography not just in that scene but the entire film were awe inspiring. It made you feel like a kid, kind of brought out that sappy youthfulness which was alright. It's a positive feel good film, the technique and wonderful singing and dancing help keep your eyes glued to what's going on because it's so elegant and over the top, and so it's worth watching if you're ever feeling down.",8,0,1,19 December 2012
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction
","This was pure entertainment. Sure it had gratuitous amounts of violence, sure it was over the top, sure a watch carried in someones butt for a long time is hilarious, sure there was weird and freaky things going on but the film wasn't ever boring or badly told. Tarantino is a master of storytelling, editing and fun. There's never a lost moment, perfection abounds. Samuel Jackson is unforgettable, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, I mean I don't even know what to say, they're all just wonderful. How can you forget the scene with Christopher Walken? I can't remember any of the acting being bad ever, each character was interesting and fun to watch in his or her own way. The dialogue in the film is funny and slick. Pop culture references are tossed around, characters are found in funny situations and conversations, it's a helluva ride.",10,0,2,19 December 2012
Psycho," Psycho
","I think all that can be said about this film, like some classics has already been said. Janet Leigh screaming in the shower is the seminal horror film image of all time. The movie has some of the best plot twists toward the middle I've ever seen, the control of climax and character study, their psychology and manners is impressive. There's a pleasurable amount of photographic technique and detail, of precision throughout the film and that makes it lasting. There's very little gore or violence which is great, because it leaves that up to the imagination unlike other films. Some of the actors come across brilliantly in their creepiness and darkness, and their motives aren't always exactly known, the thrill is skillfully and cleverly composed and arranged and released throughout the film, it lives up to its name.",9,0,0,19 December 2012
