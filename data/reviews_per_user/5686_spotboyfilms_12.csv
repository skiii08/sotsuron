Ford v Ferrari," A film that would be better off as a documentary
","Ford v Ferrari is a movie with a great Christian Bale performance, and it tries to tell the interesting tale of the events leading up to Ford's incredible win at Le Man's. The way they choose to show this had a few great scenes, but ultimately was not as interesting as it could be in documentary form. The best example I can think of is the difference between Man on Wire vs. The Walk. Documentary is just the better format to tell this interesting story.",6,1,5,24 November 2019
Knives Out," We need more of these films
","I was blown away by Knives Out. The movie grasps you at the beginning, builds and stretches tension to it's breaking point, and never lets go. I wasn't in board with the quasi political debate, but overall it was not pulling down the story. Lots of laughter sprinkled throughout the film. All actors were firing on all cylinders. What a great ensemble cast and a wonderful film. Great to watch with family, friends, a date etc. One of my favorite films of 2019",10,1,5,16 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Force is weak with this one
","If you ever wondered what Star Wars would be if Michael Bay directed it, look no further than this mess of a movie. It is hard to swallow the rushed, soulless, fan-serviced, reactionary tone of this movie. TLJ might be imperfect, but it definitely had coherence, development, and memorable moments. TFA lacked originality, but was a lot of fun. ROS is none of the above. It is as if a 8 year old mashed together a story from all the new folklore. The visuals are not even that amazing on this one. The fight choreography sucks in this one. This is the worst Star Wars of the new trilogy.",4,6,12,29 December 2019
Yesterday," A fun setup with good music and a cliche ending
","Yesterday is enjoyable mostly due to the lead actors and a interesting premise. The performances for the songs are very enjoyable. Himesh Patel owns the role and delivers a fun performance. The buy into the fantasy is a little unbelievable, it just kind of happens with not real gravity to the event that sets the plot in motion. The movie has a interesting first half with a promise of a good second half that it does not deliver on. It turns into a romantic movie in the second half and it's full of cliches. So, it's worth watching once especially if you like the Beatles.",5,1,2,3 July 2019
Toy Story 4," A good setup without a payoff
","Toy Story 4 starts out well with a great premise, Woody is going to recover a Toy named Forky that Bonnie created using her own imagination. The ideas that were worth exploring with Forky were boundless-what is the meaning of being a toy? Toy Story 4 explores this idea for a little while and then fully abandons it halfway through the movie. It turns into the usual Toy Story plotlines. Forky is barely a part of the finale. Buzz is forced into the storyline when he really doesn't serve any purpose whatsoever (he is really forced in there to introduce two side characters and get a key, which is really something unnecessary for the story to happen). Pixar delivers a good film, which I consider Pixar's version of phoning it in. I wish they had fully explored Forky's storyline to make a great Pixar film.",5,1,6,6 July 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Must Watch Comedy
","This movie deserves it's cult status. It takes the world of the Teenage-slasher-horror film and tilts it 90 degrees to create a comedy film that will make you fall out of your seat with funny. The cast is amazing. Especially the two leads in Tucker and Dale. Their performances are strong, funny, and heartfelt. The direction is excellent, the writing is funny and smart. As one reviewer pointed out, it's not stupid-funny like the Scary Movie series. Tucker and Dale vs Evil is funny to it's core. It is also a unique film to the horror-comedy genre.",10,0,0,7 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great performance by DiCaprio
","I started off with 7 and added a 8th star for originality. 'Once upon a time in Hollywood' is unique like most of Tarantino's work. O-Hollywood seems to lack dramatic direction and theme. Several intertwined storylines merge with no true justification of merging historic events into the finale. However, the movie truly shines in each individual scene- you are almost watching several short films as the characters traverse the entire film. The transition to each of these scene blocks is so seamless that you are already I the middle of it before you know that it happened 5 minutes ago. Leo DiCaprio will surely be nominated for one of the best performances put to film.",8,1,4,20 October 2019
Aladdin," A magic-less tale
","Aladdin (2019) lacks the 'feels' that the original had. The strongest thing about the film is the world-building of the city. The wardrobe, makeup, and production design is pretty impressive. It's refreshing to see a ethnically-appropriate actor play the character of Aladdin. I wish they had done the same with Jasmine (even though the actress is really beautiful). For a kids movie, I haven't seen so many bored children watching this film, even when Genie comes on screen. Aladdin, Genie, the Villain, are all not very engaging.
SPOILERS AHEAD:
The movie feels like they had some original ideas that were lost along the way- for example, Aladdin's acrobatics and inventiveness never comes in to play later on the movie. Another example- the bad guy says his origins are similar to Aladdin's- as a street-rat, but they never do anything interesting with that. There's Genie's B-Love-Story that ultimately is pretty boring and contrived, seems to be placed there just to pad the run-time. When Genie gets his freedom, what should have been a strong emotional scene is just so weak. You don't feel it. Almost like it was another mark on a checklist of things to do.
When you see that kids are yawning theough the magical carpet flying in the sky segment of the film, you know the wonder is missing. I wish they had done a better job with this retelling of classic Disney. It feels so called in, and unoriginal. It feels like a Hanna Montana episode on the Big-screen. Robin William's Genie is a hard act to follow. But it seems like the filmmakers and Will Smith didn't even get anywhere emotionally with the Genie- forget the antics.",2,107,197,4 June 2019
1917," Great technically, Poor Narratively
","Films like 1917 focus so much on style that they leave behind any narrative strength. 1917 plays like a Video Game, and would probably make a great 10/10 video game like Call of Duty. Now, from a cinema point of view, the cinematography, production design, and wardrobe comes together very strongly, you should probably wait h it for the 'single shot' method employed. What doesn't come across at all is any sort of tension- any sense of true danger. Compare this with Birdman, where you actually feel emotion+tension despite the one continuous shot. The one-shot in his film is a gimmick a does not add anything. It is often distracting.",5,10,25,3 February 2020
Joker," A nice looking mediocre film
","Joker is worth watching because of beautiful Cinematography, Production Design, Costumes, Makeup etc. Joaquin Phoenix has given a great performance as a mentally ill person. If the film were simply about a mentally ill person, it would probably be a very good film. However, tying it into the Batman Universe hurts the film immensely. The Gotham and Wayne aspects of the film distract from what is otherwise a decent film about society and personal struggles.",6,2,12,18 October 2019
Parasite," A Good Satire about Social Class
","Parasite is a very enjoyable film. There are no heroes in this story, just tragic anti-heroes. The first half of the film is a convenient build-up to a spectacular second half. It is a satire that pits the have and have-nots against each other. Morality is lost somewhere in the need for survival. It's a enjoyable film with an unexpected ending. Definitely worth a watch for a Cinema-lover. The subtitles are not hard to follow for a Non-Korean audience. I dropped it from 8 stars to 7 because of some voice-over narration towards the end that was very different from the tone of the rest of the film.",7,3,8,8 November 2019
Jojo Rabbit," A tragic comedy
","JoJo Rabit is certainly to be divisive in audience response. The beginning is hard to swallow because of how lightly the film handles the evils of Naziism, but once you get used to the characters and the premise, it gets easier. Different Genres are blended together quite well and seem to be Waititi's trademark. Some scenes were very powerful, and shows the potential that Waititi has, but a lot of other great moments are undercut or bookended by Comedy, which is also Waititi's trademark. It is certainly a very different film and can be funny and serious at the same time. I would suggest checking it out, but be ready for some real gut punches.",8,2,6,8 November 2019
