Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," pure fun
","as far as summer films, i haven't seen one this sharp and entertaining since T2.  The phantom Menace is that necessary starting point for us to get to the clone wars and the fall of the galactic republic.  like a lot of films though, the eye candy is the real scene stealer.  for episode 2 i would like to see obi wan and amidala do more.  lucas is not an actors director, never was and never will be.  he does need to get lawrence kasdan back and i hope he does for the writing jobs ahead. three out of four stars.  there is something to be said for a film where even its harshest critics will see it again.  as for jar jar being racist, i have seen worse examples.  he is annoying, but lucas loves this kind of kid will buy product. this is one of the most multiculutral films i have ever seen, and it isn't boring either. look at the ewoks!!!!!!!  way to go george and lay off some of that cgi in the next one.",Null,0,0,17 June 1999
