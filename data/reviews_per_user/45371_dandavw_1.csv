First Man," More Like Frost Man
","It is a true accomplishment to suck all of the air and joy out of one of the monumental accomplishments of the 20 th century. I read somewhere that Clinton Eastwood was going to direct this movie. I wish he had. I suspect he would've had some amount of enthusiasm for the topic. Clearly this director only used this subject as a prop for him to exercise his artistic impulses, which for this film were over the top.If this were supposed to be a character study of new Armstrong the man, the astronaut, it was far off. While Armstrong was an introvert, and a classic specimen of mid 20th century midwestern values and traits, he was not cold or devoid of feeling. True, he was an engineer in the fullest sense of the character, but had a passion for flying and celebrated the accomplishment landing on the moon. None of this is communicated in this movie.",3,2,4,4 November 2018
