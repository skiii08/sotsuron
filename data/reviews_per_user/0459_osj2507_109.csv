The Avengers," Great heroes unite
","This is decent entertainment, but it is in the end just an action packed movie :) I think it is a good collaboration movie between the different super heroes, but some steal the show more then others, you almost think that this is the third installment of a rich super hero movie franchise, but that came a year later.This is action and effects for every buck, there is a story, but the plot can be hard to follow and you tend to concentrate on all the eye-candy most of the time. It has a rather dark finish to it, maybe it is the new thing after the dark knight that it has to have a bit of a gloomy and dark feel, I am not especially fond of it for this film, since they are all dressed in bright colored costumes and are a more fun loving crowd then the big black bat.This is definitely entertaining and delivers a solid action packed adventure, with plenty of effects, smart replies, blasting sound and great characters.",8,1,4,7 May 2015
The Monuments Men," Classic George Clooney
","This is a somewhat typically George Clooney film, it has a very thorough and serious background story, but the actors make it seem light, great and funny because their roles have special characteristics that fits the actor and fits into the story and work well together, this blend of serious drama, action and comedy works very well and has for several of his films.This does not have as much comedy and humor as others, but it is a very entertaining and engaging film, the cast of the main characters are very well chosen and their dynamic together is making the film work, have humor and just entertain.",7,2,3,15 March 2015
The Expendables 2," If you don't like this movie...
","...you are either a girl or you just didn't know what you went into the theater to see. If you want a lot of action 'figures' or former action actors I might say, this is the movie to see, there are only a few missing before the entire eighties action actors guilt has all joined.This is great action, wild explosions, hard hitting punches, and exaggeration all the way, just as it should be. And this time with more old actors as well as a couple of new additions on the more young side :) This film does exactly what it promises and what it is supposed to, this is a film by guys, for guys and will be loved by men in all ages :DIf you haven't seen this, take your boys to town, eat a big juicy burger, get a pitcher of beer and then just enjoy this testosterone filled masterpiece, I did!",7,0,0,8 June 2015
Skyfall," A very vivid story from Ian Fleming translated to a film by Sam Mendes
","With a very vivid story from Ian Fleming translated to a film by Sam Mendes, off- course with a lot of help from manuscript writers, production team, actors, technicians and more, this is truly a one-to-watch film.This is the latest mission of James Bond and it is truly bringing both the classic legendary agent back with a couple of props from a time long a go :) and it is also setting a new standard for high impact action films, that doesn't rely entirely on CGI and effects. This has much less focus on gadgets then earlier films, but is more concentrated on the settings, the intensity and the depth of the characters and the story that evolves.This film shows Daniel Craig as James Bond, but in kind of a new way, a better more classy and old school way. It also brings back the super villain, a villain that is tricky, a step ahead, devious and manipulative and Javier Bardem certainly plays this character to perfection.If you haven't seen this or any Bond film at all, go for it, this is truly great work, very entertaining, action packed and a very good movie.",8,2,5,19 September 2015
Iron Man 3," It is purely an action movie
","Lets just say that this is as action packed, if not more then its predecessors, it is great fun and very entertaining, it does however become a bit of a mess, a lot of things happen and the clever remarks and witty comments gets left behind, they do however make room for a hell of a fight that blows it all out at the end.I think Shane Black does a good job, but Jon Favreau had something else in his two interpretations of Iron Man. This is good directing, but becomes somewhat of a mess, maybe even a blur of a lot of things.For the action and with the boys this is okay, but for anything more it doesn't really cut it, it is purely an action movie.",6,0,4,12 September 2015
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," The title say it all and you should not expect anything more
","This is a great action movie, if you take it for more you might get disappointed. I don't know that much about the real Abraham Lincoln, I am not an American :), so for me this was purely a fictional film spin off from a real live 'hero' in some sense. It has a lot of things that seems legit and the story and narrative of Lincoln himself is very good and believable, then it has a small twist, there are vampires amongst us.The acting itself is okay, but the action and fighting scenes are very well made, this is not vampires as we know them, when these get angry they get really angry and fierce looking and it is really a blast watching these scenes.It is kind of grotesque, but the title say it all and you should not expect anything more, then you won't get disappointed, I was greatly entertained.",7,0,0,23 September 2015
Gravity," Like it more and more
","This is a beautiful film, when seeing these images from space towards earth it just looks so peaceful and beautiful, like nothing can ever go wrong or disrupt the big peaceful silence, but something can and does.After about 10 minutes you are hooked, sitting on the edge of your seat, wishing, hoping and sayings thank god that is not me out there. This is a great sci-fi thriller, it is very realistic and very powerful in this deliverance of the story and sub stories, I don't know it this is unrealistic or not, but it really was entertaining and fantastic.I think it was very hyped, but after talking about it with others who have seen it, I like it more and more, in the beginning I might have set my hopes to high, but digging into the film more gives it more meaning and the fact that this is so technically good and very well acted is amazing.",7,6,10,10 June 2015
Lone Survivor," Harsh movie from the beginning
","This is a harsh movie, but you already know that with the introduction, taken from some kind of breaking boot camp for seals.This is based on real events, that makes it personal in a way and very vivid. Three acts is what this movie holds, and director Peter Berg makes sure we know the characters and their lives before heading them into the second act, this is where hell breaks loose, lots of action, bullets, explosions etc. going on there. The third act ends it of, it does however not show every Afghan as a Taliban terrorist, very refreshing and a different ending then what you mind expect. But it also gets a bit to stars and stripes for me, maybe thats the liberal European in me talking... never mind that.The Scenes seem very real, great action, great explosions and great scenery to keep it all together. This is entertaining and you should see it if you like war scenes with all that that entails.",7,1,2,8 June 2015
Star Trek," I'm no Trekkie, loved this one
","Lets start on saying, i'm no Trekkie, I have seen my fair share of Star Trek both the series and some of the movies.In my opinion this is very true to the story and the characters, its a good reboot and will hopefully bring 'the next generation' to watch this franchise. It is kind of like seeing the old series, we get all the characters introduced, shown their worth and abilities and it is all packed in a film filled with effects, nice angles, something old, something new and just entertainment.This is a good movie, with a lot of good acting, a lot of action, a lot of effects and actually also a lot of humor.",8,1,7,12 September 2015
Inglourious Basterds," Differently performance
","Wanted to see this for a long time, finally got to see Christoph Waltz in his first Tarantino (he was great in Django) and with the rest of the cast I was not disappointed.The Basterds are a great bunch of people, ranging from eccentric to really weird :) There are many good parts in this movie and it has that special Tarantino vibe, it all plays together very well.If you like any of the actors/actresses in this movie, you will love their performance here, they all play very differently then earlier work in my opinion. But also if you like Tarantino this is also for you, it is not as gory as I thought it would be, but it has its portion of blood and 'special' scenes.",8,0,0,18 February 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," This is a great prequel
","This is the greatest Star Wars film to date, yes it wouldn't have been the same without the originals, but the fact that it takes so much from them and makes it all stick is just great to see.My son and I went to see this film and we were very thrilled, before, during and after, it was just a good experience and what we had hoped for.Location, seating & time: Falkonér, Frederiksberg, Denmark - Bio 5, row 7 seat 1 & 2 - 04.01.2017 at 18.30",8,3,7,12 March 2017
This Is the End," They do entertain
","They sure have a crowd that can and should entertain, and they do, but this comedy was not how I pictured it, it was however very good in the form it was. This is very enjoyable and the fact that all the characters play them self is just a great thing, they are strange, funny, corny, cruel and much more, but it makes it all hilarious and very down to earth.There are a lot of smaller stories going on and the characters really take a toll on each other with their different behaviors and strange attitudes and the Bromance is really hitting a high through out all of the movie.",7,0,3,9 June 2015
World War Z," My first reaction was... Zombies and Brad Pitt...
","...hmm I wonder if that will work ...but I actually think it did and it did good, there are some parts of the movie that I didn't like (see below, spoiler alert), but there are many really good things and they kept me interested and entertained.Likes, the chaos and selfishness in the beginning, the doubt and despair through out it all, the fights and survival tactics, the explosions, the viciousness of the zombies, the fast moving scenery and the locations (especially Istanbul).Dislikes (one big spoiler), Istanbul was the greatest disappointment or the 'only' weakness in the film, why do you build a giant ass wall and doesn't post any guards on top, the zombies would still have gotten in with their tactic, but it would have made it much more realistic.",8,1,1,12 September 2015
The Hunger Games," This is definitely a better love story then Twillight :)
","There are many cool things about this futuristic flick, the universe in where it takes place bears much resemblance to our modern society, but it do hold some new tricks and possibilities so to say.Katniss is not like the other combatants in this game, but she is definitely skilled in many ways, she is skilled with a bow, she is graceful, helpful and compassionate, but can be fierce and fiery.This is different in the good way, entertaining in many ways, with action, effects and theatricals, it also has a good story, I hope the following will be as good as the first one and keep up the steam and intensity.",8,0,4,9 June 2015
Zootopia," Just watch it and be entertained on several levels
","Disney really knows there way around a good story, one that have meaning and takes up a 'difficult' subject so that both kids and adults get something out of it. We were all entertained, the entire family had been looking forward to this and we wasn't disappointed at all.You can see this just for the animation, that is really awesome and beautiful, it is also very rich both in color, but also in realism and diversity, the world of Zootropolis and it's different areas are really one great spectacle to watch.You can also see it for the characters, really just a lot of different representatives from vast areas of the animal kingdom, the main ones would maybe not be the obvious choice (a rabbit and a fox), but they meet so many others and it is a great experience to watch the diversity. There are so many characters to love in this, from our main characters Judy Hops and Nick Wilde, to Flash the funniest sloth I have ever seen, but there are so many other lovable characters.You could also see it for the story and the subject, it really is a great one, it has it all and my kids got as much out of it as I did, it really speaks to your senses and emotions, maybe a bit subliminal, but if you think about it again and again something got to give.Maybe see it for all of the above, it is an enjoyable animation all the way and with all it entails, just watch it and be entertained, you should be on several levels.Location, seating & time: Bio City, Nordisk Film, Taastrup, Denmark - Bio 1, row 9 seat 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5 - 17.02.2016 at 10.00",9,10,18,28 March 2016
The Impossible," Strong, overwhelming and emotional film
","This is a very strong, overwhelming and emotional film, I guess that the real family suffered more then they show on this film, based on real events, must have been a very difficult film to make in this case.Naomi Watts is very great at her part, a though one with physically demanding parts and a very hard role to make believable, but she definitely makes it work and gives a very fine presentation. Also the rest of the cast have strong roles and make the film both entertaining, dramatic, heart-warming and charismatic.There are some very fascinating scenes, the Tsunami itself, the wasteland they walk through and the endless masses of people in need of attention at the hospitals.Strong film, strong cast that tells the story of this strong family that unlike many others makes it through and survives the perils.",8,6,7,12 September 2015
Argo," Ben Affleck is very good at making these kinds of films
","I am not that much of an historian, meaning I know a little about a lot of history, but no specifics more or less :) This was a story I did not know about, this is based on actual events, but for me this is what happened at that time, since I don't know the real story. This is in other words a Hollywood interpretation, of what happened in 1979, when a Hollywood film production (or almost) helped Americans to escape.I think Ben Affleck is very good at making these films that either have a political agenda as this one, or shows a story about ordinary people that endures specific events, witch the people in this film also does.I like the characters and the scenery, it is all very late seventies to me and works very well. This is certainly a film where you have to follow closely what is happening, but it also have time for clever remarks, small funny things and great acting.",8,0,2,15 September 2015
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Way to go...
","This is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a long time, it has the story, the characters, the jokes and a lot more.It is not just funny, it actually deals with a serious subject and deals with it in a very good and mature way, and it delivers very well, I was very entertained all the way.The two main characters are acted out by Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling and they can really act, they both seem very into their character and are very convincing. They are really good together and there is a good vibe in their acting, but also between the two characters.You should watch this, it should be on the 100 comedies to watch before you die list :)",8,0,1,16 April 2015
Madagascar," Animals out of their 'natural' habitats
","This is a very good animation film, the characters, the voices and actors behind them do a great job, they feel very real and alive.This is really all about the characters, where they go and what they do doesn't mean as much as them and their interactions. David Schwimmer does a great job as this overprotective Giraf, he is the hypochondriac in the crowd and he really has some great outburst. Actually all the characters have their own special blend, I will let you experience it on your own, but I will say that it is all the side characters that is really the most fun. And who could see Chris Rock as this very loud mouth Zebra, the voices just really works for this character.",9,0,0,10 June 2015
Ted," Some will still find it over the top
","It started watching this with the notion that it might be a bit too much, a bit strange and a bit childish and yes it is these things but in a good way, slightly overdoing it at points, maybe a bit to long or stretched, but all-in-all very funny, entertaining and actually just a great movie.There is a lot a 'cute' bear can say and do, that doesn't seem that harsh or offending coming from a teddy bear, but would be a bit too much coming from a real live character, but when this live characters talks to the bear it is also alright :) Lets just say that they exploit that fact many times in this movie, they do it well and they do it hard, it is hilarious at times.Very nice entertaining, some will still find it over the top, but I just liked it and enjoyed it very much.",7,0,1,19 September 2015
Spotlight," Interesting, disturbing, doing-the-right-thing drama
","I had deliberately not seen much about this film, I knew the subject, I knew the cast, but I didn't go into the nominations, the reviews or anything before watching it, I wanted to be surprised and entertained without setting too much expectations in the way. It was difficult not getting any info on this, It hasn't premiered here in Denmark yet, but is already collecting a ton of reviews from the US, but I managed to see it at a special sneak peek before release, arranged by kino.dk and it was very good.It is a very interesting way of showing these events or the notion and exploration of them, seeing it all from the journalists, how the start digging at something that seems small and then it just escalates, in Denmark there wasn't that big a fuzz about this, we are not that many catholics, so seeing the attention and wide range it had for the city of Boston and how it spread after the story broke is quite overwhelming. That this could even happen and be covered up again and again is appalling, but the film shows the story from a very good side, I expect that had it been some years ago, it would have focused more on the 'bad' priests, what they did and why they did and how they covered it up, but seeing it all from the investigative side, from the journalists at The Boston Globe Spotlight division is really interesting. How they keep digging and digging, uncovering more cases, finding more survivors, talking to people and lawyers and trying to make it all make sense.The acting is really good, they are all experienced at their jobs, some a bit out off their usual element, but they do a very fine job. Especially Mark Ruffalo as the workaholic, very persistence reporter, but also Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams & Liev Schreiber have some great roles as the Spotlight reporters, I could extend the list to all the other cast members, they all do a fantastic job. You can see the tenacity, persistence, frustrations and excitement on all of them, they don't know how deep the rabbit hole will be, they don't know who they will drag into this, they just know they are on to something and they have to be meticulous, secretive, stubborn and just keep at it.It was a treat seeing this at a special screening before the release here in Denmark, in has been out in the states for some time, but will not have theatrical release here before end February.Location, seating & time: Dagmar, Nordisk Film, Vesterbro, Denmark - Bio 4, row 4 seat 1, 2, 4 & 6 - 26.01.2016 at 16.30",8,2,3,26 January 2016
Juno," Great, fun, shy, teenage comedy
","Finally got around to watch this, this is a great, fun, shy, teenage comedy. I think there are a lot of funny moments, some drama and a great deal of awkward/quirky ones that fits the characters and the story/plot very well. I might have given it higher had I seen it some years ago, I think it was very fitting its time and captured the way life would/could be at that time, if you where a pregnant teenager with a strange boyfriend as the father that is :)It was greatly entertaining and funny, both Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody made this something special, and the characters and the actors playing them had something special and fitted their roles perfectly. This is a teenage comedy that should be watched and gives interesting moments and intelligent feedback to the characters in it and the watchers seeing it.",7,0,2,12 September 2015
Don Jon," Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a Don in this one
","Very nice film from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, not only does he do acting, he also does some pretty good writing and directing with this film, it is a very good debut as a director I must say.Our main character holds eight things very dear, those are his body, pad, ride, family, church, boys, girls, and porn, especially the two last have some conflicts and that is what this story is centered around.It is very explicit and graphical, that works to its advantage and reveals a lot of our character Don Jon, but it also lacks a few pointers here and there, it is all moving fast and you don't really get every aspect of either Jon 'Don Jon' Martello Jr. or the people he surrounds himself with.",7,1,2,9 June 2015
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The pace is very smooth and calm
","At first this movie seem very long, I was a bit tired and that is not the time to see a film like this, you have to pay attention at all times and find out what is going on and how this story unfolds and is an entangled mess of small stories and chaotic happenings melting together. I guess this is what it has been like in MI-6 or other agencies at troubled times, who is covering for whom, who is to be trusted or maybe is not and how can the web be untangled.There are many great actors in this film and they all play their roles to perfection, their characters are very different, but all have good, sad or character defining or changing moments and these are great to watch.The film is long and not action packed, not even in the action scenes, the pace is very smooth and calm, just like the main character played by Gary Oldman. It seems very live like and very historically correct and that makes it interesting and entertaining.",8,1,1,16 September 2015
The Hateful Eight," I came, I saw, I don't know how exactly to feel about it all
","This is a grand film in many ways, it is shown in a special version from the theaters that are able to do so, 70mm version was last used in 1966 so they have been dusting off some old equipment and are doing something special once again. The version I saw was the roadshow with 7 minutes intro, and 12 minutes intermission, it was a fun concept to introduce the old way of making a spectacle about the film and showing it in a 'live' way for the audience.I have never been a true fan of Tarantinos dialog based films, well that is not exactly true, I think he does a lot with characters and dialogs, but sometimes it gets to be too much for me, I like to be entertained, sometimes shut off the brain and just relax and watch a good movie. You can't do that with Tarantino, you have to pay attention and follow what happens, stay vigilant and so on :)This is a crazy homage from Tarantino to the craft, technique and film in general that he loves, not sure what to say about it other then it is stunning in it's pictures, special by the 70mm version, something different by the roadshow thing - so showing a long intro with the music playing, having an intermission and a film that is summarized after the first two hours, just to keep everybody on track of what we as audience missed and in the end having seen almost three hours of film, that is strangely mind blowing.Location, seating & time: Imperial, Nordisk Film, Vesterbro, Denmark - Bio 1, row 17 seat 36 & 38 - 06.01.2016 at 20.00",8,0,8,12 January 2016
Fast & Furious 6," Physics defying and entertaining
","This is a really good, action packed, physics defying and entertaining film. After Vin Diesels return to the series it has been better and better, yes they still drive cars, yes they still do heists, yes they make it look really easy and cool to race a car and drive recklessly, but it all works, it is very entertaining and fun.I also think the new not just racing cars work for this series of films, there has to be more to it then racing, the family aspect and action aspects really gives it something new and exciting.I don't know what is going to happen with the seventh installment of this, now that Paul Walker can't be part of the crew, he did a great job and will be missed, but I hope they continue in the same spirit and if nothing else finish it off in a nice way.",8,4,6,10 June 2015
The Expendables," Yes, Yes, Yes
","You won't get better action then this... this is as old school as can be, and its really good.Today everything has to be perfect in any way, good story, good cast, good acting, good effects, good CGI etc. This brings us back to the good old principles of movie making, an action movie doesn't have to have the best story, it doesn't have to have overwhelming CGI, it just have to entertain the viewer, have a good hard-hitting cast and a few corny moments and one-liners.This film takes me back to the good old days, where we all loved the 'real' explosions, over buffed cast and characters that could kill hundreds of men without getting much more then a scratch. This is 100% pure action, with all the old dogs and I loved watching it.",8,1,1,8 June 2015
Pan's Labyrinth," I should have seen this many years ago
","I should have seen this many years ago, it is a great movie.This is a sad and maybe a bit disturbing story, in the real life anyway, but in this film all the bad things disappear and transforms into a fairytale, maybe not a all sweet and happy fairytale. This is more a very real, strong and vivid one, that also have tests, pain and suffering and something special at the end.It is a dark movie, both in it's scenery and in the story, set during the Spanish civil war and in a fight between a captain, his army and the rebels, this can only bring dark tidings. Especially in the hands of Guillermo del Toro this becomes an experience, a fairytale and very entertaining from the beginning to end.",9,2,5,19 September 2015
Megamind," Quite different from other superhero animations
","I saw this the other day, with my two kids and wife at the cinema, this is a great movie, even though it's quite different from other superhero animations, you can't help compare it to them. As such a comparison goes, this has some great new stuff, but it is lacking some of the heroism that is often seen in these kind of movies.It's a really fun movie for the kids, but animation today tend to have something for the grownups as well, this does have a few things, but it is mostly for the kids. I don't mean this in a bad sense, that's good that it's main focus is on the kids and can really entertain them.It is entertaining all the way through, a bit chaotic at times and seems to jump or leave out some scenes, but all-in-all it works very well.",7,0,1,5 January 2016
Capote," Ever since this won an Oscar I wanted to see it
","I still had the notion that it wasn't just a film you saw, you had to have time to reflect and understand it, and maybe that was what didn't fit in for me when I saw it.The movie is good, and the acting very real and surreal at times, I didn't know much about this Truman Capote and that was a mistake, you have to have some knowledge about this character, his life, his journalism and books, otherwise the movie doesn't give you all that you properly would like to know about both the incident, but also about Mr. Capote.The Plot of this film, as real as it may bee, is a long one, I knew it was a drama and Biography but mostly they are spiced up a bit for the movie viewers sake, I don't believe this was, this is the actual events (more or less), and that makes it an interesting movie, but also a long and very describing movie. It is however definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it, but you have to like these kind of Biographies.",7,0,0,25 December 2015
Doctor Strange," He is strange, Doctor strange :)
","There is a lot of humor in this film, a lot of effects, a lot of beautiful scenery, well there is a lot of many things and it all works very well together.I didn't know much about the comic or the background story, but it is all explained and gives the viewers a detailed look into the strange characters in this universe.Location, seating & time: Cinemaxx, København, Denmark - Bio 4, row D seat 1 & 2 - 05.11.2016 at 19.00",8,1,2,12 March 2017
Pacific Rim," You have to think, why is it I am going to see this film
","Lets just say if it is for high impact action, grant and vivid effects, visuals and scenery not seen before and off-course giant robots fighting 'aliens', well this film will definitely hit the spot :)This will take the trophy for most boyish film of the year, I don't think many girls will actually like this :) This is a very nice homage to the classic monster movies, I have watched quit a few lets call them b-movies with big monsters that attacked humans, and this has many references to the old classics. I was feeling a bit like a child just sitting and watching these giant creatures and robots and just loving it. This is making transformers look outdated, the Transformers themselves is like toy cars in comparison, the scenery is futurist, beautiful and mind blowing at times. The action is head on from the beginning, and the battles are just awesome.If you set yourself up to action, effects, explosions, fighting etc. this film will have you entertained most times, there is a bit time for the story, cause and effect, but mainly it focuses on the giant monsters and the big ass robots.",7,0,1,12 September 2015
American Sniper," America to America
","Some believe, or at least write, that this is propaganda, I do not agree entirely. I believe this is glorification, or a celebration of what was a troubled American war veteran, those stories are needed, especially if you see it in the light of Client Eastwood. I think he has made a very well crafted movie (so what you can see a baby doll), this is really a good story, well acted by all involved, very indulging and exciting for the viewer.Maybe it is mostly by America to Americans, it is a very patriotic movie, but also a proud movie about fighting for your country, not giving up on each other, believing and hoping for the best, overcoming fears and having seen and experienced terrible things you can't even begin to imagine or express.Bradley Cooper does a fantastic job in the role of Chris Kyle, he makes it all seem very real, his tours to war and all the things he has to do there, all the things that he experience and just can't leave behind, the things that troubles him and those he keeps bottled up or can't shake and explain. I really felt his dedication to helping others, not leaving anybody behind and being there for your mates and country, and you can really feel how it starts to crumble and become too much, the frustration and the feelings and anger his body can't handle.A though movie, but more in a psychologically sense then in watching what is actually being shown, it is not very bloody, there is a war, but most of the struggles are in his and your mind.",7,5,18,2 February 2015
"Monsters, Inc."," Collection of details
","A really nice animation film, visually it is very alive and the ode to the old way with the drawn intro is very cool. It is a film for the kids and I think they can relate to some of the scary monsters, if it will help them not to believe in monster in the closet I don't know... It is also a film for the adults, there are a lot of funny sentences and references that are aimed at the adult and that is good.This is a very nice collection of details, crazy characters, a world seen from another side and a great story to back it up all the way. It is fun for both kids and grownups, and has many aspects of story and entertainment for both as well, some are in unison other separate.",9,0,1,10 June 2015
Ant-Man," My son and I loved the humor and comic spirit
","I wanted to see this with my son for a long time, but we didn't got around to it when it was in the movie theaters, we streamed it on ViaPlay the other day and it was all we had hoped for.This is really funny, some of the Marvel adoptions are really serious, there is nothing wrong with that, but the ones that we love the most are the ones where they are not all to serious, but can joke about them self and others. There is a lot of humor in this film and it fits very well for Paul Rudd to play this 'strange' character.It doesn't close any doors, so we can expect much more from this side and why not, they really had a lot of things going for them in this film, the acting and the roles, they all fit well together, mixed in with a 'crazy' older scientist and his weird invention that can turn a man into a tiny insect.Ant-man is really something for adults and kids alike, it has a lot of humor and really keeps the comic spirit, my son and I loved it.",8,1,4,28 March 2016

","This holds some very nice performances from the cast, they are all doing a great job, both setting the mood, the attitude and the scenes.The crew behind it all have also been busy, this is great casting of the actors, they really makes the characters come alive and live their lives, the styling just fits the time and place and the scenes, even though small at times, really fits well with the characters and their places to be.It is not fast moving, but have some great energetic scenes, you can really feel the energy from especially Bradley Cooper as he sees the potential and want to catch bigger fish.It is entertaining, fun, dramatic, exciting and you actually don't get the entire setup before the narration at the end, it plays out and somebody is conning somebody back and forth all the time.",7,0,2,14 March 2015
Rush," Never been much into sports movies
","This one really is a great movie, Ron Howard and his crew have really made a gripping Drama about Rivalry, competition, pressure, determination and love for the sport. This is not just about driving fast and beating the competition, it is about friendship and feuds on and outside the racing field.It has brilliant performances by both Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl, but also the side characters play a big role in each of these racers cause of action. I have been looking to Chris as a good actor, but not in this genre, this really proves his great acting abilities and that he can do much more then look pretty :) Daniel Brühl has a very strong performances, you can really feel the strict rules and the determination from his character, and even in his strange way of showing the love for the sport and his fellow racers and the pain, but that you have to watch.Great entertaining, sublime acting and a really good composition of sounds, images, storytelling and plot. This is one to watch.",8,0,0,8 June 2015
Oblivion," Not one of the most memorable
","A lot of Sci-fi films have and are coming out at the moment, the one thing about Sci-fi is that they have to be big, bold and filled with CGI, Action and adventure :)I do think this film has a lot of qualities, I do also think that it will not be one of the most memorable films in this genre this year, but it has a lot of good effects, small pearls that keeps the story interesting, surprising and watchable. But there are also things that are not working in this, things that seems too much, changeable during the film and maybe a bit strange.Beech played by Morgan Freeman is one of the more enjoyable characters and even though he is not as mysteries as he appear, he does a great job. Jack Harper played by Tom Cruise is a very typical calm on the surface a bit of a hot head on the inside, action Tom Cruise character, he does all right, but we are missing some humor for this character (way to serious).It is an entertaining, very scenic movie, a lot of action and good elements of sci-fi, but it still feels like something is missing, and the story is a bit too strange at times or too unbelievable.",6,0,1,12 September 2015
Apocalypse Now," I can only image how the Vietnam war must have been
","I like war flicks, and this is definitely a classic, I never saw it till now (I have seen other classics like Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, The Deer Hunter, Born on the 4th of July etc.), but this is definitely one of the 'bigger' ones.Well first of the good old days and the good old ways of making film has something about it, real people in 'real' surroundings that are sweating and dirty, real explosions instead of computer effects and very good acting parts that make you believe the story and the conditions.The way this film is filmed and the narration from the main character on the way works very well, off course this film is made in the good old days and by Francis Ford Coppola that immediately gives it a status as a must see flick. I wasn't disappointed at all, even though it is a long film at times, it is very well instructed and acted and makes it all fit together.I can only image how the Vietnam war must have been, and by the looks in this film and others, it couldn't have been a pleasant experience. Looking at this, I hope that there wasn't that many crazies in the jungle and in commanding post, but this maybe gives an bit over the top, but in some ways a realistic picture of the conditions.",8,0,1,21 December 2015
Ender's Game," I want to play those games
","Great Sci-fi action film, it almost gets to serious at times, even though there is some funny moments it gets more and more intense and you can really feel the pressure and anxiety of the trainees. It is great to follow all the different characters and see them evolve, especially Ender Wiggin played by Asa Butterfield has a very hard personality, but it is captured very well and nicely supported by the other characters as they see Ender evolve, so do they.This is sci-fi all the way, there have been many films in this genre the past year, but this is definitely of the better, it has a good story, great characters, ups and downs and it just all works very well together. It is like a big video game, you would really like to play along some times in the movie, instead of just watching from the sideline :)",7,0,1,9 June 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Hard hitting action as always
","This is entertaining, fast moving, hard hitting, mind boggling stunts, everything all at once and it is very very entertaining, there is so much doing on at all times that it is almost too much :)This is one of the best series of action/spy movies, Bourne is also a valid one to mention, but these even though seeming impossible (kind of the punch line) they are just cleverly carried out infiltrations and heists and it is fun to see every time.The action in this and especially the chasing scenes, if you have seen the trailer, the motorbikes are just insanely fast and it is just like being in the seat yourself at times, almost crashing into cars and mountainsides, it is a crazy ride.It is hard to explain what is so good about it, but this is all the way action and acceleration for the viewer and it just works out.",7,0,3,30 September 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man," Great reboot, but maybe a bit too soon
","This is a very nice reboot of the series and I will be seeing the next one (in 2014 I think), I like the change of scenery, enemies and the story in general, but I am not sure if I like this or the 'old' Spiderman the best, they each have very nice qualities.This is certainly entertaining and action packed just as much as the series before, and yes they maybe skip ahead a bit because we all ready know how Spidey came to be, but the Connor side is very good and actually better then the first movie of the series before.I think a reboot is too soon, but never the less this is a good one and you should see, enjoy and be amazed :)",7,0,4,23 September 2015
The Lego Movie," Great great great
","This is very funny for both old and young, especially the younger crowd will see all the wonders that you can create with Lego :) and the grown ups just get the childhood back and it is riveting.I grew up with LEGO, being from Denmark it was a big part of what was the thing to play with, we even visited Lego Land in Jutland several times when I was a kid. This film really brings back happy times.But the film itself is also very well made and really has humor, great timing, a good story and much much more. There are small things everywhere, in the big scenes and in the dialogs and the characters not all is for the younger crowd, but it is enjoyable for all ages and there is never a dull moment.",9,0,1,8 June 2015
Inside Out," Everybody have voices and feelings in their heads...
","...it's just a matter of who is at the controls and who is 'playing' with each other, thinking of the matter it is interesting to notice that if you think back to your younger times are most of the feelings one-sided or when did it shift to be the good with the bad, the happy and sad, the playful and scary.This is a really good story, there are some great observations about mood and feelings and thought and genders and much much more. We all have different feelings in us and we all know that sometimes we can't control them, sometimes we are sad for no apparent reason, sometimes e just think of something nice. This film makes sense of a lot of things and put things in perspective, gives both children and adults something to think about and ponder if that is how it is, how we remember things, it did for me anyway.This film has something new, not that Pixars stories haven't had feelings before, they all have, but this is a very 'real' animation, a story that could have been made as an ordinary film, but that in this universe can say a lot of things you wouldn't be able to in a film with real actors. This film gave me much more then the usual funny moments meant for the adults, this was mind boggling, funny, adventures, strange and emotional, my kids saw a whole different movie in many aspects, but they also felt the feelings involved and even my six year old (almost seven) said stuff about the movie that I didn't think she would understand, we all had a great time with this animation.Some memories fade away and some linger with us for a long long time, are they all there or do we have to push things aside for the 'important' memories, do we have to expand some areas of the mind, destroy some to make room for others, all great things that we can think about and have in perspective after watching this film.They do open up for a whole new story, I guess when Puberty arrive, we will see a lot more of anger and we will see happy have to deal with a lot of new scenarios :)",9,6,30,6 September 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Watch them all
","In short, watch this film, see them one after another, I saw it when I had to wait for the finale for a year. I think watching them one after another will be a great experience, just like we all did with the Lords of the rings.This was a really entertaining movie, what really makes this great is the Dragon, he is in both visual and voice truly magnificent.The only bad thing about this film is that it is kind of the long stretch in the middle of a film, where they explain a lot, but you are still missing the exciting ending, so this is what I am waiting for now then :)",8,0,4,8 June 2015
Bridesmaids," I wouldn't say I'm proud to have seen this movie :)
","I am not embarrassed about it either, well I had heard that this was fun and it might add up to being the female version of The Hangover.To some extend this is the female version, but it is also a British version, meaning that many of the jokes and the humor in general are more British, this isn't a bad thing at all, I love British humor but sometimes it gets a little to far out.This is a good and funny movie, but at times it tries to hard to make it funny and that ends up in scenes that are too much or over the top. It works in the small comedy shows, but on the big screen we don't need these brother and sister landlord parts or the one where they all occupy the restroom in different ways after food poisoning, well enough about that.All-in-all it is fun and entertaining, has great characters, funny sketches and great acting.",7,0,0,21 December 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Very vivid tale
","The book was as I remember it (read it many years ago), truly fantastic, vivid and something very different from what I had read at that time. The language and finesse, the scenery and places it describes, the characters and creature (good or bad), it was all one big adventure.Well lets take the film then, is it too much to divide it into three films, yes I guess at the moment I think so, but are the two next films going to be as good, well I certainly hope so. there is no way you can't find this film beautiful, extraordinary and something truly adventures and magic. I was very entertained and loved it all the way, this is just a film you have to see, something that will awaken your inner child and keep you wishing it wasn't over so soon (or you had to wait a year for the next). It is very rich in detail and story telling and this is why it spans three movies I guess, but when these are over we might want to have The Lord of the Rings Trilogy in a new and longer version :) I don't know... but the Universe of Middle Earth is a very interesting place and spending time there in this movie is a bliss.I don't know why some people and critics are not loving this film, yes you have to compare it to the earlier films (Lord of the rings trilogy), but is all depending on those, if we have not had the earlier film would they think differently about this one, I think so...",9,1,6,8 June 2015
Non-Stop," Love this Irish bloke
","I love this Irish bloke and his career into action films, this is just like all the rest, but that is what is cool about it, he is an 'old' bad-ass and he really delivers confidence, action, fighting and awesomeness :)This film is kind of a thriller, but more action packed, it did have me guessing all the way to the end and even after the reveal you still had a lot of things going on.It is actually a good plot, there are some twist to the story most of the way and it really has you guessing back and forth, the setup is good and everything happens inside an airplane, the only contact is one the phone. Good and bad characters, but all well played and fitting in to the story and off course a lot of action packed high speed scenes that works.",6,0,0,14 March 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Delightful, playful and interesting
","I really need to catch up on Wes Andersons repertoire, his film (the ones I have seen) are really delightful, playful and interesting and this is precisely that.I think it is one big artistic sum that makes this different and great. The way he plays with colours, they are strange pastels almost like something is missing in the colouring process like when your toner is almost out. The way the music and sounds peak the senses and indulge you in the scenery and the small weird parts of the scenes. The characters are strange but meaningful to the story, the are very explicit and each has their own charismatic way of just being and belonging. And off course the big picture of the whole story that fits very well together and ties all the visuals, sounds well actually most of your senses in, I would like at times to have smell be art of it, fresh baked bread, the mountain air etc.It is just a very complete film and even though it doesn't take that long to tell the story, it works out very well and is just intriguing.",9,2,4,18 February 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," All-in-all a very good and entertaining movie
","Rupert Wyatt makes this film very interesting and enjoyable, we get a good introduction to both the human side, tests, compassion and treatment, but also the apes side and the changes and neglect that leads up to the events.This is a very entertaining prequel to the franchise, I also liked the one from 2001, but this is a better introduction/beginning to the adventure and a very realistic one also. This has some great CGI and it all seem very real and very emotional, you can easily follow both sides as they try to amend or fight for their believes.The acting is great, the CGI very convincing, the scenery very nice and the story works very well, this is all-in-all a very good and entertaining movie, can be watched for the story, the action, the cgi and much more.",8,1,2,15 September 2015
Drive," It all works very well together
","The sounds, the photography, the colors, the atmosphere, it all works very well together and has this different vibe and style. I had expected more speed, more adrenaline and more action, but the tempo and the wavy high impacted ups and the very mellow downs are working well, but it wasn't what I expected.All the actors do a very fine job, but especially Driver played by Ryan Gosling is great, Carey Mulligan and Bryan Cranston have some good supporting roles and the bad guys by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman are great.This is not a film for everyone, it's very violent a long the way, the mood, the lighting and the atmosphere is helping a lot to bring a kind of unpleasant scenery in, But it's a well directed and instructed movie, with a great cast and crew and a good story, I liked it a lot.",8,0,0,21 December 2015
Frozen," Disney fairytale when it is really good
","Disney really has returned to former glory with its latest animation films, this is a true fairytale, very beautiful, very classic and very likable.Visually this film rocks, it is truly beautiful and very remarkable what you can do with animated snow and ice :)The story is great, a very good Disney transformation, my kids loved it and especially my 5 year old daughter was really captures by the story and the characters, she sat on the edge of her seat most of the 85 minutes it lasted.This is entertaining, visually beautiful, lovable music and just a true fairytale coming to life.",9,8,15,8 June 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Walter Mitty is really a dreamer
","I guess we all know what it is to day dream, get away if it is just for a couple of minutes and pretend we are some place else or someone else. Walter Mitty is really a dreamer, he leads a secret life in his dreams, but one day he has to take action and embark on a crazy journey.This is a wonderful film, the critics was very divided and I can understand some parts of it, if you expect to see Ben Stiller in his usual way (funny and crazy), well you will get some of that but in another way then you might had expected. This film is very down to earth, small everyday things turned upside down and strange encounters is really making this film fun, not in a laugh out loud kind of a way, most of the time it is subtle, small fun things and scenes that could happen to everyone of us, but in this whole plot seem very strange, and unbelievable to happen all at once for this one guy.",8,0,0,8 June 2015
The Bourne Legacy," Kind strange having a film with the title but without the main person himself
","I like the Bourne series, but it has been some time since I've seen the earlier ones and this kind of needs that to get the whole plot and storyline straight I think.This is a good story, nicely packed with action, fights and surprises. It fits into the others in the time line and some of it does beside the third Bourne film as far as I can think. We do get introductions to some more operatives, but also some new experiments and I do not know if I like that idea. It depends on why we are first hearing about them now and if it will work with the whole story and franchise.It will be interesting to see what happens next in these film and if we get to see Bourne in the next film, it's kind strange having a film with the title but without the main person himself.",7,0,0,17 September 2015
Kick-Ass," Very violent, but you can't stop looking
","This as the name entails is a kick-ass movie, well a lot of kicking, screaming, shooting, fighting and even biting is in the movie. If you like films like shoot em up, gangster, wild west shootouts, corruption, fun comedy and much much more, then this is definitely for you.When the movie really gets going you will be a bit surprised, and maybe think this is surreal, they can't do that, but then it's just what the movie is about and its all right. It is weirdly violent, but it works out without becoming too much or too strange that they just beat each other up in various ways.Its definitely entertaining, in a kind of bizarre and strange way, but I liked it.",8,0,1,10 June 2015
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Good action packed movie
","I really like spiderman as a series, and I think Andrew Garfield does take on this more gloomy and dark version of spidey/peter parker, it works quite well and I hope that they make many more in the series.Very nice action packed movie, if you haven't seen it or know what is coming in it, maybe you should not read on **spoiler alert**.I am not a big fan of these villains or heroes for that matter that gets weird powers that is not at all plausible, spiderman well yes maybe a mutated spider could bit and transfer powers, that is okay for me, but Electro come on, he should have died in that fish tank and not become this electrical super freak evil bad guy. Give me the two other evil enemies at the end, Dane DeHaan really fits his part both as Harry Osborne, but also as the Goblin it is really good. The Rhino that we briefly see in the end is really fitting in my universe of spiderman and the evil fiends he has to battle, so for my sake those are the one they should go for.Really good and action packed, maybe a bit to long, but it keeps you entertained all the way.",7,26,44,15 March 2015
Ex Machina," One that draws you slowly into the whole matter
","I was a bit skeptical about another sci-fi about artificial intelligence, there has been some the past years that just didn't work, but this one actually does, it has a very interesting story, one that draws you slowly into the whole matter, the story and the strange world of humans, androids and artificial intelligence.In the beginning you have no clue to what is going on, you get to know the story as it unfolds for the main character, so as he experience things so do you, nothing is revealed before it actually happens and that works out quite well for this story.You begin to feel a bit paranoid and manipulated at a time, it doesn't really add up until the end, it is a strange setup in a good way, it is unpredictable and somewhat of a mind game.It is entertaining and interesting, strange and different, just a good movie to watch.",8,2,4,14 August 2015
Magic Mike XXL," Road movie fusions with a dance contest movie
","If you have seen the first, you have to see what they do in the sequel, it is not the same thing, we are not in a strip club, this is kind of a road movie fusions with a dance contest movie, in this case a stripper convention of sorts :)The first film was better, this is missing some of the people from the first film, kind of like we couldn't get people on board so we make another kind of movie. This still have it's moments, but we are missing something, it has the strippers, it has a lot of funny scenes, most of the strange characters are back and new ones are added, but it doesn't quite get up there with the first one (even though that didn't get a high score either).Again as with the first one, see it for the dancing parts, see it for the romantic comedy it is, have fun and don't expect too much other then being entertained.",5,1,1,12 January 2016
Big Hero 6," The fusion universe is quite good
","It is hard to say why I am not giving this film more stars, but there is something unexplainable that does that I can't give it any more. It is a good and entertaining film, with great new characters, but maybe it is something about the fusion universe that just doesn't add up for me.There are some fusion going on, actually two ones and they are interesting, the big thing is the city where all of this takes place, it is a mix between San Fransisco & Tokyo (San Fransokyo) and there are many great relations between them but it is a strange combination in many ways. The second fusion is between the hero universe (Marvel) and the more kids universe (Disney), it is also a bit special, but very colorful with great and sweet characters. It also have a lot of the technical and nerdy parts as we find in Iron Man and this combination of Marvel and Disney is actually also working out well.Baymax is a great character, he is sweet, big, bouncy and clumsy for a hero anyway, but he gets 'whipped' into shape and have some of the funniest moments of the film. This is a very entertaining film and can be enjoyed by both kids and adults in many ways, but I think it has most for the kids and the more nerdy comic book reading adults :)",8,0,4,1 March 2015
Evil Dead," Groovy :D
","I have a knack about horror flicks, have been a bit uncertain of this one, I loved the previous versions and think Bruce Campbell did a great job (was expecting him for a cameo), but after reading a bit and finding that this was intended as a reboot and both Raimi and Campbell was thrilled about this new version, well I thought what the hell :)This is gory, this is bloody, this is violent, this is all that the good old horror flicks was, but with new deafening sounds, great visuals, more power and just what was needed for a great horror splatter flick of the modern age.It was entertaining and had me jumping a few times, it is a good homage to the classics, mixed with some new effects and CGI it all works out very well.",7,0,0,20 July 2015
Here Comes the Boom," Feel good movie and that is really what it does :)
","I think it can always go up and down with Kevin James, as a comedian and Series man he is very good, but at times the film he is in tends to be to long :) he is better at the sprint then the long distance usually, thats my humble opinion.I saw this with the misses (she always go for comedy given a choice), and we really found it was funny, it is kind of a comedian version of warrior (from 2011, one of the best fight films for MMA I have seen), it has nothing really new or ground breaking. It is solid comedy, with good acting, great characters, nice one liners, well basically the whole thing works and is entertaining for a good afternoon flick.You should see this, it is a classic feel good movie and that is really what it does :)",6,3,3,16 September 2015
Jurassic World," Back to being a kid at a theme park
","At the beginning I thought this was going to be a reboot of the series and that seemed a bit strange to me since the first film is not to be messed with, but now they say that they have written out the second and third film of history and this is a new sequel to the first one, and that makes so much sense. I must say that the second and third film wasn't that good compared to the first one, so this works out as a fine sequel to the first.Jurassic World have been running successfully in 10 years after the incidents at Jurassic Park, but guest count is declining, so they decide to create a new dinosaur, since they have run out of species to clone, this one is designed and is what they call a genetically modified hybrid, what can go wrong by creating your own bigger, stronger and with more teeth edition of a dinosaur.There are lot of good things to say about this film, but also a few things that doesn't work for it, luckily the good trumps the not so good, so all-in-all it becomes a very decent film with high entertainment value. The best part is actually that they continue the series as a new second film and that opens up for a lot of possibilities, but it is also the way that this is a big theme park and you really run along side Gray (Ty Simpkins) and want to see all the attractions and investigate all you can and see all there is to see. As a theme park this is really a cool place, with interesting rides, and great attractions, I especially like the hamster bubble for people, it is just something you really want to try yourself. Once again we are unfortunately stuck in the dilemma, that if you have this big facility and know that these are powerful and strong animals, why then create a bigger one and not account for the security precautions that are needed is a rookie mistake. So it worked for the first film because it was new and nobody had done it before, but this second time around, and since the park have been running for 10 successful years, they should know more about the game they are in and not make security mistakes, they should have calculations and preventive measure to make sure it can't happen.It is an entertaining film, there are a lot of fun moments and a lot of great fights between dinosaurs and in general a really great experience that takes you back to the age when you saw the first film in many ways. It can be enjoyed by old and new fans of dinosaurs and in my opinion you don't have to have seen the first film to know what it is all about.",8,7,21,11 June 2015
The Hangover Part II," ind of new packaging
","I thought this was going to be a poor repetition of the first Hangover movie, and yes there are a few events we have seen before, but all in a new package.Bradley, Ed, Zach and Justin is back, this time they spend time with some 'old' faces but we are also introduced to a few new ones. And yes they do it again, get very wasted and can't remember what happened and have to relive it all again.But it is kind of different, yes they are using old material, but it worked well the first time and it actually is okay the second time around also.",6,0,0,12 September 2015
Prisoners," Thrillingly good
","This film is though, suspenseful, raw and unbelievably real. It creeps up on you, slowly, like the speed of the film, it also moves slowly almost to calm you down and keep you relaxed yet very aware of what is going on and look closely at the events unfolding before you. The film is almost two and a half hour long, but in my mind it never seemed that way, it didn't get boring or trivial, it kept the suspense all the way through.If you have kids (I do), this is kind of the worst thing that could happen, what would you do, how would you react. The people in the film is just as different as you and me, they react differently, they get frustrated, they lunch out and to sum it up they do what they think is the right thing to do at the time, they do what they feel they have to do to get back what is taken from them.This is powerful acting, very believable and real, the characters and how they react, the way they go up and down, high on emotions, fueled by rage and frustrations. The choices they make and the solutions they choose individually affects the dynamic of their bonds, both family and friendship bonds a tried and tried hard. On the way the whole mood of the film and characters change, both by frustrations, lack of sleep, the lack of ability to go something about their situation. It is staggering and adds to the suspense and dark setting the film uncovers.I will not reveal anything about the movie itself, but if you have the stomach for abduction, skewed morals, the harsh facts of life and a very raw setting, if you can handle that (it is just a movie), then this is the film for you. It will keep you close to the edge of your seat.",9,1,2,10 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," In many ways I like this better then the first
","We need no introduction to the heroes them self, so the film starts of with a blast and jumps right into the action and the story, we get filled in on the details along the way, but some things a left unsaid and keeps possibilities open for further explanation or maybe spin-offs.The story of this is better then the first, there is a better red line to follow, we also get some nice flashbacks or dreams that shows us more about the characters and their hopes, fears and dreams. It kind of have some more intimate relations and Black Widow really gets to shine here, both in vulnerability, secure/insecure emotions and feelings and her past brings up stuff as well, It is nice to see more of the characters, even though a love story doesn't really fit in with this crowd.It is still just an action movie, but it is entertaining, filled with action and effects, a good story with some openings (what the f*ck happened in Budapest), humor and one liners as they should be.",7,4,10,7 May 2015
Friends with Benefits," Loud, dirty, sexy and good.
","This is the second one of it's kind I have seen this year, with this kind I mean friends- having-sex-just-for-fun-but-wanting-more kind of flicks, I think both of them are equally good, but in each their own way.In No strings attached with Natalie Portman as the leading female, it is more subtle and sweet, but this has a more becoming Mila Kunis approach, loud, dirty, sexy and good. So this has a few other view points, and is essentially the opposite of the other, except they both have the same theme and they more or less end the same way.In this the side characters are way better, especially Woody Harrelson is great, he is a very fun homosexual male, not to much in any way, but enough to make his point and a lot of good remarks. But it is also nice to see Jenna Elfman again, it's been a while and even though this doesn't give her the biggest scenes, she does very well and has a nice role.",8,0,2,21 December 2015
Elysium," Visually great film
","This film is one that Neil Blomkamp can be proud of in the visual sense, it has great visual effects, great CGI and is in many places very spectacular. He have also made a film that Sci-fi and action wise is a great movie, it really delivers both in a great combo. But writing is not Mr. Blomkamps strong suit I guess, the story is alright, but it doesn't really capture you and in some ways it is very... lets save the world, and all will be better if we just ...well it gets a bit to much.I liked the film in total, I thought it was very entertaining and had action, fights, gun battles etc. just as I had hoped for this Sci-fi universe, it was a good movie, but the end took it down a notch.Spoiler alert... I can say that I disliked the ending, why why why do we have to have a happy ending and everyone gets saved and so on and so forth. Stop after the line he is a citizen and cut all the crap about sending hospital vessels that are ready and standing by to earth and all that bullshit.",7,0,0,12 September 2015
Taken," The probability of one man doing all this...
","I had heard a lot about this movie, good and bad, but finally decided to see it and see what all the fuss was about. This film really puts the plot out there and puts a lot on the line, trafficking, prostitution, agents, weapons and a lot more. What really made an impression was the fact that they were very explicit in showing how and what, both when it came to the killings, the torture, but also the trafficking and the girls and drugs, it was very brutal, very fresh and very violent.It also has a very unrealistic side, with all the things that are very intense, the probability of one man doing all this (yes he is a former special agent), but it doesn't seem all believable, and when all is done he has taken maybe 50 lives, but there are no repercussions, no one comes after him, no police, no agency, no nothing.I loved it as a action movie and took it for what it is, then it works out very well and is very intense etc.",8,0,0,16 September 2015
Rio," It has a lot of things going for it
","This film is great, it has a lot of things going for it, the very rich details in the landscapes and the characters, but also the colors, voices, jokes and story.I saw it with my wife and kids, and even though the youngest one could sit still all the time, she still loved it and thought it was great.I especially liked the details, I haven't been to Rio, but I can imagine this gives very rich overview of the city. The colors and 'effects' where very great, and it brought this film all the way out in the theater hall. I also liked the very rich animal life, I mean there where a lot of different animals in this movie and that spiced it up and gave it life. It has a lot of imagination and characteristic just like all the different characters had in Ice Age.",8,0,0,25 December 2015
Limitless," The story has been told before, but not in this way
","The story has been told before, an addiction of a unknown substance that gives you special abilities, but not in this way. The substance in itself is not the main thing here, I think it's the story the whole film tells us, off-course this drug has a very special ability, but the issues that arises, complications of being on drugs and how it all goes up and down could have been in any other drug related story in one form or another.Who is to say, that this is just one drug, this could symbolize the wast number of drugs that properly is used in every layer of the society today, performers of the great arts that take drugs to keep on training and performing, athletes that take performance enhancing drugs, financial guys that take endurance drugs or something else.I'm just saying, this drug is not real (yet, it might be some day), but I presume that lots of people have a drug they are addicted to, it could be drug drugs or it could be smoking, checking facebook every 10 minutes, drinking lots of water etc. Every drug has it's ups and downs and who wouldn't want to have this drug, and the abilities it brings, maybe not the downsides of it, but else....Well this is a great film, with good acting, several messages and entertaining, even if you don't want to think that much about it (maybe I thought to much into it), it's still entertaining and exciting.",7,0,0,21 December 2015
Beauty and the Beast," I was very moved by this, maybe I was in a vulnerable state ...

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," I love this universe
","Both these film are great, mostly because of the crazy universe, the 80 references, the music, the humor, the characters and the colours :) This is now as great as the first, but it has to do with the god like creatures concept that I really find difficult, won't spoil anything ... so won't go deeper into that. The opening scenes is just fantastic, really cute, exhilarating and fits perfectly with the film.Location, seating & time: Cinemaxx, København, Denmark - Bio 4, row H seat 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 & 12 - 27.04.2017 at 19.00",8,1,3,14 September 2017
Love Actually," Classic movie to see during Christmas holidays
","I saw this again this Christmas, don't know how many times I have seen it, but it is a very enjoyable, funny, strange, British Christmas flick.Different stories that crosses paths, containing odd characters, unlikely scenarios, fun and different happenings, and it is all in the name of the holiday spirit and has romance and comedy written in all the time.It is a very lovely film, with some very lovely actors that really makes all the small moments shine and seem awkward, silly, strange, fun and different.",7,1,2,5 January 2016
12 Years a Slave," Though, Strong and the Heart in the right place
","This is a though movie to go through, it has so many scenarios where you think no that couldn't have happened and then again you keep watching the hate and cruel intentions over and over again. It is a strong movie and kind of a heartless but also heart filled movie in many cases, there are ups and downs and a very strong believe and determination all the way.The scenes are really beautiful, and the characters really well acted, there are these small things here and there that makes the audience either like or hate the characters more. Benedict Cumberbatch is a slaver, but he tries to be a good man, Michael Fassbender is though and a general a-hole, there is this scene where he leans on the head of one of his slaves. Its these small things that make the characters the way they are and really divides them into 'good' and 'evil'.",8,0,1,8 June 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," Plenty of entertainment
","There is just something about the Barden Bellas, maybe it is the strange combination of weirdos, maybe it is because it is fun and serious at the same time, maybe it is just because it is all the songs you know in a cappella.We know the characters for this movie, we just get to see more of them, their different and weird persona, their outbursts and strange behavior and much more. They are as I remember them from the first film and it is a joyful re-visit into this crowd of beautiful, strange, weird, loud, mousy, happy and funny people. The scene is a bit different, for one the mean opposing a cappella group is German and the whole music competition is in Denmark, from a man who come from Denmark and live in Denmark that is not how it is here, a bit more fairytale a bit less weirdness and I have never heard of any a cappella competitions, maybe a few groups, but that is it :)I was entertained, not as much as the first, they also had a bit to live up to, but this is still a good film, funny film and plenty of entertainment.",7,6,9,14 August 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Drugs, parties, ladies, money and drugs
","A rise and fall movie as Martin Scorsese does it best, with him at the wheel and Leonardo Dicaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie and Matthew McConaughey just to mention a few of the great actors in this all cramped in to this spectacular Wallstreet Real Estate, it doesn't get any better for most parts of the film.I love the drama, the twist and turns, everything is fine and then attitude, drugs, parties, ladies, money and drugs (well there are a lot, had to mention them twice).Great film, great directing, great acting, all is just great great great. This is one to watch, why don't you give this man an Oscar soon :) he don't need it he is proving again and again that he doesn't need it to be the great actor that he truly is.",8,0,3,15 March 2015
Defiance," This one is good
","This is a beautiful movie in many ways, also a very violent and sad one.The story in itself is a good one, it has it all, friendship, love (both brotherly and family), fighting, war and a lot more.The sceneries are very good, there are scenes in the forest that are really special and beautiful but only in the quiet moments. The war scenes are very rough and dirty as they should be.The cast is very good in this movie and to see a good danish actor in it was, well actually a surprise, I didn't know Iben Hjejle was in this one. I'm not a big history fan, but movies that are good, based on true events always make me want to find out more and read up-on-it :)",7,1,2,28 March 2016
The Secret Life of Pets," Lovely insight in their secrets :)
","Much of this film was as I expected it, basically the story is a very basic one, everything is good, the days go by as they use too, but hen trouble occurs and it turns the story around, but you have to see that for yourself :)It has some great characters, mostly cute and cuddly, but also a few bad ones, they could be even more evil for my sake, but they are very kids friendly kind of villainous.It is fun and games all the way, the entire family really liked it and we had a very good time in the movies with this one. The Danish voices are really good, but I will be looking forward to seeing it in English when it comes out on DVD/Streaming.Location, seating & time: Atlas, Rødovre, Denmark - Bio 2, row 6 seat 1, 2, 4 & 6 - 14.08.2016 at 13.20",7,1,1,22 September 2016
Finding Dory," I wasn't disappointed that much
","Pixar still got it, there has been a lot of animations this year, but this was the one I expected the most from and I wasn't disappointed that much :)It is always hard following up on a huge success like Finding Nemo, but Pixar is good at making sequels and this one was also really good, gave us some new aspects, some new characters and as always a lot of feelings.This was a great film, everyone in the family was delightfully entertained, both about the story, the characters, scenery, well basically everything. But I couldn't help being a little disappointed, I had set my hopes too high.Location, seating & time: Nordisk Film Fields, Amager, Denmark - Bio 2, row 8 seat 1, 2, 3 & 4 - 18.09.2016 at 13.00",7,2,8,22 September 2016
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Wonderful Weird
","It is hard finding the right words to write about this film, it is just something you have to experience for yourself, maybe you will like it and maybe it is just too weird for some. It is a very weird film in many ways, the camera angels and flows are something new, individual and intertwined stories, strange compositions and difficult personalities are just some of the things we experience in this film.It is very well done, has a strange twist of irony, mentioning cinematically and society related references and have reality distant illusions, it is all in all a great mix of fun, weird, fact and strange :)The small universe or the way it is presented for the viewer is great, we mainly follow the main person, earlier movie actor Birdman, some of it is his thoughts, some is inside his head and how he perceive things and some is from the views of other people. It is all shown in this one-take kind of camera motion and that gives us a notion off being close to these people and moving in the same space as them.In many ways this film is just good craftsmanship, cinematically, scenery, mood and music plays well together, especially the last part, the music and sounds have an impact on us and the actors, we meet the musician in the film and he is part of the whole experience, it is just one of the extra weird things in this small universe.It is very entertaining and you sometimes sit there with open mouth through longer scenes of the film (maybe through it all, I didn't notice), it is entertaining and exciting and you have to follow closely both to get it all, but also to just enjoy the strangeness and different style.",8,1,6,31 January 2015
The Big Short," For a film about banking...
","... this is actually not bad, they have also spiced it up a bit and made it fact based comedy in a sense and that actually keeps it more interesting. The film moves fast, and if you are a little behind in the world of banking, real estate loans and loans, this is mostly a lot of people talking really fast and using a lot of acronyms (that is explained for us common people, in a funny way). These funny clips, either were something is explained or the story teller and actors are talking to the audience, that works out quite well and keeps the story up on its beat.The actors are good, we are dealing with great people, playing each their own special character and they really keep the story together, keeps it interesting even though the plot of the film is a bit boring. It is not comedy in any traditional sense, but they do make it fun to see and entertaining all-in-all.Location, seating & time: Dagmar, Nordisk Film, Vesterbro, Denmark - Bio 5, row 8 seat 2 & 4 - 15.02.2016 at 15.00",7,0,1,18 February 2016
The Conjuring," This was my first Horror movie in the movie theater
","I have always seen these at home, but the big screen, loud noises and total darkness just makes this so much better :) I haven't seen his earlier work like Insidious (but am going to now for sure), have seen Saw but that is something different in my mind, this was a very classic horror movie, the build up, the suspense, the revealing and the fast end (horror movies tend to have that).The acting, the characters, the music, the scenery it all fits very well together in this one, we get a good introduction to both the Perron and the Warren families and both have their own small pieces of the big picture, but also kind of separate stories within. I didn't sit on the edge of my seat, but I did jump a few times, this was a classic horror story telling with the music that plays a big role in the build up and the sudden reveal of 'something' that makes you jump.",8,1,2,12 September 2015
The Woman in Black," Thriving on the dark and scary
","Brilliant acting by both Daniel Radcliffe but also the rest of the cast and crew, this film is really thriving on the dark and scary mood of all the characters, some are angry, some are scared, some are helpful, but they all live with the fear of the unknown, of what is have been and are happening at the village and the house.That being said, this is a somewhat classic horror film in many ways, the dark and shadows play a big hand in the settings, the creepy slow music and noises play with your mind and the glimpse of something that might or might not be there gives your eyes something to look after. When it all plays together as it does in this film, you get the thrills, the jumping moments and the creepiness and that is what defines a good horror flick.",7,1,4,17 February 2015
The Wolverine," Something wasn't right
","This film does something new with Wolverine, it gives him some emotion and some feelings, this is actually good, but even though the film still has a lot of action and fighting, it didn't really live up to my expectations.I liked the film for the new twist and the story, I liked all the action parts, lots of good fighting scenes and different kind of action then we usually see with the Wolverine. But I liked the first Wolverine better and it set my expectations a bit higher then they should have been maybe.I was entertained and liked it, but something was missing, something wasn't right with this installment of the franchise.",6,1,3,10 June 2015
The Croods," Lets just say that this family is different
","The Croods take place many years ago in a prehistoric time that should be like the stone age on planet earth and at the same time it presents creatures, colors and scenery that is not of this earth :) Lets just say that this family is different, they are strange and yet peculiar familiar, they are a good blend of characters and they live in an interesting world.There are great animations, it might not be like a Disney classic or Pixar film, but Dreamworks really hits the spot with this different and sometimes weird family animation film. It is very entertaining and the characters are both charming, likable and sometimes strange, but they fit into the story and experience a lot of new stuff and that keeps you interested and watching all the way.",8,0,0,15 September 2015
Monsters University," It is hard to live up to the rep of the first movie
","In this prequel to Monsters inc, we get to see how Mike and Sulley become friends and a team of sorts at the end, because in the beginning they are not exactly that.This film has much to offer and as many other animation films it has a lot for both kids and grownups, We get to meet a whole bunch of new characters and some of the 'old' ones but in their youth. It was very entertaining for the entire family and filled with joy and pranks and much more, a very nice film and a very good introduction to the monsters world and their way of education :)It is hard to live up to the rep of the first movie and in general my expectations are very high for films from Pixar and Disney, so it gets a little lower rating then the first one.",7,0,0,10 June 2015
Toy Story 3," It does become a bit sad
","Pixar really knows a good story and how to tell it, so that both kids and grown ups get entertained and caught up in it. This is a film that is as good as the two previous ones and even though the toys are further away from home then they have ever been, it still feels very much as it did ten years ago :)There are some great new things in this, especially Barbies new found friend Ken gets to show of a little and really is a fine new character. Actually they are all great new characters, some more trust worthy then others, but all with great voices and personalities.This is as the other Toy Stories, very very good for both small and big, I and my kids really love all three movies, even though this is a bit sad.",8,0,1,15 September 2015
Thor: The Dark World," See it for the action, the effects and for the women maybe the body of Thor
","Action & Effects, those two things are really what there is most of in this film, there are some great scenes and fun moments, but it is best when everything is being hammered or shot to smithereens.When the story was only on earth and a bit in Asgard it worked better, all these worlds that collide and align, I don't know I think the story in this is a bit vague, there are some good parts with the scientist and their discoveries in London, but other then that it is all about the action and effects.I was entertained, but it was missing some story, see it for the action, the effects and for the women maybe the body of Thor :)",6,0,1,8 June 2015
Lucy," The border to the Matrix have been crossed, and it is not good
","I have enjoyed many films starring Scarlett Johansson and taken in many action packed scenes and films by Luc Besson. So this collaboration was really something I was looking forward to, but it ruins it for itself, it simply falls apart the further we move towards the end.I really like the first 'half' of the movie, it has a nice premise and there are some really good and interesting scenes, as long as we are in the theoretically phase and within the grasp of what might happen it actually works out. As soon as we step into the place where no one can predict what might happen if we are able to use about 40% or more of our brain capacity, the chains that links the story, reality and the entire film breaks.There are some very nice action and fighting scenes in between, but all the mind expanding and knowledge gaining and control is simply too weird and out of touch with anything you would believe will actually be possible.",5,0,2,24 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I love this new chapter
","It is great to be back in this universe, I have been waiting for something new for a while, I guess many people have :) I love this new chapter, not a dull moment, many great characters and a lot of nostalgia that reminds me of the original three films.I love that they brought back the original characters, that they are continuing the story where it fits the ages of the actors from the old films, but the new characters and actors fit in really well to the story and it is going to be a joy following them in the next films.If you like Star Wars, this is just a great chapter, I think with a little explanation you are able to start from this chapter, if you are not into the 'old' ones.",8,3,27,26 July 2016
Flight," Very dramatic and realistic
","This is a great film, it was very entertaining and very dramatically at times, but most of all it was very well acting from all and especially Whip Whitaker played by Denzel Washington is a great character.It is actually the performance of Denzel that really keeps this film together, it is very nuanced and balances out the plot and story that could have needed a little more work I guess.Very realistic, well you hope nothing like this happens to you. Very entertaining, in the way that it is good acting and intense the follow.Basically a great film, because of a lot of things, so you should watch this if you haven't already, it has a lot of interesting aspects.",8,2,4,12 September 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Entertaining and vivid all the way
","I really enjoyed this film, I haven't read the books, but maybe I should :) The character play in this film is still very strong, all the characters really unfold more and show their good and bad sides. I liked the story, but hate why everything has to end on a cliff hanger at the moment, we know that there is coming more films, why do we have to be like awww couldn't they just have shown a little more.Entertaining and vivid all the way, it was nice watching it and be entertained. Evil unfolds from many directions, it is not evil, it is more a question of power. Kindness and Respect is still fine traits that are upheld, from several people, fighting back is just part of the revolution.",7,1,10,9 June 2015
Godzilla," Re-invented, for all the people that haven't seen the originals
","This film doesn't bring anything new to the franchise as such, but it does re-invent it for all the people that haven't seen the originals (maybe because they weren't born or because they don't see them as classics), this is better then the remake from 1998 and it really tells the story very well.In the beginning it feels like it is very mystical and I was almost afraid that this would turn into a film like Cloverfield where you don't actually see the beast or beasts, only in very short clips. With the CGI today we don't need to hide the big monsters that could seem fake away, because they are really realistic, in the way they look, in the way they move and how they affect their surroundings. I think this has been done very well and even though their is a lot of dark places, it is only to help the imagination kick into overdrive, when these big giants fight :)I was entertained, the entire build up was very elaborate and believable, it was a good introduction to the film and the genre and how it was tried to cover things up with events that actually have happened. The story of the film supports the events very well and a kind of mad scientist to discover or reveal parts of the myths woks out very well.",8,0,2,17 February 2015
Looper," Greatly performed by primarily Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis
","This is a very interesting story, and that is the main thing in this, the story and the way it is told. It is always difficult to entirely believe a story when it has something to do with the ability to time travel, this skips the way of time travel, but simply states that is has been invented in the future and is banned there, but still used by criminal organizations to send back individuals there for reason needs to disappear. Loopers are people that in the present or near present is at the right time at the right place to kill the individuals send back, fairly simple concept.The story and the way it loops and unfold is very interesting, it tells an almost linear story, but jumps a few times, just like a dream or dejavu. There are small hints and lines that unfolds and in total creates the entire picture of the things that happen in the past will affect the future, for better or worse.This is a great sci-fi and action movie, it is greatly performed by primarily Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, but also Emily Blunt has an interesting part and performs it well. It is interesting and entertaining, in a very simple and elegant way.",7,0,0,19 September 2015
Deadpool," Have never laugh at so much violence before
","I knew it was going to be violent, well because of the rating, but this film is crazy violent and still you are laughing at all that happens, it is absurd how fun it is when somebody is punched, kicked, hacked, slashed, shoot or crushed, as long as it is served with a smile and a snappy remark it all works out. That is one thing this film is full of, action/violence and everything is served with a snappy remarks, a joke and a smile :) and it just works, my son is not going to see this any time soon, but I loved it a lot that is for sure.I have always liked Ryan Renolds and in this film he really goes all in or maybe out to be the best 'super hero' he can be as long as he doesn't get a green suit he is all good.Location, seating & time: Imperial, Nordisk Film, Vesterbro, Denmark - Bio 1, row 14 seat 3 & 5 - 22.02.2016 at 16.10",9,4,17,4 March 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Cool, Fun, Stylish and Action packed
","This film is an experience and like many others one you have to see in the movie theater, it is very rich in style, great sound, sharp images and fast moving, over the top action. Many things are in just the correct amount, some just to the edge, but it never gets too much, it becomes much, but it fits the timing of the film and it is glorious. There clearly is a very big love and respect for the spy genre and they clearly have very good control of their references to earlier works like James Bond, Jason Bourne and others. It is a very classic English spy, spiced up with some young British talent and an American villain wit a lisp :)All of the actors do a very fine job, the guys with the routine, Colin Firth, Michael Cain, Mark Strong and Samuel L. Jackson all do a fine job and they are playing parts that we don't experience them in every day, but it fits them very well. The young Taron Egerton who takes the lead role is also doing a fine job and we will be seeing more of him in the future, I think.",8,4,11,14 March 2015
The Hangover Part III," This is a fine ending to the series
","if it is the last (who knows), but it wasn't as funny as the previous ones, yes there are still a lot of laughs and it is entertaining, but the hangover is missing in this one.I don't know if that's what's really missing, the hangover part I mean, but there is something taken away by it not being there. I understand why they have skipped that part and maybe made this more of a closing argument and for that it works out well, but I guess I just wanted more :)We just wanted to be entertained and surprised like the first movie, not in this lets make it more outrages and unbelievable kind of way.",5,0,0,12 September 2015
Easy A," Doesn't deliver big laughs, but much other
","This film is a good comedy, it doesn't deliver big laughs, but it does deliver fast comments, funny remarks, comedy scenes with a twist and is all-in-all a great, witty, sweet and inventive teen movie.Emma Stone has a great part in making Olive Penderghast seem like an ordinary teen, with a great family and trying to help others, but is misunderstood and taking her newly found 'popularity' to extremes. This film is very entertaining and funny, it has some great characters played by good actors and actresses, a fine story and a winning personality (if that is possible for a film).I like it for its subtle humor, funny remarks and twist and turns along the way.",7,0,0,16 April 2015
Minions," It is a great introduction to these strange beings
","Following these weird beings on their way to finding a master is an enjoyable journey, but not as weird as I had thought it would be, for good & worse I guess :) They are strange and crazy characters and with this fictional race and their strange 'universe', well they do live on earth, but have a life of their own and a language of their own (witch everybody apparently understands).It is not as funny as Despicable me, maybe it is because we know these crazy characters, so they are not that mysterious, but their way into world of villains and evil masters are unlike something you have seen before, that is what makes it interesting, new and funny.This film is one you can see the entire family, it does have a lot of fun for both big and small, and it is a great introduction to these strange beings and how they got closer to the way we know them from despicable me.",7,1,2,12 September 2015
Spectre," Ian Fleming would have been proud
","This is bond as it should be, I have always been a big fan of the classic spy tales and this film really goes back to being the more classy, slick, humorist and calm bond that I really like. The entire film is more bond then some of the recent films, it has the evil villain and his henchmen, the remote base in a spectacular but weird location, great action scenes with fighting, shooting and explosions and off course dry humor and martinis.This kind of reminds me of Moonraker, not many people are all that about that film, but I loved it as a child, going to a strange base, meeting a real villain and his strange henchman with the silver teeth, it was enjoyable and fun and I was truly entertained back then. As I was with this film, it has the same features and it goes more classic, where some of the other have been more trying to be more Bourne like action films.It is hard to tell what will happen to the franchise and how bond will continue, but if they continue on this path and making films this way, these will become classics as the old ones with Sean Connery and Roger Moore.Location, seating & time: Review for the Press, Imperial, Nordisk Film, Vesterbro, Denmark - Bio 1, row 14 seat 4 - 27.10.2015 at 09.00",8,2,7,12 January 2016
Moon," weird+weird+weird+weird = very nice film
","A weird film, a weird plot, weird happenings and one weird actor :) It all adds up actually, weird+weird+weird+weird = very nice film.This is a strange film at first, but many things become more clear on the way, it raises a lot of questions and not all is answered, but that doesn't matter for this film. It is beautiful, both in scenery and in acting, it is gripping yet slow moving and time really seem to move very slowly both on the moon and for the viewers.It is entertaining, fascinating and a somewhat realistic sci-fi, the space station brings me back to a mix between Aliens and A Space Odyssey, it is very cool and very fitting for this movie.",8,0,2,10 June 2015
Her," Speaking to your senses
","What I really like about this film is the way it speaks to you senses, it uses very bright colors and I don't know if the angles or something else, but the way the scenes are filmed just seems different. The music score fits really well, have a relaxing effect and combined with the smooth voice of Scarlett Johansson for the operating system it's just perfect.It is a slow paced movie, that really speaks to all senses (well not smell), it is thought provoking and a quit real possibility in the not so distant future. Very nice acting by Joaquin Phoenix, smooth voice by Scarlett Johansson and really nice directing by Spike Jonze.Entertaining, fun, strange, futuristic, special, some of the words that can be used about it.",8,0,2,14 March 2015
The Nice Guys," They are nice, to some :)
","Matching Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling in this awkward partnership actually works out very well, they are very true to their character, both a bit off in their own way, but together they really are the nice guys :)It is the funniest film I have seen in a long time and it really deserves a lot of credit for keeping a good story and not just relying on slap-stick humor, it has both subtle and loud comedy, it has action and something going on all the time, but above all it has timing and precision in the way it delivers the story and how the characters handle the different situations.Location, seating & time: Kinopalæet, Lyngby, Denmark - Bio 3, row 9 seat 3 & 5 - 27.06.2016 at 19.00",8,42,72,26 July 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," This is crazy in so many ways
","Insane action packed, two hour road rage movie, that more or less sums up this crazy film, George Miller still got it, coming back after 30 years and making this in just the right spirit and with all it entails is amazing.This film is an instant classic, even though a film where they drive around for two hours sounds like something that gets boring, it just introduces new strange characters, one more crazy then the next all the time and keeps the action and tempo at a very high gear. I was entertained from the beginning all the way to the end and there was enough to see and think about on the way, caught myself sitting with open mouth and a big grin on my face many times.The acting is not deep, but there are many characters, one more crazy and strange until the next one shows up, how did they find all these crazy people and drag them out into the deserted lands miles from civilization. Well actually there isn't much acting for most parts or not in matter of lines, the only one that really pulls through on this is Charlize Theron, she delivers a good performance, is a tough girl and still keeps the glimpse in her eye. Tom Hardy on the other hand more or less grunts through the first half and gets a few more lines through the rest, but he does deliver a good performance as the main male character, crazy, mad or driven to insanity of sorts, Max is his name :) The young Nux played by Nicholas Hoult also does a great job, we see the world through different perspectives through his eyes, first as the mechanic that wants to be accepted into Valhalla and later he finds that there is other ways.Hugh Keays-Byrne plays Immortan Joe, don't know if he is the only one, but he was also in the first Mad Max movie from 1979, I think it was missing a Camio from Mel Gibson or Tina Turner, that would have been a fun surprise.All in all bang for the buck, really nicely topped of with visuals and music that just fits perfect into this desolate wasteland and crazy character scenario, two thumbs up from me and a big happy smile.",10,6,15,20 May 2015
Warcraft," Fantasy film with a lot to tell
","I haven't been gaming Warcraft in a long time, but just thinking back on the old games before World of Warcraft really brings good memories and I was hoping (before seeing the film) this film would not ruin those. I can truly say that it didn't, this is a good film, the characters are what they are, most know them or the side they represent, the story is true, the scenery's and the character visuals in this film are really good and really what brings this fantasy to life, it is like watching a big video game unfold and you wish you could control some of the characters at times :)Location, seating & time: Cinemaxx, Copenhagen, Denmark - Bio IMAX, row I seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 - 13.06.2016 at 18.20",7,0,0,26 July 2016
The Great Gatsby," I have never read The Great Gatsby
","I know of the story but nothing more then that, so I was totally oblivion to what to expect and what the story was about. I figured that this was going to be a long drama with romantic episodes and a story that would be interesting but not filled with any surprises as such.The settings of this story is very good, it is very extravagant and fancy at the big mansions, very lively, jazzy and vulgar in New York City and down to earth, dirty and different in the coal production between them.The Jazz music is great, new songs that you know but in a jazz setting and sound, it works very well for the big mansion settings, the parties and the the smaller New York City apartments and really give the movie extra life.The movie is moving slow, not that nothing is happening and parts of the movie is certainly happening and screaming and shouting, but the story behind it all is a slow one and in my opinion a bit boring.All-in-all the film is entertaining, but it becomes a bit long and tedious, I liked most parts of it, but it didn't capture me as other big dramas have done before, it is mostly an okay movie.",6,0,2,12 September 2015
Warm Bodies," New good twist on the genre
","This is something different, a zombie movie but a Romantic Comedy at that, and a movie where it for most parts take the Zombie side, shows what he/they think and do and how they live.The genre being comedy might be a bit off, yes it has humor and funny moments, but it is mostly small laughs not big ones, and there is many moments where it is more in drama mode and maybe even action mode, well maybe comedy suits it all right.This is a new good twist on the genre, there are good performances by all the actors, especially the main characters R played by Nicholas Hoult and Julie played by Teresa Palmer do a very nice job, but also the side characters have great personalities and characteristics.",7,1,2,12 September 2015
Alien: Covenant," I liked this one
","I am a fan of Alien and I do like Prometheus, this actually does a great job of linking the films better together in my opinion. The first Aliens was really scary, maybe because I was a young kid, these new films are not the same, but I like them for their new way of scarring the audience.Location, seating & time: Cinemaxx, København, Denmark - Bio Imax, row B seat 14 & 16 - 15.05.2017 at 18.00",7,2,2,14 September 2017
Furious 7," Paul Walker tribute
","I think they have made a nice recovery of the film, and really made a big tribute to Paul Walker through out the film.Since they started doing good again in this franchise (the fifth film), they have really delivered a solid product with a good storyline, plenty of hard hitting action and all the beautiful cars and voluptuous ladies in miniskirts and bikinis that you could wish for. This is in the same caliber, it has a lot of focus on the action and that works out in many ways, both with and without cars. The story is actually also quite fitting and adds a lot of details and together with the beautiful scenery, the bass pumping music and the ode to a great guy (Paul Walker), it is just a good movie, fast moving, high impact and a lot of adrenaline.I found it very entertaining, with a lot of great things, maybe it gets a bit sentimental, but it is alright and fits the story well.",7,0,13,8 June 2015
