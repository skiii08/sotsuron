Hereditary," I will never see this movie again!!
","I think this is new kind of horror film, and among horror films are shown this year, this film is the best. No ghost, no jump-scare and the most important thing, it has plot, it has meaning. The connection inside this film is started at the beginning of the film, and during the time you watch it, you will watch, you will feel the same feeling, will have the same emotion and you don't know what you're facing to? The grandmother, kind of. The daughter, maybe. And every details in this film have their own meaning, you have to focus, think about them and you'll be explained at the end of this movie. I watched this film alone, with my headphone, i beg that i had trully experienced with the feeling what-i-am-afraid-of. I love this film and i was engrossed in watching this film during 2 hours. It's totally worth it.",10,7,12,21 September 2018
A Quiet Place," It's worth watching! Highly recommended!
","I'm very impressed by the trailer and some reviews written on internet so i made decision to watch this movie immediately. 
I think this move is a brand new kind of horror movie, it has something we would scared and screamed while watching this movie, also it talks about a family and the role of father and mother are the lead of a family, the way they protected their children, how they understand each other and how they showed their love with each other. Especially the last scene, after showing the daughter that he loved her so much, he died as a hero to protect his children. 
I think this movie was successful in making this character - the father. Ahhhh family factors in this fim were perfect. 
But thing i don't like about this movie is the ending. I wish it was longer or they could somehow explain why on earth has those kind of 'monster'. I am still confused with the ending.",9,2,3,25 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Love is always beautiful, no matter what!
","First time seeing a gay movie, and i have to admit that i'm totally into it. I've heard this movie from a book and luckily it has a vietnamese version, i've finished reading that book. Complex emotions i got when reading that book, which combine with this movie, the music, sences, conversations between Elio and Oliver make me love this movie than ever. 
How human can fall in love with each other is a kind of mystery, and how to know or how to express that love, i think we must be the professior in this major. After watching 'Call me by your name', i think that words help us understand each other, actions help and teach us love each other. It's true to say that we're grown up when we fall in love.
Omg i'm so in love with this movie, with Elio, with Oliver.",10,3,6,7 September 2018
