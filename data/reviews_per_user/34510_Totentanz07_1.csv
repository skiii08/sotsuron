The Ring," Not since The Exorcist
","the scariest movie ever since! i just hope this will boost Naomi Watts's Oscar profile for 21 Grams. It would be something if another Australian actress wins for this year. Also, what made the movie so attractive is its Japanese-based story line. I'm from Asia, and its too bad not everyone in the world can see the talent in movie making there.",10,1,1,26 June 2003
