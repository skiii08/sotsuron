The Legend of Bagger Vance," Pretty Good, Redford movies are better when he isn't in them.
","The last movie I saw which Redford directed was The Horse Whisperer. Redford showed himself too much and the movie could have been edited down to about half its length.  This one doesn't have Redford in it, so he does a pretty good job of keeping the pace moving.  Matt Damon is a great actor, but only good here. As an avid golfer I would have to say his swing is fairly flawed and the way he leaves his hips out means there is absolutely no way he could hit a golf ball 300 yards. However, his swing was perfect for the scenes where he was shanking the ball left and right. So I will give him a C grade on the golfing portion of his acting.  Damon pulled off everything thing else with an A-. He was very good and had great chemistry with Charlize Theron.  Her accent was off a bit, but not bad for someone from South Africa. Charlize gets a B.
Will Smith was a natural in his role and the highlight of the movie.  Every moment he spent on the screen was perfect. A+ for Will.
Redford's direction was pretty good, but there were a few gaffes which are worth mentioning.  Golf balls from the 20's did not have dimples. The close-ups of the balls showed 90's style golfs balls. This was quite lame. They were not made from polymers which made dimples possible until the late 40's.  The balls were rubber on the outside and they would not have flown 300 yards if King Kong were hitting them with a wooden shafted club. 
These technical glitches can be put aside because this movie wasn't really about golf they say.  Well I say don't put golf in the story if you aren't going to do it right.  Redford gets a B-.  Which is far from the D- I gave him for The Horse Whisperer.  Nice improvement Bob, Now remember to keep yourself out of the movies you direct.",7,0,1,20 November 2000
Erin Brockovich," What a great film
","After seeing a brutal Mission to Mars, this film is just wonderful.  I am normally an action movie junkie, but the writing in this film is fantastic. The dialog is witty, snappy, and creative.  It was a very credible movie. Just when I was losing all faith in Hollywood, Julia Roberts pulls out the best performance of her career and brings me back into the mix. I loved this movie.  Go see it. Sit back and enjoy true to life dialog and a great true story. Albert Finney is top notch in his supporting role as well. He fit the role perfectly and his facial expressions make the whole story work.  It is isn't often that the kids are realistic, and these kids must have moved in with Julia for a while because they were so cozy together.  It didn't seem awkward like, for example, Jake Lloyd is Star Wars.  Great JOB by all!",9,1,1,19 March 2000
Meet the Parents," I still don't know what to say.
","I have to comment about this movie.  It wasn't really funny.  It seems everyone seems to think it is.  I thought it had some funny moments, but many others were just so-so.  The full house audience in the theatre I was in didn't laugh as much as I did, so I figure it didn't go over really well with them either.The Movie might be more funny if I had never seen another one, but I have. So when a movie beats you to a bloody pulp with the jokes before they even happen, it loses the laugh.  The dialogue in place was good, but I just kept knowing that certain things were going to happen.EXAMPLES: ( SPOILERS )  We know from the moment they get there that the CAT is going to be a MAJOR joke prop.  What is it with Ben Stiller and evil animals?  I KNEW from the moment the urn was mentioned it would be broken, I KNEW the cat would not use the toilet the whole movie.  I KNEW Ben Stiller would end up on the roof smoking.  I KNEW it would probably result in something bad happening.  I KNEW the stupid wooden alter would end up defamed in some way.  I could go on all day.  These things were set-up with such bluntness that Helen Keller could see the sight gags coming.While I did laugh at some points, overall I was really disappointed.  The only way to make something funny is to catch the audience off guard with a new twist.  There were none in this film.P.S. Deniro is VERY Funny.  Maybe one of the top five comedians in Hollywood.  HE did make me laugh.4 of 10.",4,3,4,13 October 2000
10 Things I Hate About You," Very entertaining
","Julia Stiles was great from moment one of this film. Heath Ledger is the best new actor in Hollywood. I loved him in the Patriot as well. I was a little afraid of this film because it seems geared to the teenager, so I waited until I was in the mood. I laughed a whole lot during this one. The Cast in total deserves applause.7 of 10.Go rent it!I still love this movie...and I have now seen it at least 25 times! Alyson Janney's performance makes me laugh more each and every time I see it. I appreciate it more now that I have become such a fan of West Wing. Her character in this movie is NOTHING like that, but instead very funny. February 28, 2005!",7,0,0,25 July 2000
Cast Away," Another Great one from Zemeckis
","I Love his movies.  They are filled with detail.  Sometimes you don't realize until a day or two later how much detail is dropped into a Zemeckis film.  It is in the details that his stories are really brought to life. At face value I would have given Cast Away a 5 of 10 as an average movie.  Then I started rolling over it in my head and when I awoke from a realistic dream about that tiny island Tom Hanks was deserted on I knew it was more the first washes across you.  You have to watch it more than once I decided. You HAVE to look for all the details.  The religious symbolism.  The Major Zemeckis theme throughout many of his films: Fate versus Free Will.  The Man Vs. Nature.  The Comedy is an average man's faults.  These are the things a Bob Zemeckis film explores and makes you feel.  I loved this film. I give it a nomination for Best Director and I give it 50-50 odds of winning. I nominate it for Best Picture.  It will be a close race with Almost Famous and The Grinch.  Tom Hanks is definitely a nominee for Best Actor.  He was simply REAL.  There is no better performance this year.  Maybe an equal, but no better performance.  Amazing.As I said, at first glance I didn't like it much.  The ending was something I didn't like.  After some time to re-think it through I think the ending is brilliant.  This is one of the three best films of 2000.  Go see it for yourself.",8,0,0,28 December 2000
U-571," Excellent Action Movie
","Attention would be Hollywood Directors:  If you want to see how a great action movie is done, Watch U-571! The Directing was top notch.  Having seen many other WWII movies, I was greatly impressed with the way the director took some of his plot tools and scenery tools from movies of the past and incorporated them in a newly creative way.  The Cinematography was of extreme high quality.  The Cast was just perfect.  Matthew McConaughey had a great performance, I didn't detect even a trace of Wooderson in him in this role.  He was a deadly serious Naval Officer, and he pulled it off with flying colors.  Harvey Keitel, Jake Weber, David Keith, Bill Paxton, and little known Dave Power, who was excellent as the mechanic, all put in great supporting performances.On the critical side of things, some will say that it wasn't the true story. They would be correct, it is pretty clear after you watch the movie that the writer/director took the story from several of these missions and put together an outstanding action movie, with some historical relevance, but not actually telling a 'true' story.  I don't have a problem with this, but some will.Overall, if you like action movies, I recommend this one.",7,1,3,25 April 2000
The Patriot," This is Excellent Cinema
","These guys do not make a movie without excellent sound effects.  Way to go Roland and Dean!  Mel Gibson is awesome as usual and the rest of the cast is great as well.  The Revolutionary War is no nearly as overdone as other Wars so this was a GREAT fourth of July week experience. Jason Issacs is the perfect Villian as Col. Tavington and Tom Wilkinson has a stunning performance as Gen. Cornwallis.The movie was quite creative, the Battle scenes were gripping. GO SEE IT NOW.  If you have already seen it GO AGAIN.  This movie and Gladiator are the two must sees of the summer.",9,1,2,30 June 2000
