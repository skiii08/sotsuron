10 Cloverfield Lane," Ending was disappointing
","Great build-up of suspense and horror, and then you have an ending with cheesy graphics and fight scenes reminscent of a cheesy 90s action flick. So bad.",7,0,0,21 January 2020
The Orphanage," A lot of buildup for nothing
","I gave a few extra stars for the acting and cinematics. However, the plot was severely lacking. You have the cliche of a child who sees ghosts, I would be able to forgive that if the plot was interesting. I kept watching, so much buildup to another cheesy scenario...a seance. And the scary part was supposed to be hearing the screams of children behind some door. This does not do anything for seasoned horror fans like myself. The only scary part of the movie was the old lady after the accident. The ending was ok, but the whole movie itself was stretched out too long.",3,0,0,14 June 2020
Prisoners," Keeps your interest every step of the way
","It's a long movie, about 2.5 hours but every step of the way there's some twist to keep your attention. And then it all comes together beautifully in the end when everything is explained.",10,0,1,23 January 2020
