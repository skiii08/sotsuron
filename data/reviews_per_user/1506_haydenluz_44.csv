","I saw where this movie was going in the first 15 minutes, but War Dogs still found a way to be an over the top good time, with enjoyable leads, and a fun soundtrack.",5,0,0,4 July 2020
Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me If You Can
","Catch Me If You Can, based on the true story of Frank William Abangale, directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, was one of the craziest, yet super enjoyable movies I've ever seen.Catch Me If You Can was a very intelligent movie. Jeff Nathanson wrote out this brilliantly, sly script, with great writing for these A-list actors. There were a couple of scenes that seemed really armored, and cheesy, but the majority of the scenes were very clever, and really entertaining. From the first act, all the way up until the very end of the third act, was very powerful and beguiling. Come the last 20 minutes or so, it seemed a little dragged out, and could've been summarized faster.This bunch of well respected actors put on phenomenal performances. Frank W. Abagnale Jr, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, had such a deep motive, due to his childhood troubles. Leo put on such a mature, and witty performance, that it made the audience care and worry for him. Frank W. Abangnale Sr, played by Christopher Walken, had a very important role in the film, just being a supportive character. Because to his troubles, it causes Jr to make the decisions he makes. Tom Hanks is the other star of the film, on the side of Di'Caprio. He did a fantastic job in his role, and created a unique bond between him and Leo.The score by, perhaps the GOAT, John Williams, had a deep, mysterious, suspenseful score, that complimented the each scene.Overall, this will go down as one of my favorite Di'Caprio & Hanks films.",9,0,0,20 March 2020
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Who Framed Roger Rabbit
","Who Framed Roger Rabbit, originated by Gary K. Wolf, directed by Robert Zemeckis, and produced by Walt Disney & Steven Spielberg, was every Looney Tunes & Disney fans dream! The story was loads of fun, but the characters are what really stole the show! Every character had their own appeal, and creative edge, that brought this movie to unbelievable heights. I could've watched all these BRILLIANTLY animated characters do aimless stuff for 3 hours, never mind watching a decently structured movie for an hour and fourty minutes.The screenplay by Jeffery Price, Peter S. Seaman & Gary K. Wolf was appealing to all ages. Though this movie was super silly, and over the top, it had somewhat of a structure due to the witty, yet humorous script.For a 1988 movie, this film was so colorful, and visually beautiful! The cinematography, animations, & effects won two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects & Best Film Editing. The art directors did a fantastic job of blending the animated characters, to the real people, with the addition of the silly props.Overall, if you love the Looney Tunes & Disney characters, this movie is right up your alley, and a must watch!",9,0,0,7 July 2020
Mulan," Mulan
","Mulan, directed by Tony Bancroft & Barry Cook, produced by Pam Coats, is one of Disney's first princess', that really wasn't a typical princess, doing princess duties. Bancroft & Cook incorporated great heart-warming messages throughout the story, treating the kids like actual human beings, and also giving the adults something to be invested in as well. This was a big 'girl power' movement, but I was perfectly okay with it, due to it's soulful messages. The story was pretty fast paced, but well balanced with the tones & amount of content they had to offer.Hand Bacher & Ric Sluiter did an amazing job bringing these fantastic drawing-animations to life, backed up with favorable voice overs by Eddie Murphy, BD Wong, and more! All of these characters looked great, and were balanced out very well; nobody shadowed one another. Mulan was an empowering character, that you really cared about because she embraces such an influential & powering figure. Her character development meant so much to the film, with the narrative flowing through her actions. Mushu is one of my favorite Disney characters of all time! He is the needed comedic relief of the film, having just enough screentime to not over saturate his character. The antagonist is pretty creepy, while posing a huge threat at all times. All of the additional side characters were great! They were all great fun, and utilized nicely, complimenting Mulan.The screenplay was very serious at times, but managed to sneak in well placed comedy, and deep dialogues. The dialogues were wise and witty, with a few silly moments to really even out the tone & pacing.The score by Jerry Goldsmith had a great battle score. Goldsmith had a hand from Stevie Wonder, Mathew Wilder & David Zippel, to help create these near-classic songs.Overall, this movie was very unique, and it truly paid off. Disney classic!",7,0,0,4 July 2020
Unbreakable," Eastrail177: Unbreakable
","Unbreakable, directed, produced & written by Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, aka M. Night, is one of the most underrated, unorthodox, super hero origin stories out today. Coming off his best movie (at that time) in The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan decided to embrace the up and coming comic book movie genre, by creating his own take on it. Shyamalan did a great job directing this piece, utilizing a lot of great one shot-long takes, while adding everything he thought was necessary. He told such a brilliantly focused story, peeling back the layers one at a time, backed up with tremendous detail, that got me invested into everything and everyone. I just watched this movie on Monday, but I watched it again today (Thursday) just because it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate it more and more, everytime you watch it!I'm particularly not the biggest Bruce Willis fan, but I thought he did a very good job here. For once, he's very subtle, but the confusion & pain aspect he brings in, makes his character so genuine, and easy to care about. His character development was just the icing on the cake, making it extremely easy to root for him, after discovering everything we need to know about him. Samuel L. Jackson in this subtle, reserved role, worked out just as well. You just care for the guy so much, and you whole heartily felt the pain he goes through. He wasn't always present in the film, but everything was facilitated through him. Robin Wright Penn was just okay. I really didn't care for her performance all that much, being nothing more than a plot device. Spenser Treat Clark was the real compliment to the family. Clark put on a very good performance at such a young age, displaying great emotions.The script was very powerful all in it's own. With the few long take scenes, that's when Shyamalan took the advantage of utilizing his witty dialogue, making it pop. Surprisingly, Shyamalan added a few solid laughs here and there, that kept the film from being too serious.James Newton Howard is a genius with the score. Throughout the whole film, and mainly the last act, he really drags you in, with this deep, somber & suspenseful score.Overall, this was my first M. Night Shyamalan film, and I was blown away by his style! I will be sure to review as much work of his as possible.",9,2,2,26 March 2020
Memento," Memento
","Christopher Nolan took his brother's short story Memento Mori, and turned it into a serious cinematic masterpiece! No disrespect to Nolan's first piece in The Following, but this is the film that truly jumpstarted his marvelous career. Nolan created this original & nifty narrative, with a creative structure that was so mysterious & witty; with every layer that got peeled back, it got more and more intriguing. Chris Nolan has this act of always keeping his movies entertaining, with great pacing. One of the best thing's he does is create such a mysterious story, that it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate the movie that much more. The film is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed throughout; a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse.I'm not the biggest fan of Guy Pearce to begin with, maybe because I never really gave him a fair chance, with watching his movies like, Iron Man 3 & Bedtime Stories, but he really changed my mind here. He puts on a fantastic performance! To back up his performance, was a beautiful script written by Chris Nolan himself. With such an intelligent, and memorable script, Nolan was up for an Academy Award in 2002 for Best Original Screenplay, but came up short to Julian Fellowes who wrote Gosford Park. There was not one boring piece of dialogue within the film, while having it's fair share of powerful quotes.Overall, I'm definitely going to have to rewatch this again to pick up some missing pieces, but this is an absolute, must watch!",10,1,1,15 April 2020
Zootopia," Zootopia
","Zootopia, directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore, and co-directed by Jared Bush was a charming childrens story, that targets a lot of sensitive subjects occurring today, like racism, drugs, etc. Zootopia deservingly raked in a billion dollars at the box office.
The story wasn't the most original, and quiet predictable, but the leads in Judy Hopps & Nick Wilde (Ginnifer Goodwin & Jason Bateman) kept it fresh and enjoyable. The screenplay by Jim Reardon, Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Phil Johnaton, Jennifer Lee, Jared Bush & Josie Trinidad was very witty, funny, and even dark. It was very well coordinated considering the large sum of writters and producers. Byron Howard, Rich Moore & Jared Bush put on a great showing of their creativity. The characters, and settings they created were so vibrant, and fun. The cinematography and animation by Nathan Warner was done very well. The animations were clear, and looked as realistic as possible. Zootopia won a Golden Globe & Academy Award for Best Animated Featured Film.
Overall, this is a cute, and charming tale. Everything was written with a lot of heart, and well thought out, and it shows.",8,0,0,14 March 2020

Knives Out," Knives Out
","Knives Out had Rian Johnson's hand all over it! He directed, produced, and wrote the film, just coming off of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, that was pretty controversial, but bounced back very well with a definitive mystery classic. Not only did he create one of the best mysterys to come to the big screen, but he was able to incorporate all of the enjoyable genres like crime, drama, thriller, & comedy. Johnson painted these beautiful frames, adding so much depth to his shots. With shooting in detail, rather than in film, it added a lot of depth to every scene, while utilizing the natural light that was provided.Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job modernizing the murder mystery/who did it tale, and really making it his own. The screenplay was coherent & fresh, being so witty, sharp & hilarious. He created this crystal clear narrative, backed up with so much wit, and style, it made you overlook all the simplicities. The few subplots this film had, it added amazing layers & depth, while it all intertwined with the big picture so well, enhancing this great mystery tale. The tone switch ups this film had was incredible! The tone switched up every half hour or so, keeping us on our toes, but explaining everything in depth, while keeping it as entertaining as possible.Mary Vernieu casted easily the best cast of 2019 so far. Knives Out was chock-full of A-list actors like Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis & more! Everyone knew their place, and played their roles the best they could've. Christopher Plummer put on such a mature & witty performance, arguably being one of the funniest of the group. Daniel Craig was one of my favorite castings for this movie. His performance was very witty, and clever, mixed with great tongue & cheek jokes. Craig may not have been the main protagonist we follow, but he is most certainly one of the best performers in this movie! Ana de Armas was our sweet 'innocent' main protagonist. We follow her for most of the film, and my god, does she put on a GREAT performance! Chris Evans has been more focused on playing a cool headed, heroic character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but here he puts on a devious, sarcastically funny, yet charming & persuasive character. We got a little taste of him in the first act, but not as much as the other supporting characters. Evans becomes more present in the second and third act, adding a different flare to this unique family. Rian Johnson created great tention with all of the characters, throwing in nifty twists, keeping everyone involved, and relevant.
The art directors & production designers in David Crank & David Celestenger created this beautiful, old time mansion. The way Rian Johnson executed the mansion was fantastic, making everything feel free, yet claustrophobic, while rising the stakes.Overall, I can easily say this is my favorite mystery movie, even over Sherlock Holmes; Highly recommended.",9,0,1,26 June 2020
Superbad," Superbad
","Let me start off by saying, this movie is NOT for everyone. If you like Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, or Bill Hader, you're watching the right movie. The plot is SUPER over the top! The concept is very teen related, so it comes off appealing to the older teenage crowd. On the down side, there really is no arch to the movie; they more or less just made a few bumps in the road, and just went with the flow. Most of the scenes are over the top, and can also be on the cringier side, but it's what the movie embraces.Overall, if you enjoyed movies like Pineapple Express, 21 Jump Street, etc, you're going to enjoy this movie a lot.",6,0,0,4 July 2020

Tangled," Tangled
","Even though Tangled could be quite predictable, Byron Howard & Nathan Greno added enough heart and creativity to this fast paced film to make it an enjoyable time. There were plenty of laughs within this intelligent script, backed up by above average characters, fun voice overs, and decently catchy songs. I cannot stress this enough, the animations of this film was absolutely stunning, nailing two of the hardest things to do in animation, in people and hair!Overall, this film was better than I thought; definitely something to check out for those Disney fans out there !",7,0,0,28 June 2020

","Lilo & Stitch, directed and written by, Chris Sanders & Dean DeBlois is an ageless film in it's own way. The fast paced story was cute and sentimental, but also rough around the edges, backed up with fun and creative characters. The script was consistently funny, with true feelings the characters bring to the screen. The animations were really great, putting on a beautiful display of drawing animation; The characters looked like they were taken right off a piece of paper, and put into live action! Overall, this is a great nostalgic movie to look back on.",7,0,0,4 July 2020
The Revenant," The Revenant
","The Academy Award winning Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu took Michael Punke's novel, and really turned it into something of his own. AGI captured countless breathtaking shots, utilizing a lot of long-wide takes, and some hand held shots. The premise is a little played out, but he did a BRILLIANT job putting a creative and unique twist to nature, and human nature. With AGI incorporating this tremendous act of risk at all times, it really helped to keep the audience engaged, and to not pay too much attention to the longer runtime. The opening scene made for such a crazy first act. With such a hard hitting opening, you have to keep that same energy throughout each act, but AGI slowed down the pace a little bit come the second act, incorporating some emotional notes, while being a little repetitive with his direction. The third act capitalized on the speed change prior, and became a very entertaining, high octane final act.With Leonardo DiCaprio & Tom Hardy leading the charge, you know you're automatically in for a treat. After all of Leo's Academy Award performances, HE FINALLY RECEIVED HIS FIRST OSCAR, being so well deserved. His emotions felt so genuine, that you can truly feel his pain, and really connect with his character. Tom Hardy also put on such a fantastic performance, also being nominated for an Oscar. His character had a very clear notion, and was a very big part of the way things unfold. The acting overall was very good, without anyone overshadowing one another. The tattered & dirty costume design by Jacqueline West was so articulate and well designed. The makeup & hairstyles was just the cherry on top to complete that rugid look.The Academy Award Winning Emmanuel Lubezki took over the photography, and my god, was it beautiful. He utilized the beautiful natural lighting, while also incorporating a lot of dark colors to embrace the gritty & cruel tone. Not only was the cinematography gorgeous, but the visual & practical effects absolutely stole the show.... and most of the budget. The visual effects added this level of grit to the film, making everything feel so real, from the action to the climate. AGI and the effects team did an amazing job making you feel like you were in the movie. I was cold when there was a bitter cold scene, I felt the pain with all the injuries; AGI really knows how to connect to the audience.Overall, the 3 awards & 12 nominations speak for themselves. This is an absolute must-see, especially for the DiCaprio & Hardy fans out there.8.5/10",9,0,0,14 April 2020
Split," Split
","M. Night Shyamalan IS BACK! After a sixteen & a half year lay-off from the Eastrail177 series, we FINALLY get the stand alone sequel! Being away for so long, Shyamalan was able to appreciate other film making styles & makers, that he meticulously picked his crew to create Split. Shyamalan hand-selected Mark Gioulakis, after seeing the beautiful cinematography in It Follows, Mara LePere-Schloop, after seeing the creative & authentic production design in Django Unchained, West Dylan Thordson after his best composition in Joy, and also came up on a diamond in the rough find, in James McAvoy. Shyamalan has this articulate sense of direction & story telling; Split is a movie you need to be patient with, and able to embrace from the start, because if you don't, you're probably not going to have the best time. With a few filler scenes, the pacing can be a bit choppy at times, but fulfilles this high octane tone, being very suspenseful, and satisfyingly unsettling.My god, James McAvoy shines bright here! In order to put on such amazing performances (if you will), McAvoy really got into his role off the camera, as well as on. I personally believe that he got completely robbed of at least an Oscar nomination, regardless of when the movie was released. He did a great job sharing the wealth with Anya Taylor-Joy, who also put on a great performance. Anya Taylor-Joy just shot the movie The Witch last year, and carried her talent onto Split. Taylor-Joy is such a FANTASTIC young actress, that sells her emotions as authentic as possible. Her character development started right from the beginning, and didn't stop, due to all of the layers her character has. Betty Buckley put on a decent performance, being a nice, optimistic inspiration to McAvoy. The other two actresses in Haley Lu Richardson & Jessica Sula were nothing but plot devices. Their emotions were just okay, while having easily the worst dialogues out of all the characters.The script by M. Night Shyamalan had a lot of intriguing dialogue, that sat in such an uneasy way at times. He really takes his time to tell the story he wants to tell, fleshing out each character & plot point as much as possible. M. Night kept up with his little humor flare, adding in just enough laughs.Mike Gioulakis utilized a lot of dull colors, and dark lighting to create this suspenseful, and creepy tone throughout each scene. This dark, claustrophobic, basement set Mara LePere-Schloop created, leaves you at the edge of your seat at all times.Overall, Split was a success! I didn't quiet enjoy it more than Unbreakable, due to some inconsistencies, and structure issues, but nonetheless, still a solid film, and a great addition to the trilogy.",7,0,0,4 July 2020
American Psycho," American Psycho
","Mary Harron's depiction of Bret Easton Ellis novel, American Psycho, is a true, original MASTERPIECE! The most beautiful part about this movie, was the ambiguous approach Mary Harron took. Her direction and story telling had a dark comedic tone, with so many open ended outcomes, having great detailed narration from Christian Bale. She also utilized a lot of foreshadowing, allowing things to really brew up into a fantastic story. Mary Harron used a lot of focused, close up shots, to really display the raw emotions in each character.Christian Bale is an actor, man. I personally connected with a side of his character, because of my OCD nature, quick, sly remarks, and my blunt tone (just not to his extreme). His character is a real narcissist jerk, that is super high octane. Christian Bale did a phenomenal job getting into this role, working out, and really filling the role as an inside psychopath. He paid close attention to detail, really displaying, and explaining the true characteristics of a psychopath. The fact that Bale didn't get nominated for his performance, is a little absurd, considering this is one of his BEST performances. This was mainly a character study of Patrick Bateman, but we also had a lot of great performances across the board, for the supporting cast in Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Samantha Mathis and more.The screenplay by Mary Harron & Guinevere Turner was terrific! They really focused on making this a dark comedy movie, along with the drama/thriller/horror aspect. All of the dialogues had so much intelligent word play, having countless uncensored vulgar conversations, with many righteous remarks. Though there are some scenes that are genuinely horrific, Harron & Turner didn't shy away from incorporating consistent dark humor laughs, that came from the soul.The action was brilliantly utilized, not overdoing it, being very graphic and unsettling. The way Mary Harron ties all the action in, in the final act, left my jaw on the floor, and made me rethink everything!",10,4,5,11 April 2020
Silver Linings Playbook," Silver Linings Playbook
","I really connected well with this film due to the OCD aspect of it, also due to the tremendous amount of heart this film was made with. It had such a great script, with some really solid acting across the board. On the down side, not to say that the film was simple, because it was far from that, but I'd go as far as saying that it was a little predictable; I saw where it was going in the first twenty minutes of the film. Even though this movie had a steady tone, it overstayed it's welcome by about fifteen-twenty minutes. There was just a little too much filler to extend the runtime to hit that two hour mark.",7,0,0,30 June 2020
The Fault in Our Stars," The Fault in Our Stars
","The Fault in our Stars, originally written by John Green, was directed by Josh Boone, who has no credentials, and is basically a no name. With that being said, he made a very appealing film, that thankfully missed the cliché moments. This story is very meaningful, backed up with a witty and powerful script, that tugs on the heart strings more than a few times. The story partially narrated by Shailene Woodley added this deep feeling, that helped engage the audience.The lead characters in Shailene Woodley & Ansel Elgort (a fellow New York Knick fan) had this great, emotional chemistry, that sold me from the first scene they met. Their character development individually, and together was one of the best I've seen in a romantic movie. Both of their acting was oscar nomination worthy. All of the supportive characters were nothing but plot devices, but everyone was pretty good; We didn't just get some annoying friends or side characters, like usual.Overall, this movie may have not been as good as the book, but Boone did a damn good job putting it on the big screen.",8,0,0,7 July 2020
Cars 2," Cars 2
","Cars 2, was directed & written by John Lasseter, again, but co-directed by Brad Lewis this time. He's produced titles like Ratatouille, and has been a voice over in The Incredibles & Ratatouille. It was a highly anticipated film, but it clearly fell flat, and missed the mark completely. John Lasseter gave us a messy, unwanted, unoriginal spy sequel. First things first, they should've scrapped EVERYTHING about the spy scheme, and expanded on building Radiators Springs. I was personally excited to see them expand on Radiator Springs, but they decided to go cliché once again, and do a stupid world tour. With the reputation that Pixar has of building worlds, this one was just okay, but could've been so much better, and focused. This may be far fetched, but I got this weird taste of Rocky 3 & 4 in this movie.Owen Wilson returns as Lightning McQueen, but as an underlining character; he just didn't have much to do. McQueen seemed to have matured off screen, but in the first set, it seemed like the same arrogant McQueen, mixed with the nice guy attitude as well. After the heavy foreshadowing first act, the movie basically became super predictable and all about Mater. Larry the Cable Guy hasn't lost a step, as far as his comedy and stature goes. If you like his character, you'll most likely enjoy this film. If you are one of those people who had a negative opinion on Mater, you're most likely going to strongly dislike this movie. As much as I love Michael Caine, Finn McMissile, and everyone else affiliated with the spy scheme, should've been abolished. I didn't care for any of their characters whatsoever. Professor Z is just a cliché bond villain, that the writers try making important, but he just sucked.The screenplay by John Lasseter, Dan Fogelman & Ben Queen had their fair share of comedy, but it wasn't as cohesive as the first, and seemed a little forced at time, including the world cultural jokes.We got more action this time around, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was better. The racing, courses, and foreign car designs were very cool, but all of that kind of took a back seat to the stupid spy theme they were going for. The cinematography by Jeremy Lasky, again & Sharon Calahan was visually beautiful, with so many colors, with amazing animations, that stood out more than the first movie. The art directors created this beautiful European atmosphere, with realistic looking back drops, that I personally don't really care for in an animated film.Overall, I hate to say this because I really enjoyed the original Cars but, Cars 2 my least favorite Pixar movie.",2,0,0,2 July 2020
Back to the Future Part III," Back to the Future Part III
","Robert Zemeckis, Steven Spielberg & Bob Gale come together one last time to create the final film of the Back to the Future trilogy.Other than Doctor Emmett Brown's character development, and it having some relevance to the previous movies, it's pretty fair to say Back to the Future: Part 3, was a cash grab. The concept is pretty strung on, with a story pulled out of left field, to keep the series going for one more round. Part 3 was supposed to be apart of Part 2, but they figured with the duration, and content, they had two movies on their hands. Maybe because I'm not the biggest western guy, but other than Part 3 being the funniest of the bunch, it didn't pack the punch the other films did. The story may come off a little light, but Part 3 finds it's footing, coming off a jumbled Part 2. Zemeckis, Spielberg & Gale didn't add as much time traveling, keeping the narrative focused, like the first.Michael J. Fox continues his bold, yet charming role,but he didn't have much character development, due to the fact that he didn't have much to do in this film. One particular thing I loved about his character this time around, was the fact he called himself Clint Eastwood. The greatest thing about this film, was the chemistry Fox & Llyod built over this short, five year span. Mary Steenburgen was a rare pleasure of someone who plays a sudden love for a main character. Clara was a great compliment to Doctor Brown, helping expand his character. Thomas F. Wilson returns once again, to be our antagonist, but his role is pretty outplayed already.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale, had the same charm, and familiar lines from the movies prior. With the western spin on it, it helped make this film the funniest out of the trilogy.The production design by Rick Carter, who also did the design for Back to the Future: Part 2, looked great, while really capturing that western feel. Part 3 was less reliant on the effects, other than the time travel scenes, really. The costume design by Joanna Johnston & Chuck Velasco had that great western feel, but the costumes stood too clean, for a dirty, dusty film.Overall, this looks to be the last if the series. I SINCERELY HOPE NOBODY MAKES A FOURTH, OR A REBOOT! LEAVE THEM ALONE!",6,0,0,7 July 2020
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, originated by F. Scott Fitzgerald, directed by David Fincher, wasn't one of his best films, but it still had a few complex messages. With Fincher being out of his element, shooting his first PG-13 movie, he still managed put together a great film with a lot of heart. While Fincher is behind the camera, you can always expect a dazzling looking film. He created these beautiful, authentic shots, really capturing the feel of the early 1900s, to the mid 1900s. For his work, he was nominated at the Academy Awards, but coming up short to Danny Boyle in Slumdog Millionaire.David Fincher created this original premise, with great story telling, and a focused narrative. The way they embraced the meaning of life & death, felt borrowed from Forrest Gump, but they still managed to create their own vision, with tremendous meaning and value. With so much going on, the story ran into some pacing issues, being fast paced at first, and then stalling out a little come the second act.The character performances as a whole was very good, but nobody really stands out all that well; A lot of the characters just felt like plot devices, to keep the narrative going. The only character I cared about was Brad Pitt. He put on such a phenomenal performance as Benjamin Button, being nominated for an Academy Award.The screenplay by Eric Roth & Robin Swicord was very powerful. They packed a lot of true emotions, being rich & authentic to the premise and time frame. They were also nominated for an Oscar was well, but falling short to Slumdog Millionaire, again.The cinematography by the Academy Award nominee Claudio Miranda, had such a clear, yet gloomy tone. The color palette he utilized consisted a lot of greys, blues, & yellows. The visual effects was the clear cut star of the film. The huge visual effects team utilized countless deaging & aging methods, essentially being seamless. The makeup & hairstyle team also displayed BEAUTIFUL work, to the point where I didn't know if it was CGI or makeup, that's how flawless their attention to detail was. With a stunning production design, and crystal clear picture, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button deserved the Oscar for Best Picture.Overall, this may not have been my favorite David Fincher Film, but with the thirteen Academy Award nominations, Fincher has done it again.",7,0,0,1 May 2020
8 Mile," 8 Mile
","8 Mile, directed and produced by Curtis Hudson, portrays Marshall 'Eminem' Mathers' life beautifully, incorporating the hard racial profiling, Em's real life events, while also adding in some believable fabricated scenes. Hudson doesn't come from the same background as Eminem, so you can tell that Hudson & Eminem had a great, trustworthy bond, creating this movie together.Mali Finn didn't cast quiet the all-star cast people would come see, but there was just enough raw emotion & charisma in all of the characters, to really build a great film, driven by the characters.The screenplay by Scott Silver, was very raw, and ghetto natured. The emotional scenes seemed too scripted; Eminem's raps saved the script from being just okay.The music and score all produced by Eminem, winning an Academy Award for Loose Yourself, was well thought out, beyond clever, and memorable. I personally tried to root for the antagonist rhymes, but they were all just inferior.The cinematography by the up and coming Rodrigo Prieto was beautifully lit, with these dreary and dark scenes, to set this dull tone. The art directors in Phillip Messina, Kevin Kavanaugh & Harry E. Otto, shot this in the best location possible, Detroit. All of the scenery was genuine to the feel and look of Detroit.Overall, Curtis Hudson did a very good job adapting his style to be able to put out such a genuine movie, with the great assistance from Eminem.",7,0,0,7 July 2020

With all the hype behind it, Joker has become one of the most profitable 'superhero' movies of all time, earning over a billion dollars globally, at the box office.Even though the story could've dragged out a tad, it was paced out well, having this real unsettling tone throughout, giving us a great origin story on Arthur Fleck. We get introduced to Arthur Fleck's grueling hardships he endures, while having this insane psychological-driven story. The climax is just the cherry on top, re engaging the audience with a phenomenal twist. The ending set may come off a tad rushed, but I thought it was jaw dropping! It caps off Fleck's origin, and 'starts' the devious tear Fleck goes on.Joaquin Phoenix is an absolute stud! With such a star studded line up at the Academy Awards, Joaquin Phoenix shined the brightest, taking home the Oscar! He absolutely nails every single character trait the Joker has, getting right down to the very finest of details. All of the events that built Arthur Fleck up to becoming what he is, had such deep meaning, making you connect with his character easily. I was honestly so happy to see De Niro in this movie! This may have not been one of his biggest roles, but he carried himself through this supporting role like the professional he is, meaning a lot to the big picture, despite his lack of screen time.The screenplay by Todd Phillips & Scott Silver spoke to many degrees of sophistication. They incorporated such deep & twisted dialogue, that really helped dig into Arthur's feelings, while also touching up on true things in peoples lives. Phillips & Silver we're nominated by the Osacrs for Best Adapted Screenplay, but fell short to the very worthy, Parasite.The cinematography was brilliant! They utilized a lot of hand held scenes, with a fair amount of close ups. They used a lot of dark colors to really enhance the glum tone, representing Arthur Fleck. Joker wasn't very effects heavy, as you can probably tell by the budget, but the few times it is there for backdrops, it was presented very cleanly.This movie is a must watch for all the DC fans out there. It was a well told story on who the Joker really is, and makes you appreciate who he was in the past shows/movies you've seen him in.",8,0,0,12 April 2020
The Wolf of Wall Street," Top 5 Favorite Movies
","The Wolf of Wall Street, was directed & produced by my favorite director in Martin Scorsese, who's directed popular titles like Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Departed, Shutter Island, and more! Scorsese did it again! By taking authentic source material, while slightly deviating it from the truth, for enjoyable film making purposes, he created this masterpiece, inspired by Jordan Belfort's real story, and his autobiographies. With Scorsese having a background with Leonardo DiCaprio, and having an excellent reputation directing crime/drama's, this movie was assuring to be great. Terrance Winter & Martin Scorsese did a phenomenal job telling this narrative. The screenplay by Terrance Winter was super creative & conniving, and I feel it didn't get enough credit. The script was so vulgar, yet very witty, while still being ridiculously funny. The story has so many memorable scenes, well known across the world. The US alone did over 110 million dollars at the box office, and the other 160+ million coming from other regions (392 million in total). Not only was this the best paced out, 3 hour film I've seen, but probably one of the greatest paced movies I've seen, in general. I was so intrigued from minute one, all the way to minute 180, I even sat through the whole ending credits. Maybe because I have a high interest in money, but the first act was one of the greatest openings acts I've seen, that actually holds up, and is not just an attention grabber. Even though Martin Scorsese & Terrace Winter flipped some of the names, and some being made up, due to secrecy reasons, this A-list cast had such inspiring charisma, and displayed all the real actions, tremendously. After watching countless videos on the true story, and what the real Jordan Belfort (who was also on set for the production) thought; all of these seemed to be fantasy's, were almost all true, and pretty accurate. According to Belfort, Scorsese & Winter dumbed things down. I have seen A LOT of movies, and a few Dicaprio movies, but this was, hands down the best acting I've seen across a cast, but giving tremendous credit to Leonardo DiCaprio, who got snubbed for an Oscar for his performance. His anti-hero swagger, with such an engrossing personality, brought an abundance of charm, wit, and tons of comedy, to this movie. Dan Porush, named Donnie Azoff in the movie, played by Jonah Hill, is Jordan's second in command. Jonah Hill put on a FANTASTIC performance; definitely my favorite performance of his. I also thought Jonah Hill was snubbed for an Oscar, by Jared Leto of all people. Jonah Hill embodied Dan Porush to a T, down to his wife, his ambitions attitude, and everything else. Only narrative nitpick I have; the way Donnie & Jordan meet in the movie, and their outcome was tweaked. Jordan's love life was also nailed to a T, other than the name changes. Cristin Milioti did a great job for her small part in this 3 hour movie, but THE ABSOLUTE, DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, TALENTED, Margot Robbie was the main squeeze to Jordan. Her character development in the third act compliments the tone it was going for. The way Scorsese displays their relationship was pretty accurate, almost all the way down the line. As far as the strattonites go, in Alton 'The Otter' Cufflberg (Henry Zebrowski), Cherter Ming (Kenneth Choi), Robbie 'Pinehead' Fineburg (Brian Sacca), Brad Bodnick (Jon Bernthal) & Nicky 'Rugrat' Koskoff (P.J Byne), they had the most chaotic roles out of everyone, on the side of Leo. Every character knew their role, and played it to perfection. I loved Rob Reiner in this film, even though he wasn't that important. His crazy dad attitude was displayed more than clear, and was a great addition. Matthew McConaughey had another small, but important role in Jordan Belfort's come up. After doing further research, McConaughey had a lot more of an impact than his screen time allowed. One of my lowkey favorite additions to this movie, was Bo Dietl, playing Belfort's PI. Bo Dietl was the actual PI of the real Jordan Belfort. His character was just another small, but necessary addition, with such an effortless performance, due to Dietl playing himself. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto, was shot beautifully, with a lot of great takes, but the visual effects were hit and miss. I appreciate the tone they were trying to set, placing the effects nicely, and not overusing them, but I don't know if it had to do with the large sum of people on the crew, or what, but the visual effects weren't the greatest, and had room for improvement. The editing by probably one of the most credible editors in the game, in Thelma Shoonmaker, who edited Casino, Shutter Island, Goodfellas & The Departed, had a tough task at hand. This movie was 3 hours long, so I can only imagine how many deleted scenes there were, and what the run-time would've actually been, without so many cuts, and mashes. Shoonmaker did make some scenes a little obvious that they were two scenes mashed together, or shot at different times, but it's hard to fault someone with that much on their plate, with that much of a hefty resumé. In conclusion, as you can tell, I had a lot to say about this movie, but that's only because it's one of my favorite movies of all time. I really wish I could give it the 10, but because of some tweaked scenes, and some choppy edits, I have it as a solid 9. Anything less than a 7, is absolutely disrespectful.",10,0,0,13 March 2020
Hancock," Hancock
","Hancock, directed by Peter Berg, was his own, original take on a superhero film. If we're being honest, it didn't pack much weight at all. Will Smith is the reason why this movie didn't completely flop.From the start, I caught the notion that everyone behind the camera just didn't really care all that much; They basically let Will Smith, be Will Smith, and just carry the movie with his stature. The narrative on it's own was a big issue. It had such a choppy flow, being super fast paced, with little - to - no setup. The script by Vincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan was pretty funny, but lacked wit, and powerful dialogue scenes. If this movie was more of Will Smith cracking tongue and cheek jokes, and fighting bad guys, it probably would've been better. Jason Bateman & Charlize Theron did their best to compliment Smith, but the character developments they tried to display during the second act, wasn't all that good, or necessary. Theron was just a plot device until the third act, with her character becoming short lived. I was fond of Jae Head's performance, for what little meaning he had. For his first motion picture, he does very well, and seems to be a favorable young actor on the rise.The effects and action sequences were done pretty amateurishly, feeling too cartoonish, and sloppy.",5,0,0,7 July 2020
Finding Dory," Finding Dory
","Andrew Stanton, John Lasseter, Bob Peterson, Jeremy Lasky & Thomas Newton came back together after thirteen years to make Finding Nemo's 'sequel', Finding Dory. The first set was great! Stanton did all the right things to drag us in, and want more. As for the rest of the story, it was slower paced because there was much more going on this time around. On the downside, I felt as if Stanton got a little lazy, and borrowed some content from the first film, so a few scenes just felt unbalanced. The major downfall I had with this movie, I can't have Dory as my main protagonist!!! She serves much better as a side character; her character is a close comparison to Mater, just not as annoying. It did the same thing Cars 2 did, and they both flopped.I can truly appreciate the effort the team put in, into creating new and original characters, but some of them were hit and miss. The screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Bob Peterson & new comer Victoria Strouse, didn't have as much charisma throughout, as the first one did, having pretty bad jokes throughout, and just lacked heart that the first movie spewed of.The cinematography by Jeremy Lasky & Ian Megibben was even better than the first one. The lights and darks, the animations, the texture in everything to the fish, to the water, to the sunlight was just spectacular.I usually stay away from mentioning the endings, unless they really mean something, but this ending made this movie plummet real fast. It was just too over the top, and tried to flesh out too much, because they realize they overstuffed the narrative to begin with.Overall, this movie may not have been as fresh as the first, and took FOREVER to release, but it wasn't as bad as some of the other trash we got a few years ago.",5,0,0,2 July 2020
The Shawshank Redemption," The Shawshank Redemption
","The Shawshank Redemption, directed & written by Frank Darabont, is a definitive top 25 movie of all time. With the chemistry Darabont has with Niki Marvin & Stephen King, he decided to take a homerun-swing on Rita Hayworth & Stephen King's book. Niki Marvin may only have two below average movies coming into this movie, but she constructed this beautifully crafted picture, being nominated by the Oscars for Best Picture, just coming up short to Forrest Gump. In 1994, The Shawshank Redemption had a budget of 25 million dollars, and took home 58 million. After today's inflation rate, the budget was 34.8 million dollars, and took home a healthy 101.4 million dollars, a profit of approximately 66.6 million dollars!I have seen hundreds of movies in my time, and I'd arguably say that Frank Darabont had one of the best senses of direction; everything just flowed perfectly together, creating this fantastic crime/drama. The story was a brilliantly told, fresh & original take on a jail bird story, being flawlessly paced out, keeping everyone engaged at all times! The overall message of hope & optimism, spoke to so many different levels, giving this movie great layers of depth. The only nitpicks I had with the story, some set ups, and scenes were a little clichÃ©, but tremendously easy to overlook.Deborah Aquila did a great job casting this talented bunch of actors. You can tell all of the characters were invested so much into their characters, to the point where it felt like they were actual prisoners. This was my personal favorite performance by Morgan Freeman. His character is intuitive & so full of knowledge, being a positive figure the prisoners look up to. His character development was the best out of all of the characters, connecting us to his character more & more as the acts go on. Out of all these great performances, Morgan Freeman was the only one to receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, coming up short to none other than, Tom Hanks, in Forrest Gump. Tim Robbins was a diamond in the rough casting. Sure, he's had a few good performances, but nothing before nor after holds up to his performance here. Morgan Freeman & Tim Robbins' characters are basically cut out of the same cloth. Robbins put on such a star studded performance, being so optimistic & witty. His character development is so pure, it's nothing short of genius, making it so easy to get behind his character, and root for him. In my opinion, Tim Robbins deserved that Oscar nomination just as much as Morgan Freeman. Seeing Bob Gunton in this movie, being more than a plot device like his previous titles, was pretty exciting. He showed off his talent when the lights were the brightest, putting on a great performance. James Whitmore stood out the most, out of the side characters. His character may not have meant the most initially, but his character development becomes a big part in the overall message. The characters as a whole were very enjoyable, although having a few characters with predictable personalities.The screenplay by Frank Darabont was outstanding! There was so many dialogues that spoke to high levels, being super clever, sliding in a few laughs, here and there. The screenplay was also noticed at the Oscars, coming up short to Jane Campion, who wrote The Piano.The cinematography by Roger Deakins was ALSO nominated at the Oscars, coming up short to the honorable Janusz Kaminski, who shot for Schindler's List. The cinematography had a great, authentic environment, with some great dramatic shots. The production designer in Terence Marsh had the great idea of shooting at the grimy Ohio State Reformatory, to add real prison-like settings and set pieces.The score by Thomas Newman (who went on to be one of the most accomplished composers), was an absolute masterpiece on it's own. Newman originalized this style of dramatic & haunting score, adding great tention to each scene. Thomas Newman was also up for an Oscar, but he came up short to my favorite composer of all time, John Williams, who composed Schindler's List.Overall, this movie did everything almost flawlessly. All of the Oscar nominations speak for themselves, being nominated in almost every single category.",10,0,0,13 March 2020

Marriage Story," Marriage Story
","Marriage Story, directed & written by Noah Baumbach was a beautiful representation of the effects of a divorce. We got our time with Scarlett Johansson, to see her side, and then we got our time with Adam Driver, viewing his side. I liked the fact that there wasn't a clear-cut good guy, and a clear-cut bad guy; you can see and understand both of their sides.The screenplay was so deep, and very relatable to the people who have been through such actions. Baumbach created a great emotional connection with the audience, backed up by award winning worthy preformances by both leads, in Driver & Johansson. They're character development, and emotion they both showed throughout, drove this film to new heights.Overall, Baumbach does it again! Highly recommend!",10,6,9,17 March 2020

","Shrek, originated by William Steig, directed by Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson, is my personal favorite DreamWorks film! The story was fast paced, but very interesting to say the least. It felt like a big spoof of the most well-known fairytales, and I enjoyed every damn minute of it.The characters and voice overs was the cream of the crop! Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are comedy gold together! Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson created a breath of fresh air, with all the little twists of the known characters.The screenplay by Ted Elliot, Terry Rossio, Joe Stillman & Roger S.H Schulman was big fun for the whole family.One of the most lowkey achievements this movie had was the music and score by Henry Gregson-Williams & John Powell. So entertaining, being loads of fun with catchy songs.",9,0,0,7 July 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," The Silence of the Lambs
","The Silence of the Lambs, originally by Thomas Harris, was directed by Johnathan Demme, and my god did he do a great friggin job. SOTL made 272.7 million dollars at the box office, well deservingly. Johnathan Demme, Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, & Ted Tally all won Oscars for their part in the film.
This take on Thomas Harris' story was done brilliantly! It takes you on this psychological rollercoaster, and just plays ping-pong with your brain. The team behind the camera did a great job pacing the film out.
Anthony Hopkins trademarked his role as Hannibal Lecter. The emotion and seriousness he brings to the table was well worthy of the Osacr he received. Believe it or not, Hopkins only had SIXTEEN MINUTES of screen time. I need more Hopkins!! Jodie Foster did a phenomenal job in her leading role. Demme did a great job by making her character vulnerable, in a way; A rookie on an on going case. Ted Lavine as Bill Buffalo did very good as well, but got somewhat shadowed by the two leading preformances. Bill Buffalo is all types of twisted, and was a great compliment to the leads.
The screenplay by Ted Tally was so deep, and witty. It set this dark, and creepy feel throughout the entire movie, in the best way possible.
The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto was shot so beautifully. The close up shots were very dramatic, in a good way, that added so much depth to the feeling of the film. Some shots were so fast, but it captured everything you needed to know; it was done very well.
Overall, this movie should go down as one of the greatest of all time. Very well shot, preformed, and everything around it.",10,0,0,13 March 2020
Monsters University," Monsters University
","Monsters University was directed & written by Dan Scanlon, produced by Kori Rae, Andrew Stanton, & John Lasseter who had their hands all over most of the Pixar classics! Pixar has had a little run with okay movies between 2011 & 2013, like Brave & Cars 2, but Mosters University was superior to both. After waiting eleven and a half years for the sequel, we finally got it, but as a surprising prequel. During the first two acts, it was fine, due to the okay pace & premise, but come the last act, and more or less the extended half hour, it was the best part of the movie! If the director and writers kept that pace the whole movie, and maybe condensed it a little bit, this movie would've been a great prequel.The characters had a great look, with charming voice overs, bringing back Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sulley & Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs. Dan Scanlon, Daniel Gerson & Robert L. Baird added a creative touch, capturing the college student traits and actions, in a PG form. Sadly, they're developments and cliché roles killed it.The screenplay by Dan Scanlot, Daniel Gerson & Robert L. Baird had some decent emotional scenes, but cluttered with hit or miss jokes, with unnecessary one liners from the original, just to say that they brought something back.Needless to say, the cinematography and animations were brilliant! Jean-Claude Kalache, and Matt Aspbury, had great detail with every strain of hair, blade of grass, and more!Overall, this wasn't one of those prequels that was unbearable to watch, but I wouldn't go as far as watching again for fun. I'd still love to see a sequel off of the original, 2001 Monsters Inc.",5,0,0,3 July 2020
Speed," Speed
","Speed, directed by Jan de Bont, produced by Mark Gordon, Allison Lyon & Ian Bryce was a high intensity, but typical action movie. In this rare occasion, the editing by John Wright, and score by Mark Mancina was what carried this movie, and made it more enjoyable.I'm usually okay with simple action movies, that doesn't have too much of a back story, but this one was just okay at best. With a cast of Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Daniels & Dennis Hopper, I was expecting some good character development, but we got stuck with a dry script, and poorly written characters by Graham Yost. Speed started off okay, but they put themselves in a hole, where there was only so much you can do with the scenes they created. Towards the end of the second set, it started to get pretty stale. My biggest flaw, that effected almost every aspect of the film, was that things were set up too conveniently for the leads; Not to say that there wasn't anything on the line, but it seemed like all the stuff that got thrown into the mix, seemed like they always found an easy way around it.Overall, this movie is a touch overrated, in my opinion. It was decent fun, while benefiting from being rated R, with notable leads, but it just didn't pack a lot of weight and emotion.",6,0,0,7 July 2020
The Purge," The Purge
","The Purge had James DeMonaco's hand all over it. He originated the story, wrote the film, and directed it, with some help from Michael Bay, Jason Blum, Bradley Fuller, Andrew Form & Sebastian Lemercier. With Michael Bay's name being behind this film, I was expecting big action, and it was just mediocre at best. DeMonaco had some gory kills, with some poor jump scares, but it all seemed very clichÃ© as a whole.The story was a simple thriller/horror, that wasn't the most original, while being pretty fast paced, and lazily structured. I do appreciate the twist DeMonaco put on it, but it didn't really help the film at all.The screenplay by James DeMonaco was pretty boring, and cringey, although the two leads in Ethan Hawke & Lena Headey weren't too bad; their kids on the other hand, were so disposable and strictly used for plot content, that is 100% avoidable, and predictable. As for the purgers, they came off super creepy, with those macabre masks, but when it came down to business, they were truly nothing special.Overall, this is one of those flicks that get worse and worse every time you see it. It's just okay the first time around, but any time after that, it starts to become more and more redundant. If you enjoy cheesy horror/thrillers, you'll probably enjoy this movie more than me. If you're like me, and know they're hit or miss for the most part, it's probably going to be hard to look past.",3,0,0,7 July 2020

He has his own incredible stylish direction, with beautiful framing work to really set the tones throughout this unpredictable narrative. Just by this piece of art Spike created, you can not only feel his pain, but also the pain from the injustice to people and returning war veterans. Spike did a really good job clearly stating his beliefs, without jamming down his one sided opinions, making it more political than it needed to be.When your actors really bond with the director, you are destined to get art like this every single time! You can tell there was absolutely no drama or anything behind the scenes, all great ideas being bounced off one another. Between Kim Coleman's casting & Spike Lee's intelligent & powerful script, these characters all stepped up to the plate, and hit a homerun! Every single character put their heart and soul into their roles, you can just feel the passion in their voices! Spike Lee crafted these beautiful emotional scenes, that just sucked you in closer to all of the characters. The chemistry between the main characters is nothing short of seamless! It feels like they were actual war buddies, with their rugid bonds, yet meaningful actions towards eachother.",9,6,15,15 June 2020
Click," Click
","I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan, no matter his role, but this movie was not one of my favorites, strictly because of the unoriginal premise, borrowed from Back to the Future & It's a Wonderful Life. Unlike those notable titles, Click DRAGGED, from the first set, all the way up until the end of the second act. The second act picks up a little bit in pace, but it's over cluttered with hit and miss jokes, with terrible acting by the usual Sandler supportive cast. The need for someone like Christopher Walken was highly unnecessary, and somewhat insulting to someone of his stature. The third act for me, was the most enjoyable, and impactful of the whole film. It was still a little dragged out, but it packed a lot more emotion, and heart, rather than the aimless jokes, and stupidity, like the first two acts had. The acting somehow got a few steps better, to where I'd be lying if I said I didn't shed a tear.Overall, this movie lacked a personality.

Stahelski leaned away from the emotional side, and packed this sequel with even more eye catching, gritty, high intensity action scenes. Some of the action scenes did seem a tad recycled, but it was still done exceptionally well by Keanu Reeves, and the amazing stunt team.Overall, this movie may not have been quite the breath of fresh air that the first movie was, but it was still a very good sequel, setting up for a great third film.",7,0,0,7 July 2020

Back to the Future," Back to the Future
","Back to the Future, directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, and produced by the great Steven Spielberg & Bob Gale, was inventive, and I quote, 'heavy'.Back to the Future may not have been the first film to take a shot at time travel, but it's the movie that broke barriers, and holds up the most out of Time After Time & Terminator, along with other early titles. This movie is so heavily guarded; a lot of people say it's almost a flawless movie, with good reason. With a low budget, even for 1985, of 19 million dollars, this movie made a lot of noise at the box office, taking home 389 million dollars!Before I dive into the characters, I just want to give Deborah Lynn Scott, Robert Iannaccone, Brian Callahan & Julie Starr Dresner, credit for the brilliant costume design. Michael J. Fox, as his first major role in a motion picture, puts on a phenomenal & energetic performance as Marty McFly, making his character very bold, and entertaining. His character development throughout the film brings a lot of an enjoyable wit and comedy. Christopher Llyod, who is most noticed for One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest, before Back to the Future, put on a trademark performance. Chris Llyod NAILED his performance as Doctor Emmett Brown. His character development during the second and third act was the best out of all the characters. He carried himself with this quirky & loud, yet brilliant and thoughtful attitude, that was admirable to all. Lea Thompson, as Lorraine McFly was one of the cringiest, yet best characters in the movie. Her character in the first act was whatever, and what she turns out to be in the second and third act, is hysterical. Thomas F. Wilson played a great, stereotypical bully, in Biff. He was a clichÃ© character, and meant to hate, but he is absolutely hilarious.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale was ahead of it's time, along with some of the scenes and risks they took. A very intelligent and creative script, that flowed just right for the 80's, then flowed even better with the 50's, adding consistent tongue and cheek humor.The score by the up and coming, Alan Silvestri, had this magical, yet suspenseful, and even a few sad tones. This score was absolutely phenomenal, backed up with a great song by Huey Lewis & the News, That's the Power of Love.Overall, I can completely understand why people would call this movie flawless. It is absolutely fantastic!! With only one notable award from the Academy Awards, being Best Sound Editing, this movie has a lot to be proud of, and A LOT of nomination worthy aspects. Robert Zemeckis set up the sequel perfectly, and if I was around in the late 80s, I would've went to go see it.",10,0,0,17 March 2020
Goodfellas," Top 5 Favorite Movie
","Goodfellas, directed & written by Martin Scorsese, produced by one of the best producers in the game today, in Irwin Winkler, is the most accurate, and my favorite mob movie of all time. Scorsese, Winkler & Pileggi crafted this beautifully told story, being nominated at the Oscars for Best Picture & Best Director. Marty displayed this incredible sense of direction, while pulling source material right out of Nicholas Pileggi's book, titled Wiseguys, based off of Henry Hill's life.Goodfellas is a masterpiece whichever way you want to look at it. The story was a true, authentic representation of not only Henry Hill's life, but what life was like in the mafia, back in the 60s/early 70s. Some scenes probably came off as theatrical, or done for amusement, but according to Henry Hill himself, the content is 99.9% accurate, and ultimately dumbed down. With the narration from Ray Liotta, it brought all of the content from the previous scene together, making everything flow much better throughout the film.The cast director in Ellen Lewis casted the absolute best, star studded cast possible! Each character had their own sense of comradeship. Ray Liotta was the star of this film. The attention to detail by all of the characters, especially Jimmy Burke, was nothing short of impeccable. After being so invested into his character throughout the movie, I did some further research on how he prepared for this film, and it only made his performance that much better, seeing the hard work he put in. His character development throughout the film is so bonkers! I changed my opinion on him a few times, due to all of the crazy antics he has to go through. The most notable performance of the film, was by one of my favorite actors, in Joe Pesci. He portrays Tommy De Simone's crazy, ludacris persona PERFECTLY, although he couldn't really embrace his physical structure, to say the least ðŸ˜‚. Pesci was nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, but fell short to Denzel Washington, in Glory. Bob De Niro put on yet another stellar performance. His character was heavily focused on, to help build our main 'antihero' in Ray Liotta. With a character with such a high stature, De Niro is the only casting that makes sense. Lorraine Bracco was the character the audience really felt for. She put on such a great, dramatic performance, selling every scene. She was also noticed at the Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, but came up short to Brenda Fricker, in My Left Foot. Paul Sorvino always does a great job in these type of roles, but this time, I wish we got a little more of him. For someone who really meant a lot in the true story, he didn't have too much screen time, but when he did, he made a nobale and witty statement everytime. Even though I absolutely loved Sorvino's performance, he was probably my least favorite character, due to the justice that wasn't served to his high caliber character. The only minor take away from the characters as a whole; all of these characters (except Lorraine Bracco) are equally as violent, but they dumbed a few characters down.The script by Martin Scorsese & Nicholas Pileggi (who also went on with Scorsese to do Casion), was BRILLIANT! With the popularity behind it, some of the dialogues were borrowed by other writers, who incorporated their tweaked version to their own work. The script was honorably nominated at the Oscars, and in my opinion, robbed by Alfred Uhry, who wrote Driving Miss Daisy. The script carried too much weight, being so witty, and sliding in plenty of laughs, to not win the award.The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus, who
did After Hours & the Last Temptation of Christ with Marty & went on to do The Departed & Gangs of New York as well with him; utilized so many brilliant tools to create such a beautiful picture, with immaculate frame work. Ballhaus utilized great steady cam work, with intelligent usage of freeze frames, to capture important moments. He also used these great, eye-level seeking shots, displaying the amazing scenery and characters. Come the final act, things got were little different, being much more high paced. Thelma Schoonmaker started utilizing the score and music more, to enchace the tone, and feelings. Schoonmaker kept up with her great edits, but started to incorporate snappy edits, with fast camera movements. This movie could've easily been three & a half, to four hours long, if they really wanted to capture everything. Alone, there was 36 minutes cut from the film, and everytime I see this film, I wonder what it would be like. Schoonmaker who was also nominated for an Oscar, being absolutely snubbed. This was one of, if not the best edited movie I've seen.The action was very stylish, gory, brutal, with a great 60s feel. The action was displayed almost to a T, but according to Henry Hill, it was dumbed down a little because things were way more explict.Overall, this will forever go down as, not only one of the best mafia movies, but one of the best movies of all time.PS, if you haven't seen the Joe Pesci rap video, DO SO ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",10,0,0,13 March 2020

","I grew up watching this movie all the time, loving it more and more every single time; Watching it now, I've come to realize that this is a hard pass! For a story that is bone dry, it tries way too hard, carrying itself like it's a masterpiece. The narrative has zero heart and charm, with some awful writing! The script is beyond dumb with so many pop culture references, it's overwhelming. Oscar is top ten worst protagonist in cinema history! These characters are super corny & cheesy with absolutely no charisma.",1,0,0,2 July 2020

","A very simple & cliché premise, with over the top characters. Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story has a lot of hit or miss jokes, but overall a fun hour & a half! Great late-night flick to turn your brain off.",4,0,0,30 June 2020
