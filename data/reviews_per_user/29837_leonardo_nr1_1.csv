Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat simply tries to offend, and he is great success!
","This movie is simply not for everyone. Cohen tries to shock, invoke feelings of disgust, unease, and simply show the silliness in the world. It's not only about the USA, people thinking that misunderstood the movie. It's about people in general, about our cultures and values, and how to simply mock them and point them out. The fact that he ridicules Jews as well shows he is able to make fun of himself as of others.The scene in the hotel was simply brilliant in my opinion. He crosses a line there for almost every norm and standard, and succeeds in finally really shocking me once more in a long time watching a movie. I was laughing and disgusted at the same time, an odd and rare accomplishment.You must have some major balls to do some of the things he does in this movie. He brilliantly smacks people in the face, and simply makes fun of us all. Either you love it or you hate it. I loved it, and haven't laughed so hard in a long time!",8,0,0,9 February 2009
