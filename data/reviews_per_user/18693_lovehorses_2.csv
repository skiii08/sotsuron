The Ring," Scary as sh*t
","Most people on here are saying that it is not scary and badly done, but I watched it last night (Halloween) and became so scared after 45 mins. that I was physically ill. I've never been more scared in my life. What i did see was good, though. I'll never watch it again.",Null,0,1,1 November 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," if it wasn't for the soundtrack...
",If it wasn't for the awsome songs in this movie I wouldn't have been able to get through it. one of the all time worst! i can't beleive how bad it was. i just wanted to rip my arm off so i would have something to throw at the movie screen. was not worth the money to see it!,1,12,30,24 May 2002
