Mission: Impossible III," Best kick off to a summer movie season in recent memory!
","I just got back from viewing quite possibly one of the better action/romantic/thrillers in a long-while. Needless to say, MI3 delivers in all ways that movie can. The acting was great and so was the casting. I could not see these actors being played by anyone else. The plot was good and not too hard to follow unlike the first Mission Impossible. As much crap as people give Tom Cruise for whatever reason, be it his couch-jumping antics or his choice in religion, it is really irrelevant because he truly is an amazing actor that can pull of so many different types of movies. Mission 3 is a combo of sorts in that involves elements of romance. The beginning scene sets the tone for the whole movie and that tone can be said in one word: gritty. I was not the only person in the theater to be shocked at Phillip Seymour's brilliant turn as Owen Davian, an arms dealer, who threatens to shoot Hunt's wife in the head unless Hunt tells him what he wants to know. Phillip Seymour Hoffman has set the bar high as it comes to future actors portraying crazy arm-dealing megalomaniacal villains. Tom Cruise is well, Tom Cruise and I cannot thank him enough for really completing the movie experience. He really makes a blockbuster as far as I am concerned. The supporting cast is stellar too. Kudos to Billy Crudup for his role as Ethan's friend and boss. Maggie Q and John Rhys Meyers are excellent as well. Ving Rhames is put to good use in Mission 3 unlike previous missions and I thank JJ Abrams for that. i'd also like to thank JJ for his brilliant eye, because the he gave us one of the best action sequences (the bridge assault) in the last ten years. Not to be outdone, the Shanghai/bungee/parachute stunt will blow you away. Out of all the MI, I can easily say that this one is the best. The music is great, the locations are great and more importantly the plot is coherent. Great Summer Popcorn Movie: 9/10",10,0,1,5 May 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," I still Can't Decide: Raiders or Crusade?
","I remember as a little kid always trying to stay awake watching Indiana Jones' movies, but never quite making it. When you are 7 years old, your attention span can only go for so long. However, when I reached my teen years, only then as I able to grasp how much of an impact the Indiana Jones' trilogy has impacted our culture and our movie going experience.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first and probably the most beloved entry in the series. I can't help but agree with many of those who praise it as the best, but then the awesomness of the Last Crusade creeps back into my consciousness. I can never decide which one is better, but for now this is a review on Raiders and not the Last Crusade.Not needing the go into the story so much, as I am sure other reviewers already have, let me just that the action does not stop from the minute you see the boulder chasing Indy in the Amazonian temple. All the action sequences are fantastic, and Raiders, I must admit contains the better villains, especially the man in black whose name escapes me at the moment. The heroine, Marion, played by Karen Allen is also probably the best heroine in the series too. She is strong, humorous, and believably pretty. Of course, no one ca review Raiders of the Lost Ark and not mention the scene where the Ark is opened. I'd call that one of the top ten scariest scenes in cinema history.",9,0,0,17 April 2006
Capote," Requires patience, but a truly fantastic piece of work
","What can I say, I expected a lot going into this film. My European history teacher, of all people, recommended this movie to me. I decided to give it a shot and brought along a friend that I felt would at least sit through a movie that did not have explosions or breast exposing sex scenes. Needless to say I was captivated by 'Capote'.The acting- Phillip Seymour Hoffman does a brilliant job as Truman Capote and I believe he will be the man to beat for Best Actor in a Motion Picture. He also provided the only 'comdeic' moments in a somber and quite depressing film. As far as Catherine Keener is concerned, she might as well grab an Oscar too as Harper Lee. It's truly funny to see her smiling at people who don't remember the title of her newly published book (To Kill a Mockingbird). Of course everyone else is fantastic, but these two really took the cake.The Plot- Well its really the story of Truman's obsession with Perry Smith, who along with his partner brutally murdered a family of 4 with a shotgun. The scene in which Perry explains the night of the murders is one truly gripping scene if not nauseating. The murders were truly 'In Cold Blood' as Capote's title of his book infers. Unfortunately, the film drags in a few places towards the end because you know that Perry is going to tell his story of that night but you keep waiting waiting and waiting. But when it comes that particular scene was worth it.The Film-It looks beautiful and the cinematography is haunting and somewhat beautiful.This film is a solid 8 and a strong contender for the Oscars. I wish it good luck and would not be disappointed to see it win.",10,0,0,4 February 2006
