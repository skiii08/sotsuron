Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A disappointment compared to the earlier classics
","It's a shame after 16 years that George Lucas couldn't come up with a bettter film.  He has great special effects but the characters are strangely lacking, which usually isn't the case with Star Wars films.Lucas needs to go back to the lessons of earlier films and remember it's the characters, not the effects, that matters.  All the Star Wars rip-offs proved that.  The film basically has a bunch of fancy effects and nothing more.  For avid Star Wars fans only.",Null,0,1,24 May 2001
