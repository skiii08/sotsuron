The Dark Knight," Joker to love
","Never like to give 10, and have never given 10. This is for me a strong 9.The best joker the world have ever seen.For new viewers: You would like to know that this is the ultimate introduction to Batman and to The Joker. you won't need too, but you should actually start with the first in this series of Nolan. --Anyway.. Most of this movie for me, evolves around 'The Batman'He has shown me the true colors of you unfortunately.....I know why you choose to have these little movie-sessions in broad daylight.I know why you're afraid to go out at night.The Batman.ENJOY",10,0,1,12 March 2015
