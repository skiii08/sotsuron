Avengers: Endgame," its good, IMHO infinity war was better
","That being said .. this movie is okay
decent time traveling storyline ... i give it a 8 because i wasnt really feeling the whole feminist scene in the middle of the battle field 2 out of all those woman can actually make a savage difference the rest are just wak
FAT THOR
Fat thor was awesome and funny .. and i liked him but i kinda wished they would have carried his infinity war character into this movie they made him weak and not as strong,
it would have ben awesome to see THORS depression reveal SO much ANGER towards thanos THAT HE unleashed the full power of the ODIN force , NOW THAT would have ben epikHULK
i love hulk but man they really wrote him out of both movies
it would have ben cool to see HULK finding out about the death of natasha ramonoff and then go into a FIT OF RAGE turning into WORLD BREAKER HULK now that alone i would have givn the movie a 10 ,, he would have destroyed thanosi felt like cap marvel was compeltly useles thruought the whole movie and probably shouldnt have even ben in the movie
and hand down my favorite scene was SCARLETTE WITCH showing thanos whos bossall in alll i give the movie a 8 .. for the final battle scene wich was pretty awesome
-2 cause of the slow pace,
lack of skreen time to baddass characters,
the forced fem fatale scene in the middle of the battle field
other then that its pretty good",7,0,0,16 May 2019
Groundhog Day," have u ever had DEJA VU ?
","I enjoyed this film
i love the concept of time how scary it could be being trapped in a time loop.
love story was okay, it is a little slow
there is no explanation on how he gets trapped in that loop and how he gets out he just gets the gurl and then hes able to continue thru time
i feel like there maybe more to the story then explained but all in all it was a good movie i give a 8 due to the slow pace
and the plot holes in the story line",10,3,4,18 May 2019
