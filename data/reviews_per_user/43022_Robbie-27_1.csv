Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wow....
","This was easily the most anticipated film of my life, and I have to say I was not disappointed.  After hearing scathing reviews from critics didn`t help things though.  What an amazing film!  How can you totally badmouth such cracking entertainment?!?!  I have NEVER seen anything like that pod race, and when that can be upstaged in the same film by a three-way climax that this film had  wow  No bad performances among them, even Jar Jar, who everyone seems to hate: me & my friends thought he was great!  Watto was also fantastic  scum of the highest order. As a matter of fact, there was not one character I disliked.  I didn`t know the plot, having somehow avoided all talk about it until I saw the film, and it was well worth it for that ending It`s Star Wars for a new generation, not to be compared with the original trilogy as so many special effects breakthroughs have happened since 1983.  One small gripe though; not enough of the villains.. But besides that small criticism; see it, be totally amazed, then see it again !!!!!",Null,0,0,17 July 1999
