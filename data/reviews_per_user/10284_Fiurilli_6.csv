War Dogs," Another disappointing summer movie
","In 'War Dogs' we follow Miles Teller and Jonah Hill as two young men trying to make money from the war in Iraq by selling weapons to the US army. The movie is directed by Todd Phillips who is better known for the 'The Hangover' trilogy.Right of the bat the movie tries to seem more clever than it actually is. Via a flash-forward that shows one of the main characters in a predicament the movie tries to create a sense of tension that would otherwise have been non-apparent. This quickly fades as the story is very predictable with characters that are not all that interesting considering their motives are never properly explained and very flimsy. Throughout the movie is some narration paired with title cards indicating different chapters. Most of the times the chapters do not seem any different which made these title cards unnecessary and it is clear they were just added afterwards in as a last ditch effort to make the movie more interesting. Halfway trough the movie almost comes to a grinding halt and from thereon out it never really manages to get the viewer's interest back.The directing was very bland, considering not one scene was shot in a very interesting fashion. Often times it seemed as if the movie does not really know what it wants to be. Sometimes character's respond to a certain situation in a comedic fashion while other times the tone is shifted to a more serious one. Todd Phillips never really tries to mix in some of his own style and with another director the movie would've probably turned out roughly the same. The only redeeming factor of the movie are the actors themselves as they did a decent job at portraying their characters, though ultimately not one performance was very memorable. In the end 'War Dogs' joins the 2016 collection of disappointing summer movies.My rating: 4/10",4,26,52,22 August 2016
Suicide Squad," A forgetful super hero movie
","Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto and others star in Suicide Squad, the latest movie by writer/director David Ayer. The movie has us follow a group of bad guys who are forced to work together and defeat other evil incarnations. It is however not in their nature to team up, but they are forced to with a remote controlled explosive device that is planted into their neck, if they do not follow their orders the device is activated and they die. Not obeying their leader would be equal to committing suicide, hence the name Suicide Squad.In the first hour of the movie all the different characters are introduced. This does not work all that well however as it is very hard to become invested in a character when all you know about them is information that other characters say trough expositional dialogue. Not all characters get a proper introduction however as some are just shoved in there. One of the characters is only introduced with a simple line of dialogue for example. The introductions, though lengthy, really do not provide a lot of background and when the movie wants you to care about them more it throws in a simple flashback.The actors portraying the different characters overall did a great job. Sometimes the performances felt a bit off, but I got the impression that the movies director was more to blame for this. This is especially true for Jared Leto's character 'The Joker' who felt more like a simple thug with a mental disorder rather than the bad-ass mobster he should have been. The movies main villains felt a little bit overpowered (which forced them to not use their power to their full extent when fighting the Suicide Squad) but the action sequences between them and the Suicide Squad were all fairly well done. There are a few moments where slow motion is lazily used to create a bit more tension but never enough that it becomes a major problem. There isn't really an action scene so good that you'll remember it in a few years time though, but on the other hand there also isn't one so bad that'll accomplish the same either. In the end 'Suicide Squad' works fine as a brainless action movie and fans of the characters will certainly enjoy it to some extent. People who do not know the characters will probably enjoy it a lot less though as the movie never establishes a good connection between them and the viewer and for a movie that should be just about the Suicide Squad themselves this is a major flaw.My rating: 4/10",3,8,19,5 August 2016
Split," A return to form
","Almost every director has a period one can call their 'golden years'. For some directors these last their entire career, while for others it merely consist of one or maybe two movies . A few years back director M. Night Shyamalan experienced his 'golden years' with three consecutive movies much loved by fans. Back then it was no wonder that Shyamalan was often given the nickname ''the golden boy''. As a fan of his earlier work it was sad to see that he never came close to accomplishing the wonderful craftsmanship he showed during his 'golden years' with movies such as The Sixth Sense. Every film released by Shyamalan after Signs was a major disappointment and after just a few movies he fell from grace reaching his lowest point in 2010 with The Last Airbender. However in 2015 something changed when Shyamalan released the comedy/horror movie The Visit. Although this still wasn't a very good film it did provide a very fun experience and it seemed as if Shyamalan was beginning to understand what made his earlier work so much fun to watch. All the more reasons to be excited about his latest film Split, which follows actor James McAvoy in the role of Kevin Crumb, a man with 23 distinct personalities. In the beginning of the movie one of these personalities kidnaps three young women who he holds hostage in some sort of underground facility. These women must try to survive while facing Crumb's many personalities. Things take a turn for the worse however, as Crumb starts to develop a monstrous 24th personality.If one were to judge this movie based on its premise it's easy to disregard this film completely. Another dumb movie by Shyamalan that will probably be just as terrible as his earlier film 'After Earth', right? While the trailers may give this impression, just a few minutes in it is clear that 'Split' is a different beast altogether. Right off the bat Split takes a hold of the audience and exerts a grip so tight that one can only forget its ridiculous premise and suspend their disbelief altogether. The story of Kevin is very interesting to watch especially since the mystery surrounding him seems to be growing by the minute. The manner in which questions are answered is perfectly balanced between conversations and even though the dialogue is exposition heavy as a result it never actually seems that way. This can be attributed to the fact that most conversations have a certain sense of realism such that it never appears as if the information is being told to the audience instead of to the characters on the screen. For the first time in a few years Shyamalan has created an amazing story and although it does take a few twist and turns that seem out of place it is incredibly fun to experience.Shyamalan's story is also very well presented on the big screen. The eeriness of the events surrounding Kevin is very well framed by the slow moving shots that often linger a little bit longer than usual. Combined with the story itself this in turn provides some great psychological horror with a tension that almost always appears to be at a boiling point. This sense of tension never lets up and it alone is what can pull one through the few moments where the scrip falters. Scattered throughout the film are some beautiful shots and a lot of times what is actually happening on the screen is very well mirrored with the manner in which it is framed. Shyamalan and cinematographer Mike Gioulakis have created a very good looking film but by far the most noteworthy aspect of Split is the amazing acting by James McAvoy in the role of Kevin and seven of his personalities. McAvoy really owns the part and presents every personality very much as its own character. Every second with McAvoy on the screen was a delight to see and his performance alone made Kevin's journey worth the watch.All in all Split is a very solid movie that is definitely worth the price of admission. Both the script and the direction by M. Night Shyamalan are very good and on top of that all is the amazing acting performance by James McAvoy. If you are a fan of the horror/thriller genre then Split is a must watch for you, however even if you are not it is worth checking out regardless.",8,2,11,29 January 2017
Sausage Party," A missed opportunity
","Animation type movies have been increasing in popularity over the last couple of years. In 2016 alone more than 50 animation style movies have been released. These type of movies are mostly for children to enjoy and, although they're still fairly enjoyable for adults, are never really meant for an adult audience. Seth Rogan and consorts have set out to change that by creating the first ever R-rated animation movie called 'Sausage Party'. In this movie we follow a living hotdog called Frank who lives in a supermarket together with other food products who are also amongst the living. All of them view us humans as gods and are joyfully awaiting the day they are picked up, placed in a shopping cart ready to go towards the promised land. When they get there though they'll quickly discover that things aren't what they thought it would be as they are devoured by their revered gods without remorse. Eventually Frank and his friends get chosen, but they are quickly separated after a horrible shopping cart incident. The rest of the movie has us follow Frank and a few of his friends as they try to find each other while discovering more about the terrible gods us humans actually are.As an animation style movie 'Sausage Party' really isn't one of the prettiest of the bunch. That does not mean all that much though since Pixar has really spoiled us as of late. The universe that they were able to create was still very colorful and it did actually feel like a living and breathing world. This is really quite an accomplishment considering it was done with a budget that is only ten percent of the one 'Finding Dory' had. The way some characters were animated was also pretty good, but it is quite clear a little more thought should have gone into their overall design as the universe of 'Sausage Party' is not all that consistent. Sometimes the food itself is alive while other times it's just the packaging that's alive and in some special cases this holds true for both of them. The manner in which the characters are presented also varies a lot. Most characters only have a cartoonish face with stick figure hands and feet while others feature a design that actually suits the type of food they are. An example of this would be Sammy Bagel Jr. whose mouth is the big gaping hole in the middle of his body. All of this does not take away from the overall enjoyment of the film, but a little more polish would have gone a long way.Scattered throughout this film are some amazing comedic moments. For instance the aforementioned shopping cart incident was brilliantly framed as if it was a scene taken straight out of 'Saving Private Ryan', with some minor alterations of course. Even some small moments were very well done. The very first time the f-word is uttered is a great example of this since it was initially presented as if one was watching a PG-rated movie. Most of the jokes do not reach this level however and a lot of them just aren't that clever. It is quite clear that the creators wanted to use their R-rating to the fullest extent and the supposedly funny part in a lot of jokes wasn't really the joke itself but more so the absurdity of it. Initially this works really well however after just a few jokes this novelty quickly wears off causing a lot of jokes to feel repetitive and most of them are dead on arrival. The jokes are also not that well distributed throughout the film. There are almost no jokes in the second act which was probably intentional in a failed attempt at trying to go out with a bang. A lot of jokes seemed forced in and it is obvious that a lot of characters were only created for some minor food puns. What does work really well is the very decent voice acting done by Seth Rogan, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and many others. To me it seemed as if they themselves were having a lot of fun recording their voices which definitely helped make some hit-or-miss jokes succeed.What plagues this film are some weird creative decisions. Riddled throughout the movie are some of the worst attempts at social commentary I have ever seen. Now social commentary itself is not a bad thing and it can really enhance a movie when it is presented with some subtlety. That is not the case in 'Sausage Party' though as almost every scene kept hammering on the idea that one should never have faith in something without questioning it. It is possible that this decision was made in an attempt to parody most animation movies since a lot of them feature social commentary to some extent, but it misses its mark regardless of intent. What could also be considered a parody to some extent would be the movies main antagonist. This character is extremely annoying and only has a minor influence on the overarching story. Again the creators of 'Sausage Party' make a weird creative decision since the overall scenario was already a perfect villain. The movie really did not need a physical one. Ultimately 'Sausage Party' is a missed opportunity. The few good sequences really hint at what could have been an excellent comedic movie. If a little more thought and polish had gone into its creation this certainly would have been the case, but as of right now it's just a mediocre summer flick.My Rating: 5/10",5,0,4,7 September 2016
Whiplash," An absolute masterpiece
","There have been great directors in the past such as Stanley Kubrick, Sergio Leone, Alfred Hitchcock and many others. Often times people fondly remember these directors and their movies and wonder which of the directors working today will be considered one of the greats in the near future. In my opinion there are many great candidates such as Wes Anderson and Christopher Nolan, however there is a new kid in town. Damien Chazelle has officially put his stamp on the movie scene with his latest film 'La La Land' which has already received six Academy Awards and seven Golden Globes. I've already watched 'La La Land' in cinemas twice and can't recommend it highly enough and so I was curious what his other movie 'Whiplash' had to offer.In 'Whiplash' Chazelle tells the story of a teenage boy Andrew who's dream it is to become the world's greatest drummer. In order to achieve his dreams he enrolls at a music conservatory known for its very competitive jazz band helmed by Fletcher. Fletcher is no ordinary conductor and has a rather unorthodox style that does not always resonate with every member of the band. There's a lot more to this story than this, however part of the experience is not knowing what to expect. I'd hate to ruin this for anyone, but what I can tell you is that this is one of the most original stories I've seen in a long time. It's very well put together and unfolds masterfully with a lot of fun and unexpected twists and turns. Characters are very well defined and always seem to act according to their beliefs. Both Andrew and Fletcher are very interesting characters and their story lines interact beautifully. The dialogue itself is also very realistic and often appears as if it's been taken from everyday life. The script is also very well balanced as it's very serious at times but also funny when it needs to be.Behind the characters of Andrew and Fletcher are Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Both characters were already interesting enough however the actors give them an incredible amount of depth. Teller really makes you feel for his character and when he is pushed to his limits you can't help but want to reach out through the screen and give him a helping hand. In any other movie Teller would easily have been the star of the film, however it's extremely hard to pick favourites with Simmons in the supporting role. His character is a very strict music conductor and Simons gives his all to portray this fact. If the actor is anything like his character than I would advise anyone to stay far away from him. However one of the best things about Simmons his act is that he always makes you feel as if there still is a human being hiding inside Fletcher. I would argue that with 'Whiplash' both actors have come very close to reaching the top of their abilities, but I would hope that the future will prove me wrong. What ties 'Whiplash' together is Damien Chazelle with a directional style that is absolutely stellar. Although the movie may be slow for some, in my opinion the pacing is very well thought out. The story progresses very steadily and there is never a moment where it feels as if nothing is happening. With the use of low level lighting Chazelle pulls you into every scenario and combined with the constant use of the drums this creates a sensation unlike any other movie. The drumming especially gets under your skin and the constant sense of tension this provides perfectly mirrors that which is present between the character. Even though the movie is not classified as such it most definitely feels like a thriller and I would personally rate it amongst movies such as 'The Shining' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' solely in terms of suspense.Damien Chazelle has literally created a masterpiece and if I would have to point out a flow I'd first have to watch it countably many times. However 'Whiplash' is so captivating that I would probably forget to look. The movie is extremely well directed with acting performances that are amongst some of the best I've ever seen. It features a unique story with an ending that's the cherry on top of the an already delicious cake. This movie is perfect in every sense of the word and gets a perfect five stars out of five.",10,1,3,25 March 2017
Arrival," Amongst the best movies of the year
","The year 2016 has not been a very good one for any avid moviegoer as it is filled with mediocrity. It has not been a complete disaster though and there were still quite a lot of movies that were worth the watch. The ones that can be considered as the cream of the crop however have been few and far in between. For these reasons it almost feels like a small celebration when a movie releases that appears to fit into the last category. In a lot of ways this seemed to be the case for 'Arrival' as almost everything surrounding this movie seemed to suggest that this was going to a modern- day masterpiece or at the very least the greatest movie of the year. It featured an amazing cast and all of the media released beforehand was beautiful to look at. If the past has thought us anything it is almost a fact that movies with sky high expectations like these can only be a disappointment. Can 'Arrival' live up to the hype?The story of 'Arrival' is centered around Dr. Louise Banks, a world renown linguist played by Amy Adams. The life of Dr. Banks changes dramatically when aliens land in twelve different locations around the globe. The United States calls upon Dr. Banks to find the answer to one simple question: 'Why are they here?' At the helm is the critically acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve who has been on fire in the last couple of years with movies such as 'Incendies', 'Sicario' and one of my personal favourites 'Prisoners'. Once again Villeneuve, together with cinematographer Bradford Young, has managed to create a gorgeous looking movie. Almost every shot is simply mesmerizing to look at and a few made my jaw figuratively drop in amazement. All the shots merge together into one interwoven web of beauty and it isn't hard to argue that 'Arrival' is the best looking movie of the year. Ever present throughout the film is a great sense of tension that will keep many sitting on the edge of their seat. This tension paired with the relative slow pace of most shots and a soundtrack that is often oozing with theme represents a firm grip that never lets go once it has gotten a hold of the audience. My eyes were simply glued to the screen wanting to take in everything this movie had to offer.Part of this can also be attributed towards the story this movie tells. The idea of aliens landing on the planet is not very unique, however the manner it is presented in is anything but. Following Dr. Banks' journey in understanding these aliens was incredibly fun and the manner they interacted with one another felt very realistic. Most events surrounding Dr. Banks also feel very real and it isn't hard to imagine that should aliens visit us in real life it'll look similar to how it is presented in this movie. The story 'Arrival' tells could easily have been one of the best we've seen in recent years, but there are certain elements which keeps it from reaching its full potential. Certain events feel forced or are simply glossed over, present are a handful of potholes and quite a few characters feel useless in comparison to Dr. Banks. There's also a bit of narration present in the middle of the movie which feels very awkward and misplaced and when the story of 'Arrival' meets its end it wraps up a little too neatly. A bit more polish should have gone into the storytelling however as it stands this still is one of the most interesting stories you'll be able to see in cinemas this year with a final act that makes the entire movie appear in a different light.Something I cannot speak highly enough of is the superb acting from the main cast. Amy Adams in particular really gave her all with a performance that was absolutely stellar. Often without words she shows that there is more to her character than meets the eye and there is always a sense of an emotional struggle going on within her. Jeremy Renner, as Dr. Banks' love interest and physicist Ian Donnelly, also brought a great performance and the only real criticism would be that Renner does not always convey the sense that he understands what he is saying when he's talking about science related topics. Given his performance it is sad to see that the movie did not give his character the attention it deserved and that, in the grand scheme of things, his character did not attribute to all that much. The performances of Renner and Adams on their own are superb, what's even better though is the great chemistry between them and overall it was a lot of fun to see them interact with one another on the big screen.Ultimately 'Arrival' did not achieve my unrealistically high expectations and it certainly wasn't the masterpiece it very easily could have been. It still is a very solid movie that most definitely deserves its spot amongst the best movies of the year. The acting performances 'Arrival' has to offer are incredible and the visual style of Denis Villeneuve is even more amazing. I do think that this is a movie that can only be fully appreciated after a second watch and as of right now I can only rate it a slightly conservative 8 out of 10.",9,4,10,11 December 2016
