Gremlins," A classy little Horror/comedy
","Gremlins is a film that I missed as a kid and its a real pity cause its awesome. Everyone I know thinks its a truly special movie and so do I. The story is a really cool and original one. A man visting China town picks up a pet for his son. Not any old pet though, this is a mowgi and there are 3 rules that go with it. Don't get in sunlight,Never get it wet and never feed it after midnight. Billy the boy who receives it calls it Gizmo and things go fine until he gets Gizmo wet and he multiplys. Then by accident he feeds the new mowgwi food after midnight and they become GREMLINS!!!!! Its a cracking film filled with laughs and nasty parts galore that will have everyone either in stitches or behind the couch. The Gremlins are nasty critters that like mischief so the film got a high 15 rating here in the UK. However fear not this is a family film through and through with nothing but Gremliney pranks the whole way through. The acting ain't class buts its done to a decent level and Hoyt Axton makes a great Mr. Peltzer. The characters are cool Billy, Mrs Deagle but not just the human characters the cute mowgi Gizmo and evil Gremlin leader Stripe are acts of Genius. See Gremlins with the family are with friends its the best way to do it. The Gremlins themselves are puppets and they looked cool then but they look even cooler now. Its plain and simply a great little piece of cinema.",8,1,3,11 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Best of the star wars prequels
","Many people have said that Star wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace is the worst of all the Star Wars films. Well whilst it doesn't match any of the original trilogy it is a better film than either of the other prequels. The film follows the story of a young Anakin Skywalker after he is picked up by two Jedi on his home planet. One of the Jedi in question is a youthful Obi Wan Kenobi played by Ewan McGregor. The other Qui Gonn Jinn is played very well by Liam Neeson and its probably the best performance the film offers. The other part of the story involves an evil federation who wish for the Queen of a planet named Naboo to sign a treaty between them. The federation is run by the evil Darth Sideous and the very nasty and skillful Darth Maul. The stories cross well and in the end its an all and out battle for the planet. The acting and dialogues are wooden for the most part but with the exception of Harrison Ford the franchise has never strayed from simple and adequate performances. As for the dialogues, again Star wars is certainly not what I associate with fantastic scripts. Indeed it is the action sequences and mythology that powers this film along. It carrys that certain something that the other prequels lacked and which the original films were so rich in. That certain something is fun and the film has it in abundance. The visual effects are top of the range and the lightsaber fight at the end is the most spectacular the series has seen. Compared to the Limp Attack of the clones and forgettable Revenge of the sith Menace is a classic.So kick back and enjoy it for what it is. One kick ass Futuristic Rollar coaster ride.",6,0,1,17 March 2006
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Without a doubt the most tastless comedy ever. Its also one of the funniest
","South Park bigger longer and uncut is an absolutely brilliant film. It has a great story , great characters and a hell of a lot of great laughs. Our favourite gang of boys Kenny, Kyle, Stan and the everhilarious Cartman sneak into a new R rated film. Its full of profanitys and it warps all four of the boys minds and causes them to spout 4 letter words in abundance. The film is from Canada and nor School or parents are pleased at the boys new found vocabulary so they set up Mothers against Canada. It eventually leads to a war brewing and many Hilarius sequences. For the first big screen outing creaters Trey Parker and Matt Stone have decided not to update the animation but keep it the way it is, in fact there are a couple of jokes at the expense of the crude character design throughout the film. 99% 0f the jokes work very well and I found myself laughing most of the time which with a comedy is definitely a good thing. However the film is nigh flawless apart from one ill judged set of Characters. Satan is funny for a while but his bedroom scenes with Sadamm Hussein are not and they will only cause this perfectly good film to get slated as Homophobic. That said other Gay character big Gay Al is very funny and there are also some celebrities involved, including Winona Ryder doing some funny stuff with ping-pong balls. So all in all its a good first cinema adventure for the gang but the pity is, as the years go on it looks like it could be their last.",9,0,1,12 March 2006
Superbad," Funny and engaging teen comedy
","Superbad 2007, 118mins, 15 Director: Greg Mottola Cast includes: Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Bill Hader, Christopher Mintz-PlasseIt's really been Judd Apatows year, the comedy guru steered Knocked Up to #2 in the US domestic charts bettered only by the pirate fuelled adventures of Johnny Depp and co. on it's opening weekend. Then several weeks later Superbad hit theatres this time with Apatow producing, the magic still hit home the feature managed to take $32 million on it's opening weekend alone, on a mere $20 million budget. Both pictures also drew great reviews marking a mammoth year for Apatow, and based on Superbad he probably deserves mucho credit. The film depicts two pals Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) very different people in one grossly over dependent friendship. Seth is foul mouthed and obsessed with sex, Evan is more controlled and a lot less crazy about intercourse. Both are socially outcast but when invited to the last big party before they graduate the boys and their nerdy tag along Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) acquire a fake I.D and attempt to get a massive booze haul, so as to impress the girls they like and try to lose that one thing all teenage boys want to see the back off. Their virginity. The film is set really into two stories that off Seth and Evan which eats up two thirds of the screen time, and that of Fogell and two lovable but inept cops played by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. The two are conjoined at the beginning and at the end, but the middle section splices between the two. The film is written in the same crude but clever manner that films like American Pie and The 40 year Old Virgin (another Apatow product) big hits in recent years. It's nice to see a teen comedy that whilst containing all the same elements of the genre, also has a heart, soul and some extremely familiar situations and gags. Films like Road Trip, Pledge This and Van Wilder only maintain half of that equation and as a result are only ever half as good as Superbad indeed in the case of the Paris Hilton DTV movie, they can be a lot worse than even that. The performances are all excellent, Hill can be a tad irritating at times but it's well tempered by Cera's always charming turn. The two share great chemistry, the audience truly believes in their 10 year friendship. As Fogell Christopher Mintz-Plasse really gets the majority of the laughs, he's not a character with any real emotional core but his hilarious I.D (he names himself only McLovin) and his antics with Rogen and Hader are just about the funniest things in the film. Speaking of that duo they're also very good, particularly Hader as the more unstable of the two. One of the key problems the film has is it's lack of development with any female characters. The two chicks the lead duo are after are good looking and pleasant but nothing more. The young actresses do fine with the material I expect they where given, it's just the material itself feels light in the load. The jokes are usually amusing with several laugh out loud moments interspersed within the movie. Obviously a few gags don't work (a sequence involving a young child drawing dicks didn't do it for me) but generally the observations made by screenwriters Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen are funny, witty and surprisingly affecting and familiar. Within the Summer it was released I found only The Simpsons Movie funnier. At two hours director Greg Mottola lets the film drag on 10 minutes to long, but to make the emotional points he needs the man is right to take the picture past the standard 90 minute runtime for this sort of fare. Some parties have read into a gay subtext within the production, I didn't pick up on that, just that these where two friends very close to each other. Seeing as the film also points out that both guys are going to different colleges, the film also deals with the partition of this friendship. Some of the conversations surrounding this are really well done and tug a little at the audience's heart strings. Superbad has a few flaws but none are fatal. The film is funny and emotionally engaging which is what it really needs to be, and thus some of the dud jokes and 2-D characters are easy to forgive. The film offers enjoyment and a little more, which is much more than most of it's over stuffed genre can muster. It ain't Supergood, but I'd certainly give it a watch.",7,0,2,27 December 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Better than part two but thats faint praise
","The world really didn't need another Resident Evil movie, the previous outings where in no way great, indeed the second installment was for the most part god damn awful. This the third (and please studio execs final) in the series feels dull and very repetitive, the feeling of deja vu is prominent and seeing as the initial parts were pretty poor thats in no way a good thing. Milla Jovovich is the kind of actress who looks great but simply should quit and become a full time model. It's shocking how dodgy her performance is here, all wooden stares and wrist flicking knife action. The character was never sympathetic but Jovovich hasn't managed to inject any 3-D aspects into the character, which considering it's over three pictures is a bad show. I enjoyed some of the action, indeed one particular sequence which a the viewer will revel in, but altogether the director of Highlander brings the same bland tricks and turns we see in every video game movie, however the picture is pretty short ensuring it's game over pretty quick.",3,16,46,19 September 2007
Silent Hill," Its good by game adaptation standards.
","Video games never seem to translate well to film, or most of the time anyway. Once in a blue moon you do get one that isn't a total stinker like the first Tomb Raider movie or Alien V.S predator, but even then they rarely turn out to be better than average. Silent Hill for these reasons is definitely one of the best game to film translations but that sadly, doesn't make it a great piece of cinema. Don't get me wrong its entertaining stuff, and a good Saturday or Friday night movie, but looking at the cast and crew involved along with the undeniable quality of the source material it's really a bit of a pity it isn't better. The Story follows Rose, who's daughter Sharon is sleepwalking and when she does she talks about a place called Silent Hill. Rose decides to take Sharon to the town of Silent Hill in the hope that what is clearly disturbing her daughters mind can be resolved when she see's the place. The place itself is now a ghost town, abandoned for years it would seem, however when Rose and Sharon reach the outskirts of the town they have an accident that leaves both mother and daughter knocked out. When Rose wakes up Sharon is missing, and its up to her and Police officer Cybil to find the little girl, in a town where everything is far from what it seems. The high point of silent hill is undoubtedly its visual aspects. Director Christophe Gans has created a place both creepy and hauntingly beautiful, and the monsters that inhabit the town are some of the best I've seen on the silver screen in a good while. Screewriter Roger Avery can't replicate that success in his script however. Its wooden and far to long and at times the heavy script slows the film down horribly. Its admirable what Avery's tried to do, build a little more character and humanity into a genre that so often lacks it, but in the end he doesn't pull it of. The performances on the other hand are solid and believable. Rhada Mitchell makes a good fist of the leading role, and young Jodelle Ferland who has to play multiple parts as the story develops is a name to look out for in the future. Laurie Holden and Sean Bean aren't taxed by easy parts, though when it counts they get by just fine. Its also commendable that the film has gone the whole 9 yards and grasped an R rating. The source material requires the more adult and mature rating a Pg-13 certificate would have doubtless not been enough to coax up the required effects and mature tension.",6,4,7,21 February 2007
Van Helsing," Van Helsing the one name we can all enjoy
","Van Helsing is Universals homage to classic monsters Dracuala, the wolfman and Frankenstein., and just for the record its a pretty darn good homage at that. The story goes as follows Van Helsing played by an effective Hugh Jackman is a monster hunter who is used by the Catholic Church to vanquish evil. He is sent to Transylvania were he meets Princess Anna played by Kate Beckinsale who whilst not exactly putting in a great performance does remain very sexy. There he finds out that her family are ruled over by an evil curse and that they will never enter heaven until the evil count dracuala is killed. The film is silly.It is not a masterpiece but it is good fun. I was not expecting to see it get a high user rating and indeed at 5.3 out of 10 it certainly doesn't however to me Van Helsing is easily a 7 due to the fact it is spectacularly enjoyable and very camp throughout. Richard Roxburugh was not an inspired choice as Dracuala as he makes quite a hash of it but everyone else is at least average in their role. In fact Hugh Jackman was born to play Van Helsing as he adds great style to a great character. I have to hand to Sommers and his crew, the movie has great effects and is well edited throughout. The script is often sharp and always silly so it is an easy movie to enjoy. Its not perfect but hell Van Helsing is one cool way to start a summer season.",7,0,1,11 March 2006
Aliens," Could be the greatest sequel of all time.
","Sequels rarely stand up to the original. Jaws, Jurassic Park and Predator are all big Hollywood franchises that started at a very high standard but as time continued they simply grew worse and worse. However there are those sequels that many believe to be better than their predecessors. The Godfather part 2 and The Empire strikes back are a few of the names but in my opinion the best of this rare breed is the 2nd in the Alien saga. Aliens. The story starts with Ripley being found in space, shes has been floating their for 56 years but due to hyper sleep hasn't aged a day. The company Weyland Yutani picks here up and brings here back to a space station, where She tells them of her encounter of the Alien, which is met with ridicule and disbelief. However the company looses contact with the farmers that mine on the alien planet and together with a group of marines Ripley returns to face her demons. The acting is the best the series ever offered with Sigourney Weaver picking up an Oscar nomination and rightly so. Michael Biehn and Lance Hennrikson are very impressive, giving great depth to their characters. Carrie Henn is a great new comer, but for some odd reason has never worked again. The thrills are in high supply here as are the often grisly scares. The Aliens look even meaner here than they did in the original and the Queen when she appears is possibly the most frightening creature ever to grace are screens. Another great point Aliens offers is the fact you care for its characters, Even the asshole marine types. This means that when ever peril is near we feel even more anxious, simply because we have grown attached to those for whom the danger looms. Few movies these days have that quality, indeed the only action orientated film of the last 15 years that had this factor is the original Jurassic Park. So to conclude Aliens is really worth seeing. Its well acted, well written and highly entertaining. You would be a fool to give this one a miss.",10,4,6,4 April 2006
Alien vs. Predator," Fun
","Avp was never going to be a masterpiece. It was never going to have the majesty of Alien and the sheer terror of Aliens. No those things were never going to be in AVP, however AVP has its own little weapon. Its great fun. The story is the simplest of the year. A group of scientists find an ancient pyramid and go to explore. There they find themselves trapped in a war between Aliens and Predators and they are the bait. At 100 min long the movie moves quickly and the fights are furious. All aspects of Aliens and Predators are seen here from the chestbursters and facehuggers to the predators lethal arsenal of weapons. Sanaa Lathan plays the lead and whilst she ain't sigourny Weaver she makes a mighty fine fist of it. Its a pity everyone else is poor even the usually cool Ewan Bremmner. Lance Hennrikson is also on show but his appearance only causes you to make unfavourable comparisons to Aliens in which he played the Android. The beasts have never been nastier thanks to Paul Anderson who makes a decent directorial effort despite some sloppy editing. Its no classic but Avp is good fun.",5,1,2,11 March 2006
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Very good sequel
","The Lost World is the sequel to the 1993 classic Jurassic Park. Whilst this film is not as good as the original it does stand up well as a sequel. Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm has been asked to return to another Island were Dinosaurs have been allowed to live without cages. Malcolm refuses but when he finds out his paleontolagist girlfriend is already there he goes with a team of documentariens to rescue her. However several accidents ensue and they are left stranded on the Island with a second party. The film does not have the all round strength of the first and is far more dependant on thrills and its visual effects this time round. It does however succeed as good entertainment and its better than the third installment in the franchise by quite a bit. The Dino sequences are handled well with the Raptors in the long grass being the highlight of those and quite possibly the entire film. The T-rex features strongly again ( and this time there's two of them) along with a new and nasty little green dinosaur compsagnathus. The acting is'nt Oscar worthy or anything like it but the characters do have some charm and when they are put in danger you care what happens to them which is always a good sign. It does suffer a little from a bloated and anti climatic ending that is funny for about 2 minutes but I wont spoil it for you none the less. I give the Lost World its high rating because it does exactly what it sets out to do, entertain us. So I think its fair we overlook some of its flaws as with any kind of blockbuster sequel they are always there.",7,99,142,11 March 2006
I Am Legend," Entertaining Will Smith flick, but not as good as the book
","I Am Legend 2007, 101mins, 15 Director: Francis Lawrence Cast includes: Will Smith, Alice Braga, Charlie Tahan, Salli Richardson, Willow Smith, Dash MihokWritten in 1954 Richard Matheson's I Am Legend is among my favourite books ever. The text is in novella format and yet along with Orwell's Animal Farm it never ceases to amaze me how potent and utterly brilliant the book is, within it's tiny format I Am Legend achieves more than the entire Harry Potter saga. It's been filmed thrice, during the 50's with Vincent Price in the lead and entitled The Last Man On Earth, twenty years later this time with Charlton Heston in the Omega Man and now in 2007 with Will Smith in the first production to maintain the sources name. Funnily for such a fan of the book this is the first adaptation I've seen, it's pleasing to see the pages brought so fluently to life on the silver screen, but in terms of book to movie transfers it's Lord Of The Rings light. The story for those unaware is that of Robert Neville (Will Smith) a brilliant Government scientist, and as of five years ago the last man on earth. The world has become thronged with vampire cum zombie monsters, a consequence of a virus that hit half a decade ago turning people into these rabid and senseless villains. They can only operate in dark and so during the day New York is Robert's playground, by night he's reduced to hiding in his sealed off house. Neville is trying desperately to find a cure and reverse the disease that has turned his fellow human sinto shadows of their former selves, but whilst he may be immune the monsters are keen to taste his blood. I Am Legend is directed by Constantine helmer Francis Lawrence, the man exhibits the same strengths he did in that picture, the visuals of New York he conjurs up are eerie yet awesome and he builds up a strong central character well. Given that the source is better and that on this occasion he's blessed with the ever watchable Smith instead of Keanu 'forest' Reeves he still deserves a pat on the back for getting these elements so perfectly zoned. I can only do this review from the perspective of one who has read the text and so one of my biggest issues surrounds that, so if you're a Matheson virgin and intend to stay that way (why you would is beyond me...) bump the picture's rating up to 8/10. However there is one universal flaw and thats with the presentation of the infected, in a post 28 Days Later world these weird looking super goblins just aren't that scary and we don't really see enough of them to think otherwise. The CGI surrounding the creatures is by turns good and by turns bad. The deer we see Neville hunting in New York look great and one scene in a darkened warehouse features some fine use in terms of creating the zombies. In the better lit scenes however they aren't convincing enough, and the creature design is dubious to say the least. The film does have a fnatastic performance from Smith and in a later plot development Alice Braga. So far based on other performances this year I wouldn't hesitate to give Smith an Oscar nomination and whilst Braga isn't present for long enough she at least deserves hearty credit. The two carry the film superbly and if ever a category for 'best performing animal' opens up Sam Nevilles dog deserves a look in. The connection between Dog and man is engaging and fantastic, this is one of the deviations from the book I thought worked well. Some of the other changes don't however feel as satisfying, the way in which Nevilles family perish (shown through flashback) is unconvincing and slightly clichéd and at times one feels to much is absent. In the book at least one villain is built up, here we get virtually nothing. The finale is also slightly altered, more upbeat but not in a senseless Hollywood way. The change feels fine on the big screen and is still far grimer than most endings within it's respective genre. The action is well done and there are some scenes that are pure action, others purely horror. The book doesn't contain many of these but in the end with a Will Smith Holiday movie they where going to be essential. In the end I enjoyed most of them and they complimented the fantastic cinematography well, but again there was more within the source material than big bangs and awe inspiring landscapes. In the end I Am Legend is an above average film and given the recent output like Eragon and The Dark Is Rising it's a way above average page to screen adaptation. However one feels that Cinematography, Will Smith and Alice Braga to the side the film would be a lot weaker which suggested heavily that the material has been slightly mishandled. It's more than strong enough to carry itself yet here it feels a little patchy. The movie is good entertainment and features a great central performance but it isn't legend. Richard Matheson's book on the other hand most certainly is.",7,1,2,27 December 2007
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Weak action film
","Resident Evil was an enjoyable Zombie blasting piece of cheese. Now we are faced with the Sequel apocalypse and it really isn't up to scratch. The action sequences may be well constructed and the lighting throughout is perfect, but apart from that its a confused and thin adventure. The story involves a good many Zombies and a rather unimpresssive super villain so you can imagine its pretty predictable. Milla Jovovich reprises her role from the original and to be honest I cant remember anybody elses face. The acting is rather atrocious with Milla Jovovich simply doing a bad Angelina Jolie impression. The rest of the cast are feeble acting talents and that little girl is simply annoying. There are several attempts at jokes throughout the film but none really wash. The worst of them involve Zombie prostitutes. There is nothing scary about the film either. The first had a couple of chilling points but this film, is a wash with mild peril and no gore to speak of. When it comes to these kinds of sequels its always best to save the money and this movie doesn't change that point of fact.",2,2,5,17 March 2006
There's Something About Mary," Average comedy
","Gross out comedy is fast becoming one of Hollywoods biggest industrys. The American Pie films, South Park bigger Longer and Uncut and numerous Adam Sandler movies are among the biggest grossers and in 1998 There's Something about Mary became one of the genres biggest hits. The film opened to generally positive reviews from critics and audiences alike, as years went by the films popularity grew and since then by many has been regarded as one of the funniest films of all time. I don't share that opinion. The story is simple, a guy gets asked to the prom by a girl(called Mary) he fancys only for a rather unfortunate incident to occur which prevents him from saying goodbye to her as she moves to Miami shortly afterword. Years later and now a man he realises he is still in love with Mary and hires a sleazy private investigator to find her. However he to falls in love with her and soon becomes clear There's Something about Mary..... The film doesn't contain many subtle jokes, but as the genre suggests it shouldn't specilize in them so it would be unfair to complain about that. However the abundance of Toilet humour and sex related jokes does become waring after about an hour and half of the gags fall right on their face, in saying that there are some inspired moments but to few to warrent the praise the film has received. The performances have a certain charm but Stiller and Diaz in the leads aren't really convincing enough, you could argue Dillions Sleazy detective is the only person who raises an above average laugh count but there's no arguing about the fact he carries the movie at times. The film does have entertainment value and some ideas are good, but are rarely carried of to full potential. In the end There may be something special about Mary, but there's nothing special about this movie.",7,1,2,14 April 2006
Bruce Almighty," Enjoyable Carrey romp
","Bruce Almighty is exactly what you would expect from a Jim Carrey movie.Silly. It builds itself around Carrey and his arsenal of stupid expressions with the occasional laugh out loud joke and the occasional awful one. Carrey plays Bruce a news reporter who thinks God has a personal vendetta against him. However after all Bruces whining God, who is expertly played by Morgan Freeman has had enough. He grants Bruce all his powers for a period of time so Bruce can correct all the wrongs he 'thinks' are in the world. The supporting cast throughout the film is a mixed bag with Steve Carrell on awesome form as Bruces enemy at the work place, but Jennifer Aniston is not convincing as Bruces long time suffering girlfriend. As for Carrey himself well he plays the same role he always does, that of the flawed but lovable goon. He is effective but if Carrey isn't careful he will kill that character and that could seriously effect his future in the industry. The jokes keep a smile on your face and make the experience of watching the film enjoyable, but there just simply aren't enough gut busters in the script to keep this film long in your memory. To conclude Bruce Almighty is a decent film, but not one worthy of purchasing on DVD are making a sequel to.",7,0,1,2 April 2006
Jurassic Park," My favourite film
","Jurassic Park is simply my favourite movie ever. It has everything action, suspense, thrills and even a little romance thrown in for good measure. I first saw the movie at the age of 6 and was a big dinosaur fan so it obviously was very appealing but even then I could feel there was so much more to this movie than the great visual effects and mighty dinosaurs. No this was a movie with a message and one that since my first viewing I have always been thoughtful about. The issue in the film is cloning. I nstead of providing you with a plot synopsis I will just say watch the movie. There is no excuse not to. Some scenes worth a mention however are the road side attack in which a Tyrannosaurus Rex or T-Rex for short attacks a land Rover with two children in it. That scene was more scary than anything in the exorcist or some of the other horror rubbish that is spewed out today. The Raptors in the kitchen sequence is also nail biting stuff. Again the two kids are stalked around a kitchen by two man size dinosaurs that are very smart and very mean. The characters are a real love to hate batch of people with Jeff Goldblum putting in the performance of a very respectable career as mathamatician I an Malcolm. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are also good as the leads and two new comers Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzelo are good value as the unlucky grandchildren of the parks owner. All in All Jurassic Park is simply astounding in every way and could well be Speilburgs finest film.",10,1,2,11 March 2006
Dodgeball," 2004's funniest film
","Dodgeball is simply Ben Stiller operating at his peak. Sure he was good in There's something about Mary and Meet the Parents saw a good comic performance but Dodgeball is surely were his best role lies. The film tells the story of two competing gyms. One is run by a bunch of misfits and has serious financial difficulties. The other is a multi million outfit run by Stiller and his cronies. As the poor gym desperately trys to earn money the mega gym attempts to thwart it in every way until the poor gym come across the game of dodgeball. A championship is to be held this year and if the gym win they will have enough to continue their business. However the mega gym also enters in an attempt to put an end to their business once and for all. The cast are all awesome. Vince Vaughn is the likable hero and in Justin Long pain has never been so funny. Ben Stiller as I mentioned above is the star performance however and in many respects the man carries the movie. The film has good pacing even if certain comical scenes and jokes are stretched at times, plus the Dodgeball sequences themselves are very entertaining. The jokes do come thick and fast and 90% of them work perfectly. The other 10% do stick out a bit though. Some of these jokes also suffer from to much bad taste , such as the pizza down the pants sequence. All in all Dogeball is a great film for laughs and is certainly the funniest film 2004 offered us.",8,1,2,29 March 2006
The Island," One of 2005's most exciting movies.
","2005 has been a very good year for blockbusters. King Kong was superb in nearly every sense and War of the Worlds was also excellent. However The Island was another great blockbuster 2005 had to offer, but unlike the other two was overlooked and did poorly at the world wide box office. The story tells of two clones who are well played by Ewan Mc Gregor and Scarlett Johansson. They escape the facility in which they live and discover the real world. However Sean Bean who owns the cloning facility wants them back and sets out a batch of bounty hunters to bring them back. Like all Michael Bay films the films main attraction is large scale action sequences and here they can be found in abundance. It also should be mentioned that this is Bays best movie to date, and maybe his most exciting as well. The acting is very good by blockbuster standards and the dialouge isn't to bad either.The films big weakness is the lack of intelligence the story displays. Certain scenes make this so obvious that you yourself will feel stupid after watching them. To conclude the Island may not be the smartest flick of the year but its certainly a contender for most exciting.",7,1,1,28 March 2006
