The King's Speech," a king wastes time with a dumb speech thearpist
",It is a bad movie it has no action no computers just a regular king who has a stutter and relies on a speech thearpist to kill the stutter so when war comes he can save his country from Hitler and his armed men although it does have a good message about being loyal to your friends and family Spoiler ALERT the king eventually finds his voice. but this movie includes strong language and there is a lot of smoking including one scene where he uses the f word when he yells at the prime minister and characters hold guns but they are not used also there is a character who is shot offscreen but his body is later seen. but this an inspirational movie about stuttering and war and the king brings love to his family and other families in danger,Null,0,11,23 April 2011
