Hereditary," I also never want to watch this again
","Spoilers. Extremely unsettling. I went into the experience having never seen the trailer, only knowing of the hype which I feel this movie lived up to. I wasn't entirely disappointed by the ending, though I was hoping that this movie wouldn't have gone to the supernatural route and weighed more on mental illness as the driving force behind all that was happening. The music, cinematography and direction really amped the suspense/creepiness up for me. Excellent...but I don't want to think about it anymore.",8,0,1,23 September 2018
