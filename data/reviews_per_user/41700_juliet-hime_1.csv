Angels & Demons," more that I expected but less the twist unlike in the novel..
","I'm a huge fan of Dan Brown. Of all his books, Angels and Demons is the best and next will be Digital Fortress.The novel was well written, thrilling, full of twist and action. This is the novel that I couldn't pull down during classes.When I heard about the movie, I invited my family to watch it with me even though they don't like thrillers. We watched the movie a while ago at exactly 4:15 in ATC. Unlike Da Vinci Code, this was the best. You will experience a fast pace, puzzling adventure of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) together with Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) in solving the case of continuous murder of the preferiti by the white man Illuminatus with the twist of the personal story of the Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor).Although there are scenes that was removed or change in the movie. Maximilian Kohler did not appear in the movie not like in novel wherein he is was concern of the death of Leonardo Vetra and he was the one who called Robert Langdon in the book. Also in the book, Vittoria Vetra explained to Langdon how the Rome will be destroyed by demonstrating with the little antimatter. The Hassassin depicted as a tall and black man unlike in the movie which was a white man. In the movie, it did not explained that Camerlengo Patrick McKenna was the son of the late pope through a test tube that conclude to the last part, that was changed, when the survived preferiti was chosen as a pope and not Camerlengo Patrick McKenna. For me, the book shows more adventure for they must convince the Swiss Police that the preferiti will die in different churches by an Illuminatum and the destruction of Rome by a canister of antimatter.But on the top of it, the over-all cinematography was PERFECT! The Vatican City, CERN, Vatican Archives, the statues of the saints and catacombs.. It made me feel like I was in Rome or merely part of the scene.Over-all, I'll rate the movie 7/10 for a job well done and also made my family praised the novel I loved. I cannot wait for the Digital Fortress LOL!",7,2,6,16 May 2009
