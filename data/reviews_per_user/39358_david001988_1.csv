The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," i loved the movie
","this is my first review in IMDb what i really liked about The twilight saga : Breaking Dawn pt 1 is the action and suspense , the other twilight movies have NONE...... TO Mteuschler : you rated the movie 0/10 before watching it just because you think that the vampires should be like Dracula since you're a twilight hater you can't judge the movie it's called ' the stupidness ' when you hate something and then you came to rate it 0/10 without watching it . you're one of those clueless twilight hater , if you hated new moon then rate new moon 0/10 this is BREAKING DAWN , its really sad that you can't find the distinction between 'New moon' and 'Breaking Dawn'",10,28,90,10 November 2011
