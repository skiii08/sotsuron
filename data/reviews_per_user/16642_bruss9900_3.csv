Requiem for a Dream," Great piece of cinema
","Aronofsky's 'Requiem...' is a beautiful piece of filmmaking.  I was impressed by the camerawork of Matthew Libatique - his work is always strong (ie, Tigerland).  The solid performances of Burstyn, Leto, Connelly and Wayans (in a rare dramatic appearance) make these pathetic characters seem more real.  I know Ellen Burstyn was nominated for the Best Actess Oscar, but there should be an Academy Award category for Best Ensemble Cast.  This crew could have won hands down. This movie should be shown to all 7th graders across the nation in an effort to keep youngsters off of drugs. Liberal cry-baby parents would most certainly complain, but this film could be more effective at keeping kids off drugs than D.A.R.E. could ever hope to be.  The chilling score sets the mood for the what should go down in history as the one of the most brave pieces of filmmaking from the early 20th century.",9,0,1,12 August 2002
Fight Club," strong message, violent medium
","the graphic violence of this film might scare off some weak-stomached viewers, HOWEVER, fight club features some of the most provocative, intelligent dialogue of any film released in recent memory.  fight club gives the audience a thought provoking view of our modern world.  this movie was not what i expected - i expected only a bare-knuckle-boxing movie starring brad pitt.  what i got was much more.  edward norton is convincingly pathetic and his transformation from weakling in this film to menacing hulk in American History X, also released in 1998, is impressive. tyler durden's social commentary is right on with lines like 'the things you own end up owning you'.  if you can stomach some violence that is significantly harsh at times, and if you can look past some of the bull spewed from tyler's mouth, you will really enjoy this flick.  david fincher's best film as of yet.",9,0,1,12 August 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," morgan freeman on top of his game
","shawshank was one of the first videos i ever purchased.  this film has it all; great character development; poignant humor; heart-in-throat drama. this was the first time frank darabount directed a stephen king story - the second time was The Green Mile.  needless to say, the darabount-king hookup provides strong filmmaking for the theater-goer.a must see.",9,0,0,12 August 2002
