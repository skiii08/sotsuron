It," Amazing! 10/10
","OK, I don't usually leave reviews but I felt I had to with IT! This movie was (in my opinion) AMAZING!! This was everything I hoped it would be. I've seen WAY too many Stephen King book-to-movie adaptations and let's be honest, most of them are pretty poor! And it's not every often that a remake of a move is better than the original. But seriously, with this movie BOTH scenarios are true! This movie was absolutely superb! Great acting and great direction! Can't wait for Chapter 2!!",10,6,15,8 September 2017
