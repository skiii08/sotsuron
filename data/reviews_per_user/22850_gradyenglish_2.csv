The Ring," Not bad for a horror movie
","Compared to all movies, it was better than average.  But for a horror movie, it was MUCH better than average.  It all depends what you like.If you are a fan of the horror genre, I would go see it...if not, wait until video.  The theme was the standard 'evil never dies,' but it was done in a different way.  There are some things that go unexplained (like how Samara's thought's got on video in the first place)...I would have liked them explained, but, I am not sure it was crucial to the movie.I won't spoil the ending but I thought it would have been better if it has ended about 2 minutes earlier than it really did; I do have to say that the ending was much better than where I thought it was going to end while I was watching it.  I suppose that the ending made things all nice and neat and reinforced the theme of the movie (see above).Overall, the suspense level was very high and it was well directed and visually appealing.",7,0,0,23 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Thank god for the battle scene at the end.
","The thing that made the original series great was that, even though it was sci-fi, it was believable to a large extent.  Episode 2 (and Episode 1 for that matter) both throw the notion of believability out the window.  From about 5 minutes into the movie until about the last 1/2 hour was nothing but fluff; all cute little things put in by George Lucas to sell tickets....just tell the story.Because I am such a die-hard Star Wars fan, I still think it was worth the price of admission, but I would have much rather have seen Lucas return to tell the dark story that the Star Wars series really is.",6,0,0,28 May 2002
