The Blair Witch Project," Nothing more than a clever marketing exercise
","The Blair Witch Project can be considered a text-book example of 'forward-deployment' marketing, rather than a great film, which it is not. I may be blasted for saying this - but this movie wasn't scary. Not even a little, it wasn't even suspenceful. Proponents praise such things as 'creepiness', but I can think of numerous other films with better examples of this, notably 'Jacob's Ladder'. It was however a brilliant sell to the public, the genius in the marketing was in alluding that the story might be true. I'll admit that was what originally intrigued me. In this sense, we have all been 'had'. Perhaps those fans of the movie know this deep inside and are in denial, trying to validate their praise by looking for something deeper.",4,0,2,25 January 2003
Unbreakable," Unbearable
","Some of the comments here mentioned a slow-burning story... now there's an idea: burn the film slowly, or not so slowly, as the case may be... and speaking of slow things - how about that storyline? Up here in Canada we have glaciers that move more quickly. But that wouldn't matter so much if the story made any sense, lol, I don't know about you, but I'd have that kid committed if he contemplated shooting me to prove I'm a superhero. Actually, now that I think of it, the movie would have improved immeasurably if the kid had popped off a few rounds - that would have been cool, oh well...",Null,1,2,16 February 2003
Armageddon," I rate this movie a 9...
","... for the total collective intelligence of those who thought it was good. But then again, maybe we should all relax and enjoy it just for what it is (like some have commented here), send our brains on vacation and allow ourselves to be bombarded by the flashy, meaningless imagery similar to the way plants photosynthesize light. LOL - after all, basic concepts in Physics shouldn't apply to a movie involving space flight, right? Not to mention plausible human interraction or behavior. And Mr. Bay - justify your grossly inflated salary and do some research for God's sake!! Rohrschach Ink Blot tests are no longer considered valid for psychological assessments!!",Null,0,2,21 August 2002
Saw," Boring Spongiform Ensufferable-Plot-empty
","Okay, I'll give some credit: it wasn't that boring. But you could fly a fleet of Airbus A380s through the plot holes. Some of the reviewers here gave it a 'thumbs up' despite that, but I can't, because to do so would be to validate the insulting of the moviegoers intelligence. This is clearly a case of two dudes with a cool premise for a movie who just decided to make it up as they went along. It's like: what should we shoot next? Hey - wouldn't it be cool if it turned out that the one guy was actually a photographer hired to take pictures of the doctor. And then: we need one last twist at the end - the dead guy is the killer! Of course, anyone with advanced metastatic glioma in the frontal lobe should be able to lie death-like for hours on end. I like visuals as much as the next horror aficionado, but please, give me substance with it or at least make it unnecessary.",10,0,1,21 February 2005
The Sixth Sense," implausible ending - even for a movie
","SPOILER ALERT!! With all the hype surrounding this movie, naturally you are going to see it with high expectations. It's one thing to have  an ending which is 'surprise' because it was clever and the audience didn't think of it, but quite another when the 'surprise' is because the ending simply doesn't make any sense. The audience feels cheated in that case. I mean, come on... *SPOILER* - a year living with his wife as a dead person, and he doesn't make the connection until the end of the movie? All I can say is their sex life must have been non-existant. I realize that there is always some measure of 'suspension of disbelief' in films, but when the entire plot devise is centred on something illogical, it should not be forgiven.",Null,1,2,3 August 2002
V for Vendetta," This movie doesn't 'do' totalitarian very well...
","After watching this movie, I had to agree with an earlier posting which stated that this movie didn't really present a believable totalitarian regime. When the troops stormed in after the Benny Hill skit, I half expected the bloke to blurt: 'How dare you barge in here during tea!??!' You need to present a really dour, Machiavellian political atmosphere, where all sense of personal freedom is removed. Where the threat of brutalities is as horrifying as the brutalities themselves. Characters with muted personalities, indicating fearful oppression, but yet moments of humanity peeking through (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Handmaid's Tale, THX 1138) and the hero should begin like all the others, no different than they are, except for a courageous ability to rebel. For as long as there is even only one defiant character, the world is saved. There hasn't been a movie like that in a long time. Just look at what they did to the remake of 'Rollerball' - I'm afraid to see what they'll do to 'Logan's Run'.",6,9,17,6 October 2006
