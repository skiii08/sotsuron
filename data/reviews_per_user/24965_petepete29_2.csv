Insidious: Chapter 2," 7.2 rating .. Bull Sh*t
","bad movie.Paid 25 dollars plus popcorn and drinks for my girlfriend and I at the cinema for a t.v. movie that we wouldn't watch on t.v.story didn't make sense.B grade actors,C grade effects,I actually laughed out loud when I saw the first appearance of a so called ghost .. looks like it was done and written by kids! at 7.2 this should be one of the best movies out there !!! I think IMDb has been infiltrated and taken over by movie makers, and that's why we keep seeing False high ratings.I've seen other crap movies with a very high review .. so bye bye bullsh*t IMDb.We don't trust IMDb anymore, and we are warning everyone we know, and to pass on the warning to others.We have to give a phone number or credit card number just to post a comment on a movie .. WTF!!!",1,16,35,27 September 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spiderman meets Twilight !
","I have never written a review before until I saw the new Spiderman movie,they turned Spiderman into a chick flick and it smells a lot like Twilight.The father of the girl is a cop in both movies with the yes no yes no scenario that never stops just like in Twilight.It looks like an expensive B movie.Some parts don't even make sense: how did GodZilla find a blanket in the sewer and when Spiderman got shot in the leg and limped in pain but at the end was totally fine. If you like Twilight and Jack & Jill .. you will like this movie I think it got 7.6 stars because young 10 to 16 year old girls.If it's not broken,don't fix it.",1,7,23,24 July 2012
