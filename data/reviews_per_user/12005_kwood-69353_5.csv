Bohemian Rhapsody," Excellent performance
",Loved rami malek's performance and the music was brilliant as expected. I found The formula of the film itself like any other biopic. An enjoyable movie though.,8,1,1,25 March 2019
Straight Outta Compton," A hip hop classic
","The way i see it is, you don't have to be a fan of hip hop to enjoy this film, even though i am. But seriously i can't fault this film in any way. the acting is brilliant and the structure and pacing made sure it doesn't drag or get boring in any way. And of course the music speaks for itself. I could be considered bias because of my love of 90s hip hop, but i strongly believe this is a top movie in its own right. 10/10 for me.",10,1,2,27 March 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Beautiful mayhem
","One of the biggest surprises of the 2010's for me was this film. Yeah i enjoyed the original mad max films, but they never stuck with me like some other action flicks from the 70's & 80's. But this is a different story, aesthetically this film is stunning, the action scenes feel gritty and tence and the music is masterful (especially brothers in arms) loved this film from start to finish and my pulse hasn't raced during an action film like this for years. Would reccomend to any action film junkie.",9,0,2,27 March 2019
