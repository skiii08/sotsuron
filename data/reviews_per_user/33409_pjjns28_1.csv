Despicable Me 2," Laughed until I couldn't breath!!!
","I was just looking for a place to post about this movie.... Passed it several times on pay-per-view thinking it couldn't be appealing to adults. Still not sure how I chose to watch it, but-- I AM SO GLAD I DID! I laughed so hard throughout the movie and especially at two scenes that involve a fake tube of lipstick. This move is great for the whole family. Action adventure is my usual genre, sometimes a break from the usual is a good thing, will be recommending it to all my friends who want to pause the blood and gore. It's cute, sweet, and totally funny. I may go back and see the first one now.PjJns",10,1,1,25 December 2013
