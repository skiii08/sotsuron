Blade Runner 2049," Great for the right audience, hard to watch for general audience
","It's hard to explain the effect of this movie, you gotta watch it to understand. The visuals, the scenes, every single movement, shadow or light - it's all put together in a way that I don't think I've seen in another movie. The feel to it is unlike anything else.With that being said, it's much slower than what most people are used to nowadays, so I'm sure 9 out of 10 viewers will find it boring. The story doesn't develop in a way that audiences have been taught the last few decades. It's a sequence that lacks the intensity of the 1982 movie, but adds deeper moments, a feeling of being in another place and time and a little bit of melancholy.The more time passes after seeing Blade Runner 2049, the more I think about it and the more I like it. It's a sequel that you should like if you liked the first movie, but if you're there just to watch an action sci-fi movie, then you'll be left disappointed and bored. The trailers for the movie are at fault for this, but they are looking to get as many people to watch it, so can't blame them.Overall - a great movie with a specific feeling to it. A visual masterpiece and a brave and deep work that will definitely remain in history.",10,7,16,16 October 2017
