Skyfall," Even failed as pure entertainment.
","I warn you from the start that my only goal here is a private one. This review is a practice in the art of film watching and certainly not a recommendation of any sorts.Movie's plot, its only asset, was a clichÃ©. And yet it was not a well-made one. The worst part about it was its credibility, so you couldn't help but feeling stupid several times during the film for watching it, such as Q's stupidity for connecting Silva's computer to their system, Silva's escape with bare hands, the unrealistic hacking ability of Silva, and worst of all the 'Home-Alone' scene to name a few.As for the actors, although some of them were brilliant, almost all of them shared a halo of artificial professionalism in the movie. It surely had some good elements, especially its music, but plot holes alone were enough to shatter the concentration of the viewer and kill the pleasant parts. Two other things that I enjoyed were the rat story and the visual effect of Silva's face.",3,3,6,4 July 2019
