The Lobster," Critics & snobs love films like this--audiences don't.
","That pretty well sums up my overall impression of this film, that I admittedly had high curiosity and hopes for.This is a film, like Pi, filled with many non-absorbent instances and images that culminates into nothing but stagnation, ultimately.Now, granted, one man's pretension is another man's secret identity. And I get what they were going for: They were hoping to make a dark comedy about the societal pressure to be mated, and the scarlet letter on anyone's back who is alone. That's clear in the first several short scenes. So, the film accomplished its goal before the 10 minute mark. From there, it limps to a black screen - no ending, no resolution, or even a hint at continuation. Just a feeling that they ran out of either film or ideas.This is a 'piece' about a man who checks into a resort for people who have come to their last hopes of finding a person to live their existences with. Sort of Howard's End-cum-Hotel California, in that no one can leave, and everyone only speaks once an hour in a monotone. The gist is that if they don't find a mate, they turn into a member of the animal kingdom. 'OK, not a bad idea, they could go somewhere with this...' I so naively think to myself after the first 4 minutes. And from there, we have the parade of statues: Characters introduced as fellow residents and meant to bring some humanity in the form of interaction. They forgot, however, to give them any substance. A nosebleed isn't a 'quirk', I'm sorry. If the actors had been directed to speak in more than one timbre, and had been written dialogue that didn't amount to a 'minutes of the meeting' memo, then maybe they could have had something.So, after some milling, the main 'character' tried to cuckold another 'character' and fails. So he leaves and finds himself embraced by another group with a separate set of standards and clothing that the group he just fled. And that about all as far as differences. The group has the same hollow, banal intonations as the people we were just tired of. And the same prattle happens all over again.This has the label of Dark Comedy. But, 'dark' does not mean colorless; and, sudden gasps at horrific snap-cut deaths & mutilations do not constitute laughter, which one expects from a comedy.As I said in the title, snobs will flock to this film because it gives them a perfect chance to say their favorite line: 'Well, you just didn't get it.' I just love hearing people say this. Why? Because it is usually said right after someone asks for their overall impression or opinion or reflections of what they just saw. I will never forget the time I saw a movie with some friend of a friend that was ... I think it might have been 'Pi'. I asked what he thought of that ending. He literally snapped his jaw up in the air and said, 'Well, if you didn't get it, I certainly won't be able to explain it to you.' I looked at him & said, 'You don't get it either, do you?' He laughed, but he didn't deny what I said. 'The Lobster' is going to be THAT kind of film, you just watch. So many people have already said the 7-paragraph equivalent of 'You just didn't get it' already on here. I may get some in reply.Well, you know what, my gentle 'parvenu-bies'? I got it. Everyone got it, and people who see it after this will get it.Art means something different to everyone who views it; that's why film is art. And I will not dismiss this as art simply because I'm of the opinion that 'The Lobster' is the cinematic equivalent of waiting for the nurse to guide you back into the waiting room after a routine checkup.Personally, if I wanted to watch an hour and a half of culminated silence peppered with 10 minutes of flaccid dialogue, I certainly wouldn't pay for that - I'd go to an empty theater before a movie starts. It would have been a more meaningful experience.",2,38,65,8 July 2016
Se7en," Haunting, gripping, sadistic--welcome to America (minor spoilers)
","First of all, I would like to make a few comments about some of the other comments on the movie: First of all, it was actually intentional that Brad Pitt seem somewhat cocky & ne'er-do-well in his role; the point of his character was that he most likely came from a smallish town's precinct where the hardest crime was probably stealing from the collection plate, and his attitude was looked up to. In a small town. He, in their minds, had the attitude of 'those movie & TV cops'. In L.A., an attitude doesn't even get you a latte. So his bravado is supposed to be misplaced. But what does come through is the fact that he honestly does want to do the right thing his own way, and 'get the bad guys & teach them some manners', usually with a lot of verbal & some physical abuse. Typical small-town, or rent-a-cop, mindset. Secondly, a lot of people claim that the gore was hard to take...WHAT gore? We only see the aftermath of the murders, not what they go through. And what they go through is only speculated upon, not hard-cold fact. The gore is in the mind of the audience. Frankly I am quite please that they took that approach, as it shows that the writers, producers, directors are giving the audience SOME credit for having minds & imaginations. Hollywood thinking their audience has a few brain cells--go figure... To sum up my feelings on the movie, I have to quote the artistic director, Rob Bottin, on this one--'This is a script that definitely gave me the butt-willies!' From beginning almost to the end, I was impressed by not only the idea, but the approach to such an idea. And a haunting thought occurred to me...why hasn't this ever been done before in real life? Or has it, but was not clued in to? Not that I'm hoping this is so, of course!! I think that given the circumstances, the victims were actually handled with dignity. So many times in movies, the victims are exploited because most of Hollywood thinks that we only want shock and after-death scandals. Here, there was no dirty laundry airing, no contrite bloodletting...just the sad fact that they were everyday people in everyday lives (whether we want to admit it or not), and chosen to fit a specific killer's agenda. Much like most other serial killers. Morgan Freeman, as usual, does no wrong, and brings a quiet grandness to his role (and every role). Brad Pitt, with the aforementioned background character, holds his own and does a pretty impressive job to get most of us to forget that he's known for his looks alone. Gwyneth Paltrow isn't given much to do, but she does it amiably. And R. Lee Ermey, as always, is a comic-relief treat (ring...'This is not even my desk!' slam!). Plus, how much fun was it for us to see 'Shaft' as the governor?? One minor flaw I feel compelled to say, and this is just my opinion: Not the actor portraying him, but the character of John Doe, left me a little dry. When he first arrived in the station, his character seemed to fit with all that was discovered in his apartment. But once he started talking, he fell into the same old Hollywood Killer mode. Giving away all of his motives and intentions and thought processes right before the end. This contriteness is in EVERY killer movie, and was a sore disappointment. For me. Personally, I would have preferred not to have him speak at all, or very minimally. Case in point, at the very end when Mills has the gun on him and Somerset rushes up after receiving the box. Doe goes into saying what his role is in the 7 deadly sins, and what Mills' role will be as well...Hasn't that been implied already?? We KNOW who will be what sin, just by the set-up! And there's only two left--I think we can tell who is which! Sorry, but Hollywood--take note, please - we don't need every killer's life story, motives, and intentions spoon-fed to us. Besides, with everything only being implied in the rest of the film, having John Doe go into such a self-serving diatribe really goes against the grain, and gives the feel of the film a 180 turn...which makes it all the more sad when the first hour & 45 minutes have proved that the writers, et al, have the intelligence to not stoop to that level. However that is my only beef with the film. The rest; above par, superb, magnificent, and a must-see...that you will be seeing in your conscious and subconscious for a long while after the film ends. Guaranteed.",8,0,0,2 March 2004
Glory," More Than My Words Could Praise, The History Glorifies Itself
","I find this one of my most difficult reviews to write. Even as I sit here for what must be the 206th viewing, I marvel, as acutely as I did in the very first viewing, that this tale has the compelling and overwhelming power to touch aesthetically, viscerally, profoundly and emotionally my sense of pride,injustice, soul. Even if this were not a true story, I would still recommend this movie to everyone with awe and reverence. And even as I watch, there is goose-flesh and damp eyes. As there always is...Based on the letters compiled and only two reference books (including 'One Gallant Rush' by Peter Burchard, which I proudly own), this tells the tale of the heretofore largely unknown 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first Afro-American regimen in American history during the Civil War. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw was a 26-year old bright eyed Bostonian who was chosen by favor to lead the 'first colored regimen' at the apex of the Civil War. Matthew Broderick portrays Col. Shaw as accurately as possible, bringing the youth and zeal of the real Shaw to grand light. He was truly overwhelmed by the thought of leading the troops, but idealistic and optimistic enough to give it everything he had and to make his family and title proud. Broderick never loses sight of the simple fact that Shaw was humble and grateful for every advancement he was given. Although in reality the 54th was compiled of mostly free black men from upper New England, Denzel Washington is cast as the runaway slave Trip who brings his grudges and injustices to the troop. He portrays a slave who is on a personal mission to hurt those who have hurt him (if you know about the history of slavery, one can hardly blame him), but in the process hurts himself all the more until by rote he learns to channel his hate into determination, and by his actions is humiliated and beaten down to the point that he can only rise up like a griffin and prove that he is as much a soldier as the rest of them. The 'whipping scene' in which you see him go through that exact process, every emotion known to a man culminating in a quiver of the cheek, a single tear escaping, and eyes that shred, plea, hate, mourn, haunt. That Denzel could convey that with a role that could have easily been a stereotype deserves more praise that I can type. Morgan Freeman is a man of quiet yet profound dignity that carries him in every role he plays, and this time as Rawlins is no exception. He is a victim of prejudice, but still carries his own as a man. He is there for his men as a leader even before being officially decorated, but he is not above reaching out to Shaw to help his men simply because Shaw is yet another white authority--he helps the cause, no matter the colors. And that cause is so much more than the War, which I will explain further below...The score by the wunderkind James Horner is Majesty in every literary definition of the word. I know that if I'm ever stressed and need a release, all I have to do is pop in a CD of this score, listen for only a few minutes, and I will be sobbing. In my humble opinion he has yet to top himself with his work in this picture. From the subtle ache of a single horn to the swelling of the Harlem Boys' Choir and their keening voices that beg us to remember forever.I won't break down the actors, directing or anything individually any more than I have because that's not the intention of this film. It's not a star vehicle, but rather hundreds of people coming together to tell a story they believe in. And as such, deserve to be praised as a whole, which only proves how well they've done their work. But some scenes cannot escape the psyche...The morning after they've been read a proclamation stating that they will be put to death, black and white, if caught bearing Union arms, and there they stand as a unit for roll call, not one man deserting, at attention for duty, prouder and taller than ever...The aforementioned Corporal Punishment scene (which, by the way, was the same punishment white officers would suffer if they deserted as well)...The charge on Fort Wagner--Shaw finally returning to the seashore he so loved all his life for what he knows in his heart is the last time, feeling home again and yet feeling already a walking spectre--Rawlins with a divine inner pride in his eyes marching toward the fort as Thomas looks to the others and Trip with no longer the mad lashing-out force to kill but the aggravated determination to win--the company as a whole marching into Fate with a gallant unified step...The true meaning of 'hero' is in the heart of a man who faces even death if it will prove himself a man, not only to others but to himself. This lies true for every person in that brave pioneering regimen, black and white. They didn't just die for their country or their rights, but for their own personal honors and faiths as human beings who are deserved of dignity. The likes of which this country will never see again, but must not fall into obscurity. At the heart, and in my heart, this is not a story of men, but what it means to be a man. And the sacrifice it sometimes takes to become one and prove yourself one. We as a Nation, as Earth, should thank the 54th for that beautiful lesson. This pristine film will guarantee it so.",10,25,31,28 January 2006
Midsommar," 'Midsommar' translates to 'Missing Some Air' - some fresh air, that is.
","Too much time, too little everything else.This is 'Wicker Man', down to the maypole. There is a small difference in that the main character is broken into 4 stereotypes, but beyond that it is a script already written, several times over.I can see in several instances how this writer/director was trying for the horror genre, though, with three distinctive horror cliches. But, the fact that an audience can recognize these attempts says something in and of itself. Add to this, that each attempt made in this film failed.Dig, if you will, mes amis:First; the filmmakers gave us the aforementioned teen stereotypes that have become trope. However, the original concept behind having a group of characters in peril, that this horror trope has butchered for the last 40 years, is that one has to have LIKABLE characters. Whereas, too many modern horror films (this one included) are filled with people you're sick of after an hour and wish would either die or suffer. Sometimes, within the first 5 minutes, but I digress...Second; to the filmmakers' credit, they didn't pile on the jump-scares but opted for the long, drawn out scenes leading to something 'horrible'. This is refreshing. In theory. However, for these long scenes to be suspenseful, you have to not be able to tell what's coming. Such as in 'The Exorcist' - what was going to be behind Regan's door after that long dolly down the hallway? In this film, we knew what was going to happen EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. So, the drawing out of such scenes bordered on either excruciation, nappy time, or a chance to show off your riffing skills, depending on your nature. Without spoiling anything, one famous scene prompted my audience to begin a chant of 'Go 'SPLAT'!!'(OK, I hear some people saying, 'Oh yea? Well, there were long pans in 'Halloween', but we knew there'd be a killing. So there!' True. But, did you know when? Or how? Or who would be first, or next? Not the first time you saw it, and this proves the point. Suspense needs mystery. And again, in this film, there was 0% mystery to anything that occurred. Just loooooooooooooong build-ups to the predictable.)And third; the damned last-minute-twist moment. Which is by now so old hat that we've almost stopped noticing. It's just accepted. There was absolutely no reason for it, nothing to hint at this, nor was it in the character's nature whatsoever - the opposite would have been true to her character. As it was in the film, it was just a desperate tack-on.(OK, I hear you again - yes, the unexpected can be jarring and effective. But, only if you can believe it. With this last shot, I didn't buy it one bit. She had been acting the polar opposite for almost 3 hours, up to 2 minutes prior to the last shot. What happened in those two minutes - did the elderberries & oat straw finally kick in or something??)The Directors Cut of this film is three hours.The theatrical cut is 2 1/2 hours.The original content is 35 seconds.See the original 'Wicker Man' instead.",3,2,5,24 February 2020
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Hey, If You're Gonna Go Goth...
","...you might as well go all the way. In terms of production, camera work, score, and everything-but-the-kitchen-sink scene work, Donald Trump only wishes he were as rich as this film. Taken on that production level, it is almost reminiscent of a weekend with Jim Morrison in terms of excess. But somehow, this overly-sumptuousness works for such a tale as this. And yes, I do agree that in the terms of the original story, this telling is more faithful that the host of other movies made over the decades. If you have not read the original, I highly recommend it, but save it for Samhain :)Individual notes: Some of the casting in this is positively inspiring, especially Tom Waits as Renfield who was superb. Of course, the ubiquitous Gary Oldman as the Count was a casting inevitability, and he did not disappoint--pulling out so much that he gave new height to The Hilt that most actors aspire to! Boy, if ever there were a candidate for a remake of The 7 Faces Of Dr. Lao...And Sir Anthony Hopkins (slight pause for a reverent bow) captures the exact mood of the entire production in this film--bold, bawdy, lush, wicked and witty. There must have been some secret delight for him to go from the vampiric doctor in 'Lambs' to the vampire-eradicator in this film. What other actor could find so much with so little? Now, the bad notes...I know that Winona Ryder was very keen on doing this film and tried her best, but she tried TOO hard, and it showed. Her accent was almost a caricature of the true British tongue, and she almost sounded like Carol Burnett imitating the Queen on her variety show. One reader commented on and questioned her gasping through the film; it could have been an attempt to look shy and easily frightened, but I'm going to chalk it up to an overly-tight corset. And where Ms. Ryder over-did her part, Mr. Reeves UNDER-did his. I, too, kept waiting for a 'dude' to slip into his speeches. And his pronunciation of certain words had my friends and I giggling hysterically. Which is a shame, because in the book, the part of Jonathon Harker is a major and pivotal role...though not in this film, and I can't help but suspect that the fact that Harker was played by Reeves might be the reason that the Harker character was pared down dramatically from the book for this movie. But, because of the lavishness of the rest of the material, we don't miss it much. And rightly so, for this is not supposed to be a true remake of the book, but rather an experience. The true Victorian feel of the book gives way to the lustiness that would never have been expressed by Stoker (maybe not even realized...??). Why do we feel such sexual magnetism about the legend of the Count? There is something very sensuous about someone entering your mind and exerting intellectual will over yours. This was never more evident than in 'Lambs', and in this modern version of Dracula. Also, I think what makes Dracula more appealing, particularly to females, is the way he exacts what he needs. Other fabled 'monsters' merely slash, chop, dice, shoot, etc. There is no contact with the victim. But with Dracula, he supersedes the will of the victim by engulfing their will with his, he moves in close over them, draws from them in a 'kiss of life/death'...but does not kill the women. Instead he makes them his wives. And immortals. So not only does such a character appeal to some secret side of a woman's sexuality, but also feeds the human desire to live forever. That, to me, is why the Count survives as still the most feared, yet feared not, of all the movie 'monsters'. And these facts are what this movie captures - the written fable, the primal desire AND the imagined legend. So to sum up...Goth doesn't get better than this. Be prepared to laugh and lust. Give your will over to the bawdiness, and enjoy--it really is a carnival ride of a film.",7,1,2,12 May 2004
The Green Mile," When Story Was King
","The most frequent word I have read in all the comments about this movie confirm for me both why I adore this film and why others do as well, because that one word is something sorely lacking in most movies of today - The Story. Truly, how many movies in the last 10 years can you honestly say that the story, the tale, is what took you away from the theater? That the tale from someone's imagination both shed light on your own problems in life and transcended you above them? Also, how many original stories are for adults these days and not from Pixar? I don't say that as a knock against Pixar at all, mind you - they are terrific films. But, they are purely CGI, which is what most 'adult films' are, too. How often have you come out of a theater and said, 'Whoa, did you dig those effects?' All too often, I think. But it's rare that one can see a film these days and say, 'Wow, what a story!' Indeed, The Green mile, is one of those.It is, and yet it isn't, a surprise, also, that the most prolific storyteller of our time has been the ubiquitous Stephen King. Yes, he has scared the daylights out of us. But, he has also made us laugh, made us cry, made us doubt (Misery), made us wonder (The Stand), made us reminisce (The Body/Stand By Me), made us hope (Shawshank Redemption), and above all made us imagine. At this point, I don't think it's accurate to call him a horror writer, because he has proved himself beyond that. He weaves his tales so effortlessly that we go along for every ride he takes us on. As one of the stars in The Green Mile has said, he's just the best storyteller around the campfire - at least in modern times. He often leaves the reader wondering, 'How does he come up with this stuff?' But above all, it is in the way he tells it. His people are real people dealing with cleverly-disguised-as-unreal situations, and that's why we are drawn to his tales because we can see ourselves and ask ourselves what we would do when faced with the demons we face in life - real or imagined.This brings us to the story of The Green Mile. On the surface, a fanciful and heart-wrenching tale. But in its telling, it becomes a several tales woven into one tapestry that we all can identify with. Haven't we all had a co-worker who makes our skin crawl and our blood boil but that is so connected we can do nothing about? Haven't we all felt at times so isolated and alone in this big world that we pour our love and care into the first creature that will come along into our 'cell'? Haven't we all felt so uninformed and jumbled that we have a hard time accepting pure and innocent love given without recompense? Haven't we all felt so helpless and broken when we know what the right thing is to do, but we are powerless to stop the wrong from happening? Haven't we all felt hesitant at first to accept the miracle of human kindness? And when that kindness is gone, then why are we still here?Haven't we all felt at times that maybe our travels have gone on just a little too long, to the point when we wonder briefly just why we're still here? I cannot mention one actor in particular without mentioning them all, so I will refer you to this movie's cast list so that you can appreciate just what a true ensemble this is - no one 'star' shines in this film. Everyone shines their own light. The music by Thomas Newman is nothing short of perfection, and deserved a special mention for its completeness in emotion and symbolism, as well as lifting the listener to even higher highs above the story itself (as an aside, and with all due respect, I feel that this score deserved the Oscar for 1999).This could be coupled with 'Shawshank' as a prime example of cinematic-yet-human storytelling at its finest. And, they are both directed by the same director, Frank Darabont, who seems to understand what grand and caring film-making used to be, and deserves to be again. He sees the beauty in the simple, the humanity in the unbelievable, and he is able to pull off the sadly rare feat of crediting his audience, without resorting to trends or porn or language or lots of blood & booms. He gets it. Plain & simple, he gets it.Yes, we are all fans of great special effects. We're wowed by big explosions and digitally-enhanced boobs and butts. And, OK, we laugh at naked wrestling men, or stoned losers, or drunk geeks, or anything easily accessible to the masses. Sure, films can appeal to the common denominator - this is evidenced by the string of movies that have their two weeks in the sun, every single two weeks, until another one comes out. But, do we still remember 'Superbad' with the same awe and emotion as we do 'The Green Mile', or 'Shawshank'? The same way we remember 'Casablanca' or 'Citizen Kane'? It's easy to give an audience a momentary guffaw or gross-out moment. But, it's rare these days that a film will stir within our hearts and psyches even years after we've seen them. It's rare that a story so original and unexpected can both bring us back to our fundamental selves while sweeping us away. And, just like within The Green Mile itself, it is rare that someone or something comes along who knocks us off our carefully constructed foundation.But, thank the heavens when they do...",10,1,3,17 January 2009
300," We, Who Are About To Be Digitally Enhanced, Salute You!!
","Hands down, this was the most sublime, contrite comedy of the year! I shall comment specifically on the finer aspects of this slice o' celluloid:On Leading Actor: George Clooney doing a bad Sean Connery impression. Sorry, George--I didn't know 2006 was such a lean year for you...On Entrances Of Fighting Animals: Ladies and gentlemen, Elton John! Queen! Miss Piggy! Did anyone notify Michael Jackson that some of his parade pets had escaped NeverLand? The only two missing were Kodos & Kang from the Simpsons...In face this reminded me of Bart & Milhouse trying to do their own Gladiator remake, intercut with clips from the Village Peoples' secret stash (probably snuck in there by Rod & Tod Flanders): 'OK, wheat! We need more wheat! OK, battles, some kind of speech about freedom, more blood, beheading, 'nother speech about freedom, limbs flying, push the bodies, 'nother speech about freedom...'Wait, Bart, are we doing Gladiator or Braveheart?' 'Oh man, I think we're sitting too close to this bucket of Mr Clean suds....Hey--Mr Clean! Yea! Put him in there, too!'On The Villain: We can all rest easier now, because this 'film' has heralded the triumphant comeback of RuPaul!! Pierced, pumped, and sassy!! If you doubt that it was truly he/she, just think about his/her most spoken line - 'Kneal before me!' Think about it...On second thought--don't.On Token Judas Character: The bastard son of Gollum and John Merrick. And when it was led into the harem of wanton, randomly-pierced, rejected LA Lakers cheerleaders, even Caligula might have just said, 'You know what, I'm outta here, pal'.On The 'Fierce Persian Army': (Cue b-sharp) We represent the Screen Actor's Guild The Screen Actor's Guild, The Screen Actor's Guild And in the name of The Screen Actor's Guiiiiiiiiiiild, We wish to welcome you to short-term contracts!On Soundtrack: Nice to know Survivor's still getting work.Now, some of you may be asking, 'Well, what of the story? The characters? The plot lines? (Pause for 8 minutes of uncontrollable snickering)...OK, seriously, back to it now...(hee hee)Yes, I'm having fun writing this. And that brings up a very good point: Movies are meant to be fun! To be enjoyed--to entertain! So, in that sense, it served its purpose very well. True, my enjoyment may not be the kind the makers had in mind, but it gave me some great laughs, which are always welcome in my life; so I can't knock it too hard. Besides, those of you who know me how much a kick I get out of laughably bad cinema (oh, I do love them - ever so much!!).Don't expect anything of substance, and you will have a great time watching this. And remember the immortal cry:They make take our lives, but they'll never take our Ab-Rollers!!!",10,2,4,22 May 2008
