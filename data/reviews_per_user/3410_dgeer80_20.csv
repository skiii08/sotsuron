Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Twenty years from now...
","...how will the next generation of Star Wars fans look at TPM, as well as the prequels?Since 20 years have passed since Episode 1 was made in this scenario, and the prequels have been established for years as part of the Star Wars saga, would THESE fans complain about the same things people do today about TPM? I don't think so.To me, by that time, the prequels will BE what Star Wars is to THAT generation of fans, and the backlash that exists now about TPM won't exist because Episode 1 will be what Star Wars is to them and what they grew up with, as well as the other five episodes. It will be excepted as having 'the star wars feel,' and so will the rest.For us, 16 years went by, and all that 'Star Wars' was to us was the OT. And now we have three new movies being made that cannot possibly mean what the OT means to us since the OT is a part of what we grew up with. Now that we're adults, TPM won't be looked at by most people who grew up with the OT as what Star Wars is and that it's as good as the OT(except for the few of us who look at it the way that I'm talking about in this scenario). The music is totally new to what we've become accustomed to as far as what we think of as being Star Wars music. The characters aren't who we've come to know and love for the most part, and it takes place at completely different locations.But just think that when 20 years pass, the next generation of Star Wars fans WILL except these 6 movies as what Star Wars is since they'll see how it all flows smoothly together. Everything from the music, to the characters and their stories.I just find the remark 'It (TPM) just didn't feel like Star Wars to me,' a stupid reason to complain about TPM. 20 years from now, this WILL be what Star Wars is to the next breed of Star Wars fans. It'll be what they grew up with and have come to know and love, just like the OT was to us. And just as we had new Star Wars movies made that got beef from a lot of fans, so would any other new Star Wars movie made 20 years from now.With TPM, the acting is no better nor worse than the Old Trilogy.  The lines are no more cheesier('I don't know where you get your delusions, laserbrain' etc.).  The plot is actually more complex than the OT and just as deep if you actually understand the plot.Star Wars hasn't changed.  You have.  For most every person that I've talked to that saw the OT as adults thought that The Phantom Menace was brilliant and imaginative.  If other people in this category didn't, fine.  But most of the bashers of this movie were kids when the OT was out, and they grew up with it.  It's a part of their treasured childhood.  And now, they're adults, and they walk into the theater with an adult point of view when watching TPM, forgetting that their opinion on the OT is completely from their childhood.  One has to realize that when the OT came out, critics bombed those movies too.  Episodes II and III will get bombed by the critics as well.  Time needs to pass before these movies sink in as a treasured part of the saga like the OT is.Key:OT = Old Trilogy                                                       TPM The Phantom Menace",8,0,0,30 June 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What the heck are these people talking about?
","I'm not sure as to why The Phantom Menace has gotten so much negative feedback from people on this forum. Midichlorians? Jar Jar? Immaculate Conception of Anakin? Preposterous? While some people may find these things, as well as other minor things unacceptable in the Star Wars Universe, I beg to differ. Let me address some issues the best I can and tell TPM hatemongers why I think they ARE in fact acceptable in the Star Wars universe.1) Jar Jar Binks - Every Episode I review has something about Jar Jar in it, so here's my two sense(pun intended). Basically, people found Jar Jar to be annoying, stupid, a terrible addition to the Star Wars saga, etc. I agree that he's annoying and stupid, but not a terrible addition. Like I just said, I agree that he's annoying and stupid. But he's supposed to be. Haven't YOU met anyone like Jar Jar before? I certainly have. The personality of Jar Jar resides in most kids that I know. Kids can ALSO be annoying, stupid, clumsy, and get into trouble a lot. They're just like Jar Jar. But do we hate kids? Nope. We punish them for their actions sometimes, but we all get over it and love them for who they are. So no wonder kids can relate to him! Out of all of my kid cousins that live locally, they all liked Jar Jar. It's because they can relate. Jar Jar was supposed to have a child-like innocence to him. If you didn't catch that, watch the movie again.However, most people who are between the ages of 13 and 25 usually don't relate to him. I don't relate to him either. But yet, they like C-3P0. This has always puzzled me. But I think I've come to a sensible conclusion.Let's think about this a bit. 3P0 is annoying too. What about all those stupid statistics that he gave them, making the situations they were in much less hopeful? This makes everyone unhappy and 'annoyed' with him. Or what about the time he wandered away from the group, and got shot?! Chewy had to repair him and carry him around on his back for half of the movie! Such an 'annoying' inconvenience! And he was always whining about something. Now why don't people get annoyed by him? It's simply because they grew up with him, and he's apart of what started it all. He's nostalgic. Most people who complain about Jar Jar are the people who saw the trilogy as a kid. Guess what? When kids see 3P0, they see a cool robot. However, later on they see a whiny, annoying inconvenience. And yet, they still like him. Why? It's because he's apart of their treasured childhood. He's something they liked as a kid, and therefore they continue to like him, even though they realize the way he is. There's nothing wrong with this, it's just that these people don't realze that just as the kids of yesterday that grew up with 3P0 still like him despite his annoying antics, the kids of today that grow up liking Jar Jar will do the same thing for him.Lastly, Jar Jar served more of a purpose to this movie than 3P0 did to any of the movies. All 3P0 did was alert the gang of the Stormtroopers' presence(which was only because Chewy was in the process of repairing him when this blurb spirted out), and get the Ewoks to side with the good guys. Other then these two things, he did nothing but get in the way. Gee, doesn't this sound a lot like Jar Jar? Now, did Jar Jar not help the two separate societies on Naboo unite? Of course he did. Did he not become General of the Gungan army? Of course he did. So what if he's clumsy, annoying, and is always getting into trouble? These actions only help display why no one in the movie likes him, and why he was banished from Otoh Gunga(the underwater city). I mean, why would a society banish someone because they were clumsy? Because of all his stupid antics, I understood why.So what's the big deal? Jar Jar is just like little kids. Jar Jar is annoying like 3P0. It's just that the kids of yesterday still like 3P0 today because they grew up with him. He's 'nostalgic.' Without R2-D2, 3P0 is nothing. However, Jar Jar was able to unite two societies without the help of a cool sidekick, and despite his clumsiness. I'd say this, as well as the fact that he's just like little kids, makes him someone we should accept and respect. Treat Jar Jar just as you would a kid, and things will take a turn for the better. Treat Jar Jar as you would 3P0 and the same will happen.2) Midi-chlorians - What's the big deal? They take away from the mysticism of the force? I think not. They only emphasize the mysticism. They are sentient beings that reside within us. WITHIN our cells. Now this may sound scientific, and it may very well be. But guess what? The Force CREATES the midis. Life cannot exist without them, and they cannot exist without life. They are not the force. They don't create the force. We are only symbionts with them, lifeforms living together for mutual advantage. They only tell us the will of the force. So what if they work together with the force? The force is still the same mystical entity that we've all come to know and love. It's just that now we know where life comes from - at least this is what the Jedi believe at this moment in time. They have yet to explain why the midi-chlorians aren't mentioned in the original trilogy. Perhaps because trying to explain their faith with science made it no longer a faith. Maybe trying to define their religion with science is what aided in bringing about their ultimate demise. There faith could've in fact be weakened because of their scientific reasoning. Who knows? The next two episodes have yet to elaborate on this, and so we don't fully know the story behind the midi-chlorians.  And this is why people shouldn't criticize this concept.3) The immaculate conception - Ok, a lot of people were bothered by this. While I will agree that this is somewhat of a poor explanation of why Anakin is so powerful with the force, I don't think that it's a bad idea. We saw that when Anakin destroyed the Neimoidian ship, it looked like an accident. When in fact, this was the will of the force that he blew it up. The force used him(I'll get back to this later). So it could be that because he's the chosen one, things work out to his advantage because he obviously has to bring balance to the force eventually(by doing away with Emperor Palpatine in ROTJ). So up until that time, he has to stay alive. And since the force is seeking balance, it's going to keep its chosen one alive. This means that most everything will work to his advantage. So it could be that he'll realize this, developing a big ego trip that aids in his turn to the dark side. This won't be the only reason he turns, but it could definitely have something to do with it.Also, people think that because the force used him, rather than him using the force, made it less dramatic. I agree that it's less dramatic. But it's also an important element of how Luke goes the other way and he uses the force. It's something that his dad(Anakin) didn't have enough experience in. His dad just assumed that the force would work to his advantage, therefore not concentrating enough on using the force. Luke redeems what his father should have redeemed. This only helps explain even better why Anakin turns to the dark side. Plus, Anakin wouldn't know where the Neimoidians main reactor was to begin with.So I don't think him being immaculately conceived is a bad idea. Many people in today's society, as well as societies long before us, believed that Jesus was immaculately conceived. So if people can accept His conception as reality, why can't people accept Anakin's conception in a make-believe universe?4) The will of the force - Ok, people are asking, 'What the heck is up with this will of the force thing?' Let me tell you. Here's what I think. I think that the will of the force is ultimately good. It's seeking balance, right? Balance is good. Therefore the will of the force is good.But then, there's the dark side. So if there are two sides to the force, how can it have one will? It's because it's like the yin and the yang. It's an entity that's seeking balance, therefore it has one will. So why does the force allow the dark side to take over? Both sides are very powerful, but it's still seeking balance. It's for the same reason why God allows bad things to happen to good people. We don't quite know the answer, but Christians trust that it's God's will that it happened so that eventually things work out for the better in His eyes. One cannot fully comprehend something that's beyond our comprehension, like God for instance. So the same goes for the force. Don't try to fully comprehend something like this. That's ludicrous.So basically, I think that in the time of TPM, the force IS balanced. The good side and the dark side are both equally doing the same thing - coexisting. But then, the sith emerge, Palpatine becomes emperor and creates his evil empire, and the Jedi are pretty much eliminated. But then, by the end of ROTJ, Vader brings an end to the Emperor, turns back to the good side, and the empire is destroyed, bringing balance back to the force.5) How you become a Jedi - So we see from The Phantom Menace that the way you become a Jedi is if you have a high midi-chlorian count. People complain and complain about this, and yet it's totally plausible that this is really the only efficient way to have very young kids train to become Jedi.Let's play a little make-believe game. Imagine a kid of let's say 5 years old going up to his/her mom and asking, 'Mommy, can I go off to the Jedi temple on Coruscant and train to become a Jedi?' Do you really think that a parent would just let their kid leave the house at the age of 5 to train to become a Jedi Knight? Do you really think that a 5 year old kid is going to be able to make an intellegent decision about the rest of his/her life? I don't think so. But because of the midi-chlorians, Jedi can identify the kids as jedi-potentials, and the kids' parents wouldn't question it. They'll accept it as destiny.I know I know, George Lucas didn't have to write the story this way. But we already know that even Luke was too old at his age in the trilogy to train as a Jedi. So if HE was too old, then before TPM cam out, we can conclude that you still had to be pretty young to train. So if you had to be younger than Luke was(Luke wasn't old at all), then we can feel safe to conclude that one even as young as around 16 or 17 can't make such an important decision about his/her life intellegently. So the midi-chlorians make sense.'But then this indicates genetic superiority like the arian race.' No it doesn't. Think about it. What is genetics? It deals with DNA. The midi-chlorians are not DNA(life cannot exist without the midis, and the midis cannot exist without life), but are not the DNA itself. So yes, it's superiority, but not genetic superiority.  The midis are a blessing given by the Force to certain individuals. And the people of this galaxy far, far away accept this as inevitable. Only the people who are born to become Jedi are perhaps the only ones who really see this as something they'd want to do with their lives.It has always seemed to me that becoming a Jedi was all about destiny. If you take a look at all the movies, you can see that it was Luke's 'destiny' that he was to become a Jedi. And why would Yoda say 'There is another[hope for the alliance]?' It's because he already knew that Leia was a Jedi potential, or at least someone who has the potential to be strong enough with the force to be able to bring hope to the galaxy. How can one know this if midi-chlorians don't exist? It has been said that the force runs strong in the family of the Skywalkers. It can only run strong if it was the will of the force for it to make it so. And it all started with Anakin's immaculate conception by the midi-chlorians.6) The Plot - If anyone says that the plot was boring or stupid, they are only stupid themselves. If one doesn't realize that Senator Palpatine was the main character of this movie, then TPM went completely over their heads. Darth Sidious, Darth Maul's master, is the same person as Palpatine. Senator Palpatine is really the Sith Lord we see in the Old Trilogy who we all know as 'The Emperor.'  If you figure this out, then suddenly the plot becomes much more interesting. What is going on is that Palpatine eventually becomes the Emperor and creates an evil Empire by rising up in political power. He does so by deceit and manipulation. And what a better way of doing this then by playing both the good side and the bad like pawns in a chess game, setting each piece where he wants in order to eventually be elected Chancellor, which in turn will enable him to backstab the Jedi and the Republic however he pleases. He then will declare himself Emperor and develop the evil Empire that we see in full effect in the original trilogy.So why is this a dumb plot? I think it's done well. All along, it's Palpatine who's manipulating everything that's going on in the movie, and no one knows it. And because of his manipulations, he becomes elected chancellor by the end of the movie. In The Phantom Menace, the bad guy wins, and no one knows it. I think that's awesome. And this is a perfect set up for what's yet to come.Oh, and for that idiot who said the Trade Federation was the Phantom Menace, think again. Senator Palpatine a.k.a. Darth Sidious is The Phantom Menace. Just look at all that he's done in the shadows. He's the biggest menace of them all, with all his deceit and manipulation that went completely over peoples' heads. And Lucasfilm has confirmed that he's The Phantom Menace anyways. The title of this movie was named after the main character - Palpatine/Sidious(the future Emperor).7) Darth Maul - People thought that it was just stupid that he was only in the movie for like 10 minutes. I don't. He's a throw away character. Sure, Lucas could've written it some other way so that Maul had more screen time. But why is the way he wrote it a bad thing? I look at Maul as I do Boba Fett - a cool, but insignificant character. The fact that he got killed was only to stress the fact that the Sith work in pairs, and that because he's killed, Sidious will automatically search for another sith apprentice. In Episode II, he'll have another one, and then he/she will be killed as well. So gee, can you guess who'll finally become Palpatine's apprentice?Sure, Lucas could've written it so that Maul lasts through Episode II, and had more screen time in Episode I, but it's not necessary. It works just as well, if not better, the way Lucas has written it. And in the end, it stresses that Sidious/Palpatine really is the main villain.Conclusion -All in all, I think Lucas, and the people at Lucasfilm did a good job at making this beginning chapter of the Star Wars saga a good movie. I mean, when one opens a six chapter book, and reads the first chapter, and then reads the end, it makes the first chapter look dull. When people first saw the Old Trilogy, they were thrown into this galactic battle of a rebellion against a massive evil Empire. Everything is already established. However, with Episode I, these things haven't happened yet, therefore it makes it appear less exciting. But is any first chapter of a book more exciting than the climax(episodes IV-VI)? I don't think so.  Even so, The Phantom Menace still seemed as intriguing to me as any Old Trilogy movie.  It's just that it's the beginning, and so it's not just about good VS evil like the other ones, but HOW the good and evil came to be.  And THAT, to me was interesting. Episode I was only meant to set us up for the next two movies, and to introduce the characters. Nothing more.  And one should not expect anything more than that when watching this movie.As for the things like the special effects, the acting, etc., it's merely subjective. In fact, the whole subject of whether or not TPM was a good Star Wars movie depends on the individual. It's just that some things such as the things I listed above, are inexcusable. The people who have a problem with the 7 things I listed above just have a serious problem with themselves.No, I'm not a Lucas or Star Wars gusher. I merely think that in this case, Lucas did a good job with the introduction to the biggest Sci-fi saga of all time.",8,0,1,18 April 2001

And what a better way of doing this then by playing both the good side and the bad like pawns in a chess game, setting each piece where he wants in order to eventually be elected Chancellor, which in turn will enable him to backstab the Jedi and the Republic however he pleases.  He then will declare himself Emperor and develop the evil Empire that we see in full effect in the original trilogy.So why is this a dumb plot?  I think it's done well.  All along, it's Palpatine who's manipulating everything that's going on in the movie, and no one knows it.  And because of his manipulations, he becomes elected chancellor by the end of the movie.  In The Phantom Menace, the bad guy wins, and no one knows it.  I think that's awesome.  And this is a perfect set up for what's yet to come.Oh, and for that idiot who said the Trade Federation was the Phantom Menace, think again.  Senator Palpatine a.k.a. Darth Sidious is The Phantom Menace. Just look at all that he's done in the shadows.  He's the biggest menace of them all, with all his deceit and manipulation that went completely over peoples' heads.  And Lucasfilm has confirmed that he's The Phantom Menace anyways.  The title of this movie was named after the main character - Palpatine/Sidious.7)  Darth Maul - People thought that it was just stupid that he was only in the movie for like 10 minutes.  I don't.  He's a throw away character. Sure, Lucas could've written it some other way so that Maul had more screen time.  But why is the way he wrote it a bad thing?  I look at Maul as I do Boba Fett - a cool, but insignificant character.  The fact that he got killed was only to stress the fact that the Sith work in pairs, and that because he's killed, Sidious will automatically search for another sith apprentice.  In Episode II, he'll have another one, and then he/she will be killed as well.  So gee, can you guess who'll finally become Palpatine's apprentice?Sure, Lucas could've written it so that Maul lasts through Episode II, and had more screen time in Episode I, but it's not necessary.  It works just as well, if not better, the way Lucas has written it.  And in the end, it stresses that Sidious/Palpatine really is the main villain.Conclusion -All in all, I think Lucas, and the people at Lucasfilm did a good job at making this beginning chapter of the Star Wars saga a good movie.  I mean, when one opens a six chapter book, and reads the first chapter, and then reads the end, it makes the first chapter look dull.  When people first saw the OT, they were thrown into this galactic battle of a rebellion against a massive evil Empire.  Everything is already established.  However, with Episode I, these things haven't happened yet, therefore it makes it less exciting.  But is any first chapter of a book more exciting than the climax(episodes IV-VI)?  I don't think so.  Episode I was only meant to set us up for the next two movies, and to introduce the characters.  Nothing more.As for the things like the special effects, the acting, etc., it's merely subjective.  In fact, the whole subject of whether or not TPM was a good Star Wars movie depends on the individual.  It's just that some things such as the things I listed above, are inexcusable.  The people who have a problem with the 7 things I listed above just have a serious problem.
No, I'm not a Lucas or Star Wars gusher.  I merely think that in this case, Lucas did a good job with the introduction to the biggest Sci-fi saga of all time.",8,0,1,18 February 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," One of the best Star Wars movies ever!
","(SPOILER WARNING)I just have to say that this movie exceeded all of my expectations for it. It captures the heart, fun, and adventure of A New Hope, and combines it with the darkness of The Empire Strikes back. Attack of the Clones is just as good (if not better) than these two movies. One word: Awesome.I was surprised with the acting. Usually Star Wars gives us corny dialogue and acting, but this time around it was better. Still cheesy and not the best dialogue ever, but definitely better. Hayden Christensen was great as Anakin. You could see the dark side swelling within him. He's convincing that he's going to become the evil Darth Vader. Ewan McGregor gives Obi-Wan clever, fun, witty, and wise personality. You can see Alec Guiness in him. Christopher Lee was awesome as Count Dooku. He played the kind of bad guy you love to hate. Those are always the best. Ian McDiarmid is great as Palpatine/Sidious, and the rest of the cast does well also.Jar Jar is in this movie much less (5 minutes). And I have to say that he's actually more tolerable that 3P0 in this one. The story was very engaging. It not only has the qualities I mentioned above in the first paragraph, but it also has mystery as well. I was very intrigued by this aspect of the movie.The action was incredible. And Yoda was the star of the show. We finally get to see why he's the most powerful Jedi. I was in awe of his action sequence. The coruscant chase was great. The rain battle was great. The asteroid field chase - great. Arena battle - amazing. Clone War - magnificent.There were also some extremely great Old Trilogy tie-ins that just make you ache to see the next movie RIGHT NOW! You really see things moving into what we all know will happen in the future (or is it the past?) :)There are so many more things to love about this movie, but overall, this movie is a 9 out of 10. Not perfect, but pretty darn close! Go see this as many times as you can!",7,0,0,17 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," My favorite Star Wars movie
","Yes, you read right. Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is my most favorite Star Wars movie to date. Now, I'm not saying it's THE best one made. Just my favorite. But I do think it's on par with A New Hope, and The Empire Strikes Back.Anyhow, this movie is filled with excitement from start until finish. The Phantom Menace spent an entire two hours setting us up for this exhilarating second chapter in the saga. TPM's set up and complicated plot details(very important details for the rest of the saga) pay off here in AOTC.But this movie really surprised me. I thought the characters were entertaining, the action and special effects were wonderful, and the story was so cool. After 25 years, we're beginning to see what the Clone Wars were all about. And we find out that it's all because of two Sith Lords that this whole war is emerging. It's all a combination of these two sith disguising themselves as two completely different individuals(Darth Tyranus = Count Dooku, Darth Sidious = Chancellor Palpatine) to manipulate politics in order to acheive their ultimate goal of destroying the Jedi and creating an evil Empire.This movie has such an awesome plot line. It's got action, drama, mystery, love, betrayal, deceit, and forshadowing all in one. We can see where things are going, in that the Republic will one day turn into the Empire, and that Anakin will one day become Darth Vader. It's so awesome to see all of this FINALLY unfold before our very eyes.The acting was typical of Star Wars type acting. People who say the acting was better in the Old Trilogy are just deceived and brain washed by their own beloved childhood, therefore receiving those movies as great no matter what because of nostalgia. I assure everyone that AOTC is more of the same cheesy dialogue. Same cheesy acting. It's just that people don't want anything to top Han, Luke, Leia, Chewy, etc. or to even be equal. They sometimes feel that these new movie are invading on what they THOUGHT they already knew about the saga. The saga was never completed. We only perceived what we thought might have happened, but never really knew. Now we're finding out, and that's a good thing. No changes are being made. Only elaborations.The story is better than ever for a Star Wars movie. So is the action and special effects. Obi-Wan and Dooku were great characters. I mean, all of the characters were cool, but Obi-Wan and Dooku stole the show - well, those two and Yoda. Any Star Wars fan that did not like Yoda fighting is not a fan. And this was by far the best scene in the movie.All in all, I give this movie 4 stars out of four as far as Star Wars movies go. It was great.",7,0,0,21 June 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," A very good conclusion to an amazing trilogy of films
","OK, let me first say that the first 'Matrix' film is a crowning achievement. It stands on its own, and can appeal to most mainstream audiences. Most anyone can understand the plot. But with 'Reloaded' and especially 'Revolutions,' even the most hardcore sci-fi fans who usually get these kinds of films walked out of the last two scratching their heads. When walking out of 'Reloaded,' they assumed that they'd get clearer answers in 'Revolutions,' so most people cut 'Reloaded' some slack (even though it's just as convoluted as 'Revolutions'). This is why 'Revolutions' is the most maligned Matrix film. The plots of the sequels was just too convoluted for mainstream audiences, and 'Revolutions' didn't offer the clear explanations audiences were looking for.They couldn't figure out why Neo had power outside the Matrix. Why could he stop Sentinels by thinking it? Why could he still see after being blinded by Bane, and see in a different way for that matter? The first film established how to get power within the Matrix, but that outside of the Matrix he was just another ordinary, but machine-engineered human being. So what was all this about?Why was Bane also Smith? How could Smith be in the real world in someone's body?How did Neo separate his mind from his body and end up at the Train Station place? What IS the Train Station?What was the deal with the family of programs at the Train Station who were smuggling their daughter out? What specifically was Sati all about? They sort of make a big deal of her, especially at the end.Why did the Oracle's appearance change (aside from the original actress dying before the third film was made)?How exactly was Smith destroyed in the end? How exactly was peace made between the Machines and Man? Why not just have a plot where they destroy the Matrix?What was the Merovingian (the French Man) all about? What was his purpose?What was Seraph all about?Zion was destroyed 5 times before without the Zion peoples' knowledge? How is that possible? Why did it occur? How and why were there 5 'Ones' before Neo?Getting the answers to these questions is imperative to enjoying the plot. And yet, the answers are very, very vague in the film. So because of that, most people just thought that the Wachowski Brothers copped out and made a special effects film that's all style and no substance.But the answers are there, and if one thinks about it, the film makes perfect sense. They just don't shove it all in your face like we're used to seeing with most films. So if one can actually grasp what the directors were trying to convey in the plot, for me anyway, becomes a much more enjoyable piece of cinema. I won't go into answering all the questions above, but if you check out www.thematrix101.com , you'll find mostly what is needed to enjoy the plot.Get over your first impression of the film if it was negative and check out that website for some answers. Perhaps if you understand the film, you might like it after all.",9,3,6,27 October 2004
The Village," A great film...if you're not looking for something scary.
","If you walk into this film thinking it's a thriller (which I don't blame anyone for except the people who marketed this film), you may just walk out disappointed. There aren't really that many scary things about this film. However, if you walk into it expecting quality drama, acting and storytelling, you might just find something likable about it.M. Night Shyalmalan (director of 'The Sixth Sense,' 'Unbreakable,' and 'Signs,') brings us an intriguing period piece about love, jealousy, and how far people are willing to go when driven by fear.An 'Amish' type community resides in an isolated village surrounded by a forest with a dark history. They fear 'those they do not speak of' who dwell in the woods, and dare not cross their path. But when a dire need of medicine from the towns beyond the woods emerges, one blind woman dares to face the dark in order to bring back the light.The film has an interesting (and creepy) atmosphere to it - a characteristic few movies these days are able to accomplish. One particular shot that comes to mind is between the two main characters, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) and the blind woman Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), when they're talking on the porch. It's a close-up profile shot of them talking, and in between their faces you see a gray fog covering the vast field in front of them - making the audience wonder what's out there watching them. It really symbolizes that not everything may be as it seems.The performances given by William Hurt(AI: Artificial Intelligence), Bryce Dallas Howard, and Joaquin Phoenix really make this film stand on firm ground. But perhaps the most interesting character is that of Noah Percy, played by Adrien Brody (The Pianist). He plays a mentally-challenged, and sometimes unstable man who happens to be in love with Ivy Walker. When he finds out that she's in love with Lucius Hunt, his unstable characteristics really start to take hold of him (as well as creep out the audience).If this were the first film from Shyamalan, it would be critically acclaimed. But since this is his fourth major film, and Shyamalan is now known for putting plot twists in his stories, people go into it immediately starting to second-guess everything they observe. So many people would probably figure out the twist long before the film ends because they're already looking for it. Either that, or they spend the whole film waiting in anticipation for it, only to be let down because they built it up to be the Second Coming. They remember how cool it was to discover what really happened to Bruce Willis' character in 'The Sixth Sense.' But they forget that, at that time, they had never seen a film quite like it before. They had no preconceived notions or expectations.As much as I enjoyed 'The Village,' I think Shyamalan should stop making films with plot twists for a while and just make some good movies with good stories. And he should not hype it up by advertising it as 'An M. Night Shyalmalan Film.' That name is now immediately connected with plot twists and thrillers whenever someone sees it. Otherwise, he may very well come to be known as 'M. Night Shyamalamadingdong.'",8,1,2,14 January 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Better than expected...
","...of course, my expectations were not that it was going to be better or even as good at T2. There was just no way that would happen. So I was expecting it to be as good as Demolition Man or something(which I thought was just ok).Turns out, T3 was way better than Demolition Man! And I personally thought it was as good as the first Terminator movie.We had awesome action sequences(especially the chase with the crane!), witty one-liners(which every Arnold movie MUST have!), and a decent plot that didn't seem as depressing as one would think it would be. Nick Stahl was great as John Conner. He's a better actor than Edward Furlong, although he doesn't look much like what Eddy looks like. Claire Daines' character was a good new character too. The T-X was the hottest robot I've ever seen, and she was one tough machine! But I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of her, and focused more on the plot of judgement day. And the twist of the T-800(Arnold) killing John Connor in the future, as well as judgement day actually happening sets us up for a great new kind of new Terminator movie for T4(if it gets made), because it could take place in a post-apocolyptic world with the human surviors battling against the machines. It wouldn't be the classic 'good terminator gets sent back in time to protect Connor/bad terminator gets sent back in time to kill Connorz' scenario. It could be taken to a whole other level because of the plot of T3!Good movie, great set up for T4![END SPOILER]",8,0,1,29 March 2004
Van Helsing," A fun ride, but flawed.
","Let me first say that I'm a huge fan of the old 1930's and 40's Universal monsters. My dad, who grew up on those films, introduced them to me when I was pretty young. Bela Lugosi's Dracula, Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster, and Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man were some of my favorites (along with the Invisible Man and The Mummy).So when I heard about Van Helsing, and saw the previews, I was excited. I knew Steve Sommers loved those old movies. And judging from what we got with his 'Mummy' flicks a few years back, I was expecting Van Helsing to be the same kind of film: An updated version of old monsters with a roller-coaster ride plot. Well that's what we got, but it wasn't as good as Sommer's Mummy films.First of all, their were some plot problems. There's a scene where Van Helsing's horse carriage with six horses pulling it along jumps a broken bridge over a huge ravine that they never would've made it over if actual laws of gravity were applied. It almost looked like the horses were flying like Santa's reindeer. It reminded me of when the bus jumped an incomplete highway in 'Speed.' Never would happen. OK, the carriage didn't quite make it over. It crashed onto the edge of the other side of the ravine. But neither the horses nor Van Helsing should've made it across. Not only that, but they were a decoy, so ANOTHER six horse carriage was behind them carrying the passengers they were trying to save, while Van Helsing was actually a diversion for possible vampires on the road. So they must have ALSO jumped the same impossible jump as Van Helsing did! And their carriage DID make it! Either that, or there was another complete bridge somewhere else. But even then, the timing would be near impossible for the real carriage to end up pretty much right behind Van Helsing's carriage to help him out.Second, Van Helsing gets bitten by a the Wolf Man, thus he has to become a werewolf himself during the next full moon at midnight. OK cool. However, a plot point that's never really established well is that supposedly the only way to kill Dracula (not vampires in general, but just Dracula) is by a werewolf killing him. This is something new in Vampire lore, since usually Dracula (as well as any other vampire) could be killed by driving a steak through his heart and chopping his head off, or by burning his coffin. So since in this movie it's established that the only way is by a werewolf, they need to tell us WHY. Whenever introducing a new plot point, it must be defined. If it was the usual steak through the heart thing, I'd buy it since that's been in Vampire lore forever. But alas, this is not the case. I can buy that Dracula has to be killed a different way than other vampires because he's the most powerful of them all. He gave his soul directly to the devil to make himself a vampire, whereas all others are just turned into one by being bitten by another vampire. But giving no explanation for a new method of killing him was a mistake.Another minor flaw was that when Dracula confronts Van Helsing for a duel, it conveniently turns midnight and the full moon comes into view. It would be fine if we were given more of a countdown during scenes. But the way the movie portrays it, it's by happy chance that it conveniently turns midnight just as Dracula confronts Van Helsing for a duel.Lastly, the CGI. Now, I'm a firm supporter of CGI, and I think it's a great tool. So it really takes a lot for me to actually criticize it. Steven Sommers tends to use CGI in unnecessary places. And in this movie, not only does he do that, but the CGI itself is rendered poorly. The Mr. Hyde character at the beginning suffered from what the 'Hulk' suffered from as a CGI character. It just looked fake and cartoony. I hate saying that, because a lot of CGI in films like Lord of the Rings, the Jurassic Park series and the Star Wars films look great and are very convincing. But in 'Van Helsing,' the Mr. Hyde character just didn't look real. His character was done better in 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' (which I thought was cool), because they used actual prosthetics and just blue screened him onto the frames with other characters to make him look huge. Much more convincing. This is the way he should've been done for Van Helsing. CGI should only be used when there's no other convincing way to do the effect one is trying to achieve. And if it's used, it should be given the same care that was given to Gollum in LOTR, the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, or the CGI aliens in the Star Wars films. Those creatures and effects were convincing. Hyde was not.Well, enough of the flaws. This movie was fun. The overall plot was cool. David Wenham's friar character was great comic relief. The CGI for the Wolf Man and the vampire effects was done pretty well. The atmosphere was very dark and moody. The Frankenstein monster was done right. He was the best character in the film. Thankfully, his character was created with prosthetic make-up. If he was done in CGI and only given the amount of care that was given to Mr. Hyde, he would've suffered the same fate of looking fake. Dracula's character was cool. I loved how him and his brides walked on the walls and the ceilings. He even had the romanian accent, which was a nice touch. I also like the ballroom scene. It's filled with people, and we see Dracula dancing with Anna Valerious amidst the crowd. There's a big mirror they look into while dancing, and she's the only one visible. Suddenly we realize that the room is filled with vampires since no one else casts a reflection! That was a nice touch. Lastly, I loved the opening scene with Dr. Frankenstein screaming 'It's alive, ALIVE!' That scene was filmed in black and white, and it even had the monster rushing up into a windmill with angry villagers with torches burning it down just like the old classics!So overall, I give this film a 6 out of 10. It was fun, but definitely flawed.",6,0,1,25 May 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Just as great as the first one
","I saw this movie yesterday, and already I've overheard one comment from the theater I was at, as well as a comment from a workmate, who said that they were disappointed with something(s) about this movie. Whether it'd be that it didn't follow the book EXACTLY, or it just wasn't as good as the first. I understand that it doesn't follow the book exactly, but I beg to differ as far as it not being as good as the first movie.Sure, it doesn't follow the book exactly. Neither did the last one. In fact, as far as I know, there were probably just as many differences from the book in this movie as there were in the last. For example, in the book of 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' Gandalf takes many years to get back to the Shire(wasn't it like 50 years?) before he tells Frodo to set off on his quest to destroy the One Ring. Also, the ENTIRE Tom Bombadil scene was cut from the movie - including the scene where they obtain the swords to kill the Nazgul where they meet the Barrow-wights (I assume that perhaps the swords that Aragorn gave the hobbits at Weathertop are the swords that kill the Nazgul, but I can't be certain). Also, dialogue was switched around from what it was in the book, like someone in the movie saying a line that was originally someone else's line in the book. Or the same person who said a line in the book says it in the movie but at a different point in the story(a.k.a. Gandalf's 'all we need to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us' speech and his story of Gollum; in the book it was at Bag End, but in the movie it was in Moria.) Also, we never see Gandalf talk to Radagast the Brown (another wizard). And, Boromir dies at the end of the movie, whereas he died at the beginning of the second book. Lastly, they never expanded on the fact that Merry and Pippin knew about the One Ring before they found out that Frodo had it, and also they never went to Farmer Maggot's house. And I know there were more changes.And what changes were made to 'The Two Towers' story in the movie? Faramir was meaner, they didn't go to Gondor, we don't see Saruman wandering the woods, Elves were at Helm's Deep, Wormtongue makes it to Isengard before the Ents flooded it, Arwen was in it, Eowen went with them, and certain things were pushed back until the third movie. There were a few more, but there were not many more changes than what was done in the first film. And that's not what gets me. What gets me is that people complain about these changes, and NONE of them were bad! The movie still worked very well!  It still stayed 90-95% true to the book(if you got that percentage on a term paper - that's an A grade my friends!). The only reason anyone would see these changes as bad is because <snobby, whiny & complaining voice>'It wasn't in the books!'</snobby, whiny & complaining voice>
Come on! This movie was fantastic! It's still very true to the book, Gollum was cool and funny, Gimli was hilarious, and the battles were so epic in scale it's not even funny. The Ents were just as I had pictured them - both character and visual-wise. The conflict with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum was perfect. Helm's Deep was terrific and very epic in scope. And the destruction of Isengard was just amazing. We really got a great picture.I think ultimately when one goes to a movie and comes out loving it, they will build up the sequels to such high expectations that they end up disappointed. Why not just expect the sequels to NOT be as good, since it's impossible to capture lightning in a bottle - and then come out not so disappointed?This movie was awesome. Just as great as the first one.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Good film, but overly crass
","I just saw this movie for the first time on DVD. As a whole, this movie has amazing cinematography and creativity. It's a cool homage to old spaghetti westerns, Japanese samurai, anime, etc. I borrowed it from a friend, but I can see myself owning it since I like those kinds of films with over the top violence. You can't take it too seriously, because it's not done realistically, and it's fake from the get-go. That's part of its charm.On the other hand, Quentin Tarantino tends to use overly crass subject matter and language just for the sake of being crass. Fans of Tarantino would probably say, 'What do you expect? It's Quentin Tarantino!' But I say, why is it needed? This movie was already good, and stuff like that doesn't enhance the plot. I don't mind movies that have some language and/or crass subject matter if it's done tastefully and at a bare minimum. But the way Tarantino does it is just jarring. It stops the movie and prevents the plot from moving forward when it should. There's just too much language at times(and it's always the worst words used), and that scene with the two guys either raping or wanting to rape Black Mamba while she was in a coma is just sick. Granted, they didn't show anything (thank God), but their choice of words during that dialog that went on between them was just unsettling and it's something I'd rather not hear about. The subject is crass on its own, so it didn't even need that 5 minute bit of dialog with them talking about it. I have yet to find a good reason for that scene to even be there. It didn't enhance the plot at all. I'm absolutely positive that this scene, as well as most of the language could've been omitted and the film would've still be great(probably better). Scenes like this, and over the top bad language insult my intelligence. The movie is perfectly fine without all that. Sorry if I have morals (actually, I'm not sorry), but some things are just better left out.Thankfully, most of the crude language and subject matter was gone after that, and we got a magnificent blood bath of a movie with excellent choreograpy for the fight scenes, wonderful cinematography, and fun homages to Japanese samurai movies, anime, spaghetti westerns, etc. The plot was clever and witty when the movie actually focused on the plot.My Rating: 8/10",Null,0,1,4 June 2004
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A surprising hit!
","Boy, was I ever wrong when I first judged what little I saw of Johnny Depp's (Pirates of the Caribbean, Finding Neverland) portrayal of Willy Wonka in the previews for this film. Even though it was different from Gene Wilder's portrayal in the 1971 version (titled Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory), Depp ends up giving one of the most enjoyable and funny performances of his career. Because of director Tim Burton's (Sleepy Hollow, Big Fish) outstanding reputation in working with Depp, it allowed for Depp to be able to deliver a gratifying spin on Wonka's character that truly captivates the audience. Add to that the fact that it stays much closer to the book by Roald Dahl, and you've got something that'll last forever.In the film, Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) plays Charlie Bucket, an innocent and selfless boy who lives in a little old lopsided house with his parents and grandparents from both sides of the family. They're so impoverished that they only have enough money to buy him one Wonka chocolate bar once a year for his birthday. So when Willy Wonka decides to give out five golden tickets wrapped inside of five Wonka bars scattered throughout the world for a tour of his secret chocolate factory, Charlie looks forward to his next birthday more than any of the others before it.After getting chocolate for his birthday, and Grandpa Joe (played by David Kelly of Waking Ned Devine) coughing up dough for another - Charlie, while grateful for the chocolate, does not get a golden ticket. As three times is usually a charm, Charlie finds a ten dollar bill in the snow and buys one more chocolate bar and ends up being the last child in the world to find a golden ticket. Along with snobby rich girl Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), German choc-o-holic Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), smart-mouth Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) and gum-chewing champion Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) - Charlie enters the factory with the four other lucky, but undeserving winners. Little do they know what wonders (and dangers) lie ahead - let alone how fun it is for the audience to enjoy it all.While the visuals in the Gene Wilder version were great for the time, we're treated to a much bigger and more epic version of the factory in this film. Updated with modern CGI and effects, we're given greater visuals of such things as optical illusions, a flying glass elevator that can go any direction, vast passageways, chocolate waterfalls, eatable landscapes, trained squirrels, and even 'Fudge Mountain' (literally the size of a real mountain that lies underneath a real sky contained within the factory somehow).This film shows us that Willy Wonka's chocolate factory is not constrained by the various laws of reality. It's a fantasy world that's isolated from the outside world - which is sort of a skewed reality in and of itself, with such things as Wonka building a chocolate palace overseas, or the existence of 'Loompa Land' and its strange little inhabitants. Burton directs the picture so that we just accept the reality in which we're given, and that's what makes this film work.The Oompa Loompas, who work for Wonka in exchange for wages consisting of coca-beans, are a delight to observe. They're all played by one man (Deep Roy), an already vertically-challenged actor who is digitally duplicated and shrunk to look extra tiny for the film. The Oompa Loompas treat us to wonderfully humorous and witty musical numbers that make us giggle with glee. Who would've thought that Roy, who played a quiet circus performer in Big Fish, could be so funny, imitating various 'Esther Williams' swimming moves, or mimicking rock bands like The Beatles and Kiss. This is by far the most entertaining aspect of the film.Thanks to a wonderfully adapted screenplay by John August (Big Fish), this version gives us not only an updated look for the story and funny Oompa Loompas, but also provides an amusing back story of Wonka and the factory, and insight as to why Willy Wonka is sort of two fries short of a Happy Meal. Willy Wonka is a seriously disturbed individual in this film, socially awkward and kind of rude. But while Gene Wilder simply was the way he was in the 1971 film without any explanation, this one actually goes deep into Wonka's childhood and his relationship with his father (played by Christopher Lee of The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars series) and gives us an explanation. This ultimately paves the way for a beautiful ending in which Wonka actually learns a valuable lesson from Charlie.Not much fault can be found with the film. It may err a bit in that while titled 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,' the story tends to shift focus much more onto Willy Wonka's character journey than on Charlie's. While I can't say if that's closer to the book, it is such an intriguing journey that audiences really don't seem to mind. Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch in any film he's in, so we just have grown accustomed to him being in the spotlight. And perhaps Charlie, while still a kid, has already been on the journey because of his excursion through poverty and it's now his turn to help someone else in need.Does it top the original? In many ways, yes it does. It's much closer to the book according to Burton, and now we know why Willy Wonka is so loopy. Johnny Depp delivers one of the funniest performances of his career, and just like in Finding Neverland, he and Freddie Highmore have great chemistry together on screen. This movie is a treat for all ages - one that is funny and entertaining and stands above the original film as yet another great cinematic achievement for Tim Burton.",10,1,3,25 September 2005
From Hell," Pretty good story, but it's a bad movie
","I understand that the Jack the Ripper story involves prostitutes. So there's going to have to be sexual references. But any movie can convey the idea of prostitution without showing what goes on during prostitution. All we need to see is the woman hitting on the guy, and her taking him off to some place alone. We don't need to see a woman giving a guy a hand job and him banging her into a fence. We don't need to see what goes on in the bedroom. We don't need to see sickly 'girl-kissing-girl' crap. The idea of prostitution can be conveyed much more subtlety, which in my opinion would be more effective in this film since it's not a film about prostitution. It's a film about Jack the Ripper who kills prostitutes. Showing so many sexual obscenities didn't help the film. It just made it disgusting to watch.I did like the actual story when it actually got around to telling it about a half hour or so into it (after the first half hour being basically a tame porno flick). I like how they involved the Freemasons, and how we eventually came to understand who Jack the Ripper was and why he was the way he was. Johnny Deep and Heather Graham were good in this film. The story had a decent mystery to it that at least kept me watching until the end to see the mystery solved......but the film was just too hard to watch with all the obscenity in it, and I don't think I'll ever watch it again. It's too bad, because it really had the potential of being a great film had it not been directed by a couple of perverts.",Null,1,2,10 September 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," A worthy sequel
","OK, let me first say that the first 'Matrix' film is a crowning achievement. It stands on its own, and can appeal to most mainstream audiences. Most anyone can understand the plot. With Reloaded, however, people didn't really understand it. But they figured, 'Hey, there's a third one coming out, so it'll all become clear when I see that one.' So because of this thinking, most peoples' first impression of Reloaded wasn't negative. And first impressions usually stick. They just brushed off all of the convoluted plot and enjoyed it for what it is, expecting the third one to offer clearer explanations. And so because Revolutions didn't offer any clear answers, Reloaded is looked at as the better of the two sequels by most people. I think that's a pretty unfair observation myself. Both films are equally convoluted in my opinion. But the third in a trilogy is usually meant to give closure, and for many it did not succeed. Reloaded did not have that obligation, thus it's looked at in a better light than Revolutions is.But I find that the answers ARE in Revolutions, however vague they are. If one understands what Revolutions was really all about, then people should at least see both sequels in an equal light. They'll not only like Revolutions, but they'll also enjoy Reloaded even more than before - now that they actually get what's going on.My personal opinion is that Reloaded is the weakest of the trilogy. I think it's good, but because of that 5 minute party/orgy/sex scene that totally stopped the movie in its tracks, and too much dialogue at times, I rate it lower than the rest. And I liked the action in Revolutions much better (although the highway chase and the Neo/Smith burly brawl in Reloaded are definitely cool). 'The Matrix' is a 10, 'The Matrix Reloaded' is an 8, and 'The Matrix Revolutions' is a 9.For further info on the plot of the trilogy, check out www.thematrix101.com . I found it to be really good at helping me understand the films more, since I was also someone who found them too convoluted at first. Once the plots became clear, I came to really love these films. I hope that you'll do the same, because there's a lot more there besides kung fu fights and war scenes. I think you'll find that the Wachowski brothers didn't sacrifice substance for style after all.",8,0,1,27 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best film in the saga
","What happens when innocence gets corrupted? When goodness is taken over by a tragic evil? You get Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), and his transformation into the pop culture iconic villain known to virtually everyone in the world as 'Darth Vader.'In Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, audiences will finally experience Anakin's inevitable destiny. Here we find out that he has become a galactic hero in the eyes of the Republic, and his friendship with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) has matured into brotherly love. He's become an even better pilot than in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, and in the beginning of the film plays the main heroic role in rescuing the kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the 'clutches' of the evil Sith Lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and the new cyborg leader of the Separatists, General Grievous (Mathew Wood). But when all seems well, we find out that the kidnapping, as well as the entire war was staged by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and throughout the rest of the film Anakin Skywalker becomes susceptible to his lies - which in turn lead him down the path of the dark side of the force.Every Star Wars fan has wanted to see Anakin transform into Vader. We all wanted to see him and Obi-Wan become enemies. We were eager to see Padme die and the Skywalker twins birthed into existence. The birth of the Empire, the Jedi Knights getting hunted down and slaughtered and the Chancellor declaring himself Emperor were all things fans have been dreaming to see since the first original Star Wars back in 1977. We wanted all this because we know it leads us into the old Star Wars trilogy that we know and love. However, when I finally got to see this film I didn't want any of it to happen by the time it got over with. I actually cared about the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan to the point where it was saddening to watch them fight each other. I actually wanted Padme to live. I wanted the Emperor to get defeated. I wanted the Jedi Knights to live. I wanted Anakin to stay good. When this happened to my emotions, despite the fact that for years I wanted the dots to be connected with the old trilogy, I knew that George Lucas succeeded in telling a great story. A story that makes one go against all sense of logic, rips apart one's emotions and yet still makes the person come out loving the film in the end.Is it perfect? Well, it's as perfect as a Star Wars film can get since none of the films have ever been known for great acting and dialog. Wooden acting and cheesy dialog is what makes Star Wars what it is. However, I felt this film had the least amount of those things. I believed the characters were real, and the situations they were going through were authentic. The movie encompassed a broad range of emotions, from fun and energetic, to sorrowful and tragic. With thrilling action and special effects, as well as a dark and harrowing story, it's engaging from start 'till finish. In my humble opinion it truly is the best of the entire six-film saga.",9,2,5,21 May 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," One word - Perfect.
","In my opinion, this movie is absolutely flawless. Never have I witnessed such a perfect movie. It doesn't get any better than this, nor will it ever again.But some people still think there are flaws.Well, I suppose people are entitled to be wrong.The long ending needs to be the way it is. Not just because that's how the book is (actually, the book is longer at the end), but because we have to have an ending that ends the story of all the important people involved with the Ring. It is ONE ending, about the people involved with the ONE Ring.The absence of Saruman. Not a flaw. It's about how much Peter Jackson is allowed to put in theaters. He has a time limit. Saruman's only filmed scene in the movie was 7 minutes long and all dialogue and at the beginning of the movie. That's seven minutes that we could be getting on to more important things. Let's face it: Saruman is not the main bad guy. Sauron is. Saruman was defeated at Isengard by the Ents, because Isengard itself was destroyed and his army was destroyed at Helm's Deep. He is now imprisoned inside his tower to live in misery. He got what he deserves. Now it's time to deal with the real bad guy.It's also kind of a chance for redemption for Saruman. Remember, he was once good. He only turned evil because he was corrupted by his lust for the ring. But even so, he DOES get the torture he deserves. Death is too good for him. Let him rot. So what if we don't see him? Besides, he will be in the extended version released later next year.This is truly a great film. After it was over, I thought I was dreaming because movies are never THIS good. A lot are really great and all, but none come even close to how good this one is. Nor will they ever. It's absolutely incredible, and no complement I give it will do the movie justice. It's untouchable, and will go down in film history as the greatest film of all time.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Lord of the Rings is the best film of all time.
","Minor Spoilers...One word can be used to summarize this movie:Perfect.Well, at least it was perfect for me. Some people complain about an overly long ending, others complain about there being no Saruman, and the list goes on.I, however, basically had no problems with those things and most of the other complaints people have had, which aren't many. Most people loved this film. I am no different.This film deserved every Oscar it won. The movie was simply amazing. Everything from the beautiful battle scenes, the acting, and the story were top notch. I really don't think anyone can ask for a better conclusion to a trilogy and not be insane.I loved how the subject of friendship was used. Sam's willingness to go until death for Frodo was just amazing. I don't know one person who didn't feel incredible emotion when Sam says, 'I can't carry it for you, Mr. Frodo, but I can carry you!' Howard Shore's 'Into the West' score combined with this already emotional scene just makes one weep. In fact, Shore's score for this entire film was amazing.I also really loved the ending. Why? Wasn't it too long? Absolutely not. I felt that this was a perfect ending to a trilogy. We're not just ending one film here, but three films(or one very long film). There's much more to conclude than just saying, 'Ok, the battle's won so let's all go home now. The End.' That just wouldn't be good enough. It's imperative that we see Frodo re-unite with the Fellowship. It's imperative that we see the celebration at Minis Tirith. It's imperative that we follow up on Frodo and Sam's lives after all that's happened to them, especially the Grey Havens since the subject of people having to go to the Grey Havens to leave Middle Earth has been referred to throughout all three films. And, for fans of the books, this film could not have ended without Sam saying, 'Well, I'm back.'The ending was an ending for every main character who was in possession of, tempted by, or involved with the One Ring. It was an ending to the Fellowship. So we must deal with every character in some way, some more than others(like Frodo and Sam). In my opinion it is ONE ending, because it deals with everyone involved with the ONE Ring.That, and every scene in the ending was just absolutely beautiful. And I think once people watch it on DVD, a medium in which one can take breaks, then the people who didn't like the ending will grow more fond of it. Most people were just tired of sitting in the theater for three hours straight that they were ready to get out of there, despite the fact that this ending was needed. I think these films really need an intermission half way through when viewed in a theater.[SIDE BAR] The absence of Saruman is something I do sorely miss. However, the way the scene is filmed where the 'Voice of Saruman' chapter WOULD be is true to the book. But now, from rumors I'm hearing that we'll actually see Saruman get killed in the Extended Edition, I'm leaning towards the way the theatrical cut has this scene. The reason being because if we see Saruman actually die, then it's a completely different ending to Saruman's story. In the theatrical cut, from what we observe, he's locked in his tower to rot and wither away over time with no real confrontation from Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, etc. 'And there he must remain...He's no power anymore' to quote Gandalf. That's exactly the opposite of what happens in the Extended Editions(if what I've heard is true). Sure, it'll be great to see Saruman in ROTK. But a totally different ending for him?The reason I'm bringing this up is because the Extended Editions of the first two films only enhanced the story. It didn't change it. The plot was still the same throughout. Sure, there were different scenes replacing theatrical cut scenes here and there, but the outcome of the plot was the same. The Extended Editions should only enhance the plot, not change it. I'll learn to live with it just for the sake of seeing Saruman, but I don't think that's the best way to go about it. As of right now, I don't have a problem with Saruman missing from ROTK. [END SIDE BAR]One minor flaw in this film was the demise of the Witch King. I really don't think the idea that only a woman could kill him was emphasized enough, because they say in the film that 'No man can kill him.' But referring to 'man' could imply mankind. I don't know if there's any good way that this could've been said without ruining the surprise of Eowyn killing him. Maybe it could've been worded a different way. The dialogue could go something like this[referencing the book]: 'It was prophecied [by the elves?] that no man can kill him. But I [Gandalf] have hope that perhaps someday someONE will.' Because the way it comes off is like some girl power thing. I'll live with it, but I just thought the idea of it all could've been described and executed better.The other plot line involving the Witch King was the one where the Sloth-looking orc asks him, 'What of the Wizard[Gandalf]?' Then the Witch King says, 'I will break him.' But then we never see any confrontation whatsoever. The Extended Edition will cover this since there was a confrontation filmed. It was actually in the theatrical trailer. The way it is now technically works. We just assume the Witch King either never got around to it, or it happens off screen. But ultimately this is a bad edit, and they should've just left out that little bit of dialogue between the orc and the Witch King, and just have it be apart of the Extended Edition along with the actual confrontation.Minor (and very few) flaws aside, this film is beautiful, emotional, and ultimately the best film I have ever seen. Actually, I really should say that The Lord of the Rings is the best film I have ever seen, because ROTK is only the conclusion to one long movie split into three parts which were all excellent. Nothing has ever been done quite like it, and it's something that will be treasured for generations to come.",10,0,4,19 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," This is the best film ever made.
","I know, I know. There are a lot of films out there. And to say that this is the best film every made is truly a high honor, and should not just be given to anyone.But I truly feel that The Return of the King IS the best film ever made, and that the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best film trilogy ever made. I should actually say simply that The Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best film ever made, because it was all filmed back-to-back as if it was one film, and the storyline continues right where we left off in the previous film.This trilogy truly deserves the recognition it gets, because there has never been any film project that's endured so much. The people who made these movies put more time, effort, passion, and love into these films than any other movie to date. Just watch the documentaries on the Extended Edition DVD box sets and you'll see what I mean. No film project has EVER matched how much this film crew went through.And never have we seen a film crew work so hard and achieve perfect films. They ARE perfect in every way. The story is excellent. The acting is excellent. The visuals are astounding. And I don't think I've ever seen a fantasy film that felt more real that these films. They really pulled off what Tolkien had intended with his books - that we're supposed to believe it was a real historic tale long forgotten.With The Return of the King specifically, there were parts that were just so emotionally driven that I almost cried. That never happens for me. The acting was just phenomenal. Every visual effects shot was an absolute masterpiece. It was very intense, and it is a great conclusion to the trilogy.As far as some people's complaints about the ending, they just don't know what the ending is truly all about. This is an ending to all who were tempted by the ring or were in possession of it. And it's an ending to an entire trilogy. We really needed time to wind down and find out what happens in our beloved characters' lives after the victory of Sauron's destruction. I think that people were just tired of sitting in the theater for 3 hours, and all the fade-outs were faking them out that the movie was ending. I bet those people will love the ending much more when they can watch it on DVD and pace themselves throughout the whole viewing of the film. The ending is truly spectacular and IMHO is perfect.Overall, this movie is a 12 out of 10. This is my favorite film of all time.",10,0,1,11 February 2004
V for Vendetta," Meh, it's decent.
","V For Vendetta is a peculiar movie. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore (who, for some reason disowned the project) it has been adapted to contain a rousing beginning and ending, but gets too talky in the middle. This comes as no surprise, however, as the screenplay was written by the Wachowski Brothers - the same guys who directed The Matrix Reloaded, which suffered from similarly flawed storytelling. It seems that handing the directing job over to James McTeigue was not enough.But this is not to say that the film is a total dud. It is not. It contains an interesting tale of a man who calls himself 'V,' (played by Hugo Weaving from The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings films) who stands against a totalitarian Great Britain of the not so distant future. He wears a mask reminiscent of Guy Fawkes, who on November 5, 1605 attempted to blow up King James I and the Houses of Parliament. Therefore, V means to blow up similar landmarks of Great Britain on November 5th in order to get his point across - that totalitarianism sucks, and freedom should reign supreme. In the meantime, he seeks out his revenge on his enemies who have wronged him in the past.Crossing paths with V is Evey (Natalie Portman), a woman whose family was persecuted because of this new regime, but for some reason stills lives an ordinary life - up until she meets V, that is. From that point on, V helps her cope with her past and ultimately side with his ideals. Unfortunately, her character does not offer more than that. Good thing Natalie is a good actress (aside from her poor attempt at a British accent), or there would be nothing going for this character at all. It seems that her character just gets us from A to B, with nothing really all that exhilarating in between.Much has been said about this movie being anti-George W. Bush or anti-conservative. This can be looked at in two ways. On the one hand, it appears to be nothing more than just be a reflection of Adolf Hitler or Saddam Hussein and their ideals, since the leader of this future Great Britain, Adam Sutler (John Hurt), is labeled as a conservative (in the same sense Hitler was and Saddam is, which is more extreme), and this totalitarian state he governs seems to reflect similar ideals - especially with a scene or two in the film where people are killed, stripped naked and piled into a ditch like the holocaust.On the other hand, the people who he persecutes and/or censors are not Jews or Kurds. They are Muslims and homosexuals. Even though James McTeigue claims this film is 'an allegory of all governments,' it does come off as more of an allegory of the United States and its conservative leaders, because our current conservative leaders are mostly Christian, and the Christian faith teaches that other faiths and homosexuality are wrong. This is not to say that Christians commonly persecute Muslims or gays. This film simply presents a vision of what could happen if leaders in government became extreme in these ideals like Hitler and denied people the freedom to believe and live as they wish.Whether this movie anti-Bush or anti-conservative is up to the individual viewing the film. But one thing is for certain: the whole idea of this film is to preach freedom. So while comparing conservative Christians to Hitler may seem extreme, our right to even say this in our country is a privilege to treasure.Political differences aside, this film does get its point across and delivers some exciting moments. Hugo Weaving brings a delightful (and sometimes humorous) performance as V, and we're treated to some great visuals and action sequences when the film gets exciting.But sadly, the film's exciting moments are few and far between, as uninteresting characters are given more screen time than the much more intriguing V character. And like what was said before, we are given too much dialogue and not enough show. The Wachowskis still have not found their way back to the proper balance between show and tell, and could take some lessons from the Wachowskis of 1999 who made the first Matrix film. Seeing this film was not a regrettable experience - just a forgettable one.",5,3,7,19 March 2006
