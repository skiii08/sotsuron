Scarface," Scarface - Vintage 80's at its best
","Al Pacino at his very best delivering classic 'Americana' in virtually every way. I don't think think another actor could have pulled Tony Montana off so well. The casting director deserves a medal for choosing such a perfect supporting crew especially in regards to Michelle Pfiffer who really did an excellent job of portraying the bitchy,bored trophy wife caught in the middle of a perfect storm. I personally would love to see a remake of this movie, but the drug world has changed a lot since then with many movies covering the narco culture topic. Best to leave Scarface where it is.",10,4,7,17 February 2016
The Exorcist," A Movie to be Seen Many Times Over from Different Prospectives
","It's the 70's and Vietnam is coming to an end, woman's lib furthers its manifestations, the sexual revolution is in full swing and Alice Cooper's domination of America are some of the big happenings at this time, along with church attendance being at an all time high. Out of the blue comes along a low key movie about a little girl possessed by the Devil and having to undergo a 14th century excorcism. The timing couldn't have been better for this movie's release and it caught the world by storm. The most interesting thing about this particular movie is that it needs to be watched a few times. During one showing it's outright horror classic at its best. In another showing it's a muder mystery case. In another it makes us reflect on the balances of good vs evil the existence of God and the Devil and makes us reflect on our own values. It's one of those movies that are a must see throughout one's life even if it's only once and will keep you up many nights especially after just seeing it.",Null,0,0,17 February 2016
