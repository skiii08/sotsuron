"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," A Classic
","A lot of excellent psychology here, and a lot of excellent acting. Stamp had a handful, to play a transsexual without limp wrists, without--on the whole--stereotypes. Transsexuals tell me that--just as in this film--they've known since they were children that there was a mismatch between body and brain. It's in the story; it's in the character--right where it should be. I found the film tender, sweet, real, hard-edged, tough. The ending is full of surprises--not just one but several, all sprung on the viewer within a short space of time, almost like an Agatha Christie novel, but with even more of the 'I should have known' factor. I recommend it--but it's not for homophobics, those who cannot cry, or those who are sure that homosexuality is not a hormonal accident but a sin.",Null,3,6,8 November 2004
Pocahontas," Will the real Pocahontas please stand up?
","My mother used to say I was descended from the real Pocahontas's tribe, but I never saw any evidence to that effect. Nevertheless, it interested me in looking up her story. The real story is that she was a hostage of the white settlers, assigned to Capt. Smith when she was a teenager captured from her father's house. Since this was a well-known Indian custom (and ancient practice among humans), there was little surprise or action proceeding from this kidnapping, and she was a hostage to peace between the Powhatans and the Europeans. It is unknown what Smith's and Pocahontas's feelings were about each other. Smith took her, still a teenager, to England dressed in English clothing of the time (and most of the true portrayals of Pocahontas are in English clothing). Smith did marry her, and Pocahontas bore him a child. She died of (I think) tuberculosis before she and her family could sail back to the US, at the age of 19, having been displayed at the English court as a reformed savage.",Null,0,3,6 November 2004
