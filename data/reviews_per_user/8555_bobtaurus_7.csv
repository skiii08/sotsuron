Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not as Funny as I'd Heard, But Has Its Moments
","My guess is that if you've never seen the Borat character before (on 'Da Ali G Show' on HBO or DVD), you'll probably think 'Borat' is hysterical. However, as one who was already familiar with the character, the movie was a bit of a letdown, especially considering the hype around it.Yes, there were some very funny scenes, but there were also stretches of not-so-funny or I've-already-seen-this scenes. What really works is when Borat is interacting with 'civilians' who *know* they're on camera and have *agreed* to be on camera. To me, that's always been the beauty of Cohen's comedy. What's much less amusing are innocent passers-by reacting to Borat imposing himself upon them. The staged scenes between Borat and the people of his village (including his producer 'Azmarat') don't work as well, either. (A notable exception takes place in a hotel room, but I don't want to elaborate with a spoiler.) I rate this movie 7 out of 10. If you equate outrageousness with humor (as did, in my opinion, the people who *loved* 'There's Something About Mary'), you'll like it more than I did. I, however, was raised on Monty Python, so while outrageousness can be part of the package (e.g. the Black Knight scene in 'Holy Grail'), for me, there's got to be a little more behind it than simply shock value. Sometimes, 'Borat' succeeds in this, but just as often, it doesn't.",7,0,3,2 February 2007
Molly's Game," Solid Sorkin
","I've never seen anything written by Aaron Sorkin that wasn't good, and Molly's Game is no exception. Smart, compelling, and excellently acted top to bottom.",8,4,4,24 May 2020
Knocked Up," Good Heart Doesn't Save Shaky Plot
","Please know that I'm rooting like crazy for Judd Apatow to be an enormous success after the way NBC mishandled his brilliant 'Freaks and Geeks,' and because I enjoyed 'The 40-Year Old Virgin.' However, 'Knocked Up' misses the mark in several ways.The main plot point, as others have mentioned, is a little too hard to swallow. *SPOILER* (I wonder if scenes that illuminated why Heigl's character fell for Rogan's or how Rogan's character suddenly landed a job wound up on the cutting room floor.) *END OF SPOILER*The depiction of Rogan and his roommates are a sort of comedic fantasy of what it's like to be four, crude, single guys sharing a house. That would be fine, but it just ain't that funny (for the most part). As likable an actor as Seth Rogan is, it was pretty hard for me to like him in this, despite that plot contortions to elicit the audience's sympathy.What saves this film from failure is the provocative, original dialog in the more serious moments that explores relationship issues and gender differences. Plus, the acting is good all around.Maybe this film is better if you go see it as stoned as some of its characters are. Still, it is a cut above your average raunchy comedy.",6,5,12,25 June 2007
Ratatouille," Why So Popular?
","Please understand that I write as someone who thoroughly enjoyed prior Pixar efforts: Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo, etc. However, as That_American_Chick wrote recently, the animation is the only exceptional quality of 'Ratatouille.' There's nothing particularly wrong with the movie; it's just lacking in anything particularly good. The story line and the attempts at humor are, by and large, very predictable. Considering some movie critics put 'Ratatouille' in their Top Ten lists for 2007, I expected something more. Granted, you could do worse; there's nothing off-putting here, but when the movie ended, my wife and I looked at each other and said, 'That's it? What's the big deal?'",6,2,5,6 January 2009
Pi," Artsy Doesn't Mean Interesting
","The ideas contained in 'Pi' are rather interesting, but unless you're a huge fan of, say, David Lynch's 'Eraserhead' or 'Blue Velvet,' which I am not, you're bound to find this promising film as tedious as I did.Scenes that are meant only to convey the mood or state of mind of the protagonist seem to go on forever. It is only when the protagonist interacts with other people that 'Pi' manages to hold my interest.It's too bad, really, because I did appreciate the originality of the story being told, and the obvious homage to the surrealist film 'Le Chien Andaluse (The Andalusian Dog)'. (For example, there's a shot during one of the games of Go of a black stone held in the palm of a hand, which is extremely similar to 'Le Chien's' shot of the hand with a hole in the palm with ants crawling out of it. Ants, by the way, also figure prominently in the visuals of 'Pi.')",4,0,1,12 September 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Great Idea for a Much Shorter Film
","Having been written by Charlie Kaufman, 'Eternal Sunshine' has a fascinating premise and unravels in a way that plays with the flow of time. Jim Carey shows that his excellent work in 'The Truman Show' was no fluke; he is completely believable as a shy introvert (!). Kate Winslet, as usual, is also very good.As the first part of the movie unfolded, I was completely drawn in and fascinated with the story and characters. However, the middle just seemed to go on and on, adding little to the plot nor my understanding of the characters' relationship. Thankfully, the last 15 minutes moved the plot in new and interesting ways.Compared with Kaufman's 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' (both of which I'd rate with 10s), 'Eternal Sunshine' lacked the skillful story-telling to keep me involved throughout. However, its inventive plot and skillful performances saves it from being a disappointment. 6/10",6,0,1,28 June 2004
Ray," Writing Doesn't Rise to the Performances
","The acting in 'Ray' was, from top to bottom, outstanding. And yes, Jamie Foxx was as great as you heard he was. And the art direction and cinematography are excellent as well.However, as often seems to be the problem with modern bio-pics, this film is overly long, clocking in at 2 hours, 45 minutes!). Yet, even at that length, plot points are left hanging.***SPOILER*** What happened to the announcer guy who seemed to take over Ray's career in the 60's? We're never told. ***END SPOILER***Still, 'Ray' is certainly worth renting for the great music and acting performances.",6,0,3,12 September 2005
