Alien 3," A big turnoff
","Even in the first two Alien films, several people were killed by the Aliens, you got a sense of triumph: good had won out over evil. In an attempt to extend the Alien series beyond its true life, they came up with an unbelievable concept (as it goes in the world of film) to extend this series. Heck, they even went to ludicrous lengths in Alien: Resurrection.This was a film made for monetary gain, nothing more. I found nothing satisfying about watching a strong character who overcame adversity in 2 other films to only die senslessly in this one. Shame on the people who made this movie (and Alien: Resurrection) .",1,534,591,10 May 2005
