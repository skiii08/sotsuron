The Expendables 2," Lights, camera, Action! Bang Bang boom!
","This movie is much better than the first part. Reminds me of True lies, Rambo and so many 90's action flick. Bang on action! Some amazing funny scenes and dialogs. Simon west's direction is good.Fast screenplay. I specially liked the intro scene. Some amazing performances at this age by the ensemble cast. Chuck Norrris at 72, Arnold and Stallone both above 60, Bruce Willis at 57 and Van Damme at 50, its amazing to see them in action. Jet Li should have got more screen time. Also the final fight could have an extended screen time. My personal favorite was Van damme and his signature flying kick. Its a fun entertainer. Do watch it.",7,0,0,29 November 2012
Skyfall," 007 has a flair for style and substance. ALWAYS!
","James Bond's hobby is resurrection. And he does it which such a flair! SKYFALL, I felt is a mixture of nostalgia and newness.The movie is quite a change from last 2 field works of Daniel Craig. But he still smites you with his quirky charms and confidence. A farewell movie for Judi Dench with good moments. The villain, Javier Bardem was pretty evil to mommy M in his ways. I personally liked Bérénice Marlohe in her brief act and she does grab your attention. The cinematography is so colourful and attractive by Roger Deakins. Some really beautifully and impressive shot scenes of Turkey, Shanghai, and Scotland. The setup made in Macau was just drop-dead gorgeous! Also cars blowing up right from Beetles to the old Aston Martin DB5 of Goldfinger. The screenplay and Sam Mendes's direction is at good pace and keeps you interested.The movie reminded me of Sean Connery's era with more suspense, thrills and espionage skills and less of hand combats, car chases and special gadgets which I did miss. Now I won't say its the best Bond movie or not, because I personally like all Bond movies, hate comparing them and always look forward to them. But SKYFALL will surely have its proud place in my movie collection, pretty soon! Must watch.",8,1,9,29 November 2012
Iron Man 3," A fragile Iron Man 3 suit, RD Jr still handles it! - (NO SPOILERS)
","I like the Iron Man franchise as from these movies I got introduced to this exceptional actor, Robert Downey Jr. I always look forward to his movies. He has a personality so unique and it perfectly suits the character Tony Scott. The panic attacks, the humor, every detailing of his character in this movie has been well executed by him.Iron Man 3 was fun to watch summer superhero flick. This is the first movie I am watching which is directed by Shane Black. The screenplay is fast. The story for me is average with fewer laughs and not better than the first 2 movies of the franchise. The only thing which saved this movie for me was Robert Downey Jr.'s charm and the amazing climax which was a treat to watch. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts looks very fit & pretty. She gives a nice performance as her character gets more detailed and has a friction with boyfriend Tony Stark. Ben Kingsley is an unexpected surprise package to watch out for, but is it likable or not, thats for you to decide. Guy Pearce is smart and gives a good performance.The cinematography and action & VFX sequences are very cool and do entertain you to an extent. Especially the climax action and the scene where Tony & Pepper reunite. Tony's brief camaraderie with the little kid was sweet but not memorable. The direction of Shane Black was good but not without flaws. I liked the dark humor but at times it border lined Iron Man as a superhero ridiculing himself to the brink! I liked the advances of the technology that Tony is been shown integrating in his new Iron Man suits, but showing them being shattered into pieces every now and then depletes the Superhero quality in Tony for which he is looked up by the audience. Tony Stark is a genius and by the 3rd movie he should be so brilliant at making suits, that the suit can't end up being a piece of joke which really irked me. Secondly though the thought of Mandarin was a very good one as an antagonist, it wasn't executed in a deadly way. The villains of the first 2 movies were far more effective.Overall if you are fan of Iron Man, you will like Iron Man 3 withstanding its shortcomings. Otherwise its a onetime watch. Robert Downey Jr.deserves one more outing for sure in the Iron Man suit, as I applause his performance and wait for the next sequel, hopefully!",6,0,2,13 May 2013
Life of Pi," Beautiful moments. Artistic with a special Indian touch.
","'All of life is an act of letting go but what hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.' Thats the quote spoken by Irfan khan, which I'll cherish from this movie, Life of Pi.The movie is spectacular in 3D. The camera work is beautiful and so are the locales. The screenplay is tight and the story is simple yet director Ang Lee has artistically made a different world in the movie. The CGI animation and effects of the tiger are so admirable that you won't believe that every shot on the boat with Suraj Sharma(young Pi) doesn't have any real tiger. That also shows the brilliance of Suraj's act as Pi patel, who was chosen from 3000 hopefuls for the lead role. Irfan Khan has such a good command over his dialogues, he grabs your attention instantly. Tabu and Adil Hussain are good in their brief roles.Honestly, the movie did remind me of one of my favourite movies, 'Cast Away' starring Tom Hanks, which is incomparable. But Life of Pi has its moments and a special Indian touch. Do watch it in 3D.",7,2,5,29 November 2012
Oblivion," Oblivion - Unique sci-fi movie with a unique title. Deserves a watch! (NO Spoilers!)
","Tom Cruise is one of my favourite actors. And he collaborating with Joseph Kosinski for OBLIVION makes it even more exciting as I was extremely impressed with Joseph's debut directorial- 'Tron Legacy' which I missed watching on the big screen. So I had to watch OBLIVION in a theatre for sure.I won't write any spoilers because otherwise it won't be a must watch film. Oblivion is a sci-fi fantasy with full on suspense, thrills and the sci-fi part is just the vessel carrying the story with an emotional core that has a beautiful connect to the audience. It gives out a loud message that no matter how hard we try to be like practical machines in the modern era, we are still only humans with feelings.The cast is small but effective. Tom Cruise as Jack Harper is as usual a brilliant protagonist and gives the film a replay value. But its my personal wish to see him for a change in a complete drama, romance or a historical epic again. (like Vanilla Sky, Jerry Maguire and The Last Samurai). Andrea Riseborough gives some steamy scenes with Tom, specially the unique swimming pool scene is to look out for, which is aesthetically shot. I found her performance far better than Olga Kurylenko (the ex Bond girl). Morgan Freeman in his brief role is memorable.The cinematography & VFX shots are spectacular. Reminds me a bit of 'Prometheus' which is good in a way and adds to the realism of the plot. The 'shattered moon' shown in the sky is a brilliantly creative example of the visual effects.The story is quite unique though I wish the duration could have been decreased and the climax could have been more interesting than it is. Some amazing futuristic gadgets are shown in the movie like Jack's ship and his cool bike which are visually appealing on the big screen.I can't forget to praise the amazing sound and background music. Tron Legacy's soundtrack is already a hit and Joseph Kosinski made sure this was no less. He as a director has shown excellence again and Oblivion is entertaining enough to question that this was his second movie only! Really impressive.Oblivion is a good movie, a commendable attempt for bringing an air of freshness in sci-fi genre, even though it falls short to be a masterpiece. Must watch experience.",8,7,13,17 April 2013
Hugo," Hugo! Sweet and beautiful.
","Finally saw this movie which I wanted to see for a long time as its directed by Martin Scorsese.Hugo is a beautifully made movie to begin with. The cinematography of Robert Richardson is top notch. Wish had seen it in 3D. The starting train station sequence and vfx is gorgeous. The story is cute though a bit flat at times. But I did like the story coz of the character Hugo and because its a movie about the humble beginnings of 'movie making' business itself.Asa Butterfield as young Hugo acted well as he makes you empathize for his purpose as he goes on with his adventure. The cute Chloe Grace Moretz is a surprise as I really liked her in the movie 'Kick Ass'. She complements Hugo and is delight to watch. Ben Kingsley is as good as he was in Shutter Island. Overall watch it for some sweet moments, a decent story and beautiful visuals and costumes.",7,3,4,29 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spider-boredom!
","Not the spidey experience I expected. The 3D effects were nice though inconsistent. The spidey costume, action and web sequences were good. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy was very cute.Now the negatives. Andrew Garfield never came close to Tobey Maguire's act as Peter Parker. I very much missed the character Mary Jane, the perennial love interest of Spiderman coz she is not in this movie! The story had many similarities with Spiderman (2002). Which makes it boring as its like a repeat telecast coz the original had far more adorable moments. The villain is just OK. Irfan khan had a blink-and-miss role in the movie.Overall I felt, marvel should have made part 4 of spider-man instead of rebooting the series. For me it was a good but not so amazing Spiderman!",2,1,11,29 November 2012
The Bourne Legacy," A boost to this wonderful series!
","Its been a longtime since I saw the first 3 movies in this series. So when I saw The Bourne Legacy, it was like a fresh start with some parts connected with previous movie in the series. Tony Gilroy who directed all Bourne movies has brought back the fast pace screenplay which keeps you interested till climax. Story is not something new. Beautiful visuals from Alaska to Philippines.Jeremy Renner was good in Ghost Protocol and even better as the lead, Aaron Cross. Brilliant action sequences, both fights and chase scenes. Wish the chase sequence was more in length. Rachel Weisz is the damsel in distress and she is good doing her part. The film would have been even better if it had more action. The movie is overall worth a watch for amazing action and performances by the lead pair. I would surely like to watch the whole series again. Must watch.",7,4,7,29 November 2012
Total Recall," Total Recall- One of the best sci-fi genre movies!
","This review of mine is more like my voice of disagreement with people who didn't like the 2012 version of Total Recall. But first I'll point out what I liked about both the versions.Total Recall(1990)- Of course Arnold. I felt a certain rawness in his act which I liked. He actually looked unaware of things going around, as his character required. For Sharon Stone,she was simply stunning! Enough said. The story was far ahead of it times and stands the same even today thats why it deserved a remake. This is the 2nd movie of Paul Verhoeven's direction that I have seen.(I have seen Hollowman), and his amazing work in Total Recall and Sharon Stone are the 2 reasons, I want to see Basic Instinct now. Also I liked the fact that this was one of the last movies which used miniatures,like for showing Mars planet. Bravo to the team, amazing work. Overall, an entertaining concept, performance and movie.Total Recall(2012)- I liked the major change in the original screenplay and not using idea of Mars and still keeping the same concept of the original Total Recall. Requires a lot of creativity to bring out and create something new from something which is already a blockbuster. Thats the most exciting part of this version. Of course there are scenes which are more of a tribute to the original and shot with new technology and effects. Colin Farrell is an amazing actor. I liked him in the flick 'The Recruit'(2003) and for me he was equally good in this one. Also in this movie, Colin Farrel doing a smooch scene with the director's wife(Kate Beckinsale) in front of him, requires a lot of confidence and professionalism. But Kate comes nowhere close to the charisma of Sharon Stone. Jessica Biel here stole the show. She did a good act. Len Wiseman as a director did take a risk of choosing this remake and I appreciate he came up with something like this. I liked his work in 'Die Hard 4'. This movie is not as huge hit as its predecessor, but its neither a complete washout. But personally I liked the remake and it was entertaining for me.Comparisions- I don't care why critics panned the 2012 version. Both versions were quite different in terms of execution of the same concept. Also I equally liked the sets and the ambiance created in both the movies. In the end, either ways I enjoyed the experience of Total Recall(just like Inception). But still if I had to pickup one thing better from another, then I would say, Total Recall(2012) missed out a point because it didn't have Sharon Stone! Must watch both of them!",7,1,2,26 January 2013
Jack Reacher," Tom Cruise going strong at 50.
","I haven't read any Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child. So I went for this movie just on the basis of the trailer and the impressive filmography of the lead actor. And I wasn't disappointed at all. Director Christopher McQuarrie who wrote 'Valkyrie' has joined hands with Tom Cruise once again. Jack Reacher is a kind of suspense, crime, action movie which I haven't seen for a while. Its a story of a crime investigator solving a case and finding the murderer of five lives. Tom Cruise as the lead is intelligent, confident, highly trained, ruthless, smarter than the cops and funny too as he never drives his own wheels. As the title goes, with every moving frame in the movie, the lead character gets more detailed, whether its the dialogues, some cut-scenes, his questioning about the crime scene and the motive behind it or just his impressive weapon skills. And Tom Cruise took this to his advantage and has given an admirable performance. Rosamund Pike is still as gorgeous as she was in Die Another Day. She has done a good act. Director Christopher McQuarrie has done a brilliant job. Special mention for cinematography by Caleb Deschanel, the car chase sequences are very beautifully captured and executed, so is the movie otherwise. The dialogues are really nice and keep the tempo of the movie. One of my favorites is the one also featured in the trailer, 'You think I am a hero? I am not a hero....', very well executed scene. The action scenes are good and not unrealistic. The only negative thing I felt was a little less screen time for the villains and just OK performances by them. Its the last movie that I saw in 2012, its an entertaining movie and surely worth a watch.",7,2,6,9 January 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Funny perfect Sunday movie!
","~NO SPOILERS~ Funny perfect Sunday movie! Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, his portrayal as this lustful, greedy and confident stock broker was superb, specially the white Lamborghini Countach scene, when he as Jordan Belfort is full high on drugs! Matthew McConaughey's act at the start of the movie was excellent. Margot Robbie looks gorgeous. Martin Scorsese's direction made sure this long story was always interesting with its black humour. Finally thanks to the real Jordan Belfort for telling his story to the world. A great movie for entertainment if you can ignore the use of 'F' word for at least 506 times in 3 hours! Also if you are smart enough, the movie can also teach you why its necessary at times, to not cross the line! For the love of Hollywood, don't miss this one!",8,0,5,6 January 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Christian Bale's best act as Batman!
","Saw this movie in IMAX. Its a 165 mins movie(the longest for Christopher Nolan) with approx. 50 mins IMAX footage! And boy I was completely hooked to it all the time. The best 2012 movie by far.Direction wise Nolan hasn't outdone himself as some say (He doesn't need to! For me nothing can come close to Inception) but he is doing best for sure. The story was good and nice end to the trilogy. Action sequences were awesome on IMAX.Acting wise, Christian Bale is the best for me, deserves acknowledgment. This is his best movie as Batman. You can empathize the pain of Bruce Wayne getting older and weaker and rising again. Tom Hardy who also acted in Inception is a complete surprise. His metamorphosis as vicious Bane is brilliant and good in his own way. Michael Caine gives beautiful moments to the movie. Anne Hathaway is classy and exudes confidence as Selina. The supporting cast is good.Excellent costumes and gadgets including the Aventador, the Bat, etc. Finally the magic that keeps you on the edge of your seats is the background score by Hans Zimmer. Its a must watch movie and IMAX is a must try larger than life experience!!",8,4,8,29 November 2012
Looper," An idea went terribly wrong!
","So went for this flick coz I found the trailer interesting. I really like sci-fi genre and the last movie in this genre I saw was 'In Time', which was very entertaining. Looper was not that much fun.I felt the director's execution was not up to the mark. Firstly the movie has no action scenes if you expect so. The 2nd half of the screenplay is very slow, gloomy and totally idiotic. The movie actually has 2 plots, 1)time travel and 2) the dangers of toddlers with uncontrollable telekinesis. Unfortunately, neither of these plots are well executed and so it ruins the whole movie.The climax defies all logics and the time travel has big a goof up and you end up thinking, how can the director can be so stupid! The lead cast was OK in the whole act. The whole premise of the film is never explained satisfactorily. Looper is a dismal train wreck of ideas with great potential. I will not recommend Looper.",1,16,31,29 November 2012
