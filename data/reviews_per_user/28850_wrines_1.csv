The Avengers," Best Superhero Movie Ever Made
","All I can say is 'WOW!'. After watching patiently every superhero movie since the original Superman in 1978 (most of them many times), I realize now that *this* was the one I have been waiting for. To say it was great would be incredibly unjust - there aren't many words to REALLY convey just how special it is. From the casting to the performances to the writing to the fine details to the effects to the dynamic interplay of the characters, this movie is simply hands down the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE. I wont give any of it away, and there were too many moments to even begin to describe anyway, but I will for sure be going back to see it at least a couple more times (which I NEVER do)and its one of the very few I will for SURE purchase when it is available. Instant classic, and a defining moment for the superhero movie genre. On the way out of the IMAX 3D theater where I saw it, beyond being simply stunned, I had 2 further immediate thoughts: 1) It was SO mind-numbing, and SO far above any superhero movie I have ever seen, that it reminded me of seeing the 1st Lord of The Rings movie (Fellowship) and how I was similarly stunned and literally dazed upon exiting the cinema... 2) I cant for the life of me figure out WHY the powers that be at DC have not yet come out with a Justice League movie in a similar ensemble fashion - their management is asleep at the wheel if that is NOT in development. Anyway back to the movie itself: Go see it, multiple times. You will thank me later.",10,10,21,6 May 2012
