Blade Runner 2049," Beatifully crafted, remarkable acting and director but the plot turns hack
","To watch Ryan Gosling 's hapless cop, literally a victim of circumstance, gradually climb from hopeless to hope, after passing through various stages of awakening, only to have to sacrifice it all, is the most painful and difficult plot aspect of this film. And the only worthy and lasting part of this movie. His performance is so layered, and he has captured the pathos of the everyman so perfectly, that at least an oscar nod is warranted. This is a new story in the Blade Runner universe, even darker than the first. The visuals are technically eye popping but much blander with less visual depth than the original. And they are so derivative from video games and other recent Sci Fi films. The buildings in the original Blade Runner were all lit. Here they are just dark and gray or orange tombs, more cg model than realistic renderings. And the bad guys are just comic book one dimensional bad guys. The evil megalomaniac is just lex Luther in a Jesus mask. His murderous body gaurd who cries before killing is completely devoid of purpose or depth. When she cries 'I'm the best one!' at the end we are like 'yah, 
brilliant dialogue..' Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling keep whatever life this film has going.Still, there's only so much cynicism, senseless violence and poor dialogue a viewer can take, even a huge fan of the original.",6,2,5,13 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Traditional, and a tear jerker. Being kleenex
","I really don't get the critics. Before seeing the film I poured through the reviews. My expectations were low. This was to be a patchwork of compromises. But as I watched the film today, those criticisms just had no connection. What I saw instead was a beautiful, well-paced story that pulled at the heart strings, a glowing work that honors Star Wars and all the original and current characters. This is certainly one of the finest of all the Star Wars films.",10,4,13,25 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Good but not Great. One last chance to get it right
","As with the Star Trek films JJ. Abrams has a few blind spots amidst all that storytelling genius. And it seems that Rian Johnson shares a couple of them. Result? Action heavy, depth light. They both operate on a formula that says, offer action first, then explain who the characters are later, or at best try to explain them in snappy one-liners. It doesn't always work. It's much better to care about the characters before putting them into danger. It makes the danger real and draws the viewer into the action. But when filmmakers just show you spectacular action before you know you know, connect with, or care about the characters, then it's just CGI spectacle, never real. And not impactful. The latter happens too often here In the original Star Wars we take time to learn who Luke is, and this puts him front and center, and grounded as the lead while the rest of the film's characters and stories revolve around him.Abrams took a similar approach with Rey in the first film successfully. We had a chance to learn about her in several non-action moments that came early enough in the film to nail the whole story together.Now, after so many decades, we return to Luke. Luke has been the underpinning for ALL Star Wars films. He is the running lead. The Prequels, while ostensibly about Darth Vader, are really about Luke's father. Every Star Wars film is a reference to Luke Skywalker. Every swing of a light Saber by every character in every Star Wars film is a reference to Luke's first swing in the presence of his masterm: hope and joy, his, the model of good vs evil for the entire series. Every light Saber battle has Luke, George and Mark's signature on it. Not only those in the films, but every imaginary light Saber battle played out by every child and young adult for the last forty years. Regardless of Luke, George and Mark's own shortcomings, this spirit rang through. And still rings through despite many flawed but well intended efforts to capture lightening in a bottle once more. It is appropriate that the entire first film of this latest trilogy would base its plot on finding Luke. We have waited thirty years for this. It was right.And while the Last Jedi returns the character of Luke embittered, ultimately, he is restored, with Spirit intact, and revived by the end, the martyr he was always destined to be. They got the general idea right. But we needed more exposition. Not the story around Luke's failure to train an ambitious and emotional Kylo, which was serviceable, if stretching credibility.We needed the story before that. And in a sequence of shots lasting more than three minutes. Luke is more powerful as a spirit, and if the film makers are right, they will emphasize this.Just as Mark Hamill became a fine actor able to handle the full weight of his task in Return of the Jedi, he has only gotten better, more layered, deeper. His character needs more time and interaction with several of the film's characters moving forward.Afterall, what did his success in Return of the Jedi accomplish? That is entirely absent. We need to see that all that fighting led to at least something like peace for a little while. Otherwise hope is just a commercial commodity of politicians without basis.Star Wars is fundamentally, and in its strongest telling, Luke's story.JJ., please remember this.As for the films best moments, they are at the end. When Luke kisses Leia, we also see Mark kissing Carrie, and all four know it is for the last time. It is heart wrenching . Carrie's failing health is evident in both of these last films, and her portrayal, her crowning achievement.I'm surprised they did not let her pass in the scene her ship is destroyed. But with so many battles the authors will find a way. You could see her visibly struggling to maintain herself on film and this added perfect dynamic tension to the role. She sacrifices herself for the sake of the story, the fans, and message. That deserves memorializing in the next film.",7,1,9,15 April 2018
Puss in Boots," Beautiful and fun
","A fine, fun adventure for kids and their parents. I saw it in old-fashioned 2D and a couple of scenes knocked my socks off. First and foremost, the acting was superb. Antonio Banderas is a remarkable voice actor. His acting, and his comedic timing, combined with one incredible scene have made the film forever memorable.And that scene is the scene when the magic bean stalk grows. There are only a very few motion picture sequences in the history of cinema that are so beautiful, amazing and filled with spirit they touch you down to the toes. I was awe struck.We remember such cinematic and artistic genius in scenes from Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, Bambi, 2001's light show sequence and a very few other films that have gone on to become classics.The only film in the last five years that had such a stunning shot was in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, when we are flown onto the workshop floor where whole planets are being made. The scene pulls you in with such artistry and beauty that your jaw drops and you realize you are seeing something truly magical and wondrous.That is the best way to describe the scene in Puss In Boots when the main characters are caught up into the sky and playing among the clouds in that most remarkable sequence as the beanstalk shoots upward in graceful vines exploding lyrically with life. It is sure to become a part of motion picture legend, as legendary as the scene in Bambi when winter first arrives and Bambi and his friends play in the snow and on the ice; or the scene in Star Wars where we are whisked into hyperspace for the very first time, or the Millennium Falcon is pulled into the death star.The whole film is just great. But this is the greatest moment and nails the entire film as a contender for becoming a classic.",10,11,12,5 November 2011
Saving Mr. Banks," An excellent film on many levels
","Saving Mr. Banks, about the dynamics behind the making of the film Mary Poppins, is Hollywood at its best: people with hardships in their past overcome them through their collaborative art; something creative, sweet, perhaps syrupy, but always honest, and with integrity. It was a wonderful choice to pick the co-author and consummate actress of Nanny McPhee, Emma Thompson, for the role of Travers. We see the hardships in Walt's own past, that of Mrs. Travers, and a couple of other key characters: one of the song writers injured in the war, and the limo chauffeur who loves his handicapped daughter (this film's unseen Tiny Tim). And all of these Snow White Dwarf characters, innocent and childlike, except Mrs. Travers, carry this syrupy hope and optimism. The same that her father carried...which may have led to his death. Or was it the one thing carrying him as long as it could? In grief over losing him, she has written a beautiful book, but herself become a living Ebenezer Scrooge.In this American version of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol', Walt Disney is the living Ghost of Christmas Present. Walt reveals that he knows the perfunctory and scrooge practicality of Mrs. Travers belies such dreamy hopes she herself carries, and always has since childhood, writing about a magical savior nanny who flies in on the wind and an umbrella. Walt later discovers Mary Poppins is all about her lost relationship with her deeply beloved father, and Walt works subtly to reconnect her to the very childlike nature of her father whose death she has still not come to terms with. He tells her that this film, Mary Poppins, will be a way for her to come to terms with honor.Mrs. Travers discovers that Disney is indeed integrating these truths seamlessly, and has done so all along. We are all children, after all, and our happiness depends upon remembering and honoring that. He is far from fluff. There is more gravitas in that ride on the merry go round than Mrs. Travers understands at the time. And then she realizes that everyone on this project, even the secretary bringing a feast of syrupy and colorful sweets every day into the office, everyone who works for Disney is in the same boat she is, finding meaning and expression by turning personal difficulty into a positive creation. And that self-knowledge, that personal wisdom makes the folks at Disney able to accomplish miracles while showing remarkable tolerance and encouragement to each other. Disney was not all slapstick cartoons, talking animals and smiles. A year before releasing Mary Poppins, in 1963, Disney released The Three Lives of Tomasina, a film that touches on death, mysticism, spirituality, re- birth and the love between father and daughter that in grief can become a neurosis. Disney always had deeper intent and content. Same with Darby o'Gill released by Disney in 1959. Even Bambi and Dumbo, dealing with abandonment, death, and the difficulties of grief and separation, the emotional wounds of being orphaned. And 20,000 leagues Under the Sea in 1954. The portrayal of a genius captain's murderous rampage; self- destructive insanity and his obsession with his lost wife honored Edgar Allen Poe as much or more than Jules Verne. These films are nothing close to Mrs. Travers' prejudice about Mr. Disney's work. It was Mrs. Travers' superficial view that was mistaken. And that was the product of her own self- denial.Mrs. Travers, while watching Mary Poppins, cries at points, but she also still cringes at others. She is still Mrs. Travers. We see the genius of Disney: his work reflects the best of very different professionals, and a deeper spirituality. Hanks does a nice, layered job. He portrays Disney the savvy business leader and manager. But there is still much more to tell. An entire film could be made of Walt's role leading the way to the Monorail, an engineering feat unprecedented in America and only faintly recognized, for it remains too far ahead of its time. Walt had his own engineers at the Burbank studios design most of it, successfully, working with a basic concept from Sweden, fighting the clock to meet deadlines. He turned a concept into an actual reality through brilliant engineering and leadership. The first monorail in America. Walt was far more than a film maker. City planners today use Disneyland and Walt Disney World as a model for the ideal urban community. Walt didn't plan these places as theme parks. His entire vision was to use them as living models of ideal communities. Visiting either park was to be a subtle education, and has proved to be so.One day that film will contrast Walt walking as an eight year old boy through the snow at his father's command with the adult Walt obsessed with innovations in public transportation, the ergonomics of technology, and the design of Utopian communities. Steve Jobs, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg all from California, are childhood students of and adult contributors to Disney's vision.And of coarse, the better known struggles to get Snow White to screen, and Fantasia, both requiring incredible personal risks, technical genius, leadership, sentiment and teamwork. An entire motion picture could be made of either of these remarkable personal and professional journeys of achievement.I will never forget, as a seven year old boy visiting the Monsanto Home of the Future at Disneyland in 1964, designed largely by Disney and his own crew of engineers. Sitting on the coffee table, without being mentioned by the tour guide, was a wireless picture phone in a small flat rectangular shape, probably three inches by five inches, looking just like today's smart phone. Spooky.We are all still trying to live up to Walt's vision, each in our own way.",9,9,13,24 May 2014
