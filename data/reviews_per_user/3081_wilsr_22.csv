First Man," I managed to stay to the end. Do I get a medal?
","'Testament', 'Visceral', 'Powerful', 'Breathtaking'. Just some of the words used by the professional critics' reviews.
I obviously saw a different movie. No, I checked the date and cast: it was the same one.
I have debated with myself as to whether this was the worst film I have ever seen, and came to the conclusion that possibly 'Four Lions' just edged into that slot - but it is a very close thing.
Let's get the technical aspects out of the way first. The sound is dreadful, and not helped by the appalling diction of many of the cast. Nor by the overwhelming soundtrack, which dominates and destroys the visuals. The constant use of tight closeups combined with the lighting and what appears to be aout of focus effects make following the action not an easy task.
Gosling plays Gosling: he shows several expressions none of which have much relevance to the narrative and left this viewer emotionally detached from the story. Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife made a competent fist of her part but no-one stood out in any way.
Now to the main problem, and it comes down to appalling direction. It is not a well constructed movie in several ways.
Firstly, it is far too long. There are multiple examples of scenes so drawn out they become self parodies, and show self indulgence. One wonders if the shots cost so much to set up every foot just had to be used?
And, oh! the cliches! Just because one film uses hand-held camerawork to put the audience in the middle of a war battle doesn't mean that it is mandatory to use the technique at all times: it detracts from the story and becomes so irritating that the viewer loses the will to live. Then there's the meeting after the return - which was never shown or hinted at despite being arguably the most critical part of the mission - of Neil and wife in the quarantine room, separated by a glass wall: i actually sat there waiting for the inevitable placing of hands on each side of the glass.
Casting is always the most important part of a movie's birth, and especially so when attempting portrayal of current or within living memory events as docu-drama. The only character who had even a fleeting resemblance to his real life alter ego was Mike Collins, who of course stayed in lunar orbit. Compare that with the lead in Vice, where one wonders how they got Dick Cheyney back to play himself!
I don't really follow film directors very much, but on the DVD extras Chazelle comes over as immature and full of self importance: then my wife told me that he also directed La La land (which I haven't seen) and she could only stay watching that for twenty minutes before leaving the cinema. I can see what she meant.
The story of Neil Armstrong, Buss Aldrin and Mike Collins - and the thousands of designers, engineers, technicians, mathematicians etc who made Apollo complete its mission - is etched in everyone's minds who watched the project from Mercury, through Gemini , Apollo, the ISS and shuttle. The mindblowing complexities of making and guiding spacecraft deserve a much much better portrayal than this feeble attempt which makes the whole thing seem little more than strapping in and turning the ignition key. Yes, it is attempting to show the mind of Armstrong as much as the mechanics, but I'm afraid that, for this reviewer, it fails miserably at both.",1,4,8,1 February 2019
Star Trek," Very disappointing
","After all the hype I found this movie disappointing. So much so that I left about ten minutes before the end.Thinking about it, I suspect the reason is that the original Star Trek TV series rose above the slightly shonky sets, KMart uniforms and balsa model animations because of the concepts 'debated' in the episodes. Chain of command, captains' responsibilities and so on made what was a pretty run-of-the-mill series into something worth wondering about.Now we have breathtaking effects and CGI battles, bangs and the like. (Except the transporter effects - how come the TV transporters looked as if they worked while this film appeared as if they'd been drawn in by a toddler?) But I think these effects were the downfall of the film. I got the distinct impression that they sat down and worked out how to make the bangs louder, the explosions explosier and the black holes holier - and then looked at each other and said 'now how are we going to tie all those effects together? D'you think we need some sort of story line? Howsabout if .......Five out of ten - for the bangs!",5,20,49,12 May 2009
Passengers," Pretty good if you just accept the many scientific goofs
","This is definitely one of the better SciFi movies, on several counts. Firstly, the CGI is spectacularly good even by today's high standards. I watched the movie on a (clear and sharp) inflight video screen and the effects were excellent: I must see it again on a big screen. Secondly, although there are a few wham bang scenes, they are thankfully few and far between: far too many movies now rely on destroying things in massive explosions rather than good plotting and dialogue. Thirdly - and most importantly, the script gives the audience something to think about: the ethical dilemma of Jim, the sole awakened passenger on an interstellar ship as he agonises whether to cut short the hibernation of the beautiful Aurora. He longs for company and, hopefully, 'company' - Arthur the bartender isn't quite the same. Despite the scientific advisors the producers must have employed there are many goofs plainly visible (the 'Goofs' section here brings up a large number) but IMO they don't spoil the movie to a great extent except towards the end. At about the halfway point the movie seems to stray away from thoughtful analysis of Jim's dilemma and comes close to being wham bang (See above.) One of the most notable scenes is where gravity disappears: it is a stunning mix of live action and CGI - and also one containing a large number of scientific goofs, not that this spoils the effect. The ending is, I think, the worst part of this movie. Hollywood likes a happy ending so, despite Jim's death in space (a pretty unequivocal passing, given the extent of his exposure to heat, radiation, anoxia and cryogenic temperatures!) he is miraculously resurrected in a truly biblical fashion. Shortly afterwards - in movie terms, if not relativistic - the film ends rather as if the editors had been given a deadline. A continuation of the more thoughtful first half would have had him die and stay dead: the final scene might have shown Aurora herself facing the same dilemma about waking a good looking guy to provide company - and 'company'. Fade to black/credits....... 8/10 but still a good watch.",8,1,2,12 April 2017
Elizabeth," Almost Bollywood.
","Why this movie should have had nominations escapes me.Let me tell you where I am coming from. I have just finished watching the full day-and-a-half series 'The Tudors' on DVD - which ends as Bloody Mary becomes queen. So it was logical to watch 'Elizabeth' on DVD as a follow-on.Others have commented on the historical inaccuracies (which were also evident to some extent in The Tudors) so I won't labour the point. It does, however, make me just a little leery when films use history as narrative as opposed to merely a period backdrop and present scenes of historical significance as fact. I can accept liberties taken with unimportant scenes but there's enough drama in the known facts to make a gripping movie without embellishment.Now to the film. There is some fine acting here, especially Rush. Queen Anne is in my opinion miscast. Ms Winslet, although looking the part, just doesn't cut it though: she projects as if she is on a West End stage production. Much more subtlety needed.My biggest criticism lies with the director, Kapur. There are one or two visually stunning sequences - the water party comes to mind. The cinematography is excellent throughout, the sound better than seems to be the norm nowadays (with the exception of using Elgar in one sequence, at funereal speed) and the sets and locations believable. But unfortunately the whole is spoiled by the director's constant infusion of 'Art' with a capital 'A'.Fades to overexposed white. Soft focus. Incessant slow pans and zooms. Very few of these cinematic tricks are necessary in such a story, and neither are many of the dancing scenes. The overall effect, for me, is of a Bollywood extravaganza transposed into a 16th Century setting. It is almost comical, and reminiscent of those TV take-offs of blockbuster movies, with everything exaggerated to extremes.One particular sequence, with Ms Winslet overacting her way through a staccato series of practices of her forthcoming speech, made me check that the DVD hadn't inadvertently switched to the 'Out-takes' extra.Shame: a period of English history that perhaps more than any other shaped the path to modern society could, and should, have been better presented. Not as documentary, but certainly less as a director's statement.",3,1,4,4 February 2011
Hot Fuzz," Not funny, too long
","Yes, I DO get the intention is to send up the shoot-out cop movies, and I DO get the references within the script.But a take-off of a genre has to add something to be successful: merely making the bangs bigger, the blood gorier and the juxtaposition of English Heritage and Downtown LA isn't enough.I saw Hot Fuzz in the cinema soon after it was released and remember thinking it overlong and not particularly funny. I have just reviewed 'Paul' - also a Pegg and Frost movie - and thought I'd better watch HF again to make sure that I haven't missed anything. So I sat through the whole thing on DVD - and no, I don't think that I *have* missed anything. Including the intended point.When I say 'sat through' I mean just that. I have to say that I didn't even smile once.I suppose - especially seeing the vast majority of the reviews are positive - that I am being over critical. After all, the casting is excellent. The acting is first class. The blood looks realistic, not too Kensington Gore-y. It somehow doesn't gel though: the exaggeration of the Hollywood stereotype in the English village isn't enough to make a take-off movie work.The camera-work doesn't help, either: a miscalculation by the director.If I had to sum Hot Fuzz up, I would say that it almost mocks itself without putting an extra edge into the mix, an edge that might have saved a good idea from being an overlong, extended sketch.",1,16,47,24 April 2011
Interstellar," A truly awful movie, stunningly bad.
","Thanks are due to Singapore Air, who put an end to my utter boredom when the aircraft landed and the videos were switched off, towards the end of the scene in what I suppose was some sort of matrix.I mention this because the fact that it was viewed on a 17' screen with noise cancelling headphones on might be relevant, although I don't think so.One line in this dreadful attempt at an epic sticks in my memory: 'This data makes no sense'. (Ignore the grammar). Correct: very little of this movie makes any sense at all. The characters are hardly defined, the plot - if indeed there is one - is so incoherent that it left me angry, the track is numbingly monotonous and overwhelms much of the dialogue and the 'science' (my quotes) is infantile.If the makers of the movie (and I say makers because the director is only one of the guilty, albeit the one accountable) had any inkling as to where the storyline was going, I do wish they had taken the trouble to share the information, because frankly I hadn't a clue. Perhaps I was too engaged with counting the constant barrage of laughable improbabilities to follow the flashbacks and flashforwards.A film attempting to explain such things as time relativity and black holes to the uninitiated needs to use the concepts in a logical way. Falling back again and again on fantasy rather than developing the sci-fi theme is the sign of a failure of imagination, not the reverse.You will notice that I make no mention of the cgi or use of stunts: good or bad they cannot rescue a dog of a storyline. I felt zero connection with any of the characters because none showed any sort of believability. A long retired astronaut cum farmer gets into a spaceship and immediately knows its systems? The ship itself is built, hidden from the world, by a handful of people? A robot made of chunky blocks can manipulate switches let alone run around on and in water and ice? Etcetera etcetera. Please.....Again, thanks to the airline for saving me the ten bucks that I was actually looking forward to spending at the cinema, having read the glowing critics' reviews of this movie.",1,5,12,11 April 2015
Fargo," Brilliantly conceived and (joke) executed.
","The storyline of this dark comedy drama has been gone over many times in other reviews so I won't labour on about it.Suffice it to say that the overwhelming feeling of biting cold creeping into every part of the characters' bodies is brilliantly expressed. The multiple killings are leavened with a homely - Minnesotan - humour that somehow brings the whole movie together in a way that is typically Coen Bros.The actors worked with dialect tutors to perfect the Minnesota accent to such effect that some of the dialogue is quite difficult to follow yet, strangely, this doesn't matter. The laconic way of talking interacts with the stark landscapes and reinforces the coldness which is so much an integral part of the movie.The acting is almost consistently excellent: my one reservation is William H Macy's portrayal of the lead (anti)hero which to me just slightly off the mark in one or two scenes: I couldn't put my finger on why I felt that way and it isn't a real criticism of the movie as a whole.Bottom line: first class, a movie to watch again and again (As I have!)",10,1,2,13 April 2011
21," Not great cinema, but nevertheless a couple of hours' entertainment
","I think many of the reviews here are missing the point: I know nothing about betting on cards but, even if I did I would not be over-critical about the fidelity of the casino operations.It's fiction, folks: the idea behind the film might have been based on actual happenings but - it's still fiction.I'm a fairly hard marker about movies that rely on whiz-kid CGI and wanton destruction of expensive cars rather than sound screenplays but in this case I personally watched a presentable film, well acted and with a halfway believable plot line. OK, some of the situations were, as previously mentioned, a little set-up, but on the whole the inconsistencies didn't spoil my enjoyment.Spacey is, in my book, one of the best and most natural actors working at present. He, and Fishburne, give excellent performances here. Spacey's handling of a controlling and mendacious lecturer is one of his best efforts.It was a little disappointing that the old chase-through-the-kitchens scenario was hauled out yet again, but the way the finale came round again to the Harvard Med school interview to round the movie off was, I thought, a nice touch. Not, to be sure, a ten-Oscar contender but one hell of a lot better to pass the afternoon with than Inception or some of the other pretentious pseudo-intellectual rubbish that is shoved at us nowadays.",7,1,1,1 January 2011
Disturbia," Hip teens bore me
","I feel a fraud giving this movie any star rating since I couldn't watch it beyond the point where the girl next door is sitting on the roof reading.Teen acting is something that takes a lot of skill to avoid the hip-hop appearance of immaturity, and I didn't see that here. The far-too-many-repeats Ferris Bueller just managed the trick and makes a decently entertaining film. The difference between the two is stark, even though the 'teens foxing the adults' theme is superficially the same.I just don't have the patience to waste my time on teen angst movies - and this one (the bit I sat through) is a stunningly boring example of that.) Anyone who gave this more than three stars - please get out more.",1,4,6,7 March 2010
Being John Malkovich," The DVD extra tells it all
","What on earth does floor 7.5 have to do with anything? Not a bad idea, but tails off into navel-gazing and with no sense of direction or ending.Weird does not equate to worthwhile.I bought the DVD because I'd seen a small bit of the movie on TV, and thought it looked interesting. However:The extra on the DVD - the 'interview' with the so-called director - says it all. He pretends to be suffering a gigantic hangover, pretends to vomit outside his car and that's it.Not alternative comedy - just alternative...........I gave it 3 stars for trying: god knows why.",3,1,4,3 January 2009
Dunkirk," How can a film this bad be financed?
","I was delighted when I finally tracked down a Bluray version of Dunkirk: it is a movie I had been waiting to see since it was released.
What a disappointment: no, disappointment is too weak a word. Disgust is more appropriate. Disgust with myself for being taken in by the professional reviews and especially for wasting 1hr 46m of my life.
The cinematography is superb - some of the best I have seen. There - that's it: everything else is truly awful.
The dialogue is barely understandable. The background music - why have background music anyway? - is unremittingly dreary, banal and mindbendingly tedious. Much of the acting could have been panned by an audience at the village amateur dramatic pantomime.
The only reason I could thing of that the discombobulated storyline - if indeed there is one - is so was an intention to display the disorientation and terror war produces. It doesn't actually do this: the total lack of narrative in any meaningful sense firstly irritates and then engenders a fury at the waste of time and money represented by making this monstrosity.
Because of the way the film has been envisaged and constructed, without any character development I found I had absolutely no connection with the people in it, and no empathy either. Nolan may have wanted to show various soldiers in the same situation, but as a plan it just doesn't work.
Comic relief is provided at times: a spitfire with a dead prop glides at various heights for an eternity, even with flaps down. Bullet holes appear in the hull of the ship in groupings that would win medals in the local firing range.Branagh displays several varieties of facial rictus straight out of Python. And so on.
And NOTHING - not even a mention - of the War office decision making, the on-the-fly planning and logistics which made the Dunkirk rescue of much of the army a 'success'.
You may ask - so what did I really think about this movie?",1,4,8,2 September 2018
Pearl Harbor," Oh, dear!
","Let's cut straight to the quick: four stars.Four stars because the (relatively) early CGI is not at all bad, if overstated. Live action is pretty realistically mixed with virtual, although the aerial shots do look a tad artificial. Anyway, four stars for that.Doesn't leave many stars for the rest though, does it? At three hours, this movie is at least 50% too long. It doesn't know where it's going - and it shows. If you just watched the first twenty minutes you could be forgiven in thinking it is a comedy, rather crudely done. The last half hour, the Doolittle raid sequence, is pure jingoistic make-believe. Then there's the middle bit: the raid on Pearl - and that doesn't start until nearly an hour and a half into the romantic comedy. Discombobulated is, I think, the appropriate designation.I valiantly resisted seeing this film for years after reading how tedious it is in many reviews, but succumbed (this is 2012) and sat through the TV performance right through to the end.I am uncomfortable with movies that are fiction dressed up with a strong historical theme. The blurring of fact and fiction is always an invitation to re-write history or, at least, be taken as fact by those who are unable to make the distinction. WW2 is recent enough to be well documented, and a movie such as Pearl Harbor does itself no favours by weaving a completely fictitious story into actual historical fact.The really interesting story from a factual point of view was the failure of the intelligence services in the Pearl Harbour attack: this would itself have made a great movie but was hardly touched upon. As with Bletchley Park, much of the wins and losses in war are enacted behind the scenes and in secrecy.And the music track - atrocious!Sorry, but this falls into the same box as Independence Day - a jingoistic yawn. A wasted opportunity.",4,1,2,15 July 2012
Quantum of Solace," Unwatchable
","I managed about ten minutes of this movie, and that was quite enough.The editing makes it, for me, completely unwatchable. The cutting is more frenetic than any film I have ever seen before and after the first couple of minutes my brain had been battered into 'please let me die' mode.There really is nothing clever or innovative about such a pace: I suspect the editors were brought up on cut/cut/cut videos and imagine that this 'technique' (being polite) makes a story exciting.News for them: it doesn't in commercials, and it sure doesn't in a full length movie. Grow up and learn to make a story stand up for itself without this sort of activity.",1,18,26,12 March 2014
No Country for Old Men," Superb!
","I have just amused myself reading through the (long) list of goofs. Fortunately none of them spoiled this, exceptional, movie for me! The Coen Bros excel in working the landscape into their films. Both in Fargo and No Country the vast expanses dominate the characters, but without dominating the film. Contrast that with Brokeback Mountain, where the outdoors overrode the story IMO to the extent it became a travelogue.Casting is so important in any film: even one actor looking out of place can spoil the whole exercise. Not here, though: each and every one looks and feels the part. Jones - a much under-appreciated actor - is simply superb. His long, pensive pauses are exquisitely delivered. Bordem is so quietly menacing you almost have to watch from behind the sofa: his psychopathic disinterest in his many slayings should be a part of every budding actor's course notes.I would never have placed Harrelson as a hit man in this sort of movie but he also plays the part as if he's been killing all his life, in a casual way. Brolin, too, knows the ranch life and that shows.It's so pleasant to see a modern day film made with a beginning, middle and .......end? Well, yes: that's the whole point - there IS no end to the drugs and the violence. The 'end' (which is really just the point where the movie itself stops, because the losing battle continues) has the killer limping off down a suburban street and the sheriff contemplating a quiet, definitely less stimulating, retirement. Fade to black.No question: NCFOM sets the gold standard for this genre.",10,3,4,25 April 2011
Bridesmaids," Don't waste your time
",".About four hours into this movie my wife said to me : 'Just how much longer does this go on?' OK, perhaps not four hours - it just felt like that.It impressed me how good the cinematography and lighting were, for an amateur movie. And that's what it seemed to be - an amateur attempt at humour.I'm the last person in the world to be thought straightlaced, but the constant use of asshole, bum, c*nt and the like doesn't of itself make a comedy. There has to be humour somewhere in there as well, not just shouting, grimacing and a shitload (to repeat a word used in this dire production a zillion times) of overacting.To be fair, there were in this two hours of misery one or two brief instances of near comedy: unfortunately I was so bored that I can't remember them accurately enough to give the timeline points so that you are able to skip the rest.A further thing - and this is not unique to Bridesmaids, but is becoming almost standard - is that so much of the dialogue is delivered in such clipped, drawled/back of the mouth Californian accents that I found only 30% of the lines were understandable. Diction now seems to be a forgotten art.I won't mention any cast names to avoid embarrassing them: suffice it to say that many of them must have been running short of scripts to have agreed to appear in this slow motion, infantile, disaster..",1,2,5,29 June 2012
The Hurt Locker," Not what I was expecting
","Nothing that I write here is any kind of comment on the actual military operation in Iraq, nor on those involved: it's purely reflections on the movie.I don't know what I was expecting except that the film was to do with IOD management in a war zone. It does, to my limited understanding of the subject, a reasonable job in that respect.What spoiled it for me was the almost comedic gung-ho attitude displayed by most of the soldiers and in particular the over-use of the hand held camera.The latter is a hobby horse of mine, but almost all the modern directors seem to be enthralled with this clichéd technique, usually in totally inappropriate movies.Hand held camera-work has its place - and that place is when the story is being told as if from the viewpoint of, for example, a news cameraman in a firefight. It gives authenticity to the sequences. All too often it is used indiscriminately in films that have absolutely no use for it, and is merely irritating.(I was going to see Captain Phillips last week, until I saw a review that mentioned the director's signature hand held camera-work - I decided to give it a miss.)The ironic thing about the Hurt Locker is that it is just the sort of story that IS appropriate for the technique. The trouble is that it is completely over the top: the shots are often so deliberately jerky that I was thinking more of my irritation than following the storyline.It's a valid technique that is so often got wrong, in so many ways. Pity..",7,1,2,18 December 2013
Avatar," What a waste...
","I am not going to give Avatar a star rating: a movie so technically excellent, and so banal in plot, acting and dialogue just cannot be reduced to one, five or ten stars.Few would argue that the CGI and the relatively restrained use of 3D make this movie a landmark: Cameron's use of computer generated figures and sets in Titanic set a high standard for realism but Avatar takes the technology to a different level: give the film it's due. He resists the temptation to shove the action directly into the audiences' faces to show how impressive 3D can be. The generated forests are, literally, fantastic. The futuristic computer screens and control room sets have been created by people who know how to make these things appear believable. The CGI blue natives are less realistic, but still don't detract from the overall imagery. (One of the ironies of the present generation of CGI is that the closer the characters are to humans the more uncomfortable one is with the depiction - talking rat-chefs and Buzz Lightyears look more natural than computerised Shrek princesses - but that's by the bye.) (Some of the 3D cinematography is less effective than the rest: in particular, rapidly moving objects in the foreground move very jerkily, rather as if shot at such a low frame rate that the persistence of vision cannot blend the motion, and this make one a little vertiginous.) And yet.....Hundreds of millions have here been expended on the technology, years of work by talented artists and computer programmers have gone into realising the final film, but somewhere along the road - probably from conception - Cameron has lost the plot. And that's the problem - there really *isn't* one, at least not an original, 'make you think', plot. It's all been done before.OK, there are such ironies as the visual 9-11 reference, but the overall sense that I had was of a waste of all that incredible technology. That will become the norm, and will be further improved, but it can only be effective if it is draped around, and complements, original screen writing.The dialogue is often excruciating in its jingoism. Ms Weaver recites her lines monotonically, as if she's an infant auditioning for the Christmas Nativity play, and the gung-ho military men made me cringe with the clichés and their one dimensional personae. If - and it's big if - this jingoism is intentional and full of hidden meaning, it's a huge mistake. Imagine,if you will, this movie as a DVD on your LCD screen at home, no 3D and without the beautiful landscapes and floating mountains - could you really sit through 2½ hours of facile dialogue without falling asleep? I couldn't.So: would I pay to see it again? Yes, but not for a while and only in IMAX or big-screen 3D, and mainly to enjoy the scenery. Would I buy the DVD and watch it at home? No: without all that gorgeous scenery and the various CGGI effects I really couldn't be bothered. Will it generate a handful of awards? Very probably, and deservedly so for the imagery. But if Oscars are given for the screenplay or the acting it can only be because of bribery during the voting process.PS (Edited several days later):I have been reading many of the other reviews of this film and have to take exception to descriptions of it as 'science fiction'. It is not - it is 'fantasy'.SF - at least in the classical sense - takes a fundamental premise such as time travel or mind control, and builds a logical structure around it. Fantasy has no such limitation: it just keeps inventing more and more impossible layers and asks you to accept them without criticism. And that's the basic problem with Avatar's plotting and screenplay - it has no logical progression, and relies entirely on its admittedly stunning imagery.",Null,2,6,26 December 2009
Downfall," Almost faultless
","Downfall has to be one of the best movies ever made.I have just watched the DVD (which includes extensive extras about the making of the film, interviews and biographies of the subjects), which makes the third viewing for me. There are few movies that I care to see this many times.Small errors of continuity aside, the impressive attention to detail, the casting, the acting and direction, sets, cinematography, sound - everything about this movie is to me just about perfect. The fact that it was made for 13m is astonishing: many Hollywood movies with a fraction of this class would have shelled that out to the lead star.Casting such a story - the last few days of the Third Reich, mainly in the Berlin bunker to which Hitler and his coterie of believers retreated - presented a near-impossible task. Recent history, especially when so freely documented and photographed, allows only a small latitude with character portrayal: finding actors who so closely resembled the players such as Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and the rest and were capable of playing them so well has been brilliantly achieved.Much of the outdoor action was filmed in St Petersburg, Russia: a whole street was taken over for nine days and changed into wartorn Berlin to remarkable effect. The logistics behind this alone merit total admiration.In some ways it is remarkable that it has taken so long to bring this story to the screen in this genre, and it is a tribute to the German people that it came about at all. The decision not to dub an English track over the original German, but instead to provide subtitles, might be seen by some as incorrect: in many films this would be so, but here it is absolutely right. The full impact of the Fuhrer's ranting, his malevolent diatribes, can only be appreciated by listening to them in German, whether one speaks the language or not.If you haven't already seen this film, do yourself a favour and buy the DVD. If you *have* seen it - do yourself a favour and buy the DVD.(Edited, 31st Dec 2010: The proliferation of YouTube clips of the Fuhrer throwing his toys out of the pram shows how a truly awful monster can be laughed into history as an aberration in the human race.)",10,1,2,2 August 2010
Inception," The Emperor's new clothes?
","Inception has received almost unanimously good reviews in the press. So who am I to say, as an ordinary, paying member of the filmgoing public, that this movie is a dog? I have to qualify that - I left after the first hour or so (during the gunfight. Sorry, that's not very clear: during the yellow cab gunfight to distinguish it from all the other gunfights.) I really have better things to do with my time - even writing this.Back to the movie (or half of it, anyway.) Dreams within dreams within dreams don't have to be logical - I suppose they wouldn't be dreams if they were - but a story *should* be logical, or at least be capable of explanation. And this one isn't.From a screenplay point of view it just didn't hang together for me: the episodic nature of the story, such as it is, made no sense whatsoever. I realise that this was probably the intention and that presumably all would eventually become clear: it's just that I didn't have the intestinal fortitude to sit through to the end. Almost every utterance by the characters seemed to come out of thin air, with no relevance to anything else. The innumerable fights lost all meaning, and the undoubtedly clever GCI effects appeared to me to be the sole reason for making the film in the first place.'Hey, let's make a movie with CGI better than Avatar! Those effects will be great! Can we build a storyline around them?....'. Sorry, the effects *are* good (even if nothing like as stunning those in Avatar), but the complete lack of a halfway believable plot line just doesn't cut it for me.As others have said, the soundtrack didn't help: muffled dialogue and loud, pretentious music don't mix. But then again, who cares? The dialogue was truly, mindbendingly, banal.Sir Michael: you don't need the money, do you? Please use a little discrimination when accepting roles!Two out of ten - it would probably be one out of ten if I had been able to stick it to the end.(Edited: After I had posted this I looked for the first time at others' reviews, and noticed that Dylan - 24th July - has used exactly the same summary as I. There must be a clue there?)",2,4,10,26 July 2010
Moon," Drivel
","I am a fan of SciFi but this dog leaves me stunned that other reviews give it a fair to good rating. I missed it in the local cinema but bought the DVD - which turned out to be a disappointment quite apart from the film itself. (It first of all just played 'snow' and the special features refuse to run. Shame that - they might have thrown some light on the plot....) Obviously a low budget movie, the constant jump cuts, shonky outfits and wobbly computers could be forgiven if the story warranted it. I don't think I am particularly thick, but the long, drawn out sequences of a moon rover approaching various stations, the haphazard editing and the way the scenes are manipulated so as to get the same actor in the one shot made it a real effort to keep watching.The final straw for me is the really terrible diction of the various Sams - the mumbling delivery meant I could not follow much of the dialogue. That certainly didn't help understanding what the hell was going on - not that it mattered, since I lost interest halfway through.Oscars? Please don't go on - I'll split my sides!",1,14,45,15 February 2010
Valkyrie," Bearable
","I find it difficult to review this movie. It appears neither faction nor drama.The creators obviously debated whether to use natural English or ''Allo 'Allo' German accents, and on balance I think they made the wrong decision. For an English speaking audience, English spoken with a German accent is far more believable than a ragbag of differing English / American speech.Casting is one of the most important aspects of any film, and here again I don't think it has been well done. Cruise, of course, is Cruise. Nighty is Nighty. And so on. 'Downfall' was such a brilliant success because of the utterly believable casting (as well as the brilliance of the Fuhrer's portrayal). But in Valkyrie, none of the characters is developed: they are actors . The tensions that arose because of the doubt that the plot might succeed are shown - but not developed sufficiently to make you care.The flashbacks and flashforwards don't do anything for the structure of the film, and if anything make it a little confusing.The dialogue wasn't helped by rather poor sound mixing: I found some of it quite difficult to follow - but then the picture quality wasn't very good either so it may have been a digital projection problem.I usually rate a movie personally as to whether I will buy the DVD so that I can watch it every year or two. On balance I might - but only when the price comes down to the rental value.Not a real clunker, but - frustratingly - missing just too many critical ingredients.",5,4,9,28 January 2009
Up in the Air," Adequate
","First: the good news.Sound: good. Cinematography: good. Direction: good. Acting: good.However.....A reasonable idea for a plot - quite unlike anything else I've seen (which has to be a plus point, as so many films now are merely reheated yesterdays' dinners.) But the idea doesn't really *go* anywhere, at least not for the majority of the 109 minutes. Now, some movies can take this - and may in fact have the ennui as part of the atmosphere - but I don't think this is one of them.Two possible endings were signposted loud and clear within the first fifteen minutes. Either Ryan was going to get the heave-ho himself (probably by his young trainee) or he was going to 'find' himself and his lack of a real life, and realise that he was more comfortable chasing air miles.So the only thing that kept this viewer in the cinema was wondering which ending was going to eventuate, or whether there was going to be a subtle twist at the end. It's not a spoiler to disclose that no, there *was* no subtle twist at the end! Having got all that off my chest I have to admit that I found 'Up in the air' reasonably watchable in an inoffensive sort of way. As another reviewer has said, there are really two or three different stories here: however they are not woven together as sub-plots which is how a great movie, or book, maintains a hold on the audience. They are merely different strands of the story.5/10 for me: easy enough, wouldn't see it a second time, wouldn't buy the DVD and, if asked, wouldn't put my vote in the Oscar box",5,12,23,8 February 2010
