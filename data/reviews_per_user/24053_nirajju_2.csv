Ford v Ferrari," A historic story told with pace & panache
","Cristian Bale puts his method acting to perfection, getting inside the character of the talented race driver Miles. While Matt puts in a sophisticated performance as a racer-turned-businessman, it is Bale who rules the little-longer-than-needed film time. The characters have been drawn out beautifully in the early part of the movie & the crux of the Ford vs Ferrari rivalry hits the peak during the climax. A special mention goes out to the child actor who portrays Miles' kid for betraying the innocence & excitement of the racing phenomena which swept the early 60s. If you enjoyed Ron Howard's Rush for the personal rivalry of James Hunt vs Nicki Lauda, you should definitely watch out as the giants Automobiles lock horns through the amazing driving skills of its racers. Go for the film in IMAX or 4DX wherever possible, and you would find the time just zip past you.",8,2,3,8 December 2019
First Man," First Class but tad short of Outstanding
","On the Golden jubilee of the Giant Leap, I feeling nothing less than proud of mankind's achievement of something 50 years ago! Everything could have gone wrong with the mission, yet everything turned out to be right on the fateful day. Now talking about the movie, I feel it could have explored the dynamics between Armstrong & Aldrin since both were risking it together. It appeared as if NASA had put two strangers (actually three) into the cockpit which really wouldn't be the case. The humane side of Armstrong has been depicted well by Gosling & given that the movie is about 'First Man', it is going to be biased about Neil anyway. Even though I watched Gravity (which seemed too gimmicky & an unnecessary Clooney), this is a better watch.",8,1,3,10 March 2019
