The Blair Witch Project," Not Scary, But Definitely Intriguing
","First of all, let me say I did NOT find this film scary. A few kids in the woods jumping around when they hear noises does not send me shrieking to the concession counter for something to calm my nerves. This film is definitely tense, grating and suspenseful, but not scary. The problem is, of course, that the premise is nonsensical. Those of us over 7, who realize witches do not exist outside campus sororities, will not be alarmed at a few tree branches rustling outside a tent.On the other hand, your girlfriend will probably go bananas watching this film. Five minutes of tension and she'll be clinging to you like you're the last donut at a policeman's ball. (That might not be a bad thing...)Despite the inherent silliness of the plot, top marks go to Heather Donahue. Not since Pamela Lee's plastic surgeon has anyone done do much with so little. Donahue is an incredibly talented actress, who deserves to win an Oscar for this role (yes, you read right..she's that good) and she would, if the Academy didn't keep dishing out the hardware for drivel like 'Shakespeare in Love.'In conclusion, do see this film. Ignore the jiggly camera, the bizarre lenswork and the overacting of Heather's male co-stars. Introduce yourself to Miss Donahue. This lady is something special.",Null,1,2,6 August 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," One Thing I Hate About You is Your Lack of Originality
","Let me preface my comments by saying I enjoyed this movie. It was definitely cute, fun and at one point, side-splitting hilarious. The big problem I have, though, is that it follows the IDENTICAL (aargh!) template to every other teen film ever made, campy Shakepeare references notwithstanding. I must admit I'm getting a wee bit tired of seeing a social outcast having to be convinced to go to the prom/dance/house party (She's All That, Carrie 2) where she can find out she was just a bet (She's All That, Cruel Intentions, Carrie 2), although the striptease on the kitchen table is indeed a new wrinkle. Please, stop putting grunge chicks on the screen and trying to convince me they're the ultimate sex symbols (Carrie 2, The Craft, The Faculty). I already know that. Cease and desist with the nerd wins babe routine (Can't Buy Me Love, The Faculty). I've tried it, it doesn't work.Couldn't Touchstone, with their oodles of dough, have given us something the least bit creative? That said, I refer you to my opening sentence and tell you I plan to see this flick at least twice more, if only to try and get a glimpse of what Julia Stiles is flashing.",10,1,2,1 April 1999
Notting Hill," Fall in love with Julia, for the first time
","As my many ex-girlfriends will testify, on the surface 'Notting Hill' does not appear to be my type of movie. Cars do not explode, female co-stars do not kiss and nobody says 'Do I make you horny, baby?' in a British accent. In fact, I fully expected to be 'notting off' within the first five minutes.However, when I actually worked up the courage to hand over my free admission coupon at the box office, I was pleasantly surprised by what I found. Granted, this is no 'BASEketball'--if you're looking for an in-depth exploration of human relationships, 'Notting Hill' isn't your movie. But if you just want a pleasant little film that will make you smile, chuckle and feel warm fuzzies all over (or maybe that was just an allergic reaction to the upholstery), this is it.What surprised me most was the sensitive, sweet (and watchable!) performance by Julia Roberts. After her array of sappy roles, I expected Julia to annoy the daylights out of me, but instead found myself won over by her sincerity. And as always, Hugh Grant was at once charming, funny and winsome.I was amazed by how well Julia and Hugh worked together in a relief role (the original casting was to be myself and Leelee Sobieski, but evidently my salary demands were too much). Let's hope we see more of this fantastic pairing in the future.",Null,0,0,21 June 1999
American Pie," This American Pie Makes Me Glad I'm Canadian
","The latest in the series of inane food product movies (following 'Canadian Bacon'), 'American Pie' will leave you feeling like you've been smacked in the face with one. Universal Studios took a poorly-written, typical teen script and made it worse with hideous casting and lousy directing.'American Pie' is a sadistic, mocking film that seems to savor the pain it is causing the theatregoing public, many of whom have been dragged to the multiplex by their dates. The humour is definitely of the New York City sewer variety, and this film's creators seem to be in a competition to outdo the morons who made 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Big Daddy' in terms of crudeness.This might just be a simple sleazefest if it were not for the absolutely hideous choice of actors. Trust me--these clowns make the brats at 'South Park' look sensitive and deep. Natasha Lyonne, with her hair looking like she just stuck a finger in a light socket, and her whiny 'I'm a goddess' performance leaving you wishing she had. Chris Klein, who was only cast in this film because the producers couldn't come to contract terms with a potted plant. Chris Owen, who is only suited for silent cameos, is given a speaking part. (Aaargh!) Alyson Hannigan, whose character swings wildly between slut and sweetie, is obviously way in over her head. And is it just me, or is the viewing public weary of hearing Tara Reid philosophize about oral sex? To make matters worse, we actually have to watch her head bobbing around as she performs it! Should we be forcing teenagers to watch such a disturbing visual image? It could turn them off sex forever.The best line of the movie--and the one you'll be repeating as you gaze into your wallet after the movie--is the one uttered by the jock when he wakes up in bed alone: 'I was used!'",Null,0,0,6 July 1999
The Piano," Absolutely Appalling
","It's just heartbreaking that any film studio would waste valuable resources on producing such a rotten, ill-conceived film. 'The Piano' is pathetic, anti-male drivel that suffers from a shoddy script and horrific acting. I still can't believe Anna Paquin won an Oscar for her shrieky, annoying performance. Holly Hunter is grating and aggravating, not convincing. The androphobic tone of the film is truly disconcerting--the overall effect is about as uplifting as a Gloria Steinem tract. At least the title is appropriate--watching this, you'll be praying for a Steinway to fall on you and end your misery.",Null,4,9,2 March 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," The Disaster Movie of 1999
","It's little wonder that such incredible secrecy surrounded 'Eyes Wide Shut' before it opened. Had anyone known anything about this film, they would have been able to avoid it. Unfortunately for us all, millions of well-intentioned souls (including myself) went to the multiplex wondering what the fuss was about and ended up getting burned.The billing that this is a Stanley Kubrick picture is a major misnomer. Anyone who's seen other Kubrick work will agree this is an AWFUL letdown and a horrible end to a fine career. A fifth grader with a camcorder and a piano (that constant one-note in the soundtrack was very annoying) could have produced this film--in fact, could have produced a much finer piece of cinema.The major problem with the film, as you will agree, is Nicole Kidman. The first image we see in the movie is Kidman's naked posterior, and the camera basically pans over her semi-nude frame the entire two and a half hours. There really isn't a moment in the movie when Kidman's nipples (cute, I must admit) aren't on display. My question is: if Nicole wanted so badly to display her body to the public, why didn't she just make a home video like Pamela Lee? The acting in the Lee family video was more heartfelt and honest than anything in 'Eyes Wide Shut.''Eyes Wide Shut' is the cinematic equivalent of sitting at a bus station, watching people come and go. Scores of potentially interesting people walk onscreen in the film, but they are never around long enough for us to find out anything about them. Instead, we are treated to Nicole as pothead, Nicole as pinup girl, Nicole laughing hysterically, schoolmarmish Nicole eating breakfast.The 'brain trust' (I use that term loosely) behind this movie obviously intended it as a touching exploration of the issues of honesty, trust, fidelity and sexuality. Unfortunately, that could never be accomplished with this cast of characters--there is not a single likable soul in this film. The aforementioned Nicole, Dr. Tom (would you trust your health to a guy who smokes pot and tries to sleep with hookers?), the creepy business types who serve as foils for Tom in an effort to make him look noble, and a completely pointless cameo by Leelee Sobieski in bra and panties that sends the movie on a totally unrelated tangent. (Are her boobs really that small?) It all adds up to two and a half hours of confusion, agitation and frustration for the moviegoer.",Null,0,0,20 July 1999
