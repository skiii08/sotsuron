The King's Speech," Captivating film with great performances
","Firth seizes you from the first shot itself and his performance is the driving force that makes this a captivating watch. The camera used to juxtapose his emotions and the period setting makes up the right atmosphere for this historical drama. Though some historical inaccuracies might have been avoided it doesn't deserve the hate it gets for all the accolades it got. People should accept that after all, no jury can be satisfying to everyone and move on without being a prick about these things all the time.",9,0,0,7 December 2017
First Man," Everything around the event
","A biopic about one of the most famous man of the 20th-century focusing on everything that is not so famous about him and it's done brilliantly. This shows how important every single detail is for one man's journey to such a monumental task and it's not that particular event itself that makes it an interesting story but everything that happens around it. The reality, danger and how it affects people around it.",9,1,3,21 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," As good as the original trilogy if not better
","Almost as good if not better than the original trilogy, fanboys can never be satisfied unless it's a cheap rehash of the original (The Force Awakens). Through dazzling visual effects for the time expanding the universe and including some of the best action scenes in the franchise till then, this is a thoroughly entertaining film. It does have a lot of flaws but none more than the original trilogy had, just different, fanboys ought to grow up.",8,3,4,17 December 2017
It," Upgraded but not necessarily better
","IT uses all the conventional horror elements in perfect harmony with King's novel's parts dealing with the kids. An upgrade from the cheesy 1990 TV version but even with the help of the most modern technology, it's the core story of King that shines above all. The whole cast of kids did a fantastic job and the backstories were also solid. But it feels kind of incomplete without the next chapter releasing in 2019. The overuse of jump-scares and CGI monsters is a bit tiring where more mysterious approach may have worked better.",6,0,2,21 November 2017
Detroit," Intense, one of the best films of the year
","An intense edge of the seat emotionally draining experience that is almost as good as writer Mark Boal's and director Katheryn Bigelow's previous collaboration Zero Dark Thirty. Right from the prologue showing the history of black struggle through drawings the tone of the film is established and the film is not an easy watch. Will Poulter's character emits a vibe of evil, his character is the kind of racist who thinks his brutality towards the people who he thinks beneath him is also beneficial to them. One of the best films of the year.",9,1,3,23 December 2017
Wind River," Emotional, brutal, real and important Wind River is one of the best of the year
","After writing phenomenal scripts of Sicario and Hell or High Water Taylor Sheridan's new directorial venture is as powerful if not better. Sheridan's films follow people and lives of people that are forgotten by the whole world. Even though we are not used to this kind of life the compelling characters feels so real that the negligence of the world over these lives hit you real hard. There isn't a single actor who wasn't completely living as those characters, Sheridan's ability in taking the best out of his actors is amazing. Emotional, brutal, real and important Wind River is one of the best films of the year.",9,7,10,22 December 2017
Darkest Hour," The hour could have been darker
","This would be great as a double feature with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk where that film features the Operation Dynamo through the people directly involved, this shows the various political proceedings focusing on how Churchill is elected as Prime Minister and have to deal with all the tensions. Gary Oldman is unrecognizable as he embodies Churchill. Joe Wright's handle over period films is proved again with the production design, music and camera that perfectly sets the backdrop for such an involving story where no character is black or white. Only if the occasional romanticizing approach was handled with a bit more subtility, this could have been much greater than it is.",8,0,3,5 February 2018
The Birth of a Nation," Unbeliebvale
","The first film to truly capture the visual language of cinema to influence the masses with its dramatics created through revolutionary feats in editing, cinematography and the use of music. But at the same time blatantly racist to the extreme that even though every cue in the film is supposed to be taking one side any sensible modern person will take the other one and would hold only disgust to the makers behind the film.",5,0,3,26 April 2018
Captain Marvel," I've got nothing to prove to you
","Unlike some other movie, Captain Marvel doesn't rely on the 'hot iconic' and pseudo feminism that satisfies the patriarchal society as the sole factor for its success. Instead it has an actress who's as outspoken as the character and comprise of actual female empowerment without trying too hard.
'I've got nothing to prove to you.'This is coming from someone who's been accused of being a DC fan.",6,3,11,2 April 2019
Iron Man 2," Awesome
","May not be as good as the first one and the last 40 minutes was just lazy writing and mindless CGI action but it's so much fun and there isn't a moment that doesn't entertain. Also, Scarlet Johansson never looked better.",8,0,0,27 February 2018
Last Flag Flying," Linklater is back again
","Carrel, Cranston and Fishburne in the hands of Linklater, now that itself make this a wonderful experience. Linklater's finesse on characters and dialogues are seen here but even with the great performances from the three actors the mixed message that is unsure of it in the story is a weakness evident here. But that doesn't make it any less effective though, at times sad but always keeping the spirits up this is classic Linklater although not his best.",8,3,9,27 December 2017
Batman Returns," The best Catwoman ever
","Watching Gotham in Tim Burton's gothic visualisations is a treat in itself and when Danny Elfman's music is there to complement it, it's fantastic. The film is often over the top and the meta humour added is right in place. Walken is a charismatic villain and Devito gives life to the creepy and funny(darkly) Penguin. Even being so over the top the film was able to convey so many emotions of the characters, how three of them are abnormal people trying to cope, through different eccentricities(running around in costumes). The romantic track of Batman and Catwoman was also perfectly in sync with all of this. Above all that Michelle Pfieffer is the best Catwoman ever.",9,4,21,16 December 2017
Aquaman," Watered down?
","If not for the atrocious dialogues, totally misplaced music choices and some bad editing that ruined some really good action choreographies this could have been a lot better. The visual effects were great, Jason Momoe was charming, Amber Heard had a pretty good role and Patrick Wilson and his character was not utilised enough. The tone of the film was all over the place but it was entertaining throughout the runtime.",6,1,5,15 December 2018
Doctor Strange," Worst from MCU
","On a rewatch still the worst film from MCU. MCU didn't need another Tony Stark and more importantly, Cumberbatch didn't need another Sherlock. Whenever MCU used magic they gave enough scientific reasoning, like in Thor and while using concepts like multiverse basically like in Ant-Man but here they've just used them without any effort which is not necessarily bad but it definitely turned out bad. The overuse of visual effects, taking the great looking visuals from Inception and trying to make it more psychedelic and the stupid last 20 minutes, what's wrong with these guys. Then there is also The Ancient One who's supposed to be Asian but turned into a bald white woman? There were a few things that worked in this derivative origin story. The cloak of levitation and some of the humour did work but not as a whole.",3,1,3,15 March 2018
Barry Lyndon," Not Kubrick's best but still a great attempt
","Essentially a story of a villain, the film manages to make the viewers care about every character and hate them at the same time. The character arc of Redmond Barry is shown in a singular way that which only Kubrick could've done. The character arc of Redmond Barry is shown in a singular way that which only Kubrick could've done. With nonpareil production design and its innovative cinematography, Barry Lyndon's overlong runtime is justified to an extent.",9,2,4,7 December 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," World is a dark and comic place
",There is the tragedy all around you but there is something darkly comical about all of it and yet the way world is turning out to be who can live not being a cynic.,9,4,8,27 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not as good as those before it but not bad either
",The first two acts have a messy narrative and the romantic arc was just plain creepy and weird. Some of the actings are subpar especially Hayden Christensen. But the third act makes the film worthwhile with engaging action sequences and the plot reveals they've been shadowing throughout from the previous films. The political overtones and set up of the clone wars is enough to overlook many of its faults.,6,0,0,18 December 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Musical and nothing else
",From the lead actors getting out before production to director doing that mid production the film is full of compromises. From bad editing choices to a formulaic script full of historical inaccuracies there are a lot of negatives that can be found here. Yet this is still a very entertaining movie with Rami Malek's magnificent performance and musical sequences that are out of the world.,6,1,4,6 December 2018
Watchmen," The greatest superhero or comic-book or graphic novel based movie
","I am someone who don't have any experience in reading Superhero comics, due to that the only Superheroes I knew about were the ones I was introduced to through Cartoon network in my childhood. Because of that I've never heard about the comics Watchmen. That's why I was this late to watch this movie.-This movie is based on the comics Watchmen created in 1986-87 by Alan Moore and Dane Gibbons for DC comics . I think its right to call it a graphic novel for matured readers rather than calling it a Comics. Terry Gilliam thought it was unfilmable, Darren Arnofsky and Paul Greengrass tried to reinterpret the story into a contemporary time line but the studios didn't wanted that either and ultimately Zack Snyder was chosen to be the director.---The story begins in 1985 at the peak of cold war. By this time most of the superheroes are retired by the request of the government due to protests from a section of people. A retired superhero The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) gets killed in this situation. Even after the retirement of every other superheroes Rorchach (Jackie Earle Haley) who's still fighting crime as a vigilante tries to unravel the secrets behind the murder and also warn his old superhero buddies his theories about the murder. Everyone in the old superhero team Watchmen were living an ordinary life . Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Mathew Goode) is a successful business man who has revealed his superhero identity to the world .The most powerful living being Dr Manhattan (Billy Crudup) helps American government in many projects and stands as their biggest nuclear war power .His girl friend Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II (Maline Akerman) works along with him.Technical expert Daniel Drieberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) also lives a retired life . Going through these characters we are also introduced to Minutemen the first generation of superheroes through flashbacks. The mysterious story unravels conspiracies and turning points into a morally complex ending.---The depth given to each character gives the movie an extra darker edge to it. We get more familiar with the Comedian through flashbacks. The Comedian who was the only superhero to be in both Watchmen and Minutemen is portrayed as a very cruel and heartless person. But even though there is no scenes trying to justify him, the viewers doesn't hate him as much for the cruelties he has done . He can be seen as a nihilistic character .The name and mask of Rorschach itself shows much of his character. His mask with ever changing black and white patterns reminds the Rorschach ink blot test pictures used by psychiatrists. Rorshach is ready to go to the limits for justice.He and Comedian felt like two sides of same coin. Rorschach who will give no mercy to culprits has already left his real identity, in his mind Rorshach is the only identity he's got left .Rorschach and Comedian seemed to be two people who condemn the state of the world . When Comedian embraced the darkness for the sake of an end,Rorschach fought the darkness through darker alleys .-There is nothing impossible for Dr Manhattan who got his super powers through an accident in between an experiment . The story becomes more of an alternate history when America uses Dr Manhattan to win the Vietnam War.America's biggest weapon in the cold war is also Dr Manhattan himself. Dr Manhattan's character contain almost every power imaginable by a human being. With his power his intellect and mindset were also grown beyond human comprehension . To think that human race is nothing at all in the universe and that there would be more peace in some other planet without any humans he must have grown into a thinking capacity of Gods .Laurie who tries her best to live with a person thinking like this ultimately gets close to Daniel who liked her from the beginning---In between all this mysteries gets unraveled and chances for a nuclear war rises.Through all this we see lots of dark sides of America and how it affects the world and societies.---Just like in 300 Snyder uses comic book as the story board here .With great visual effects, we get a visual treat that stays true to neo-noir super hero movie genre . -In the starting credits sequence the history from the beginning of Minutemen is shown through photographs and news clips .Through that many historic incidents are referenced by slightly changing them for superheroes. A lot of famous photographs and paintings comes to our mind watching that credits .In the Minutemen retirement party photo Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre I (Carla Gigino) is sitting in the middle and to her side is The Comedian . This picture is very similar to the painting of The Last Supper by Da Vinci .In the painting Jesus is sitting in the middle and many believe it is Magdalena Mary sitting right next to him , if you have seen the movie and know about the Da Vinci code you can read it together .-The Comedian's badge of smiley and the blood spread on it is a recurring image in the movie and it shows the mood of the movie. Amidst all the tragedies there is also comedy a twisted sense of humour.",10,1,3,14 August 2016
Justice League," Ultimate wet dream of comic fans
","Watching Justice League on the big screen was a wet dream of comic fans all over the world for years and finally it is fulfilled. The DC Extended Universe kicked off with Snyder's Man of Steel in 2013 which garnered mixed reactions from viewers and critics. The dark tone and the reimagining of Superman's character were not accepted by many people and the chaotic action scenes added more hate towards the best Superman film I have seen. Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice followed in 2016 to mostly negative reviews resulting from the butchering of Snyder's into 151 minutes. With a lot of plot holes and a convoluted plot, the released cut of BvS had been just an average film. But the Ultimate cut released on Blu-ray with 183 minutes runtime proved to be one of the best superhero films. Then came Suicide Squad, which was another film for DC that had to go on to be a panned by the critics. With an average script and disastrous editing, the film was mostly carried by Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot who made it watchable to an extent. Wonder Woman was the film I was most disappointed in DCEU that everyone else seems to love. With nothing new to offer plotwise aside some big blunders, no real character development, no memorable action scene and a laughable attempt to make it look like a feminist film it totally disappointed me. Now Justice League is out as the 5th film in the DCEU.Justice League starts off with Batman facing the imminent threat of parademons lead by Steppenwolf from an alien world (probably from Apokolips) who are searching for three Motherboxes in the earth. To face the threat Batman and Wonder Woman tries to make an alliance with The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg.Unlike Snyder's previous entries in the series, there is no building up of scenes instead from the first scene itself action starts in this action-packed film. The plot is kept simple to provide the superhero team origin story the main focus. Zack Snyder has always excelled at making great opening credit sequences and although not as good as some of his previous works, the post-Superman world is shown with remarkable visual flair.The rewrites in the screenplay by Joss Whedon is evident in the lighter tone of the film and the joking around of the characters. Visual command of Snyder becomes more evident with scenes that were obviously part of Whedon's reshoots.The appearance of Superman in Justice League was obvious for many reasons. The scenes following his return, I was having goosebumps for a whole lot of reasons that were totally unexpected. The interactions between Superman and Flash makes you hope for a future with more of those in the DCEU.Aquaman and Flash proved to be the most entertaining characters even in the small spaces they got. Cyborg and Flash are in their beginning stages and have a long way to get to their full potential. The scenes from Atlantis provided some insight into what the Aquaman film may deal with. Aquaman was a badass character who is able to be humorous at the same time.Yet the film leaves you longing for more. The numerous cuts by the studio are not as evident as that of BvS but still makes things too quickly approached which could have had better treatment. While a lot of the one-liner jokes works a lot of them felt too forced and doesn't really fit with the DCEU. The mustache removal of Henry Cavill was clearly visible and weird to look at in many scenes.Whedon's involvement definitely changed the tone of the film which wasn't a disaster, but it would've been better otherwise. The film could've been much better if it was approached with darker themes that could've been explored here.Superman's character arc and the Injustice tease from BvS is pointing towards a darker future, though the involvement of Snyder in an uncertain state and Whedon's current involvement doesn't give hope for that arc.Even with all the problems in the film, it was entertaining and satisfying enough for someone like me with the childhood nostalgia for Justice League.",8,2,4,17 November 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Best comic-book movie of the year
","The best comic-book film of the year is not from DC or Marvel but an animated film from Sony. The animation is out of the world and trippy at times, you can see traditional animation, anime and the 3D animation and for enjoying all these styles in its distinct way I would recommend watching this in 3D. Even with a number of Spider people in here, the film is really only about 2 of them. Even with the meta postmodern comedy used in it, the emotions and finding yourself is where the heart of the film is.",8,4,12,16 December 2018
Being John Malkovich," Kaufman is a genius
","How did Charlie Kaufman manage to think up something like this? There's a lot of things going on that can be turned into half a dozen films, but it has been brilliantly woven into this crazy ride. The 3 lead actors are phenomenal and Malkovich is even greater for accepting such a role.",9,1,1,1 January 2018
The Intouchables," A fun film
",The chemistry of the lead actors and the overall fun mood keeps us entertained and the intentional avoidance of some usual formula is a plus point. But the film never really rise much above that either which I had been led to believe from all the great reviews and ratings.,7,2,3,3 February 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Best of Mcu with Iron Man
","Best film in MCU since Iron Man. Everything happened in the franchise culminated here. Both Winter Soldier arc and Iron Man's arc started from Iron Man 3 are properly implemented along with the Accords. The actual stakes to all the actions and the moral and ethical conundrums are explored, all the while making it personal and emotional for each character.",9,1,3,15 March 2018
Underground," One of the greatest political satires
","I've never seen such a film that shows the horrors of war so hard- hitting and at the same time filled with hilarious absurd comedy. In a film in which there is a triangle love story, first love of a young couple, love between best friends and brothers the greatest bond is between a man and a monkey. I can't believe I haven't heard much about this Palme d'Or winner.",10,2,4,7 November 2017
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," Untold Story
","As a biopic, the film has left out a lot of controversies in Dhoni's life but as the title suggests the film wants to tell the untold story rather than the known history of Dhoni. As a film, it was inspirational and entertaining. There were a lot of areas that could've been better but it works well enough.",6,0,0,13 November 2017
Avengers: Endgame," EPIC!!!
","A lot of things from comics I thought impossible to see in the big screen, at least in this iteration of these characters came so unexpectedly that anything I want to say about the film can become a spoiler. What can be said is that they took time to set up the emotional core of the film even though story wise it was going all over the place. But everything pays off with the visual spectacle that gives the highest level of fan service. The epic showdown in the last hour was making the crowd crazy in the theatre.",9,0,4,26 April 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Beautiful
","Although Armie Hammer may have given one of his career-best performance, that dwarfs in front of Timothee Chalamet's incredible performance. One of the best things about this film has to be that even being a coming of age story it never assumes a life-changing experience turns you into an all wise human who becomes ready for any kind of challenge ahead. Also, no one is antagonized here either. In spite of all of this, the amount of praise this got was not justified for me.",9,7,18,22 December 2017
Coco," Fun but nothing great
",Beautifully animated and entertaining but not as great as everyone is making it be. There were some beautiful songs and the voice acting was also pretty good but the concept or the execution was nothing new. As for an animated film that concerns about Day of the Dead I prefer The Book of Life. There were some obvious attempts at some political commentary that fell flat for me. The story was also quite predictable nonetheless a fun watch where they kept their respect for the culture.,6,18,57,4 January 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Best
",Probably the best Star Wars film by going to the dark places with the proper seriousness. But it's the parts where it tries to cater to the fanboys where it loses its strength and still they are not satisfied.,8,1,21,12 March 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Footloose
","The first time I thought this was an average film with too much colour and basically overstuffing that didn't have anything in it, but I also used to hate Star Wars back then. Now, this is not unexpected overstuffing in front of my eyes, so I was ready for it. But the character developments here that connected perfectly with the sequel was astonishing because when I saw the sequel I thought the continuity of characters wasn't really right but I stand corrected. Even through the actions of the characters, there are subtle moments that make their transitions in the sequel perfect.",7,1,2,9 March 2018
Uri: The Surgical Strike," One of the best military films from India
","It does have some political propaganda in it for BJP and there are some of the plot points that are cliche. But it is expertly crafted, totally immersive with brilliant performance from Vicky Kaushal and terrific action sequences. One of the best military films to come out of India even though I don't agree with its politics.",7,1,2,9 February 2019
Cold War," Beautiful but too short
","A brilliantly made film that would have been better if it had some more content to make us feel the passing of years. We see the state of the characters at each point of time but there's hardly anything that is leading to their actions. That works to a point but when it is too short letting the viewers decide on a lot of factors feels a bit lazy. But I feel like that because of how much I loved the film and this part keeps bugging me. The cinematography, performances, the themes were all mindblowing and the ending really hits you in the right way.",9,2,6,21 January 2019
The Graduate," 'Darkness My Old Friend....'
","If we look closely every major character has a story of stupid decisions and despair all the while having no idea of what's happening in their life. There is actually not even a single character in here that does anything sensible in here, yet they are completely believable since these are the kind of people you actually see around you in the world although not used as archetypes in films.
With all of its amazing cinematography, match cuts and the use of some incredible songs the storytelling itself proceeds fabulously.",9,0,1,18 December 2017
Snowden," Rivetting
",I thought this wouldn't make such an impact after Citizen four but this film was able to show many things that were quite vague in the documentary while omitting much that is in it. As a biopic the film struggles in creating the situations in Snowden's life but I believe this works the best as a double bill with the documentary. Perfectly showing the true story directly through the whistle-blower and showing the back stories that lead to this situation. America's thirst to stay as the superpower is quite something that they want the people to stand up for the gun laws instead of problems such as these.Joseph Gorden Levitt never ceases to surprise and Oliver Stone knows how to deal with controversial subjects,8,1,2,22 May 2018
The Shape of Water," Shape of water depends on what it is used to contain it
","Del Toro's visually dazzling dark fantasy is probably his best since Pan's Labrynth. The story has got elements from a number of fairy tales and so many other fairy tales are referenced throughout. The production design and the sound design along with the music is as great as the cast. Hawkins, Shannon, Stuhlbarg, Jenkins and even Jones in all the makeup have done a fantastic job. There must be a lot of symbolism I've missed because there were certain moments and images that seemed important and I could understand half of it too but couldn't decipher it completely.",9,27,50,9 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," Funny and poignant
","What a great way to start the year. Funny and poignant, I would never see The Room in the same way again. The story behind one of the worst films surprisingly turned out to be an uplifting tale of success (?). James Franco is incredible as Tommy Wiseau. Recreating the scenes fromThe Room must have been really something and that post credit scene is gold.",9,0,1,1 January 2018
The Fountain," What if you can live forever?
","The Fountain (2006) -------------------------- Death has always been an institution of fear for humans. So man always tried to find a way to escape from death or the possibility of life after death. As a social animal the death of a person would mostly affect those who are close to him. The pain of living even after the passing away of a loved one lead our mind to think that they will be watching us in their after life and they want us to be happy. - We have to understand that death is unavoidable, ultimately this is what Darren Arnofsky's The Fountain is all about. This movie amazes me every time I watch this movie . After Kubrick's Space Odyssey no other movie has given me such an experience with its visual beauty and its enigmatic nature. --- 3 stories happening in a time interval of 500 years is presented before us through a non-linear narrative. In the year 2006 neuroscientist Dr Tom Creo (Hugh Jackman) is trying to find a cure for his tumor diagnosed wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz). Izzi is writing a book called The Fountain. The book is set in the 16th century Spanish empire. The Spanish empire is loosing to the Inquisition by the Catholic church. As the last hope Queen Isabella decides to send conquistador Tomas to the New Spain in Central America where they believe the Mayans are protecting the Tree of Life. As Izzy calls Tom 'My Conquistador' playfully she hints that the book is an analogy of their life. She also says that only Tom can finish the last chapter because only he would know the ending. The third story line shows Tommy traveling in a transparent globe like Spaceship with a supposed Tree of life and a pond and a surrounding ecosystem where Tommy keeps talking to the tree and hallucinates about seeing Izzi. Even the remote meaning of what's actually happening here can only be understood at the end of the movie. - It's not clear that if all of these are actually happening or just going through Tom's mind. Even the climax leave you with more questions than answers. The genre of the movie includes a little bit of History, Science fiction, Fantasy, Spirituality etc but the soul of the movie lies ultimately in Love. The Tree of Life from Bible and Mayan belief of creation is main themes of the movie and besides them lot of other cultural influences can be seen throughout the movie. - Hugh Jackman brilliantly played his triple role (triple or single?) and Rachel Weisz mesmerized as Queen Isabella and breaks our heart as Izzi. - Gold and White are the recurring primary colors in the movie. According to the Mayan mythology Xibalba is their underworld which actually is a nebula covering a dead star . Tommy is traveling to reach this golden Xibalba. Golden color shows the meaningless physical entities and wealth and white color shows truth and mortality. --- For decreasing the use of CGI Micro Photography was used to shoot chemical reactions and micro organisms to show Xibalba and some similar sequences. This helped in increasing the timeless visual beauty for the movie. - The movie which was a flop at its release has a strong cult following since then. This movie has a special place in my mind. Its not digestible to everyone but for those can, it will be a great experience.",10,5,8,25 September 2016
The Departed," Textbook for adapting rather than lousy remaking
","Mainly the remake of Infernal Affairs but actually taking every great thing in the Infernal Affairs trilogy The Departed surpasses the greatness of the original. The only thing that shines dimmer would be Dicaprio's performance compared to Tony Leung's in my opinion, Dicaprio was amazing but Leung just edged out. The original Infernal Affairs had the strength of a powerful script and stunning performances, but when the director is Martin Scorsese every single aspect is near perfect.",9,0,1,7 November 2017
American Made," ...
",A fun thrill ride that doesn't waste a second of its time. Tom Cruise was able to rise up from the backlash of The Mummy. Even though the plot is highly glamorized from the true story at least Cruise isn't made into an invincible figure. Inspirations from Scorsese to the Narcos series is evident which kept the mood of the film consistent. If only that zero gravity scene was a bit more graphic ;).,8,1,4,11 November 2017
Mudbound," One of the best films of the year
","This is the kind of film where each character gets enough space and each of the actors gives such astonishing performance that you can't just choose who was the best among them. Carey Mulligan, Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell lead the film where Mulligan is proving her caliber once again and the latter two shows they can carry a film on their own. Showing racism through a white housewife who never has known true freedom and 2 IInd World War soldiers one black and one white who returns to their farm after the war, soaked in blood and mud have created one of the best films of the year. Jason Clarke's character essentially represents how racism can be passed through generations without being outright violent about it and how a lot of people needs to be so cautious about their every single action just to simply live peacefully. Even though depicting a bygone era it was relatable on so many levels. The best film of the year so far for me.",10,2,8,21 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," One of the best in the saga
",The worst part of the film is definitely the dialogues which always makes you cringe. There are moments that are visually stunning while John Williams fantastic soundtrack complimenting it and giving a sense of the grandeur of the tale unfolding. The engaging action sequences and the character arc of Anakin and the birth of Darth Vader itself make this a very entertaining film.,6,1,2,19 December 2017
The Lion King," Kimba The Hamlet
","I remember watching this as a kid and fairly enjoying it but was surprised to know how much praise it got when I grew up. Even on this rewatch it is pretty good and entertaining. But besides the circle of life concept everything else is quite regressive themes. Add the fact that they never gave credit to Kimba, I think my rating is much higher than it should be.",7,2,3,4 July 2019
The Big Short," Stupidity and corruption shown authentically
","At first, I thought this was one of those films in which the small-time heroes took the opportunity that not so many people noticed in the 2008 economic crisis and got rich. But it was not that simple, the guys who were pretty much, aholes at first, turned out to be the only ones those who cared for anything in the f**ked up Wallstreet. No one made money like they expected and simply by some turn of events, the whole corrupt and stupid system always tries to f**k up the common people and anyone who's not big enough. The cameos and the 4th wall breaking kept the narrative a fresh feeling and to a point was also educating. At the end, we see the rich get richer the poor get poorer and the guilty go free and this is a true story. Yet the blame is on immigrants and the poor. The stupidity of people is astonishing and the guy who predicted and invested in the economic crisis is investing on the water right now, that got to be taken seriously.",9,1,1,11 December 2017

",It's amusing to see how they first caricature and then tries to humanise the privileged stupidity of the royal family. Just shows how stupid monarchy is in the modern world and moreover even in filmmaking how the stupidity affects. Technically splendid in all the departments but the story isn't remotely communicating with the common audience unless they have a bleeding heart for Britain's peculiar monarch.,5,1,3,23 April 2018
Black Panther," More than it seems
","This is everything the hype around it promised. Extremely political without forcing it down your throat, the sole existence of Wakanda and its lifestyle is a major political statement. But the flaws of the film's politics is also to be considered, the complex situations and characters creates a rift in the moral and political correctness that are put forward by the film both of which are only met half way. Wait, is that a flaw of the film or just telling us the reality where there is no real end to any conflicts?",8,2,6,26 March 2018
Iron Man," Probably the best of MCU in a rewatch
",This is way better than I remember. Robert Downey Jr is perfect as Tony Stark and the fact that this didn't have to comply to be in the universe like the succeeding films in MCU might have a part in making it probably the best among them. The first half barely even feel like a superhero movie and the action and CGI are done marvellously. The themes they used beyond making it a simple superhero origin film and the parallels to Downey's own life makes this more interesting.,9,1,1,24 February 2018
Mother!," atmosphere of mother nature
","Arnofsky has outdone himself again in mother!. The bible allegories and mother earth concept etc gives the film a lot of depth, however, it was the film's atmosphere from the beginning to end that made it so engaging. From the first shot itself, a sense of dread was created which kept on for the whole runtime. Along with the minimal background score and the impeccable sound effects, Arnofsky's catharsis of a film is one of the greatest experience I got this year.",10,1,8,5 December 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Dawn of Justice League and nothing more
","Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice This review is for theatrical cut. Ultimate cut was awesome.The epic battle between the most Iconic superheroes ever, hopes were sky high till the critic reviews started showing up. Hopes fell from sky to the mud. Still unlike many others I believed in Zack Snyder who gave us Watchmen and Man of Steel ( For me Mos worked as a good action packed psychological drama). But from this I have to say Snyder's best comes out when he is adapting directly from an existing comics story line ( like Watchmen and 300).As of BvS Batman is experienced and brutal who blames Superman for incidents in Mos and doesn't want such a power to go unchecked. Superman continues his services to the world while having relationship with Louis along with having lots of moral conflicts. Lex Luthor is basically a psycho who is rich and brilliant but a character that didn't create any impact.As the Dawn of Justice the movie tries to include a lot of stuff for the next installments. But not exactly through easter-eggs or post credits sequences mostly they were much direct. Including the meta-human footages was so unnecessary for this movie in its own.The dream sequences of Batman were interesting but unexplained, especially the one in which he's being warned, how does that even work. Maybe it will be explained in the next installments but as of now with the totality of the movie it didn't help.Henry Cavill proved himself as the definitive Superman in MoS and now Ben Affleck shows that he is one hell of a Batman even though he was basically a Villain here.The showstealer is obviously Wonder Women. Making her a mysterious character throughout and giving a mind-blowing entry in the last battle, even if you didn't like this movie you will be definitely waiting for the next Wonder Women solo movie.The plot which basically everyone knows is made weaker by stuffing a lot in it without making it feel like having a connection with everything. Editing in the first half was so bad that even if you are not noticing it you will notice it. So even with a lot going on viewers will feel lag and the way in which the fight between the titular characters end is ridiculous.If at-least there was some more action in the first half rather than stuffing it all together into the last hour the movie could have been more entertaining.While BvS doesn't meet expectations it doesn't really give the upcoming movies in the DCEU a bad impression because one of the main problems of this movie was that it was making too much ground for the next movies without having its own.From lot of glimpses we get from here regarding next installments, they are really hopeful. It's like they showed the complete story in the trailers and gave the movie which acts as trailer for a bunch of new movies.",10,2,5,2 July 2016
The Greatest Showman," 'This is the greatest show'
",From that blast of a start to the end the film is filled with so much of celebration of everything. Breathtaking songs and choreography and amazing performances. Simple story and directly portraying social issues without making it complicated and letting every moment a reason to celebrate.,9,2,5,6 March 2018
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," A privilaged tale that is still real
",I hated it almost for the first hour for its blatant disregard about how life progress from the privileged view. But the film embraces that view by portraying the madness of these relationships of these people in chaotic layers. As much the film doesn't know about reality the earnest portrayal of this certain class of people is something that usually ends up as caricatures. Here Allen uses the same characters that are used mostly as caricatures and gave them real life and emotions that is not at all justifiable characters but still humane that it creates a certain amount of empathy for them.,6,1,1,30 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Better than I remember
","The first time I watched this I thought it was the worst in the saga but now on rewatch I find it the best after the original trilogy. This is the only Star Wars film until that point, including the original trilogy, in which I didn't cringe at a dialogue or acting at some point of the film. The set up of all the new characters and the world is so perfect while giving enough importance to the old characters just enough.",7,0,2,20 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Fun, but not a great film
","Rewatching, this time the despecialized version. The first time I was disappointed because it didn't live up to my expectations given by the hype of fanatics who follow Star Wars with religious frenzy. Now that I see for what it is, it's a fun movie that set the standards for blockbusters although not even close to being one of the greatest film ever as the fans claim it is.",7,0,0,16 December 2017
Annihilation," Very good but didn't reach its full potential
","Although not as good as Ex Machina this is a really good sci-fi and with the obvious influences from Stalker. I don't understand why the women ensemble is not a thing since a lot of films that aren't nearly politically important is celebrated on such basis. The complex characters are convincing enough for the themes of self-destruction and in a way, this works as the antithesis to 2001: A Space Odyssey but not nearly as great as it is. But in all of its great side, there is a lot that doesn't really works. This is the kind of film that could have taken a little more time to explore more of themes. The scope and ambition of the film are not completely justified with the end product, there could have been a lot more that feels untapped but exist in there. The visuals that are not CGI are great to look at but feels rather fragmented in a way that they are underutilised and the CGI looks quite outdated. But the outdated look may be due to the design they decided on which comes back to my point that the production design was confused with overused and fragmented visual ideas that really made the film a lot lesser than what it could have been. But even with all these problems the brilliant details used at each point of the film even though not fully visually realised are amazing. It feels like the brilliant script had to make some compromises in its transition and yet the Netflix involvement shows that even such compromises are not enough in Hollywood.",8,3,7,13 March 2018
Draft Day," Management
","I don't know much about American football and from what I know I don't think I like it and when the film began the atmosphere it created made me think I won't like this but I was quite wrong. The film unravels in a very engaging way and by the end, I picked up everything spread around to make sense of what exactly happens in these draftings. Personal and professional life clash and the extreme pressure of the general manager of an NFL team manager was safe with Costner and Garner never looked more beautiful or sensible. The green screen effects and split screens were unnecessarily distracting but it did help in never slowing down the pace of the film. I think this would be good for management classes but then again what do I know about that.",7,0,0,10 April 2018
