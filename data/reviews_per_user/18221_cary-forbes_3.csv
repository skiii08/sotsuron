Iron Man 3," Disappointed
","I was looking forward to seeing this movie so much, but walked away very disappointed. It's not that I thought it a bad movie, I have sure seen worse in all my years. It just left me very unsatisfied. Firstly, we have now had three Iron Man movies where a principal villain is a corrupt industrialist. Can the writers not think up anything new? I also felt their treatment of the character of The Mandarin was just woeful. The Mandarin, Iron Man's arch foe, being reduced to an almost comical character was uncalled for. They may as well have made The Red Skull a clown in Captain America. Wouldn't a big screen CGI clash between Iron Man and the true Mandarin been better, or as least as good as, the clash we ended up with in the finale of this movie? Some of these Hollywood types need to realize that we don't have to have a big song and dance to explain why a villain is a villain. A super hero movie is a fantasy adventure with lots of action, so all the villain really has to do is be bad enough for you to really root for the hero. Here's a simple plot line. The Mandarin is enslaving Chinese peasants for some nefarious plan, and the Chinese government can do nothing about it. In the hope of strengthening US/Chinese relations the Chinese government, knowing that the US has super heroes, asks the US government for help. The US send Iron Patriot, who is ambushed, defeated, and imprisoned by The Mandarin. Iron Man decides to intervene not only to rescue his friend, but to free the enslaved peasants, which he does. No corrupt politicians, no evil industrialists, just two straight up drag 'em out fights between the good guys, Iron Patriot and then Iron Man, versus The Mandarin. Simple, and something even kids understand. After all, just how many 15 year olds understand industrial espionage and the like? Just keep it simple. This movie will of course make money, it is Iron Man after all. People who have been reading about and watching super heroes for decades, like me, will always want to see them on the big screen regardless. Still, I truly don't believe that this movie deserves the box-office receipts that it will get, and judging by the reaction of the people in the cinema with us, I think a lot of other people will feel the same.",6,10,20,28 April 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Worth the Couple of Hours
","My wife and I went to see this movie over the weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed it. As a long term Star Trek fan who owns all the TV series, all the movies, dozens of books etc. I will admit that it did take me a little while to accept the alternate timeline/universe, but once I did I was able to see this movie, and 'Star Trek', in a more positive light. I really like the Kirk, Spock, and McCoy characters, and in particular like what they are doing with Kirk and Spock and the way they are building that relationship. The other characters are fine, although I will admit to not being as fond of Scotty. The story I thought was good, but still had some serious flaws. The movie didn't really seem to bog down anywhere, and was kept moving at a decent clip throughout, the action sequences and more dialogue related scenes in good balance. I love the duty uniforms too. The colours and material look good on the big screen. The few things that irked me were a) the 'ooh aah' technology factor. I find it hard to believe that in the 21st century we can't step out of a department store without an alarm going off if the security tag on our purchase has not been deactivated, but somehow in the 23rd century Scotty can sneak a shuttle into a spacedock where they are building a 'battleship' in secret with no alarms being raised, and then sneak on board the vessel itself. Go to the airport and try to get on a plane without the proper identification etc. these days. Surely they can do better in the 23rd century. b) After the nature of the initial attack on Starfleet, would the leaders of Starfleet really have met in such an unsecure location? Not likely. c) How did they get from Kronos back to Earth so quickly? d) Why did 'young' Spock really need to find information about Khan from 'old' Spock. As Khan had been frozen long before the split in the timeline, wouldn't there have been computer records explaining all about Khan and the Eugenics Wars that 'young' Spock could have referenced? As a matter of fact, shouldn't 'young' Spock have known anyway, considering his vast knowledge, especially about a conqueror as evil as Hitler? I think this may just have been a way of getting our old and beloved friend Leonard Nimoy into the movie. I'm sure that he gave his younger self good advice, but was it really unnecessary? e) It's not really feasible that the admiral in command of Starfleet could actually do what he did without being discovered. After all, could you imagine General Werner Freers (the NATO Chief of Staff) being able to do the same thing today? Again, you would think that as the centuries go by, security would be be getting better. I have a bit of a problem with this anyway. Military people swear to uphold the oath they take, and while some may deviate (and very few), it really doesn't seem possible that such a senior officer with such great responsibility would stray so much from the path. If you know any officers, you'll understand what I mean. This part of the story to me seemed to show little respect for the military and those who serve, and while Starfleet is principally about exploration, the capital starships, like the Enterprise, are run like naval vessels, and are very heavily armed. The writers should remember that. Admiral Marcus did have the best intentions to begin with. Any officer wants his personnel to be the best armed they can be, and wanting the Federation to have the best weapons is a only natural (remember what Vegetius said 'If you want peace, prepare for war'), but unfreezing a mass murderer like Khan would have been like the West resurrecting Hitler and his disciples to win the Cold War.......not a good idea. This would have been better all around if they have made the traitor in their midst a politician.......that I'm sure we can all understand. f) What is it with the messy engine room? What is shown on screen doesn't even look like it would all fit in the ship when you look at it from the exterior. It looked too much like an engine room on a warship from today, not the 23rd century. Still, with all my gripes, I enjoyed the movie, and will be looking forward to the next one. Hopefully this movie, and the third in the trilogy, will make enough at the box-office that we will get another reboot in the years to come, maybe with the timeline that we all have come to love being continued. I think it's worth remembering that if Gene Roddenberry had been alive when 'Star Trek' was released a few years ago, he would have insisted that the timeline be repaired.",8,4,8,19 May 2013
Man of Steel," A Couple of Hours Well Spent
","All I can say about this movie was that both my wife and I enjoyed it very much. After being quite disappointed in Iron Man 3, I actually sat down in the cinema prepared to be disappointed in this film too, but to my surprise, I found myself leaving the cinema with a satisfied smile on my face. Is it a great movie? No, I don't think so. Will people get what they paid for and expected? In my opinion, yes. I'm over 50 years old, and the cinema has been a big part of my life, in fact it has been a big part of my family's life. My siblings and I are all named after movie stars. My wife and I own movies dating from the 1920's to the present, so we have a very broad range and taste in movies, and have watched thousands of movies. Part of the problem with too many young people today is that they will think a movie like 'Iron Man 3' great, but they have never even seen movies like 'The Godfather', 'Citizen Kane', or 'Double Indemnity' for instance. So 'Iron Man 3' is great compared to what? You can see where I'm going with this, and why I don't think 'Man of Steel' was great. But I do think that it was very good, and if people go to this movie expecting a decent story with plenty of action they will get what they paid for. Zod and his cohorts were true villains, and the Zod character wasn't destroyed the same way that The Mandarin was made a mockery of in the Iron Man movie. The meeting of Superman and Lois Lane of course differed from the comics, which is something we should all have grown accustomed to with today's movies, but the changes made in this area fit in nicely with the plot. As a person who has a great deal of respect for those who serve, I was pleased to see the military painted in a good light for the most. Too many films these days paint the military in a bad light, thanks to movie makers who don't seem to understand that their freedoms to make the movies they want are guaranteed by the very people they are so often critical of. Of course the military, and most people in general, would be a little wary of Superman initially.......after all, who wouldn't be when confronting a being that is almost godlike to us mere humans, and who could smoke the whole planet? Add to that the fact that Zod was from Kal's home planet, and who knows, Kal may have felt enough empathy for his fellow aliens to side with them. Fortunately this doubt or mistrust didn't play out for long, and it didn't take the military or the people of earth too long to realize that Superman was indeed a hero, and not their enemy. I liked that. I also liked that even though it was against his upbringing and nature to kill, Superman realized that to save humanity he did indeed have to kill General Zod. The anguish he faced was real, and would be the same anguish that most of us would feel if we had to kill to protect our loved ones for instance. That is a reality, and I thought that the film handled that well. While I am not American myself, I was also pleased that Superman was indeed shown to be American, as his creators, two Jewish Americans, had intended. His line about coming from Kansas towards the end of the movie was classic I thought. The fact is that most of these super heroes were created by Americans, and if people don't like them being Americans, don't go to watch the movies. Anyway, for anybody looking for a couple of hours to fill in, who likes super hero movies, I'm sure that you will enjoy this film. The story and script are more than acceptable, and the action sequences were terrific.",8,4,8,10 July 2013
