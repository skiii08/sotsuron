Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," 18 years have passed and yet it's still simply magical
","I Just watched the movie again, like maybe for the 101 time, and it's still simply magical to watch it as it has been before.
I went scrolling before writing this review down over the previous reviews and I was severly shocked to see the bad reviews over it!
Ok... I understand it, you wanted to see more magic! Or it's a very childish movie for you, the film plot sticked to the book a lot, the children casting are bad actors, etc. (eyes rolling)
For starters it was meant to be a children' movie, with children actors, you can't compare these new actors to the previous great Hollywood's actors, so give them a break, and as you can see nowadays most of these child actors came to be talented actors. Second, In my opinion, it was a plus that the movie was kept faithful to the storyline of the book. And if the reviewers would have read the book before giving their bad reviews, they would have percieved that the book had a deeper meaning through it's storyline and that's in my opinion is true magic and the movie tried it best to show it. Magic is not just wand flicking and spilling here and there incantations...",9,0,1,11 February 2019
