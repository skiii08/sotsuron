Airlift," Must watch
",Awesome effort from the director to cast crew. This film definitely gives you goosebumps. This movie is definitely a treat on the occasion of Republic day. It makes you proud to be an Indian. It clearly shows that we Indians are gem & one of a kind when it comes to safeguarding the people. This movie awakens the patriot within every Indian. One man effort to risk his life & protect thousand hundreds of people. Inspiring one liners by Akshay Kumar in the movie. Entire setup in the movie look so real and connecting. Songs are good and apt. All are acted equally good. Ours is a nation where great minds like Swamy Vivekananda & Subhash Chandra Bose are born. So its shown in the movie that it is in our blood to always go on the righteous & courageous path.,10,4,6,25 January 2016
