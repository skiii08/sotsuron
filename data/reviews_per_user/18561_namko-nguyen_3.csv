Skyfall," Ultimate fallout of Bond saga
","Whether you're or ain't fans of Bond, I guarantee you for 100% that you're gonna be thrilled by this movie.It's an ultimate fallout of Bond's career and contains a huge wave of 'WOW effect'.Lots of excitement, more actions than in the 2 previous Bond movies with Daniel Craig, but one little flaw: not much of a love story with 'bond girl', maximally there are some seducing moments in my opinion, but otherwise, the director isn't screwing around with this movie and goes straight to the point.The most dangerous villain in the Bond movies so far and a perfect finale right at Bond's birthplace.Summary: perfect plot, amazing scenes and roleplays and astonishing moments",8,2,6,26 August 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Imperfect yet promising reboot of the notorious web-slinging friendly super-heroic neighbour
","As for the plot, it was better than the Raimi version.Not bad action scenes, a little bit more of classic 'spidey-lame sense of humor' and intriguing was the mysterious past surrounding Peter's parents. In Raimi's version the Spider-Man made his way to the superhero really fast, but here - we are looking at a lonely teenager with inner struggle with loneliness and he becomes the 'legendary web-slinger' a bit slowly because this is about how he learns to become THE Spider-Man - which is like at the end of the movie.A shame there is not directly the sentence: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' but there is a lot of hinting of it, the whole movie is about responsibility - trying to balance the personal and heroic life.And I am REALLY curious about the mystery surrounding Peter's parents - there are still a lot of unanswered questions. Look forward to the sequel which I hope will answer some of them",6,0,3,28 August 2013
The Wolverine," The best WOLVERINE MOVIE so far
","Well, in my opinion I found this movie better than X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE, but there were scenes where it would impress you as much as an average action movie that you'd watch just for distraction and fun. I like James Mangold as a director more than Gavin Hood in general, but I think Darren Aronofsky could've done it better.I definitely liked the whole concept of the movie: Wolverine gets so sick of his immortality that he loses his purpose and there is nothing meaningful for him in his life anymore. But when he loses his rapid healing ability, he suddenly becomes more savage and more dangerous adversary than ever and after a long time he falls in love with a woman and has something worth fighting and living for.Action scenes were very good but not perfect, it had some hilarious moments, but there weren't really very much scenes with a lot of emotions, the only affective scenes were: Jean Grey hallucinations and Logan's intimate moments with Mariko.But the ending - finally the final battle Wolverine deserves with a REAL CHALLENGE and the mid-credits scene with Sentinels, Magneto and Xavier made me really excited about X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST.",7,18,34,30 July 2013
