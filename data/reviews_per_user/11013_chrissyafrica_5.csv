Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," offensive and funny
","With a wide eyed innocence Sacha Baron Cohen plays the Kazakhstanian reporter Borat. Borat is shockingly offensive, but what is far more shocking are the feelings and beliefs of the people around him. Cohen is unflappable and though some of the stunts are clearly staged, you have to wonder how this actor actually had the fearlessness to run around places like New York city and make such a total fool of himself. From the very beginning, when Borat/Cohen attempts to 'greet' bystanders on the subway, several people threaten to physically attack him. In our theatre, the laughter was loud. Only one moment went too far for me--but be warned that moment goes so far over the line you might not recover.",7,2,5,7 November 2006
Marie Antoinette," surface beauty, but that's it
","Sofia Coppola certainly has style and an eye for sensual beauty. Kirsten Dunst is an ideal prop for Coppola's images. However, don't go looking to this film for anything deeper than a classy MTV video in corsets and hip padding. Like her supremely better Lost in Translation, Coppola employs deep silences, sparse conversation, and long close ups--unfortunately here it falls flat. Where Lost in Translation was a touching portrayal of love and loneliness, Maria Antoinette is every girl's daydream of being a princess. Jason Schwartzman seemed an odd choice, however he turns in a fantastic portrayal of Louis--quirky and a tad homely, his struggles are very sympathetic.",4,11,20,23 October 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," entertaining for a bit too long
","the first pirates owed much, if not all, its success to johnny depp's ballsy, unique choices in creating the lovable captain jack sparrow. no surprise, then, that here Jack moves to the forefront of the story. though entertaining, his efforts are not quite as successful the second time around due, unfortunately, to the obsessive media attention that surrounded depp's unusual performance the first time. that being said, this film is still quite fun, if a half hour too long. Verbinski indulges in ultra long fight scenes (perhaps to make up for the wayward plot line). There are several cute and witty moments within the fights and tiny Keira gets her wealth of fighting. One fun moment comes as she and 2 of Sparrow's men run from and fight a whole host of beastly evil things while tossing only 2 swords between the 3 of them. the last few fights are repetitive, though, and would have been well served with a more daring editor. as far as sequels go, this film successfully brings back most of the entertaining characters from the original with surprisingly ease. Naomie Harris, Mackenzie Crook, Lee Arenberg among others add a spirited kick to the film as well. like the dead men of the original, the special effects are superb. the evil creature men are perhaps a bit too graphic for the youngest.let's hope the third doesn't finally run poor ol' jack into the ground.",8,1,2,7 July 2006
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," great writing surpasses the rest of the goof ball pack
","Don't be fooled by the poster or poor trailers, this is a wickedly funny film that surpasses Wedding Crashers by a long shot. Hopefully word of mouth will bring people into the theatre so that audiences can discover that the film is not the one punch line, purely slapstick humor that the trailers make it out to be. The film is saved from such a fate with a very well written script which brings out the humor in richly fleshed out honest characters and situations we can all relate to. Steve Carell shines, bringing an added depth to his typical 'straight man' comedy and showing that he can certainly hold his own in a leading role. The supporting cast excels with just the right touch of absurdity and truth, even without the big named stars found in every other comedy these days. The film actually feels all the fresher for not having the requisite cameos.",9,1,5,22 August 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Are you a tragedy or a comedy?
","Stranger Than Fiction is a grown up story. It is a story of an everyman. We aren't given his childhood despair, we don't know how he became who he is, only the nugget that he doesn't like cookies. He could be any of us, who grew up and lost ourselves along the way. Will Ferrel is quiet, restrained, and deeply touching as Harold Crick. The movie of Crick's life made the theatre laugh, especially for those of us that got the literary jokes, but it reflects a lonely life too many of us know. Beyond the superb acting of Ferrel, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson, Ms Latifa and Maggie Gyllenhaal are appreciable side notes. This isn't a Charlie Kaufman film and it doesn't try to be. The fact that Crick is somehow the character of Emma Thompson's new novel is simply a structural element that allows us to see more deeply into his life. It begs us to ask who writes our stories and is our life worth the pages.",10,1,3,10 November 2006
