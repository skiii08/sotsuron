The Blair Witch Project," B movie at best
",This show is a nightmare the hand held cameras will give you motion sickness.The story is weak never shows any action other than the actors running around in the woods.But the director wants you to believe there is something following the cast the only clue is something or someone is leaving some kind of twigs tied together hanging in trees there are a couple of laughs. I`ve seen better horror films in a B movie.Allan Zebert,Null,0,0,9 August 1999
