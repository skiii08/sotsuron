Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fortunately, Lucas has two more Chances at a decent prequel
","Plotholes the size of antartica, dialogues not exceeding the height of your average sidewalk, and non human characters more horrific than Alien.It will disappoint; the effects are not enough to make you think why Lucas couldn't come up with something decent after 20 years of deliberation.Does this prequel contribute any information to the series we need for part II? Better still, lets do a requel first!!3/10.",3,0,1,14 June 1999
