Miracle," Great movie, 10/10, Kurt Russell deserves an oscar
","Miracle will capture the hearts of all who view it. It's much more than a sports movie. Miracle tells the true story of Herb Brooks (Russell), the player-turned-coach who led the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team to victory over the seemingly invincible Russian squad.Kurt Russell will surely receive an Oscar nomination. He is an underrated actor who turned in the performance of a lifetime in Miracle.
If you want to see acting at its best then see Russell's performance in Miracle. It's on par with the best Tom Hanks and Jack Nicholson has ever offered.The action sequences are amongst the best ever filmed in a sports movie so for hockey fans you will have to wait until the 2nd half for your thrills.
I am not a devoted hockey fan but I found this movie so entertaining I plan to see it again.",9,1,1,27 February 2004
