The King's Speech," Pure perfection; a film without villains. It's a masterpiece. Go see it.
","**** out of ****There are few stories without an enemy; and few films without a flaw. Yes, history has proved me somewhat wrong and there are indeed MANY great, flawless films, but seldom do they come along each weekend. So when they do come along, there is reason to celebrate. 'The King's Speech' is an absolutely fantastic portrait of the Duke of York, who was King George V's son. If there is a villain in this very story, it is the flaws of the Duke/Albert. He is to become his father's successor, while at the same time he worries if he will ever be able to make the grand speech(s) that everyone expects of him. This is a film about the road leading to eventual success, and it's a damn fine piece of filmmaking indeed. 'The King's Speech' is so fine in fact, that it is one of the best films of 2010; a certain Oscar contender in the long run. Here we have a film that takes few risks and only wishes to be average and seldom seen, but due to its seductive greatness and irresistible mix of humor and wit, it is more than it wants to be. This is a wonderful film in spite of its predictability, and it made me realize that a film like this comes out nigh every year. I of course mean 'a film like this' as in a film which tells a true story, and should therefore be predictable, but goes on to be a compelling work of art. This is exactly the case with 'The King's Speech', which takes a relatively fascinating premise and turns it into an even more fascinating film. One can of course tell a good story, but can one also make a good film out of it? In this case, most certainly. And can one also bring a talented cast into the mix? Oh yes, indeed. 'The King's Speech' does something that very few-and I mean very few-2010 films have done; it creates originality out of unoriginality. I won't say it's as predictable as some have made it out to be, but I won't call it original either. And for once, here's a film that does not need to be original to be the wondrous work that it is. This is a film for anyone; lovers of history, cinephiles, and 'normal' movie-goers alike. It's a film with such a wide appeal that I suppose I have not even seen the peak of its on-going success, which started with high critical praise and will end with its multiple mentioning's at the Academy Awards. Here's to hoping that it wins something. I for one am all for Colin Firth winning Best Actor for his riveting and powerful performance in this film; which might just be the best thing he has starred in yet. So whether you're in-tune with the world of film or not, 'The King's Speech' is an absolute must-see; a compelling piece of historical story-telling that uses just about all it's got to succeed. I like it when films do that; I like it a lot. Hence why 'The King's Speech' was, in my eye, a wonderful film. I say take the ticket, as long as you have the time.",9,0,1,2 March 2011
The Social Network," Possibly the best of 2010; 'The Social Network' is a directorial knock-out as well as a spectacularly written masterpiece. I loved it.
","**** out of ****I knew that David Fincher was a talented director, but this is unexpected. 'The Social Network' is David Fincher's finest film; a movie that it both bright and surprising. Who would have known that out of all the people to do it, David Fincher would be the only one to make 'the Facebook movie', as some are calling this film. And thanks to flawless direction from Mr. Fincher, 'The Social Network' is even more interesting than its premise makes it out to be. This is a beautiful, flawlessly crafted film, and it is one of the best, if not the best, film of the year. Now, I know what you're probably wondering, and let me put it out there that I understand all-too-much where you're coming from. You're probably wondering how the hell a movie about the founding of Facebook can be perfect and critically acclaimed. Luckily, I've got an answer for this one, and it can be said in but one word. That word is effort; a little thing that very few directors would have put into a movie like this. What could have easily been another great premise down the drain turns out to be one of the best great-premise-executions in recent memory. I mean, this is the best you can get with a Facebook movie. A flawlessly crafted film simply cannot be beat. And to make things even better, I feel smarter upon watching the movie. I thought not only about what was going on in the film, but also about what these fine intellectual characters were talking about. In that sense, 'The Social Network' a very, very interesting movie. Hell, it might as well be the most interesting movie I've seen since 'Donnie Darko' and 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. That's how good it is. It's not only thought provoking, but it's more complicated than it seems. It's easy to follow given how flawless it is, although there are complications underneath the straight-forward yet brilliant story that this film tells. Long story short: I loved this movie. It felt good to be watching a film so intelligent; so unique in its telling. It's so good that half of the story seems to come from the production of the thing, and what a story it must be. The filmmakers did something that's relatively hard to do: Have fun without having fun. Perhaps it's not too easy to tell, but the filmmakers worked well with the actors. I don't imagine that it was but a simple 'Hello, we're going to film this movie' and 'Goodbye, I forgot about you 6.8 hours ago'. I think that both Fincher and lead star Jesse Eisenberg will cherish this as their finest film respectively. This is, without a doubt, the best film I have seen in cinemas this year. It is by all means a good contender for Best Picture, and I hope that it wins it. Because no matter how many awesome movies come out in the course of one year, there's always got to be a film that one could call their 'personal favorite'; the masterpiece to end all masterpieces for the particular time that it is popular. Well...this is that film. It breaks the mold; it puts the icing on the cake which is its premise. And it's a powerful, effective experience. I still haven't got over it. I never will. All I can say is that if you haven't already seen it, then see it. I found there to be no problems with this film, and it was fun to watch; in that quirky, highly intellectual sort of way. Never has watching someone be an asshole been this amusing.",9,0,1,2 March 2011
