It," IT will make you cry, laugh and pee yourself all in one movie...
","Before I go on, If I could give the movie a more precise rating, I'd give it a 7.6/10. IT was a pretty good movie. I thought it was very well crafted and payed good attention to detail in a few parts. I haven't read the book but others who I know that have read it say it is pretty faithful to the source material. It seemed to be a very nice blend of the new age of horror with jump scares and horrific imagery and a more suspenseful type of horror seen in the old days. The characters, acting and locations were very well done and the cinematography was fairly good with the exception of some scenes that seemed too dark. I appreciated that they choose practical effects for some of the scenes and didn't just go full CG with all of it. Some of the CG was a bit weird but for the most part it was well done. They didn't restrict Skarsgard's acting when it came to intense scenes and it was quite refreshing. Lastly, it may just have been me, but a majority of the 'scary parts' didn't get me simply because they were either predictable or generic jump scares that I've developed somewhat of an immunity to. So, in all, I thought IT was a pretty good movie that was able to effectively mix together multiple genres and tell a good story.",8,4,10,11 September 2017
