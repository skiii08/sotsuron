The Incredible Hulk," A very good movie among its genre
","To comment on this movie I will do a comparison between the Eric Bana (EB) version and this the Edward Norton (EN) version. The first thing to say is that what the EN version has demonstrated is that with some screenplays/directors you can tell a story in 2 minutes what some screenplays/directors take half an hour to do. The EN version told us the audience in two minutes how Bruce Banner came to be the Hulk while the EB version took half an hour of valuable film time. Secondly the EN version stuck more or less to the TV series of the Hulk that featured the late Bill Bixby while the EB version went off on some weird tangent bringing in Bruce Banner's father into the equation. I was also particularly touched by the tribute to Bill Bixby that was in the EN version while also giving the great Lou Feringo (He is the TV version of The Incredible Hulk if you didn't know) a speaking part with him exchanging dialogue with his alter ego (David Banner) so to speak. To be fair the Hulk action scenes in the two versions were comparable but the idea of the super soldier in the EN version was easier for me to accept than the Father Son conflict as given to us in the EB version. I also liked the way the EN version once again paid tribute to the Bill Bixby TV series. This was done when Bruce Banner met Betty again. For those of you too young to have see the television series of the Incredible Hulk, the regular feature in that series was Bruce Banner thumbing a lift. So I have given this version of The Incredible Hulk 9 out of Ten and hope to see more!",9,3,4,2 March 2009
Glory," A classic for all the right reasons.
","The war film is probably the most difficult film to make. Many directors present soldiers as 'James Bond' like by being able to take out several enemies without receiving a scratch, while others go for the realism that leaves one depressed. Glory depicts one of the few wars that was truly about freedom. Had the south triumphed it is very possible that I would not be here writing this comment. Glory is a great film because it shows the ugliness and beauty of the human spirit. It shows the true reality of war with no sugar coated ending. I desperately hoped that somehow the 54th had triumphed only to see the smoke clear and the confederate flag being raised. That is what war is about, the good guys do not always win. I understand that Robert Gould Shaw was the only character from the 54th that was in the film. Matthew Broderick's portrayal of this character was excellent. The other characters were excellent because simply they are true to life. Morgan Freeman the wise one, Andre Braugher the educated one and Denzel Washington the ignorant one even to the point of picking fights with a fellow black soldier. I cried at the sight of the dead who had their dignity stripped in that their shoes were removed. A great film telling a true story with no frills.",10,1,2,4 January 2006
Pride & Prejudice," I assume they tried their best!
","In the music industry there are some records that should never be 'covered', that is to say sung by another artist. This is because the first or an earlier version was just too good. I am one of many who has seen the 1995 Firth & Ehle version of Pride & Prejudice and I just thought that it would be difficult for that version to be matched especially in less than half the time. Maybe I myself am, dare I say it prejudiced however I can also say that I have read the book and here is where the film lacks consistently when the 1995 version did not.The excellent language and turn of phrase brought forth by Jane Austen is missing and then some of the phrases are said out of order and some are said by the wrong character. Also for the sake of time some of the characters in the book was missing from the 1995 version(although this did not diminish the story) but for some strange reason the Knightley version added a character, to own the truth Mr Hill. WHY? All he did was put some food on the table.I assume that because of time sub plots could not be developed for example Wickhams true's nature,Lydia's flirtations and the hatred all of the Bennett family had towards Mr Darcy. Having said all of the above I believe the actors worked well with the material they had to work with and I dare say that a person who has not read the book or seen the 1995 version would have found this film quite diverting.",6,5,10,8 November 2005
Hitch," I was richly entertained!!
","I think that the basic idea of any movie is to entertain or to inform. If you want information you are looking at true life movies and historical movies. Sometimes these are one of the same. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Did Hitch entertain me? Yes it did. Okay the formula is standard. Boy meets girl or in this case boys met girls. They get together have a falling out then get back together. However the way it happened in this movie was refreshing. I particularly liked the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. The Allegra Albert romance was a delight to watch unfold, most REAL men are shy when it comes to wooing the woman of their dreams and had I had Hitch's advice I would probably have got my wife up the altar in half the time.I read the first comment on this film that appeared to suggest that this movie was played safely and good have had a few more laughs. I tend to disagree there are so many laughs you can pack into a romantic comedy without turning it into a farce. Besides relationships have there serious moments. All in all I found Hitch quite entertaining, the actors did a good job (I will be looking out for them in other movies) and Hitch is a film that I am very happy to have in my DVD collection.",8,0,0,28 December 2005
Coach Carter," Excellent!!
","My excellent wife joined a DVD rental club and had used up all the rental slots so I had to tack on Coach Carter right at the end. Eventually it arrived and it was well worth the wait. Some will say that it is a familiar story. New teacher bad kids and the new teacher turns them into good kids. However this is not fiction it actually happened. I found this film totally absorbing and while it is a long film it was even longer for me as such was the emotional impact of some of the scenes I found myself watching them again and again. It is extremely satisfying to know that there are people like Coach Carter out there and even more uplifting that in this day and age, there are kids that are willing to listen and learn. The academic achievements of kids throughout the world would be changed for the better if there were more Coach Carters out there and without sounding too sugary, the world would be a better place. A very good film for adults (to take note, we can all be coach carters in our own way) and one all parents should encourage their children to see.",10,0,0,11 July 2006
V for Vendetta," Makes you think and is VERY GOOD!!!
","Every once in a while I live on the edge! I purchase a film on DVD without seeing it first or reading a review. My purchase of V for Vendetta is one such occasion. What a purchase it proved to be, not because it was thrill a minute stuff, not because it had a totally unexpected twist, but because it made me think. Unfortunately part of what this film portrayed is very true today that is to say we are manipulated by politicians and the media. The untrained eye may miss it but it is happening all the same. I shall get off my soapbox and back to the film. V for Vendetta represents the first time I had seen Natalie Portman outside of Star Wars and I was very impressed and Hugo Weaving has one of those voices I could listen to all day long and that makes what his character says all the more potent. The plot was totally believable and the action realistic. This is not a crash bang wallop film. It is action, a love story and a vision of the future that might actually come to pass. When I find myself sitting down with two hours to kill V for vendetta will certainly be one of the DVD's I reach for first! A very good film!",9,0,3,4 December 2006
