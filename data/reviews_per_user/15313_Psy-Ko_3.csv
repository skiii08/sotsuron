Hereditary," Guess I'll be the one
","I was not impressed by this movie. I see theres only 6 other reviews and they all seem to think it's the best thing since sliced bread. Now I'm not saying it's bad, it isn't, I just didn't think it was anything special. I will give it credit for not relying on jump scares like most horror nowadays does. I saw what they were going for, that dark, high tension, more of a psychological scare, it just didn't get there for me. And then towards the end it seemed to turn into an 80s satanic panic movie which made for great comedy but not horror.The actors were fine but no standouts for me. The only one I knew was Ann Dowd who I loved from The Leftovers. Her character was a bit of a cliche and she played it that way. I think that was on purpose, if so she did it well. If not, well.... sorry Ann, I still love ya. One casting that really bugged me was the guy who played Peter, he's supposed to be in high school but the kid looks 30! In one scene he tells his mom 'we're not even old enough to drink' and I'm thinking - kid you would have no trouble buying alcohol.Am I glad I saw it? Sure, especially an advanced screening, always fun to see movies before other people. Would I bother to see it again? Nope. I think my suggestion would be to not spend the money to go to the theater. I'm sure it will be on dvd/blu/ondemand soon enough, just rent it. It's worth a rental",6,33,86,5 June 2018
21 Jump Street," Surprise!
","I really expected to hate this! I was a big fan of the original show and did not want to see this made. But today for some strange reason I found myself watching it ... and I loved it! Very different from the original series which I think was a good move! It really didn't even need to be called 21 Jump street, it could have stood on it's own but kinda glad they did so I could see all those cameos from the originals :) That was fun! I really don't have anything bad to say about this movie, it was written well, the actors were good and it was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time! I gave it a 10 star and it's rare that I do that!",10,1,3,19 May 2012
The Greatest Showman," I like a musical????
","Up to this point I think the only musicals I've liked are those with a heavy metal/hard rock soundtrack or those that I remember from when I was a kid like Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang & Willy Wonka. But this is right there with those. It made me feel like a kid again! I thought Hugh Jackman played the role great, brought a lot of life into it while still keeping him human. A lot of circus people don't like the film, one because the animals are cgi, I get that but really if you watch it , the scenes with animals could not have been done with real animals. The other reason some don't like it is because it's not historically accurate. Barnum was a teetotaler and very dedicated to his family. He also was not the greatest showman, he liked working behind the scenes and making the decisions, hiring the right people. But that wouldn't have made much of a movie would it? I understand the circus people wanting a more truthful story told but what this movie is, is fun. And it's mainstream and the way things are now anything that keeps the circus in the public eye and positive should be considered a good thing. I think as long as you aren't someone who picks apart the details of a movie you would find this enjoyable.I am counting the days until it comes out on DVD and I can add it to my collection! This is one I will watch again and again.",10,1,3,18 January 2018
