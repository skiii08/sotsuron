50 First Dates," Overall, a funny and enjoyable film
","I really enjoyed this movie.  It had a great scriptwriter, because everyone in the theater was laughing and looking upset in all the right places.  This movie was laugh out loud funny, but still not just slapstick humor. However, there was some crude humor that I could have lived without.  There was this character who was an 'it', we weren't sure if it was male or female, who was more gross than funny.  And some lines were disgusting once you thought about it.  Overall, this was a funny and enjoyable film, that I could see again and again.  I think that this movie is appropriate for anyone over 11, because of disgusting humor. It also had a great ending.  I highly reccomend this movie to people with all different kinds of tastes. 9/10",9,0,0,21 February 2004
Spider-Man 2," Spider-man 2: A sequel that at least meets the success of the first
","When everybody started leaving the theater at a screening of SPIDER-MAN 2, I believed that I had just seen a movie that, while not being the best movie, was still entertaining, had fine acting, and left me in question and wanting to see the next installment, which is scheduled to come into theaters in 2007.On the plus side, much of this movie was at least as good as the first SPIDER-MAN movie.  More angst-ridden than its prequel, Tobey McGuire does a good job characterizing Peter's internal battles.  He portrays this character with passion and believability, which leads me to believe that Tobey McGuire is a very capable actor.  Also, this movie had its funny moments.  I always enjoy unintentionally funny TV shows and movies.  Also, Kirsten Dunst portrays Mary-Jane Watson well, with her conflicting emotions and big break at the end.  Also, I liked how Peter Parker is often shown as just your average guy, which is much of the movie's appeal.
I can definitely find some cons about this movie.  For example, sometimes the action just got a little boring, which is weird, because a lot of people on the message boards are saying that the dramatic parts got boring.  Also, I don't think that Doc Och was properly cast, because there was just something about him that made him seem seem unreal, even amusing.  Speaking of amusing, there were just a few moments that were just a little too cheesy for me, like when (spoiler) everything is in slow motion and Mary-Jane  is in her wedding dress as she skips through the park while pigeons fly around her, and when Peter is walking through the college and 'Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head' is playing in the background.  Also, Aunt May really got on my nerves sometimes.  She seemed so helpless, even stupid as the movie progressed.  Overall, I believe that Spider-Man 2 doesn't surpass it predecessor, but is still a good movie.  Spider-Man 2 is appealing to just about anybody, and is appropriate for anyone 6 or over.  You will not be sorry if you go to see Spider-Man 2 in theaters, but you won't be completely awed by it either.  I give this movie 8.5 stars out of 10.  The end of this movie left me smiling, but not standing up clapping either.",9,0,0,1 July 2004
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Uh... I know this is a classic and all but...?
","This movie is supposed to be a classic, but it had no meaning, and all it had was some old guy and his friend the drunkard in it... I mean?  It had no meaning and was for pure entertainment but didn't make a lick of sense. And it's in the top 100!",Null,2,7,14 May 2003
Toy Story 2," Much better than the first
","This movie was so much better than I thought it would be.  No offense, but the first one was pretty terrible if you ask me.  I wasn't expecting much, but this movie was great!   The only thing I didn't like is that The Prospecter is way too mean.  And Jessie is a little too extreme.  And I thought that Woody was just one of those Cheepo toys you get at Toys 'R' Us? I guess it was sorta weird that like a year later, he was a collecters item... but otherwise, it was great!3 and a half out of 5",Null,0,1,7 August 2002
