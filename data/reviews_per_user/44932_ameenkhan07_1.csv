Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," pirates of the Caribbean :on stranger tides-'Amazing' backgrounds....a whole new beginning.
","out of the rest of the pirates movie , this one lacked a little bit of sudden turn of events which made the movie a little slow....Still the story was amazing creating a last moment of forthcoming thrill and interest with jack with 'his pearl' and and his own fleet of ships.The role of Barbossa was amazing with gradual display of his usual deception and pride of a 'Pirate'.Not much to go with Blackbeard.cast taken together is also good with the breath taking and beautiful Penelope Cruz to give them the boost(although she was showing in some places which strengthened the story ending)Too predictable with the thing with the switch of the chalices. Most of the parts of the movie were predictable,very predictable.But for those who haven't watched the previous pirates movie 100 times before,the new one would be an absolute delight and a treat.",10,25,45,20 May 2011
