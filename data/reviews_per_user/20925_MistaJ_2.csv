First Man," Great acting and directing, albeit a tad formulaic.
","First man is an impressive film overall- the directing and acting is top notch. Claire Foy gives one of the most emotionally complex performances I've seen in a long time, even with a type of character we've seen done before (the worried wife of the astronaut). Many of the scenes that take place on earth are filmed with the same sense of wonder that you are meant to feel during the space sequences- something I really appreciated. The wonder and importance of spending time with your family is emphasized as much as the need to explore space and complete the mission- which was really the central conflict for Neil, portrayed very tenderly and intimately by Gosling. All that considered however, the plot (and I know with it being a true story they can't alter much, and they shouldn't) unfortunately feels routine, something we've seen in other space movies before, such as Apollo 13. The lead character is training and going to space, things go wrong and the stakes are raised, a bunch of guys are hunched over computers at NASA, and there's a worried wife at home. I do appreciate the perspective Chazelle decided to take, focusing on Neil's inner struggle to honor the sacrifices people have made to get to the moon, while at the same time taking his children and wife into account and wanting to be there for them. It was just the bones of the plot surrounding the inner struggle of the characters that unfortunately made the film feels formulaic. But see it by all means and form your own options! Claire Foy's Performance alone is worth the admission price.",8,0,1,20 October 2018
Incredibles 2," Good Sequel! (Spoiler Free)
","At long last here is Incredibles 2! Being a 2000's kid who saw the first one in the theaters, I have been greatly anticipating this movie for 14 years!! I loved the first one as a kid, and my appreciation has grown for it over the years as I have grown up and gained insight to the more adult themes of the film. It is so much more than a super hero film, and I count it as my favorite Pixar movie.I try with most films to keep my expectations low, and I tried with this one but because of the first one being integral to my childhood and t being 14 years it was hard. That being said, here are my spoiler free thoughts on Incredibles 2-The movie is absolutely hilarious! Defnitley the funniest Pixar movie in a long time. It's balanced out well with the more serious and emotional elements of the story. 
The themes of parenting and sticking together as a family are played very well, in this flipped around plot where Bob is staying home with the kids and Helen goes out to have the super adventure. I thought this was a great choice, because it provided great opportunities for character work as you see how they are tested and learn from the new experiences they have. I always appreciate when films take the time to do this, especially to give further dimension to characters everyone already knows and loves. Where the movie falters is the external plot, which unfortunately does not escape certain tropes of the superhero genre. This is especially noticeable in the 3rd act, when the villain plot, while very effective and complex when introduced, ultimately becomes a tad silly and seems very detached from what the film spent the first hour and a half focusing on. This most likely will not be a huge issue for most, the conclusion to the film is very action packed and entertaining, it was just a tad disappointing to me and I felt like it was lacking cohesion. But you can decide for yourself! All in all it's a very fun sequel with fantastic character work, humor, and exhilarating action sequences. Albeit a tad disappointing for me, it is a worthy sequel to the beloved first film. Go see it and have fun!",8,13,35,14 June 2018
