Raiders of the Lost Ark," I like Indiana Jones
","Very nice, the best movie I ever seen. I like this kind of adventure film, Steven Spielberg is really a good director. The first one of Indiana Jones was great, the second one was so so, I don't no why they change the location to India, the third one was excellent, funny, and fascinate. I like the actor Harrison Ford too, he was a handsome guy, but the best movie I've seen from him was Indiana Jones, the another movies(like Air Force One) was so so. Was Indiana Jones born in Indiana or something, why do they call him Indiana Jones? By the way, let's talk about Steven Spielberg, the director. His movies are all very good, like Saving Private Ryan, Schdeler's list, Jurassic Park and E.T. There are all very good, he is a talented director, I hope he could keep directing movies.",10,0,0,31 August 2006
