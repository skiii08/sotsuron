The Ring," Fantastic scare-fest thriller!
","Best scary movie in a long time. Better than 'Sixth Sense'. Better than 'The Others'. Some people contend that the original Japanese version, 'Ringu' is better. WRONG! Ringu had its moments, but didn't instill any real fear. Samara vs. Sadako? Samara would work her over, big time....and Naomi Watts (wow!).",10,0,0,12 May 2003
