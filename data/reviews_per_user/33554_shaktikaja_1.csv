Iron Man 3," Its about the man in the suit facing his greatest enemy 'the mandarin'
","Ah! The man in the suit returns but is the story about the suit or the man? The good thing about the story is it concentrates at the man rather than the suit. The director shane black did a very good job by showing tony stark without suit most of the movie. The movie has good humor also. You can enjoy it very much in 3d as I did enjoy myself. And what does it have, the director destroyed tony starks house, some suits,and leaves tony with a suit that often misbehaves and not so much useful for a heavy battle. But instead he gave the viewers the powerful man behind the suit. And at least tony undergoes a surgery to remove the sharpnel(idea did not occur to john foreavu) and pepper survives a fall from 200ft height. But you still enjoy with a little surprise at the climax by getting(i will not reveal it. I want the viewers to guess it). So its a perfect flick to end the trilogy? Or will there be IM4?",7,2,8,1 May 2013
