Sucker Punch," Visually stunning and enthralling
",I saw this show with no expectations.. in fact I didn't even know the plot really. I have to say its the best show i have seen all year... possibly even longer. It has me so gripped that i cant stop talking about it to everyone i know. It leaves so much to interpretation that you cant help but talk about it with others that have seen it. I highly recommend this show.. the story is very deep and dark. I thought the acting was perfect. The dream sequences and slow-motion CGI was amazing. The best part is that it didn't take anything away from the story.. it wasn't just senseless violence. I am very surprised at the Gross and rating. I guess there are people that had some high expectations and even possibly didn't understand it. but please go see for yourself.,10,9,18,30 June 2011
