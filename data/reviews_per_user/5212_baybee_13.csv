Ghost," The best love story
","After 12 years Ghost would have to be the best love story in recent years. The story of unconditional love beyond the grave is so beautiful and makes me cry even after seeing this film 30 times.Patrick Swayze is Sam and Demi Moore is Molly. One night Sam is mugged and killed and is trying to contact Molly beyond the grave as the murderer is in her life. With the help of Oda Mae Brown, brilliantly played by Whoopi Goldberg he contacts Molly through Oda and of course Molly doesn't believe her. I won't spoil the outcomes for the people who haven't seen this but there are a few twists and turns although one was very obvious and was picked up the first time I saw this as a 13 year old girl. This is the only film which makes me cry every time I watch it. This movie makes you appreciate exactly what you have and who you spend your life with and not to take that person and each day for granted. This will always be a wonderful film that will be remembered in years to come.",Null,1,2,5 June 2002
The Others," Another wonderful performance by Nicole Kidman
","Being Australian I have been a huge fan of Nicole Kidman since the early 80s. Since the 90s she hasn't been able to show the world what she could do as her performances in some Aussie movies and mini series were absolutely mesmerising - Dead Calm, Bangkok Hilton, just to name a few.Last year she stepped out of the shadows with her brilliant role in Moulin Rouge and now with The Others, she's finally showcasing her talents.The Others is not a film to watch alone. I love movies like this one where you don't know what to expect or how it'll end and this certainly didn't disappoint and it definitely sends chills down your spine.The performances of her children were wonderful as well and I think Nicole should've been nominated for an Oscar for this film as well.Definitely one of the best films of 2001 and one not to be missed.",Null,0,0,2 June 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Doesn't Disappoint
","After the disappointment of the Phantom Menace I was very interested to see how this one would fare and honestly Attack of the Clones is back to what the Star Wars series is all about. In a lot of ways this is similar to the Empire Strikes Back and Hayden Christensen was brilliant as Anakin and the evil in his eyes was truly heartstopping made even more real everytime the Darth Vader score was added to those scenes in particular, I'm definitely looking forward to his transformation to Vader.From the opening sequence the charm that is Star Wars sweeps over you and you're taken on such a ride for 2 hours that you don't even realise. That is the magic of Star Wars once you start watching the screen that is it, you're completely lost in the magic of George Lucas.Natalie Portman fared a little better this time around but Ewan McGregor again, was brilliant as Obi Wan, he can do no wrong.Every adult who was a child when the first trilogy was released is reliving their childhood all over again with the preludes and after 25 years with Star Wars Episode 4 they haven't dated and a series where you never get tired of watching and it's so wonderful having us children of the first trilogy reliving our childhood all over again with the next generation.I'm definitely looking forward to Episode 3 and the next 3 years cannot come quick enough.George Lucas has outdone himself with this one and hopefully he'll outdo himself with Episode 3 as I'm sure he'll finish off with a bang since this will be the last Star Wars.",Null,0,0,2 June 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Delightful Comedy
","Bridget Jones's Diary is a wonderful film. Renee Zellweger as Bridget gives such an honest and real performance that makes you laugh and cry at the same time.Hugh Grant was very impressive and it was great to see him in such a role as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill were too much alike character wise and it was about time we saw Hugh in this light and he definitely had the funniest lines and you could tell he was really enjoying his role as Daniel Cleaver which made the film more enjoyable.I must admit I have never seen Colin's other movies and was pleasantly surprised by his performance. He gave such a dry humouress performance and that it's hard to pick the standout of the movie as the 3 of them were brilliant.Jim Broadbent gave a wonderful performance as Bridget's father and the supporting cast were equally as good.Renee's accent was so real that if you didn't know her nationality you'd honestly believe she was British, not many actresses can do this and Gwyneth Paltrow is another example of who can do the British accent impressively as well.Definitely a film to watch over and over again and one of Renee's best.",Null,0,0,2 June 2002
Good Will Hunting," Beautiful Movie
","Very rarely does a movie stand out like this one. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's story is so beautiful that you experience every type of emotion throughout the film.Robin Williams deserved the Oscar for his performance and it's sad that people often forget that when he does a serious film - he's brilliant. He doesn't showcase that other side of him often enough and he's probably the only actor besides Bruce Willis who can play every type of character imaginable. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were brilliant as well and deserved more recognition at the Oscars other than the win for the screenplay.
I am not a fan of Minnie Driver but her performance is haunting and she really put all her heart and soul into this role. If you haven't seen this movie you don't know what you are missing.",Null,0,2,3 June 2002
Coyote Ugly," Enjoyable
","Coyote Ugly is a enjoyable movie. Piper Perabo plays Violet, a small town girl who moves to New York to become a song writer but ends up working in a bar. John Goodman plays her father and even though his role is small he is wonderful like he always is in his roles as is Melanie Lynskey who plays Violet's best friend Gloria. Those two are really what makes this movie work. Aussie Adam Garcia is also terrific as Kevin as is Maria Bello as Lil.
This movie appeals to both males and females - males obviously for the coyotes and women for Adam Garcia. The sound track is brilliant as well with 4 songs performed by LeAnn Rimes and other artists and a definite must have as well.",Null,1,1,3 June 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Breathtaking
","Moulin Rouge! is absolutely breathtaking and takes you on such a wonderful journey that it's one you have to watch a few times.I've seen this about 20 times as I have it on DVD and every time Ewan McGregor sings Your Song, it pulls at my heartstrings. He's definitely a wonderful actor and you can really tell he put all his heart and soul into the role of Christian and Nicole as Satine was just as wonderful.Nicole has finally stepped out of the shadows and has shown the world what us Aussies have known since the 1980s.Everything about this film is pure magic, the first 20 minutes is such a rollercoaster ride and once you get past that is when the heart and soul of the film emerges.Jim Broadbent is a fine actor and is finally getting recognition - his past few roles in Moulin Rouge!, Bridget Jones' Diary and his Oscar winning performance this year for Iris not only shows us his versatility but also he puts everything into his role.The soundtracks are amazing as well with the recent release of volume 2 a winner as well and the soundtracks and movie are a definite must for adding to your collection.",Null,2,2,2 June 2002
Jerry Maguire," Fantastic
","Cameron Crowe is a master at storytelling, he has a way of making us really care about the characters he creates and then when casting those roles the actors who portray those characters makes us really believe and care about the character they are playing.I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, a few  of his movies have been really good like Born on the Fourth of July and A Few Good Men but ones like Top Gun and Cocktail fell short of the mark. This movie really made him stood out and his role of the arrogant sports agent who turns out to have a heart really pulls at the heart strings. He deserved all the acculations he got for this role as it was his best performance since A Few Good Men. Renee Zellweger was equally fantastic as Dorothy and the look on her face when seeing her screen son hug Jerry was magic. She was the heart and soul of the film and made you really want the best for her character and son.Cuba Gooding Jr gave a wonderful performance as Rod and absolutely deserved the Oscar. Jonathan Lipnicki was brilliant as Ray and Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's protective sister was another great performance and it was a shame her character didn't have more of a role to do with.This is a must see and one to watch over and over again.",Null,3,9,3 June 2002
For Love of the Game," Costner doing what he does best
","With the exception of Dances with Wolves, Kevin Costner shines in baseball movies. This is no exception and his best film since well, Dances with Wolves. John C Reilly gives a great performance as the best friend and catcher of the Indians and Kelly Preston finally gets a chance to show everyone her talents. She had a small but great role in Jerry Maguire and finally gets to showcase her talents as Billy's  girlfriend Jane.For love of the game is pure magic and brilliantly told, while playing his last game, Billy reflects on the past 5 years of his life with Jane through a series of flash backs and it's one of the best films of 1999 and it's only a shame the brilliant John C Reilly didn't have a bigger role to play with as he never disappoints in his movies.",Null,0,0,3 June 2002
Titanic," Amazing
","I saw this movie opening day and it took my breath away. James Cameron's fictional story of Jack and Rose entwined with real life occurances was haunting and absolutely beautiful. He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him.Kate Winslet was stunning as Rose and this movie belonged to her as you couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role.Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack and  he should have had an  an Oscar nomination for this role and the ever brilliant Billy Zane didn't disappoint in his role as Rose's fiance Cal. His portrayl of Cal was so evil that despite being an awful person, you couldn't help but feel sorry for him, especially when despite all his doings he loved Rose so much.
James Horner's music was just as haunting and he always lifts the movie he works on to the ultimate level.Kathy Bates was equally impressive in a small role and provided quite a few of the laughs of the film. Everything from the special effects, to the sets to the costumes were pure magic.This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th Century and one that will never be forgotten.",Null,363,527,3 June 2002
Scream," Great Horror Film
","When I heard Wes Craven was directing this movie, I knew this would have to be one to check out. Scream is definitely a worthy horror film and ignore Scream 2 and 3 as the first one is definitely the best.Neve Campbell gave an ok performance as Sidney but Rose McGowen's role as her doomed best friend was really great. Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard were also good although the stand out was Drew Barrymore even though she only had a small part - when she was on screen was the definite highlight of the movie.Courteney Cox Arquette was fantastic as Gale and a welcome change from her tv role. It's great to see when tv actors step out of their character to play someone different on film and she was great as the bitch tabloid reporter, in fact all her movie roles are so far removed from her tv character that she has grown into such a versatile actress and the only reason to watch 2 and 3 as she only gets funnier in each film.The only bad thing about a successful horror after a spate of bad ones is the rush of films in that genre, Scream 1 is a masterpiece in that type of genre and is a rare gem in a more miss than hit genre.This film wouldn't have worked without Wes Craven, he was involved in only A Nightmare on Elm Street 1 and he wrote the 3rd one and then with his New Nightmare in 1994 they were the standouts in that series, and the others were truly missing his genius.",Null,0,0,2 June 2002
The Sixth Sense," Wow!!!
","No words can describe the impact of The Sixth Sense, that after one viewing at the cinemas I had to go back a few times to see what I missed and how it was missed.Bruce Willis was amazing as Dr Crowe and finally showed the critics what his fans have known for years that he is brilliant in whatever he does. This was his best dramatic performance since the brilliant and underrated In Country.Haley Joel Osment, what can I say? except to say that he is only going to keep growing in his future roles and I think it's a sure thing that he's going to be successful in front of and behind the camera - like Ron Howard.Olivia Williams gave a stunning performance as Anna and brought so much emotion and pain to her role it was heartbreaking watching her on screen as that sense came out so much on screen that your heart broke everytime you saw her.Toni Collette's chemistry with Haley Joel Osment was magic and this film is a definite must see and seeing all the behind the scenes on the DVD it makes you wonder how you could have missed something when it was so obvious on screen, and seeing how it was done and portrayed you think how did I miss that?",Null,0,0,2 June 2002
The Wedding Singer," A Sandler hit
","Adam Sandler's films are either hit or miss and this one is a hit. It was so funny seeing how the 80s were portrayed and those awful hairstyles, clothes etc were portrayed and you definitely cringe when you remember how bad you used to look as well.Adam is a very funny actor and only a few of his movies, this one, Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy showcases this, his others are a little unbearing but when he strikes gold a wonderful film emerges.Drew Barrymore was amazing as Julia and it's great to see her doing so well, she's come a long way since ET and we're the same age so I've followed her career since then and is an amazing role model.Steve Buscemi gave a brilliant cameo performance as David and never lets us down with his performances.Christine Taylor was also really good and it's a shame she hasn't had a film role that showcases her talents.This is definitely one film to watch over and over again and even though you know the outcome, the ending is one to bring a tear to your eye.",Null,0,1,2 June 2002
