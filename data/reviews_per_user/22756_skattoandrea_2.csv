The Mountain II," Another movie used for propaganda purpose
","Cannot give a vote,even if as an action movie,cause unfortunately,i worked years in beautiful Turkey,for a company,very ,very close to the Turkish boss.As previously 'Fehti',about the conquest of Costantinople by the Ottomans,again,it ks so very clear this is a regime propaganda movie. Oh yes...tney are like Amerikans...and they use films for same purpose. A Tyrant propaganda. It can even be dangerous for me to say this,as,i might have to go back to Turkey for work...or possibly i will find not easy,cause i just try to admit what is so clear to all,even all Turkish people,whom i dearly love,as persons and culture,but,they now found almost impossible to react to a tirranical state...and Europe and USA(but...what can they do...???..or do they want to?)does not do anything to help the 50-60% of Turkish people to react.We did nothing against the fake golpe,we are doing nothing in front at so many normal people,especially people like us,here,commenting movies,intellectual people....no reaction,cause there; int will mean,loose it all..at least. It is totally European and United Nation fault to let a great nation,be pushed back again,and again.As United Nation did with Sri Lanka,when the Tamil went completely destroyed,raped,one by one,when the Ceylonese strike to the Tiger,but ,we as United Nation went away,lettin gruesome - kept on phone video cold blood murder,happening in that country,and i was also there,at that time,for the same job... Shame on us,shame on humanity,shame on me that i still review movies... after this. Thanks.",1,37,93,29 November 2017
