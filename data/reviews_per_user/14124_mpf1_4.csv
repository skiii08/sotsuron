Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the Lost Ark is definately one of the best movies I have ever seen...
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is definately one of the best movies I have ever seen, a real crowd pleaser. Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones, an archeologist/adventurer who sets out to save one of the worlds most famous artifacts, The Ark of the Covenant. There is enough entertainment in this movie to keep one's attention for hours. Great direction by Steven Spielberg.This film should have won oscars for best picture and director.Rating ***** out of ***** stars",10,0,0,13 January 2000
Rocky II," This is overall a pretty good follow up to the original Rocky...
","This is overall a pretty good follow up to the original Rocky. Good performances(esp. by Burgess Meredith),and the exciting bout is what makes this film a good piece of enjoyment. The training scenes are entertaining and the fight is the best match I have ever seen in a movie. The only thing that hurts this film is Stallone's so-so plot. It's okay at first, but some people could easily lose interest in the film after about the first 45 minutes or so.Rocky,after the original fight, promises that he'll retire and never fight again. Him and Adrian get married,and Rocky decides that he is going to do commercials for a living. After that fails,Adrian returns to her old job part time to make money. Rocky decides that fighting is the only way they'll get back on there feet but Adrian disagrees and tells him they'll get buy some how or other. Meanwhile,Rocky goes to work for his former trainer Mickey (Meredith)to make a few bucks and to just be around the world of Boxing because he misses it so much.Apollo Creed,aggravated with Balboa since the last fight,decides he's going to have to embarass and anger Balboa to try to get him to agree to a rematch. It finally works, and Rocky starts preparing for the fight of his life.If you like boxing, this is the movie to watch,the fight scene is so well directed and choreographed. You cannot help but cheer for Rocky when he holds up the Heavy Weight Belt and says 'Adrian,I did it!', I guarantee it.Rating ***1/2 out of ***** stars",7,0,0,21 January 2000

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The second best of the series...
","This third entry in the exciting Indiana Jones series is a slight improvement over the last installment,The Temple of Doom. What makes this one a winner is the superb teamwork of Connery and Ford. They work wonderfully together. Another thing is Spielbergs direction. You can really tell that he adores this series and that he puts everything he's got into it to make it a big,entertaining,thrill-ride.  This installment involves Indiana Jones and his clutzy father in a race to beat the Nazis to The Holy Grail. A good story,and lots of entertainment makes this the second best of the series. Spielberg made a winner out of this one,but no action movie will ever surpass the original Indiana Jones film,Raiders of the Lost Ark.Rating ****1/2 out of ***** stars",Null,0,0,21 March 2000
