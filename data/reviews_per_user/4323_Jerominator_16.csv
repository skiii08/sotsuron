Black Swan," What makes a good film?
","After watching so very many films I'd like to think I can identify a good or a bad movie. After watching this I just don't know any more. I can tell you I didn't particularly enjoy it, but I can also recognise that parts of it were filmed very nicely, the roles were well cast, the main actors put in good performances, and it dealt with some interesting ideas around paranoia, competition and control. It certainly told a story - a ballerina, who's clearly been pushed by her overbearing mother, desperate to realise her dream of getting the lead in Swan Lake. Despite a healthy amount of doubt and a poor audition, she lands the lead. Then she has to deal with the pressure of preparing for the role and embracing its uncomfortable darker side, all in the face of mounting pressure and colleagues trying to undermine her. As the enmity, anguish and paranoia build, we're left asking 'will she pull it off?'. Fair story if you ask me. So we have a nice looking film, good actors, interesting story, etc etc etc. So why the hell didn't I enjoy it? Well for starters I'm not big into ballet though I've seen a couple - maybe if I understood ballet better then I'd dig the themes it deals with. Maybe if I was female I'd understand the interplay between the 2 main dancers better. Maybe if I'd had a similar experience in my life I'd empathise with the main character's journey. If any of these were the case then surely I'd rate it more highly? This is why I asked what makes a good film. It's so very subjective that the act of reviewing and rating a film suddenly seems pretty pointless, except to yourself, as it depends entirely on who you are, what your experience is, what your view on life is, and how you're feeling when you watch it. As such, I can understand the reasons for the good and bad reviews on here. If nothing else this movie made me think about that! Stepping aside from that philosophical quagmire, in the back of my mind I suspect this is a good, but flawed film; flawed for reasons other reviewers have mentioned - clichés, shallow characters, obvious themes, no real closure on what has or hasn't happened, but hey - maybe that's exactly what the director wanted, maybe that's genius?. I'm amazed if the dancing is as bad as people have said on here - I thought it looked amazing, especially from a couple of actors. All I can say is I didn't enjoy it much - so if you're me, don't watch it.",4,0,1,22 October 2011
The Hunger Games," Dystopic Disney Gladiators
","I've not read the book so I can only say what I thought of the film.The story takes place in a future, post-apocalyptic version of the USA, where the ruling classes live in a plush central district which brutally dominates 11 satellite districts. Every year a gladiatorial games is held where 2 children from each district fight to the death until just one victor emerges. This seems to be a punitive measure for some past episode of civil disobedience.Selected from a lottery, the children are taken into the central district, groomed and sent out into a giant outdoor woodland arena to do combat while the public vicariously follows their progress via a sick reality TV spectacle akin to 'Big Brother'. A central stash of weapons and supplies is provided to fuel the bloodbath. If the contestants are lucky enough to have courted the favour of sponsors during their grooming period, they may receive additional ad hoc supplies from them throughout the contest.There's *boatloads* of potential for an interesting story given the initial setup. What I had a problem with here was the cowardly way in which this was handled - wanting to appall us with a deeply shocking idea but lacking the courage to follow through with the required delivery.Instead we're served up all the usual clichés. e.g. the central righteous character doesn't have to partake in any of the vicious butchery, trickery or deception that would normally be required for her to win such a contest. Instead serendipity seems to blissfully watch over her throughout. She's even allowed to play big sister to a little kid that under normal circumstances she'd eventually have to murder or be murdered by, but of course that problem, along with just about every other unsavoury permutation, is conveniently magicked away by the Hollywood fairies so that she remains a whiter-than-white beacon of virtue, and nothing too unpleasant happens to spoil our entertainment or derail the good versus bad morality tale.I do give them points for making her vulnerable and not some karate-kicking amazonian warrior, but her luck was just too good to be true, and events just too unbelievably convenient. This killed off any empathy or belief in the possibility of realism and transformed the whole thing into a cartoon action movie.Many of the usual sex/race stereotypes are played out. I won't expound on that as I have a 1000 word limit here but I think it's pretty obvious.One of the more unbelievable aspects was the kids from the central district who we are to believe have spent all their lives preparing for this contest. However their attitudes and demeanour didn't reflect that at all. For starters I would've thought tracking would be high on the curriculum for anyone preparing for this contest given the terrain over which it takes place. Yet they seemed to be blindly fumbling around for most of the contest, quite unable to locate our heroine who was able to hide, recuperate, wander around freely for the most part. The one time they did bump into her, instead of going for the quick, low energy, low risk kill, they hesitate for some reason and proceed to take all kinds of unnecessary risks, eventually leading to the injury and death of some in their group. Again, no signs of any kind of training. Just clumsy, clueless raging idiots.It's hard to believe that after so many annual games, this is the first time someone volunteered to replace somebody else - so no older brothers or sisters for *all* those young kiddies who were chosen then? Tough to imagine.The use of repeated scenes was poor in my opinion. I'm not averse to that mechanism in movies but here it seemed to serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever, but instead broke up the flow and left you trying to figure out what the hell that was all about while you missed what came next.I quite liked the reality-TV-meets-roman-games kind of take on the whole thing. That part was sickeningly believable and disturbing.I also liked some of the styling of the movie - the vulgar hi-tec opulence of the hegemonical central district versus the antiquated penury of its satellite districts. Nice touches on the fashion as well.Jennifer Lawrence was pretty good in the main role - she was well cast. Josh Hutcherson was OK but his character wasn't interesting - he just filled a space. Woody Harrelson's character was an oddity - a mocking amoral drunken slob laughing in the faces of the 2 kids he was supposed to be mentoring at the beginning. Then for no apparent reason he morphs into a socially conscious protective sage. Bad writing.I thought Donald Sutherland and Wes Bentley were wasted as clichéd villains but I guess someone had to play those parts.All things considered, this was well-made and well-acted with some very memorable scenes, so it could well be that my problem here is either with the source material or the screen re-write. As I've not read the book I'm simply not in a position to say, so for that reason I've given it a higher mark. If there was no book though I'd happily give it a 2 instead.Overall, this was a weak film that completely failed to capitalise on a powerful central premise, badly attempting to complement shocking spectacle with unrealistic stereotypes and offensive fantasy morality that belongs in a fairy tale story, not a story that's supposed to be about making children fight to the death for survival.",4,3,6,17 June 2013
The Impossible," Surprisingly good
","For some reason I really wanted to dislike this movie. Exploiting a natural disaster to make a story with a happy ending. I'd heard good things about it though so I watched it.Easy to be cynical or picky about something like this. If you're going to make a Hollywood movie about something so huge and sensitive that really happened, you're surely going to put a lot of noses out of joint and get a lot of flak whatever choices you make.I too was slightly perplexed when I realised the family whose experience this story was based on was Spanish. I hate it when they mess with the details in true stories, yet I've come to accept that's how movies work. Besides, if the popular account is to be believed then it turns out the real Maria had a hand in choosing Naomi Watts for the part. The rest, I would imagine, is the studio trying to increase box office sales by appealing to a wider audience.The only thing that bothered me slightly was how it focused on the tourists' plight while seemingly ignoring the plight of the indigenous population. Then I remembered I was watching a movie, not a documentary so they either make it about the one thing or the other. Lets face it if they did make a movie about the plight of the indigenous population, it would lose box office sales. Sad but true.I do honestly think there's a danger of over-sentimentalising real life tragedies on the cinema screen. Great for making people weep en masse, but somehow surely missing the bigger picture. But if it rains you get wet, and if you go to the movies, you get sentimental half-truths with orchestral scores.So all the factual hang-ups, moral implications and story choices aside, I think this was a very well acted film which makes you wonder what it would be like for you and your family to be caught in such a terrible event.Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor were good as the parents. I guess Watts got the best screen time, but I thought McGregor put in one of his better performances of late. Particularly good when he was calling home.The children were pretty good for children, especially the older boy.It made me laugh when somebody complained about seeing a breast in this movie. My god - when you consider what it must have really been like there, and the horrific sights that would've littered the landscape, you get upset about a part of the human body being exposed? Really? What kind of reality do these people live in?I don't know how they recreated some of the scenes but I thought they did an amazing job. Co-ordinating all those extras must've been hell. That was the best aspect of the movie for me - how convincing some of the settings were.It all gets highly emotive surrounding the separated family, and there are some pretty gory scenes too so watch it with a box of Kleenex and a blindfold handy.An all-round well-polished, annoyingly good(for some reason!), must-see movie. I wouldn't have thought you'd want to let kids less than 11 watch it, but barring that, good for the family - because that's what it's all about.",8,2,4,1 August 2013
500 Days of Summer," The Usual Hollywood Attempt to Remould Men/Women
","Blown away how godawful this was after all the rave reviews and high rating. Sadly it's yet another Hollywood BS manifesto desperately trying to reverse sexual roles, making guys pathetic naive afraid little lapdogs having to request permission to breathe and women sexual predators of assumed greater worldly knowledge and maturity. They shout jump and the guy asks how high. Everything coming out of Hollywood that concerns relationships now is a slave to this toxic formula. I don't know if it's enjoyable/empowering for women but I don't see how it can be anything other than offensive and ridiculous to any straight guy. It's just transparent garbage that bears no reflection on the real world, though I'm sure it's how those churning out this garbage would just love to remould the real world. Shame cos clearly JGL and ZD are competent actors given a decent script and there was some real innovative ideas played out in this, and some great music to boot, but all just massively overshadowed beyond repair by this horrific story of this poor sad sap willingly being manipulated and treated like a piece of crap by this bizarre 2D controlling witch whose only driving force seemed to be to f#ck him up in the head for kicks. And anyone who's struggled out there trying to go from their plan B career to what they think they ought to be doing must've been mortified like I was at the 2 minute happy-dappy montage where he's turning himself out to job interviews. Yeah right like that's even gonna happen if you're saddled with a broken heart. I can only assume the screenwriter here has no actual real world experience of being a man, heterosexual relationships, or the 21st century job market. My god I thought movies like this were meant to entertain you, not leave you feeling like strangling kittens. This one should come with a health warning.",1,31,48,21 December 2013
The Way Back," Survival Against all Odds Across the Mother of All Continents
","There's some dispute as to the validity of the original account that this story was *loosely* based on, so that kind of killed it slightly for me. I find it hard to invest myself in it when I know it's all been buggered about with. I will never understand the need for it. They say 'it's unfilmable', 'it wouldn't work'. I think that's rubbish though and would rather watch a true account any day than a half true account. But that's a separate issue to how good the film is so that notwithstanding .... This was a pretty decent tale of how a band of hitherto disparate prisoners escape a Siberian gulag and head south for India. What I liked about this is it avoided certain clichés like repetitive dramatic chases and narrow escapes. Very hard to find a film that doesn't follow that pattern. No instead, it accepts the likelihood that they wouldn't pursue them very far in that terrain, probably assuming that the endless cold barren wasteland would take care of them if they got away. Besides, the journey itself is enough without any added drama. So the whole film becomes about their struggle to carry on through difficult conditions. Again, you might expect them to follow the group-breaks-down-in-violent-confrontation cliché, but no they avoid this, even though one of the group has been shown to have psychotic form. The only unfortunate cliché they fell into was planting some female interest into the plot, although that was handled pretty well - no soppy romance. They even avoided the wolves versus men action fight that seemed inevitable at one point. Fair play to the cliché avoidance officer in this crew! I thought Jim Sturgess was powerful as the lead. Ed Harris awesome as always. Hell even ratboy Farrell put in a good turn. I found Saoirse whatsherface a little out of place here but perhaps that's just me - she'll probably be a huge star in a few years anyway. As they crossed freezing wastes, deserts, mountains, I did find myself struggling to believe if this journey would even be possible under those circumstances. Maybe this did happen and it would be mind-blowing if it did, but I just found it a little hard to believe. My only other criticism was I felt more time could've been spent on certain scenes, e.g. the break-out. Perhaps a victim of over-editing. Aside from these minor criticisms, I thought it was a really well-acted and entertaining watch. Not for action fans, not for kids. If you like made-up stories, and you enjoyed Defiance, The Pianist, Empire of the sun, or Castaway, maybe this is for you.",7,0,2,21 April 2013
The Aviator," A study of an extra-ordinary man tormented by an unknown condition
","I remember my older brother calling me 'Howard Hughes' when I was younger because I apparently washed my hands too much. I just wrote it off along with all the other name-calling you come to expect at that age. Hell, I didn't even know who Howard Hughes was anyway!30 years later, I watched this film and it left a sour taste in my mouth. I noticed some similarities between some problems I'd been experiencing and what I was witnessing on the screen. I tried to find out what Hughes's affliction was, but couldn't find any correlation, so I left it at that.Long story short, 6 months ago I discovered that I have OCD and have been coming to terms with it since then. The hysterical irony of it all is that a book I've been reading about treating OCD states that it is now widely believed Mr Hughes's affliction was OCD, a fact sadly absent from the previous research I'd done. So I guess everything comes full circle and I should've listened to my brother after all!Living in a world where OCD didn't exist and you were either 'normal' or 'crazy', Hughes must have experienced a very special kind of private hell. Forget Melvin Udall in 'As Good as it Gets' with his lovable quirks & snappy one liners; think more along the lines of a secret nightmare that constantly has you asking 'why me?' and redefining the meaning of humiliation and loss. The cruelest aspect is that the harder you try to fight or control it, the more potent it becomes, until you find yourself trapped in inescapable cycles of abhorrent behaviour that you hate but cannot stop, which can consume whole days at a time, which can ultimately consume your life. So if you take a determined young tycoon circa early 20th century and gift him with OCD, well you'll probably end up with Howard Hughes's life.Now I wouldn't expect any movie studio to fund a film that accurately depicted OCD. There would simply be too much strange & upsetting behaviour and it would be unwatchable for most. So I'm impressed Scorcese managed to include as much about it as he did here. Brave choice.Quite possibly Dicaprio's best role to date, and I include J. Edgar, The Departed, Revolutionary Road and Shutter Island in that. Just the range of expression and emotion, much of it unspoken and under the surface. Assuming DiCaprio doesn't have OCD, it must have been hard to mimic with a total absence of the underlying mental processes that drive it. So he did a hell of a job. Incorporated into his performance was also the noticeable transition from youth into man, as well as a traumatised post accident Hughes. It wasn't all eccentric/OCD behaviour though, he allowed some of Hughes's non-OCD charm & personality to shine through which was a realistic touch. DiCaprio not getting best actor for this is as laughable as Cruise not getting it for 'Born on the Fourth of July'. A fine supporting cast including very believable scheming vipers from Baldwin and Alda.The effects are absolutely stunning. Yes, I appreciate that the CGI is already dated but I personally don't get hung up on that stuff and I think it all still looks fantastic. The recreation of the aeroplanes and aerial sequences were exquisitely done. Likewise, the care that went into the set design and location scouting for the art deco clubs, offices, homes and washrooms gave this story the backdrop it deserved. In fact the work that went into wardrobe, makeup, furniture, and styling played a huge part in retelling this grand story properly. All this combined with the use of lavish colour breathed new life into a forgotten world, usually only viewed through a distorted monochrome or sepia lens.My only dislike here was Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. The Hepburn I remember from the movies was charming, vibrant and attractive. This Hepburn however was garish on the eye and awkwardly caricatured in speech. I suppose Kate Mulgrew(Star Trek Voyager) may have been a little too old to pull it off but she would have been an absolutely perfect choice otherwise. Now please don't get me wrong - Blanchett is clearly a very capable actress under normal circumstances and 11 out of 10 to her for effort. That's not the point though - what was required here wasn't acting, but an accurate impersonation and she was horribly miscast. This is a forgivable hiccup in a grand masterpiece though.I thought it was testament to Scorcese's respect for Hughes that he made a point of showing how Pan Am and its political shills conspired to publicly destroy Hughes in an attempt to monopolise the airline game. This last portion of the film could *so easily* have been a freakshow about Hughes's descent into isolation or speculation about how he lived out his final years - it's the obvious crowd-pleasing move. We all know that in reality his life didn't end happily but this vindication and the flight of the Hercules reminds us that he did achieve some things he set out to do and wasn't quite the vilified freak they wanted us to believe he was. Classy touch that I thought.All in all this is about as grand a picture as you'll get to see nowadays in terms of sets, resources, effects, acting, and recapturing a by gone age.Seriously - the amount of research, work and attention to detail that must've gone into this masterpiece might have impressed even Hughes himself.I have nothing but respect for Scorcese bringing this very difficult story to the screen with so much care, attention to detail and style. OK, so I guess I have a personal stake in this story but I still think it would be a disservice giving this anything less than 10 stars.",10,2,4,3 July 2013
Drive," Super Stylish and Original Crime Thriller
","The story follows a stuntman/mechanic who moonlights as a getaway driver with a very strict personal code of practice. It's not covered in the movie but there's something a little off about him - perhaps mild autism or Asperger's syndrome - and it serves to make him a dedicated and intense, if sometimes rather aloof, character. This either seems to translate as detached serenity or psychopathic drive, perhaps a double meaning on the movie's name?In what seems to be an uncharacteristic move for him, he takes an interest in his female neighbour whose husband is serving a prison sentence. While his involvement with her and her young son is initially a source of great joy for him, this unwittingly sets off a violent chain of events that unfolds throughout the rest of the film, and there on in it's really about him trying to set everything straight while protecting his neighbour and her son.I really enjoyed this unexpected gem. It is the most unique, stylish and original film I've seen in a good long time. It breathes new life into a genre that has painted itself into a corner.Within minutes I guessed it was by the same director as Bronson from the extremely stylish visuals and audio. This director seems to have a predilection for European electro-pop music, so if you particularly dislike that music, it's probably going to murder the film for you. I think it works really well on some level. Along with the striking visuals, it serves to reframe otherwise grotty or unpleasant subjects in a more sanitised and elegant, albeit completely fake, context, but one which somehow translates into an enticing alternative reality that sucks you in and makes for a hell of movie experience.Some well thought out, beautifully choreographed and acutely memorable scenes result. The originality and impact of his movies kind of reminds me of Michael Mann's early films - in particular Manhunter.I had seen Gosling in Fracture years ago and mistook him for a Hollywood pretty boy. Every film I see him in convinces me further that's not the case, but that he's an intense and talented character actor. The focus and determination in his face during the chase scenes, the innocent scenes with the lady and her kid, the brutal transformation from the start of the lift ride to the bottom. Very subtle stuff. Suffice to say Gosling was really well-cast in this part and he *became* the character - totally convincing. The female lead, Gosling's garage boss, and the gang boss are also strong in support.For my money this movie uses the full potential of cinema to transmute a potentially grim and angry story into truly beautiful art. My advice is go and see this for yourself and make your own mind up. Just one thing though - there is a lot of graphic violence so I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone under the age of 16 or anybody who opposes violence.",10,0,3,2 June 2013
The Lives of Others," Who's Watching the Watchmen
","I tend to avoid subtitles in films these days. I always end up missing something and having to rewind, and of course you end up with a somewhat broken visual experience. I made an exception for this film though as I'd read somewhere that it was worth a watch.I have to say, as a layman, I find it very tough to fault this film. I'm generally wary of hype but it's totally justified in this case. So much care has gone into the writing, stylisation, visuals, casting, acting, direction, editing, sound. I think they really wanted to tell this story right. And they succeeded.Set in East Germany in the mid 1980s, you get a fly-on-the-wall look at how the Stasi(secret police) operated, and the ubiquitous menace it sowed into people's every day lives. Moreover you get an insight into the precarious plight of the artist living under such a regime, i.e. either he sells out and produces safe art that doesn't challenge those in power, or is true to himself but risks surveillance, interrogation, an end to his career or worse.The central story is of a playwright who is in good standing with the government at the beginning of the film but falls foul of a corrupt government minister who takes a shine to his girlfriend. Ordering the Stasi to conduct full surveillance on the playwright's home, the minister then brutally pursues the girlfriend. The rest of the film follows the interplay between the watcher(a particularly expedient Stasi officer), his superior, the watchees, and the government minister.Superbly well-acted all round. Just a well-rounded piece of work. So easy to watch. It really transports you to a different place and time. You get a feel for the spartan nature of that society, the apparent havens of normality within, but of course all ultimately at the mercy of the powers that be.A beautifully crafted study of how fear and consequence influence art, the ugliness of corruption in a society where people have no power, and how divisions of good and evil aren't nearly as black and white as we would like to believe.",10,4,5,22 April 2013
Pawn Sacrifice," Better Than Expected, Great Subject Matter.
","Was hesitant to watch this - didn't like the casting of Maguire as Fischer. Ended up watching it anyway out of curiosity as this story has intrigued me for many years. I still think Maguire was the wrong choice to play Fischer. I would like to have seen Ryan Gosling or a younger Josh Lucas attempt it. At least somebody who could carry off that particular New York accent as that was one of his hallmarks for me. But that notwithstanding, if Tobey was the only choice available then I think he did a hell of a good job. I really enjoyed this. Edward Zwick knows how to put a movie together. Great supporting performances from Sarsgaard, Stuhlbarg and Schreiber. Having followed the story before I got the general impression they were trying to remain faithful to what happened at the chess championship in '72. I'm not sure how much of the mental illness stuff I buy. Clearly there was some kind of paranoia going on there - and the film deals with that well - but I think a lot is projected onto this after the fact. Secondary gains. A lot is conveniently bundled into the mental illness bucket which may just have just been the man's world view. And I think that is disrespectful to a brilliant man who is no longer here to defend himself. But that's not so much a criticism of the film as the general view of Fischer out there now. That said, I think this particular film probably handled it more respectfully than most would have done. So overall it was a lot better than expected. Definitely worth a watch - it's an extraordinary real life story about the extremes of obsession required to compete at that level, and the toll that it can, and often does, take. A subject not too often tackled in a world that worships competition for prizes.",8,18,27,31 December 2015
The Imitation Game," Why even bother
","Can nothing be told vaguely how it happened without having to force feed us with today's politically correct values? The obligatory righteous downtrodden woman physically assaulting a man, being better than all the rest yet being treated like a chimpanzee by all the evil misogynistic men, but of course ultimately being vindicated. FFS sake change the record with this stuff, it got tired a long time ago and it's stinking up so many movies. That and the historical inaccuracies and overacting rendered this laughably bad for me. What a shame - there's a great story to be told here by anyone with sufficient respect for the subject matter, who's not intent on using it as a manifesto for something else. And if there's not enough drama already in this story without all these manufactured incidents and theatricals, then the screenwriter should be banned from writing again. Another great story irreparably shat all over and a chance to educate people about history squandered.",3,20,32,27 January 2015
The Artist," Bang !
","A respectful and ambitious homage to a bygone era while simultaneously looking at how the advent of talking movies might have affected various people in the business.We join the story when our silent movie star George Valentin is at the peak of his success. A chance accident throws a young unknown girl, Peppy Miller(a play on Penelope Ann Miller perhaps?), into the mix and before we know it she's in the movie business too.The rest of the film charts how the new talking movies('talkies') thrust her into the limelight while simultaneously burying George.Up until half an hour in I was thinking 'OK very clever, but really what's the point of this silent movie approach?'. Then it started to dawn on me why they may have gone this route, and it all becomes clear by the end. Sot the silent movie style not only pays tribute to the genre in question, but also provides a clever device/metaphor for describing George's trauma in the face of sudden marginalisation by the 'talkies'.Jean Dujardin was excellent in the title role. He exuded star quality and charm throughout, while bearing a stunning resemblance to Gene Kelly. Bérénice Bejo was decent enough as his co star but somehow, and this is probably harsh, had a naive/showy aspect that didn't sit right with her character. I didn't care for John Goodman too much - he certainly looks the part but he seemed to lack the subtle range of mannerisms required to pull this off. Penelope Ann Miller and James Cromwell were good as the wife and driver respectively. I was sad Beth Grant didn't get a bigger part but only so many parts to go round here.You have to admire the research, design, wardrobe, logistics that must've been required to make this. Hard to appreciate when it's all laid out in front of you for milliseconds at a time but I'd bet a hell of a lot of work went into this.There's nothing too clever or original in terms of story - I suspect it was kept deliberately simple to provide a smooth, no-brainer build up to the denouement.I avoided seeing this film for a long time because the silent movie angle really put me off - it looked like hard work. However it turned out to be a refreshing, clever story that was more charming and uplifting than hard work.p.s. IMDb would not let me capitalise the title, displaying the warning 'Please DO NOT SHOUT in your summary' - how petty and unnecessary?!",8,0,2,10 July 2013
In Time," Nice Idea, bit of a let-down.
","I was really surprised when I just discovered this was the same director as Gattaca. I love that film and would never have guessed this was the same director. It's not that this was bad - I really like the idea - just felt the execution lacked something. It needed more imaginative cinematography, sharper style, and a better story to my mind.While I normally like Timberlake, I found him a little awkward in this part. I don't find him convincing in tough guy/action roles somehow. Some of the action scenes felt like watching kids playing at James Bond. Cillian Murphy's obviously a great actor, though his part just wasn't big enough to let him shine. The other actors were mostly OK, though didn't care for the bad guy much. I think casting was maybe this film's Achilles' heal.Also, when the film started I thought it was a real breath of fresh air that the 2 people on the run were both men, thus avoiding the tediously overdone, romance-on-the-run cliché. Of course I was wrong and they ended up totally embracing the age-old cliché. I'm so sick of certain Hollywood clichés like that. It's just lazy and cowardly IMHO. And that's not a sexuality thing by the way - purely an interest in intelligent film-making.Oh and I had a bit of a problem with the big digital clock display on everyone's forearm - seemed like a rather clumsy in-your-face solution to a delicate problem to me! Yeah I know - 'shut up, it's just a movie'.Like I say this is by *no means* a bad movie, I just felt they could have done *much* more with the idea, and I personally expected better from that director. Some of the acting brought it down too.",4,0,2,11 April 2013
The Mission," Grace and love versus politics and hatred
","This film is a re-imagining of events surrounding The Treaty of Madrid in 1750 which formalised the transfer of Paraguayan territory from Spain to Portugal. Moreover, it focuses on the fate of the indigenous tribesmen who'd previously fled to Jesuit missions located within that territory to escape Portuguese slavers.The film opens with a man dictating a letter. The man - Cardinal Altamirano, a papal emissary sent from Europe to meet with the Jesuits and slavers before deciding the fate of the disputed missions. The letter - a progress report to the Pope, recounting his visit and relaying his decision. As he begins to describe the events leading up to his visit, we are transported back in time to witness these events unfold.Jesuit priests have established missions from which they strike out into the jungle to evangelise any indigenous tribesmen they encounter, risking martyrdom in the process. Meanwhile slavers, the antithesis of the Jesuits, prey on the same tribesmen in hope of capturing them and selling them into slavery.We follow a priest and a slaver, Father Gabriel & Rodrigo Mendoza. At the outset these men are at odds with each other, but cruelest serendipity brings them together and eventually Rodrigo accompanies Gabriel to his mission to live among and serve the very people he once persecuted.With the treaty already signed and the land transferred from Spain to Portugal, the Cardinal is sent to decide whether the missions are to remain under the Vatican's protection or simply be abandoned, effectively condemning the tribesmen living on the missions into slavery.Caught in a 'Hobson's choice' predicament, the cardinal quickly realises the right thing to do, yet it conflicts sharply with the church's precarious political dependencies. Protecting the missions will endanger the Jesuit order and betray the very church he serves. So the decision is all but made and his visit is nothing more than a perfunctory gesture.This part is played well by Ray McAnally who for the most part conceals his true feelings and emotions, knowing they are unbefitting to his position.The most interesting character is Rodrigo. His journey is a tragic one. Unbearable pain transforms him from monster to man of compassion but his new-found peace is short-lived. Threatened by the very forces he once served, he has to choose whether to stay true to the Jesuit way of love and allow the tribesmen to be slaughtered, or break his vows, and murder to defend them. A very cruel predicament to be put in after what he's just been through. One of DeNiro's best, and last great performances.Then we have Father Gabriel. He embodies the love and compassion at the heart of his religion and people flock to him as a result - even Rodrigo and the otherwise hostile tribesmen are subdued. Jeremy Irons was very apt for this role, as if he believed the message behind the words.The tribal chief was played well by Asuncion Ontiveros. On the face of it he could be just another tribesmen, but he exhibits this tacit authority, hard-earned dignity and an overt distrust of the outsiders that seems to befit a tribal leader in his position.Chuck Low and Ronald Pickup have more one dimensional roles as the Protuguese slavers but they put in good performances nonetheless. Liam Neeson, Cheri Lunghi and Aiden Quinn make brief appearances, but just not enough material to merit comment.Personally, I would always rather see an accurate account of what happened rather than a crowd-pleasing or Oscar-winning fabrication. However screenwriters, directors and producers would probably argue that this is unrealistic because studios(and audiences to some degree) demand entertaining stories with heroes and villains, winners and losers, love interest, a moral or happy ending, and all within a very short period of time.So maybe we need to learn that this is just how the movie industry works and stop expecting accurate history lessons from movies.Long story short - we can take historical inaccuracies as a given in any historical film like this.The direction and camera work is just superb throughout this film.We have the signature scene of the film where a martyred priest is tied to a crucifix and sent over a waterfall. That one speaks for itself.Some of the scenes where the cardinal visits the missions are absolutely captivating - the choir singing against the backdrop of virgin rainforest is unusual and breathtaking. At the same time it's somewhat disturbing that these tribesmen have been so far contorted from their natural way of life in such a short time. But then the movie is full of contrasts like this - love/hate, freedom/captivity, right/wrong, revenge/forgiveness, humanity/politics, violence/passivity.The latter is played out beautifully in the scene where the mission is under attack and while Gabriel and his followers forsake violence in place of worship, Rodrigo and his band of men bravely attempt to thwart the imminent invasion.One particular shot stood out for me - where Rodrigo just killed his brother. I'm not entirely sure how it's done but something to do with focusing on the main character and making the background loom up around him. It worked so well, evoking the terrible realisation of what he'd just done.The film reminds me of Malick's Thin Red Line in as much as it doesn't just tell a historical story, but is also a fundamental examination of humanity, love and compassion in a brutal world. This duality works so well in these movies for me. What better purpose for a film than to make people think about this? It can be life changing to the viewer in a positive way if watched and understood with respect.If it weren't for the historical inaccuracies I'd easily give this a 10. It's a brilliantly made and acted film that can be appreciated time and time again.",9,4,6,23 July 2013
Mary and Max," Sucker Punched
","Only mild/vague spoilers here...I expected this to be a saccharine fairy tale following the usual Pixar/Disney formulas and exuding that Hollywood morality that can grind on adults. Nevertheless, I watched it anyway to see what all those good reviews were about.OK so it did start out along those lines, but with the odd dark/adult curveball thrown in.As the story unfolded though I found myself continually surprised as it touched on some very adult, tragic, and controversial themes, all the while maintaining a very tongue in cheek story book style. A hard balance, but they seemed to manage it well.Towards the end of the film, it really starts to grab you by the scruff of the neck and slap you about. That's when you realise you've been suckered into thinking you're watching a children's story when really it was a pretty heavy adult dose all along.The animation was extremely impressive. Like Wallace and Grommit on absinthe. While the lack of colour annoyed me a little, I understand why it was done that way given the ground it was covering.Word to the wise: bearing in mind it has the look and feel of a children's animated film, personally I would most definitely not let children under the age of 14 watch this. Like I say it touches on some very adult/heavy themes and you could end up with some very upset, confused kids with some difficult questions for you afterwards!All things considered, I was very pleasantly surprised with this surprisingly emotional wolf in sheep's clothing. I've got to confess that when I started watching this I was considering how bad a review I would give it, so hopefully that gives you some idea of the dramatic turnaround.",10,1,4,29 June 2013
Cloud Atlas," Mesmerising and beautiful though not sure I totally got it.
","I really enjoyed this film but hard to pin down exactly why. I certainly didn't follow all the subtle connections in play, just the more obvious ones.I think I just enjoyed the central theme and some of the sub-themes; the settings, high production values, style and execution. That said I thought the old folks home sequence seemed to jar against the rest of it somehow - maybe harsh of me and I am aware it was in the book.I love what stories like this dare to aim for though I think they seldom hit it. 'Tree of Life' and 'The Fountain' are other examples - stunning films I love, but not sure they grasp what they're reaching for entirely - you'd really have to sit with the author/director indefinitely to find out. Likewise here. Perhaps a Q&A with the authors would answer that.Ultimately of course it all comes down to what you believe in - if you disagree with the central idea they're playing with here, then you're going to think the story's a load of rubbish. I am currently very interested in that idea though so perhaps that's why I liked it all the more.I guess the idea of getting set actors to play the various incarnations of people was necessary to give some continuity(though the birthmark thing suddenly makes me realise they switch bodies when reincarnated which suddenly seems to defeat the object!?!). Sometimes it works really well and sometimes terribly badly - cue weird looking record shop guy, lawyer's wife, nurse Naokes, and a few more. Oh and that's not even getting into the whole can o'worms of western actors playing Koreans. Risky play but perhaps they felt there was no other way of holding the story together. I have to say all of that just detracts from the story for me so I think they should've found another way of doing it. Colours/names maybe - I don't know.Anyway, clearly I can't shed any light on the deeper meaning behind the film, but I can tell you that there are some moments of true visual and aural beauty in this which is what cinema is all about for me - you can keep the rest. Only other thing I'd add is I'd guess it'd be rather heavy going for anyone under the age of ~14.",7,0,0,6 April 2013
The Great Gatsby," A Brutal Re-imagining the Author Never Requested
","I'd heard some ripples about this and decided to check it out as I like DiCaprio. There was something a little off about it from the start - I've nothing against Toby McGuire as a human being and in some roles he seems a pretty decent actor, but I think he has that very distinctive kind of appearance that only really lends itself to very particular types of role - e.g. the jockey in Sea Biscuit. I don't think this was one of those roles though - he just didn't fit the character at all and some of the expressions he pulled were frankly a little embarrassing - maybe the director's fault, who knows. Simlarly I think Isla Fisher is a capable actress but she really didn't suit the part. Edgerton was better as Buchanan even though he too has an unorthodox appearance but I think he handled it well regardless. Clearly there was a bit of pro-Aussie casting going on here and it seemed a little unnecessary and misplaced given how many authentic American actors there are available.What really murdered this film to the point where I had to turn it off was Baz Lurhman's self-indulgent attempt to remould an era he never lived in, but which the author did, in a dishonest way - an uber-flamboyant way, a way in which modern liberal values are rammed down our throats, and modern music grates against the action. I know some people will admire this artistic choice but I personally don't think that's what the author had in mind when he penned it and it made me nauseous watching it. Please don't mistake this for an anti-Luhrman rant - I absolutely loved his Romeo and Juliet and Strictly Ballroom. And yes the former was also a re-imagining but one which obviously replaced the entire context of the story with another, rather than splicing in hand-picked elements; a re-imagining which I believe the original author would've actually approved of, unlike this. No, I've absolutely nothing against Luhrman, but his judgement was way off here for me.It's a shame - I was really looking forward to this, but Luhrman's choices made it a very esoteric affair that precluded me from watching it. As such I found myself stopping the movie at about the half hour mark, which is *staggeringly* rare for me to do. I wasn't going to leave a mark because I didn't finish it, but as I wrote this I realised the sole reason I didn't finish it was because it was so bad - in my humble opinion.",1,7,14,13 August 2013
