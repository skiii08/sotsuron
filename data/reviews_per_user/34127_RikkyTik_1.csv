Minority Report," Predictable & gratuitous Violence
","The premise of the film is interesting, and Samantha Morton's performance is strong. Otherwise the film surives only through manipulating the audience's emotions with constant scenes of disturbing violence.  Not to mention there are many logistic  problems. Bottom line: the story is very weak and predictable.",2,2,4,8 July 2002
