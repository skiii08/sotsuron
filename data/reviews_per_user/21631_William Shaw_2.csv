Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Let the mayhem begin!
","As a SW fan I think Ep1 was the only reason I went to a movie theater.In Turkey the movies start showing almost 3 months later than U.S.A that ' s why I usually buy The DVD of a newcoming movie. But Sw was the thing that changed it I had to go to the cinema 7 times to see it and I am waiting for the DVD. What can I say it was excellent but , it needed a liitle bit more Maul scenes...",10,0,0,27 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Maybe better than the first trilogy...
",I had a once in a lifetime opportunity...and it was to see star wars episode2 attack of the clones six days prior to its release. Ã½ live in Istanbul and they organized a special premiere for the movie. I was one of the lucky persons to squeeze his butt to a seat in the theater. George Lucas shows us that he really is a supreme director. The movie is filled with emotional and political scenes. Dont ever think that it is a love movie. The trailers do not reach to its magnificence and makes it look like a stupid romantic film. Indeed the movies has a slower pace then episode 1 but its action scenes are really breathtaking. I had to hold my breath in the coruscant chase scene. I dont want to reveal much about the plot. As a star wars fan i would want to learn everything in the theater so i respect that aspect. But i can say that all comes together. Why Jar Jar was in the series in the first place? Because it was necessary for the reason you'll see in the movie. Why the hell a crippled and dwarf Yoda is a Jedi Master? Can he ever fight? Yes but you'll have to wait a few day for more details.My biggest wish now is to live long enough to see the third installment... I feel like watching Empire for the first time and craving for some more.Tasslehoff,10,0,0,13 May 2002
