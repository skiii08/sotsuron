Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Garbage.
","This film was absolutely boring and uninspiring. Lucas has lost all the charm of the original trilogy and ruined the whole series through this lazy film. Nothing of note happens in the film and the audience are left not caring about an of the characters in the same way they did about Darth Vader, Leia, Skywalker and Han Solo. Most of the film has the appearence of a cartoon due to the overused computer generated effects which are not very realistic at all. If the next two episodes are as dull as this then Lucas should be locked up for defacing the first three films. Lucas should be more proud of Howard the Duck because it is more exciting than this nonsense.",Null,1,2,4 May 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Not Very Good
",This latest Alien film really is poor in comparison to the first two. Winona Ryder's movies (with the exception of Beetlejuice) all tend to be fairly dull and this is no different. Although there is a lot of action you find yourself not being particularly interested in who dies and who doesn't. Better than Alien 3 but still a tired formula which had nowhere inspiring to go after Aliens (1986).,Null,0,0,4 May 2001
The Hurricane," Very Impressive
",I enjoyed The Hurricane immensely. The film is very powerful and is one of those films that you think about for a while after having watched. Whether the film is a true account of what happened ias another matter but things such as Washington's performance make you believe Rubin Carter's story. The only real hitch in the film is John Hannah's accent which is somewhere between Scottish and Canadian but he never really decides which way to go. It isn't plainly obvious what will happen at the end for people who do not know the story (like myself before I watched it) but this film adds another cracker to the 'jail-conspiracy' genre. I'd give this film 8.5/10.,Null,0,2,4 May 2001
The Thin Red Line," Where is the plot?
","For anyone to say this is the best war film of all time has obviously never seen any other war films. The lack of plot in this film is incredible, nothing substantial happens in the whole film. Ok, the cinematography is good so the whole film LOOKS great but thats it. This is a huge dissapointment and shows why Terrence Mallick hasn't directed a film since or for about 20 years before! Saving Private Ryan blasts this film away in every department. Very boring film indeed.",Null,0,1,4 May 2001
