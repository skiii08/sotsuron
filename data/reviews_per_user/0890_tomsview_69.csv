Black Swan," Ends with a swan dive
","Over the years, most movies about the ballet would have ignited the kind of dreams that had young girls and their mothers lining up at ballet schools the next day. I'm not so sure 'Black Swan' would have that effect. It's a pretty dark story, which depicts the rigors of ballet at the top level, and the pitfalls of single-minded obsession.Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman), a ballerina with a leading New York ballet company, is about to get her big break as the principal dancer in a new presentation of 'Swan Lake'. However she has issues.She feels guilty about the ballerina she is replacing, and worries about a new ballerina from Los Angeles who could replace her. She feels stifled living with her mother, and is repressed socially. She also doesn't seem sure about her gender preferences as far as sex is concerned. All this is going on as she struggles to assume the dual roles of the good White Swan and the evil Black Swan in the ballet. She begins to experience strange phenomena and has difficultly distinguishing reality from fantasy. Then there is the self-harm, which is wince-inducing as she attacks herself.Eventually, everything comes to a head on the opening night of the ballet.Ten years before 'Black Swan', the director, Darren Aronovsky, made the mother of all horror movies, 'Requiem for a Dream'. It didn't have a supernatural aspect nor did it blur real events with imagined ones – it was a raw slice of life about drug addiction, which made it doubly terrifying. Although 'Black Swan' has a sumptuous ballet backdrop, it is more of what we think of as a horror movie, and has plenty of visual tricks.As the story unfolds we realise that nearly all the strange events we see are actually in Nina's mind although her hallucinations are presented realistically on the screen. But we need to believe the reality of the scenes when she snaps out of it.With that in mind, I can't help feeling that Aronovsky breaks a rule at the end; he cheats on the internal logic of the story with an ending I just can't believe, intense as it is. The injury Nina seems to have received in her dressing room would have most of us on a hospital gurney, crashing through the doors of the nearest emergency room with paramedics pumping our chests – not completing two strenuous dances before pirouetting to the top of the set for a standing ovation from the audience; the real just isn't real. For me it's a lapse in a movie that kept the tension ramped up to a high level throughout.Even if you agree with that, 'Black Swan' is still a powerful experience and worth seeing just for Natalie Portman's performance. Apart from breathtaking dance sequences, where her double could not have been involved, she projects alarming vulnerability, but is also the epitome of a beautiful, graceful, swan-like ballerina.",7,1,2,9 August 2014
Come and See," Invitation to Hell
","'Come and See' was on a list of the 10 most disturbing films you will ever see. It deserves to be.Not that it is full of gratuitous gore; much of the horror is just glimpsed; dolls discarded on the floor of a deserted house; a pile of bodies briefly seen at a distance. Much of the horror simply plays out on the face of Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko), the teenage boy at the centre of the story.I was stunned by the film, and there is not much to add to the many thoughtful IMDb reviews here; only a few comments on the technique of this film that makes it so compelling.Critic Tim Lott wrote in 2009 that the film 'makes Apocalypse Now look lightweight'. It's an interesting association, because other critics pointed out similarities in the structure of the two films. Both are journeys where the central character experiences events that escalate until the true horror overwhelms them. Captain Willard's journey into the 'heart of darkness' is not that different to Florya's; both see things along the way that violate their senses.A great deal of 'Come and See' has a lyrical quality, especially Florya's brief stay in the forest with Glasha (Olga Mironova) - it's troubling that the girl who is taken by the Nazis at the end looks so much like her. However, all the while, there is that ominous, shapeless hum on the soundtrack. You sense everything is not well and soon you will see things you cannot unsee. So much is told through those close up faces. But it is the face of Florya, aging before our eyes, which reaches into the soul.Although the film was made a few years before the end of the Soviet regime, one can't detect too much of a political agenda in the way the story plays out - the events it portrays are well documented and disturbingly true. Maybe the retribution handed out to the captured Nazis at the end symbolises what happened in the war - what was done going East was repaid as the war headed West.This masterful film doesn't really fit the definition of a standard war film; it is more of a cautionary tale. To paraphrase George Orwell a little, when people start to feel 'more equal than others', it opens the way for evil to happen.",10,3,3,28 October 2017
Catch Me If You Can," Caught me
","One thing is for sure, Steven Spielberg has an amazing range.He made this engaging movie in a five-year period that included 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence', 'Minority Report', 'The Terminal', 'War of the Worlds' and 'Munich'.Set in the early 60's, the movie tells the story of Frank Abignale (Leo DiCaprio) and how he impersonated an airline pilot, a secret agent, a doctor and finally a county prosecutor before he was 21-years old. Unfortunately, he also made a lot of money passing bad cheques. This brought him to the attention of Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), an FBI bank fraud agent who pursues him relentlessly across the United States and finally to France.The pursuit becomes a personal contest between them, and although a rapport develops, it is still a high stakes game. However, the film has a surprising outcome; the perfect close to a movie that is enjoyable on many levels.It's a long movie but it doesn't outstay its welcome, Spielberg gives the movie a light touch, and demonstrates a genuine sense of comic timing comparable to a John Hughes, a Frank Oz or maybe even a Preston Sturges.Although not necessarily a comedy, the film is studded with genuinely funny moments, much of it generated by Frank's sheer audacity. There are a number of scenes where Spielberg holds back the punchline, we can fill it in for ourselves such as Frank's knock knock joke or when Jennifer Garner as the high class call girl gives Frank $400 in change when he signs over his homemade pay cheque to her - we know something she doesn't.Between them, DiCaprio, Hanks and Spielberg make every bit of business work without losing sight of the story, which promises inevitable tragedy for Frank.There is a serious side to the story. It tells how Frank is at first dislocated by his parent's financial troubles and then shattered by their breakup. He is also affected by the behaviour of his father, Frank Abagnale, Snr, (Christopher Walken) who seems to believe that image is more important than reality. These forces conspire to push Frank into pretending he is something he isn't.The film also reflects a more naive time as far as security at airports and banks is concerned, Frank capitalises on people's innate respect for professions and institutions, but his actions hurt people, not least himself.Of course today, Frank would probably have to perpetuate his scams online, but the anonymity of the Internet doesn't require the amount of chutzpah that Frank shows as he stands at the counter in his pilot's uniform to cash his rubbery cheques, or 'concurs' with his fellow physicians when posing as the head of emergency at a hospital. It's that element of daring that makes Frank's crimes entertaining rather than despicable.I have seen this film quite a few times, and like the best movies, the reunion is always rewarding.",9,6,7,13 May 2014
Spartacus," Hail, Spartacus!
","I must admit I am always taken aback when I see how many negative reviews there are about 'Spartacus' on IMDb. But of course, I also appreciate that many generations of reviewers have been born since it was made who didn't stare up at that Super Technirama 70 screen as a 12-year old boy in 1960 to be totally overwhelmed by the experience.Nostalgia plays a huge part in the way we remember movies, but I'm obviously not alone in my love of this one. I remember one of the guys who restored 'Spartacus' for its 40th Anniversary saying that it was one of the reasons he got into movies. I can totally relate to that.There was just something more immediate, more intense, even something more modern about the movie. From Alex North's opening fanfares to Saul Bass's crumbling Roman statue behind the main titles, you knew you were in for something different.Just compare the costuming in 'Ben Hur' with 'Spartacus'. In 'Ben Hur', everything had a shiny, glitzy look that almost suggested costumes made by clever parents for a Christmas pageant while 'Spartacus' had a more muscular, functional look.Then there were the actors. Kirk Douglas as producer had mostly given British actors the parts of the Romans, and American actors the roles of gladiators and slaves to create an interesting language scheme; it worked well. Ustinov and Laughton got the most out of Dalton Trumbo's urbane and often witty script while Olivier conveyed much with just a look. You sense that although his Crassus knows he will defeat Spartacus in battle, he will never defeat his spirit.And Douglas stands up to all those esteemed British actors, gutsy really, but he wasn't outclassed at all and such intensity, I believed him; he was Spartacus.Now this was a pretty adult movie for it's time (some scenes were cut), and the audience went very quiet indeed during the heavily-shaded scene where Jean Simmons took off her clothes in Spartacus' cell. I'm surprised they even let a 12-year old in; it was such a tightly-buttoned era.There have been other attempts at 'Spartacus'. A version with Gorin Visnjic was so lacklustre I don't know why they bothered. Then there's the recent Kiwi mini series. I know some like it, and it does weave more of the real history throughout the series, however, it goes for a graphic novel approach, which I find very repetitious. Along with everyone yelling like they are dealing with strangulated hernias, I didn't see one scene in all its monochromatic, CGI weirdness that remotely approached those sunlit scenes in the 1960 version of the slave army on the march propelled along by Alex North's stunning score.As for all the political criticism levelled at the film at the time; 'Marxists in togas' etc., it just went straight over my head - it still does to be honest.I know there were battles between Douglas and Kubrick behind the scenes; two strong characters butting heads, but between them they achieved something unique even if they didn't go to each other's dinner parties ever again.No, it's the original 'Spartacus' for me. Whenever I watch it I can still feel its power.",10,0,1,7 August 2015
Lone Survivor," Seal of courage
","This is a straightforward film based on the book by Marcus Luttrell, but it lets itself down with the occasional 'Rambo' touch.The book is the true story of how a four-man reconnaissance team of US Navy SEALs was ambushed, and their epic battle before three of them, and a helicopter full of rescuers were killed. The badly wounded lone survivor, Marcus Luttrell, was saved by Afghan tribesmen honouring the ancient tradition of defending a guest no matter what.About a third of the book was devoted to the selection and training of the Navy SEALs, and although training footage is shown under the opening credits, the movie concentrates on the mission, the ambush and the aftermath.Little of the political viewpoint of the book is in the movie, which might be a good thing – claims such as Saddam Hussein supporting Al-Qaeda, don't fit with the known facts. However, the book makes some interesting points about how Western media and Rules of Engagement can jeopardise coalition soldier's lives.A jarring note in the movie is the heavy-handed way the Taliban are portrayed in the early sequence when they attack a village; it smacks a little of actors in costume. Surely it would have been better if they had been simply introduced from the POV of the SEALs as they observe the village just before the ambush.The movie is faithful to the book except for the final battle at the end, which weakens its integrity, especially when Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell starts wielding a knife.The book is a good read and the description of the battle with the Taliban, which the film follows closely, is one of the most exciting passages of its kind – maybe a bit too exciting? The book has been accused of exaggerating the number of Taliban involved and the casualties they suffered – even Luttrell's after-action report gives less than half the number given in the book.This is similar to the problems with the far more controversial 'Bravo Two Zero', the story of a British SAS patrol during the Gulf War. It appears that a great deal of colourful action was added to that account.Coincidentally, the same thing, goat herders, compromised both missions. They seem a more effective early warning system than any number of satellites.I remember thinking when the inconsistencies over 'Bravo Two Zero' came to light, why do it? The exaggeration detracted from the real bravery of soldiers trapped behind enemy lines, their endurance and courage in the face of torture – it's as though the author feared the readers wouldn't think it brave enough.The same applies to 'Lone Survivor'; the courage of the SEALs, and the heroism of the team leader who sacrificed himself to make the call for help isn't diminished no matter the numbers involved.With that said, Peter Berg's movie is competently made, and is obviously a heart-felt tribute to a small band of modern-day warriors who put themselves in harm's way for values they believed in.",7,0,0,14 August 2014
Fury," Phooey
","This film has the best recreation of WW2 tank warfare you will ever see, but to my mind, it captures roughly the same level of truth about combat in WW2 as 'The Dirty Dozen' or 'Inglorious Basterds'.I think the guys who manned those tanks in WW2 deserved a better homage than this.Much of the film revolves around veteran tank sergeant, Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt), 'blooding' replacement Pvt. Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) in the ways of war and Nazi-hating. He does this with techniques such as making the 'newbie' shoot an unarmed prisoner in the back and scaring defenceless German women as they 'liberate' their town. Before long 'Wardaddy' has Norman joyfully creating the red mist around many of the Herrenvolk before most of the crew go out in a blaze of glory.For a while now, filmmakers have revelled in showing 'how war really is' with plenty of the stuff the old Hollywood Production Code used to stop. But in 'Fury', the US Troops are so badass that it wouldn't have been a surprise to see the Germans head for the Russian lines to surrender because they thought they would stand a better chance of survival.There are some odd touches in 'Fury'. 'Wardaddy' cruises around with a far too modern haircut, and about the same level of authority as George S Patton - he also makes nearly as many speeches as 'Ol Blood 'n' Guts'. It actually comes as a surprise when we see him taking orders from an officer.With the exception of Norman, the guys in the tank crew are played in a rather dumbed-down way. However, that doesn't stop them from also making speeches - there are more before-battle speeches here than in Henry V or John Wayne's 'The Alamo'.Even when a film isn't based on a specific historical event, the expectation is that it will attempt to capture a feeling for the time it portrays. Although 'Fury' captures the look, I'm not so sure about the feeling.Was executing prisoners the norm? Credulity is stretched to breaking point in that scene where 'Wardaddy' teaches Norman how to whack Germans, especially when it was done in front of such a large audience. What, no officers around to have 'Wardaddy' arrested and sent for a court martial or most probably a Section 8? Or even any Army Intelligence guys who needed prisoners for interrogation? It would be naïve to think US and allied forces didn't kill prisoners in the heat of battle during the war in Europe, but some of the scenes in 'Fury' seem informed by the fact and fiction of all the other wars the US has fought since WW2.Without the touches of nastiness and the brilliantly-staged battle scenes, the storyline of 'Fury' is decidedly routine, not much above an episode of the old 'Combat' TV series, and in my opinion, falls way short of other portrayals of WW2 such as 'Band of Brothers' or Carl Foreman's 'The Victors'.Millions of people around the world will see 'Fury'; most won't have a keen knowledge of history; they probably won't differentiate that much between wars - a bit like the people who actually made the film - and if that is the impression they get of the US army, then the job of the modern-day soldier is made just that much harder.",5,1,5,21 February 2015
World War Z," Wake me when the war is over
","'World War Z' is a roller coaster ride – an exhilarating one as long as the ride continues. It's when the movie starts to take itself seriously that the ride comes to a halt and we are left swinging in the air.A plague breaks out that turns humans into zombies with the sole purpose of infecting other humans with the same condition. After experiencing a sudden zombie attack in Philadelphia, Gerry Lane, played by Brad Pitt, an ex-United Nations investigator, is coerced into returning to investigate the zombie pandemic.If you want something done, ask a busy man. After saving his family from the zombies, Gerry has a number of hair-raising escapes from the many afflicted areas around the world, at one point lopping off the zombie-infected hand of an Israeli girl-soldier. After blowing up a plane he is travelling on, and surviving, he has a eureka moment and comes up with the solution to the zombie plague.Although not totally new to cinema, zombie takeover has never looked as spectacular as it does in this film. However, if behaviour on our streets outside nightclubs at 2 a.m. is any guide, it appears that the zombies took over some time ago.Although the aerial shots and mass scenes of the zombies in 'World War Z' are breathtaking, the action slows when it gets to ground level in some rather ordinary looking sets. A lot of the action takes place in back alleys and derelict buildings, with much repetitious zapping of zombies seemingly inspired by video games.I must admit that my eyes started to glaze over between the first zombie attack and Gerry's arrival in Jerusalem where the action picks up again. The movie slows in the middle, and again at the end when the story gets bound up in some complicated science, and then becomes mired inside a laboratory in Wales.The Jerusalem wall scene is amazing as the zombies climb all over each other to get to the top. Of course, Israel really does have a similar wall along the West Bank, obviously to protect people on the inside from people on the outside. Is there sub-text here? Surely the filmmakers didn't try to bury a less than subtle political message in what is essentially a mindless horror/action flick.The movie also feels a bit déjà vu. It is similar to Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds'. It was aliens in that case but much of the action plays out the same, especially the way the zombies suddenly appear, and in Brad's attempts to protect his family. Mind you, I enjoy revisiting Spielberg's movie every now and then, but I can't say that I'll need another helping of 'World War Z' any time soon.Although the film delivers some amazingly spectacular scenes, when it starts to take its pseudo-science seriously, it's time to reach for the No-Doz.",4,1,2,31 October 2013
Passengers," Worth booking a pod
","Have you ever wondered what would happen if you were in cryogenic hibernation on a space ship on a 120-year trip to another planet and you woke up 90-years too early? Well this movie may have the answer.'Passengers' has two appealing stars in Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as Jim Preston and Aurora Lane (what a great name), plus pretty good special effects and an unusual story. The movie was a little lighter than I thought it would be. People have woken up on these kinds of trips before and it's usually not a good thing – remember what happened to Ripley and the crew of the Nostromo when they got an early wake-up call in 'Alien'.'Passengers' manages to remain entertaining from beginning to end without the intrusion of any kind of mutant life form.My one reservation is actually with the costuming. Not all of it, just Jim Preston's outfit. A boring old shirt and pants? We could have expected something more futuristic than items that look like they were bought off the rack in the local menswear department. Aurora fares better with her podwear; it's understated, but looks a lot more timeless. Laurence Fishburne as Chief Mancuso nails it in a collarless jacket that would have passed muster on the bridge in any episode of 'Star Trek' – amazing how epaulets look futuristic. The space ship Aurora has a nice sense of size with a huge bar that is a little reminiscent of the one in 'The Shining' where Jack Nicholson was the solitary patron in the empty hotel. I must admit I do like my sci-fi films to lean towards the cerebral. I don't mind the odd death ray or a chest burster now and then, but I love the kind of sci-fi film that plays tricks with your head: 'Interstellar', 'Contact', 'Moon' and of course the daddy of them all '2001: A Spacy Odyssey'. Although 'Passengers' has a touch of '2001' with two space travellers conversing with a master computer, it doesn't delve as deeply into the psyche as those other trips into inner and outer space. However it does raise ethical questions within the context of the story. 'Passengers' may get a little predictable towards the end, but saves a surprise for the final scene; it's a voyage worth taking.",7,0,0,12 April 2017
Alexander," Alexander gets Stoned
","Oliver Stone's strategy for bringing the great Macedonian conqueror to life in his $150 million movie was flawed from the start, and Alexander the Great, who was never beaten in battle, went down in defeat yet again on the screen.Apparently this is the movie that Oliver Stone always wanted to make. He even had Robert Rossen's stilted 1956 film, 'Alexander the Great' to show the pitfalls to avoid. However he may not have done his homework because many of the elements that let down the earlier film do the same thing to this one.The story covers Alexander's life from boyhood until his death in Persia, but his life was so intertwined with the politics of ancient Greece that Stone needed a way to help the audience understand what was happening. He decided on narration by Anthony Hopkins who plays one of Alexander's generals, however it makes the movie feel old-fashioned from the start.The relationship between Alexander and his mother, Olympus, played by Angelina Jolie, and with his father, Philip of Macedon, played by Val Kilmer, is explored ad nauseum, and it all becomes rather tedious. Finally and fatally, Colin Farrell does not project enough power or charisma to make you believe he could lead men across the road to the pub let alone on a campaign to conquer the world.Angelina Jolie went to town on her character. Weighed down with snakes and large earrings, plus an accent seemingly inspired by Natasha Fatale of 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' fame, she delivers an over-the-top performance, which also helps knock the movie off balance.After his father's death, Alexander leads the Greeks and Macedonians into Persia to complete what he believes is his destiny. Stone waits until the battle of Gaugamela in Persia before he unleashes an awesome spectacle – the film needed more of this. Instead, when screen time isn't taken up with the politics, it is taken up with Alexander's pursuit of young men. Not only does Stone present us with the concept of a brotherhood of warriors along the lines of the Gay Mardi Gras Recovery Party, but Alexander pursues just about anything in a loincloth.That's not to say the film has no female love interest because Alexander can march in any direction – his encounter with Rosario Dawson as Roxanne is a very hot scene. Not only that, but there is definitely subtext in Alexander's relationship with his mother. That's a lot of R&R for one soldier.Although the movie is long, it seems longer. Unfortunately, after Alexander's spectacular entry into Babylon, the story meanders – we are told about Alexander's conquests but we don't actually see them. Finally, as Alexander approaches the Indus River and the gateway to India, he faces his toughest battle. The Macedonians encounter an Indian army, which employs elephants like M1 Abrams tanks. The fuzziness of Stone's thinking reveals itself when he uses a red filter during the battle. An effect such as this was probably passé by the late 60's – now, it's just annoying. However, by this stage, the audience can't wait for it to end. This duly takes place after Alexander's death from disease.The life of Alexander is well documented. Stone had plenty of material to draw on. He opted to concentrate on the politics and Alexander's tortured psyche rather than the campaigns of conquest that are the real reason for his enduring fame. Although too many battles would no doubt have caused audience battle fatigue, the movie lacks action.For a while, Baz Lurman was also slated to direct a version of the mighty Macedonian's life. Although this now seems unlikely, if he ever does, maybe his quirky, full-throttle approach to filmmaking will finally see Alexander achieve the cinematic greatness that has so far eluded him.",4,1,1,29 January 2013
Troy," The gods approve
","Wolfgang Peterson's 'Troy' takes the essential elements from Homer's Iliad, fills in the gaps and creates a compelling story for audiences three thousand years later. The reason it works so well is simple, it takes to heart a lesson that Hollywood filmmakers have always known but often failed to heed ~ the characters and the story need to be larger than the spectacle.One thing the filmmakers chose to ignore was that the siege of Troy supposedly went on for ten years. In this version, the whole thing seems to be over in about three weeks. The filmmakers must have thought a full decade would slow the story down, and as the ending was going to be the same anyway, a few weeks was about right for the Trojan War.The story begins as Hector and Paris, sons of King Priam of Troy, are concluding a peace mission to King Mennelaus of Sparta. Paris falls in love with Mennelaus's wife Helen, played by Diane Kruger, whose beauty could drive men to do foolish things. Orlando Bloom as Paris proves he is just such a man, and takes Helen with him when he and Hector return to Troy. Eric Bana is terrific as Hector who takes honour and courage far more seriously than Paris. He is aware of the consequences of this action but as Helen loves Paris, decides to support his brother rather than return her to Sparta Mennelaus enlists the aid of his brother Agamemnon to get Helen back. Agamemnon, played in an unashamedly over-the-top performance by British actor, Brian Cox, uses this incident as a pretext to go to war with Troy.Agamemnon also enlists Achilles, Greece's greatest warrior. Brad Pitt as Achilles brings intensity and sex appeal to the role. It was either phallus or phalanx for Achilles, and he leaps from bedroom to battlefield with equal zeal. Achilles is a difficult and dangerous man and as is the way with such things women can't resist him. These days, he would no doubt be a Formula One driver or a rock star – it's reassuring to know some things never change.On the other side of the Aegean, Paris presents Helen to the Trojans. His father King Priam played by Peter O'Toole knows that the Greeks will invade to retrieve Helen, but is also aware that they have only awaited an excuse to do so. Hector is placed in charge of the defences, but he has done his numbers; he knows the Trojans can't win although he commits himself to the task nevertheless.The Greeks sail to Troy. Helen's face has launched those thousand ships and they are all up there on the screen. The Greeks arrive and make a bloody landing. The movie presents a number of battles. Each one introduces a new angle to avoid repetition – it's pretty much the formula that has worked so well for 'World Championship Wrestling'.Paris accepts Mennelaus's challenge to fight him for possession of Helen. They duel in front of both armies with surprising results, proving that Paris is a better lover than a fighter. Eventually the contest we have been waiting for takes place ~ Achilles versus Hector. It's a promoter's dream and lives up to expectations.The intensity of these sequences rob the final scenes of some of their impact, and the introduction of the wooden horse is decidedly anti-climatic.Historical accuracy was not the number one priority of the filmmakers, but entertainment certainly was. At two and half hours, the audience leaves the cinema with extended bladders but also with a sense of satisfaction.",8,0,1,5 February 2013
The Hustler," Hamlet of the pool hall
","Character is the word Bert Gordon, businessman and gambler played by George C. Scott, uses to sum up why he thinks pool hustler Eddy Felson (Paul Newman) is a loser. He explains that although skillful, Eddy doesn't have the character to win, and has ready-made excuses for losing rather than face the flaws within himself.It is the theme that runs through this powerful film; the game of pool tests Eddy's character but so does his relationships with the people around him, and Eddy is found wanting. He has little loyalty to others and not much for himself; his one desire is to be the best pool player in the country. Although there are a number of pool games in the film, the one that stays in the memory is the first game against reigning champion, Minnesota Fats, with Jackie Gleason's portrayal just about stealing the movie. Filmed in a famous New York pool hall, Rossen takes us into a world that is almost separate from the life of the city around it. The duel with Minnesota Fats goes for nearly two days, and draws an audience of gamblers and pool devotees. Throughout the game, Eddy is strutting and voluble. He announces his thoughts almost as though they were Shakespearean soliloquies. He is so driven that it is a performance that rivals 'Hamlet' for intensity. Paul Newman's performance goes close to being too much but it fits perfectly within the heightened atmosphere that Rossen has created. By contrast, Minnesota Fats is a model of restraint. He stays cool and goes about his game in a business-like manner. Both men drink but Minnesota Fats handles it better. He also refreshes himself from time to time while Eddy looks disheveled and beaten – the result is inevitable.Eddy meets Sarah Packard, played by Piper Laurie, who gives such a heart-felt performance that it is almost too painful to watch. But Eddy still has a difficult journey to make and it is not until tragedy takes him to his lowest point that he shows the character that Bert Gordon said he would never have.'The Hustler' is one of the best movies from a period, which I think was the most fertile for dramatic film in the history of cinema, the 10 years between 1955-1965. At the time, we took it for granted that those films would be challenging, passionate, thought provoking, and possibly even disturbing. Every era of cinema produces great movies but there just seemed to be so many good ones in the field of drama right then.Society was changing and so were films. Talented writers and directors were emerging who had cut their teeth on live television drama. Novels were adapted with subjects that challenged the established order. Plays by people such as William Inge, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller were translated from stage to screen. Hollywood was also heavily influenced by ideas coming from Europe – Italian Neorealism with the emphasis on real locations, the French New Wave, and a group of powerful dramas from Britain. Independent production was replacing the old studio system. And to see the impact Marlon Brando and 'The Method' was having on drama, look no further than Paul Newman's performance in 'The Hustler'.But there were other forces. The McCarthy era had either exiled or embittered a large group of writers and directors, a number of whom started to re-emerge towards the end of the fifties and early sixties; their screenplays and films expressing some of the pain they had endured.The other strong force was the Motion Picture Production Code. Despite the fact that filmmakers railed against it, the parameters it set actually made them more resourceful – what couldn't be shown could be alluded to with symbolism and metaphor. These factors no longer exist but they did have an affect on Robert Rossen back then. Much of what happens in 'The Hustler' was allegory for the ills he felt ailed society, and the meaning of real character permeates the film.Although there is a lot more to the movie, 'The Hustler', and especially Minnesota Fats have become synonymous with the game of pool. 'The Hustler' deserves all the praise it has received over the decades, it is a film that rewards any number of viewings.",10,0,1,13 March 2013
Spotlight," Sins of the Fathers
","If there is one thing this brilliantly-crafted film reinforces, it is that freedom of the press is essential for the democratic way of life. It shows that no organisation, even one claiming spiritual high ground, is immune from the law.'Spotlight' is very similar to 'All the Presidents Men' in the way that a small group of reporters pick up the strand of a story and follow it relentlessly until they uncover a larger, uglier truth.At around the same time as the 2001 attack on the World Trade Centre, the Boston Globe's four strong Spotlight team exposed how the highest levels of the Catholic Church in Boston covered up and protected priests who had molested children. The number of priests involved was disturbing. The Spotlight reporters eventually proved that the senior cardinal had known about these crimes for more than a decade and allowed the moving of the offending priests from parish to parish – where many of them continued to prey on children.The story is all business, not much about the character's personal lives are shown, except a brief glimpse of Sasha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdam) with her devout Nana. However each character has a well-defined personality from Michael Keaton's low-key, but considered Robbie Robinson to Mark Ruffalo's passionate Michael Renendez. Their reactions vary as they speak to victims and uncover facts that also effect them personally as most of the team were brought up Catholic.The film has plenty of tension as the reporters follow up each lead and overcome many barriers. The film avoids a sensational approach, letting the facts speak for themselves. It deals with some raw issues in a subtle but effective manner, especially when some of the church hierarchy attempt to convince the reporters that their out of town Jewish editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), has an agenda for self-advancement and a desire to undermine the church.The details within the film are still shocking. Here in Australia, the situation was almost duplicated, with members of other churches and institutions also accused of doing the same. This film resonates far and wide.Like any addiction, admitting there is a problem is the first step to finding a cure; this film may prove to be part of the process that will stop these things happening again.",8,1,2,17 June 2016
Insomnia," Afraid of the light
","Al Pacino stars in a film that features sleeplessness as a central motif. It is perfect casting. Pacino doesn't just look tired in this movie, he looks positively whacked. But he stays awake long enough to bring to life a sharply written thriller with some unexpected twists.'Insomnia' is based on a Norwegian film of the same name. The Hollywood version, directed by Christopher Nolan, relocates the story from Norway to Alaska. It is not a scene for scene remake although the basic story and a number of key scenes are retained.Legendary homicide detective, Will Dormer, Pacino's character, arrives in a small Alaskan town. He is accompanied by his partner, Detective Hap Eckhart, played by Martin Donovan. They have come to investigate the murder of a young girl. The local police and a young patrolwoman, Ellie Burr, greet them. The enthusiastic Ellie, played by Hilary Swank, is aware of Dormer's fame.Swank's character is pivotal as she realises that all is not as it should be with Pacino's character. The detectives are under investigation by internal affairs, and have come to Alaska to try to work through their problems. Dormer is troubled by the perpetual daylight of the northern latitudes. Swedish actor, Jonas Engström, played Pacino's role in the Norwegian version – but Pacino looks the tiredest! Together, the local cops and their LA counterparts investigate the crime, and a number of people come under suspicion including Walter Finch, the character played by Robin Williams.Prior to this, Robin Williams had been in some particularly cloying movie roles. However, he changed his image by playing a number of edgy and psychotic characters. Williams quickly makes the role of Finch his own and any lingering identification with the Robin Williams from 'Patch Adams' serves only to create a genuinely unsettling character.The US version gives more of a back-story to Pacino's character and his relationship with Detective Eckhart. This gives some explanation as to why Dormer does what he does. Ellie Burr's character is also more developed than the role played by Tanja Lorentzen in the Norwegian version; Swank is far more engaging.One scene that has more edge in the Norwegian film involves a dog in a crucial piece of evidence tampering – the Norwegian version is wince-inducing to say the least.Chris Nolan's team had the earlier movie as their starting point and could easily see where the story could be strengthened. However, Hollywood remakes of European films often fail to measure up, take 'The Vanishing' for example; the ending in the U.S. version is a cop-out compared to the Dutch version.The US version of 'Insomnia' also stumbles at the final hurdle, opting for a more predictable ending than the ambiguous one of the Norwegian film. The Norwegian version is also able to claim the artistic high ground as the totally original work.",8,0,1,6 September 2013
Match Point," Matchless
","There has been a lot written and said about this movie, and I can understand why; I think it is one of the most intriguing movies I've seen.With a measured pace and style, 'Match Point' tells the story of Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who marries for money and position while lusting after another woman with whom he has an affair. But when she becomes too demanding, he solves his problem in a totally unexpected way.The plot is built around the theme of luck. Meyer's character sets up the premise in his opening narration, 'The man who said I would rather be lucky than good, saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It's scary to think so much is out of one's control'.Luck also played a part in the making of 'Match Point'. In an interview Woody Allen told how he was lucky with just about every aspect of the movie. Lucky with the script, lucky that the location changed from The Hamptons in NY to London, lucky with the cast, and lucky when Kate Winslet dropped out and Scarlett Johansson was available.Would this movie have had the same frisson with Kate Winslet playing Nola Rice? It's subjective of course, but Scarlett just has that powerful, glamorous look and calm sensuality that could cause males of any age to stumble over their words. The cast praised her acting, although it's the scenes where her relationship with Chris Wilton starts to unravel, replete with yelling and screaming, where she seems a little stretched. As she herself says, 'I'm a pretty relaxed person and I don't consider myself a screamer so when you're elevated to that, it brings up all this crazy energy that you didn't realize you were bottling up.' I was actually surprised to find that about half the reviewers on IMDb hated 'Match Point', especially UK reviewers. One of the main complaints was that Allen didn't really capture a feeling for modern London life - they felt it was all a bit Oscar Wilde. However, in all the interviews I've seen or read with the mainly British cast, Emily Mortimer, Brian Cox, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Matthew Goode, none of them had anything but praise for the script, and all seemed to enjoy working with Allen. Most of the crew were also British, so up-to-date advice and local knowledge was always close at hand.Anyway, it's the terrific cast, and the story with its reverse homage to Dostoevsky that drives the movie. Those who hated it overlooked some of Allen's most insightful writing - look at the way Matthew Goode as Tom Hewitt gets over Nola, he and his family move on from her. Then, even Chris Wilton gets over her - passions cool, relationships change, love can turn to hate, or worse, indifference. Allen weaves it all into his story where the security and power of wealth are the strongest driving forces of all.All I would say is that it's a film that deserves re-evaluation. I've seen it a number of times, and each time I discover some new aspect to enjoy.",9,1,2,17 June 2014
We Were Soldiers," Soldierly virtues
","In an interview in 'Vietnam Magazine' some years ago, Joe Galloway said that although there were changes, he felt the movie of 'We Were Soldiers' was faithful to the book he co-wrote with Colonel Hal Moore, and also to the real events. Editorial comments in the same magazine indicated that many veterans appreciated this movie far more than 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Platoon'.'We Were Soldiers' is a straight soldier's story without the weird baggage that accompanies so many Vietnam War movies. No Russian roulette, no terminations with extreme prejudice, no surfing colonels. It was also a battle fought without civilians caught in the crossfire, which so defined the Vietnam War.'We Were Soldiers' is about the formation of a battalion of the US Air Mobile Division and its baptism of fire in South Vietnam's Ia Drang Valley in 1965. The story is told from the point of view of the unit's commander, Hal Moore, played by Mel Gibson. Moore's wife, played by Madeleine Stowe, also has a pivotal role in the story, which shows the impact of the battle on the soldier's families as they await news at home.Moore's battalion traces its heritage to Custer's ill-fated 7th Cavalry, and the Little Big Horn is always at the back of the modern commander's mind.Moore's men land by helicopter, and although greatly outnumbered, engage the enemy in a fierce battle. The real life Colonel Hal Moore felt the battle was a draw; US forces withdrew, but although their casualties were heavy, the North Vietnamese casualties were many times higher.Gibson's movie concentrates just on the actions of Moore's men. In his book, Moore relates how two other units were eventually drawn into the fighting. When they withdrew the following day, they were ambushed – the real events were not quite as tidy as in the movie.Gibson is fine as Colonel Hal Moore, no doubt a challenge with the real man, according to the film's publicity, a visitor to the set. Mel gives the role depth and his pain seems real when he has to order his men into situations that could cost them their lives.Sam Elliott's grizzled Sergeant Major Plumley, based on the real-life soldier, adds a role worthy to be mentioned with the great screen noncoms. Greg Kinnear as Major Bruce Crandall, who leads the helicopter pilots, also turns in a compelling performance.The film doesn't glorify war, but the sequences where the movie falls down tend to be where the filmmakers included some very standard 'Hollywood' interpretations of war.Although the Vietnamese are portrayed with respect in some scenes, in others they are mowed down mercilessly. Towards the end, many North Vietnamese conveniently move mid-camera to die in a swirl of slow motion arterial spray accompanied by Nick Glennie-Smith's dirge-like score – a hackneyed technique even by the late 1960's.These scenes create a jarring note, along with those in the beginning where the French are wiped out in a perfunctory manner. Although defeated on RC4, the paratroopers of the French Foreign Legion in particular fought with desperate bravery and deserved a little more cinematic respect. The sequence looks fake, and leaves an unfair perception.With that said, the positives outweigh the negatives in 'We Were Soldiers'.The scenes where the families of the soldiers are informed about the deaths of loved ones are genuinely affecting, and must still touch raw emotions in the people involved.Volatile politics and events such as Mai Lai have overshadowed the fact that many Vietnam-era soldiers fought actions at the small unit level that were as bloody as some of the worst battles of WW2. Gibson's movie helps balance the ledger. It shows the disproportionate price some people pay – physically and spiritually – in the service of their country. Although Vietnam is an old war now, the essential message of 'We Were Soldiers' is still timely, because some people are still paying that price.",8,0,0,14 September 2013
The Best Years of Our Lives," Window on an era
","This is one of the important movies. It was when it was first released in 1946, addressing as it did the issue of veterans returning from WW2, and the affect it had on them and their families. It focused on three men, all psychologically scarred, and one who has lost both arms. They return to a small city in the U.S., but the themes of the film were universal.That was 70 years ago, and over the years, the movie has tended to move into the background - there have been more wars and more veterans returning with their own issues.However, I think the importance of this movie can't be underestimated now that the WW2 generation is fading away.WW2 was well covered; we have millions of feet of newsreel film as well as towering stacks of history books. However, movies from the era do something quite unique; they get inside the emotions and the feelings - they represent the mindset of the time. Audiences identified with the issues through the stars in a way that was very personal. Hollywood did this job best - it was entertainment, but it was also a commitment to a generation.At the end of the war and into the 50's, Hollywood addressed the aftermath - 'Till the End of Time', 'The Men', 'My Foolish Heart', 'The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit' and others, but 'The Best Years of Our Lives' towers above them all.The film could never really be remade. It was created by people who had experienced the war either in combat or on the home front. Many behind the camera had served including director William Wyler who had flown dangerous missions making documentaries about the U.S. Air Force; he was left nearly deaf from the experience.The film tackled tough issues and attitudes. Sergeant Al Stephenson (Frederick March) returns from the Philippines, but he hasn't seen his kids for years and he seems out of step with them. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) returns to an unfaithful wife and an uncertain future, he was good at war but what now? Real-life amputee Harold Russell plays Homer Parrish. He has much to overcome, but his girlfriend remains loyal, and he emerges as possibly the best adjusted of them all; he accepts what he can't change, and just gets on with it.The film has a powerful score by Hugo Friedhofer. Friedhofer was not as famous as Newman, Korngold or Steiner but he was as good. He surpassed himself here; his music helped express the unspoken thoughts of the actors - there are sections of this score that bring a lump to the throat.This was my parent's generation; my father was in the Australian army and fought in the war. And although this movie was about Americans, the story resonated far wider.Of course you could argue that some issues were not tackled - and that also gives an insight into an era, but with that said, this film is a window on the ideas and forces that were shaping society at a critical time in modern history. Seen that way, it's a movie that may never lose its relevance.",10,6,6,3 April 2016
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick and Thackeray; on the same page
","Although the choice of stars in some movies seemed odd at the time they were made, over the years, they have grown into their roles.Ryan O'Neal in Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' is a classic example. Back in the 70's he was a pretty big star, but seemed connected to more lightweight fare. It was a surprise when he ended up in a major film from Stanley Kubrick.These days, he doesn't carry the baggage that surrounded him back then and now seems quite an inspired choice to play Redmond Barry, a brash, impulsive, Irish opportunist during the Georgian era in England and Ireland. After many adventures, he rises from lowly beginnings to become a gentleman of means, only to slide back down again in an even more spectacular fall.Along the way he marries a beautiful widow, Lady Lyndon (Marissa Berenson) and makes an arch enemy of his stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali). Kubrick wrote the screenplay from William Makepeace Thackeray's novel. Thackeray had a witty turn of phrase - for example, at one point in the novel, Redmond Barry beats the living daylights out of young Lord Bullingdon, which Thackeray refers to as 'administering a correction'. Kubrick catches Thackeray's satirical tone and the script is full of wry, Thackeray-inspired observations on the human condition. Apart from anything else, the script itself is an impressive achievement.Thackeray wrote the novel in the first person from Redmond Barry's point of view whereas Kubrick uses the voice of an anonymous narrator, speaking in the third person. Although narration can sometimes seem a lazy way of telling a story in a film, it works perfectly here; we find ourselves waiting for the commentator to put Barry's often-painful experiences into perspective.Kubrick changed the story a great deal, without losing the essential themes. I can't help feeling that in a couple of areas he actually improved it, especially the ending, which in the novel is rather meandering - instead of the decisive duel of the film, Barry's fortunes run down, and he eventually lands in prison after being given 'a tremendous castigation' by Lord Bullingdon. Kubrick tightens the whole thing and that long, final confrontation is one of the most powerful scenes in the film.This movie has a brilliant look whether indoors or out, night or day. What an amazing talent Kubrick was. Jack Nicholson once said of him, 'Everybody pretty much acknowledges he's The Man, but I still feel that underrates him'. He was a guy from New York who could embrace British literature and history, and produce such a believable work as this - it was almost as though he had Thackeray himself sitting in a canvas chair beside him acting as technical adviser.The true genius of the movie is in how Kubrick captures the period perfectly, maintains that beautifully measured pace, and yet delivers a film that is full of wit and tension from beginning to end.",10,7,11,28 November 2014
Interstellar," Introspective
","I'm not alone in noticing the similarities between 'Interstellar' and 'Contact'. Along with the space and time travel themes, there is the poignant father/daughter connection in both films. Both movies also have a spirituality, which a film such as 'Prometheus' never achieves. The effect is enhanced by their respective scores, a beautifully realised one by Alan Silvestri for 'Contact' and a stunning one by Hans Zimmer for 'Interstellar'. Indeed, this has got to be close to Zimmer's best work; it is such an integral part of the movie and helps the characters express their deepest feelings. Sci-fi movies usually fall into one of two categories; either they are special effects extravaganzas with loads of action and aliens or they are introspective, where much that happens could almost be an hallucination or caused by claustrophobia, time compression or some other phenomenon of space travel. '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Moon', 'Event Horizon' and 'Solaris' as well as 'Interstellar' and 'Contact' fall into that latter category. Like many of the old episodes of 'The Twilight Zone' and 'The Outer Limits' they depend more on mood and ideas to make their impact - in the case of the old TV shows, budget and special effects limitations no doubt forced the writers to be more cerebral. But with a big budget film such as 'Interstellar', the brilliant special effects enhance the profound and complex ideas in the story.'Interstellar' also fulfils a requirement that Sam Goldwyn once stated - it's the last 5 minutes of a movie that makes it memorable. Like 'Contact', 'Interstellar' has a haunting last 5 minutes. To be honest, both 'Contact' and 'Interstellar' are long movies and there are passages in each that make you wonder where the story is going, but the powerful final scenes of both films give all the closure needed. It would be hard to think of more emotive scenes than the last ones in 'Interstellar' - truly inspired filmmaking.Seeing 'Interstellar' made me want to see 'Contact' again. I feel they are companion pieces despite being made years apart by different people - although Matthew McConaughey is in them both. 'Interstellar' is not light fare, it's not mindless effects oriented entertainment. If you are after a movie that will stay with you long after it has finished, it's a trip into inner and outer space well worth taking.",9,1,2,26 October 2015
American Sniper," Sniper on the roof
","A book that was hard to ignore becomes a movie that is even harder to ignore.It's difficult to just review this movie without acknowledging the book and the controversy that surrounds them both.As far as I'm concerned, it would be nice if every human conflict was resolved around the negotiating table, but that is not the way of this world. As for the use of snipers, I think if the other side uses them you would be crazy not to use them yourself, and go them one better, And that is where this story fits in because it's about America's most effective sniper whose job was to protect soldiers on the ground as they fought their way through the embattled streets of Iraq.The book had a harder edge than the movie. Chris Kyle wrote it from a personal viewpoint without much reference to the rights and wrongs of the conflict. The movie tones down some of the more disparaging descriptions of the enemy with only a passing reference to 'savages'. Although the accuracy of some sections of the book have been questioned – including a court case for libel, I have no difficulty accepting its basic truth.The argument that erupted over the morality of sniping is an interesting one, especially in light of the history of America's armed forces. Sharpshooters were a feature of conflict in America from the colonial period right through the Civil War up to the wars of the 20th century and beyond when the term sniper became more commonly used. Seen that way, the Navy SEALS have built on the legacy, honing the skill to its ultimate level, epitomised in the abilities of warriors like Chris Kyle.In their anger over the movie, it's interesting that some commentators have actually called Kyle a coward, although I don't recall them being as outspoken over the other famous snipers throughout history – Vasily Zaytsev at Stalingrad for example.The movie is straightforward and polished. Bradley Cooper projects a powerful personality as Chris Kyle, and Sienna Miller complements it in the role of his wife, Taya.I think Eastwood was right not to include a couple of scenes from the book, which would no doubt have been more contentious: the incident with the Tunisians and the beach balls for instance – it may have got laughs for the wrong reasons.Eastwood also shows the price the military has paid by giving roles to a number of badly wounded veterans. 'American Sniper' shows Eastwood's skill in creating emotion with simple scenes such as when Taya watches Kyle leave for the last time with the man who is destined to kill him.With so much publicity, no one is likely to accidentally stumble across this movie and be offended. All things considered, other than the argument that war itself offends our humanity, 'American Sniper' seems reasonably even-handed in its approach.",7,1,5,3 June 2015
The Lost City of Z," What happened to the snake?
","Percy Fawcett was one those British explorers we learnt about at school back in the 1950's, but nearly all the illustrations of his trips into the Amazon showed his encounter with a 62-foot anaconda. I waited for it, but it was a no-show.It could have given the film a boost especially after all those sessions at the starchy Royal Geographical Society. However we do get piranhas. 'The Lost City of Z' is an interesting film more than a riveting one. Like the book by David Grann, the story is one long frustrating search. Fawcett, played in the film by Charlie Hunnam, was a driven man who was the first European to explore vast areas of the Amazon and South America. But his search for a lost civilisation deep in the Amazon jungle became a life-long obsession.He seemed more of an eccentric in Glann's book although in the movie you have to wonder what was going on in old Percy's head when he leaves Sienna Miller behind in England for years at a time. She plays Mrs Fawcett and although we don't have a giant snake to lift the film, we do have her.This film is beautifully photographed with authentic looking scenes and Indians. Obviously it wasn't an easy film to make, however, the various journeys are somewhat hard to follow. The film avoids old-fashioned narration but it may have helped us navigate our way a little more easily.The story takes a side trip to WW1, but like much else in the story it gives us yet more doom, gloom and mud.Eventually Percy heads back into the Amazon one last time with his eldest son; the product of one of his trips back to England. However just like Captain Cook on his last journey, Percy misreads the natives with unpleasant consequences.Films about explorers tend to be a bit glacial. This film is similar to 1990's 'Mountains of the Moon' and in both cases the books they were based on gave context and detail, while the movies struggled to be as cohesive.With that said, this film does give a very believable feeling for the times. If you can get your heart rate in sync with the 'Merchant Ivory' pace of the film then there is much to admire - even if they didn't bother with the snake.",7,0,0,29 November 2017
Southpaw," Split decision
","'Southpaw' has some powerful scenes and an eye-popping performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, but surprisingly, doesn't even try to avoid the most obvious clichés of the genre.The heart of the movie is the story of a dad who loses, then struggles to regain the custody of his daughter. Jake inhabits the tough, inarticulate character of Billy Hope, a man who has fought his way up from life in an orphanage to become the World Light Heavyweight Boxing Champion.The boxing setting is convincing – up to a point. The whole thing looks real with very believable ringside commentary and fighters who look the business, especially Jake who is superbly ripped and looks able to handle himself.However like most boxing movies, the blows the fighters rain on each other are a bit problematic. Maybe it was the sound effects in this case, but some of the hits the guys were shrugging off would have staggered a Yeti, and stopped a real bout pretty quickly – especially at the weights they are fighting at. I say this even though Billy is supposed to be a boxer who can absorb loads of punishment before delivering the winning punch.Without spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it, the story takes an unexpected turn quite early, setting up the dilemma in Billy's life. The boxing is secondary to the story of his redemption, and interestingly, the film doesn't take much of a stance on boxing either way other than when Billy's wife, Maureen (Rachel McAdams), pleads with him to stop taking the punishment he receives in the ring.In the acting stakes, Forest Whitaker gives Jake a run for his money as ex-boxer, 'Tick' Willis, who runs a gym in a tough part of town. He is an ambivalent character who doesn't always stick to his own rules. However the complexity he and the others brings to their parts helps separate this film from all the other boxing pictures we have seen – although in truth, 'Southpaw' follows the numbers pretty closely.As a boxing movie, it doesn't travel into the downbeat territory of Huston's 'Fat City' or even Wise's noir 'The Setup'. However, the powerful performances drive through the melodrama, and 'Southpaw' does win in the end even if it's through a series of jabs rather than a knockout blow.",7,0,0,14 January 2016
The Aviator," Grounded indefinitely
","Much like the 'Spruce Goose', Scorsese's film about Howard Hughes is big, shiny and taxis around for nearly two and a half hours before taking off for a very brief flight.Many actors love to play eccentric characters. However few films have successfully embraced eccentricity; eccentric characters are too self-obsessed, and disinterested in the affect they have on others to engage the audience's sympathies for very long.And so it is with Martin Scorsese's film about eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes.Although Leonardo DiCaprio embraces the Hughes' traits – the childish enthusiasm, the eccentricity and the quirky, compulsive habits – he is unable to make his character anything other than irritating.The film opens as Hughes directs his World War 1 flying movie, 'Hell's Angels', and introduces the first of many real-life characters including Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow and Jude Law as Errol Flynn. Eagerly anticipated is the arrival of Kate Hepburn played by Cate Blanchett, and it is almost a relief when she finally enters the film.Katherine Hepburn, who had a long affair with Hughes during the 1930's, also had one of the most distinctive personalities of all Hollywood actresses – her voice and mannerisms were favourites of impersonators for decades. Blanchett does an impressive job as Hepburn, wisely underplaying and not overdoing the voice. The movie slackens considerably when she leaves the story. Hughes also had an affair with Ava Gardner played by Kate Beckinsale who hardly changes gear in her characterisation.Leonardo DiCapri works hard in the scenes of Hughes' breakdown caused by a combination of external pressures, serious injuries and inner turmoil. After a series of investigations by senate committees and the FBI, the film closes as Hughes realises, just as Charles Foster Kane does in 'Citizen Kane', that no matter the power and wealth he has amassed, he no longer feels the happiness and security he felt as a child.In playing Senator Owen Brewster, who investigates Hughes' airline towards the end of the film, Alan Alda is unable to move away from his Hawkeye Pierce persona from MASH, delivering yet another variation on the Groucho Marx wisecracking style – not so much funny as relentless.Alec Baldwin is far more effective as Juan Trippe who eventually brings about the financial collapse of Hughes' Aviation enterprise.The film has a number of exciting and beautifully shot aerial sequences, two spectacular crashes and the flight of Hughes' over-sized seaplane, the 'Spruce Goose'. All helped along by Howard Shore's soaring score; by turns triumphant, elegant and questioning. It's possibly one of the best scores of the last 5 years.'The Aviator' is an overlong flight that encompasses much of Hughes' life without shedding much light on what made the man tick. Finally, if we are left with one insight, it is that the capriciousness of very rich, spoilt people can cause a great deal of annoyance to the rest of us.",6,3,4,9 February 2013
Oblivion," From the obvious to the oblivious
","'Oblivion' starts out with scope and size but shrinks through trite dialogue, too many drone battles and an actor who could have given it depth, but instead played it at his most superficial level.Tom Cruise performs this one in the hyperactive manner that was fine at the beginning of his career, but is wearing a bit thin now that he has hit the 50 mark. Warning bells sound early in 'Oblivion' when his character talks to the head-nodding dashboard figurine in his spacecraft. By the time he makes the imaginary long shot to replicate an old Super Bowl game followed by the touchdown, you know this movie isn't the new '2001'.The biggest problem is the script, and as it is partly by Joseph Kosinski, who not only directed the film, but also created the graphic novel on which it was based, I guess there just weren't enough people around to say, 'Hey man, this isn't working'. Moreover, did we really need all the repetitious, video game-like battles with the drones – even after one battle you can feel your brain starting to slide into, yesoblivion.The concept behind the movie is intriguing, and the special effects are simply ravishing – just about the cleanest and best in any sci-fi movie. The story is seen from the point of view of Commander Jack Harper, Tom Cruise's character, who narrates the story and informs us how although humans were victorious after an invasion of Earth by the alien Scavs, the planet was so devastated that mankind was forced to relocate to Saturn's moon, Titan.Jack and his teammate, Vika Olsen, played by Andrea Riseborough, man a space station above Earth in order to maintain the drones that send the planet's remaining resources to the Tet, the huge space station above Earth that is readying the human population for the journey to Titan.When Jack discovers a female survivor, Julia Rusakova, played by Olga Kurylenko, and encounters the Scavs, who turn out to be human, he learns that he has been the victim of a huge deception; the real aliens have used him to help take Earth's resources for themselves. There's a lot more to the plot with mind-washing and cloning playing a big part in the story. However, 'Oblivion' is undermined by superficialities in the script, which jumps from high-minded concepts to dialogue so juvenile that it must surprise everyone in the audience including juveniles.As Malcolm Beech, the leader of the resistance on Earth, this is the sort of performance that Morgan Freeman just about phones in. Although he explains much of the background of the story, the fantastic voice is also asked to deliver lines such as, 'That is one p***ed off weapon'. Better luck next movie Morgan.Even when appealing to a young audience, surely it isn't necessary to dumb your movie down with anachronistic jargon and out of place references to today's teen lifestyle in the belief that they won't get it otherwise? As any parent who has ever dealt with a teenage son or daughter knows, exasperatingly, they can deal with complex argument on many levels. Audiences these days understand the language of film, they can handle obscure and non-linear concepts, but they will always react to the jarring note, and 'Oblivion', despite the dazzling visuals, has more than a few jarring notes.",6,0,0,7 October 2013
The Caine Mutiny," Capsizing a captain
","I saw 'The Caine Mutiny' recently after many years – now I can appreciate more fully why it had left such a lasting impression, it is an intense drama, brilliantly acted by a dream cast, with characters of surprising depth for a glossy, studio war film of the early 1950's. Based on the book by Herman Wouk, the story follows Ensign 'Willie' Keith, played by Robert Francis, as he joins the USS Caine as a junior officer. He meets the executive officer, Lieutenant Steve Maryk, played by Van Johnson, and Lieutenant Tom Keefer, played by Fred MacMurray – both actors delivering close to career best performances.Ensign Keith also meets the captain, Commander DeVriess, played by Tom Tully. Thinking the ship sloppy, Keith is much happier when DeVriess is replaced by Lieutenant Commander Queeg, played in a show-stopping performance by Humphrey Bogart.However it soon becomes evident that Queeg has issues, and it doesn't take long for the officers to realise that he is on the verge of a breakdown. At the urging of Keefer, Maryk, who is more sympathetic to Queeg, starts to take note of the captain's erratic behaviour, Things come to a head during a typhoon when Maryk takes command to save the ship after Queeg seems incapable of making decisions.The films ends with the court martial of Maryk for mutiny where he is defended by Barney Greenwald, played by Jose Ferrer in another of the film's powerhouse performances.Humphrey Bogart is mesmerising as Queeg. Although the trial scene is the one everyone remembers, the one in the boardroom where he asks the other officers for help shows how complete a portrayal it is.Surely Van Johnson as Steve Maryk never gave a better performance. Maryk has similarities to Doug Roberts from Thomas Heggen's 'Mister Roberts'. Both Heggen and Wouk served in the US navy in WW2 and drew their characters from men they knew. Steve Maryk is brave and efficient, he is as Keefer says when introducing him to Keith, 'Steve's our fireball, the guy who gets things done; there's one on every ship'.Of all the characters, it is possibly Fred MacMurray as Keefer who is the most intriguing. Big, cynical and articulate, he has a negative slant on just about everything, especially the navy, but his bluster masks weakness, which Maryk and Keith discover to their cost. His last scene standing alone in the elegant hotel room is one of MacMurrays finest – after work like that, no wonder he became bored playing the father on 'My Three Sons'.The film stands up well today, despite the studio tank effects during the typhoon, which don't capture the weight of the real ocean. However real ships, were used extensively, and the film has considerable scope and size.In the end though, it is the vivid, very human characters that make this film so compelling even after 60 years.",9,0,1,12 February 2014
The Revenant," Bear Grylls circa 1823
","I love this period of history, and this movie gives us a feel for what it must have been like.There is something awe inspiring about that push out from the eastern seaboard of America just before and after the War of Independence. It took amazing characters to enter that vast wilderness and face its dangers including some of the most formidable warriors ever to twang a bowstring.To be honest I enjoy this aspect of American history more than Westerns, which are usually set at a later period. 'The Revenant' captures the harshness of the times and is simply an amazing looking film. The actors and the crew suffered for this one and it shows.Now with that said, there are a couple of things that did bother me. When you have watched thousands of movies over more than 60 years, your ears become attuned to language that suits the times. As Somerset Maugham once said, it has to sound right. There are a number of phrases in 'The Revenant' that jar the ear because I know they only date from a few decades back. 'The kid's been beating himself up', just doesn't sound very James Fenimore Cooper. I put this down to the fact that none of the key filmmakers were born before 1960 including the guy who wrote the book.Does it wreck the movie? Well no, but it is a point worth bearing in mind when you go to make your historical movie - maybe you need a bleary-eyed old film buff to give your script the once over. The other thing that bothers me a little is that this is based on a true story and it didn't end quite like it does in the movie. In fact it seems that the real Hugh Glass was a little more forgiving than Leo's character - but then we wouldn't have had that epic MMA fight with blades at the end.The film has plenty of wince-inducing scenes that make you wonder how they were done; the bear attack in particular. And I'll certainly take that tip about gutting and crawling into an animal carcass if I ever lock myself out of my car on a cold night.Despite the occasional anachronism, 'The Revenant' is one of those movies I will enjoy watching more than once, no doubt discovering rewarding new elements each time.",8,1,1,27 November 2016
Doctor Zhivago," One for the ages
","Although panned by the critics when first released, word-of-mouth made up for it, and 'Doctor Zhivago' became the eighth highest grossing film of all time.Many critics at the time thought the emphasis on the love story trivialised the Russian revolution. But David Lean's film didn't do that any more than the relationship between Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler trivialised the American Civil War? Instead it presented a moving human story set against a backdrop of momentous events.Robert Bolt's screenplay is a major reason why this film works so well. It is very readable in script form and stands alone from the book. Pasternak's novel has a certain pattern, but is full of coincidences with many characters connected by a force similar to six degrees of separation. Bolt and Lean retained a little of this structure, but created a far more cohesive story.It is interesting to compare the film to the mini-series made in 2002. If there is an actress who could go anywhere near to filling Julie Christie's shoes it is Keira Knightley. Despite this, and although the mini-series attempted to incorporate more of the novel, while giving more than a passing nod to Robert Bolt's screenplay, it doesn't have the indefinable magic that makes Lean's film so memorable.Maurice Jarre's score also added to the film's rich texture. Lara's theme was criticised as trite and syrupy, but ended up as one the most recognisable in cinema history. In reality, there are many facets to the score; it captures a feeling for the vastness of Russia and the turbulent times in which the film is set, but also enhances the love story at the film's heart.Audiences who saw this in theatres in the 60's were also surrounded by all the artistry that accompanied major films back then. Even in the suburban theatre where I saw it, they displayed large posters of the dramatic, painted portraits of the stars by Maciek Piotrowski who also did the seasonally inspired paintings behind the film's titles. Today's movie posters with their Photoshop montages don't really capture the nervous energy of the hand that went into the great artwork of that era.I am pretty sure it was Sam Goldwyn who said that it is the last five minutes of a movie that makes it either memorable or not. 'Doctor Zhivago' certainly delivers a memorable last five minutes.As we see Julie Christie's Lara walking away alongside a massive brick wall featuring a poster of Stalin, Alec Guiness' narration tells of her fate: 'One day she went away and didn't come back. She died or vanished somewhere, in one of the labour camps, a nameless number on a list that was afterwards mislaid. That was quite common in those days'.The words are partly Pasternak's and partly Bolt's, but the scene says more about the human tragedy of the Russian revolution than any number of slow pans over a Soviet labour camp could. That this woman's life could be thrown away so callously after we have spent the last three hours identifying with her and all the other characters makes this as powerful a moment as one is likely to see on the screen.The impact of the final scenes in 'Doctor Zhivago', combined with truly stunning visuals and career best performances by many of the stars, ensures that this film, arguably David Lean's most enduring masterpiece, is destined to live for a long time yet.",10,1,2,29 October 2013
The Alamo," Remember this Alamo?
","Was another version of the Alamo a good idea? Judging by the box office results the answer is no, but this one professed lofty intentions, to make it as close to the real story as possible, with just a few changes here and there.According to the earliest publicity, the decision to make another Alamo movie was born from the alarming state of world affairs, and the desire to remind Americans how they had made sacrifices in the past for ideals they believed in.Whatever the motivation, the filmmakers had to overcome the problem that movies set in the early 19th century are often stuffily costumed and talky. As one commentator said, the Alamo era is a bit like Charles Dickens meets the Old West.The 1960 version overcame the problem with three high profile stars – John Wayne, Richard Widmark and Laurence Harvey as Colonels Crockett, Bowie and Travis respectively. However, the makers of this version, which is beautifully crafted in every department, went for characters that seem overwhelmed by events, but in the process they may have made them a little too lacklustre. Even the music set the tone for the two versions; Carter Burwell's elegant but restrained score versus Dimitri Tiomkin's mighty opus for the 1960 version. Thanks to the movies, Australians also have a fair idea about the events at the Alamo. Like Americans we watched Fess Parker's Davy Crockett go down swinging Old Betsy, and then John Wayne go out with a bang a few years later – not forgetting Arthur Hunnicutt as Davy in 'The Last Command' who has the best line in any Alamo movie when he says to Sterling Hayden's Jim Bowie before the Mexican assault, 'They'll eat snakes before they get in here Jim'.Those earlier films inspired me to read Walter Lord's 'A Time to Stand', which still holds up as an even-handed history of the event. I also became aware of the controversy over whether Davy Crockett was executed after surrendering or went down fighting as he had done in film after film.Billy Bob Thornton plays Davy in an anti-heroic fashion. His Crockett is likable and his performance is a thoughtful one – whether it is the performance that was needed is debatable.Sam Houston, played by Dennis Quaid, appoints William Travis and Jim Bowie to defend the Alamo with a small garrison against the Mexicans. Travis is played by Patrick Wilson and although youthful looking, gives one of the best performances in the film. Jason Patric plays Jim Bowie, who like Crockett is weighed down with his status as a living legend; he also engages in an intense rivalry with Travis.The Mexican army arrives many thousands strong. Santa Anna, played by Emilio Echevarría in the manner of a demented mafia don, orders that the mission be captured and the defenders destroyed. After days of bombardment, Travis informs the garrison that they can expect no relief, and that any man who wishes to escape is free to go. None leave and the Texans are all killed during the battle – except Davy Crockett who is taken prisoner, proves defiant, and is executed.The depiction of the final battle is the most accurate of any version. Played out at night, the long sequence features a breathtaking panorama of the Mexicans closing in on the Alamo.Although the film ends with Sam Houston's victory at San Jacinto, it cannot overcome the attempts to cut the legend down to size. If this was the filmmaker's goal, they succeeded all too well. But in so doing, surely they fell short of fulfilling their expressed wish to create a film to provide inspiration during a time of crisis and stress. If they are looking for the reasons why the movie failed, it could be as simple as that.",7,2,2,4 September 2013
Apocalypse Now," When redux turns to reflux
","When Francis Ford Coppola returned to 'Apocalypse Now' in 2001, he produced more than just a director's cut – it was a veritable reworking of the original material.Up until 'Apocalypse Now Redux' the movie was generally considered to be a masterpiece – flawed – but in a category all it's own. Now, with the extra footage, it is even more flawed, and maybe not so deserving of its status as a masterpiece.Burnt-out army officer Captain Willard, played by Martin Sheen, is ordered to find a renegade Special Forces officer, Colonel Kurtz played by Marlin Brando. Kurtz has been operating outside the scope of his orders and is believed to have gone insane.Willard's journey upriver, where he is subjected to the same forces that eventually pushed Kurtz over the edge, gave this movie its resonance. The scenes added to 'Apocalypse Now Redux' prolong the journey but diffuse the meaning in a way that surprises.The greatest damage is done to Kurtz's character. That enigmatic presence has now been brought out into the light. The insights about the Vietnam War that were contained in the memorable monologue – 'the diamond bullet of clarity' – are now referred to in a number of scenes and reiterated by Kurtz in a heavy-handed reading from Time magazine. Whatever the accusations about Brando's rambling style on the release of the movie in 1979, his performance was controversial and mysterious – you just couldn't be sure if you were witnessing genius. Now we have the answer, we probably weren't. 'Apocalypse Now Redux' gives us too much information.In an epilogue to the Kilgore sequence, Willard steals his surfboard. It makes Kilgore's character more human but also diminishes him. In the original version, Kilgore's last appearance is when he makes the 'napalm in the morning' speech. The effect at the time – Vietnam was still a comparatively recent experience – was to say that no matter how tough the Viet Cong, no matter how fanatical the enemy, our side has men who are tougher, scarier and more fanatical.If the extended playboy bunny sequence was originally edited out because the filmmakers thought it slowed the movie down – they were right.The French plantation sequence doesn't really seem to fit either. Coppola wisely cut the whole thing out the first time around. Although the river journey is meant to be allegorical, it is as though the boat has sailed into the 'Twilight Zone'. The sequence is also used to extrapolate political views about the Vietnam War – the original version made its point very nicely without having to deliver a sermon.Coppola's method of working is to shoot lots of stuff, and then put it all together like a jigsaw puzzle. He enjoyed putting 'Apocalypse Now' together so much that he decided to put it together again. However by adding more, Coppola has managed to do what two decades of critics were unable to do, and that is to cut his great movie down to size.",6,1,2,10 January 2013
Dunkirk," Capturing the spirit
","For a teenager today, Dunkirk must seem even more distant than the Boer War did to my generation growing up just after WW2. For some, Christopher Nolan's film may be the most they will know about the event.But it's enough in some ways because even if it doesn't show everything that happened, maybe it goes as close as a film could to letting you know how it felt.'Dunkirk' focuses on a number of characters who are inside the event, living it minute by minute. Tommy, the soldier at the centre of the story, seems at first glance to be the antithesis of the Dunkirk legend. Maybe he fits a New Millennium sensibility rather than a 1940's one, more like a contestant on 'Survivor'. He does show initiative, but a soldier who throws away his weapon then 'helps' wounded to the rear risked a court martial in every army from the Roman Legions on. The lines of stoic soldiers waiting patiently on the beach, the enduring image of the evacuation, seem almost like a backdrop as Tommy and his mate run through them.The man who embodies the spirit to the full is Dawson, the civilian captain of the Moonstone. He is the sort of man who wins wars; the bloke who sticks to the task when others buckle under pressure; 'There's no hiding from this thing son,' he says to an officer whose nerve has cracked, all the while steering his little boat towards Dunkirk.The scenes of aerial combat look so real it makes all other depictions pale in comparison. Peter Jackson once planned to do a remake of 'The Dam Busters', but possibly Christopher Nolan would add another dimension to the retelling.
The brilliant special effects serve the story. Much of the panorama of Dunkirk is glimpsed almost incidentally from the cockpit of fighter planes or by men struggling in the water.There are surprises for anyone who thinks they know the story or have seen documentaries or other recreations of the event; it's very different to the crowded Dunkirk of 'Atonement'.An unsettling score helps heighten the tension in a film that has you holding your breath in scene after scene. This is a film that demands more than one viewing.",9,2,4,7 May 2018
Now You See Me," The closer you look the less there is
","Flashy and hyperactive, 'Now You See Me' has a fascinating premise and more layers than a babushka doll – but with maybe the most important layer missing.French Interpol agent, Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), joins forces with FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), to pursue The Four Horsemen, a group of illusionists led by Danny Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) and Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) who have stolen millions during their stage act.Revelation is piled upon revelation until the elaborate and credulity-stretching plan behind the whole thing is revealed, wrapping everything up neatly.Although it's enjoyable enough as it plays, there just doesn't appear to be that much chemistry between the characters. No one seems to click with anyone else – certainly not Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent. The only charisma on display comes from the two screen legends, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, who are really only playing variations of themselves.Whenever a long car chase is included in a film as there is in this one, I often wonder if it's to give the screenwriters a rest or because the filmmakers were worried that if they didn't charge things up the audience would lose interest and start text messaging. No matter how well filmed, automotive carnage, with a few classic exceptions, tends to relegate a movie to the by-the-numbers category.Despite all the hidden clues in the film, the filmmakers opted for some easy formulas and off-the-rack characterisations. Take away Merritt McKinney's quirky hat and Danny Atlas' full hairdo, and the characters seem to have about the same personality. Possibly a calmer approach would have allowed a little more depth to the characters, and made the film a worthy companion piece to 'The Illusionist' and 'The Prestige'.However, it looks like everyone gets to have another stab at it; a sequel is now in production with the same actors, but a different director. I will be interested to see where they take it from here.",6,0,0,9 July 2014
Zulu," A time to stand
","When 'Zulu' opened in Sydney in 1964 it had one of those big premieres that military epics received back then: searchlights, red carpet, a band and guests wearing medals. Shortly after, I took my brother to see it. 'Zulu' ticked all the boxes for us.From Richard Burton's opening narration to his listing of the names of the Victoria Cross winners at the end, we were rapt.As well as the battle, those bare-breasted Zulu girls did not go unappreciated by a couple of young lads. You didn't see a lot of that sort of thing on the screen in those days. The filmmakers obviously got away with it under the old National Geographic Magazine rule of it's OK if it's the natural attire of the culture, it didn't stop them being hot though.The film still stands up even if the censorship of the day kept it relatively bloodless. Demonstrations show what a round from a Martini Henry rifle can do to a watermelon, no doubt it would have had the same spectacular effect on a human head. An assegai in the belly would not be as clinical as depicted in the movie either. But the best bits of the film were often the tense scenes waiting for things to happen and the one where the men drown out the Zulu chant with 'Men of Harlech'. I haven't a drop of Welsh blood, but that scene always puts a lump in my throat.The film is classy. Breathtaking photography, terrific performances from top to bottom and an awesome score by John Barry; music to perform heroics by.The film was a hit in Australia, but something unexpected happened not long after. In 1966, D Company, 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment found itself surrounded by up to 2000 Viet Cong in a rubber plantation at Long Tan in South Vietnam. There were 108 of them, about the same number as the 24th Regiment at Rorke's Drift. They held off attack after attack. Instead of mealie bags they brought down artillery fire, but the fighting was at close quarters as they held their perimeter. By the time help arrived, 18 of them were dead (17 at Rorke's Drift) while the enemy lay dead in the hundreds. Controversially, there were no Victoria Crosses although more than one was earned. Years later, the company commander likened the battle to Rorke's Drift. But I wonder if while the battle was on, did it flash through the minds of the blokes who had seen the movie that what they saw depicted on the screen they were now experiencing for real?Would anyone make a film like 'Zulu' today? Possibly it would be just too un-PC. Most battles on the screen these days are fought vicariously through intergalactic stormtroopers or by the denizens of 'Game of Thrones'.However, historical rights and wrongs aside, I still think 'Zulu' rocks; it's simply an exceptional piece of filmmaking.",9,12,12,18 July 2017
The Pianist," Playing for your life
","Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist', brings home the horror of the Holocaust through one man's struggle to survive the evil that relentlessly mounts around him.Based on a true story, Władysław Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Jewish pianist who plays live music on the radio in Warsaw at the outbreak of WW2. A talented man he eventually discovers that his greatest talent may be for survival. He is not inordinately heroic, but he does take chances such as helping smuggle weapons into the Warsaw Ghetto. However, he is a witness to heroes. After being saved almost by accident from deportation to Treblinka as the Nazis clear the Warsaw Ghetto, he sees the uprising of the surviving Jews who refuse to go without a fight.Later while sick with Jaundice, he witnesses another uprising as the Poles of Warsaw battle the Nazis for the city. Polanski handles the action scenes in a masterful manner. It is as though we are viewing events out of the window over Szpilman's shoulder.Polanski has always been able to get feeling from his actors, but here he shows he can also handle a big canvas with epic scenes that can stand comparison with the work of David Lean or Steven Spielberg. It would be hard to find scenes more harrowing than the ones Polanski has recreated of the Warsaw Ghetto.It may have been tempting to have a narrator fill us in on the complex historical events as the story unfolds, but Polanski tells this story without resorting to narration; the film has more immediacy without it. Although a fair amount of exposition is delivered through the character's conversations, it is seamless and allows Polanski to incorporate touches of wit often tinged with irony into a story that is anything but light.Szpilman and his family soon discover that what at first appear to be ridiculous edicts about race segregation by the Nazis are in fact deadly serious with dire consequences for them all. Although much of this background has been covered in documentaries, movies and mini-series, it is presented here with fresh insight by Polanski.In an inspired performance, Adrien Brody's Szpilman is buffeted by fate and is almost helpless to change the course of events. However he receives help from two women who knew him from his days playing the piano on the radio: a singer, Janina, and a Cellist, Dorata, played by Ruth Platt and Emelia Fox, who confusingly look a lot like each other. In another encounter, he is helped by a German officer (Thomas Kretschmann), who admires his playing.'The Pianist' rivals 'The Pawnbroker' in telling the story of how a decent man's life is torn apart by the Holocaust, while at the same time giving a sense of the enormity of one of the most horrific episodes in human history.",9,0,0,5 January 2015
Gone Girl," Two gone girls and a guy
","Right from the beginning let me say that I loved this clever movie, which is many notches above the average thriller.However my plot hole detection antenna, fine-tuned over hundreds of episodes of 'Columbo', 'Morse', 'Wallander', 'Jesse Stone', 'Lewis', 'Silent Witness' and of course, 'Poirot' and 'Miss Marple', pinpointed an unresolved plot element, which probably would have added yet another cute twist at the end.What happened to Greta and Jeff, the two lowlifes who rob Amy at the motel? They guessed that she was hiding out, but logic would have to tell you that with all the publicity, sooner or later they were bound to realise who she was, and they would know that Desi Collins hadn't kidnapped her at her front door as she claimed.Being total scumbags, surely they would have seen the opportunity to either blackmail her or sell their story to the media. Maybe they were in jail or dead but something needed to be explained. It would have added a nice little piece of business for Amy to overcome, or at the very least the thought of the two of them still out there would have given even more ambiguity to her final look to camera. Anyway it's a nagging detail that just seemed to leave a hole in the internal logic of the film; Greta and Jeff are simply gone.Maybe plenty of others have picked up on this point, but as there are 1,076 reviews of 'Gone Girl' on IMDb as of this writing, I haven't read them all. Also to date, this point hasn't appeared in IMDb Trivia or Goofs as a plot hole.With that off my chest, I love how the story turns on its head at the midpoint. I don't think giving the big surprise away so early was a problem. After all Hitchcock did it many times in his movies, believing that the suspense came from the audience waiting to see when the protagonists will find out what is going on.Like all Fincher's films this one has a dark, ominous look; I can't ever see the guy doing comedy. I also admire the moody, atmospheric score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.Great movie all round; a clever story with plenty of layers, stylish direction and perfect performances, but there is still just that nagging little detail",8,1,2,5 November 2015
The Man Who Would Be King," No little men
","I was surprised to read that when the film was first released some critics thought that Michael Caine infused too much humour into 'The Man Who Would be King'. However, there were others who thought the whole thing was simply a brilliant return to form by director John Huston. I'm with them. The plot, based on Rudyard Kipling's short story, has two ex-sergeants of the Indian Army, Daniel Dravot (Sean Connery) and Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine), setting off from British India in the late 19th-century to seek their fortune in Kafiristan.'We are not little men', Carnehan tells Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer) before setting off on their quest, and this isn't a little movie; it has size to spare. Of course these days, 50 years later, 'The Man Who Would be King' is as politically incorrect as they come; it probably was in 1975 when Huston made it, but not so much in 1888 when Rudyard Kipling wrote the story and the British Raj still ruled.However, for those who can see it as the pure adventure it was intended to be, it is a unique experience. It has similarities with 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'. Both films feature two buddies pushing their luck outside the law, but who have each other's backs despite the occasional disagreement.As for Caine's comedy? Peachy is an irrepressible cockney who can see the irony in the worst situation; he keeps things in perspective even when Danny overreaches himself. The critics who didn't appreciate the light touch Caine brought to the film couldn't have read the Kipling story - much of the dialogue and that grandiose turn of phrase is sourced directly from there.Huston added a lot of business to the story. It's as though Kipling composed the broad notes of the symphony, but Huston added the orchestral colour.And the music? Maurice Jarre's score blends orchestral and Eastern instruments; at once mysterious, intimate and triumphant. He also incorporated the hymn 'The Son of God Goes Forth to War' set to the tune of 'The Minstrel Boy', which Peachy actually sings at the very end of Kipling's short story. It was another inspired touch in an inspired movie.Huston made more than his fair share of masterpieces including 'The Man Who Would be King'. He could also write, he could act, he could be a tyrant and he could be a charmer; one thing's for sure though, he was not a little man.",10,4,9,4 January 2017
Ex Machina," A real girl
","It just goes to show. A guy's head can be turned by a pretty face even if the body is a see-through electronic framework combined with a dressmaker's dummy.Caleb Smith, a smart computer programmer working for tech billionaire Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), is invited to his isolated home. Nathan has developed a humanoid robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he is very keen to see how Caleb reacts with her on a number of levels, especially an intimate one.However those of us trained on three seasons of 'Westworld' know that A.I. experiments that blur the lines between human consciousness and clever electronics usually end badly.The film shows what an innovative filmmaker can do with a couple of actors and an isolated location. I love the feeling of solitude in this movie with that underlying edginess driving the whole thing. Nathan's remote dwelling is almost like being on a space station with the normal world far away.Of course, the concept for this film isn't one that was just born in the digital age. Didn't Mary Shelley start this sort of thing with 'Frankenstein'? Maybe it's even down to 'Pinocchio', with Ava the robot just wanting to be a real girl.The special effects are brilliant. We totally accept Ava. She is sexy in the same odd way as was Maria, the robot woman in Fritz Lang's silent film 'Metropolis'. The weird thing is that Ava isn't really that much sexier when she puts on the top-to-toe, human nude-suit at the end.'Ex Machina' plays with the idea that as our technology develops, we may have to re-think our interactions with artificial intelligence and also what we normally think of as attractive.",8,0,1,23 May 2020
Mulholland Drive," Road subject to fog
","'Mulholland Dr.' is a journey into David Lynch territory, and the tour does not come with maps. I did not approach this film as a Lynch fan. I'm still not sure if I am one. Fans of his work feel that they are armed with the passport, or at least the code that allows them to interpret his films. However, two and half-hours pass quickly – it's compelling, but frustrating.I gained a better understanding of the story from the Internet. Some critics charge Lynch with cheating his audience and some feel Lynch has opened a new, non-linear approach to cinematic story telling.Another group of reviewers claim that the character and identity exchanges that make the last part of the movie so confusing, are totally accessible to devotees of Lynch's work. However, for the uninitiated or those unable to solve Rubik's Cube in fifteen seconds, 'Mulholland Dr.' is a road shrouded in fog.After an automobile accident, a mysterious woman (Laura Harring) finds refuge in the apartment of a young actress, Betty Elms (Naomi Watts). Calling herself Rita – from a poster of Rita Hayworth on the wall – the woman cannot remember her real name or how she came to be there. The relentlessly upbeat and perky Betty befriends Rita, and sets out to help her find her true identity.Other episodes intersect with the central story: A man in a Winkies' diner tells another about a disturbing dream he has had that took place in the diner. A hit-man is forced to eliminate more and more people while attempting to recover a book of names. Movie director Adam Kesher's life spirals out of control when he resists pressure by Hollywood power brokers to cast a particular actress in his latest movie.Betty and Rita become lovers. Following this unexpected union is a twist that gives new meaning to the word – Betty is revealed as Diana Selwyn, and Rita as her lover Camilla Rhodes.These characters had appeared in other sequences played by different actresses; Diana was the waitress at the Winkies diner, played by Melissa Crider, and Melissa George played Carmilla in another manifestation of Rita's character – surely even Lynch must have been confused. The film attempts an almost impossible task of identity swapping. The discovery of Diana's body by Betty and Rita triggers the change of characters. Betty and Rita are figments of Diane Selwyn's imagination as though viewed in a troubled dream. Diane is suffering a mental breakdown caused by her obsessive, unrequited love for Carmilla who callously discards lovers as she moves on to new ones.There really is no eureka moment when the audience realises that there has been a major shift in focus. It is difficult during a first viewing to work out exactly what happened. Is the audience cheated? Not exactly, but by avoiding anything as conventional as a transition scene, Lynch could be guilty of a certain cynicism towards the audience.Lynch asked much of Naomi Watts and she gave it. So does Laura Harring as Rita / Carmilla. A full-frontal nude scene she performs underwent an interesting change for the DVD. Lynch digitally removed her pubic area from the sequence to stop exploitation on the Internet and in response to her sensitivity about the scene. Does this reveal a controlling side of the man? If he was that concerned, a nightie from the get-go would have been an option.There is much to admire about the film. The way characters are reinterpreted and distorted in Diane's dream to create a new reality is bold cinema – it's the execution that is the problem.At one point in the film, Adam Kesher meets a character called The Cowboy. The Cowboy warns Adam that he will see him one more time if he does good, or he will see him two more times if he does bad.'Mulholland Dr.' is such a bewildering experience that I'm still not sure how many times David Lynch should see The Cowboy.",7,0,0,10 September 2013
The Imitation Game," A serious game
","'The Imitation Game' is an absorbing film, but different to what I expected.Although it tells how British mathematics genius Alan Turing developed a machine to break the Nazis Enigma Code during WW2, the film is as much about the turmoil and pain in his life brought about by his homosexuality – this in an era when to express it physically could destroy a man's reputation and land him in prison.This other aspect of Turing's life gives the film emotional depth as he comes to terms with his true nature; even the charms of Keira Knightly as his co-code breaker, Joan Clark, can't sway him from his natural instincts.The story of how the team at Bletchley Park broke the Nazi code is fascinating. Turing and his associates – the geeks of their day, boffins back then – were chosen because they possessed a variety of skills not least of which was the ability to solve complicated crossword puzzles. The tension in the film builds as they race against time to predict the movements of German U-Boats, which were strangling Britain's supply line.I remember the astonishment around the world when Frederick Winterbotham's book, 'The Ultra Secret', came out in the mid-1970's, revealing that the British were able to read top secret German codes throughout most of the war. It was almost as big a surprise as if we had learned that Hitler had actually been a British double agent all along.The story has been covered before in films and documentaries. In fact, 'The Imitation Game' is partly based on the book, 'Alan Turing: the Enigma' by Andrew Hodges, which was filmed in 1996 starring Derek Jacobi as Turing. That film focused almost exclusively on the problems in his personal life, while 'The Imitation Game' presents a bigger picture, with more of his involvement with Ultra.Benedict Cumberbatch obviously dug deep for his performance. Although Keira Knightly has been criticised as being too glamorous for the role of real-life Joan Clark, effort was made with costume and makeup to help her fit the part.You can't blame Cumberbatch for looking disappointed when he didn't win the Best Actor Oscar. Unfortunately for him it was a year of great performances, and he would have to curse his luck coming up against someone playing Stephen Hawking.'The Imitation Game' is an intriguing film about an intriguing man whose genius could not protect him from the cruel censure of society at the time.",8,1,3,30 May 2015
Prisoners," Setting free the perfect thriller
","'Prisoners' is a searing film that takes a scenario we've seen many times before and stands it on its head. The film is about the abduction of two young girls and the way it effects their families and the police who search for them. It has a circular maze as one of its central motifs, and also has a maze of a plot. As Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the distraught father of one of the girls takes the law into his own hands and remorselessly pursues one of the suspects, he becomes at odds with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who hunts down other leads.Both men work through the maze of clues from opposite directions with pieces of the puzzle slowly dropping into place. Finally it all comes together in a disturbing climax. When a thriller this good comes along, we tend to start making comparisons with the greats of the genre, Hitchcock and Polanski or more recently Demme and Fincher, but if this movie reminds me of anything it's the Dutch version of George Sluizer's 'The Vanishing'. Not so much in superficial similarities, but because both films share a quality that was perfectly summed up by British actor Brian Cox – desolation. Although Cox was talking about Woody Allen's 'Match Point', it's the lack of comfortable closure that generates that feeling, and all three films have it. With that said however, French Canadian filmmaker, Denis Villeneuve, is a man who rejects categorising. 'I'm not necessarily a thriller fan', he says, 'I didn't want to make a thriller; I'm not so attracted to genre. I thought the thriller elements inside the movie were just a vehicle for something more interesting: the dramatic and moral aspects of the story'.Although we expect Jake Gyllenhaal to stretch himself in every role; it is Hugh Jackman who really challenges himself here. As Villeneuve said of him, 'Good actors reach a point in their career where they just have an urge, an artistic need to explore new territory; they don't want to be prisoners of their own image and Hugh chose 'Prisoners' to move outside his comfort zone'. Jackman nails the part of the self-made, self-reliant man who refuses to simply accept things as they stand.Despite improvisation on the set by Villeneuve and the cast, much of the credit for the film's power must go to the script by Aaron Guzilowski.When Villeneuve was given a choice of scripts after receiving serious Hollywood attention following the release of 'Polytechnique', he chose Guzilowski's script. There are no red herrings in the story; everything in 'Prisoners' has meaning and fits into the maze. It's such a cleverly thought out plot, brought to life on the screen by Villeneuve and his crew plus a perfect cast. Although Villeneuve says he doesn't want to be pigeonholed in the thriller genre, lets hope he makes a few more visits before he hangs up the megaphone and folds the canvas chair.",9,2,3,25 June 2014
Everest," Because it's
","This film strips away much of the mystique about climbing Mount Everest. It's about the ill-fated 1996 attempt to climb the mountain, when 20 teams lined up to hit the top of the world.These days, you get the feeling that the path to the top must be littered with bits of discarded equipment, empty drink cans, McDonalds cartons, and of course, the odd dead body. Over time, the Nepalese authorities have also become worried about the amount of human waste left on the mountain – not a place for ripple soled shoes anymore – it was something Mallory and Hillary didn't have to worry about.The film is brilliantly photographed with some truly heart-stopping scenes, but it takes a while to get into the human drama. Also, when you watch the climbers struggling to survive near the summit of the world's tallest mountain, you realise why all 31 seasons of 'Survivor' were filmed in warm locales where people don't need much clothing or even none at all. In this movie, if the stars aren't buried under an avalanche of snow, they are buried under layers of parkas, jackets, vests, hoods, anti-glare goggles and sunscreen – as well as quite a few bushy beards – it's sometimes tricky sorting out who's who.The film concentrates on two teams: one guided by New Zealander Rob Hall, played by Australian Jason Clarke, and the other by American Scott Fisher, played by Jake Gyllenhaal.The teams are mainly from English speaking nations and it is intriguing to hear the variations on the language through American, New Zealand, Australian and South African accents.Emily Watson and Keira Knightley bravely tackle a Kiwi accent and both give emotion-charged performances, while Jake Gyllenhaal's laid-back almost ethereal attitude contrasts with other, more intense characters.In one group scene, the question is asked about what drives them to attempt the climb. But no one seems able to verbalise effectively what it is that makes them risk their lives and their health doing something that even in 1996 had been done many times before.The film has a powerful score by Dario Marianelli; at once triumphant and tragic. When the killer storm descends, the film hits home with scenes of sacrifice, heroism and tragedy as one by one the climbers meet their fate.There have been quite a few mountaineering movies, but this one raises the bar out of sight as far as effects are concerned – there are some scenes that make you feel you are really climbing up towards the Hillary Step – without having to worry about hypothermia, high-altitude pulmonary edema, frostbite – and piles of human waste.",8,1,2,10 February 2016
Woman in Gold," Worth its weight
","Some films that bring home the effects of the Holocaust don't necessarily feature the concentration camps or the mass executions. This film gives us another aspect in a subtle but telling way.It is based on the true story of Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren), an elderly Jewish woman living in the US, and a struggling young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), who together fought legal battles with the Austrian government to reclaim the painting of her aunt, the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer by Gustav Klimt, The painting, which by this time was considered Austria's Mona Lisa, was stolen from Maria's family by the Nazis just before WWII.The film is told in a straightforward manner with a number of flashbacks. I remember the story being featured in the documentary: 'The Rape of Europe', which turns up occasionally on the History Channel. In simple scenes 'Woman in Gold' conveys the shocking way the Nazis stole the treasures of Jewish families, many of whom were patrons of the arts.One thing the film does is highlight how beautiful Klimt's painting is. Klimt is shown applying gold leaf in one brief scene – the film whets the appetite to know more about it.Antje Traue was the perfect choice to play Adele Bloch-Bauer, she is very much like the subject of the painting. Tatiana Maslany plays the young Maria Altmann in the flashbacks. For those of us who have seen Helen Mirren's films from the time she started out until now, and remember how vibrant and arresting she has always been, it seems odd that another actress now plays a younger version of her, however they both look a bit like Queen Elizabeth.The Score by Martin Phipps and Hans Zimmer also features some of the music of Arnold Schoenberg (Randy Schoenberg's grandfather).The film does not overstay its welcome. Although much of the struggle to retrieve the painting involved complex litigation over a long period, the film covers all the main points without bogging down.This is an understated film that tells a fascinating story. Although critics seem divided, I can't see why it would disappoint anyone.",8,1,1,29 April 2016
Sicario," The emperor's new flack-jacket
","From most directors, this would be a pretty good thriller with terrific action sequences and good performances from the actors, but from Denis Villeneuve, I expected more.Where is that killer twist or the feeling that he has taken a well-worn genre – yet another drug cartel movie – and stood it on its head? He tries for a little ambiguity in the last scene, but it feels forced. The earth didn't move for me on this one.When I first heard that the man who dazzled us with 'Polytechnique', 'Prisoners' and 'Enemy' had picked this subject I wondered why? Now that I have seen it I definitely wonder why? I almost feel that much of the praise for the film is simply afterglow from his previous movies – and that smacks of the emperor's new clothes.The beginning of the film is exciting, the house of death has the flavour of 'Se7en', and I thought Villeneuve was really in the zone. Then there is the great cinematography and unique angles that almost transforms the Texan and Mexican landscapes into the satellite shots you see of Mars. The armed convoys of agents on the way to and from the raids in Mexico is reminiscent of those convoys that left the Green Zone in Bagdad on the Highway of Death to the International airport.The look of the film is superb and Jóhann Jóhannsson created an edgy score, but it's the story that goes downhill for me. Towards the end when Benicio del Toro's character cuts loose on his solo effort, if I wasn't thinking of a 'James Bond' film, it was Viggo Mortensen in 'A History of Violence'. However, that movie was based on a graphic novel – a comic book – and accepted for that. Villeneuve's movie is supposedly linked to reality and current events.Sure Emily Blunt as FBI agent Kate Macer projects a strong women who handles her tough assignments with as much focus and determination as any guy, but that can't be the point of difference for 'Sicario'; other movies have led the way in that area. The most interesting aspect of her character is the conflict she faces over the lawless methods of the 'good guys'.Drug Cartel movies have just about blown Mafia movies away. However, I am not so sure that any director has really nailed the 'Godfather' or 'The French Connection' of cartel movies yet. Other than the fact that cartel gangsters are meaner than Triads and Russian Mafia combined, I have to admit I find the level of entertainment in the subject limited. Ridley Scott crashed and burned with 'The Counselor', and although 'Sicario' is many notches above that effort, Villeneuve hasn't been able to avoid the clichés.Maybe that is reflected in the recent Academy Awards nominations where the film received well-deserved nominations for technical awards, and none for best picture, direction or story.",7,0,0,3 February 2016
"McFarland, USA"," Runner's high
","A coach inspiring a group of underprivileged kids to form a team to beat well-heeled rivals has been done before, but 'McFarland, USA' does it well. Set in the 1980's, Jim White (Kevin Costner) takes a job as assistant sports coach at McFarland High, a mainly Hispanic school in Los Angeles. However the area seems too dangerous for his wife and young daughter, while scholastic achievement and prowess on the sporting field are not priorities for the students, many of whom work in the surrounding fields as pickers to help their families. However when White realises that some of his students are strong runners, he creates a cross-country running team to take on the wealthier schools that dominate the sport. Then as White and his family get to know the people in the area, they feel a sense of belonging, which they hadn't felt before. The film builds to an emotional, uplifting climax. Although a fair amount of rearranging of the facts took place, it is reassuring to learn that the story is essentially true. The film gets its message across without being preachy. At the end, when the actors segue into the real people, the theme behind the film becomes clear; if you can engage people and focus them on a goal and build self-esteem then they are more likely to become the citizens you want. This is a movie that sneaks up on you. Kevin Costner plays it low-key. One can see how an overly effusive approach to teaching would in reality have seemed fake to students wary of anything false. Maria Bello is perfect as Cheryl Whitel it's not a big role but she lifts any film she is in. Valente Rodriguez almost steals the show as the likable Principal Carmillo. Long distance running takes on an almost mystical significance in movies. Possibly the link with cross country-running, the endurance required and the sense of achievement it generates was one of the reasons nearly all the boys in Coach White's squad went on to lead meaningful lives. A football team or a baseball team would also have had a galvanising effect, but endurance sports are different – it could have a lot to do with endorphins cutting in creating a natural high and great self-confidence. McFarland is a movie with a heart; it's a winner all round.",8,3,3,18 April 2017
Enemy at the Gates," Truth comes knocking
","Although Jean-Jacques Annaud's 'Enemy at the Gates' is an exciting and visually stunning film, you have to wonder how much of it was based on fact.Particularly those scenes of the Russian reinforcements heading towards Stalingrad under withering fire from the Germans, driven forward by maniacal commissars and an intense James Horner score. They make a hopeless attack on the Germans although many are unarmed. When the survivors fall back, they are cut down by their own machine guns because they failed to obey Stalin's order of no retreat. You might be forgiven for thinking that those machine guns would have been more useful further forward facing the Germans instead.It seems that the Russians embraced 'Enemy at the Gates' in 2001 about as warmly as the French embraced Kubrick's 'Paths of Glory' in 1958.It doesn't take much Googling to discover that the film received a deluge of complaints from men and women who had fought at Stalingrad. The veterans were upset that Soviet soldiers were portrayed as unthinking executors of the orders of their officers and viewed simply as cannon fodder; one group wanted it banned in Russia.Recent histories by Anthony Beevor and Max Hastings acknowledge that the Red Army did not shrink from executing its own men, but they also chronicled that many Russian soldiers displayed great courage, skill, and esprit de corps. Most records of the battle of Stalingrad make the point that, formidable as the Germans were, the Russians eventually outperformed them in the street fighting – only well-led and self-reliant soldiers could have achieved that.Over-emphasising certain elements at the expense of others left Annaud open to the charge that he had pandered to stereotypical views as to what motivated Russian soldiers to fight in WW2. But to be fair, Annaud didn't make a blow-by-blow account of the Battle of Stalingrad, he made an interesting, technically brilliant movie, which has an absorbing duel at its centre, and although a number of the characters are based on fact others are fictional.The film tells the story of Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), who becomes a famous sniper during the battle. A political officer, Commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), recognises his potential as a propaganda tool. As his fame grows, the Germans send their own super-sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris), to eliminate him. They play out their duel in the ruins of Stalingrad.Among other characters, is Tania Chernova a female soldier played by Rachel Weisz who brightens her drab military look with beautifully applied eyebrow liner and glossy red lipstick – running the risk of drawing too much attention in the trenches, and not just from the Germans.Sacha Filipov is a boy who befriends not only Zaitsev but also Major Konig. Of all the characters, Sacha is the most difficult to accept. He exists in the film like the boy next door – to both sides. He is involved in plans and actions that stretch credulity. He also has a perfect English accent, as do many of the actors who play Russians. I found this aspect took some getting used to with my ears finely attuned to at least six decades of Hollywood Russian accents along the lines of Boris and Natasha from the 'Rocky and Bullwinkle Show'. Bob Hoskins, who plays Nikita Khrushchev, adopts an accent that seems more seamless and Ed Harris's American accent is altogether less jarring.For those who appreciate the influence movies can have on people's perception of history, the film does pose a few awkward questions. However, one Russian observer, aware of the dissatisfaction of his country's veterans, nonetheless thought the movie shouldn't be banned because it still showed that they had won in the end, and that was the most important thing.",8,1,2,31 July 2013
War of the Worlds," Total war – almost
","At the end of the 19th Century, H.G. Wells wrote a couple of brilliant science fiction books, 'The Time Machine' and 'War of the Worlds' – both were set in the future and both were subjects screaming out to be made into movies, which, fortunately, were being invented right about then.In the 1950's, George Pal had first crack at the movies. They were entertaining, given the limitations of the special effects at the time with Pal's 'War of the Worlds' the better of the two. The film generated an impending sense of doom – despite light playing on the fishing line holding up the Martian flying machines.Spielberg's updated version keeps to the spirit of the novel while also paying a little homage to Pal's version – of course, this time round, the special effects are awesome.When H.G. wrote his story, Mars appeared about the size of a blurry orange marble through even the most powerful telescope. By the time Pal made his film, space flight was still in the future and Mars was still as good a place as any from which to launch an invasion of Earth. Not so for Spielberg, with satellites orbiting Mars and robot vehicles rolling across its surface, we know there isn't much there – certainly not aliens.Spielberg's film proposes aliens that planted latent mechanisms on Earth long before humans began to walk and talk. They only needed to be activated to begin the takeover of the planet.The film gets under way as Tom Cruise's character, Ray Ferrier, has his teenage son Robbie (Justin Chatwin), and twelve year old daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning), staying with him while his ex-wife and her new husband visit her parents in Boston.Just as Ray and the kids settle down for an awkward weekend together, the alien Tripods rise from the ground and devastate Ray's 'hood.Ray decides to leave and takes the kids, first to his ex-wife's house, and then on to Boston.After many close shaves, Ray and Rachel encounter Ogilvy, a key character from Wells' novel. Although Tim Robbins plays the part in an over-the-top manner, it is a sequence that reinforces the helplessness of mankind and gives a possible explanation for the alien invasion.When Rachel is snatched up by one of the Tripods, Ray quickly galvanises the people into collective action, and allows himself to be taken up to rescue her by depositing a hand grenade enema inside what appears to be the Tripod's giant sphincter. The resultant explosion topples the Tripod – Ray is fighting back in the best traditions of Hollywood superheroes, which also confines the movie to a more superficial level than it need have.Ray and Dakota reach Boston as the aliens begin to topple over – they have no immunity to earth's bacteria to which humans have long ago developed immunity. Before the closing scenes, Ray arrives at the home of his ex-wife's parents who turn out to be Gene Barry and Anne Robinson, the stars of the Pal version, 50 years before – it's a nice touch.Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' gives more depth to the human drama than Pal's depiction – and also Wells' for that matter. Spielberg avoided a larger view of events, except for the opening and closing narration by Morgan Freeman, who, as Cedric Hardwick had done so brilliantly in the Pal version, intoned edited versions of Wells' stirring words.Spielberg's film is fast-paced, and although it is updated to a modern setting, it captures that sense of awe that made Wells' novel so gripping.",8,0,1,29 September 2013
Love Actually," Pre-loved
","The perfect Christmas movie for the family? Well, no actually. It's too raunchy for that. Early in the movie, Martin Freeman and Joanna Page play nude stand-ins for a couple of movie stars who are about to film a sex scene. One can see why it wasn't cut out to get a lower censorship classification; it is funny in a film that is rather hit or miss.Set in the weeks leading up to and after Christmas, 'Love Actually' is not exactly a Christmas turkey, but it does serve up generous slices of Christmas ham. Created by Richard Curtis, the writer of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', 'Notting Hill' and the screenplay for 'Bridget Jones' Diary', 'Love Actually' falls short of the clever insights and the originality of those previous works, however the film's hectic structure doesn't give you time to dwell on such misgivings.The film features nine stories and a score of characters. Some of the stories are linked, but the theme of love in all its variations weaves its way through them all.In a role that predates the real tragedy that befell Liam Neeson, his character, Daniel, attempts to adjust to life after his wife dies. He is left with an eleven-year-old stepson, Sam, played by Thomas Sangster who has a crush on a girl at school. Trying to get the girl interested in Sam brings the two together. Another story features Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. They play a couple dealing with the pressures that getting older has placed on their marriage – and from the pretty young secretary in Rickman's office.The two protagonists from 'Bridget Jones Diary', Colin Firth and Hugh Grant star in separate tales in this film. Firth is a writer who heads to the South of France to escape a broken relationship only to find a more meaningful, and unexpected one. Hugh Grant offers another variation of his self-deprecating charm as the new Prime Minister of England. He becomes infatuated with Martine McCutcheon as Natalie, a caterer at Downing Street. The cheekiness of this scenario is one of the surprises of the script.Bill Nighy gets the best lines in the film as aging, burnt-out rocker, Billy Mack who is cutting a Christmas album from one of his old hits. His long-time manager and friend, Joe, helps him through the trials of a comeback. The saddest tale has Laura Lindley playing a woman who is torn between her needs and of those of her mentally ill brother.Andrew Lincoln as Mark loses the love of his life, Juliet, played by Keira Knightly, when she marries his best friend. Unfortunately, the resolution of this sequence is the least believable of all the stories.Kris Marshall is Colin Frissell, a gauche young guy who thinks his English manner and accent will work magic for him with American women – he's right.Like the story, the soundtrack is a mixed bag and features Nora Jones, Dido, and The Beach Boys. While Craig Armstrong's towering anthems supercharge the emotions, they wouldn't be out of place in a movie about final victory in World War Two.Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue just about sums up 'Love Actually' – not as memorable as some of Curtis' other rom coms but enjoyable enough while it plays.",6,0,2,8 September 2013
12 Years a Slave," Lashes the soul
","This is one of those films that leave you sitting in your theatre seat long after the curtains close and the lights go up.To say it has impact is an understatement.Set in Pre-Civil War America, it's the story of a free African American man, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), from New York who is kidnapped and forced into slavery in the South. He is held for 12 harrowing years before regaining his freedom.The things he endures and sees makes this a horror story; more shocking than any with a supernatural theme because it's true. And there's the thing, one could shield oneself from the effects of this movie if you discovered it was simply a filmmaker's exaggeration of a less sensational piece of history.However that isn't the case, it's actually very faithful to the book Northup wrote about his experiences, substantiated in large part by other sources. The things we see happen to Northup happened; the things we see happen to Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) really happened (only they were probably worse), and there really was an Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) and his wife (Sarah Paulson).As a piece of filmmaking it is hard to fault this one, and it deserves all its awards. The time and the period are caught beautifully and in many ways, the camera acts as a dispassionate observer. Hans Zimmer's score also captures a sense of the sad inevitability of it all as the tragedy unfolds.We have seen slavery from this period depicted before, but this film brings home how entwined the lives of the slaves and their white masters were – there is no sense of separation of the whites in their mansion houses from the hundreds of slaves working in the fields and living in their ramshackle quarters. The plantations shown in the film seem smaller with fewer slaves, and the two groups seem to live cheek by jowl; they know each other well. This is a film that will stay with me. Although it shows that not all the slave owners were cruel, '12 Years a Slave' demonstrates the truth of the old maxim that while power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.",9,1,2,16 June 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Wolf in a $2,000 suit
","An old adage goes that if on a certain day, everyone in the world received a million dollars, by the end of the day, ten percent of the people would have all the money.'The Wolf of Wall Street' pretty much shows how that could happen.Based on Jordan Belfort's book, this is a very entertaining movie - although probably not for those who lost their money. The film follows Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) from newbie stockbroker to head of Stratton Oakmont, the largest 'Over The Counter' stockbroking firm in the US.Along the way he has two marriages, acquires luxury homes and automobiles, a sea going yacht with a helicopter, a taste for wild office sex parties, which would put a Roman orgy to shame, and a huge drug habit. But even after the FBI steps in and everything unravels, the guy still can't help making money.The movie is loud, lewd and often hilarious; it doesn't have a boring minute.Matthew McConaughey gives a brief but telling performance as Mark Hanna who initiates Belfort into the darker side of Wall Street. He also introduces the tribal chest-thumping chant that becomes a motif throughout the film.Aussie Margot Robbie is hard to take your eyes off as Belfort's second wife, Naomi. She was also an amusing guest on talk shows when the movie was released where she told how she pulled off the Brooklyn accent, and kept the news about her nude scenes from her family for as long as possible.But this is Leonardo's movie. Although in his portrayal of Belfort, where there appears to be almost no moral or ethical boundaries, he keeps our sympathy because he can actually laugh at himself; it's a high energy performance, but with a light touch.In a way, the performance has echoes of the one he gave for Spielberg in 'Catch Me If You Can'. Despite the fact that both Jordan Belfort and Frank Abagnale Jr. break the law, their sheer audacity dazzles us. Also, both Spielberg and Scorsese have great comedic timing; they know how to deliver a punch line. If you were looking for a reason why this film works better than Scorsese's 'The Aviator', which also starred Leonardo, it could simply be the latter film's lack of humour - Hughes was eccentric but he wasn't funny.Enjoyable as 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is, at the end you can't help wondering if even half of it is true, how it is that with people like Belfort and his friends helping themselves to such over-sized slices of the pie, that the world's economy hasn't descended to the level it did in 1929. In a way, it's actually a very scary movie.",9,9,14,14 June 2014
Arrival," The answer lies within
","I love the way Denis Villeneuve tackles well-worn genres and stands them on their head. Now I expect that everything he does will be exciting and different: 'Polytechnique', 'Prisoners', 'Enemy' and now 'Arrival'.I was not so keen on 'Sicario'; it didn't quite get over the bar for me – and Villeneuve set the bar. However 'Arrival' does, and then some.Here he has taken on the aliens visiting earth with a message classic, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' – with a touch of old H.G's 'War of the Worlds' thrown in, and taken the whole thing to a new level.It's not just special effects; they're good, but they are not the whole show.When alien spacecraft arrive at many locations on Earth, linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is brought in by the military to try and communicate with them.The film is absorbing as Louise and a team of scientists slowly interpret the alien's language while also attempting to build trust. All the incidental detail seems pretty much the way you would expect humans to approach an alien arrival with some advocating a peaceful approach and others a preemptive first strike.What really makes this film hit home is it's emotional depth. Louise has had troubling experiences and these become bound up in her relationship with the aliens.'Arrival' has that same insightful quality that was at the heart of Zemeckis' 'Contact' and Nolan's 'Interstellar' and also to a degree in Glazer's 'Under the Skin'; they seem to say that the key to unlocking the secrets of the universe is found within oneself.The sense of spirituality in these films separates them by light years from most special effects laden sci-fi films. Jóhann Jóhannsson's rather impartial score also heightens the atmosphere of 'Arrival'.It's probably wrong to pigeonhole 'Arrival' as straight science fiction; one feels that Villeneuve and the filmmakers were striving for something far more profound – I think they succeeded.",9,2,7,25 February 2017
The Conjuring," Demons and dolls
","When did the movies first discover how spooky dolls could be? As well as being one the scariest horror movies for a long while, 'The Conjuring' also offers a pretty good entry in the spooky doll genre.'The Conjuring' doesn't waste any time trying to scare you, it's eerie from the get go.The movie starts by introducing two renowned demonologists, Lorraine and Ed Warren played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Famiga, as scrolling text introduces their toughest case, 'Out of the thousands of cases throughout their controversial careers, there is one case so malevolent, they've kept it locked away until now'.Although the film claims to be based on fact – there is plenty of information about it online – the movie is still a great ride on the ghost train even if you don't believe a word of it.The movie cuts between Ed and Lorraine and their daughter Judy, and the seven-member Perron family, with Lili Taylor as Carolyn Perron, who ends up getting belted around like a contestant on 'Wipeout'. The Perrons move into a large, old two-story house and start to experience strange happenings. In the best tradition of 'Ghostbusters' they call in the experts.For a while, the story moves back and forth, bringing the Warrens and the Perrons together. As the Warrens work to exorcise the Perrons of their demons, after each scare, Ed and Lorraine give lucid explanations about paranormal activity – the film is so creepy that you find yourself mentally clinging to them like a palm tree in a hurricane, but eventually, they too are swept up in the demonic activity. In the end, both families are left fighting for their sanity and their lives.Over the decades, filmmakers have learnt a lot about how to build the tension in this kind of movie. As 'The Conjuring' shows, they don't always need spectacular effects, just a darkened hallway, a flight of cellar steps or a creaking door is enough to give a sense of dread.On the scale of scary movies, this ranks right up there with 'The Exorcist' and 'The Amityville Horror' and actually has touches of both films, with even a hint of Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. If you enjoy being creeped-out by a really good scary movie then you will get your money's worth with 'The Conjuring', even if you know you are being manipulated by some of filmdom's most clichéd techniques. If you think you have seen these too many times for them to be effective, believe me, they will still have you jumping out of your seat in this cleverly-made movie.",8,2,3,8 January 2014
Prometheus," Would you like some tongue with that?
","At time of writing, this is the 2,159th review for Ridley-Scott's 'Prometheus', and I wanted to put a positive word in for this movie although I am aware that twice as many reviewers hated the film as loved it. If there is one common complaint amongst the disappointed fans it is that this prequel doesn't do justice to 'Alien'.But I think it does for the most part. In fact, I feel that the things that let down 'Prometheus' are also evident in 'Alien'. But of course, 'Alien' was ground breaking in its overall design and special effects; it was always going to be a tough act to follow.There are some brilliant ideas in 'Prometheus', especially the opening where the humanoid creature disintegrates on the edge of the waterfall, allowing his DNA to flow into Earth's oceans, sparking life. It's a neat tie-in with the Prometheus of Greek Mythology, however, God, as most of us understand him, doesn't actually feature in the movie – maybe he'll get a cameo in 'Prometheus 2'.After the opening sequence, the film leaps forward eons as a human crew traces the possible roots of our existence on a moon in a distant solar system. If anything creates the weak spots in 'Prometheus' it's the interaction between some of the characters, which was also evident in 'Alien' – both films lack humour.Funny doesn't seem to be Ridley Scott's forte. Sure, combating face-hugging crustaceans, and drooling, double-mouthed reptilian creatures is no laughing matter, but in both movies there was at least one character where a lighter touch was attempted: Harry Dean Stanton's character in 'Alien' and Sean Harris' outspoken Fifield in 'Prometheus'. The opportunity was there for a little wit amongst the gloom, instead, both characters are irritating. It's a relief when 'I love rocks' Fifield is possessed by the aliens, and although he becomes more dangerous, he also becomes less annoying.'Prometheus' expands on the effects from 'Alien'. A self-administered caesarean birth replaces the chest-burster; David, the human-like android in 'Prometheus', is more user-friendly than Ash from the earlier movie, and if 'Alien' had one severed head, 'Prometheus' has severed heads all over the place. And, we mustn't forget the alien tongue kiss, which gets a real workout in 'Prometheus'. Although derivative to a degree, I think most fans would have been disappointed if these old friends didn't make an appearance in some way in the new movie.One big theme that 'Prometheus' brings forward from 'Alien' is girl-power. Instead of just Sigourney Weaver's indestructible heroine, 'Prometheus' presents two powerful females; Charlise Theron as the tightly-buttoned Meredith Vickers and Noomi Rapace as uber-resilient Elizabeth Shaw. In both movies, the males seem to be around simply as alien tongue-fodder. It's easy to find inconsistencies in 'Prometheus', but there is also much to admire. The special effects are awesome and Marc Streitenfeld provides a score with a powerful anthem that takes a different approach to Jerry Goldsmith's ominous score for 'Alien'. Anyway, I judge a movie by how much it catches my imagination and holds my attention – 'Prometheus' ticks both boxes for me. I'm actually looking forward to 'Prometheus 2'.",7,1,4,14 December 2013
The Water Diviner," A poetic vision
","I remember the impact Peter Weir's 'Gallipoli' had on the audience in the suburban cinema where I first saw it in 1981. That battle is so much a part of the Australian national conscience that the affect of the scenes at Gallipoli was electric. Something we had only read about or heard about was brought to life before our eyes.Now Russell Crowe has made a film that is a companion to that brilliant film except this one is about the impact Gallipoli had on the families the soldiers left behind - on both sides.Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe) journeys to Turkey to search for the bodies of his three sons presumed killed during the attack on Lone Pine. Although meeting resistance from the British and Australian authorities, he is helped by Turks who were in the opposing trenches during the war.The big surprise is that 'The Water Diviner' reveals Russell Crowe as a filmmaker with a poetic vision. He has learnt his craft well during his journey through film. Directing a movie as well as acting in it is a big call, but the effort doesn't show, and he has an instinct for big scenes as well as intimate ones. Although 'The Water Diviner' heads a bit too suddenly into action-adventure territory about two-thirds of the way through, the film is beautifully made and has something to say about loss and the universality of suffering in war.Crowe intersperses his story with scenes of the Connor boys during the fighting at Gallipoli - rather than historically accurate, they are more impressions of the fighting. However, the film starts with something we haven't seen before when the Turks attack to discover empty trenches after the British and Anzacs have evacuated the peninsular. Another unusual aspect of the film is the depiction of the situation in Turkey after the war with the British occupation force and the war with the Greeks.I would never complain about Olga Kurylenko being in a movie, but her role and that of her son seems a little grafted onto the story, thankfully her relationship with Joshua is handled with restraint and even subtlety at the end.'The Water Diviner' has the same lyrical quality, sharply observed realism, and feeling for time and place that made Peter Weir's 'Gallipoli' so unique - it's a classy piece of filmmaking that touches a nerve.",8,7,17,20 March 2015
Vanilla Sky," Dreamscape Cruise
","'Vanilla Sky' is a journey into David Lynch territory without David Lynch. The plot for this film is unusual and boundary stretching, and contains more layers than Earth's geological record.The film begins with what could be a series of dreams and then develops into a series of flashbacks and flash forwards. Right from the opening scene, the audience knows the journey will not be an easy one.Tom Cruise's character, David Aames, awakes from a dream, or does he? Open your eyes is the command from his alarm clock and is a recurring theme throughout the movie as well as being the English translation of the title of the original Spanish film, 'Abre Los Ojos'. David is the heir to his father's publishing empire. He seems to lead a life of privilege and wealth despite pressure from the board of directors. David's love life is also privileged; he is having an affair with Julie Gianni played by Cameron Diaz, a beautiful model who seems carefree and independent. Although it does not detract too much from the story, David's role as publisher of three major magazines is rather superficially conceived – a Hollywood stereotype of the publishing world; not much more realistic than the 'Quality' magazine office in 1957's 'Funny Face'.When David meets Sophia (Penelope Cruz repeating her role from 'Abre Los Ojos'), he becomes infatuated. Another odd touch is the way Sophia and David draw so well, they produce portraits of each other that would have done Norman Rockwell proud, but there is no explanation for their talents. David's affair with Sophia triggers a murderous obsession in Julie who tries to kill David and herself in a car smash. David survives but is disfigured, and his life is dramatically changed. The film takes a leap forward in time to David's challenged future. David is in a mental institution awaiting charges of murder. He wears a full-face mask, which must be said, does not aid audibility. A psychiatrist, Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), attempts to unravel David's problems.Nearly all the leads play against type. Especially Kurt Russell who brings a great sense of integrity to his role as a psychiatrist. Cameron Diaz also gives her role depth.Tom Cruise plays privileged and spoilt perfectly. During the course of the film his character is assailed with facial disfigurement and a limp. These are the kind of characteristics that can lead to acting with a capital A. From 'Richard III' to the 'Hunchback of Notre Dame'; actors find it hard to restrain themselves when the heavy make-up is applied and the foot is dragged. Fortunately, Tom only succumbs occasionally to the overwhelming theatrics of it all.Unfortunately, it is the movie that cannot stay the course – before the end, 'Vanilla Sky' blinks.Unlike 'Mulholland Dr' where very little is explained, 'Vanilla Sky' introduces a character, Edmund Ventura (Noah Taylor), to explain things. The explanation is a get-out-of-jail-card. Taylor's character provides a reason for what has occurred – to a point. It is not a totally satisfying resolution. Although the denouement is unexpected and left field, those who hung in there could have expected an ending more in keeping with the human drama that had gripped their imaginations up until this point. The truth is that the script for 'Vanilla Sky' painted itself into a corner and cheated a little to get out.Despite this, 'Vanilla Sky' remains a complex, intriguing story that breaks away from easy formulas. It really does deliver something different.",8,3,5,24 September 2013
Fifty Shades of Grey," Lars von Trier on Valium
","Firstly let me say that this film was both better and worse than I thought it would be. Although I haven't read the book, the hype about the movie created expectations.Of course the whole thing is about power. When uber wealthy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) meets wide-eyed innocent Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), the film starts out as a very straightforward romance, the kind that get a couple of showings on the Universal Channel. However things soon get twisted when it is revealed that Christian is a man with particular appetites.He seduces her into a world of sadomasochistic bondage with her as the bonded. As the story proceeds, Christian gets into the swing of things and ramps up the punishment.Of course if Christian had been a balding, sweaty middle-aged man with a weight problem, Anastasia may have needed a lot more seducing, but as she begins to fall in love with the handsome, cultivated Christian she willingly gives him her trust and compliance.To be honest, I didn't find the film all that erotic – it's too posed and contrived, and Christian's workroom looks a bit like a lavish display for adult toys in a department store window.Where I found the film compelling was the way Anastasia, who for all intents and purposes is the powerless party, eventually gains all the power as Christian starts to have more genuine feelings for her. Of course that was obviously the intention of the filmmakers, because it is the only thing that stops the film from being just a soft-core exercise along the lines of 'Red Shoe Diaries'.There is a fair bit of nudity in the film although it is rather sanitised – just as well they didn't let a Ken Russell or a Lars von Trier anywhere near it.Like many people, I was intrigued to see how they would make a mainstream movie out of this. In some places the story is decidedly vacuous – just check out the names. It also has little humour, other than a couple of references to cable ties.But at the very end, it has that telling scene where Anastasia leaves, presumably a wiser and stronger woman, while Christian is left with the choice of becoming a more empathetic and feeling man or continuing to satisfy desires that will lead to an unfulfilled life.A powerful ending I didn't see coming. I hope they don't screw it up with all the sequels that are planned.",6,1,2,28 November 2015
Mother!," I want to be alone
","I can't help feeling that the story of 'Mother!' was written by someone who never got over being rudely intruded upon when they were in the bathroom.'Mother!' is chock full of phobias including some most of us can relate to with invasion of personal space the most prominent. For me it is an effective horror story until about the three-quarter mark. Then it ends up in the same kind of mess as Ben Wheatley's 'High Rise'.Writer/director Darren Aronofsky started out with a fascinating scenario. A successful author simply called 'Him' (Javier Bardem) moves to a large secluded house in the country with his pregnant wife, 'Mother' (Jennifer Lawrence). It seems they both welcome the solitude. However when he invites a stranger into their home it leads to more and more unexpected guests arriving and also the arrival of hordes of the author's fans. He seems to welcome the attention while she feels besieged.Before the script and film heads way over-the-top, there are some nicely observed touches, especially the uninvited guests who turn nasty when they are rejected, and Bardem's author who seems prepared to sacrifice just about anything for adulation and flattery. On the other hand, Mother slowly cracks up as gatecrashers pop out of every crevice.There is confronting nastiness in 'Mother!' But that's fine; it's a horror movie. What isn't fine is that it all becomes rather tedious, eventually giving way to Peter Greenaway inspired excess - 'Baby of Macon' comes to mind. At the end there is even a touch of that mother of all round-trip horror movies, 'Dead of Night'. According to an interview with Jennifer Lawrence, there is subtext in 'Mother!' including allegory for the rape of Mother Earth plus references to God as well as Adam and Eve. Signals I found difficult to receive out of the unrelenting chaos. I'm surprised we didn't end up with a Blake Edwards-style pie fight - that's what he seemed to do when he didn't know what to do next.",6,1,1,3 May 2018
Mr. Holland's Opus," Living with the sadness as well as the joy
","I can't think of too many movies that transition so beautifully over a long period of time. 30 years in the case of 'Mr Holland's Opus'.Much of this is down to Richard Dreyfuss as Mr Holland. He seems to age in an unselfconscious manner, covering not only the time span, but also the emotional range.Mr Holland starts out a little self-focused, but grows in character as he overcomes the hurdles life throws up. He wanted to be a composer, but becomes a music teacher. From an ordinary teacher he becomes a good one and then an inspirational one. His dreams for his only child are shattered, but eventually their relationship becomes stronger through adversity. As he begins to take his wife for granted, he is drawn to a young student whose freshness contrasts with the difficult period he is experiencing. However, he realises where his heart lies, and his relationship with his wife is strengthened.There are many lump in the throat moments in the film, because it's so easy to relate to. No doubt liberties were taken with some of Mr Holland's teaching methods, but the film celebrates a love of music as was Mr Holland's intention with his students.Along with the music of the era, Michael Kamen's score carries us seamlessly through the highs and the lows. I'm sure any film composer would have loved to have composed the music for the film as it is more integral to the story than most scoring assignments.Richard Dreyfuss has obviously handled some demons in his life, but he has also made some profound observations on the art of acting and filmmaking that sum it up better than just about anyone I've ever heard.His intuition and insightfulness helped him bring Mr Holland to life.'Mr Holland's Opus' captures a truth that was summed up perfectly by Elia Kazan in discussing the work of playwright William Inge, 'He had learned from his own life that you have to accept limited happiness, because all happiness is limited, and to expect perfection is the most neurotic thing of all; you must live with the sadness as well as the joy.'",10,0,1,10 December 2016
Identity," Tricks itself
","There have been a number of films that paint their characters into corners from which there seems to be no escape, only to produce a wild card to get them out, often in the form of an identity or personality shift such as in 'Lost Highway', 'Mulholland Drive' and 'Vanilla Sky'. However, I think the identity shift / multiple personality wand can only be waved so many times before it becomes not just predictable but also annoying. Movies that resolve convoluted plots in this way run the risk of cheating the audience. 'Identity' might just be the film that uses this get-out-of-jail card one time too many. The movie had me going for a while. As the credits roll, a psychiatrist makes audio notes about the case of a serial killer, Malcolm Rivers, who is to be executed the following day. Dr. Mallick, played by Alfred Molina, is attempting to have Rivers reassessed as mentally incompetent. The scene then shifts to a Nevada motel during a violent storm. Thanks mainly to Alfred Hitchcock, most moviegoers know that booking into an isolated motel on a rainy night is one of the most dangerous things a human can do – on a par with exploring active volcanoes or surfing 100-foot waves in the mid-Atlantic. A number of seemingly unconnected individuals make their way to the motel seeking shelter. Among them are characters played by John Cusack, Rebecca De Mornay, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet.After a number of murders, the survivors realise that a serial killer is picking them off one by one. At this point, the story is pretty much an updated version of Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None'. Then comes the zinger! It is established that everyone in the motel, dead or alive, shares the same birthday. How can this be? They all arrived at the motel by accident without any pre-planning. The reason is simple – they are all the same person! All the characters are manifestations of Malcolm Rivers' schizophrenic psyche. Did I slap my forehead and say how clever is this? No, I thought what a total rip-off. The story moves at a fast clip until the end. This is just as well, because the holes in the film's logic are big enough to drive a motel housekeeping trolley through.We also know from watching movies that serial killers are never guarded closely enough. There is virtually no straight jacket, prison cell, nor any medication that will keep them restrained for a whole movie. They always escape and the body count goes through the roof. Although 'Identity' puts a twist on this unwritten law, we know by this time that the filmmakers have no shame and will use just about any trick to wrap the whole thing up. The movie does provide a couple of good shocks. Sadly, although it goes for a slam-dunk at the end, 'Identity' simply bounces out of the court instead.",4,2,5,30 January 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Up to the highest height
","I knew Walt Disney's name from the time I was imprinted with 'Peter Pan' in 1954 at the age of six – I've never quite gotten over it.Each generation in turn experienced the same thing as Walt and his studio produced those amazing movies. It was 'Snow White' and 'Bambi' before me, and then it was 'Lady and the Tramp', '101 Dalmatians', 'The Little Mermaid', 'Toy Story' – dozens of them, right up to the present day – long after Walt was gone. At time of writing, 'Frozen' is the highest grossing film of all time.One who didn't share the passion of millions was P.L. Travers, the author of 'Mary Poppins'.What an emotional roller-coaster ride of a movie this is as the audience waits for P.L. Travers to finally love Walt like most of us do. The film is set around her time in Hollywood during the preparation of 'Mary Poppins', one of Walt Disney's greatest successes. She proves beyond difficult and hates what Walt and his crew are doing to her beloved character. She doesn't want songs, she doesn't want animation, she doesn't even want the colour red.As she battles Walt, her early life as a little girl in Australia is revealed piece by piece, especially her relationship with her alcoholic father who died when she was seven years old. By the end of 'Saving Mr Banks' we understand some of the forces that have shaped her life and made her so protective of Mary Poppins.Apparently it didn't quite happen as depicted here, and P.L. Travers and Walt never really had that rapport, but over time she appeared to appreciate aspects of the movie. What the story does is telescope everything into the period around the making of the film. There appears to be much truth in the movie, but it also takes plenty of artistic licence.Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks are just about perfect; these couldn't have been easy roles. P.L. Travers was such a complex character whose prissy and intimidating exterior hid a kinder, more sensitive side. Tom Hanks must have also felt the pressure of bringing Walt Disney to life for the first time on the screen.The film is full of beautiful performances: Paul Giamatti, Rachel Griffith, Colin Farrell as the father, and Annie Rose Buckley as Ginty, the young P.L.Travers. The film also pays homage to the brilliance of the Sherman brothers and the songs they created for the film – so many of them instantly recognisable.It would be carping to say that the scenes set in Australia don't really look like the actual locations. They serve the purpose of the story and represent the emotionally heightened memories of childhood.Funny and heart wrenching, it's hard to resist this film. It has a deeply felt human dimension, and explores the forces that drive creativity. Aided by Thomas Newman's beautiful score, it is almost impossible to remain unmoved as the film nears its end and 'Mary Poppins' reaches the screen.",9,3,4,14 June 2014
Lucy," When Lucy met Lucy
","There isn't a dull moment in 'Lucy'. It starts fast and finishes faster. Just as well really because it doesn't allow too much time to question the plot, let alone the science behind it all.The premise of the story is that after Scarlet Johansson's character, Lucy, receives a massive dose of the drug CPH4 into her system, her mind begins to expand until she eventually uses 100% of her brain, virtually giving her superpowers.The scene I love most is when she nears her full potential and meets her namesake, Lucy, our early human ancestor whose evolving brain capacity was apparently part of the inspiration behind Luc Bresson writing the story.The science of the whole thing is explained by Professor Samuel Norman played by Morgan Freeman – he makes it all sound so believable. One of the cleverest things in the film is the way the history of the human brain and the big concepts about mind expansion are put across with the use of offbeat film clips and old newsreels.Much of the film's appeal is down to Scarlet Johansson. She plays the part in a low-key way, despite the fireworks all around her, but whatever it is that she projects she owns the screen.'Lucy' has been compared to a lot of films including '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Matrix'; most comparisons are with modern day sci-fi epics with great special effects. Oddly however, as I watched the end of the film where Lucy reaches the ultimate state and becomes at one with the Universe, 'I am everywhere', I was reminded of the finale of an old, classic B/W sci-fi film, 'The Incredible Shrinking Man', where the hero shrinks to the point where he realises that the infinite and the infinitesimal meet and become one within the vastness of the universe.Although I'm not so sure one even needs to use 10% of one's brain to watch 'Lucy' I'm not overly critical of a movie that is so entertaining, puts across fascinating ideas so well, and has two charismatic stars going full tilt.",7,1,2,13 October 2015
Flight," Brace! Brace! Brace!
","'Flight', doesn't exactly crash and burn like the aircraft piloted by Denzel Washington, but it does hit heavy turbulence and has a tendency to stray off course.The story is straightforward enough. Denzel Washington plays Whip Whitaker, a pilot who successfully crash lands a passenger plane. Only a few people are killed thanks to his incredible skill, but he is nonetheless investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. It becomes clear that Whitaker is an alcoholic, but it is not so clear if this played a part in the accident.The film is full of odd touches and characters. Whitaker meets a girl, Nicole, played by Kelly Reilly. Nicole is addicted to drugs and booze. Although it doesn't have much to do with the story we first meet her as she gets in touch with her drug dealer.Many filmmakers seem fascinated by the drug scene, although I'm not so sure audiences share their passion. The film presents the perfect Hollywood drug dealer stereotype sprouting a lot of time-worn drug jargon.Also thrown into the blender with all the other ingredients is the beginning of an orgy (or maybe the end of one) in the drug dealer's pad, plus a little full frontal nudity and some bare butt – just to make sure everything is covered – or uncovered as the case may be.John Goodman has a role in the film as Whitaker's quirky friend, Harling Mays, who comes to his rescue, especially when he is boozed out. The performance is actually John Goodman parodying John Goodman, what it's all about is beyond me; it just reinforces the fact that this is a film full of ideas – not all of them good ones.Denzel Washington is the real reason to watch this film. He has such a powerful screen presence that he almost pulls the film together despite lapses in other areas. He is believable as the pilot who keeps his nerve and brings the stricken plane down. He keeps in character throughout; a strong man, not easily intimidated. He even sticks to his drinking despite all the pressure to stop. However Denzel Washington projects a sense of honour on the screen and it's no surprise when in the end he straightens up and flies right – a little obvious and predictable though it is.'Flight' is watchable enough as it unfolds but I think the story was actually a bit thin to start with, and a lot of extraneous material was added to pad it out. Although the critics were fairly positive about this movie, I feel it is a long way from being a great film or even a particularly good one.",6,1,3,27 February 2014
Shall We Dance," Dance therapy
","'Shall We Dance' succeeds because it avoids predictability and goes in a direction you don't expect. Richard Gere is John Clark, a lawyer who leads a safe life. His wife, Beverly, played by Susan Sarandon, calls most of the shots in their marriage, and the people in the office where he works pick on people who do not conform to the norm. Each night as John Clark commutes home on the train, he notices a woman sitting in the window of a dance studio. One night when she isn't there, he gets off the train to investigate. He enters Miss Mitzi's dance studio, and almost despite himself, enrols for lessons.Miss Mitzi's is a rather run-down establishment, and not as funky as the popular studio downtown. However, from the start John becomes involved in the lives of the other students and the teachers. Everyone at the studio is pursuing a dream of one kind or another. This is true of Jennifer Lopez's character Paulina, the overly serious dance instructor. Although Gere's character was initially drawn to the dance academy because of her presence in the window, there is no romance between them. 'I prefer not to socialise with students, she tells him, I take dance very seriously and if I was your goal, you have wasted your time'. However, she isn't, he loves his wife and he has another agenda altogether. John's wife, Beverly, suspects he is having an affair and hires a private detective.The detective quickly discovers that John is not having an affair and forces Beverly to accept that he is trying to find some hidden aspect of himself. The movie does not dwell on this element for long; the real themes of the film are discovery and fulfilment. Eventually, John goes to the department store where Beverly works and takes her away in a scene that is reminiscent of the ending of an 'Officer and a Gentleman'.Although the overly quirky Stanley Tucci as Link threatens to overbalance the story, his character becomes more rounded as the story unfolds, providing some uplifting moments when he conquers personal fears.Music is an important element in the movie and although it features recognisable standards such as 'Moon River', 'Sway' and 'Book of Love', they have been given a contemporary twist.Jennifer Lopez's character, Paulina, lives only to dance, but has been rejected by her lover and dancing partner. She is attractive enough to catch the attention of men, but is aloof and lost in her own world. J.Lo fits the role perfectly with a low-key performance that also allows her to display her genuine dancing skills.At first it is a little hard to accept Richard Gere playing a somewhat repressed man. Although he is a lawyer, he is not dominant at work or at home. However, this is probably his best performance since 'Pretty Woman', but very different. 'Shall We Dance' is an engaging movie, and the two powerhouse stars play against type, making their performances all that more effective.",8,0,1,20 September 2013
Life," When a Martian wants to hug it out
","We know the scenario, but the filmmakers set themselves the challenge of doing it better than we've ever seen it done before - and they almost succeeded.The movie is set on the International Space Station orbiting Earth. There are six astronauts including Dr David Jordan, Jake Gyllenhaal's character. They are awaiting an unmanned probe returning from the surface of Mars with soil samples. When it arrives, what at first looks like a piece of Martian snot, turns out to be the organism that wiped out life on the red planet. As it grows, it threatens to do the same to Earth if it can get down there.You can probably guess what happens if you have seen 'Alien' or 'Apollo 18'. However the effects in this movie rock; they would have to be the best ever for a movie like this. I remember back in the 1950's when you could see the fishing line holding up the spaceships - we can thank Stanley and '2001: A Space Odyssey' for the special effects leap to hyperspace; they just got better and better until now you can't believe your eyes - maybe it is proof aliens have visited Earth.However special effects can't be the whole show; the heart of the story has to be the characters. There are six of them and we get to know them a little before the Martian organism, nicknamed Calvin, starts to pick them off. I must admit I liked these guys a lot more than the crew of the Nostromo in 'Alien'; they are a classier bunch altogether and less foulmouthed. As the Martian entity grows, it hunts the crew down one by one in some truly terrifying scenes. Anyone who has battled an Australian huntsmen spider around their bedroom will identify with the plight of Jake and the guys.But a film needs to end right for it to be truly memorable, and I don't love the ending of this one. It's a bit tricky and doesn't have the weight of the rest of the film; it would have been fine for an episode of 'The Twilight Zone'.Even an ending like the one in another close encounter with Martians, 1950's'Rocketship X-M', gave more satisfying closure. Despite primitive effects and laughable dialogue, it finished with a sense of sacrifice as the surviving crew stoically accepted the inevitable. But maybe that's just me.",7,3,6,20 July 2017
Cloud Atlas," Cloudy with early fog
","Three 'visionary' directors? Was that ever going to work? It sounds like a committee to me, and the result shows it.I would have loved for this movie to have worked – there are good ideas in there – but it is over written, over CGI'd, overly complicated, and overly self-conscious. After more than two and a half hours, I couldn't wait for it to end, and it did about three times, but it just seemed to keep on going.Early in the movie, Jim Broadbent as Timothy Cavendish, telegraphs the techniques used in the movie when he says, 'my extensive experience as an editor has led me to a disdain for flashbacks and flashforwards, and all such tricksy gimmicks'. This draws attention to the internal workings of the movie, which is indeed full of flashbacks, flashforwards, and many tricksy gimmicks. In my opinion, this breaks the fourth wall; when you ask your audience to buy into the pretence of movies, exposing the pretence undermines the contract of involvement with the viewer – it was a warning sign for me.The film features a number of stories from the past, present and future. The scenarios range from a 19th century sea voyage, a futuristic, post apocalyptic society living in Hawaii, and the story of a Korean android who rebels against her masters. Other episodes range in tone from broad, not particularly funny comedy to intense drama, all showing how the actions of individual lives impact one another across time. This is hammered home with sledgehammer subtlety, mainly through narration – the film needed narration otherwise it would have been totally incoherent.Tom Hanks and Halle Berry feature in a number of scenarios. Hanks' strength is in his dependable, everyman persona, although these qualities are evident in some scenes, in others his performance seems more like a caricature. Halle Berry brings her magnetic screen presence to her roles, but she is asked to do some ridiculous things.Most challenging for me are the sequences featuring Doona Bae as Sonmi-451, the South Korean android. These are interminable and often end in gun battles seemingly inspired by the mindless repetition of video games. We now have a generation of directors that have grown up in the video game era; unfortunately, this has begun to inform some of their work. 'Cloud Atlas' probably would have worked better with some tougher decision-making and judicious editing. 'Mr Nobody', made in 2009, covers similar territory. The difference is that 'Mr Nobody' is the work of one visionary director, Jaco Van Dormael, and is an intriguing film full of charm, subtlety and a genuine sense of mystery. 'Mr Nobody' is a masterpiece while 'Cloud Atlas' is a mess.One oppressive thought is that one day there will be a director's cut of 'Cloud Atlas' that will even be longer – that's if they actually cut anything out the first time around. Although some sequences work better than others, I am not a fan of 'Cloud Atlas'. For this film to be rated too highly would lower the standard of what I think a great film should be.",4,2,7,19 December 2013
Windtalkers," Too much wind
","The premise behind this film is a worthy one. It purports to tell the story of the Navajo code talkers who served with the U.S. Marines in WW2. Unfortunately, what ended up on the screen does not do justice to those men on a number of levels.Nicholas Cage plays veteran sergeant, Joe Enders, who is recovering from serious wounds suffered in an earlier battle. He and Sgt. Ox Henderson, played by Christian Slater, are charged with providing protection during the battle of Saipan for two Navajo code talkers: Ben Yazhee (Adam Beach) and Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie).Navajos were recruited by the marines to transmit messages in their language, which the Japanese could not translate. This movie maintains that bodyguards were assigned to protect the code at all costs, even if it meant killing the code talkers to stop them falling into Japanese hands.This responsibility weighs heavily on Enders and he determines to keep emotional distance between Yazhee and himself. Nevertheless, the bond that grows between the two men provides the central story.The movie does explain the background of the code talkers; the opening of the film features spectacular shots of Monument Valley in Utah, part of the Navajo's homeland.However, the movie exhibits childish notions of combat and military life that one would have thought were well in Hollywood's past. It is as though the director, John Woo, purposely avoided viewing documentary footage of the Pacific War so as not to spoil his concept of the way it was.Towards the end of the actual battle of Saipan, the Japanese launched a massive banzai against the American forces. Woo's whole movie is like that banzai charge. U.S. Marines and Japanese soldiers charge up and down hill with the abandon of children on a vacant lot. Men are mowed down in swathes while real amputees are employed as gory casualties, however the whole thing remains unconvincing. That real-life last banzai by the Japanese isn't even featured in the film (it fell mainly on U.S. Army units), but in a movie such as this, it would hardly have stood out from the rest of the frenetic action.Modern day audiences probably have little knowledge of the Saipan campaign, so quibbles of a historical nature do not indicate the root cause of the film's failure. This has more to do with scenes that utterly destroy its credibility. When Enders has Yazhee dress as a Japanese soldier so they can infiltrate the enemy position, it's about as believable as this sort of thing ever was in Saturday afternoon serials and B westerns.Coinciding with the movie's release, President Bush paid homage to the surviving Navajo veterans in a ceremony at the White House. Cast members and crew from the film were in attendance. The sentiment was right – pity about the movie.",5,0,2,4 February 2016
Spectre," Stirred, but not shaken
","For my money, the 24th James Bond film ticks nearly every box: solid story, great arch enemy, good heavy, kick-ass heroine, interesting locations, homage to past Bonds, a nice balance of the physical and the cerebral, and a touch of wit as well as a little darkness.All the usual elements have been stirred, but not to the point where they no longer feel like genuine Bond. Director Sam Mendes has a good handle on the franchise and continues to give the films depth.I like the way Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) is introduced into the story, he was always the best Bond Villain anyway. 'Spectre' also heralds a changing of the guard back at MI6, but Ralph Fiennes as the new M has gravitas to spare. And Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) has developed into a hotter, stronger character – the perfect foil for Bond.If I have a criticism it is that the presence of Mr. Hinx (Dave Bautista) and the action at Blofeld's headquarters are over very quickly. By the time Bond and Madeleine Swann escape Blofeld's brain zapper, and the facility blows up, about 3 minutes has elapsed. Of course Bond has had plenty of experience taking out facilities, but this one is over and done with in less time than it takes to pour a martini cocktail.Mr Hinx could have hung around longer as well, he is even more imposing than Richard Keil as Jaws, and the fight on the train is better than the one in 'To Russia with Love'.Totally on the plus side, Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) is one of the best Bond heroines, and has Bond's back during that train fight. She survived at the end of the movie so maybe she will do an encore later. Blofeld also survives and is bound to be back, maybe next time in a Nehru jacket with a Persian cat on his lap. The best Bond movies always do a bit of globetrotting and 'Spectre' opens out with sequences in Mexico, Morocco, Italy, London and Austria, although it always helps to have a side trip to the Bahamas.It's the tight stories and scripts that are keeping the Bond series alive. They died a bit in the Roger Moore/Timothy Dalton era when they became too silly, but ever since Daniel Craig took over in 'Casino Royale', James Bond has received the kiss of life.To my way of thinking, 'Spectre' sits pretty high in the lexicon. Not quite up there with 'Casino Royale', but stronger than 'Quantum of Solace' and a little more satisfying than 'Skyfall'.",8,0,5,12 April 2016
Joy," Joy?
","The funniest lines in 'Joy' were used in the trailer – both of them.However the trailer doesn't really give much of an idea as to what the film is about, and it's hardly a straight-out comedy – it's hard to pin the film down to a single genre.Joy Mangano (Jennifer Lawrence) struggles to make a better life for her two young children and herself, although circumstances conspire to drag her down. When she invents a simple but effective household device, she enters into the world of mega merchandising. At first this brings even more anguish to her family and herself until, through sheer perseverance, things finally start to go her way.The film has as many heavy-handed touches as it does inspired ones. If 'Joy' wasn't based on the life of a real person – I have a wardrobe full of her Huggable Hangers – the plot of the film would seem more dysfunctional than the way Joy's family is portrayed. But with that said, Jennifer Lawrence does give an amazing performance.The film crams in almost too much, and has trouble settling into a consistent mood until about halfway through.We get the extreme quirk of Joy's family, nearly all of whom live with her. Her mother has withdrawn from life and stays in her bedroom watching television; her ex-husband, Tony, and then her father, Rudy (Robert DeNiro), live in her basement – despite the fact that they hate each other. Maybe it was all true; although you would think situations like that only turn up in movies to provide very contrived comic relief.The movie starts to click into gear when Joy gets involved in the manufacturing and marketing of the product she has invented. She encounters many hurdles. Bradley Cooper makes an impact as Neil Walker, a telemarketing guru who gives Joy the chance to make it big, although his constant referencing of Hollywood moguls as role models is just another odd touch in a movie that has plenty of them.'Joy' is an interesting movie rather than a captivating one. However anyone planning on an appearance on 'Dragon's Den' or 'Shark Tank' may find Joy's struggle to get her inventions across the line an eye-opening experience.",6,0,1,26 May 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Wears its heart on its sleeve
","Mel Gibson wound the clock back in making 'Hacksaw Ridge'; it reminded me of 'Sergeant York' with Gary Cooper. Back then, films could wear their hearts on their sleeves and 'York' was loaded with emotion and sentimentality.The treatment in 'Hacksaw Ridge' is in a similar vein to that 70-year old film. Although it might be considered too syrupy in our more cynical age, I think Gibson may have caught the spirit of Desmond Doss. To perform the deeds that he did, Doss must have been working on raw emotion – appealing to God to help him save one more.Although many of the technical aspects of the film can be questioned, the emotional and sentimental heart of the movie seems about right.The film was made in Australia with a combination of American and Aussie actors. I think it's fair enough that Australia pays a little homage to Americans who fought in the Pacific in WW2. Australia owes a big part of its survival in 1942-43 to the U.S. Much of the brilliant mini-series, 'The Pacific', was also made here.Gibson admitted that he changed some things to drive the drama and also because they seemed unbelievable. However proving truth is often stranger than fiction, the surreal looking scenes of Doss and his comrades climbing the net hanging from the cliff really happened – although the filmmakers apparently added about a third to its height.As for the film being anti-Japanese? The hatred between the Allies (Americans, Australians and British) and the Japanese during WW2 was rivalled only by that between the Germans and the Russians. Pearl Harbour was still fresh in American minds and the death marches and massacres of prisoners by Japanese soldiers were known by then. The film is honest about the feelings at the time.The film smacks of a labour of love. Desmond Doss was a real man and he did even more than was depicted in the film. Although the film takes plenty of artistic licence, the essential truth comes through. I think you just have to take 'Hacksaw Ridge' as it comes – with all its emotion and sentimentality.",7,1,3,4 April 2017
The Great Gatsby," Wherefore art thou Gatsby
","An idiosyncratic Australian filmmaker takes on an American classic.It's a famous story through another lens, but it is a story so rooted in a certain time and place that it has proved elusive for filmmakers.But with that said. Baz Lurhmann's 'The Great Gatsby' demands attention. What he did for 'Romeo + Juliet' and 'Moulin Rouge' were just warm ups for this movie.Baz Lurhmann cuts loose with the effects as we knew he would and as he probably should; this is the fifth film version of the story (counting a silent one), and a straight retelling of the tale would have been superfluous, but despite torrents of tinsel, stylised sets and spraying champagne, the story of the enigmatic Jay Gatsby and his love for Daisy Buchanan still has to hit us on a personal level.I think Jay Gatsby does emerge thanks in large part to Leo DiCaprio, but it takes until about the halfway mark before we can see through all the distractions to get a handle on him.As in the book itself, there is a long build up to Jay Gatsby's first appearance - like the build up before Captain Ahab appears on the quarterdeck in 'Moby Dick'. Oddly, the first view of Leo in the role reminded me of Alan Ladd as Gatsby.All the film versions use narration to varying degrees, and Lurhmann dips into the prose often, following the book more closely than one would have expected, especially the way Daisy disappears from Gatsby's life towards the end. I think Toby Maguire also hits the right note as Nick Carraway, the teller of the tale, although he gets through a lot more business than in the novel. Lurhmann's version brings out the unevenness of the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy - more so than in the 1948, 1974 or 2000 versions. Gatsby has never forgotten her and has become almost obsessive, but she has moved on.Daisy takes the easy options and avoids confrontation, whereas Jay is impulsive and daring and doesn't mind confrontation at all. Cary Mulligan is close to the best film Daisy Buchanan - not as highly strung as in Mia Farrow's portrayal.1922 is now far away, but the conflicted emotions surrounding Gatsby and Daisy still strike a chord. I think this is Baz Lurhmann's best film, and Leo DiCaprio hasn't hurt his reputation at all with this portrayal.",8,0,1,5 July 2016
The Martian," In whose face?
","When Matt Damon's character utters the words, 'In your face Neil Armstrong', I immediately thought, 'Whoa, hold it right there'; 'The Martian' just broke the fourth wall.I couldn't get over the sudden flash that Matt Damon was an actor on a sound stage, who was probably waiting for the lunch break where a team of caterers would have prepared a meal to the star's explicit dietary instructions. Neil Armstrong on the other hand, was a man who put it all on the line to land a flimsy spacecraft 240,000 miles away on the surface of the moon. He was one of a band of extraordinary men who really did what this movie pretends to do.Maybe it was the script, but someone should have questioned the reference; it just comes down to a simple matter of respect.That aside, 'The Martian' has a fascinating premise: after being accidentally left behind on Mars, a lone survivor, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), uses his ingenuity to survive until rescued in a desperate mission. However, I feel the film has a sterile edge it didn't need to have.The movie it most reminded me of was Robert Zemeckis' 'Castaway' where Tom Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, also scienced the sh*t out of his environment when he was stranded on an uninhabited island in the Pacific. The big difference, other than being set on different planets, is that 'Castaway' has more heart. Chuck Noland has a back-story that eventually leads to scenes of reunion and parting that are heartbreaking. Also, look at the power of the scenes in 'Interstellar' when Matthew McConaughey's character interacts with his family when he is light years away in space.'The Martian' is more all business with some rather forced one-liners. There is slickness to the whole thing that works against emotion. Watney has little back-story other than one reference to his parents. He is such an insular guy he may as well have been a replicant.But the film has interesting detail, great special effects and it does have tension. If the film has a heart it's actually in the scenes of the crew on the Hermes and back at NASA as they try to figure out how to rescue Watney – scenes that owe more than a little to Ron Howard's 'Apollo 13'.The rescue at the end packs a punch. However I still feel the film could have hit harder than it does. Although it's a return to form for Ridley Scott, it's more brittle than movies such as 'Blade Runner', 'Gladiator' or the underrated 'Kingdom of Heaven'. At the very least, it might help erase memories of 'The Counselor'.",7,1,4,11 February 2016
From Here to Eternity," From literature to lens
","I read the novel long after I first saw the movie. There were surprises; it's so different it came as a shock.It's almost as though screenwriter Daniel Taradash and director Fred Zinnemann worked from a few plot points and invented the rest. Doubtless they dissected the book quite analytically, but much that is in the film wasn't in the book or was considerably rearranged.In the book, the characters are more complicated; more flawed; they argue and even tire of each other before the end. The movie tidied things up.James Jones' novel was based on his experiences in the pre-WW2 U.S. Army based in Hawaii. 1953's censorship stopped many of the novel's themes from reaching the screen. Along with the gambling, anti-Semitism and racism, there was the interaction between the soldiers and Honolulu's gay community. The long sequence in the novel where Prewitt and Maggio head off to a gay bar to sponge money and booze from a couple of older gay guys went AWOL in the script.It's a brick of a book with the characters projecting James Jones' worldview on just about everything. The raw look at the lives of the tough pre-war regular soldiers gave the book its clout, especially the treatment handed out in the stockade, but every episode seems drawn out. The filmmakers dismissed a platoon of characters to shape the brilliant screenplay.The cast stays in the memory, Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, Deborah Kerr even Ernest Borgnine as Fatso Judson, but especially Montgomery Clift. For me, he was America's finest actor. Even after his face was smashed and his life fell apart, he could still give performances such as those in 'Judgement at Nuremburg' and 'The Misfits' - Brando was wary of his talents. In 'Eternity' he was at the top of his game.There is another version of 'From Here to Eternity', the mini-series starring Natalie Wood, William Devane and a Steve Railsback. It's not bad and contains more from the book - the gay guys finally report for duty and we go inside the stockade. However it also used scenes from the 1953 film, which were not in the book including the bottle vs knife confrontation between Warden and Fatso Judson.James Jones didn't like the movie. I love the movie. The book is harder to love, but it made me want to read 'The Thin Red Line', a sequel of sorts.",10,0,0,3 July 2020
