Lucky Number Slevin," Totally Predictable and Disappointing
","I was quite excited at the prospect. #1. I love gangster movies and #2. it has a cast with impressive CV's. What looks good on paper and previews doesn't always materialise in feature length. Story is predictable and dialogue is lazy and in places cringe worthy. Josh Hartnett is flat and unconvincing, Lucy Lui gives it a try but she's just annoying. The supporting cast were reliable but it was just wrong to hear substandard lines coming out of the mouths of likes of Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley. It proves that it takes more than big names, a babe, action and violence to make an enjoyable movie. I wouldn't waste the minutes of your life watching this. You could be doing something so much better.",4,18,42,11 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," George Lucas Light Show
","Roll up, roll up to see the George Lucas light show. Look what I can do with my computers boys and girls? Isn't it great? When will Mr Lucas remember how the balance of the action and special effects plus the story, the drama, the tragedy and triumph in episodes IV, V and VI were what made the first trilogy so amazingly powerful. Not forgetting some of the performances he got from his cast: compared to Christiansen, who was a huge disappointment.Unfortunately, in the age where we have been given The Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter - our imaginations are being pulled in all directions. We not only get thrilled by visual effects, we think and feel story lines. We identify with the characters in their make believe worlds.I do realise that this project was ambitious. Lucas had his work cut out, to make the prequels and bring the story together. I feel in some ways, this has been a success (hence the 6/10). But as I sat in the cinema for that length of time to see III, I just wanted it to be over. It lacked intrigue, struggle and drama. Without those, it was just like the longest computer game advert ever.",6,15,27,1 June 2005
