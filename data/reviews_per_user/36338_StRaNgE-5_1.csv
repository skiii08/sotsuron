The Blair Witch Project," The most realistic movie I've ever seen.
","Like almost everyone, I was dying to see this movie since I first heard about it.  Some people I have talked to didn't really like it that much, but I won't let that bother me.  I loved the movie.  It was unlike anything I'd ever seen before.  It was a low-budget movie ($50,000 to be exact), but it was better than most of the really high budget movies.  It was the best idea ever for a movie and the myth was so believable, unlike the crappy plots most horror movies have.  It wasn't a blood-gusher and you never really saw anything scary, yet it was frightening realistic.  At some points you felt as if you were there with the students.  I give this movie a 10 on my scale of cool crap.  See this movie.  It may be the best movie of 1999.   A must see.",10,1,2,7 August 1999
