The Longest Yard," Utterly Retarded even for Adam Sandler
","Adam Sandler is a funny guy but this film doesn't live up to his better comedies, such as Anger Management and 50 first dates. It's OK if a movie is ridiculous as long as it makes you laugh, but this movie is just not funny. It's too ridiculous. There is no storyline...The plot is just about getting ready for the football game. I never saw the original movie so I can't really compare the two. As for the acting, it's not that the acting is bad...it's that no one has to act. The best part of the film is the opening scene where Adam Sandler insults some police officers and gets into a car chase. The rest of the movie is just to silly to be taken seriously and failed to make the audience laugh outloud. There is no character development at all and the characters' actions are not realistic as well. Not many good things about this movie.",1,6,12,18 October 2005
