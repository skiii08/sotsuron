The Devil's Advocate," It was ok I guess
","I've not seen too many horror movies, which is probably the reason why didn't enjoy the movie that much and felt it was weird. The plot was actually decent and I was intrigued throughout, It was just the explicit nakedness where I find the movie weird and getting a little bit less intrigued. There was not many horror moments in the movie as well which was disappointing for me, and I just found the whole ending weird. For me, when I do watch horror movies, I like to see a lot of horror moments, which this movie didn't have unfortunately.",6,0,3,21 June 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not as good as volume 1, but decent
","This compared to volume 1 has far less action and thrill. It was more about explaining and learning more about the whole situation. The plot was good, but it got more interesting towards the end of the movie. There was a few actions scenes which were ok, but not as good as volume 1 and they didn't last long enough. The ending was a bit disappointing as I expected more action; it was such a anticlimax. The story was good, but I wish it had more action scenes like in volume 1 which I found fantastic.",7,0,1,29 April 2019
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Prefer this over the first 2 movies, which is probably strange
","Well I liked this movie very much which I didn't expect as I didn't like Catching Fire for some reason. The plot was very good and kept me intrigued throughout the whole movie; it also was pretty straightforward, unlike the first 2 movies which could be confusing at times. It's probably my type of movie where it has good drama, which is probably why a lot of people reviewing don't like this movie as there's no games taking place, plus there's not much action compared to the first 2 movies, which I was fine with. This movie has made me really look forward to watch part 2 and I hope its just as good, if not better than part 1.",8,0,0,26 August 2019
It," Good movie, not that scary but still good
","This is a good horror movie, I didn't get scared at all, but there a few times when I cringed. The plot was intriguing, although during the middle it kind of got a bit boring, but after that it got really intriguing and thrilling. One thing I liked about the movie is the good relationship between all the characters which made it very interesting and sometimes funny to watch. I see this movie getting criticised, mostly by the users saying that it wasn't scary enough; I think that's probably because its stars mostly kids and they probably have rules about how intense the horror scenes must be when it involves kids.",8,0,0,22 July 2019
Training Day," Decent
","It wasn't the most exciting movie, but it was good enough to keep me interested. I thought the plot was decent, it was a bit hard to follow at times as I didn't understand some of the lingo, but I understood what was going on. I thought the action scenes were great, I wish it had more of those as it would've made the movie a bit more thrilling. To me, the movie felt like more of a drama than an thriller. It's not the best movie, but it's definitely a movie that I would rewatch.",7,0,0,1 June 2020
John Wick," Not an all-out action-packed, movie but still great.
",Great movie filled in with some good action scenes and an intriguing story right from the start of the movie. What i liked about this movie is that the action scenes were not long and over-dramatic which fit perfectly with the mood and theme of the movie. I recommend anyone to watch this movie you won't be disappointed unless your the type of person who likes to watch over-dramatic action movies lol.,8,0,0,1 December 2018
Se7en," Se7en does not get a 7 for me
","I'm not a huge fan of these types of movies and have not seen many of them, which is probably the reason that I didn't enjoy that much. Don't get me wrong the plot was good, not sure about the ending though which I found unnecessary, but the movie is full of unnecessary murders anyway. The movie lacks the intensity and climax for me, especially at the beginning of the movie where I wanted to stop watching the movie. Its probably my personal preference why I don't like the movie, but I personally believe a dark movie like this needs more thrilling moments to make it more intriguing.",6,1,5,13 April 2019
The Big Lebowski," Disappointed with the last half of the movie
","Ok the first half of the movie was great and I was really starting to get intrigued into the story, but after that it wasn't that intriguing at all. All the thrill from the first hour of the movie did not carry on through the movie and it started to get a bit boring during the middle-part. I was expecting something exciting to happen towards the end of the movie, but it didn't happen; it was such an anti-climax. I also didn't like how the plot twists were presented to easily and how it lacked any sort of drama. For me the movie could have been better if it had a better ending.",7,2,5,15 April 2019
Memento," Intriguing, unique movie
","This is a good movie with an interesting plot that was in reverse-chronological order, which it made it a bit more intriguing. I found the plot easy to follow for the most part up until the end where I got a bit confused, and had to read the plot on Wikipedia to understand what clearly happened. I felt the ending could've been explained better by showing how the wife actually died and show it clearly. Other than that the movie was good and it's definitely up there with the best drama movies I have seen; I would definitely recommend watching this movie to anyone.",8,0,0,30 March 2020
Inglourious Basterds," Decent movie
","It was a decent movie which is a fictional parody of the events that took place during world war 2. I found most of the movie intriguing, however i found myself getting a bit bored during some scenes; probably because it was in another language and was a bit hard to follow. I also felt the movie was unnecessarily a bit too long. I was also expecting a lot more action scenes during the movie, but most of the action comes during the end of the movie which was good. Overall, its was a good movie, but not one that keeps me intrigued throughout due to the few long and less interesting scenes.",7,1,5,24 April 2019
The Hunger Games," Good movie, certain aspect of the movie I didn't like
","This is a good 'last one to survive' movie, similar to the game mode battle royale. The plot was good and was intriguing through out the whole movie. I like how it doesn't go straight to the action, rather it builds up to it which I liked. The action scenes were good, although I wish there was more, especially with the contestants fighting each other. One thing I didn't like about the movie is how the people in charge of the game were involved in the game itself and trying to manipulate how the game goes. Like starting a fire and unleashing beasts; what's that all about? I just wanted the contestants to fight without any help and influence from the people in charge. Other than that, the movie is pretty good and you should definitely watch it.",7,2,3,12 August 2019
The Irishman," Probably is a great movie, but I'm too stupid to understand it
","I found it a bit hard to understand the plot because I ain't clever enough too and I'm not used to watching these types of movies. I'd say I enjoyed the first hour or so of the movie, but after that it got too complex for me and I wanted it to end. No matter what the genre is, 3 hours and 20 minutes is a bit long for a movie. I've seen a similar movie to this which was Goodfellas which I did like, but even that I found hard to understand at times. Overall, I found it decent and I liked the characters, but it was not a good experience for me for the reasons I stated above.",6,2,5,9 December 2019
Blade," Wouldn't like to watch this again
","The movie was very mediocre which I was kind of expecting to be honest. I didn't find the plot very intriguing and wanted to stop watching the movie after 20 minutes in. The action scenes were decent, however the CGI was bad which was expected from a movie from 1998. I'm not into all of the vampire stuff which was one of the reasons I didn't like the movie as I find it weird. I also thought the character of Blade could've been portrayed a bit better because I didn't like him for some reason.",5,1,3,3 February 2020
Deadpool 2," It was ok
",It was a decent movie i guess. The movie just didn't have me on the edge of my seat for some reason. It did have some funny moments and good action scenes but the story just didn't interest me as much.,6,1,2,16 October 2018
Ready Player One," Decent insight of the future
","I don't usually watch science fiction films, but this one was good. I felt like it gave us a good insight of what the future might be like and how obsessed people might be with VR technology. The plot was good and intriguing and the CGI was great as i expected. It might be hard to follow at certain points if you're not really into these types of movies like me, but i definitely recommend anyone to watch it. Also, I was surprised to find out that this movie was mostly filmed in my hometown of Birmingham, England which is cool.",7,0,1,15 February 2019
Ocean's Twelve," Not good enough like the first one
","This movie tries to make the heist more realistic and complex than the one in Ocean's 11, but it fails. In doing so, they made the movie less intriguing and confusing at times. This movie definitely has more funny moments than Ocean's 11, but that doesn't matter as it's not like it is a comedy movie. I see what they was trying to which was to make the heist look less easy, but it just lacked the thrill.",6,1,1,11 March 2019
Snatch," Good, funny crime movie
","This is how crime/action comedy movies should be. The plot was good and really intriguing; It had great action scenes along with some funny moments which just makes the movie better. I like how it had two main plots which actually makes it more interesting to watch as you don't clearly expect what will happen. As a Brit, I felt this movie portrayed the British culture and crime world well and it doesn't feel like an overdone American-style crime/action movie like some movies based in the Uk tend to be.",8,0,1,8 April 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Good movie
","It was a surprisingly good movie about racial issues. It wasn't too politically correct which i thought it was gonna be and the plot was interesting and intriguing; there were no boring parts in the movie. Im not a huge fan of drama movies, but this one was good; i recommend anyone to watch it especially if you're interested in movies based on serious issues.",7,4,6,28 December 2018
Ocean's Thirteen," Too dull
","Well this was a very dull movie which tried to be like Ocean's 11, but it ended up being even worse than Ocean's 12. The plot was just not intriguing and there was a lack of action scenes. It got a big intriguing in the last 40 minutes of the movie where the heist (If you could call it that) was actually happening. The build-up to it was just boring and a bit confusing. Don't watch this as its probably the worse movie in the Ocean's series, even worse than Ocean's 12 which at least had a bit of excitement in it and was a bit intriguing.",5,0,0,16 March 2019
Forrest Gump," Really intriguing movie
","Watched this movie today and it's just another great drama movie. The plot was just very good and had you intrigued throughout. There's a lot of funny moments, but also some sad moments which were perfectly balanced and made the movie interesting. This is up there with the best drama movies that I have seen such as Shawshank Redemption. You should definitively watch this if you haven't done so.",9,1,1,3 April 2019
Nightcrawler," Not the most thrilling movie, but it was decent
","Interesting movie about a guy who tries to capture footage of crime scenes. I thought the plot was decent; it was simple and straightforward and didn't have much surprises. I thought the few actions scenes in the movie were good and made the movie a bit more thrilling. I was a bit intrigued while watching the movie, but it was just not that thrilling until the end of the movie where it got a bit more enjoyable and something happend at the end which I did not expect.",7,0,0,25 May 2020
Léon: The Professional," Good dark movie
","This is another good movie released in the year 1994. Its a very dark and serious movie which was really intriguing to watch. The plot was good and there were some action scenes which were decent, but I wish it had more. I watched the longer version of the movie and there were some scenes in it which were kind of weird to watch because it involves a little kid and it would probably wouldn't be politically correct today. Overall, its a good movie, more of a drama, but it has a very interesting story.",8,2,4,9 May 2019
Bird Box," It was alright, not the best but not that bad
","Like most people i only watched this movie because everyone is bloody talking about it where half the people saying its good and the other half say its crap. I found the plot of the movie good and it had me intrigued until the end. I haven't watched many horror or thriller movies, so this movie compared to others is probably ain't the best hence the negative reviews. Just watch it and you might like it.",7,0,5,3 January 2019
The Bourne Identity," It's alright, not very thrilling though
","The story was ok, but It wasn't very exciting and it didn't keep me that intrigued. The action scenes were good, they could've been longer and probably should've been more of those types of scenes in the movie. One of the problems with this movie is that it's not very thrilling compared to other assassin movies likes John Wick; I felt like the movie had a dull tone to it.",6,1,3,19 June 2019
The Italian Job," Just an average heist movie
","The movie was ok, not bad but not great either. The plot was ok, but I felt the movie got a less bit interesting during the middle part of the movie and it lacked any exciting moments. The action scenes were actually good and were quite exciting to watch. It felt like a basic heist movie and it didn't have anything in the plot that would make it unique from the other typical heist movies.",6,1,2,21 May 2019
American Psycho," What was the point of this movie?
","I just didn't get this movie at all; I tried to like the movie but I couldn't. I thought the beginning of the movie was actually okay even though the story wasn't clear, but as the movie went on the plot just didn't make any sense and felt weird which made me feel uninterested. I thought there was going to be a lot of horror and gruesome senses , but there were only like a couple. I don't understand what happened at the end of the movie and I don't think I'm the only one. I liked the theme of the movie, but for me the movie didn't have an intriguing plot.",4,4,6,6 April 2020
We're the Millers," One of the best comedies
","This is up there with the best comedy movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. This movie is about a pot dealer who decides to create a fake family so that he can go to Mexico to smuggle in a shit ton of weed back into the US. I won't go into too much detail but things don't go to plan and there is a lot of action that takes place. There are many funny moments and even moments that will make you die of laughter. All the actors where great especially Jenifer Aniston, Emma Roberts and Will Poulter.",9,2,6,23 October 2018
Now You See Me," Decent, but didn't understand parts of the movie
","The movie had an interesting concept of using magic to commit crimes and the plot was intriguing at most times. The problem is that certain parts of the movie were hard to follow and you need to be really focused when watching the movie, which I wasn't to be honest. I also didn't quite understand what happened at the end with the plot twist. I thought the action scenes were good, but some of the magic tricks felt unrealistic even though I hardly know anything about magic.",6,1,3,24 February 2020
American History X," Good movie about a uncomfortable topic
","This is a good movie about a reformed neo-nazi who tries to make sure his younger brother doesn't follow in his footsteps. The plot was intriguing throughout, especially with all of the scenes not being linear. The plot is simple and doesn't give too much detail of how exactly Derick became a neo-nazi, which I actually think would've been interesting to know. I also wish we saw the aftermath of the events that happened in the end which would've been interesting.",7,0,0,7 October 2019
Ocean's Eleven," Good heist movie
","I've not seen many heist or crime thriller movies, but this one was good. The plot was decent and I liked the build-up and planning of the heist which felt mostly realistic I felt. There were a few twists here and there, but not much to intrigue the audience which is probably one thing I felt the movie lacked. But overall the movie was still good and I liked how they preformed the heist, which didn't feel unrealistic like some other heist movies.",7,0,1,6 March 2019
Tropic Thunder," It just didn't appeal to me
","The plot of having actors working on a war movie being put into an actual war zone was a great idea, but I felt it was implemented poorly in this movie and probably shouldn't have been a comedy movie. I just felt that the plot was stupid and lacked intensity. There were a few intriguing moments, but the movie got less interesting as it went on. I would've like to have seen more moments when the cast actually thought they were shooting a fight scene, but it was actually a real fight scene; that would've made the movie more intriguing and probably more funny to me. There were a few funny moments, but not enough and some of them were just stupid to me and not funny at all.",6,0,6,11 April 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Weird movie
","I guess I'm not used to these weird types of movies considering it has gotten good reviews and ratings. I would say after the first 15 to 20 minutes of the movie I became disinterested and wanted to stop watching the movie because I knew I wouldn't like it. The only good thing about the movie for me was that I thought the action scenes were decent, but they were a bit too over dramatic. Personally, I mostly just like to watch movies that make sense and are realistic, so this movie is definitely not for me.",4,1,3,16 March 2020
The Usual Suspects," Barely understood the plot
","Well I just did not understand this movie at all for some reason. There was too many names and I didn't know who most of them were, along with the complex plot which was a bit hard to follow. Basically after 40 minutes in I did not care and wanted to stop watching the movie. It's a high-rated movies so its probably just me and I was a bit tired, so I probably wasn't prepared to watch a movie which I had to focus a lot in. One positive is that the action scenes were good I guess.",4,1,6,10 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Good movie
","Just watched this in cinema today and i'm not disappointed. First few minutes were slow, but it gets very intriguing after that. Most of the action scenes come towards the end of the movie and they were very good, but I wish it had more or lasted longer. I felt the story was good and made sense, but there's probably some cliches or plot holes that I don't know about lol. It's a good movie, not the greatest movie ever like some people say, that's The Shawshank Redemption for me, but it's still one of the best action movies and worth a watch.",8,1,4,4 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Good movie, mixed feelings about the ending
","Warning this review will contain an important spoiler. I was wondering if I was going to like this movie beforehand, and I did. It had a great, intriguing plot which is definitely similar to another Toy Story movie about a toy getting lost, but it had unique twists to it. I'm not sure about the ending though; I don't like the idea Woody has left all his friends behind, especially the ones who have through a lot with him in the other movies like Buzz and Jessie, but I guess he can be happier now that he's got someone to love. However, I wish it was Jessie instead of Bo Peep especially with what they went through in Toy Story 2, but I guess it doesn't really matter that much. It's not good as Toy Story and Toy story 2, and I think Toy Story 3 is just a bit better, but this is still a good movie.",8,0,2,23 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," One of those weird drama movies
","I did actually find the movie interesting and I liked the characters, but I don't quite understand what the plot was about. It just basically told the story of the days in the lives of some actors and apparently certain parts of the movie are actually true, which I didn't know when watching the movie. There's not much action in the movie until the last 30 minutes, which was quite interesting I have to say, and I didn't know why that scene was happening until I read the plot after watching the movie.",6,0,2,30 December 2019
Django Unchained," Not what I expected, but still good
","Good plot which had me intrigued during the whole movie even though It ran a bit too long for what I prefer. I was expecting the movie to show more of what the slaves went through and how they suffered, similar to 12 Years a Slave. I thought the characters were portrayed very well in the movie, however I thought Jamie Foxx's character was a bit too cocky at times and that didn't feel realistic considering the time that the movie is set in. The action scenes were over the top, which I liked as it made the movie a bit more interesting.",8,0,0,18 May 2020
Drive," Decent
","The movie was decent, but it could have been a bit better. For example, the first 40 minutes was dull, which I guess was done deliberately due to the drivers personality, but It wasn't fun too watch. The plot gets very intriguing after that with some good action and twists. However, I was expecting something interesting happening in the end, but that wasn't the case for me. This is more of a drama movie with a good story and a few action scenes which were also quite good. Don't expect it to be an action-packed movie though.",7,1,2,1 May 2019
A Quiet Place," Certain parts of the plot felt flawed
","This was not a very enjoyable movie to watch for me, not just because of the silence which I'm not used to, but also because of the questionable aspects of the plot. For example, why would you want to bring a baby into a world where you have to be silent or else you'll be viciously killed? The first 40 minutes of the movie was boring and didn't interest me at all. It got a bit interesting afterwards, but it still wasn't intriguing that much. It wasn't scary at all which I expected to be honest. I also wanted bit of a backstory of how all the drama started which would've been a bit interesting. Overall, it's not the worst movie, but the plot could've been a bit more clever and well thought .",5,0,1,17 February 2020
8 Mile," Good intriguing movie
",This is a good movie with a very intriguing plot about a guy from a tough background with an exceptional talent. The plot was told well with some action and rap battle scenes which were really good and sometimes funny to watch. I like these types of drama movies about people from tough backgrounds trying to accomplish something and this was definitely portrayed well and realistically in the movie I felt.,8,1,1,25 May 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I love this movie, I don't know why, but I just do.
","This is movie is unusual, but it works for me. It kept me intrigued from the beginning with the plot which is not entirely clearly, but that made it more interesting for me. There's a lot of action in the movie which I found excellent and enjoyed a lot. It might not be realistic, but its a movie so it doesn't have to be. The plot is amazing and I can't wait to watch volume 2 soon because of how intriguing volume 1 was.",9,24,30,26 April 2019
Jerry Maguire," Didn't like it that much, only watched it because of the meme
","I thought this was going to be one of those classic 90's movies that I would like, but it wasn't. The plot was decent in the beginning, but got boring and weird as the movie went on with all the pointless and uncomfortable love scenes. The plot wasn't very intriguing either and made me want to stop watching halfway through. I only decided to watch this because of the 'Show me the money' meme, and also because the new movies that I want to watch are not available yet with subtitles on the internet, which I would like to clarify, I do stream legally lol.",5,1,3,30 September 2019
The Dark Knight," Good superhero movie
","Well I finally decided to watch this today and I should've done so earlier. I'm not a big fan of Batman, but I enjoyed this movie a lot. It had a good plot along with some great action scenes which made it into a very intriguing movie. What I liked about this movie is that it wasn't over-dramatic like other superhero movies; It was intense and felt real. I would definitively recommend anyone to watch it if you haven't done so, but surely most people have.",9,0,0,21 March 2019
Taken," Good, simple action movie
","The plot was very simple, but it was very intriguing along with good action scenes which mad the movie thrilling and entertaining for me. I felt the story was well sequenced and had a good build-up to the end fight scene. This movie shows that you don't need a big and complex plot to create a decent thrilling action movie.",8,1,1,3 June 2019
Groundhog Day," Good, fun movie
","This was a very interesting movie about a guy who relives the same day everyday. The plot was good and kept me intrigued throughout and there were also some few funny moments in the movie. It's a bit similar to The Truman show in a way. This movie shouldn't be taken seriously to explain why (Warning spoiler ahead) he kept living the same day, although I also wanted an explanation of that as well. It probably would've been a lame explanation anyway.",8,2,3,28 June 2019
Reservoir Dogs," A different perspective of heists
","A good movie that isn't like most other heist movies,as its about a heist that goes wrong. The plot was intriguing, even though there wasn't many action scenes which to be honest I wish it had more, but the dialogue was good and sometimes funny which made it enjoyable. I also wish to have seen the actual heist which would have been interesting, but still it was a good movie.",8,0,0,19 April 2019
Don't Breathe," Good intense movie
","I was expecting this to be a horror movie, but it isn't as there's barely any scary moments. However, I still enjoyed the movie as the plot was very intriguing and it was full of intense moments which made the movie very thrilling. There's also a few twists in the movie which makes a bit more interesting even if it does or doesn't help which side you're supporting in the story. Apparently there's going to be a sequel for this movie which is interesting, and I hope its as good as this.",8,1,2,25 July 2019
Sicario," Good at the beginning, then it just gets boring
","I'd say the first half of the movie was very intriguing, but after that it just drags and I wanted the movie to end so badly. The problem with the movie is that it's too slow paced and can make you feel uninterested during parts of the movie. I thought that the action scenes were okay, but I wanted to see more action from the last scene where they go into the tunnel. Overall, for me the movie is just too slow which can easily make you uninterested.",5,3,5,2 March 2020
Pretty Woman," Good movie which shouldn't be taken seriously
","This is a good movie about a prostitute and a business man who fall in love. The plot was intriguing from the beginning when they first meet and its all good from there. There were a few funny moments in the movie, maybe there could've been more, but I felt like this was more of a drama movie. People would definitely get offended by this movie today, but it's just a movie which was made many years ago.",8,0,1,17 June 2019
The Disaster Artist," Good biographical film
","I don't know why i decided to watch this film; I just watched it without knowing the plot or not being aware its a biographical film. I don't want to give to much spoilers, but basically its a biography about a eastern European guy who made a movie that is considered one of the worst movies ever called 'The Room' and it shows his journey of producing it.It was a really interesting movie that gave an good insight of how that movie was made (If most of the movie is truly accurate). I don't know why some people are giving such negative reviews; It's based on some bad and disastrous events which were portrayed well i felt. I would definitely recommend anyone to watch it if you're into biographical or drama movies.",7,0,0,23 February 2019
Zombieland," Good zombie comedy movie
","I wasn't sure whether I was going to like the movie and I hoped it wasn't going to be one of those lame horror-comedy movies, but that wasn't the case at all. I enjoyed it from start to finish and found the plot very intriguing, there was no dull moments. There was also some funny moments, especially from Tallahassee and there were a few twists which made the movie more interesting. This is up there with the best action-comedy movies I've seen and can't wait to watch the sequel when it's available online.",8,0,0,28 October 2019
The Departed," Good movie as it went on
","It was a bit hard for me to understand what was going on in the first 50 or so minutes in the movie, but after that I started to understand the plot which was intriguing throughout the movie. If I watched the movie again, I would obviously understand that part of it better and possibly give it a higher rating which is a shame. The movie was filled with good drama, along with good action scenes towards the end of the movie. I was kind of disappointed with the stuff that happened towards the end of the movie, as I thought it was unnecessary and wasn't deserved to certain characters.",7,0,0,21 October 2019
Die Hard," Good classic 80s action movie!
","I watched this movie for the first time today and it was time well spent. The action scenes like the shoot-outs and explosions were great and thrilling. The plot was intriguing and there was never one moment when it got boring. I know compared to the action movies of today this probably ain't anything spectacular, but for its time its a good action movie and i'm sure the action movies of today use this movie as inspiration. However, i still prefer the 80s classic First Blood over this, but that's just my preference lol.",7,0,0,1 February 2019
12 Years a Slave," Interesting historical movie
","I liked watching this movie and found it very intriguing throughout, even though it's about slavery and definitely had some scenes of torture and nudity which can be tough for some people to watch. It was a bit hard to understand what was being said because of the old English, but I understood mostly what was happening. Overall, It's a good movie and you should watch it if you're into drama movies and don't mind watching torture scenes which includes nudity. PS: Why are there so many reviews below made on the 31st October?",8,0,1,11 November 2019
Joker," Better than I expected
","I thought I was going to find this movie to be a bit too weird, but I actually liked it. It was very intriguing throughout, even though it was a dark movie. I like how the how the character of the joker is portrayed, although I found the dancing to be a bit weird. One downside of the movie and I'll try not to spoil the movie as much as I can, but how is it possible that anyone can bring a gun into a TV studio? Other than that, this is a great drama movie and probably up there with the best. I see some users giving this a low rating; I assume they were expecting this to be action-packed or they can't handle the dark tone of the movie.",8,4,8,20 January 2020
Con Air," Decent action movie
","This is a decent movie with an interesting plot and some decent action scenes. It had a decent plot that was intriguing at times, but one problem was it lacked the thrill during the middle of the movie, after the hijacking of the plane. It could've been a bit better if it had more action during the middle part of the movie. Still it was a pretty decent action movie, not as good as Speed, but definitely better than the diabolical Speed 2 which also came out in 1997 lol.",7,0,0,13 May 2019
It Chapter Two," Liked most of the movie, except the ending
","I actually liked chapter 1 and I was eager to watch chapter 2 and It didn't disappoint for the most part. The plot was very intriguing and kept me engaged up until around 2 hours, and the ending ruined it for me. I felt the last scene with It just didn't have any logic and it wasn't thrilling. Also, I didn't find the movie scary, just like chapter 1 which I did expect to be honest. The movie was probably a bit too long for my liking, especially with that ending. Overall the movie is decent, but a better ending could've made the movie great for me.",6,0,1,6 January 2020
The Green Mile," Wasn't sure about the fantasy aspects of the movie beforehand, but it was actually good
","This is a good movie with an intriguing plot about an innocent prisoner who has magic powers. I'm not a fan of movies that are 3 hours long, but this movie is an exception and it didn't feel like it was that long. I knew beforehand that this was going to be a fantasy movie and I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but I did even though it's obviously not realistic. Seeing some of the critic and user reviews, I think some people would have preferred if the movie didn't contain the fantasy stuff, but it does make the movie unique and a bit more interesting.",8,0,0,13 April 2020
The Lion King," Good story
","I finally watched this movie today and it was a good animated movie with so much tension and dramatic moments which you never really see in animated movies today. I'm not a fan of musicals, but the songs in the movie were ok, the one with the pig and meerkat was pointless and didn't fit in the story. It was still a good movie which teaches some important lessons which children movies should.",8,0,0,22 April 2019
Inception," Good interesting movie
","The movie was good from the beginning and it has a very intriguing plot along with some good action scenes. I did find it a bit hard to follow sometimes, but I eventually knew what was going on most of the time. You need to be really focus when watching the movie and possibly watch it more than once to understand it fully.",8,0,1,18 May 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Great movie
","I finally watched this movie today and I should have watched it way sooner. This is probably the most interesting movie I have ever seen; It has a very intriguing plot and there isn't any dull moments. You will feel so connected with the characters who were portrayed very well I got to say. Its a disgrace this movie did so badly in the box office. You should definitely watch this movie, even if you're not into drama movies because this a very intriguing movie.",10,0,0,27 March 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Decent
","This is a decent thriller movie about some disturbing types of people. It was a bit slow for me at the beginning, but it started to get interesting after like 30 minutes. The plot was definitely intriguing, but I wish it had a bit more action in it which it should've had in a movie about disturbing killers. The ending could've been better as I was expecting something really vicious and disturbing to happen, I felt the ending was a bit too easy.",7,1,1,29 May 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," Good movie
","I watched The Dark Knight recently which I absolutely loved and this movie was a good one to end the trilogy. The plot was intriguing and I liked how they made the Batman seem weak and unstable which is refreshing from watching other movies that portray the superhero as strong and unstoppable. One downside is that I felt the movie was a bit too long which caused some parts of the movie to be less interesting. The actions scenes were good, I wish there was more, but that's probably the result of making Batman less powerful. Overall, this movie is good, but not quite as good as The Dark Knight in my opinion.",8,0,0,29 March 2019
Black Panther," Decent
","I thought i wasn't going to like the movie because i wasn't too keen on watching an African superhero, but i actually enjoyed the movie.",7,0,3,5 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Just too long
","I watched the ultimate edition which was 3 hours long, and I was so relieved when it finished. The plot was ok, but I barely understood some of it. The movie was just too long and boring for the most part. It got exciting around 1 hour and 50 minutes into the movie, by then I just wanted the movie to end. The action scenes were good, especially Batman's fight scene when he was saving Superman's mum. Superhero movies shouldn't be 3 hours long (unless it's the avengers) and they shouldn't be too dull and complex to follow, otherwise the movie is going to get hate from the audience, which this movie did.",5,3,5,5 August 2019
Speed," Classic 90s action movie
","So i decided to watch this movie because i've recently seen Keanu Reeves John Wick movies and the last movie i watched was Sandra Bullock's Bird Box; both actors did well in the movie. This movie was absolutely fun and intriguing to watch with a good plot and action scenes which were kind of over the top just like in most action movies. Remember that this movie was released in 1994 and it might not have the standard of good action movies of today, but it was great for its time. One downside is that there are a few plot holes or things that don't make sense; but if you just want to watch a classic action movie with good action scenes and a more than half decent plot, i recommend you watch this if you haven't before.",8,1,1,7 January 2019
The Sixth Sense," Good, simple horror movie
","This is a good movie with an very intriguing plot with no dull moments at all. To be honest, I was expecting it to have more scary and thrilling moments, but that's probably because I watched it without knowing much of the plot or seeing a trailer beforehand. It's more of a drama movie rather than a full-blown horror movie; Its like a kids horror movie if that makes sense. Overall, its a very enjoyable movie with some twists which make it better.",8,1,1,17 April 2019
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Boring at the beginning, and not much fighting
","I liked the first Hunger Games movie even though there were a few parts of the movie I didn't like, but I didn't find this sequel good. It was boring from the beginning which made me feel uninterested throughout the whole movie. I also thought that the plot wasn't that great either, especially when they are in the games and there's not much fighting which didn't make sense. The ending felt rushed and didn't make sense, like how the games was the plan for a rebellion; how did they know Katniss was gonna survive, let alone cause the power cut which will lead to a rebellion?",5,0,0,19 August 2019
Heat," Good movie with some thrilling scenes
","This is a good heist movie with a good plot; the movie was a bit too long for me, but I was still intrigued with the story through out. Along with a good plot, there was some some good action scenes, especially the bank scene which was thrilling; wish it had more action scenes. Overall, it's a good movie which is a bit lengthy, but its worth the watch.",8,1,1,8 June 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," First one was better, but this is still good.
","It was an interesting movie, all of the action scenes were good and so was the plot even though i wasn't expecting that type of plot. I found the first movie better and more interesting (which is probably the reason for the mixed reviews), but this one ain't bad i feel.",7,0,2,6 December 2018
Aladdin," It's up there with the best animated movies ever.
","Finally got to watch this movie today and I'm thinking I should've watched this way earlier. The plot was amazing and kept me intrigued throughout with all the interesting plot twists and action. I'm not a big fan of musicals, but I enjoyed most of the songs in the movie, and I didn't feel they were a distraction from the story like in some other animated movies. Overall, the movie is great and probably the best and most fun animated movie ever.",9,1,1,14 June 2019
Incredibles 2," It was good
","I've been waiting 14 years for this sequel and it didn't disappoint. The story and action scenes were fun and intriguing to watch. However, one negative thing about the movie is that i felt like it focused too much on Elastigirl and not enough on the other family members until towards the end of the movie. Overall it was still a pretty decent movie.",7,1,1,30 October 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," What a bs movie
",I just didn't like the movie from the start and wanted to stop watching it immediately. It was just unexplained action from the beginning with no plot at all. I don't know how people can like these types of geeky movies with all the science fiction bs. It would have been decent if it had an actual plot and not just over the top action.,4,14,23,3 May 2019
The Social Network," It's a good movie, not absolutely great like most people say
","I thought the movie was quite decent, not absolutely amazing like most of the people and nearly all the critics say which is quite surprising. The plot was good and kept me intrigued, even though some parts of the movie I found hard understand, I felt the drama in the movie was good. I didn't know about the events that were portrayed in the movie, but it made me dislike Mark Zuckerberg a little bit because I felt sorry and sympathetic to Eduardo. I'm surprised the critics have rated this movie very highly, for me yeah it's a good movie, but not up there with one of the greatest movies I've seen.",7,1,1,4 November 2019
Goodfellas," It was a good film, wish it had more action scenes
","Its a good and interesting drama crime movie. I am a little disappointed that there wasn't more action scenes, especially of the robberies which would've made the movie a bit more interesting. That's probably the reason why the movie did bad in the box office, as it doesn't have much intense and thrilling moments. But still its a decent movie with a good story, just don't expect it to be one of those action-packed crime movies.",7,0,1,1 April 2019
The Proposal," Decent
","It's not one of the worst comedy movies, but it isn't the best either. I felt the first half of the movie was good and I was intrigued with the story; It was the other half that let it down as it just became similar to the other lame rom-com movies. There was a few funny moments in the movie, but also some weird ones like the chanting and the awkward naked interaction, which were not necessary. I thought it was gonna be a unique rom-com, but it ended up being predictable and dull towards the end.",6,0,0,5 June 2019
Dodgeball," Just a funny silly comedy movie
","This is quite a good comedy movie which definitely has some funny moments and an intriguing plot. I did find some parts of the plot stupid and illogical, but I guess that's what you get in silly, goofy comedy movies like this. I am that type of person that likes comedy movies that can be believable, have a realistic plot and not have to much silliness as possible, but I quite enjoyed this movie despite it having all those things.",7,1,1,14 October 2019
Rock Star," What a BS movie
","I decided to watch this only because Jennifer Aniston is in it and i wished i hadn't of watched it at all. The plot wasn't that great and didn't make sense; like how can a wannabe lame rock-star become a big star and join a great band overnight? There were barely any funny moments in this movie, so it shouldn't be considered as a comedy. I'm not a rock fan or listen to rock music at all but i felt this movie didn't portray the life of a rock-star accurately and realistically; probably the reason why it was such a box office bomb. Only good thing is i felt Jennifer Aniston portrayed her character as Emily well like she does in most of her movies.",5,0,3,10 January 2019
