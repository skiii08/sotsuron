Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The most gross movie I have ever seen
","How can a person can demean a nation to such a degree! There can't be worse than this movie. Nobody has the right to humiliate a whole nation like this! Here Mr. Borat, a TV reporter of kazakhstan, comes to America, the greatest of all country. That's all right. But it was highlighted many times that he is from kazakhstan and his character, his family member's activities are shown in a disgusting way. He is kissing everybody, he is kissing his sister who is a prize winner whore who show her birth giving machine to her younger brother!!! Come on!! What is this? It might seem fuuny, but what i think that it might have been funny if country's name was kept anonymous, or at least they could've avoid the family sex. It is just showing outmost contemn to a specific nation. It just do not seem right to me.",1,1,3,19 March 2014
