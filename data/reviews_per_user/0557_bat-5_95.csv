The Blair Witch Project," Things that go bump in the night.
","One of the best things about The Blair Witch Project is the fact that you have to use your imagination.  You are out in the middle of nowhere, and there are noises moving all around you in the dark.  You can't see anything, you only hear things.  And that's what scares you the most.  If it's something you can see, you'll think of a way to deal with it.  If you don't see it, you don't know what to do.  So you become scared.  Fear starts to overwhelm you and clouds your thinking.  That's what this movie does.  You have to use your imagination and put yourself in these kids shoes.  There aren't any monsters to blow up, no ghosts to run away from, no houses to escape from.  Everything around you has turned into something frightening. The Blair Witch Project is a movie that relies on the gradual building of suspense rather than the usual horror movie tricks.  If you scoff, try going camping in an unfamiliar place and see if you can figure out what's going bump in the night.",8,0,0,4 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Spectacular!
","When I first saw The Phantom Menace, I felt like I was four years old again, and seeing Star Wars for the first time.  Some critics and naysayers will pick apart the plot and eventually point out holes, and others will complain about the acting.  But for amazing visuals, great special effects and the beginning story of the Star Wars saga, you can't go wrong.  Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are great in the roles of Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Natalie Portman brings a solid determination to the character of Queen Amidala that is seen in Princess Leia in the current trilogy.  Jake Lloyd is not as bad as some have said he is.  He's a kid, playing a kid.  He enjoys pod racing, which is quite exciting, and he is completely unaware of the fate that awaits him.  The duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and the very sinister Darth Maul outdoes the duels from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi combined.  Watching these three Jedi duel was quite amazing.  The sound and flashes of color as the sabers collied was quite exhilarating.  Even though Darth Maul wasn't in the film much, he makes a lasting impression that.  That's pretty much how Boba Fett's popularity got started.  So, take the kids, skip work, and become a child again, ready to be amazed at the wonders that George Lucas has presented for our viewing pleasure.  The saga begins, again.",9,1,3,19 May 1999
The Sound of Music," Delightful film
","The Sound Of Music is a film that will age well.  Part of its charm is due to Julie Andrews who makes singing in the Alps look like a blast.  The cinematography is beautiful and the sets are remarkable.  The Rodgers and Hammerstein score will stick in your head days after viewing the film. Watch this film and try not to be charmed, you will wind up enjoying it.  I did.",9,1,7,29 May 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," one hell of a ride!
","This film has got to be one of the best films that showcases top notch stunt work and top of the line special effects.  The script has the right bit of humor and action that keeps you moving along with the plot.  Harrison Ford is at his best here, playing the intrepid Indiana Jones.  His goal of course is to find the Ark before the Nazi's do, and we're along for the ride!  The movie seems to climax several times, from the escape from Peru to the burning bar in Nepal.  The street fight, the discovery of the Ark, the fight beneath the flying wing, the desert chase, and of course the opening of the Ark.  In between  all of this action we meet some interesting characters that become the main reason for watching this movie in the first place.  Sure the effects and stunts are neat, but if we don't care about the characters, then they're not that special anymore.",10,1,2,22 October 1998
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Potshots taken at major religions, and it's wonderful!
","Life Of Brian has the most coherent plot of the three Python films.  It also takes major potshots at well established religions by exaggerating all of the teachings in them!  Michael Palin's Pilate is hysterical.  The stoning scene shows the utter absurdity of the act.  A wild ride through space in the middle of the film, an impromptu lesson in grammar from a Centurion and one of the greatest endings of all time make this one of the funniest movies ever made.",Null,1,4,6 February 1999
Se7en," Blew my mind!
","Seven is not your standard serial killer on the loose film.  It is a dark, grimy, visceral thriller that chills you to the bone days, months and years after you've seen it.  The crimes that John Doe perpetrates in this film grow more and more atrocious as the film progresses, and we can't help but watch.  It's a glimpse into ourselves.  We find these events horrible, but at the same time we wonder what could push someone to acts such as these? That's where Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman come in.  They provide the questions that we as an audience are afraid to ask.  They doggedly pursue the killer in an attempt to stop him.  The film ratchets up the tension and only in the final act of the film do we meet John Doe.  Kevin Spacey is absolutely chilling.  So calm, so cold and so damn intelligent.  The ending knocked me out.",Null,1,1,20 January 1999
Fight Club," Bare knuckled brawling at its best.
","David Fincher pulls out all the cinematic tricks in Fight Club. We get long shots that pull out from deep within a character, and I do mean deep and we get reality distorted so much that when reality comes back into focus, it's almost like getting slapped in the face.  It's hard to talk about Fight Club without giving away its surprises.  All I can say is see, it for yourself.  The movie is complex and you'll be thinking about it after you've left the theater.  Brad Pitt is at his best when he plays unhinged characters.  Here, he gets to be unhinged and I think he's perfect in this role.  He gets to be a bad boy and we revel in all of his guerilla tactics.  I liked the trick he does while working at a movie theater.  For all of the violence in Fight Club, there is only one death.  None of the brawlers fight to the death.  They might get beaten to a bloody pulp, but they live to fight another day.  What do you expect from a movie that's called Fight Club?",8,0,1,17 October 1999
Citizen Kane," The birth of modern movie making.
","Citizen Kane is a film that has influenced directors in every country that has a film industry.  Directors that range from Ed Wood to the likes of Kurosawa, Scorsese, Tarantino, etc...use Kane as a blueprint for their own films.  The deep focus cinematography provided by Greg Toland is a precursor to the fluid camera work of Martin Scorsese.  The fragmented story structure can be seen in Kurosawa's Rashomon, and in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  To watch Citizen Kane now, you are witnessing the birth of modern films.  The cinematography, the editing, the fragmented story, the art direction all are precursors to today's films.  Citizen Kane is, in one word, magnificent.",Null,0,0,14 February 1999
Memento," A wholly unique movie going experience.
","Starting with the ending and moving backward, Memento challenges us with its backwards narrative and shows us that things aren't actually what they seem.  Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man without the ability to create new memories.  All he knows is that someone raped and murdered his wife, and he's going to find the man and kill him.  In his quest, he is aided by two characters who may know more than they let on.  Joe Pantoliano's Teddy and Carrie-Anne Moss' Natalie.  Both have reasons for helping Leonard, but we like Leonard, don't really know who to trust.  As the action progresses backwards, we learn more about Leonard and his condition and we learn more about why things happen to Leonard.  To talk about this film would detract from the fun of watching it unfold, (or is it recede?) in front of you.  You think you know what happens, you think you know why Leonard did what he did, but that's only the beginning.  And nothing is what it seems.",9,0,0,5 April 2001
Shakespeare in Love," A good movie, but best picture?
","Shakespeare In Love is a very entertaining film.  The script was witty, and the direction was flawless.  Shakespeare was brought down from that high, high pedastel and made mortal.  He was shown as having everyday problems that constantly plague us.  Throw in a serious case of writer's block and a play that has one really bad title and you can feel Will's pressures. Judi Dench was fun to watch as Queen Elizabeth and Gwenyth Paltrow was enjoyable. The supporting cast was filled with life and the productions values were solid.  The only thing that I don't see is how this film won best picture. This will be one of those head scratching questions that will plauge movie watchers for years to come.",Null,0,0,6 May 1999
12 Monkeys," Complex, and involving story
","12 Monkeys is one of those films that creeps up on you.  It doesn't present its plot right from the beginning, it slowly unfolds in many different layers.  Only after the film is over do you get the full impact.  Full of Terry Gilliam's usual visionary images, the film carries you along from past, present and to the future.  The airport sequence is where everything comes together, and the final scene in slow motion is mesmerizing.  A hard movie to pin down, and explain.  All that can be said is watch the film, and make your own judgments.",8,0,0,3 June 1999
12 Angry Men," Outstanding
","On a hot, summer day in New York, twelve jurors mull over the fate of a young boy on trial.  Eleven jurors vote guilty, but only one votes not guilty.  Through methodical, and meticulous attention to the details, Henry Fonda starts to sway each juror, one by one.  Not many films around that can have an entire movie take place in one room.  Sidney Lumet packs the powder keg and slowly turns up the heat.  You'll find yourself glued to the screen, waiting to see if Henry Fonda can sway the jury.",9,0,1,11 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Vulger, obnoxious, and funny as all get out
","South Park, has always been rude, crude and very juvenile.  But it was always held back by the TV censors.  Now, Parker and Stone have unleashed their fearsome four on the movie going populace.  Laced with enough four letter words and multiple variations of them, it's enough to make a drill seargent blush.  But, amid the tirade of foul language, is a satire that makes us examine our own lives.  Do we want v-chips censoring what we say? Do we want what we see, to be monitored by some sort of legislative body that will decide what's good for the mass populace?  I'm sure that there will be a wave of controversy surrounding this movie.  There's always been something to complain about ever since it premiered two years ago.  The movie is not for kids.  It's rated R and if you do decide to take your kid to see it, be prepared to explain a lot of things to them, and I do mean a lot!  Don't go blaming the movie for their foul language that they might pick up, as our four heroes did, blame the lack of parental control.  As for the film, be prepared to laugh, and laugh at the things that Parker and Stone get away with.  Just don't follow Terence and Philip's example of fun.",7,1,1,1 July 1999
Elizabeth," Most impressive.
","There are scenes in Elizabeth that strike you with the most beautiful imagery that has only been seen before in tapestries.  The coronation scene is absolutely stunning, with those high reaching walls and those massive arches.  Visually, Elizabeth is a triumph of art direction and costuming. The story is quite good too.  Treachery, deceit, and plenty of scheming make for dangerous times in England.  As the young queen, Cate Blanchett runs a full course of emotions.  She is young and naieve, but once she ascends to the throne of England, she is thrust upon the world stage as a ruler of a soon to be great nation.  She must first deal with the machinations of her own court.  She then learns how to deal with her new found title, and she begins to take care of all of her enemies.  The climax of the film reminded me of The Godfather, as one by one, Elizabeth's enemies are dealt with. Geoffrey Rush is scheming and devious as Elizabeth's main protector.  He's cunning, ruthless, and he knows how to play sides.  In the end, even he is floored by the transformation that Elizabeth takes upon herself.  She truly becomes The Virgin Queen.",7,0,0,11 August 1999
The Fifth Element," Outlandishly spectacular
","Watching The Fifth Element is like riding a roller coaster, it's best to hang on and enjoy the ride.  The film is filled with lush, wild visions of the future.  New York is a even more bustling metropolis.  Filled with flying vehicles pack the city skyline so deep, you wonder how anyone manages to fly in that traffic.  Outfits that look like they sprung from a combination of a nightmare and fantasy adorn the denizens of Earth, and various other planets, 250 years in the future.  Bruce Willis plays a cabbie who has the task of saving the world from ultimate evil. Piece of cake compared to driving a cab in New York.  Luc Besson manages to pack every scene with so much detail, it's staggering to watch for the first time.  Sure it's a bit silly, and if you stop and analyze it too much, the film falls apart.  But that's not why he made it.  The Fifth Element is a thrill ride pure and simple.  You have action, fantastic visuals, a really weird sense of humor, (courtesy of Chris Tucker's performance) and an over the top villain.  You'll have your ups and downs but overall, you'll enjoy the ride, and want to go back again.",8,0,1,25 March 2000
The Mummy," Highly entertaining!
","The Mummy was a fun, action adventure romp through ancient Egyptian curses and excitement that hasn't been seen since Indiana Jones.  Brendan Frasier is perfectly cast, as is the lovely Rachel Weisz.  The film has thrills, spills, chases and of course, the mummy.  The visual effects from ILM are amazing.  They bring a fresh spin on a classic story.  The film has a breezy pace that never becomes too heavy, and it has moments of humor and good old fashioned gross out moments.  For an afternoon well spent, go see it. Adventure movies should be fun, exciting, and take you to far off places with larger than life characters, beautiful damsels, and really nasty villains.  The Mummy has it all!",9,0,0,10 May 1999
Chicken Run," Utterly charming.
","Chicken Run is probably the most original, most refreshing and delightful movies this season. Nick Park, the genius behind Wallace & Gromit, tells the story of a group of hens who are bound and determined to escape from Tweedy's Farm.  Led by the ever resourseful, and persevering Ginger, the hens try tunneling, making runs for the gate and just about everything else you could imagine.  When all hope is lost, along comes Rocky Rhodes, who might just be the answer to their prayers.  The film benefits from being animated with clay.  If it was done with traditional animation or computers, the feel of the film would be off.  The chickens with their large behinds and teeth look less like chickens, and more like a strange sort of doppleganger to the actors that give them voices.  A very British sensibility runs through the film.  From Ginger's never give up attitude, to Col. Fowler's tirades about doing things in the R.A.F.  and his feelings towards Rocky's involvement.  As he says about 'Yanks', 'Always late for a war, over sexed and over here.'  Chicken Run is a wonderful film for all ages.  The older kids (namely adults) will have fun with the jokes and references to other films, while the younger kids will enjoy the animation and the rousing story.  Very witty, very charming and utterly irresistable.",9,0,0,9 July 2000
X-Men," Outstanding!
","When I first heard of the plans for a filmed version of The X-Men, I was skeptical.  Many times in the past, comics have been adapted into films.  Some have met with a great degree of success (Superman, Batman) and some have been total disasters (Batman & Robin, Steel).  After seeing X-Men, I can safely say that my fears were unwarrented.  Bryan Singer crafted a superb story that condenses thirty years of backstory into a movie that moves quickly, but gives you enough information on the main characters.  As for the characters, the cast was perfect.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are Professor X and Magneto.  The scenes between these two powerful mutants show their common respect for each other, but also illustraits the differences between them.  Hugh Jackman is perfect as Wolverine.  He's got attitude, he smokes and he's got a mean streak a mile wide.  As in the comic, there is an immediate dislike for Cyclops, and a small degree of attraction to Jean Grey.  Famke Janssen was perfect as the telekinetic doctor and James Marsden was perfectly stiff as the team's stalwart leader.  Halle Barry was a good choice as Storm, and I suspect that we'll see more of this team, hopefully it will be soon.  Facing off against the X-Men is Magneto's team of mutants. Mystique, a vicious shapeshifter, does some neat quick changes.  Toad and Sabretooth round out Magneto's team and these guys are a formidable force for the X-Men.  I think we'll see more of them soon.  So, all of the X-fans can relax.  Our favorite mutant superhero team has made the giant leap from page to screen with outstanding results.  With the overwhelming repsonse the movie has generated, I hope and pray that there will be a sequel.  It would be interesting to see where Professor X and his gifted students lead us",9,0,0,16 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Visually stunning
","Tim Burton has weaved a nightmarish film out of the old Sleepy Hollow tale. Dead trees reaching toward a eternally grey sky.  A fog that hangs around the town like a shroud, and a population that keeps their secrets.   Into this macarbe atmosphere comes Ichabod Crane, dispatched from New York to find out who is behind the slayings of three towns people. Ichabod thinks the murders to be committed by a human, but he soon learns otherwise when the Horseman comes.  The Headless Horseman is a nightmare vision himself. Dressed in dark clothes and riding a horse of the same color, he charges at his victims with lightning speed and with one well placed cut: off comes their heads!   Burton keeps the gore to a minimum, but raises the intensity level of the film so that your heart will quicken.  Of course, a Tim Burton film isn't complete without a Danny Elfman score and we get a fast, furious and ethereal score to compliment the images on screen.  Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Ichabod, and Christina Ricci is the ray of light in this gloomy little town.   Heads do roll in this film.  Beware.",8,0,0,20 November 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," one of the funniest black comedies ever
","Dr. Strangelove, the name alone makes you giggle.  Stanley Kubrick's cold war satire is still one of the best black comedies ever made.  The movie basically states that all military officials are nuts.  You've got Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper who is obsessed with bodily fluids.  George C. Scott as gung ho Buck Turgidson.  Slim Pickens as bomb riding Major Kong and Peter Sellars as Mandrake, the President, and of course Dr. Strangelove, whose right hand still holds allegiance to the Third Reich.  Best thing to do is get a hold of the Criterion laserdisc and watch the film, then watch the actual films that were produced by the U.S. government about what to do in the event of a nuclear war.  They are just as funny as the film, plus they were serious!",Null,2,4,6 January 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A fitting end to a great saga
","Jedi is considered by hard core fans to be the weak link.  I don't think so. It's exciting, it's never dull and it neatly takes care of all the loose ends that Empire gave us.  The movie starts off by showing the new Death Star and a very serious Darth Vader.  Then it's off to Tattooine where Luke and company escape from Jabba the Hutt in a great light saber/blaster shoot out.  Yoda confirms Luke's fears and Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must confront Darth Vader.  The speeder bike chase, the blooming relationship between Han and Leia and that forest battle!  Wow!  But the main crux of the film is between Luke and Vader, and The Emperor.  The duel between Luke and Vader is spectacular, and when Luke loses it after Vader goads him into it is just amazing.  In defeating Vader, Luke stands to become him.  Vader turning on his Emperor is outstanding.  The force theme swells on the soundtrack and the Emperor is tossed down to the bowls of the Death Star. Quite a comeback for someone who was pure evil in the last two films.  Throw in one hell of a space battle and you've got yourself a film that will entertain you and blow your socks off.",Null,0,0,30 October 1998
Taxi Driver," remarkable
","Taxi Driver starts out slow, as we follow Travis Bickle around New York in his daily routine.  We can identify with him, he's a little shy, awkward around strangers.  Then we see that he's very detached mentally as well as socially.  He learns more about Betsy by a very simple form of stalking.  He means no harm, but in his attempts to impress her, he only succeeds in driving her away.  After the disaster with Bestsy and the chance encounter with the Senator she works for, Travis suddenly has a purpose in his life. The film starts to move quicker as Travis prepares for his mission.  He becomes more and more removed from society.  His face reflects a simple minded goal.  His attempt at assassination goes bad and Travis decides he must save Iris, the 13 year old prostitute he met.  The film becomes a bloodbath as Travis shoots everyone he sees in a sleazy hotel.  Scorsese's view of New York is a gritty, violent one.  DeNiro perfectly captures the malaise that many people feel in large cities.  Most people are not like Travis Bickle, but there are some who are just like him.  Ticking time bombs, waiting to go off.  Travis went off, and in the end of the film we see in his eyes that he's not done going off.",Null,0,0,29 October 1998
Barry Lyndon," A painting come to life.
","Barry Lyndon has the look and feel of an 18th century painting that has started to move.  Each shot is planned out and staged much like the inhabitants of those very paintings.  The costumes and sets are remarkable. Kubrick's direction of his actors helps you see what life might have been like in this time.  Very proper, very repressed.  Even the duel between Barry and his stepson is tense.  The way Kubrick paced this film is never tiresome.  There is always something to look at in that frame.  This film wouldn't be a true Kubrick film without an ironic sense of humor, which is summed up in the epilouge.  'All are equal now.'",Null,1,1,19 May 1999
Full Metal Jacket," The Best of the Vietnam movies.
","Full Metal Jacket is the best of the string of Vietnam films that came out in the late '80's.  Kubrick's war film follows a group of recruits from boot to bush, and for the most part it's pretty real.  The boot camp scenes are as close you'll ever get apart from joining the Marines.  Part of this is thanks in part to R. Lee Ermey's portrayal of a hard ass drill sargent.  He is loud, vulgar, and very angry.  Kubrick puts you into the shoes of a recruit and lets Ermey shout and berate you.  A friend of mine went into the Marines a while back.  I asked him about boot and Full Metal Jacket.  He said it was exactly like the movie.  Credit Stanley Kubrick for making a film that pulls no punches with what it's like to live the life of a Marine Corps recruit.",Null,0,0,1 March 1999
The Grapes of Wrath," American classic
","The Grapes of Wrath gives us the hardships and prejudices that 'Okies' had to face during their journey to California.  Forced off their land, and striking out west, the Joad family encounters just about every kind of hardship, yet the family lives on.  Mostly in part of Ma Joad, who keeps her family going through the worst of times.  Henry Fonda is wonderful as Tom. You can see his anger and frustration behind his eyes.  There's so much injustice going on around him, and he's powerless against it.  When he's about ready to do something foolish, it's his mother that pulls him back and makes him think about what his actions will do.  Unfortunately for Tom, fate has a way of dealing a bad hand and he must leave his family, not for his safety, but for theirs.  John Ford, a man usually associated with the western genre, brings Steinbeck's epic to the screen with skill and care. He invests so much time with the Joads that you feel like they're your own family.  And it pains you to see them go through such pain.  There is an uplifting end to it.  Ma Joad tells her husband that they will live on, they are the good people and nothing will ever wipe them out.",9,1,3,14 August 1999
Glory," Outstanding!
","One of the first memories I have of Glory is the opening battle.  The Union soldiers march slowly toward the Confederates.  As they get closer, cannon fire rains down on them.  Men go flying through the air and dust and smoke start to cloud the sky.  Artillery rounds rip through the air and scatter the ranks.  As the soldiers get closer, the Confederates open fire with their rifles and more fall.  Soon the entire field is in chaos as men look for cover and begin to retreat.  Matthew Broderick displays stoic bravery under this hellacious fire.  A cannon round explodes and blows apart the officer's head that was standing in front of him.  Men crawl away, with limbs missing and the field is littered with bodies.Never before has the Civil War been shown so realisticly.  The costumes, the weapons, and the way armies fought are accurate.  The performances are first rate too.  Matthew Broderick, Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington shine. Equal credit goes to Andre Braugher and Cary Elwes.  The final assault the 54 takes on is at the same time remarkable and sad.  They are marching into a slaughterhouse, and they know it.Glory is a film of strong performances, great cinematography, bloody battles, and a fine story of men who fought for freedom.",9,0,0,14 May 1999
American Pie," Very entertaining
","American Pie transports us all back to the much easier time of high school when all we had to worry about was getting a date for the prom, your finals and what to do after high school.  What sets this film apart from the other high school films that came out this year is the amount of time invested in the characters, especially the female characters.  The four male characters seem to think they have it all figured out, much like most of his thought we did in high school.  What we learn, as these guys do, is that life is not that simple.  We watch them make their mistakes and laugh at them because we've all done the same things.  We say the wrong things, make the wrong choices, but it helps us grow.  In the course of this film, the four characters grow as people.  Jim learns of what it feels like to be used, Oz transcends the role of typical jock and becomes something better.  Kevin learns that there is more to a relationship than sex, and Finch, well Finch appreciates the finer things in life.  The only one who really doesn't grow is Stiffler, only because he provides the role of jerk, and he does it well. The female characters are all smart, and they are more than pretty faces. Like their male counterparts, they think they have things figured out, and for the most part, they do.  The one who really stands out is band geek Michelle, played with scene stealing gusto by Alyson Hannigan.  All of her conversations start out with 'At band camp...' and continue on from there. But, she's a lot smarter than she lets on and in a great scene we see just how clever this girl really is.  I knew I was going to enjoy American Pie, I didn't realize that I would enjoy it as much as I did.",9,0,0,10 July 1999
Cast Away," One of the best films of the year.
","Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis take you on a journey that you'll not soon forget.  When we first meet Hanks' character, he's a time obsessed FedEx employee who lives by the clock.  His entire life has to be scheduled at least a week in advance.  Then, one fateful evening he departs on a plane that crashes into the Pacific.  After surviving the crash, Chuck is washed ashore on an island in the middle of nowhere.  Now, he has nothing but time on his hands.  Slowly but surely, Chuck begins to reawaken primal insticnts that have layed dormant in him, and through this, we see just how resourseful, and resiliant humans can be.  To their credit, Zemeckis and Hanks never resort to anything that would be found on Gilligan's Island.  No pirates, no apes, no nothing in fact.  All that is on island is Hanks, and whatever has washed ashore.  Since humans are a social animal, the need for communication is essential, and one of the best relationships developed in the film is between Chuck and Wilson.  Through Wilson, Chuck is able to express his concerns, his fears, his hopes and this allows him a shred of sanity.  Once again, Robert Zemeckis shows hi s mastery at the art of storytelling. He makes good use of the visual effects to propel the story forward, and the effects never take center stage.  Even during the very realistic plane crash.  The effects are there to help the story, they are not the story.  Tom Hanks shows that he's one of the best actors working today.  His weight loss for the film has been duly noted in many papers and periodicals but to see him go from a thick, bear like man to a skeletal frame with a scraggly beard is quite shock.  He gives his all for his performance, and there are scenes on and off the island that contain only Hanks, and these scenes are heartbreaking.  Some may complain that the running time is too long, that the film starts to slow down once Hanks is on the island.  Well, that's the point.  We begin to feel what he's going through. With nothing but time on your hands, and no way to measure it, time seems to stand still.  
Cast Away is one of the better films this season, and one  of the best films of the year.  Thanks in part to the performance of Tom Hanks and the masterful direction of Robert Zemeckis.",Null,0,0,13 January 2001
The Thing," Good movie to watch on a cold, dark night.
","The Thing will scare you.  John Carpenter's film starts off slowly, then he lets things loose when the alien erupts from the dog.

The creature is hideous and will give you the creeps.  One of Carpenter's best.",8,0,1,2 March 1999
Armageddon," Super silly, and super fun rollercoaster ride.
","Armageddon is just a movie that you sit back and let it take you for a spin around on a giant asteroid.  Sure some say it's silly, loud, and at times totally preposterous.  But, it's also a lot of fun.  Just a good, action adventure film to watch after dealing with eight hours of the real world.",Null,1,1,3 June 1999
Pitch Black," Good, but not great.
","Pitch Black benefits from having Vin Diesel in the main role as the anti-hero Richter.  He's smart, he's witty and he could be the next big action hero.  Pitch Black has some nice touches. The bleached out look that the planet has is an interesting touch, not one you usually see in science fiction films.  The creatures are interesting, and I like the idea that they only exist in total darkness.  Rahda Mitchell is gutsy and resourseful as Fry, and as I said before, Diesel is primed to be the next big action hero.  Pitch Black borrows from earlier films, most notably Alien, but it doesn't improve on the formula.  It's a good movie to go see if you want something to do for a few hours.  It doesn't really scare you, but it also doesn't bore you.",6,0,0,2 March 2000
North by Northwest," Wonderful.
","There are certain films in existance that you can watch over and over and they will always remain fresh and vibrant as the day they were released.  North By Northwest is one such film. Filled with the usual Hitchcock themes, the movie begins innocently enough when Roger Thornhill calls for a bell boy calling for a George Caplan.  From there, he's whisked into a world of murder, espionage, smuggling and late night romances aboard trains.  The suspense and plot build together as we, along with Thornhill, try to figure out what's happening, and try not to get killed along the way.  Among the films highlights is the infamous crop duster sequence, in which Hitchcock shows you that even in the middle of nowhere, there is still danger. Cary Grant is perfectly cast as the rather quick witted Roger O. Thornhill. Eva Marie Saint is the prerequisite blonde Eve Kendall who helps Thornhill in his quest.  The always wonderful James Mason is oily and sinister as Phillip Vandamm,  and Martin Landau hides a hidden menace behind his slightly crooked grin. Throw in a wonderful score from Bernard Herrmann, a top notch script from Ernest Lehman and masterful direction from Alfred Hitchcock, and you have a movie that you can never grow tired of.   Plus, you have to love that last shot.",10,0,0,5 April 2001
Doctor Zhivago," Epic lovestory
","Only David Lean could take a love story and set it against the backdrop of the Russian Revolution.  Zhivago and Lara, destined to be pulled apart by forces beyond their control are the centerpoint of this grand, sweeping film.  Amazing cinematography and a wonderful score from Maurice Jarre give this film a quality that has endured for nearly forty years.  Like Lawrence of Arabia, this film needs to be seen in a large theater to fully appreciate those beautiful mountains, snow fields and crowd scenes.",8,1,2,22 July 1999
U-571," A great submarine adventure
","U-571 gives us the chance to feel what it was like to serve on a submarine during WWII.  Playing a very dangerous game of cat and mouse, subs would sneak up on an unsuspecting ship and torpedo them out of the water.  But, the subs would have to be careful not to be detected, because any surviving ship would find them, and sink them.  U-571 sets up the plot very quickly, a Nazi U-boat is disabled, and an American sub has a chance to capture the Enigma device.  With the Enigma device in hand, the Allied forces would be able to break the U-boat's codes.   However, things don't go well for the American sailors who commandeer U-571.  They have to evade the Germans in order to make it back to safe waters, and the submarine is not in the best shape. The cast works well, and you can see the tension in their faces when depth charges start rocking the ship.  The film works well on several other levels, especially when there is no sound.  The lack of noise brings out the most tension during the film.  You wait in anticipation for a charge to go off, and you never know when one might.  Be sure to see the film in a theater that has digital sound.  This way, you'll hear every pop, ping, creak and the whine of a torpedo the way you might hear it on a submarine.",7,1,3,25 April 2000
The Shining," creepy as hell!
","If you watch The Shining in a large, darkened house, you will be scared after the movie has run its course.  Kubrick's roving camera gives you the feeling that the Overlook Hotel is watching young Danny ride his big wheel through its large spacious halls.  Jack Nicholson goes deliciously over the top as the unfortunate soul who slowly loses his mind in the Overlook. After watching the movie, be sure to turn on all the lights.  On second thought, better keep them off.  You might run into the twins, and they may invite you to play.",Null,0,0,6 January 1999
American Beauty," One of the best films of the year.
","Watching American Pie is almost like holding a mirror up toourselves and we get to see the ups and downs that happen to usin our daily routines.  Kevin Spacey is perfect as Lester, ahenpecked husband and father who is unappreciated by his familyand his job.  Only when he sees Angela, does his world change. He is born again and he starts living life to its fullest. Annette Benning teeters on the brink of insanity.  She is soobsessed with success, she doesn't realize how pathetic andtrivial her life is.  Only when she has an affair, does shestart to turn around.  Thora Birch and Mena Suvari play theirparts well, and they act like real teenagers.  There are putdowns, boasts and sullen looks that make you feel like you'vebeen transported back to high school.  All of these elementscombine to make a very well directed and well written film.  Wesee the desperation in each persons life and we can identifywith them.  We want to be successful, we want to be loved and wewant to be able to stand out from the rest of the world. Trouble is, this world is a big, bad place and we often get putinto positions that take us further away from our dreams. American Beauty shows us what happens when we take charge of ourlives, and as we see in Kevin Spacey, we can live life to thefullest.  Take time out to see the little things in life, andsee beauty in everything in this world.  If we don't, we mightas well keep our heads bowed and let our dreams be nothing morethan dreams.",9,0,0,29 September 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Still impressive
","Not only does James Cameron make a successful sequel, he manages to outdo the original and push the envelope of visual effects one step further.  Giving us two Terminators for the price of one, Cameron has sent Arnold on a new mission.  This time around, he's out to save the future, and his nemesis is the ever changing, very lethal, T-1000.  The action is fast and furious and each sequence gets larger and more elaborate than the first one.  Cars, trucks, motorcycles and every other type of vehicle you can think of get tossed through the air, blown up and shot up. But at the heart of all this visual mayhem, is a story that deals with relationships.  There's the relationship between John Connor and the Terminator, and how the Terminator starts to grow into a surrogate father.  Then there's the relationship between John and his mother, Sarah, and that's where the real heart of the film is.  Sarah cares for her son, but for the wrong reasons.  She knows what the future holds and she protects him from everything.  In doing so, Sarah has shut herself out of John's life and alienated herself from the rest of humanity.  But when you know how and when the world will end, you'll look at things differently.  The film has not diminished with time.  It's well made and the effects are still amazing. I especially like the scene where the T-1000 comes rising out of a checkerboard floor.  I remember hearing people gasp in awe when that was on.  What I will always remember from T2, is the thrill of seeing it for the first time, and when that metal foot comes down crushing that skull, I can still see the entire theater jumping in unison.  Terminator 2 raised the action and special effects bar to new levels, and only just recently, has that been surpassed.",8,0,0,4 April 2000
Apocalypse Now," The insanity of war.
","As you watch Apocalypse Now, you catch a glimpse of the true nature of war, and the darkness of the human soul.  Captain Willard is ordered to kill Colonel Kurtz, because he's gone insane and fighting the war his way.  As Willard ventures up the river, we get closer and closer to the insanity of war.  Colonel Kilgore attacks a village with The Ride of the Valkyries in the name of surfing.   A Playmate review is dropped into the middle of nowhere and sex starved soldiers go crazy.  A routine boat inspection turns into a nightmare and the Do Long Bridge shows the futility of protecting something that looks good on paper.  Once Willard arrives at Kurtz's compound, we begin to question what we've been told.  Is Kurtz insane, or is it the other way around?  Perhaps Kurtz is the only one thinking clearly.  We've seen things that do not fit into what we would think in a war.  A war brings out the insanity in the human soul.  The one pure action throughout this insanity is the sacrifice of the caribou.  Cut together with the termination of Kurtz, we see the meaning of Kurtz's words.   Apocalypse Now is not an easy film to comment on.  It takes time to examine, dissect, and reconstruct the film in order to come to a conclusion on what the film means to each viewer.   A great film from Francis Ford Coppola that keeps getting better, and more challenging with each passing year.",9,0,0,9 January 2000
The Patriot," A stirring epic
","Never before has the American Revoloution been dramatized so well.  British forces engage the American forces in battles so vivid, you'd swear you were there.  But the battles aren't the only reason to watch this epic, Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances, and that's reason enough to go.  Gibson's Benjamin Martin is a veteran of the French-Indian Wars and he knows what warfare will bring.  After an incident that occurs at the hands of Col. Travington (wonderfully played by Jason Issacs) Martin resurrects a side of himself that he hoped he could escape.  Muskets flash and tomahawks soar through the air as Martin tears his way through British forces. The film has everything you could ask for in a historical epic.  A good attention to period detail, rousing action, wonderful cinematography and larger than life characters that pull you into the story and push all the right emotional buttons.  See it, and be moved.",8,1,2,2 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," Very unique and very funny.
","Being John Malkovich allows Spike Jonze to demonstrate hisconsiderable cinematic powers outside the realm of music videosand commercials.  Working with a superb script and a wonderfullyeclectic cast, Jonze has made a film that is funny, inventiveand completely unique.  A secret tunnel allows John Cusackaccess to John Malkovich's head and from there, the film takesoff.  In order to fully appreciate this film, you have to seeit.  A truly original film that can never be copied.",8,1,2,7 November 1999
54," Watch Boogie Nights instead
","54 is an example of what happens when a studio messes around too much with a movie.  54 could've been good.  There was a good cast involved, but the film was re-edited against the director's wishes and what we got was, well I just don't know.  Ryan Phillipe's character was one of the many 'I just want to get out of here' characters that populate many of today's films.  Salma Hayek seemed woefully wasted, and her character's story line seemed to go nowhere.  Neve Campbell's character was totally useless and added nothing to the dramatic narrative.  Mike Myers was the only good thing about 54.  It's a shame that there was too much messing around on the studio's part.  This could've shown what the nightlife in 54 was like, instead we get just a tiny glimpse.",Null,0,1,3 February 1999
Aliens," outdoes the original!
","You would think that outdoing Alien is an almost impossible task.  James Cameron did it with Aliens.  Instead of copying the first one note for note, like many sequels do, Cameron upped the ante.  There are more characters, more aliens and more heart stopping thrills than you can shake a stick at. Where the film allows you to breathe, it continues to ratchet up the tension.  When the film explodes into action, it is orgasmic.  The release of the tension propels the action forward and we want Ripley, Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez, et al to escape from these hideous beasts that seem to come out of every nook and cranny in this hellacious planet.  Cameron outdoes the climax of Alien by first giving us a glimpse at the queen, and then giving us one hell of a battle between Ripley and the creature that has haunted her for 56 years.  All in all, Aliens is a film that provides action, terror and humor into one package that you cannot tear your eyes from.",Null,0,0,6 January 1999
The Exorcist," a film that is truly frightening
","The Exorcist is a film that works on many levels.  It has scared audiences for 25 years and they still come back for more.  Nowadays we have films that give us a good jump, but The Exorcist has something that those films don't have, a true sense of dread.  The film has its moments of 'boo!'  The vomit shot or the head turning, but what you really remember from the film is the sound and the imagery.  Early in the film when Father Merrin visits a temple in Iraq, he confronts the statue of a demon.  Below him are dogs fighting, as he stares into the statue the dogs sounds become distorted and grotesque. They don't sound like dogs anymore.  The voice of the Devil haunts you for days after viewing the film.  So full of malice and vulgarities, it would be comical if deep in your mind you could separate the voice from the face. Put them together, and you'll still be making sure your windows and doors are locked tightly.  The final thing that follows you around is the ghost white face that appears in Father Karras' dream and in the exorcism of the Devil from Regan.  It only appears for a second, but that face lingers with you. It is not grotesque, but it is evil.  And it will haunt you, just watch the exorcism scene.  Karras looks the Devil in the eye, and you can see his face over Regan's.  It is not a face you will soon forget.",Null,1,1,20 October 1998
American History X," Edward Norton is amazing
","As you watch Ed Norton in the role that garnered him a nomination for best actor, you realize that you are watching acting of a caliber that hasn't been seen since the glory days of Marlon Brando and the early works of Robert DeNiro.  Norton virtually vanishes into this role.  He is scary.  With the shaved head, bulked up physique and tattoos dotted across his torso, he comes across as truly menacing.  The real strength in this role comes from Norton's convictions.  When he rallies his fellow white supremacists into a raid on a grocery store, you believe him.  Then when he returns from prison, you see a totally different person.  You see the pain and sorrow that has cost him three years of his life.   When Norton looks into the mirror and sees the giant swastika emblazened on his chest, you see in his eyes a look of regret.   Edward Furlong is also good in the role of the younger brother who is headed on the same path of destruction that his older brother was on.   All the performances in this film are top notch. The film is hard to watch at times.  The violence and the hate mongering that Norton perpetrates is tough to stomach, but in the end, Norton's character is redeemed.  He has seen the error of his ways and he hopes to keep his brother out of the life that took so much from him and his family.",8,0,0,30 January 2000
Pearl Harbor," Impressive
","Michael Bay's films always split people into two categories.  They either like them, or hate them.  One thing both parties can agree on is the fact that his films move.  There is always a pan, a dolly, a zoom or some other camera trick that takes you farther than other films would.  With Pearl Harbor, Bay takes you back to Dec. 7, 1941 and puts you there as the Japanese begin there attack.  What leads up to the attack however, is a somewhat cliched first hour.  We are introduced to Danny and Rafe, two Tennessee fly boys who have designs on the same nurse.  We also are introduced to various other characters that enter into the grand scheme of things.  Through this hour, we learn who they are, what they want from their lives and begin to make a connection with them.  All of this may have been taken care in a little less time, but it's there on the screen, and like it or love it, it's not going anywhere.  Once the attack on Pearl Harbor begins, the first hour fades into the background and you are thrust into the confusion, the horror and the insanity of the early morning attack.  Planes dive in, strafing ships and people. Bombs scream through the sky and explode on their targets as the smoke gets thicker with each passing second. You witness the death of the Arizona, you watch as Dorie Miller mans a machine gun and opens fire on the attacking planes.  You get caught up in the moment and you feel charged as the American forces retalliate against the Japanese.  You then feel the pain and anguish as the wounded pour into the hospital and you see the fear in the faces of the nurses and doctors as they struggle to save their patients. True there may be some historical inaccuracies, and some facts may have been left out or combined into others.  Overall, Pearl Harbor achieves what it's makers set out to do. They wanted to capture the essense of what it was like to be there on that day.  In that regard, they have succeeded.",7,0,1,3 June 2001
Independence Day," Highly entertaining!
","ID4 is one fun movie to watch.  Impressive special effects help propel the plot and those ships are something!  Part of the fun is watching Will Smith. He brings a touch of bravado that makes you laugh and root for him.  Jeff Goldblum seems to have a knack for playing smarter than average guys, and he makes them falliable.  Bll Pullman puts in a good performance as the president who has to deal with an invasion from outer space.  Highly patriotic with an American slant, considering it was directed by a German and the stirring music was composed by an Englishman.",8,2,6,3 July 1999
Gone with the Wind," An epic soap opera.
","Probably no other film in history will be as popular, or as melodramatic as Gone With The Wind. It's got everything that you could want in a soap opera.  Lavish costumes, magnificent sets, a vicious love triangle and characters that are larger than life.  Of course, with the characters, David O. Selznick scored big time.  Vivian Leigh radiates confidence and sexuality as Scarlett O'Hara.  Clark Gable is cool and charming as Rhett Butler.  Oliva DeHaviland, as Melanie, is the perfect embodiment of a Southern woman.  Set against the backdrop of the Civil War, the movie spans so much time and does it so well, you'll wonder what's happened to the previous three and half hours.  For its' time, Gone With The Wind was a major milestone in movie making.  The burning of Atlanta scene holds up pretty well, along with the massive crane shot that shows the thousands of soldiers laying on the ground.  The score can never be topped. Max Steiner struck gold with the sweeping 'Tara's Theme' and every time you hear it, you can't help but think about Scarlett and the troubles she endures in  her life.  Sure, some may say that the film amounts to about four hours of cheese, but it's got style to spare.",8,1,3,7 March 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Best film of 1998
","Saving Private Ryan is the best film of 1998.  Why?  It is the most accurate description that anyone living today will ever see of World War II combat. It is visceral, it is gut wrenching and it was real.  What we are exposed to in Saving Private Ryan was a meat grinder, and that's what the soldiers on Omaha Beach faced that day.  Spielberg throws us into the melee and we are there, we get to feel the dread as the boats come ashore.  We hear the pounding bass of mortar rounds as they roar in from above, and we feel the fear that the soldiers feel.  We don't know what's waiting for us on that beach, and when those doors open, we step into hell.The camera work during this sequence is amazing.  You are disoriented, and you don't know where the fire is coming from.  You try to make it to cover as machine gun bullets tear into the beach and your fellow soldiers.  Mortar rounds deafen you as they explode a few feet away, and you watch in a numb horror as you see friends vanish before your eyes.  That's what war is, pure and simple.  No time for thoughts on what the nature of God is or any of that metaphysical junk, you're just thinking am I going to live?Saving Private Ryan lets us see what it was like to be a soldier in WWII. We get to know each of the soldiers under Tom Hanks' command.  We feel the loss of their lives because Spielberg invests time with these men.  We feel their anger and resentment toward Ryan.  Why is he so special?  Why does he get the ticket home and we get to stay here?  The more time we spend with these men, the more we know them.  When they finally find Ryan, our view of him changes.  He's not just some punk that the top brass sent us out to find, he's a soldier.  He's one of us, and we'll do everything in our power to get him out alive.You want a meditation on the nature of war and man and what God is?  Watch The Thin Red Line and have your butt numbed.  You want an experience that will linger with you for days?  Watch Saving Private Ryan, then ask your grandparents about WWII.  See what they say.",9,0,0,2 February 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," One of the greatest films ever made.
","As films go, this one is by far one of the best ever made.  I'm always blown away by the first entrance into the desert.  As the sun rises and as the score reaches a crescendo, the scene dissolves into a vast rolling sea of sand.  Cresting the immense dune is Lawrence and his guide, dwarfed by the desert that surrounds them.  The film goes on and continues to impress.  The raid on Aquaba, the score and the performances from Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn are fresh and vibrant now as they were almost forty years ago.  This is one film that needs to be seen in a large theatre, or if one is not available, the letterboxed edition.  If you watch it in a Pan and Scan version, you will be cheating yourself from some of the best cinematography that you will ever see.",10,1,4,18 September 1998
Amadeus," Great performances, and great music.
","I had the fortune of watching Amadeus for the first time on laserdisc a few years ago.  After that viewing, I fell in love with that movie.  The costumes, the art direction, and the music!  F. Murray Abraham is perfect as the tortured Salieri, a mediocre composer that plots and schemes against the loutish, but incredibly gifted, Mozart.  Tom Hulce gives Mozart a boyish charm, and that laugh!  That high pitched giggle that haunts Salieri till the very end.  The music of Mozart is heard constantly through out the film. You can see the foreshadowing and hear it, whenever Mozart's father appears. And when the Don Giovanni piece appears, it all makes sense.  The best scene in the film is when Mozart is ill, and Salieri sees this as his chance to get even with God.  Mozart hears the music that will eventually become the Requiem, all in his head.  As he dictates the score, Salieri becomes overwhelmed by the genius of Mozart.  But, the ultimate indignation for this great composer comes at the end.  The Lacrymosa is playing and we see Mozart's final resting place.  A mass, unmarked grave.  All dramacticaly punctuated by a massive choir, and you feel just like the priest that is taking Salieri's confession.  A great film that showcases music by one of the greatest composers ever to live.",10,2,4,26 June 1999
Ghostbusters," Very funny
","Ghostbusters is one of those films that you can watch again and again and always find something new to laugh at.  The relationship between Venkman, Stantz and Spengler is great.  The one liners that they throw out are worth remembering.  Rick Moranis is exceptionally funny, playing the really odd neighbor Louis. He later becomes possesed by a demon and calls himself Vinz Glortho.  His explanation of things to come is also extremely funny, made even better because he believes it.  The visual effects still hold up and the climax of the film still gives me a good laugh.

Coyote Ugly," It's Flashdance meets Cocktail
","Seems Jerry Bruckheimer is running out of ideas these days.  He's now recycling material from nearly twenty years ago.  With Coyote Ugly, we have the story of a young New Jersey girl moving from NJ to the big bad city of Manhattan.  There, she learns that life in the city is tough and the only way to write music is up on the top of your roof.  Violet, played by Piper Perabo, does have some moments where she has some true defining moments as a character, but those are few and far between.  She finds the titular bar and promptly begins work there with the other barmaids.  They jump, they dance, the light the place on fire all to the tune of heavy pounding rock music.  The one bright spot about this movie is John Goodman.  As Violet's father, he brings some humor and life into an otherwise dull story that has all the plot twists of an unwound pretzel.  And as for Tyra Banks, I don't know why she was cast.  Her character vanishes before the first act is even over.  Lets just hope Bruckheimer doesn't mix any other films together.",5,1,1,20 August 2000
Caddyshack," Best movie about golf ever made.
","When you watch Caddyshack, you think to yourself that this is rather lowbrow.  Then you disregard that part of your brain and settle down for some lowbrow fun. Chevy Chase has top billing, and he's very good.  He's very calm, very funny, and quick witted. But the ones who nearly steal the show are Ted Knight and Bill Murray.  Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield play off each other nicely.  Knight gets flustered and starts stammering, and you can see every vein on his neck!  Dangerfield counters with a crack at Knight's expense and it gets better from there.  Bill Murray is great as Carl, the groundskeeper with a vendetta against that gopher.  He mumbles things to himself, watches old ladies play golf and develops his own grass that can be smoked after playing golf on it.

Mission: Impossible II," Intrigue and action combined
","Mission: Impossible 2 delivers on all fronts.  It has exotic locales, a beautiful woman, a really nasty villain, good butt kicking action and Tom Cruise gliding effortlessly through it all.  The plot centers around a disease called Chimera, something really nasty that many would pay dearly to get their hands on it.  With a neat opening sequence, the plot is off and running.  From there, we catch up with Ethan Hunt, dangling off of a cliff.  He gets his orders and we're off on a thrill ride that only John Woo can deliver.  The first part of the movie gives us espionage, treachery, suspense and a taste of what's to come in the second half.  Woo gives us his trademark action sequences where laws of physics take a back seat to his dazzling displays of bullets and bodies flying through space, and there are many scenes of this caliber that are just too visual to describe.  There are enough explosions, car crashes and fights to satisfy any fan of a good action film.  Your mission, seek out M:I-2 and see Woo and Cruise work their magic.",8,0,2,26 May 2000

Poole and Bowman were at the mercy of HAL.  In this day and age, we are pretty much at the mercy of computers.  What will happen when computers start to think for themselves?

This Is Spinal Tap," The best film about the loudest rock band!

Thrill as you listen to such Tap classics as Big Bottom, Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You (Tonight), Sex Farm, and Rock & Roll Creation.  Gasp as you learn of the terrible realization that Spinal Tap's cover to Smell The Glove is deemed offensive and sexist.  Try not to laugh as the band is hopelessly lost under a stage in Cleaveland shouting 'rock and roll!!'  A wonderfully original film that has been copied many times over, but never matched.

Continuing on with the basic premise that I believe,(toys coming to life when we're not looking) we get an even bigger adventure that goes beyond the next door neighbor's yard.  Woody gets kidnapped and it's up to Buzz, Slinky Dog, Rex, Mr. Potatohead, and Ham to get him back.   We also get a glimpse of what a toy must feel like when they're discarded and no longer played with. Sitting up on shelf for viewing only is a pretty lonely existence for a toy.   I can't say any more or that would spoil the fun of this great movie.  Grab the family and rush out to see this one.  A great adventure for all",9,0,1,27 November 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Disturbing
","A Clockwork Orange is one of the most disturbing, yet interesting pieces of film ever to come out of the mind of Stanley Kubrick.  Here he shows us a society that is overrun with street punks, and they pretty much rule the night.  As we go along with Alex and his Droogs on their nightly missions that include rape, gang fights, home invasion and car stealing we are repelled by the violence and horror that these men cause, but at the same time we are pulled in by the charm that Alex seems to generate.  When he is caught and sent to prison, we sympathize with him.  Then when his free will is taken away, we sympathize with him even more.  Very strange considering this was a man who liked rape and violence.  Kubrick's main theme in the movie is free will.  Once free will is taken away, you are no longer a man. When Alex regains his free will at the end, we revel in his victory.  What an image to show the return of Alex's free will.  Him and a naked woman writhing around in a tub while people dressed in early 19th century clap and the end of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony plays.  If nothing else, Kubrick sure knows how to pick images.",Null,0,0,3 February 1999
Reservoir Dogs," shocking
","With Reservoir Dogs Quetin Tarantino shocked the film going audience awake with a film that showed a flair for crackling dialogue and blistering violence.  A group of criminals get together to do a heist and it all goes sour.  The dialogue is foul and fast.  The film does not let up, the violence pulls you in.  It repulses you and yet you can not look away.  The films most effective sequence is when Mr. Blonde cuts off the ear of a captive cop.  Instead of seeing the bloody scene, Tarantino pulls away and lets our minds fill in the blanks.  In doing that, it becomes a much more gruesome scene.  All the ruminations of the main players culminates in a stand-off between Nice Guy Eddie, Joe, and Mr. White.  Joe knows that Mr. Orange is a cop, Mr. White doesn't know that and is determined to protect him.  Nice Guy Eddie is incensed that Mr. White has pulled a gun on his dad. The scene climaxes as each character lets out with gunfire and everyone goes down.  The film ends with Mr. White leering of Mr. Orange's true nature and putting a gun to his head.  We hear cops yelling and Mr. White pulls the trigger.  A very loud wake up call to makers of films that have no real characters.",Null,1,3,29 October 1998
Rocky," The underdog
","In the 1976 Oscars, Rocky went up against such films as Taxi Driver, Network, All the Presidents Men and Bound For Glory.  Rocky won because it was not in the least bit cynical.  Sylvester Stallone gives the best performance of his career.  It's not weighed down with overwrought cliches, or explosions.  He's a nice guy from Philly who has a big heart.  All he's ever wanted to do is fight, and go the distance.  Apollo Creed gives Rocky the chance, and you're not given many chances like this.  In Rocky's eyes, we see the fear and excitement mixing.  He knows he won't win, he just wants to prove to the world, and to himself, that he's not a bum.",7,1,2,23 June 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A tale of jealousy
","Eyes Wide Shut examines what happens to a couple when one little truth is revealed.  Nicole Kidman tells husband Tom Cruise that she would've dropped everything in her life for one night with a Naval officer.  This sends Cruise into a state of unbalanced jealousy.  He imagines his wife with the officer, doing things.  Those thoughts send him wandering the streets of New York.  He runs into a friend of his and learns of a secret club.  From there, things get stranger for Tom.  Kubrick's last film features his usual exquisite camera work.  The centerpiece of the film reminded me of a cross between, The Overlook from The Shining and HAL's disembodided voice whenever one of the masked guests spoke.  The main theme of the film is jealousy, and what it can do to one's emotional state.   A haunting vision that will take time to grow on us.",7,0,0,16 July 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Very entertaining.
","This is not your ordinary crime thriller.  Guy Ritchie takes a venerable genre and gives it an injection of insanity.  Time slows down, speeds up, guns pop out of the woodwork and everyone steals from everyone else.  The plot is simple:  Four guys have one week to come up with a large sum of cash or they start losing fingers.  Along the way, we are introduced to a very colorful cast of characters that will all eventually cross paths in some form or another.  The film is written well, acted well and shot in a style that will not bore you at all. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you hooked, watch this one.  Guy Ritchie is definitely a director that we'll be seeing a lot from.",8,0,0,31 May 2000
The Untouchables," Gangbusters!
","The Untouchables is one hell of a film!  It packs a one two punch of violence balanced with tender drama and humor.  Robert DeNiro virtually disappears into the role of Al Capone.  Kevin Coster provides the right amount of stiffness to portray crusading lawman Eliot Ness.  Sean Connery is perfectly gruff and vulgar as the elder cop who teaches Ness the ins and outs of Chicago. Along with the slow motion shoot out at the train station that builds and builds in tension, you will not be able to get up from your seat at all!",Null,0,1,20 January 1999
Enemy at the Gates," The other side of WWII
","Enemy At The Gates gives us the view of WWII from the Russian point of view. The story takes place entirely during the German siege of Stalingrad.  In first few scenes, we see just how badly Hitler wanted this city.  What we are subjected to is a nightmarish scenario.  Russian infantrymen are herded from train cars into boats and ferryed across the Volga river.  While taking the dangerously slow trip, they are subject to fire from attacking German fighters.  If they survive, they still have to fight on land, or be shot as cowards.  There is little dialouge in these opening scenes and for once, I'm glad that there was no decision to put dialogue here.  You can almost compare the opening to a silent film, with the images flashing across the screen and expressions of the actors faces conveying all the information you need.  Once the opening chaos has died down, we begin to get to know Jude Law's Vassily, the famed sharpshooter.  Law plays him well.  A young man from the Urals who just happens to be a world class shot, but not to knowledgeable of the politics surrounding him.  Joseph Finnes is the political officer that begins to extol the virtues of this young man and begins to make him a larger than life hero.  Because of the damage inflicted by Vassily, the Germans send in their own sharpshooter.  Ed Harris plays Major Konig with steely eyed reserve.  His actions are carefully metered out and his silence shows his strength.  What starts out as a battle between the Russians and the Germans becomes a struggle between two men who are both the best at what they do.  What follows is a film that showcases great performances from Law and Harris and scenes of tension that will make you hold your breath.",7,0,0,23 March 2001
Die Hard," Exciting!
","Die Hard is one hell of a ride.  You've got terrorists, machine guns, buildings being blown up, and in the middle is Bruce Willis dodging glass and lead.  What makes Die Hard so much fun is the way it builds.  It starts out slow, lets you get to know the characters, then the action starts, and it keeps getting bigger and bigger.  Alan Rickman is great as Hans.  He is calm, cool, and he is smart.  The effects work is first rate, and if you have this on laser or DVD, turn it up.  Those guys at THX remastered this film for this purpose, to blow your speakers away!",9,0,0,12 May 1999
Psycho," Tony Perkins at his creepy best
","Watch Psycho and you'll find yourself glued to Anthony Perkins very strange Norman Bates.  He's a quiet lad, takes care of the hotel and his sick mother.  A bit odd, but nice enough.  Of course, we don't know what Norman's been up to in that old house.  Perkins allows Norman Bates to get under your skin, and he stays there.  He tricks you with politeness and sincerity, then his creepieness seeps in.  Shot on a very small budget, with the crew from the Alfred Hitchcock Presents tv show, Psycho is the ultimate low budget horror flick.  But what Hitchcock was able to do, it take horror out of the shadows, and shine light on it.  The real shock in Psycho comes at the end, where Norman is sitting there in the holding room.  Watch closely, and you'll see just how powerful 'Mother' really is.  Truly creepy.",9,5,9,8 June 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," They don't make movies like this anymore.
","I recently saw The Bridge on the River Kwai at the Cinerama Dome, and it was quite spectacular.  Unlike some of today's grand adventure films, you get to know the characters along with seeing great scenes of acting and cinematography.  Alec Guinness is at the top of his form as the single minded Colonel Nicholson.  The scene between Nicholson and Saito in Saito's hut is remarkable.  Nicholson still will not concede defeat, he even takes offense that other officers of different armies gave in and worked alongside the enlisted men.  Saito can't understand Nicholson's acceptance of his punishment, and it drives him crazy.  The film's plot has two stories that are beautifully intertwined.  Shears' return to the bridge is his only way to escape the bridge.  In the film's final act, the tension is turned up as the British commandos try to blow up the bridge, and a train, and only then does Nicholson realise what the bridge really is.  The Bridge on the River Kwai is one film that is hard to top, the only film able to do that is Lawrence of Arabia, both directed by the meticulous eye of David Lean.  One director who could put intimacy in epic circumstances.",10,55,67,19 February 1999
Die Hard with a Vengeance," John McClane is back and NYC is blowing up!
","Someone's got a thing for John McClane.  Bombs are going off around New York and if McClane doesn't do what Simon says, more things will go boom.  Along for the ride with the always watchable Bruce Willis is Samuel L. Jackson, a electronics store owner who just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  These two are off all over Manhattan figuring out Simon's little riddles.  Jeremy Irons is perfectly cast as the intelligent Simon.  He's shrewd, charming and knows how to get a job done.  Back in the director's chair is John McTiernan, overseeing the mayhem.  The action sequences are bigger, louder and wilder than before.  Car chases, shoot outs, and a really neat sequence involving a ship, a bridge and a truck highlight this action lovers delight.  So, buckle up, turn up the sound and get ready for a hell of a ride. New York is about to go boom!",8,41,47,9 July 2000
The Green Mile," One of the best films of the year.
","If you've read the novel, you'll know that The Green Mile is a story of extraordinary power, and the film does not let you down.  If you've not experienced the novel, be prepared for a story that you will not forget.  Through Frank Darabont's leisurely pace, we become a part of Tom Hanks' world.  We get to see his routines with the inmates, and with his men.  The day that John Coffey arrives on the mile, Hanks' character will never be the same. Some may complain about the running time, but as I stated earlier, the leisurely pace allows you to soak up every minute, every detail and every emotion that you will be exposed to.  The acting is top notch, and spread out over a very good ensemble cast.  Michael Clarke Duncan is wonderful as John Coffey. David Morse is perfectly cast as Brutus 'Brutal' Howell and Tom Hanks is wonderful as always. Doug Hutchinson brings such venom and spite to the role of Percy Whetmore, you will be satisfied with his fate.   The Green Mile is a film that pulls you in and doesn't let you go.  The ending is an emotional whallop that will unsettle you, but at the same time, you'll realize that it's the only way the story could end.  Another great story from Stephen King, who is making a name for himself as not only the most prolific horror novelist, but as a writer of intimate stories about ordinary events, that become the most extraordinary tales of friendship.",10,1,1,18 December 1999
Jaws," Great!
","Through the power of suggestion, Steven Spielberg made Jaws one of the best scare films ever.  It's probably a good thing that the shark didn't work half the time, since in certain parts it doesn't look that convincing. Apart from that, what makes Jaws so much fun to watch over and over again is the amount of time that Spielberg invests with his three main characters. One of the best sequences is the second attack.  Brody slowly starts moving toward the pond, but his panic increases and he explodes into a full run. Pushing this along is John Williams' score that will forever be implanted in your mind.  The film reaches a palm sweating climax as the three shark hunters pursue, and get pursued by the shark.  Great movie that spawned three inferior sequels.",10,2,4,7 May 1999
Kingpin," Bill Murray at his best!
","Bill Murray pretty much steals the show every time he's on the screen. He's sleazy, he's smarmy and he's very funny.  With that comb-over going nuts at the big game, and his victory dance at the end makes Kingpin that much better.  That's not saying that the rest of the film isn't good, it is. Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Vanessa Angel make a very odd partnership. An Amish bowling whiz, a one handed ex-bowler, and a very sexy hustler scheme and dream to make it to Reno, but of course they have to beat Big Ern.",7,25,34,10 July 1999
Raging Bull," Brutal, honest, a mesmerizing film
","Raging Bull is a film that is not easy to watch.  It is brutal, it is honest and it is a completely mesmerizing film.  The boxing scenes alone are enough to make you cringe.  The sights and sounds that Scorsese employs to bring you to the feral level of boxers is amazing.  Sound of wild animals bring you into the brutality of the sport.  The sequence in which Jake beats his opponent so hard that the poor fool just collapses is amazing.  The crowning achievement is the final fight of Jake's career.  When Sugar Ray Robinson raises his arm, Scorsese lets everything fly.  We see Jake stagger against the ropes, we see the blood, we hear the punches, and we see the horror wash across Viki LaMotta's face.  But that's all the boxing scenes, what is at the heart of the film is Jake's relationship with his brother Joey, and Jake's insecurities in life.  He is not the most sympathetic person.  He is violent, suspicious and stubborn.  Through DeNiro's amazing performance we see LaMotta as a complex and tragic figure.  The scene in the Florida jail cell toward the end of the film is powerful.  Jake starts pounding the wall and shouts 'Why?'  In that one scene we see a man finally coming to grips with his life, and his demons.",Null,2,2,24 September 1998
The Iron Giant," Outstanding!
","It's too bad that The Iron Giant didn't do better during its' theatrical release.   Here we have an intelligent, and entertaining film about a boy who befriends a giant robot from origins unknown.   The characters are not dumbed down in anyway, and there is no need to break out into song as many recent animated films have done.  We are carried along by the story and the curiosity about what will happen next to Hogarth and his giant friend.   One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end when the Giant and Hogarth are knocked out of the sky. Once they land, the Giant shows more emotion and range than many living actors can muster. The result is a scene that's full of power and emotion.  The climax of the film is fitting, but I can't say what it is, you have to see it for yourself.  A great film to show to the entire family.",9,0,1,13 December 1999
Shrek," Utterly charming and highly entertaining.
","As Shrek opens up, you realize that you're not going to be viewing a 'classic' fairy tale.  With a very irreverant sense of humor, the film ventures into uncharted territories that will make you laugh uncontrollably while your kids wonder what's so funny.  The story is a simple one.  Shrek and Donkey have been given a task of rescuing Princess Fiona.  Once this is accomplished, Lord Farquuad will remove the fairy tale refugees from Shrek's swamp.  Along the way in this simple tale, our hero learns to open himself up to others, and by midway through the film you'll know the outcome.  But, you will be so charmed and entertained by the story that you won't care that you figured out the ending in the middle of the film.  The animation is amazing to watch, and with the field of animation, you can get away with many things that you can not do with live action.  Overall, Shrek is a delightful film for all ages.   Take the kids and try not to be charmed.",Null,0,0,3 June 2001
Ben-Hur," One of the best big screen epics.
","I recently had the opportunity to see Ben-Hur on a 70ft screen and I have to say, if you have the chance, see it this way!  The super wide vistas that is captured on film look puny on TV and even then, the whole movie is cropped to fit the screen.  If you have a large screen TV, that may do the trick but it's still no match for a giant movie screen.  The best example of this would be to watch the famed chariot race.  Every inch of screen is used to pack in so much detail, your brain almost goes into an overload just trying to take it in. Having said that, the film still holds up after all these years.  Charlton Heston is perfectly cast as the title character.  Betrayed by his boyhood friend, Ben-Hur is sold into slavery and sent to die aboard the Roman galleons.  During a spectacular battle, Ben-Hur rescues his Roman captor and is given a hero's welcome in Rome where is made a citizen.  But, this cannot dissuade Ben-Hur from his personal vendetta against Messala.  He gets his chance in the chariot race, and I have to say that the chariot race has not been matched.  Ben-Hur, like Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Spartacus, is a film that needs to be seen on a large screen.  That's the only way to take in the grandeur of those spectacular scenes that range from the highly intimate, to a frame that literally boasts a cast of thousands.",10,2,5,5 April 2001
The Sixth Sense," Made me jump.
","If a movie professes to be scary, edge of your seat, frightening, etc; and it doesn't live up to that claim, I feel cheated.  The Sixth Sense lives up to its claim of being rather scary.  There are moments that will make you jump, and there are moments that will make your hair stand on end.  Bruce Willis is very good as the shrink who tries to help the young boy who sees dead people.  Hayley Joel Osmet is very good in his role.  There is a certain conviction to his voice and you can see it in his eyes, that he really believes he sees dead people.  The way he relates to Willis is refreshing in movies.  Most of the time, kids are either saying something smart or acting silly, not this kid.  He's tortured, and he's scared.  The film delivers the goods and even sneaks in a great twist.  Better bring someone along with you, you might need to grab hold of them.",8,0,0,15 August 1999

What makes it rise above the other films in the genre is the sure hand of the creative team, a duo responsible for many episodes of The X-Files.  Here, that general uneasiness that works well on TV, works double time in a feature film.   The set pieces of the film are done in such intricate ways, you can't help but watch.  The plane explosion is quite disturbing, and that's just the beginning.  From there, we are plunged into a film where strange things will happen, and not in the way that you would expect.  The performances are well played by the young cast, and Tony Tod has a delightful little part as an undertaker.

Rear Window," Vintage Hitchcock.
","I was lucky to see Rear Window after it had been restored by the wizards who have restored such films as Vertigo and Lawrence of Arabia.  The film looks great.  You can see Lars Thorwald's lit cigar in his dark apartment and the sunset has color that hasn't been seen since the original theatrical run.  The film will never age.  Hitchcock's masterful direction draws you into the life of L.B. Jeffries and his confinement to a wheelchair.  The only things we are allowed to see is what Jeffries can see.   One stormy night, Jeffries hears a scream that sets his suspicions running.  Did Lars Thorwald kill his wife?  If not, why is he acting so strangely? Hitchcock pulls us deeper into the mystery the same way that Jeffries hooks his nurse and girlfriend.  Eventually, they start doing all the footwork and all Jeffries can do is watch.   The fun of Rear Window is watching the tension mount as Hitchcock work his cinematic touches to bring the fear and anxiety from the screen, and have it do a number on your nerves.   A great film that will always be entertaining.",10,0,2,3 February 2000

Just as dreams in real life tend to blur the line betweenfantasy and reality, Craven fuses his film with images thatborder on a dream state.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," truly magical
","Twenty one years ago in late August my mom took me to see Star Wars.  It is the first movie that I can remember seeing in a theatre.  Being four years old I didn't know what to expect, but when the lights went out and that fanfare came on, I was mesmerized.  Then the movie started, and when those ships roared across the screen, I just sat there, amazed.  As the film progressed I was introduced to all of the characters that populate this film.  I remember being frightened when I first saw Darth Vader.  I remember the battle over the Death Star, the X-Wings and TIE Fighters blowing up and Luke being chased by Vader.  Then, the Death Star explodes.  Needless to say, I've never forgotten that experience.Twenty years later, I was thrilled to relive the experience.  I went to see Star Wars again in the theatre.  It was truly magical, I felt like I was four again, and going to see my first movie.  This movie will always be my favorite, sure there are other films that are arguably better.

Tarzan," Visually stunning

Disney's version of the Edgar Rice Burroughs story brings a grand, lush visual splendor to the jungle that can only be seen in animation.  What's nice about this Disney adventure is the fact that the characters do not break out into song.  Phil Collins' songs reinforce the images on the screen and do not intrude on the narrative.  The film is light on its feet and hits all the right buttons.  The vocal casting is good.  Lance Henrikson brings the right amount of menace to Kerchek and Minnie Driver was perfectly cast as Jane.  As stated before, the film is animated in a lush manner that no live action film could accomplish easily.  The deep canvas technique that was employed moves the action so effortlessly, you might get a little dizzy from all the twists and turns.  All in all, a fine adventure from the folks at Disney.",7,1,1,6 February 2000
The Thin Red Line," ponderous
","The Thin Red Line, the second WWII film to come out in 1998, is a film that aspires to greatness and falls down in its climb.  Visually, it's beautiful to look at.  Two time Oscar winner John Toll has given the hills of Guadalcanal a luster that reminded me of his previous efforts, Legends of the Fall and Braveheart.  The battle scenes between the American and Japanese forces are heart pounding and brutal, there is a sense of dread as you watch the soldiers advance up a hill that has a machine gun pillbox at the top.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't know what it wants to be.  The action sequences are good, but in order for them to work, you have to care about the characters, and in order for that to work, you have to know who they are!  The Thin Red Line boasts a good cast, but they come and go so quickly on the screen you don't have time to connect with them.  The voice over narration adds to the confusion.  I found myself wondering, who was talking?  Toward the end of the movie, I found myself thinking, I can't tell the soldiers apart!  Maybe that's what Terence Malick wanted, maybe not.  In any case, The Thin Red Line was a failed epic.  It had a chance for greatness, but it lingered to long on the philosophical views of war, and did not let you get to know the men the way that Saving Private Ryan did.",Null,1,2,3 January 1999

","After the success of Star Wars you would think that it can't get any better. Well it did.  Empire is much more ambitious than the first one, and it shows.  The story is more involved, it carries the story arcs from the first one over flawlessly.  The Battle of Hoth is amazing to watch, as is the asteroid chase.  Luke begins his training as a Jedi and we see in the tree that he is going the way of Vader.  Han and Leia squabble but they slowly start to warm up to each other in a classic scene of love finding its way through dialogue that never mentions their love for each other.  Yoda's philosophy of 'do or do not.'  are words to live by.  Throw in the smooth talking Lando and a light saber duel that is truly exciting and you got yourself one hell of a follow up to one of the greatest films of all time.

Gladiator," Spectacular!
","Ridley Scott has breathed new life into the sword and sandal epic with Gladiator.  Using modern visual effects, Gladiator shows us a Rome that hasn't been seen since, well Roman times.  There is a thriving metropolis and at the center of this mass of humanity is the coloseium.  Ridley Scott's films are wonders of art direction and costume design and Gladiator is no exception. The sumptuousness of Rome in its heyday is wonderful to look at.  With all of the eye candy that Scott gives you, you almost forget that there is a story unfolding, and it's quite a story.  Russell Crowe gives a strong performance as Maximus, the disgraced Roman general. Juaquin Phoenix is perfectly sniveling and underhanded as the newly crowned emperor Commodus. There are scenes of quiet treachery and intrigue and then there are scenes of blood stirring combat in the arena. Gladiator is an epic that spares no expense in giving you thrills from ancient Rome.",8,0,0,9 May 2000

Goodfellas," One of the best mob movies ever made.
","Martin Scorsese pulls you into the world of Henry Hill so effortlessly, you don't even realize that nearly two and a half hours have gone by.  Henry Hill gives us first person narration in his rise through the ranks of the mob.  He goes from being a small time hood, to a major player. Along the way, we meet his partners in crime: Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVitto.  These two are played with finesse and bombast by Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  We get glimpses into the lives of wiseguys.  They have money, power and girls.  But underneath the glossy surface, there's always the treat of violence that could erupt at any time.  An off the cuff remark from Henry sends Tommy into a rant that borderlines a catastrophe.  Scorsese pulls no punches in delivering the violence that fills the lives of these people.  Life in the mob is not a glamorous life, it's filled with threats, violence, and paranoia.  One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end where Henry starts out his day at 6:55 AM and it gets worse from there. Scorsese pulls you into Henry's frantic world by the voiceover, and pretty soon, you're concerned about the dinner that Henry is planning.  Goodfellas is one of the best films ever made about life in the mob.  It shows the highs and the lows, and the danger that lays in each.",10,0,0,6 April 2000
The Birds," Interesting
","The Birds has the usual Hitchcock touches.  A chase, guilt, interesting camera technique and birds.  The story starts out innocently enough, with birds acting weird.  They soon start attacking people and gradually their attacks escalate in ferocity.   What I liked about the movie was the way Hitchcock built up the tension leading to the attacks.  He didn't unleash his villians until about half way through the film.  In that time we get to know the characters in the peaceful town of Bodega Bay.  Once all the introductions are in place, the birds start their rampage.  I enjoyed the way the birds lighted upon the playground equipment as Tippi Hedren sat on the bench.  The choice of no score was interesting.  The soundtrack is filled with the screeching of birds gone mad, and for a nearly forty year old film, it still holds up well.  I would like to see The Birds done as a special edition DVD, see if they can boost the sound up to what Hithcock would have wanted.",7,1,1,9 August 1999

He gets beat up by his dead girlfriend, a hick, a dead and decaying woman, and his own hand.  Sam Raimi's love for cartoons is evident in the sound effects and the camera work.  Raimi manages to scare you and make you laugh at the same time.  The best part of the movie is when Ash gets his rig ready to go fight the evil.  The music builds, Ash acts macho and the camera dollies up to his face for some great phrase, and what comes out is the one word that sums it up:  Groovy!",Null,0,1,29 October 1998
From Here to Eternity," Grand romance
","From Here To Eternity will always be remembered for Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr's kiss in the waves.  What viewers should also remember is the acting from all the principle characters and secondary characters.  There is not a flawed performance from anyone. Montgomery Clift is perfectly stubborn and Frank Sinatra is loud but likeable.  Ernest Borgnine brings a quiet menace to the role of Fatso Judson.  The scene where Sinatra is brought into the stockade shows the menace and joy in Bornine's eyes and the fear in Sinatra's.  Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed are the women who fall in love with soldiers.  Kerr has a loveless relationship with her husband and falls for Lancaster's no nonsense Sgt. Warden.  Reed loves Clift, but they can never know true love.  Clift loves the army, and he's too stubborn and proud to ever bow before anyone.  Set against the backdrop of Hawaii before the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the film remains a timeless classic of epic, but doomed romance.",8,1,1,7 February 2000

Al Pacino is the doomed Michael who will one day take over the family business.  Try as he might to avoid it, it is his destiny. The cast is outstanding, the script is top notch and what other film could spend the entire first forty minutes at a wedding?  Watch this with the equally great Godfather Part II and the follow up Godfather III.  Some will say that Godfather III is the weakest one of them all.  I say it is a perfect ending to an opera of one of the greatest gangster sagas of all time.",Null,1,2,20 January 1999
