Casablanca," What a film!!!!
","Celluloid perfection, plus a touch of real magic.  Why doesn't anyone make films like this today? I've just been told I have to use four lines for a genuine comment.  But a work of genius doesn't really need four lines - it just wants you to sit back and watch in awe.  This may not be the greatest film ever made - may not, but it's certainly in there with a chance alongside another great but undervalued film, 'The Third Man'.",10,1,1,15 August 2000
American Beauty," Having read the reviews, I'm glad I'm not alone
",American Beauty really is a bad film.  How could it have beaten The Sixth Sense (in a bad year)?  I keep thinking of The Emperor's New Clothes - and I feel like the little boy.  There was a time when great films won Oscars - and many great films didn't.  'American Beauty' is a travesty that will not be remembered; that it has won so many Oscars simply brings the whole organisation into disrepute.,2,0,0,1 September 2000
American Beauty," It's amazing how often ephemeral rubbish wins Oscars
","Really, it's not worth spending 1000 words on rubbish like this.  I suspect that it was politically correct for the great and good in Hollywood to vote for a film that portrays marriage as damaging and unhealthy and normal family life as sterile and meaningless, that shows the military as sexually repressed, murderous and dysfunctional and a gay partnership as my, my so clean and wholesome.  Get real - why should anyone remember such a trite and cliche-ridden film in 10 years time?  But if anything in the film deserved an Oscar it was Annette Bening's performance. She was worlds better than anything else about the film.",2,0,1,15 August 2000
Saving Private Ryan," A great, flawed, film
","What an amazing first half hour.  How could anyone think of war as glorious after seeing that.  There are so many fine touches in camera-work and direction that you need to see to believe - the sheep wandering past the unit, the homely sandwiches and so on.  So clever to have the rescue unit itself hostile to the rescue - after all, each son who died left a mother bereft, and that is what Ryan himself felt at the end of the film.  It is such a shame that the last half hour of the film became a conventional war movie.  Spielberg has made a great movie - in parts greater than anything that has ever been made about the Second World War.  But his last half hour is an indulgence which lets the rest of the film down.  Nevertheless, my father joined the (British) Royal Marines in February 1939 and fought throughout to May 1945, including the Normandy landings.  For the first time on screen I have now seen something like what he must have gone through. How did our parents/grandparents do it?  And aren't we so lucky that we have not had to?",Null,0,0,14 August 1999
28 Days Later...," A total turkey
","This film is a total turkey -  the worst film I have seen in a long time. It is totally derivative and stems from the basic premise of 'The Day of the Triffids' but totally lacks the logic and coherence that John Wyndham brought to his story.  I suppose that it could be used as an exercise for budding screenwriters to be shown how to avoid illogical plot lines and characterisations, but this really is a turkey of a movie.  It is difficult to see how any studio could have been persuaded to finance something quite as bad as this.  If your voting system allowed a 0, that's what I would have given this totally worthless drivel.",1,10,20,20 December 2003
