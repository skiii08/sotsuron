Minority Report," Good with a pinch of bad.
","I recently saw this movie and for the most part enjoyed it.  The story is very compelling and the actors do a good job of portraying the various predicaments they are in.  I liked the special effects.  There were however, a couple of sexual scenes which are as innappropriate as they are unnecessary for the plot, especially when none of the main characters are in any way involved, which came close to spoiling it.  Probably not a family movie.",8,0,0,27 July 2002
