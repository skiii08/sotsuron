The Blair Witch Project," Booo...
","...did I scare you?If I didn't then I don't rate BWP chances of doing so either.  In fact the only thing scary about this whole movie was that I paid to see it.  OK, may be I'm being harsh.  It was a really good idea.  But the execution of the concept was poor.  From what I can gather, the premise of the whole film is that it was meant to feel 'real', thus getting away from typical horror. Wonderful idea.  The problem with the film is than no one acts the way any normal human would act in a similar situation.  When totally lost in a big forest, don't just go marching in a general direction, follow the river, it's bound to lead somewhere.  I'm a city boy, but even I know to do that. When face with a big scary house with lots of weird stuff happening, don't go into the house for a quick viewing, run in the opposite direction at high speed.  Perhaps this is somewhat of a British view.  Generally when you wanderer any forest in the UK it will have some associated legend of ghosts, murderers or the like.  You just can't get scared about it. 
However, if the film-makers want to make people believe a story then make it 'real'.  Using camcorders and a documentary style, don't make it 'real', the characters make it 'real'.",5,0,2,27 March 2000
Lost in Translation," Well... Bill Murray was good...
","Lost in Translation is a film about a relationship between a faded Hollywood star and a bored wife, set against the background of Tokyo.I'm unsure how to view this movie, if it were a book I think I would characterise it as interesting but poorly written.  The film is very much about a message rather than pure entertainment, and that message is put across as much visually as it is verbally.  The basic message seems to be about the problems with communication that exist at all levels of society, with the difficulties that the main American characters have interacting with Japanese society mirroring their own problems with their own private relationships.  The film manages to get this message across, however I found much of the film dull.  Why all the staring out of windows over Tokyo, staring out of car windows, and wandering around Pachinko parlours.  It gets the message across that people are bored/jet lagged, in a foreign culture, and allows for some nice street scenes of Japan, but all this could have been foregone with a bit more dialogue and acting.  Just because the character is meant to be bored does not mean that the audience has to be bored with them.  Therefore I think several minutes could be cut from the film without damaging the message.  Additionally, the relationship between Murray and Johansson didn't make me feel for either of the characters.  The way I saw it they were both quite selfish, well certainly as selfish as their respective spouses.  And I think this is where the film failed.  You were left asking: A couple of people you don't really feel for are having a boring time on a business trip in Tokyo.  So what?'   
As for the acting: Bill Murray was excellent (and certainly rescued this film), Johansson was nice to look at, but didn't really say anything of meaning - she seemed characterless,  the assorted Japanese characters were all excellent, Ribisi wasn't really in the movie, and  Faris did a nice cameo as the airhead actress.However, overall I felt although I understood the movie, it was too intellectualtoo cleverbasically required too much work analysing what everything meant rather than generating feelings or enjoying the film.  I almost felt that the film needed a little guidebook to let the viewer know the meaning and symbolism of each shot.",6,1,2,11 February 2004
