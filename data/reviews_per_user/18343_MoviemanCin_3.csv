The Lobster," This is a terrible and cruel movie.
","This is a terrible movie which makes absolutely no sense. It's slow, plodding, poorly written and acted, pretentious, and incredibly cruel. People are sent to a sadistic and fascist 'hotel' where they must find a mate in 45 days or the're turned into animals. The maid grinds her posterior on the groins of male guests to arouse, but not satisfy them. WTF?If he fails, David (Colin Farrel) wants to be turned into a lobster. This is a crustacean which crawls on the bottom of the ocean eating dead and decaying material, and if caught, is thrown alive into a boiling pot to be eaten.It's also very cruel. A donkey is shot in the opening scene. A woman kicks a dog to death for no apparent reason. Later a woman is blinded because she showed affection for David. I suspect that this was supposed to be a dark comedy, and a parody on love and relationships. But cruelty is NOT funny.I think perhaps the director is trying to resolve some emotional issues from his childhood. Maybe his mommy didn't let him have a dog, and he's taking it out on all of us. I will never watch another one of his films.Please do yourself a favor and do NOT see this movie. Save your money to go watch a good movie, or at least one which is not this cruel.",3,10,15,7 June 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," I Love This Film!
","This is a very original action film with great writing, direction, stunts, special effects and acting. It gives numerous homages to the great spy films of the 60's and 70's, especially the Bond films, while simultaneously turning some of their conventions on their heads.The opening scene set to 'Money For Nothing' was excellent. I also enjoyed Galahad kicking the s**t out of the thugs in the pub. But the best scene by far was the very colorful exploding heads of the bad guys set to 'Pomp and Circumstance'! It sort of reminded my of the Staja scene in 'A Clockwork Orange', which was set to the same music. That one made me laugh out loud.But the best thing was that the villain was an Eco Terrorist who thinks more about the planet than human beings. As the late, great George Carlin once said 'The planet's not going anywhere. We are.' And he's impaled and dies at the end. Too bad Eggsy couldn't have taken out Al Gore at the same time!I'm definitely on board for the sequel!",8,3,6,9 June 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," A long, dull, pointless car/truck chase through the desert.
","This movie was technically brilliant, and deserved all the technical Oscars it won.I had not planned to see it because I already saw this movie 30 years ago in the original Road Warrior. Why watch it again? But then I was surprised to discover that it was nominated for best picture, so I decided to watch it on DVD.To my dismay it was just a long, dull, pointless car/truck chase through a generic desert. It basically just a remake of Road Warrior, and not as well done (technical brilliance aside).As to the actors: Charlize Theron was good as Fuiosa, but I never did buy Tom Hardy as Max.Overall I was disappointed.",6,7,13,7 June 2016
