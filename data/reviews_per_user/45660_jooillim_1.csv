Mission: Impossible III," MI 3 delivers!
","I saw this film in 70mm, and it rocked my socks off. Though pure, unadulterated action, it gives just enough character study, just enough exposition (all the things that, say, National Treasure utterly failed to do), to let me dive deeper in. Tom is fine, he does all the action stuff, he gets to drive the boat, but the real star here is JJ Abrams. This guy brings panache and real story telling skills to this baby. He takes a risk by starting the movie at the near-end and then jumping back to the start, but nothing is as it seems, and the risk pays off as the story stays ahead of you. My biggest criticism is that Seymour Hoffman isn't given enough to do. I mean, it's Capote, so I just expected him to be used a little more. Ignore the lame press. See it on the big screen! It delivers.",8,2,4,26 May 2006
