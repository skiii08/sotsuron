The Blair Witch Project," Could this movie have been more retarded???
","This is without a doubt the most ridiculous movie I have ever seen. When I walked into the theater to see this movie, I was so excited about it. I knew it wasn't going to be any Exorcist. No movie can compare to that. While watching this movie I found myself several times nearly falling asleep. I have no idea how anyone could get scared in a piece of garbage like this. When the movie was over, I saw many people laughing. I heard the person sitting behind me say that BWP was the least scariest movie he had ever seen. Even my friend who is scared of every horror movie possible was like, 'that was not scary at all.' The movie's desperate attempt to try and scare people just doesn't work. Oooooooo they hear sounds in the woods while they're sleeping. They see rocks at their camp that weren't there before. Oh my god, that's soooo scary. The only thing that should have scared those 3 people was when the other 2 found the guy's who disappeared tongue. Even when they found his tongue wasn't scary. It was just gross. Everyone I know who saw this movie agreed with me. This movie is a disgrace. And now they're making a Blair Witch 3 after the 2nd one was a flop. Get a clue! One last comment: God help the people who wanted to make BWP.1/10",1,6,11,2 July 2001
Mission: Impossible II," MUCH better than the first one
","I personally thought M:I-2 was MUCH better than the first M:I. The first one had a complicated storyline and barely had any action except for the train scene at the end. M:I-2 was much easier to follow and there was MUCH MORE action. I loved the special effects and the music was so good. And as Thandie Newton put it, 'Beautifully orchestrated fight sequences.' I thought the acting was so good. Dougray Scott played an awesome bad guy. Tom was much more aggressive. He also showed his amazing athletic ability. Thandie Newton was also great in this film. The places the movie was filmed at were beautiful. The action was so awesome. I haven't seen that much action in a film since Speed starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Tom walks across a room surrounded with fire in slow motion. The fire is reflecting in Dougray's eyes and Tom has suck a slick and angry look on his face. It's one of those good guy and bad guy have an eye-to eye moment. The music playing on the part fits that moment perfectly. Everyone disagrees with me, but that is such an intense part in the film. I really enjoyed the rock climbing scene and the scene at the end when Dougray and Tom are fighting by hand and with no guns. In every scene there was action. The first one was boring and confusing, but M:I-2 kept me entertained the whole time.",Null,0,0,1 December 2000
The Insider," I absolutely loved this movie
","This movie is fantastic. When I saw this movie, I figured it was just going to be a boring and long movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sure it was long, but The Insider kept your attention for every second of the film. Russell Crowe, once again, is magnificent. I just can't get over what a great actor he is. Every character Russell plays he makes seem so real and I couldn't help to think that Russell was robbed out of the award for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. His Oscar win for the role of Maximus in Gladiator (for which he deserved all the way) makes up for it though. He absolutely amazes me. Not only is he SO CUTE (well, not in The Insider because he played a 53-year-old, but he looks cute in most of his other performances) but he is also an amazing actor. Al Pacino also gave an excellent performance. He too makes his characters seem real in every movie he is in. The cast for this movie was phenomenal. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat. I absolutely loved this movie. It's definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, you have to go see it and I guarantee that you will thoroughly enjoy it. I give it a 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,3 April 2001
Speed," One of the best action movies
","I saw Speed a long time ago, I think in 1995. When I saw it for the first time in a long time yesterday, I didn't remember much. I didn't remember the bus jump or the part where the bus nearly tipped over when it was making a sharp turn or the part where several people were about to die in an elevator in the beginning of the movie. Even still, I enjoyed Speed even more than when I saw it the first time. It has so much action in it. I was never bored. This movie was thrilling, action packed, and suspenseful. It was fun to look back and see how Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves were back then. As I was seeing this movie for the first time in so long, I noticed something about Sandra Bullock. She seemed a bit annoying in this film. Don't get me wrong, Sandra is definately my favorite actress, but looking back on this film, I thought she could have made her character seem more real. She has improved so much as an actress since then though and evidence of that is her performances in A Time To Kill, Hope Floats, 28 Days, Miss Congeniality, and much more. Keanu Reeves usually doesn't impress me much with his acting, but I thought he gave a pretty good performance in this film. The cast of this movie was pretty good and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It is simply flawless, definately Keanu's best film next to The Gift and The Matrix. I give Speed a 10 out of 10.",10,1,3,13 June 2001
The Replacements," Absolutely hilarious, a GREAT movie
","This movie was hilarious. It had drama, romance, comedy, and a little action thrown in. I saw it twice in the movie theater, and both times I found myself laughing uncontrollably. The whole audience was laughing. One guy in the audience was laughing so hard that I thought he would pee in his pants! My stomach hurt after the movie because I was laughing so much. It may not have the deepest message in the world, but it did have a good message. No matter how many disadvantages you have, you can still succeed. And like Gene Hackman said, 'You know what separates the winner from the losers? Getting back on that horse after you've been kicked off.' I also love the romance and Brooke and Keanu's relationship in the movie. It didn't show them in bed or anything. Instead, Keanu was a bit shy around her at first. I thought the whole love story thing was really romantic. The whole cast was great and the music rocked also.=)",10,2,3,6 December 2000
