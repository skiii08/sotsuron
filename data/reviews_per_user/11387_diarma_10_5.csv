Scarface," One of my favourites, in all genres!
","This film will always stand out as one of my favourite films even although there is a very long list of favourites.One thing makes this the movie it is, Al Pacino. It wouldn't have been the same no matter who played, no America or Brit out there could have pulled off a Cuban 'Political' Refugee with so much class, Oliver Stone said that he made the film around Al Pacino playing Tony Montana and it was very well done indeed.The story itself is nothing out of the ordinary, no twists or mysterious events, its just a straight down the line Gangster film which is very good to watch while at the same time absorbing Al Pacino's acting talents.This is not something I have just watched, I seen it for the first time over 10 years ago but I am just getting around to commenting on it for the first time, I would like to think that the current generation have already enjoyed this movie though.",9,0,1,26 June 2007
Constantine," my opinion
","I've watched it once and intend to watch it several more times.I understand that it was based on a comic book which I didn't know until 10 minutes before watching it.I think knowing the comic book story will benefit others when watching the movie first time. Personally I didn't get much of it. I need to watch it a few more times to get to grips with the full story.The Gabriel thing confused me, I wasn't too sure what that was all about.The action and supernatural effects were second to none.I look forward to reading more comments that can help me understand this movie.",4,0,3,22 March 2005
In the Name of the Father," A deep and powerful movie
","I've seen this movie a few times now and each time I watch it, I get more and more sucked into it.Its one of these films that Jim Sheridan has opted for the right man to play Gerry Conlon, it just doesn't seem that anyone else but Daniel Day Lewis could have pulled this off. His posture, his accent, his mannerism, he just pulled off the character of a mischievous petty thief.The entire story of how they are convicted just because they are Belfast boys in London who happen to be around on the night of the pub bombing, then held for 7 days and nights under new legislation, beaten and torchered to the point the easiest way to end it all is to sign a confession to something they never done, its all very realistic and you feel part of it.The court room scene as they are being convicted, both the Guilford 4 & Maguire 7 is one of the most touching scenes I've seen in a movie, just knowing that there are 11 folk, completely innocent, watching a Crown Lawyer sit and tell a jury of how they were involved in explosives and the murder of innocent people when the truth is every last piece of evidence against them is a lie, it actually gets you on the verge of rage. Think of it in context like this, all 11 members who were trialled and imprisoned totalled 120 years combined for something they were not even remotely involved in. This is what makes the said Court Room scene more thrilling.The way the English police are portrayed into being completely anti Irish due to the ongoing current political circumstances is sickening, it really makes me despise how Governmental bodies worked in those days and it gives you the idea that similar occurrences probably do happen in modern times.I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be sucked into a film for over 2 hours. Unless of course you are a supporter of the British justice system and preach that there is no discrepancies there whatsoever :)",8,1,3,13 February 2008
Saw," Warped events
","I wasn't sure what to expect of this film but it certainly wasn't the horror film I anticipated.I would aim this more at a 'Seven' similarity other than compared it to titles such a Haloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday 13th etc. There is much more a thrilling story to it with lots of twists in it.Make no mistake about it though, there are some of the most morbid ideas within this film, some of the execution material doesn't quite give you the boak other than make you wonder what kind of mind created it! The twist at the end thought was brilliantly thought of, it was something I never even expected. That shouldn't give anything away so hopefully no spoiler required.Overall, I gave it a 5 because as much as the I felt the story was decent, the acting was nothing out of this world and this genre of movie isn't my cup of tea anyway.Worth a watch though.",4,0,0,26 June 2007
Casino Royale," Was this really a Bond film???
","I was like before I watch most Bond films very excited about it. The film got off to a breathtaking start with the chases on the rooftops and I believed we were going to be in for one of the best Bond films.However, as the film went on and no MAJOR plots were in place, I started to fear the worse.In all James Bond films of the past the 'bad guy' has been involved in a plan to do something major, take over the world etc etc but if I am not mistaken this bad guy was a money launderer and all he seemed to achieve was beating him at Poker at Casino Royale and obviously the accountant from MI5 HQ was in on it but surely if you make a James Bond movie then there has to be a better script that this, especially when Daniel Craig was living up to usual James Bond standards.I hope Daniel Craig does another movie and it is better than this one, I was left so disappointed when the ending came.",5,3,4,4 February 2007
