The Blair Witch Project," One of the greatest movies ever
","After I read some of these comments, I got mad. How can you not like this movie. How could you think something was scarier than this. In someone's comment they said that they wished he would've seen Deep Blue See. That looks like the worst movie ever made. How could you compare that with The Blair Witch. The Blair Witch Project was the most original idea in years. It shows us in a time where movies can have any special effects that they want, the things that really scare us is the things that we can't see. A great movie that is full of depth and originality. I remember seeing it opening night. I traveled an hour to the nearest showing and I was scared for days after that. If you haven't seen it yet. Stop reading about it. The more you know the less you will like it.",Null,0,0,16 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pretty Good
","A couple weeks before it opened, I got so excited just like everyone else so when I went to see it three days after it opened, I wondered if it was going to be a let-down. I forgot all about that after I got in there and people were haveing light saber fights and starting cheers and stuff. I knew that this was going to be good. When the opening credits came on, you felt just like watching Star Wars. It sent a chill down my spine. So I started watching it and it was turning out to be pretty good. It wasn't exactly like the originals, but it still had the good old Star Wars feeling. The light saber battle at the end was great, the whole movie was basically great. Except of course for Jar Jar. I would've given anything for that thing to die. It would have made the movie ten times better. Well that's enough about Jar Jar. Let's just pray he's not in the next one. I liked how the movie set up everything for the next two. That was the best thing about it. I think the next one is going to be great. George Lucas won't really have to try to impress people with it and just do what he does. But all in all, it was a great movie and can't wait for the next one.",Null,0,0,29 June 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," great movie
","When you go and watch this movie for the first time, you think that it'll just be another action movie with some plot that just has people shooting each other. But this movie was different. It had everything. There was even some growing of age scenes. Well there was alot of those between John and the terminator. That's why the movie was so good. The terminator was like John's father that he never had. Directed by James Cameron from Titanic. Way better than Titanic. Titanic was alright, but nothing great. So check out this movie sometime.",Null,1,1,29 July 1999
Good Will Hunting," One of the best of the decade
","Good Will Hunting was a movie that had everything in it. Everything that makes a movie good. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck do the greatest script ever wrote. By far the best dialouge in any movie I've seen. Well this and 'Pulp Fiction'. The acting was great also. It was an all around good movie with alot of meaning to it. It's almost even a coming of age sort of film. The whole friendship between Matt and Ben really paid off. You could tell in the movie that they were friends even off screen. Great acting by both of them and not to forget Robin Williams who does his best acting job yet. Even Will and Chuckie's friends were good actors. Ben's brother Casey did a great job and that other guy, I don't know his name, but he was in 'Dazed and Confused', did a great job also. So if you're in the mood for a good movie about friendship and relationships, I highly recommend this movie.",Null,0,1,14 July 1999
The Breakfast Club," The best movie ever made!!
","By far the best movie ever made. Without a doubt. I'm a huge fan of all the 80's teen movies, but this one is unbelievable. John Hughs does a great job with the script and the directing. The cover shots that used were great. You don't really see that many cover shots in a movie. But this one has tons and it shows you how the other kids are reacting. I'm only a freshman in highschool right now, but I can still relate to it. I remember watching this movie in 6th grade and I related to it back then. I've seen this movie so many times that I memorized it. And I'm still not bored of it. The more I see it, the more I like it. Here's a few things of my perspective of the characters. I'll try to make it short, but I could probably write a book about this movie.John-A toubled kid who cracks some funny lines to impress his classmates. He has his problems at home, with getting beaten by his dad and he has his problems at school with basically everyone. They all think that he's a big joke and is just clowning his ways through highschool. The predictable thing would be to show that this kid is very emotional and bunch of other junk that's hiding behind his image. But in the end he's just a big as a jerk as he was in the beginning, except with a couple more friends. But do you really think that they all stayed friends? There's no chance. All in all his character makes you think that the bad people in school are just trying to show off.Andrew-The average jock who is being pressured by his dad to do everything right. His character is a pretty cool though. He's probly the nicest guy out of the group besides Brian, but he is always hiding behind his dad. We think at the beginning of the movie that he loves playing his sports and being a jock, but we find out that he isn't what everyone thinks that he is. I think one cool thing in there was on his jacket it has a State championship patch on it. All the students were probly so proud of him and he was treated like a celebrity but inside he really didn't care. All in all his character makes you think that not everyone wants to go through the things the go through.Brian-The brain of the group. One of the nicest and kindest. He is pressured by his parents just like Andy but not for sports. He's pressured by his grades. We find out that he got an F in shop class and he can't take it. Some of the other kids think that is pretty dumb to hate yourself for failing shop. But the he might think that it's pretty dumb for Andy to hate himself because he didn't win his wrestling match. He is having a tough time dealing with his grades, parents, and getting ripped on by his other classmates, such as John. All in all his character makes you think that some kids have a tougher time and makes you think about treating people badly.Claire-She is probably my least favorite character. I mean I love Molly Ringwald but the character is a snob and is very conceited. She does have her normal teenage problems like everyone, but that's about it. I mean she's popular, she's not getting beaten by her dad, she's not being pressure by her dad, and she's not being ignored by her parents. She tries to get other people to feel sorry for her and thinks that she's the only one with problems. All in all her character is one who learns that other peolpe have different problems too.Allison-The basketcase. She doesn't talk for the first half of the movie and she starts talking after all the other kids are all high. She starts lying about all kinds of sexual themes and trying to get people to think that she's some crazy girl. We find out that she has a tough homelife, being ignored by her parents and find out that she's a good girl and just tries to get a rise out of people. One of my favorite parts of the movie is when she dumps her purse out on the couch. Andrew says 'At least I didn't dump my problems out on the couch!' That was likea cry for help, but she wasn't sure if she wanted it. All in in all her character makes you think what kind of people you never talk to at school could be. They could turn out to be one of your best friends.Well that's what I gotta say about the characters. I could've written more. Much more, but I don't think anyone would've read it. If you haven't seen this movie...you're missing out on your highschool days. It teaches you so much. You really do learn more from this than out of some book you have to learn for some school project.",Null,0,1,29 June 1999
