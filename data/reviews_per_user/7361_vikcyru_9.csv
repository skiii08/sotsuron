Iron Man 3," Best of the three Iron Man movies for me
",Loved watching this the second time from seeing it in the cinemas 7 years ago. Loved the panic attacks he faced as his character developed in an unexpected way. Loved him having to get by without the armour again. Loved the chemistry between Iron Man and the boy and many many comedic moments including the terrorist reveal. Robert Downey Junior made the avengers movies with his portrayl of iron man and I felt this was his finest performance,9,0,1,25 February 2020
Captain Marvel," Loved the soundtrack
",Not much else. Nick Fury with great character but this story line is one of the lamest for the most powerful character...,5,0,0,24 June 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Favourite movie in the series
","This is the funniest movie in the Avenger cinematic universe and I love Thor and Hulk so this is a classic. Great direction, great timing and some epic battles made this Thor Finale my favourite superhero film to date.",10,1,5,21 June 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Much better than the original
",I'm not a cap America fan but this one had some good plot twists and was essential viewing for the rest of the avengers. Love black widow and enjoyed the plot about control and spin. Much better than the first instalment,7,1,1,23 March 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," 1st sucker
",I love the avengers series in general but felt this movie - set first chronologically was one of the lamer offerings... I know they are super hero movies but very unbelievable as I couldn't grasp how a scrawny guy now with injected muscles can now run special ops missions with no training... And also some very unclear characters and waste of great actors in Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving.. overall once was more than enough,5,0,0,20 January 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Best movie in Avengers series?
","Look, part of it was the surprise factor. The one movie I wasn't pumped to see turned out to have the quirkiest most loveable characters, epic fight scenes and best humour. Great must see movie at the end of the day with a wicked soundtrack",9,0,1,29 March 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Best of Avengers movies
",The action was top class. The parties funny as. The chemistry between the characters awesome. And the final scene with the destruction of Sokovia epic. Loved it from start to finish and while there were many rah rah moments it's what you want from an action film.,9,0,0,13 April 2020
Black Panther," Liked it more the 2nd time
",Some deep themes I resonated and some great ones for world unity and the African cause. Felt like it remained genuine in its attempt to respect African cultures and had some amazing scenery and great special effects.,8,1,1,21 June 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Romantic comedy of the avengers
","I really enjoyed this chapter in the Thor films. Great to see character development in Locki, Natalie Portman slap heroes, comedic relief and big changes from Thor packed into some awesome action... maybe the weakest of the Thor series but I still enjoyed it",7,0,0,22 March 2020
