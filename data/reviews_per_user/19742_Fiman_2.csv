Skyfall," Too much of all the all the bad stuff, too little of fun
","Technically stunning, but it simply does not work as It used to do. Too many meaningless killings and the humor is totally absent. Everything is simply very serious, and I really missed all the funny small catchy scenes that has characterized former James Bond movies. I do not understand the psychology of the bad-ass villain, certainly not his 'homoerotic' appearance (apparently all his killings were not enough to make him sufficiently psychopathic). I usually love Badem and Dinch - but honestly here their acting is far from their usual standards. I guess I must blame the directing that has focused on shootings and explosions, and missed the story.",5,4,6,26 December 2016
Brokeback Mountain," A film that haunts you long after ...
","I have seen many films. Some did move me. But this film simple beats me off the ground. And it not only blow me away, it haunts me! Maybe because I am gay. Maybe because it describes hidden feelings and emotions I know too well myself. Maybe because the story is just so damn good and the performances so moving. Maybe because so many small tales are hidden in the acting and storyboard that you are not able to cope with them all until long after you leave the cinema. Small short sequences from the film repeatedly returns to me, and I still find new treasures in these memories. Such an experience for one ticket's price! Thank you to the director and the actors for a outstanding and absolutely brilliant experience.",10,14,16,1 January 2006
