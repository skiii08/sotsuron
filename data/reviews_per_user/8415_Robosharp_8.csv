It," IT starts exceptionally, but IT ends typically.
","I recall about 20 minutes into the re-boot of Stephen King's IT, thinking I'm in for a treat here. And to be fair 20 minutes later I was just as enthusiastic. These 40 minutes had showed me slick direction, suspenseful narrative, a good introduction to our new teenage heroes of Derry and of course above all a really excellent opening scene, presenting Pennywise the mysterious evil killer clown, or other wise know as IT.Lets face it, the driving force of both the book, the original TV series and now this film is the depiction of Pennywise himself (Itself). And here Bill Skarsgard and the special effects team do a stirling job on creating a menacing and fiendish bad guy entity.So with this in mind, should I not be giving this film a higher rating? No. Why? Well the film wasn't 40 mins long, it was over two hours. The first hour I was fully engage, the second hour my engagement waned. The scare sequences became more tedious, more CGI was replacing dread. And to be frank the actual story never causes much drama, and to be fair doesn't really make sense.Why does Pennywise kill all other children and teenagers at will, but just appears to muck about with the main cast? (he kills adults in the chapter 2) IT could surly kill them at any time, but instead IT lets them team up on him and all of a sudden he is powerless, and defeated far to easily. You never really feel any of these kids are actually in any danger from IT, it has that kinda of comic book feel, which dislodges the tension. Look appreciate that this is how the book was written, so can't entirely blame the film for that.The performances from the teenage cast are good here. Most notably would be Sophia Lillis who plays the rouge 'teenage girl with domestic issues', Beverly Marsh. A clear talent with great screen presence, but her character is most notable because she gets a lot more backstory than the others, and her characters journey gets shoved in your face to be honest. Due to this some of the other lads in the group end up getting overlooked and therefore unbalances the group dynamics.This is still a decent film, with a lot of positives. Well made, with an intriguing Killer clown at it's centre. Certainly worth checking out.",7,8,15,13 September 2017
John Wick," The definition of style over substance.
","The reason this review is like 5 years late is because my friend recently suggested we go see the the third instalment of the series, as the first two are so epic. I was like really?? He was like, yeah, oh my god, you gotta see John Wick! So now I have seen John Wick...Ok, the film starts off quite well. Immediately you sense a high standard in terms of production. Slick camera work, innovative editing, stunning lighting. Also the plot starts okay, we are introduced to John, seemingly normal decent guy, living a normal life with his puppy, mourning the loss of his recently deceased wife. Whilst minding his own business on a road trip, a few 'Russian' thugs like the look of his car and try to buy it off him. He rejects the offer, and drives away. Russian thugs really want this car, so they presumably follow him to his home. They then confront poor John in the middle of the night. Beat the crap out of him, and inexplicably kill his pet puppy in the process. Note that in this scene John comes across as quite vulnerable and practically defenceless against these thugs. If the thugs had of wanted to kill him, they really could have done. Instead they knock him out and leave with his car. John is left broken, and utterly distraught that his adored puppy has been taken from him. He wants revenge, and at this point we all want him to get revenge! But how is he going to go about? This man is no fighter, he can't physically take these thugs on, we've seen that all ready. He's gonna have to devise a plan, and he's gonna have to be brave. This could be good, my friend was right. WRONG..It turns out that John Wick is a super killer assassin. An invincible, unstoppable killing machine. They messed with the wrong guy! It also turns out that the rest of this film is steaming pile of cow pat...Queue John Wick killing hundreds and hundreds of practically innocent men in pursuit of his revenge. Okay I think amongst it all he does get the three original thugs, but you could miss it, seeing as he kills so many. And that is it, thats all this film is. Yes it's slick, hence not giving it 1 star, but it is shockingly immature.One last gripe, (equally as stupid as the fact that at the start of the film JW had his 'Steven Seagal' mode switched off), is how films think its only cool for 'heroes' to kill men. At one point in this dribble, a female assassin is going all out to kill John, as he has a two million $ bounty on his head. This woman, a professional assassin, and very dangerous will stop at nothing until John is dead, it is likely that she has killed many before. In a fight, John over powers her, and decides not to finish her off as she is a woman, despite the fact that she is only going to come back and try and kill him again. In contrast John kills many men that he really does not have too. Most not even posing a threat and had nothing to do with the killing of his puppy. In fact this female assassin goes on to kill one of John friends! But oh no, he can't kill a woman, thats not cool right??Wow. Not a big shock but I won't be watching the sequel or the third instalment. My friend and many others seem to lap up this garbage...",3,3,5,8 May 2019
Wind River," Would have preferred if it was just a wildlife documentary.
","Wind River is one of those films that many will really like and many won't like at all. Im in the latter.A very quick summary of the plot revolves around the discovered body of a murdered native young woman/girl in an Indian reservation. Out of towner female FBI agent Elizabeth Olsen turns up to solve the case with the help of the native law enforcement and also local tracker/ mad max-vigilante, Jeremy Renner.It starts off very promising and straight away we get a dose of Wyoming's beautiful snow capped land scales and feral wildlife - a real visual treat, but then unfortunately the so called murder investigation/plot starts.The main reason reason I didn't like this is because there was no murder investigation. Renner, who mumbles his way through the film, and Olsen kinda just move from one location to the next causing more harm than good. Olsen's character is supposed to be this rabbit in in the headlights turned tough cookie Clarice Starling alike and feminist alarm bells start ringing when she clashes with local authority and the natives over the murder and her ability to get it resolved. To be honest that doesn't bother me to much, but want did bother me was the morality side of the two lead characters.Both seem deeply troubled throughout by the death of the native girl who was found frozen and molested in the snow and walked 6 miles before falling to her death. Sure of course that is awful, but her death is the only one that counts, the numerous men that are killed in the process of their 'investigation' is of no importance at all. The scene that cements this the most is where Olsen's FBI agent knocks at the door of a potential suspect, he runs she chases they have a short stand off where she blasts him to death with a flurry of bullets from her gun. He did have a gun in his hand so could be perceived as self defence, but that isn't the major issue. The major issue is that it turns out he had nothing to do with the murder investigation, but its very much swept under the carpet. The very next scene Olsen is Jovially chatting with Renner on their next move, there is absolutely no signs from her that she just shot an individual to death, no emotions or anything, as though it did happen, what does she do this every day? Didn't sit well with that, seeing as this film is not a tongue in cheek actioner like Kick Ass.The silly shoot outs don't stop there as there a climatic one where 10 or so law enforcement agents are killed in a stand off where everybody dies except Olsen's tough brave and extremely lucky FBI agent who happened to be bang smack in the middle of it. She is helped by Renner who is sniping some of these bad guy cops from a distance. Thats right Renner who through most of the film is an ordinary local tracker has now turned into a psychopathic killer and vigilante, who dishes out mad max style justice on one one of the girls murderers when he catches him.OK I think you can tell i wasn't keen on there films plot and moral grounds, I also thought it lacked any drama as there was no real investigating, it was more action.I must say though the film is shot beautifully and has a compelling score. The best bits for me was the stunning scenery and interaction with wildlife in this remote part of the USA. Its a real pity the characters turned up!",5,2,6,3 December 2017
Bird Box," I actually really enjoyed this one.
","So I actually watched a film that retained my attention for the duration. This is now a rare occurrence in modern film for me, seeing as their all either comic book, star wars, pixar, remakes or boring biopics. This film had me gripped, I liked the predicament, and there is always a sense of urgency and threat. I also think the concept is pretty original, though I know there are some similar plot lines out there. Bullet point though, I liked it, had me engaged throughout...Low and behold, come on to IMDB and every bodies slagging it off. It's mad, just how subjective film is. The amount of crap I watch, where I expect IMDB reviewers to perform critical obliteration, and they end up loving it. Find a film that I actually enjoyed watching, and many don't like it, and I expected the rating to be higher!Well in my opinion this is a good watch. One of Netflix's most engaging original films.",8,0,3,14 January 2019
Resident Evil," jovovich flexes her muscles in popular gamer zombie flick
","I think the first thing to understand about Resident Evil, is that it is not a horror film, despite the title. It is closer to a sci-fi action genre, which, to its credit, is reflective of its game origin.This movie, though it does have some scary moments (it of course involves zombies), is more a zombie mash-up, as the central characters smash their way through the vast hoard of the undead, which inhabit the Scientific laboratory which is know as the hive.The movie centres around the character of Alice (Milla Jovovich), who appears to be some kind of special ops soldier, but has a spate of amnesia, so only begins to realise this, once she has kicked some zombie ass. Alice seems to be equipped with some top-notch fighting skills and great Physical strength to match. She is joined by an 'elite' military unit, which includes a Michelle Rodriguez, who plays a tough-nut military chick, but who actually spends the majority of the film with a permanent grimace, and kinda grant outs her predictable lines.But that doesn't matter, because this is Jovovich's ride, and she does glow, throwing great energy into the role. She just seems perfect to play the ass-kicking heroine Alice, with her striking looks and killer body to fit. The male fans will be particularly pleased with the Alice Attire, which includes the short mini skirt, giving Jovovich the opportunity to parade her long dazzling, lean legs through out. She also demonstrates their strength, with a variety of bone crunching kicks and stamps. She even unleashes the devastating muscle of her inner thighs, on one unsuspecting zombie, rapidly crushing his neck, with their brutal force.So with Jovovich proving to be a real hit, this will provide an enjoyable experience to watch, and remains the best film in the franchise.",7,3,4,1 January 2013
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A real mixed bag, this one...
","Tremendous style, cinematography and acting, but ultimately, I was bored.Engagement or the act of engaging the audience, is a film's number one objective, and I don't believe Tarantino's latest film does too well on that front. There will be people who disagree and state that this film is a 10/10 masterpiece, but for me, that is ridiculous. The MANY will likely find this film too long, pretentious and have an insufferable plot with a number of random scenes and characters that ultimately have little to do with the conclusion.On the flip side, all the scenes are separately engaging, as of course are 'Tarantino-esque '. Also Dicaprio and Pitt are great throughout. And 1960's Hollywood is captured magnificently. But it just didn't add up very well for me.Also the very OTT violence at the end. It feels like Quentin suddenly realised his story was lacking bloodshed, so pencilled in as much brutality as he could in the final ten minutes. Yes it's tongue in cheek and meant to be comic, but it is also very, very violent and inflicted on young women. This violence, perpetrated by Pitt's and Dicaprio's characters, also did not add up or make sense based on their behaviours through the earlier film.",6,2,3,15 August 2019
Get Out," Decent, but disappointing given the hype
","It would be wrong to say that this is not a good film, unfortunately one that has been over hyped. If I had watched it without knowing the hype and rave reviews, it would likely have earned an extra star rating.No need to discuss the plot but the film sits in the mystery/horror genre slot. I thought it was a comedy-horror going in, but it isn't. In fact the undertone to the film has quite a dark and socially challenging agenda.Though is the film a new fresh take on the horror genre as some reviews have suggested, well, erm, no. All though there is some astute direction in building the suspense, Get Out does end up following the standard horror narrative. The last 25 minutes is particularly typical as our central character desperately tries to 'get out' of the bad situation.Would still recommend watching this film, just don't get too excited.",6,7,15,4 July 2017
It Chapter Two," Shhhh IT Chapter 2
","SIGH from me.If Im gonna be honest, my hopes weren't high. I liked elements of the first film, but thought overall it was flawed. So did I go into this one with negative eyes, perhaps, but I really did give it a clean slate, hoping that it would better its predecessor. Was it? Nope. It was way worse.This one doesn't even start well for me. Zero suspense for Pennywise's return. No story for the adult loser club members re the realisation that IT has returned. No pace or suspense at all, this one goes at comic book pace, which is particular disengaging given that the film is an unjustifiable 3 hours long!It is literally 3 hours of OTT, CGI sequences, with wholly unscary IT ghosts and monsters, that just like the first film, stalk the loser club, and again, just like the first, Pennywise never kills them, even though he could easily.
Mr King, why is that? Why can Pennywise only kill the b characters? Why does he always wait for the loser club to find away to defeat him, when he like has million occasions to kill them? Bit silly that from the clown, then again BIT SILLY would kinda summed up the review in two words.",4,3,7,8 September 2019
