The King's Speech," Better Dramas Are Hard to Find.
","Winner of four Oscars, The King's Speech is the best pure drama of the past four years. The acting is superb and genuine, giving the audience a peak into the life and pressures of King George VI. Collin Firth's human and down to earth portrayal of royalty gives the film a human quality which is hard to find in period films similar to this one. Firth's venerability, is what truly sets it apart. Geoffrey Rush delivers the performance of his lifetime.The Cinematographic originality also gives the film a unique, yet classic heir to it. Tom Hooper paints a straightforward story, in a somewhat old- fashioned style, without any gimmicks or tricks and nails it. For those of you who haven't yet seen this masterpiece, I recommend it go straight to the top of your bucket list.",10,1,2,22 June 2012
