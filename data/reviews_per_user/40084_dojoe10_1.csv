The Incredible Hulk," A much better Hulk!!!
","Let me rephrase that. A much, much better Hulk. I just saw a sneak preview and the movie is awesome! This one has less drama than its predecessor. The CG effects for the Hulk itself look ten times better than before. This movie plays much better with the effects in combination with the director's style. He makes full use of shadows in revealing when he wants to, not before.This movie did not look like a comic book. That is something that Ang Lee thought would work, even though many other successful comic book movies were made to look like movies. That's my stab at the way Mr. Lee made Hulk.This one came out much better. Get ready for more!",9,3,16,12 June 2008
