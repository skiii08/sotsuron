10 Cloverfield Lane," If It Wasn't For the Ending... Masterpiece.
","10 Cloverfield Lane was an outstanding piece of work, great directorial debut, it is actually hard to believe that is his first film. It was so methodical, and structured with key elements and plot points that were necessary for the film's advancement without clichÃ©s. I can see now why critics were saying this movie was a bit reminiscent of Hitchcock films. Side note, you would only know what they (critics) meant, if you actually watched more than just Psycho, Vertigo, or Birds.I truly did not expect to like the film as much as did... I do say like, however, as opposed to love because of the film's ending. 10 Cloverfield Lane's buildup is absolutely phenomenal, but after the lead actress escapes the clutches of the crazed kidnapper, the conclusion feels outrageously out of place, out of tune, and really just didn't flow well with the rest of the film. Even Winstead's character has a moment of negative disbelief 'Come On.' Now, this being the supposed sequel to CLOVERFIELD (2009) I expected it to be absolutely awful because the first film was found footage. Cloverfield (2009), if it had utilized great cinematography the way this film did, that movie could have possibly been a spectacle for the monster movie genre, or just much better than it was, in my opinion, but I absolutely detest shaky cam and even more-so found footage films. Also, the first film contained mostly improvisation from the main characters, whereas this one had a very solid script, that gave a depth to each character, rather than just 'OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!' and the annoying incessant shrieking of the woman in the first film 'JASON! JASON! JASON!' UGH! This sequel is a huge step up in quality overall.Even though the film had a bad moment, the negative aspect of this film cannot compare to everything it did right. The acting was a marvel to behold, I can see why Mary Elizabeth Winstead was the first and only choice for this film, I could not see anyone else playing her character better than she did. Same goes for Jon Goodman. Emmett's character could've been written a bit better but otherwise, solid casting. Also, the small cast worked so well because of the first one's need to give the viewers a scope of the destruction through the first person point of view whereas this one focuses more on the aftermath of the first film while also adding to it, in an unconventional way. I can easily say that this is going to be another film I can add to my favorites, and I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for something good to watch.",7,0,2,27 March 2016
Iron Man 3," Are All Superhero Movies Resorting to Comedy to Keep Themselves Afloat?
","I have to repeat the title because it's the sad truth... are the heroic movies resorting to comedy to lengthen its entirety in hopes of keeping the story 'interesting?' Where are the serious action films? This film was less than entertaining from the music choice in the beginning to the way the criminals lacked conviction to do anything actually menacing. So let me start with the pathetic criminal 'mastermind' in this movie... Guy Pearce can only do so much to the point where his performance is actually nauseating. I couldn't even believe this movie was being serious with the idea of creating a man who fueled himself revenge due to the fact the world's most sought after billionaire didn't meet him on the roof to discuss an important matter, this is complete and utter childishness. He couldn't schedule to meet with Mr. Stark later on. Once again, the convenience of the film's sieging of an opportunity towards elaborating on a plot that died the moment they involved revenge was utterly pathetic, and the fact that this movie made 1.2 billion dollars makes me question whether people care anymore towards whether or not their money goes towards something beautiful; which this movie was far from. I couldn't stand any of the characters in this movie because the script was non-engaging, almost every five minutes there was a giggle joke intervening the concept of the story so by the time the movie was over it comes off more as a comedy more than an a film to be taken as a serious installment towards the Avengers II. Which is why the first Iron Man, will always be the best out of the franchise no matter how many more films there are in the coming years involving Tony Stark. If this is the best they had to offer after three years for Iron Man then this franchise can go nowhere but down.",5,1,3,27 July 2013
The Impossible," Incredible, Astonishing, Amazing!
","This is a movie that will most definitely become an instant classic, I have watched this five times, and this is a movie that I will never forget. The harrowing emotional roller-coaster this movie portrays a family that is devastated by a tragedy that splits them apart, and only fate brought them back together. If you are squeamish however this movie is not for those who are. From beginning to end, the movie is intense and pushes you inevitably to the edge of your seat. It is impossible to hold back tears from the moment the water hits until the movie ends... for a moment it's almost impossible to say that this is a movie because of just how surreal the emotion of it all really is. Anyone looking for a great film, I would recommend this 9 times out of 10.",10,1,3,19 April 2013
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," There Is No Way This A Marvel Movie!
","There is no possible way that this is a Marvel movie. I am as baffled now as I was while sitting in that creaky theatre seat. I can say that this movie has given me hope for the Marvel movies to come, mostly from the directors who created this delightful and marvelous masterpiece. I feel as though I repeat myself in these reviews but the truth is the truth. This movie and I think those who saw it will agree, say the same thing or something close to it, this movie was a surprise! A surprise that surpassed my thoughts of how great a surprise could be.The intensity and high tension of the action sequences equally balanced with the well shot and perfectly paced character development was incredible to say the least... there's that word again... incredible, but in fact that is what this movie was. Nick Fury has a staged death scene, that elicited the enraged reaction of people around me, myself included. The revelation of Falcon which needless to say couldn't have been casted any better (loved the character from the beginning), even though I saw the same actor in Pain and Gain which was not all too great a movie, but I cannot judge because in the past Chris Evans had been portraying one dimensional characters like Johnny in Fantastic Four, which was cringe-worthy. Now that I stray farther from the subject I will say this... if you have been let down by the movies that have come out thus far this year, NOAH, DIVERGENT(being the worse) Mr. Peabody and whatever the hell else, GO SEE THIS MOVIE, DON'T PUT IT OFF, BECAUSE THIS A MOVIE TRULY WORTH THE MONEY.",8,1,2,13 April 2014
American Hustle," A Film that Brings Back Class To The Big Screen!
","Finally!! A classy picture for those tired of watching up-to-date modern garbage. This movie is for those wanting a classic feel of a movie that actually contains human emotion. I enjoyed this film so much, I've already seen it seven times, and counting because I plan to watch it again very soon. This movie made me feel as if I were thrown back into the old days.The Cons: Okay so the only thing that bothered me about the film were some of the bribery scenes, they seemed very forced, very awkward to watch, just a little thing in the beginning of the film when he moves the case towards Carmine (Jeremy Renner), other than that there was really nothing wrong with it at all.The pros:The script is beyond engaging and entertaining making the characters all the more intriguing to watch, the colors are very beautiful, the cinematic value even better. The person who made this movie truly respects what movies used to be and meant, it really does tell a story. No matter how lost you feel in this movie when you first watch, there will always be something you missed when you watch it again. It is witty, and again, I say this again because it is the truth, it is a classy film, it doesn't make you feel like you just watched recycled material from the oldies, it is a movie all its own, creative and original.The characters, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence starring in another movie is FILM GOLD! You cannot go wrong with a film starring either of these, especially Jennifer Lawrence, who is an important presence in films at the moment. Christian Bale plays a con artist who tricks the desperate into falling towards pointless loans with an outrageous advance price of $5000. 'I give 5, you give 50, right?' He gets caught up in a scheme plotted by another desperate FBI agent (the film revolves around the desperate, because they are easy to be tricked, (you give them all the power, they become yours to mold) hence the ending, where the con artists con the very man who hired them to take down big names in politics. The stories in between and the drama are just to add to the atmosphere of the seventies, which is incredibly written and beautifully executed. This film is very poetic, (the story of survival is one that never dies) and if you are an avid lover of film, you will not pass this movie up, because I guarantee there will be something you loved about it.",10,1,3,20 May 2014
Divergent," The truth about movies like this one...
","If this is truly based off a book, then God help those who actually thought this movie was good. Personally I have not read the books, although from what I saw in this movie, I am glad I never have. What kind of movie is this anyway? There was nothing pinnacle about this movie, nothing iconic, nothing that caused me to want to get up out of my seat and scream at the top of my lungs that was incredible because its all been done before. The army being controlled for God's sake was a pathetic attempt at being the slightest bit menacing, if menacing was what they were going for, it was pathetic. Then don't even get me started on the point where Tris gets to Kate Winslet, seriously!! No security to guard the most important person in the whole movie, the person who was behind the taking over of ABNIGATION, seriously?! Okay. There was barely any character development in any of the other characters except for Tris and Four and even that was done poorly (the revelation that the father beat Four when he was younger, if the movie really wanted fear to be felt, my God they failed). This movie SCREAMED young adult book, but then again the Hunger Games was a young adult trilogy, and all I could do was cover my mouth and hope the characters didn't die, and I know there is a part one and two coming out soon. This movie left no cliffhanger, nothing to the imagination, nothing to make a person ponder positively over what they just saw, it just happened to happen. There was nothing that dazzled and that is something I am noticing in most movies coming out these past few years. There isn't an elaborately put together story, its just put together in the way that's most clear to its audience, it is almost as if creators of movies nowadays don't want a thinking audience. AND THAT IS SAD, as sad as this movie was. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, due to its soggy and cringe-worthy script, poorly placed emotion, and over-told story. Thank God I got Game of Thrones, the Hunger Games, and Marvel movies to save me from movies like this. Seriously folks do not waste your money on this movie! I am giving this movie a five out of ten due to the fact that it tried, but it wasn't anywhere near as great as it could've been.",1,62,104,29 March 2014
Jack Reacher," Can Tom Cruise get any better?
","Tom Cruise... Like all his other movies manages to create a character that gives the sense that originality still exists. Although he gives the sense of the know-it-all guy that plans to save the damsel in distress, he does so through justification. If there's one thing I know about Tom Cruise, it's that he gives more than a hundred percent for each character he portrays. This movie is gripping from beginning to end and is one crazy fun filled ride that is sure to capture your attention once the beginning credits start to roll. The idea of conspiracy is a story that will never cease to amaze as long as it is executed properly and this movie does just that, along with the help of cinematography to reel you into a story that is sure to delight even those who thought they never would've liked it to begin with. For me, it is impossible to hate a Tom Cruise film. Now that aside, the movie is definite must watch and I would recommend this film 10 times out of 10.",7,4,10,18 May 2013
Les Misérables," Honestly...
","This is what people love more than the 1998 masterpiece that is Les Miserables. This movie was terrible, the story sure was OK, but movies are meant to amaze, and this movie did the complete opposite. The only thing beautiful about this movie was the trailer, because at least the trailer had emotion... not once did I feel anything for the characters, not even Fantine when she died. The movie didn't have a real character development, just like songs from now the story lacked meaning. There was no true beauty it was just a long and overdone song. Another thing, could this movie have picked a worst singing cast, Anne Hathaway was amazing, but Russell Crow, I couldn't even watch the movie to the end because of his putrid singing (if that's singing is). I would recommend this movie only to those who like wasting their time.",6,0,1,18 May 2013
Joker," Speechless...
","If you get the chance, go ahead and watch this in theaters because that is the way this movie is meant to be seen. A standalone film with a take on the Joker that is not superhuman or invincible, but rather, vulnerable, fragile, what every man must probably look like before becoming a villain. This gave the audience a sequence of events that seamlessly tie together this man's descent into madness. The craziest thing about the movie is that I am sure it would be just as good if it were about a regular guy and not about the joker.Absolute quality across the board, cinematography, scoring, performances, overall plot was intoxicating to experience. This definitely is my favorite movie of the year... quite possibly the past few years too. Granted it was violent although it wasn't gratuitous... and some people complain that it was, but I am not sure they know what gratuitous means because the kills were psychologically tied to the character or due to provocation.SPOILERS *********** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN
The first time the joker kills its because three men are attacking him on a subway for interrupting their harassment of a lady on a subway with his laugh- attack. The second kill is of Arthur's adoptive mother, who before killing her found out that she was dating a man who abused Arthur so severely that it caused his neurological condition that prevents him from stopping random laugh attacks... he resents her extremely for the lies, and the abuse. The third kill happens much later in the film when a character named Randall tries to get Arthur to talk about the gun because cops are questioning him, Arthur is still upset over the fact that this guy cost him his job so he kills him in front a dwarf who he could've killed but doesn't because this particular person did nothing to wrong him. The last kill of the film is the absolutely the most shocking in which he knows Robert De Niro brought him on the show to use and ridicule him in front of the nation on camera for not being funny, and he exposes the truth of the world he experiences daily to the audience and then shortly shoots Robert De Niro's character... gratuitous, not at all... gratuitous is something that is unnecessary, that is not the case at all in this film. I can honestly say this movie was not I was expecting, and I am 100% okay with that.",9,0,2,14 October 2019
The Conjuring," An Exquisite Horror Masterpiece! I mean it... it's a MASTERPIECE!
","Ingenuity is a word that has sort of strayed away from the horror genre and I have to say The Conjuring gives me hope. In my opinion James Wan has created a masterpiece. This movie is genius in its construction, the way it was devised from the moment it begins towards the second the credits begin to roll at the end. It was well paced, intricately and elaborately shot (upside down shot of Christine who thinks she sees a man by the door), and I mean seriously incredibly shot. This movie honestly gave me the feel of a seventies classic, if you've seen Carrie, A Nightmare on Elm Street, or Suspiria then you'd understand what I mean. The plot is well constructed, you have the move in, the occurrences of ghosts, the search for a plausible explanation, then the search for the help that inevitably ends up being ghost hunters with a past of an exorcism gone wrong <-- Which by the way was perfect for an internal character conflict because I don't think it's been done since the Exorcist 1973 and that horrible conflict happened at the end when the priest died. All of the incidents with the entities were original and were never seen coming, at all, complete and under jump scares that were actually scary. The fact that the movie was given it's rated R on the sole fact of horror is incredible. If you are looking for a movie worth watching, honestly and sincerely watch this, it's more than worth the money because it is actually terrifying! It's not a cheap knock off horror/comedy like Cabin in the Woods.",8,0,2,27 July 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the many Movies That Will Never Die
","I've seen almost every classic iconic horror movie that most people find to be terrifying. But this is the one movie that blows all other horror icons out of the water, there is no way anyone can say the first Freddie film isn't scary. Wish I could say the same for the other Freddie knock- offs but I won't because they all were TERRIFYINGLY AWFUL. What in God's name is more terrifying than a man who invades your dreams and can kill you if he gets to you in them? The answer is there isn't anything more terrifying, that's why this is one the best horror films ever to have hit the big screen. I saw this movie when I was 13... even now I'm still terrified of the whole concept of a dream invader. Anyone looking for a horror movie that will honestly terrify you, watch this, lights out, speakers full blast, see if you don't freak out when you're by yourself.",10,2,2,18 May 2013
Joy," Honestly...
","This film contains a very powerful message but is weighed down by its uninteresting script and poorly placed cast.Jennifer Lawrence does the best she can with the script she is given. Acting from her part, as with Silver Linings is very top notch, could not complain, gaining empathy and love from the audience is what she does best, that is just a given. But something is missing that most David O' Russell films contain... and that is the chemistry within characters... what I mean by that, is that even though problems arise and people are placed in those situations, the character dialogue is very forced, and out of place, family drama is arisen for situation complication yet it all feels very unnecessary and sometimes exceedingly awkward. What worked for Silver Linings Playbook, and American Hustle with dysfunction lacks here because of its very mild PG-13 vibe. I strongly believe that the film's possibilities were very limited due to its PG-13 rating kind of the way I Heart Huckabees was. Dialogue and character development could have been better exemplified if it had gone for an R rating, that is just the way I feel.That being said though, the film's message of perseverance is enough to make this movie somewhat enjoyable. But nonetheless, it will probably be as easily forgotten as it was easily watched. It is very disappointing given that David O' Russell's craft lies in character development and I had my expectations quite high, regardless of reviews.",6,0,0,2 August 2016
