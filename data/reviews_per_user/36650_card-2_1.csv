Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Menace a Worthy Successor to Star Wars
","George Lucas has done it again.  The Phantom Menace is a slick adventure movie which engages the viewer on different levels.The action sequences in the film are nothing less than spectacular.  The pod race plays like a top flight Disney attraction.  During this scene, you are transported beyond the confines of the movie theater.Lightsaber duelling has never been like this!  The climactic battle pitting the Jedi knights against Darth Maul is the most dynamic, intense part of the movie.Plots have never been the strong point of Star Wars films.  However, the story in The Phantom Menace is actually more sophisticated than in the prior 3 films; of particular interest is the political intrigue involving the Senator Palpatine.  Despite criticisms to the contrary, the elaborate plot helps make the movie more than just a kids film.Liam Neeson turns in a good performance as a stoic Jedi; Obi Wan Kenobi is effectively portrayed, right down the inflection of  the voice.  It was like watching a younger Alec Guinness.The cons?  Jake Lloyd is wooden as Anakin Skywalker and the dialogue is awkward.  Also, Jar Jar is arguably the most annoying creature in Star Wars history.Overall, a worthy addition the Star Wars canon.",8,0,0,27 May 1999
