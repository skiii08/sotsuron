Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A all new kind of comedy!
","I think that the persons who have low rated this film are just as stuck up than the idiots that Borat interview during the film. In fact, this movie is a brand new kind of comedy and, i am deeply surprised, to see that people are criticizing Sacha Cohen as being offensive against Jews when he actually IS Jew! Anyway, people only can love the movie cause everything inside is kind of REAL.. i am not sure that in some occasions the reports weren't fixed at some level but its obvious that the great majority is 100% genuine.I approve this movie and i have rated it 10 *. I usually HATE US comedies and i despise the kind of Jim Carey movies that fill theater's because is simply STUPID and boring. I gave up trying to laugh on theaters for some years now but, when i started to see the movie, i could contain myself.The character BORAT is deeply offensive, racist, incestuous etc. but he does it with such a naturally that the common person will not be too much hurt with the things he say.I ensure you that this movie is the first of his kind so you cannot loose the opportunity to see him. A great piece of satire on American Society and a opportunity to look at the cultural differences between the people of the same country!",10,2,15,17 December 2006
