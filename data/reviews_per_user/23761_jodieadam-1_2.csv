Hereditary," Boring, boring boring, 5 minutes of the Exorcist, really stupid and predictable ending
","What a waste of time. I haven't been this disappointed with a horror film since the Witch. Literally just a family adjusting to the death of a child in an accident for over an hour with the occasional ghost standing in the corner. 
Then five minutes of Exorcist style horror scenes and a really stupid and predictable finale. 
Basically, the same story as Skeleton Key but not nearly done as well.",1,1,6,7 October 2018
The Purge," Don't bother - watch the 1971 Straw Dogs instead
","This would have been an amazing film if it had been made in 1971, and starred Dustin Hoffman and it had been called Straw Dogs. O wait that film already exists doesn't it?The initial premise is an interesting social commentary, but after tricking you in the film only briefly touches on that idea. Instead it retells to same old tired king of the castle story which has been done better so many times before. Save yourself the night of boredom and watch Straw Dogs instead (the Sam Peckinpah version obviously), it doesn't rely on an absurd future and you actually have some vested interest in the characters.",1,1,2,24 November 2013
