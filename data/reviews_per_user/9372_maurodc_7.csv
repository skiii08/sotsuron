Hereditary," Acting wasn't the best, but disturbing nonetheless
","When this movie came out, a friend told me that she had already seen it and that it was a total piece of crap, which is something that I couldn't believe at all as it has really good ratings by critics and the people too (probably one of the best grades I've seen in a 21st century horror movie). So, I went to see it for finding out which was the damn reality about this movie and why there was a huge amount of people that saw this as a nightmarish masterpiece and some other guys that thought this was garbage.And the truth is that it is neither one thing or the other. It is complex, nightmarish and highly disturbing to watch, mostly at the end, and it has sort of an old fashioned style comparable to horror cult classics like 'Rosemary's Baby'. But still, it is no masterpiece.First of all, I had a very big trouble with the acting. In my opinion, it was really exagerated at lots of scenes, particularily Toni Collette and sometimes Alex Wolff too. Probably it Is because their direction wasn't the best or because there were dialogues of the script that weren't helpful, or they just didn't made a great acting job that this movie needed to have.Still, I recommend this movie because of the creepy soundtrack, the very good and faded photography and its really horrifying atmosphere and feeling that leaves you when the credits start rolling. If you like to feel frightened by a movie at the cinema, this is it. Just don't expect Oscar worthy performances from it.Thanks for reading!",7,0,1,14 July 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Surprisingly good!
","A few years ago when I found out that the Spider-Man saga was going to be restarted again, I was like: 'Nooooooooo why? Garfield was awesome!'I always loved the Spider-Man's trilogy (the ones with Tobey Maguire) since I was 4, and they're still special for me; the ones with Andrew Garfield were as amazing as the titles.And then we have Tom Holland...well, when I first saw him performing Peter Parker/Spider-Man in 'Captain America: Civil War', I was judging him all the time, because I found him like very stupid and irritating for being Spider-Man. And, of course, I first considered him as a giant insult for its predecessors.But then 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' arrived and the only motive I had to go and see it was my eternal faithfulness to Marvel and its movies, but that was it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered on buying a ticket for it.And I was almost completely wrong.I was surprised of how good and hilarious was the job of Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Although before this movie I always saw him stupid, I realized that, after all, Peter Parker was still a boy, and that's what Tom was in here, and something that the other Spider-Man movies lacked.Michael Keaton was excellent as the vulture (what can I say? He always does an excellent job), and I think that everyone in the cast did a great job, even Marisa Tomei as Aunt May (despite the fact that she was a bit young for that role, but it was find).The only character that I thought that was completely awful was Flash Thompson. He was a big guy who enjoys to bully everyone who is smaller than him, not a stupid and annoying geek who made look Peter as the bully. And there's other character that at first you will love, but then when she made a brief reference to a character, you will hate...you guys when you see the movie will know who am I talking about.In conclusion, all the action was good, it has nice jokes and well, it is always nice to see Mr. Downey Jr. and, of course, the always important special appearance of Stan Lee.Thanks for reading!",8,15,28,8 July 2017
Baby Driver," The best action movie in years!
","'Baby Driver' is a perfect example of how good an action movie can be if it's original, hilarious, exciting and well done. I waited months to see it as it was the first time I saw Ansel Elgort in an action flick.And also because in general, the whole cast not only looked awesome at trailer and the poster, but everyone actually did a great job at the movie: Ansel was just perfect and irresistibly funny at his leading role; I freaking fell in love with the character of Lily James, and with how perfect Ansel and her looked together; Mr. Spacey was excellent too; Mr Foxx and Mr. Hamm were simply hateful, which was a good thing. And it was good to me to see Eiza Gonz√°lez in a more serious role than in all the things she did before.And the music, oh my God the music was just excellent. Every song was very well selected and perfectly fit in every single minute of the movie. It gave to it the whole atmosphere it had to have. This will probably make you doubt about the time context of the story, which you will totally enjoy.10/10. As an action movie is simply perfect and exciting, I totally recommend it to you. I already saw it three times at the cinema, and believe me, even if you don't like action movies, this one is going to impress you. In a few years it will be probably considered an action classic.Thanks for reading!P.S. And teens, I'm very happy to say that you can perfectly see this one with your parents as it doesn't have very much graphic violence, and it has no coarse language in a sexual context or any sexual scenes. And it is also an excellent choice to see with your girlfriend.",10,1,8,9 September 2017
Dunkirk," It started off very slowly, but at the end worth it.
","Honestly, at first, I didn't wanted to see this movie very much because when I saw that it was rated PG-13, all the interest that the trailer gave to me about it was gone. Why? Because that probably would cause that the movie lack in realistic and bloody battles that are present probably in most of the war films. But however, I left my bloody standards for a while and went to see 'Dunkirk' yesterday.The very beginning of it is very suspenseful and makes you to get interested in what is going to happen. But then the movie becomes a little slow and boring (I must admit it, I was sleeping a bit). But anyway, the great cinematography, the point of view which is different from the others of the genre, the descent performances and the whole second half of it made the stressful experience worthwhile. Definitely worthy of the IMAX.Thanks!",8,0,6,6 August 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Whatever it takes...
","Hello again everyone! It's been almost a month since thousands of Marvel fans (including myself) got to see the one and only Endgame for the very first time, without having a clue of what could possibly happen. And as with most of the people who already watched it...there are no words to describe how this amazingly crafted piece of superhero movie-making just...blew me away.I will start by giving its credit to the acting work of everyone. When we appreciate that, we can see that this isn't just another sci-fi flick where no one does exactly a great effort to make a remarkable performance. No. This is a movie that presents us a group of heroes that, after long years of saving the earth from any menace, are giving the last of themselves in order to give the planet one last shot. The performances made it all seem authentic and real.Now, the story. God. The story is many things. Sometimes it's funny, as any other of the previous movies from the MCU. But also it's deep, melancholic, tragic, and most of all, undeniably exciting.10/10. Probably most of the people that will read this had already watched it. But in case you haven't, you really, REALLY ought to do so. Probably during quite a few years, there will be no other film of the genre that can possibly make you feel all of the emotions that Avengers Endgame made the audiences feel, and made me feel. Don't miss it for anythingPeace!",10,4,7,17 May 2019
Brave," Great and completely worthy of the Oscar
","I saw Brave today at the cinema on a special screening of the movie. I had already seen it before but I am doing the review now because in those times I hadn't an IMDb account. But anyway, here it is:'Brave'it's excellent and one of the bests of Disney in recent years, if not the best. When I first saw it I completely regretted all the negative comments I said about it before even seeing it (I wanted Wreck-it Ralph to win).It has an excellent story and character development of the protagonists. I loved the character of Merida, as well as her parents, her brothers and probably everyone else too. The script doesn't stop being funny lighthearted and perfectly well done.Highly recommended to everyone, not just Disney fans (my father loved it and he doesn't usually see animated movies). Probably almost everyone has seen this movie much time ago, but in case you haven't, this will be completely useful for you.Thanks for reading!",10,0,1,21 July 2017
Incredibles 2," I've waited 14 years for this
","I was around 4 years old when 'The Incredibles' came out at the theaters, and during those times I didn't get tired of watching it over and over again. A few years later, I knew that there was going to be a sequel, but not the day or the year it was going to come out. And finally, after 14 long years, we have 'Incredibles 2'. And here's what I think.Obviously I liked the first one much more, but still, this is a really good sequel. It has moments that are exciting and completely hilarious. It's very joyful to see this characters again on the big screen, including Jack-Jack (I know you will love him). It has interesting confflicts and, I won't spoil you anything, but it's very funny to see Bob Parr's parental side.So, It may not be as epic as you'd expect it to be, but however, the excitement of the action sequences and the charm of all the characters keeps intact. Perfectly enjoyable and funny for the whole family.Thanks for reading!",9,14,27,16 July 2018
