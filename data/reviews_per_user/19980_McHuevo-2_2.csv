The Blair Witch Project," Couldn't sleep at night...
","I was curious about the movie because I've heard so many positive and negative comments about it. So me and a friend went to see it at 11:00 PM. I have to tell you, it was hard to sleep that night.I'd say The Blair Witch Project is not a movie, not like the ones we're used to. Is a whole new way to tell a scary story. And that new way got to my nerves.From the comments of other people I've deduced that you must fulfill two requisites for the movie to scare you: a) You must be an 8 mm video fan, and b) You must have had some kind of frightening experience at night. That way, the movie brings back all those emotions and makes you be afraid of the dark again.This was one scary movie.... for me at least.",Null,0,1,4 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Only for SW fans
","One week from it's opening I've seen this movie four times. I was a little bit nervous in the theatre because of the critics I had heard talking crap about The phantom menace, but at the end I wasn't disappointed, not a bit.Perhaps the reason why some people loved it and some hated it, is that this movie is made only for Star Wars fans, and I mean real fans. We got the movie from beginning to end. We understood the purpose of the story: to set things for Episode II and III. A story that could've been told in 20 minutes? So was A new hope! It is the first act of three. Do you go to a play expecting to see the whole story in the first 20 minutes? Of course not! I've never heard someone say 'Oh, what a disappointment of first act, they should've skipped right to the second' when he's going out of a play. This sounds ridiculous.Face it people: you would've loved The phantom menace had it been the first Star Wars movie and hated A new hope had it been released this year. It's that simple.I've read other comments on The phantom menace and I can say the same: you want a story that can be told in a single-movie? go see Casablanca or Gone with the wind or who-knows what. I'm seeing Episode 1 six times again because this is when I have the chance to experience it in a theatre the way it's meant to be.So this goes for all of you critics: do you want to enjoy The phantom menace as the movie it is? It doesn't take  only to see Episodes IV, V and VI; read other Star Wars stories, take a look at the comics, get a little more information of this huge universe that was born in 1977! Oh, what am I saying... please leave the seats for someone who will appreciate a great film.",10,0,0,7 July 1999
