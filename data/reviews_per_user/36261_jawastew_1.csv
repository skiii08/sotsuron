Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My opinion
","First of all no movie series has changed the movies like Star Wars. Second everyone i know criticize this movie as childish, boring, poorly directed, and bad acting. Well i also seem to remember how everyone went to see it several times and how most of you probably own it. It still today has one of the absolute greatest lightsabre battle. Let forget that Jar-Jar was in the movie, then what do you have to criticize, sure the boy was only OK but this was a role any Star Wars fan would have taken and still would knowing what people think of it. You know that you loved the lightsabre battle at the end and how you drooled as the new generation of special effects was brought in yet again as Jedi battled of against evil when you first saw The Destroyer Droids. Seriously this movie was judged mainly on what others have said. Just think about when you watched it for the first time. Before you heard others' opions, you know you loved it. -Hope this was useful -may the force be with you -always",8,5,7,30 June 2006
