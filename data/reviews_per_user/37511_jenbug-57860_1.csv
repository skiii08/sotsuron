It," Best horror movie yet!!
","I usually don't write reviews on movies, but after seeing this movie, I just had to. This has got to be the best horror movie that I have seen in awhile. It had a great story, was not predictable, very suspenseful, was on the edge of my seat the entire time. It was scary but not too scary. I would definitely watch it again and again and again. 10X better than the original which was extremely long and boring. Brilliant movie!!! Loved it!!!",10,4,10,12 September 2017
