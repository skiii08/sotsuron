Captain Phillips," Breathtaking !!! A MUST MUST WATCH !
","It's all about survival ! Somalian Pirates attack a US Cargo ship ! Then how the captain handles it ? Whether the Crews & captain survive or not ! Even if survives, HOW !!!?? To know that, 2hrs & 15mins went like lightnings for me !Based on the true story of Real Captain Phillips, from his book: A Captain's Duty﻿.From the director of Bourne Ultimatum, who makes sure the movie doesn't lose its pace﻿ & Starring Tom Hanks, who did stand out like always﻿ ! The supporting actors deserve a distinction as well.So, I am going for Straight 9 ! Again saying, A Must Must watch!",9,2,4,16 January 2014
