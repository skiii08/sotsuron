It," Beautiful!
","I've been scared,I laughed,I was nervous.... and I thought it was brilliant! I even dare to say that it was better than the IT from 1990's. The characters were so good and funny(especially Richie). Bill Skarsg√•rd who played Pennywise did an amazing job and I was actually scared by his role. The little detail that caught my eye was slobber dripping out of his mouth which made really clear how hungry was he for his victims and their fears. One of my favorite scene was when they were throwing rocks at Bowers and his buddies while that loud metal music was playing. Such a thrill!The reason I gave this movie 9/10 and not 10/10 was just because Ben(the chubby one) got really hurt during his adventures in Derry and he was perfectly okay. I mean,Bowers cutting 'H' on his stomach,then falling down,bloody nose and the most dangerous of all when Pennywise cut him with bar that little Beverly put right through his face. That's a case for going to a hospital haha but I guess he was just too strong. :) All in all,excellent movie. Just sit and enjoy!",9,5,12,10 September 2017
