Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Terrible Film
","Since I don't want to give anything away, I just want to say - this is a terrible movie.I was not a huge fan of the first part despite some nice dialogue and great fight sequences, but I was ready to walk out of the second movie after they decided to chat for 20 minutes near the conclusion. The buildup, so well done in Tarantino's later movies like 'Inglorious Bastards', was poorly done in this film. I know the Tarantino fans rate all of his stuff as 9s or 10s, but they are not being objective. This film is a terrible attempt at the revenge violence genre.Now my 1 to 10 scale does not include B-movies, kids garbage, or trendy pop. Each one of those genres has it's own place. I rank this as the worst movie that is popular, and the Shawshank Redemption as the best.",1,3,8,10 September 2011
Avatar," Brief Review - Major Plot Hole *Spoiler*
","Amazing visual movie, I can watch this movie over and over again. Pretty decent for kids too, so that is a plus.The only reasons I don't give this a higher rating is due to the major plot hole. At no time in the movie does Jake tell the blue monkeys WHY they are knocking over their trees. Despite his goal of becoming 'one' with them, he never mentions that the Humans are after the 'Unobtanium' ore.I felt the irony today as I watched interviews with the Afghan people who had no idea what 9/11 meant. Despite being in their country for 10 years, 92% had no idea that 9/11 happened, could not believe Afghanistan could possibly fly planes into buildings 6000 miles away, and they even laughed when they were told that people walked on the moon.Great movie, but the plot hole nags at me.",8,2,4,10 September 2011
Braveheart," Great Movie - Factually Incorrect - Spoiler Warning
","This is a fantastic movie that is factually incorrect. It has an amazing soundtrack, fiercely impressive acting, and adds some wonderful fiction to a mystical figure from Scotland's past.Some interesting facts: 1. Wallace was a member of the Scottish nobility. He was far from being a peasant or dirt farmer. 2. The movie talks about how nobody can withstand a Cavalry charge. This is untrue, traditionally cavalry charges only work against rabble, against any force that is organized cavalry charges are usually easily defeated by trained foes. They were mostly used for flanking attacks and in formations that help to create refused flanks. 3. The Battle of Stirling Bridge is depicted in the film, but it bears little resemblance to the real battle, there being no bridge (due mainly to the difficulty of filming around the bridge itself) and the tactics resembling the Battle of Bannockburn. The main strategic events of the battle (but obviously not the detail) are followed in Robyn Young's novel Requiem. 4. He was actually captured years after his defeat at Falkirk. 5. The sexual implications between him and the queen are complete fiction. 6. Edward did not die any time near the time of Wallace.Just some interesting facts.",10,2,4,10 September 2011
