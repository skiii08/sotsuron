The Blair Witch Project," One of the Hottest Movies
","I must say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I was very impressed. This wasn't your ordinary gory, predictable scary movie. For one thing it was hardly gory and the events in the ending were unpredictable. I enjoyed how they played this movie out. It's authenticity made it interesting and made it very believable. But I advise you: be aware that you will have trouble sleeping the night you have watched it.",10,1,2,11 August 1999
