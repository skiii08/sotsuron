Mission: Impossible III," Just saw it tonight, it was good
","Yes this review Contains spoilers.I think the thing in his head should have been explained more unless I was not paying attention. Other than that, it was indeed good. I was not expecting much but it was better than I thought it would be. I wen to the premiere and Tom was there. Also, I didn't get why his boss was so tough on him but again, maybe I wasn't following the story.I does hold your interest and Tom isn't annoying at all. I think it should get good reviews and should help Tom's image. I liked the way it started with the bit where Tom is captured and Hoffamn threatens to kill his wife right in front of him and then you wonder how it gets to that point. I nver saw the first two but now I would consider it.",9,4,8,3 May 2006
