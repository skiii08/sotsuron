Requiem for a Dream," disturbing...
","I have never seen a movie quite as distrubing as this. The realism was a little to much for me. Throughout the movie I actually empathized with many of the charachters, even though I have never experienced anything  like their situation. The mother's lonliness is apparent throughout the film and her emotional pain becomes pain stakingly obvious as each minute of her life passes. The son, his friend, and girlfriend's trip through the underworld of the drug culture was more than I ever could of imagined in my most horrible dreams.I couldn't help wondering if this was the director's view of hell on earth. Once the movie was done I sat quietly and tried to forget the horrible images that were thrown to the audience.apperently if a movie stirs this much emotion, you know that is masterpiece. I suggest watching it but,once viewed, you'll never want to see it again!",Null,0,1,22 November 2001
