The Blair Witch Project," crowds brainwashed by genius marketing
","Leaves.  Thats all i can say.  Or maybe grass, since these were the two things shown most in the movie.  The movie was in no way scary, and it was only slightly eerie in the few scenes when the 'actors' were not arguing.  I must compliment whoever marketed this movie.  He is a genius. He took one of the worst movies I have ever seen and made a craze out of it.  Not only did people race to the theater to see it, some people were so brainwashed by the marketing schemes that they still thought it was good after they say it. The scariest part of the movie was the camera-work.  Were they really film students???",3,0,1,5 August 1999
American Pie," funny, yet true
","I haven's seen such a high school comedy since 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High.'  I think this even tops it.  It was hilarious, but it really got into the mind of the high school male.  Everyone knows this is how a majority of high schoolers act and this is one of the first movies i've seen that shows this attitude so raw.",8,0,0,5 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," a masterpiece
","'The Sixth Sense' has connected with me like few movies can.  I went into the theater expecting a typical horror thriller, but I saw so much more. It was scary at parts, but it was also very, very touching.  Many times I was startled or maybe even scared, then seconds later I felt sympathy for Cole. 'The Sixth Sense' was an emotional roller coaster. Haley is the most amazing child actor I have ever seen.  He deserves an Oscar for this performance. This was by far the best movie of the year and it is now one of my personal favorites.",10,0,0,15 August 1999
