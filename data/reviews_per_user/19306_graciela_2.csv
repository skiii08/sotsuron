Marie Antoinette," Better to rent
","I was waiting eagerly to see Marie Antoinette, but when I went to see it, it was so disappointing. Two words: no dialogue! Where was the plot??? I know it was about a young, naive rich girl, but come on! Ya, poking fun at the daily rituals of royalty was entertaining but there was something missing...Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI never speak throughout the whole movie, and that makes the movie pointless! All of a sudden they ban together and stick it out in their home against the angry revolutionary mob. wtf! Ya the shoes and candy scenes are aesthetically pleasing but not enough to make it a good movie. Sofia Copola never gets into her main character's mind. She just treats the character like a child, with no growth, no conflict, no sense of self. And the converse! not cool...I was expecting something like Pride and Prejudice with the gorgeous costumes and witty dialogue, but at the end it was more like a boring stream of consciousness.Save yourself the money and time and wait until this one comes out on DVD.",5,11,18,23 October 2006
The Prestige," The best movie of the year
","Great plot! Great acting! And I guessed the secrets of the two main characters, but it was still entertaining to see the ending. The movie kept me guessing until the end.At first I thought that the male characters only used the female characters for their own advantaged-the two magicians pursue the other's secret tricks even after their wives die. But then I realized that they both loved their wives very much. The obsession still destroyed their lives, like the old man warned it would. Both are at the brink of death and we the audience are also left waiting to see what happens to them! I like not knowing more than the characters, it makes the plot so much more interesting and enticing!So worth watching. Now I want to read the book!",10,5,9,23 October 2006
