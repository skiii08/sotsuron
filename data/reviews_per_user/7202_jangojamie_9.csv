Moneyball," One not to miss!
","With an all star cast starring Pitt, Hill, Hoffman and Pratt you can't really go wrong.Honestly going into this film I was 50/50 not knowing much about baseball myself. With the story and impressive writing it manages to grip you enough to not take your eyes off the screen for the duration of the film. It's stupidly impressive seeing what can be done with such small film budgets these days. One not to be missed!",7,1,1,15 July 2019
We Are Marshall," Average, but it's no Friday Night Lights...
","An amazing tribute to a True Story. A great cast and seemed to have a pretty good budget too.. just never really picked up until the end, poorly executed was quite boring throughout.. no player character development just felt like the Matthew McConaughy and Matthew Fox show.",4,0,0,1 August 2019
Bird Box," A Quiet Place 2
",Was very well executed and for a Netflix film I was definitley surprised that they were capable of producing such a great film. Sandra Bullock at her best!,9,1,5,28 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A perfect end to a perfect trilogy
",Watching Endgame I was so excited for it I was like a kid at Christmas. 2 hours and a half later I woke up and we were at the end of the film watching the final battle.Long winded.. but full of those little moments that make it all worth it making into an all time great. Ground breaking visuals and a great finisher for the franchise.,8,0,1,28 June 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 'ANYBODY ORDER FRIED SAUERKRAUT!?'
","All star cast, great story, incredible budget and production value. It's great seeing dicaprio back acting again especially with someone like Pitt at his side. Was easily one of the funniest films ive seen this year.",8,8,20,22 August 2019
Joker," Todd Phillips nailed it
","The more you watched it the better the character development got and the better and more in depth the story got as well. Ok it's quite slow paced but Phoenix is running the show by himself the whole time and not once did I want to look away. Beautiful cinematography and outstanding acting, writing and editing. Ignore any negative reviews and go and see it for yourself he really does give Ledger a run for his money.",9,1,2,7 October 2019
Whiplash," A film you have to see!
","JK Simmons and Miles Teller performances in this amazed me the character development alone was so impressive. Such an underrated film that not many people have seen, this is a golden find for anyone that loves a good gripping film from start to finish.",10,0,0,28 June 2019
The Matrix," I need guns.... lots of guns.
","The wackowski brothers at their best! An unmissable and iconic film known for its groundbreaking special effects for its time.
My No.1 film of all time.",10,1,1,28 June 2019
Sully," Short but sweet
",You can pretty much guarantee that any film Tom Hanks is in that it's going to be pretty good. This film proves that you don't need millions of dollars and explosions to make a film worthwhile watching. All you need is a good solid story about a city coming together when everyone needed each other most.,8,0,0,5 September 2019
