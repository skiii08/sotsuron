Requiem for a Dream," I'm going to write a couple of those so-called spoilers with the hope that other people be spared the ordeal of seeing this movie.
","I dare to say this is the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen almost all the movies. 
Jesuitism Jes'u*it*ism (?), n. [Cf. F. jésuitisme.] 1. The principles and practices of the Jesuits. 2. Cunning; deceit; deceptive practices to effect a purpose; subtle argument; -- an opprobrious use of the word.
This movie, which qualifies as some kind of paradigm for boredom; could be perfectly described with the second entry for Jesuitism in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary's 1913 edition. It is so biased, that it has flown over the boundaries of plain bigotry and extreme anti-drug-right-wing propaganda. G.K. Chesterton used to say that there are more tints in the human soul (human psychology if you are an atheist) than there are greens and browns in the leaves of a forest. Mr. Aronofosky, of course, would not agree with Chesterton; for him is there's only a colorless, somehow mudded, state of mind, which makes it very easy for people to be taken deep into the bottomless abyss of idiocy and Evil. It doesn't matter how much a person can be loved, it doesn't matter how talented or beautiful one can be; the Devil, (i.e. `The Drug') will get them. The Devil wants your soul and if you try `The Drug' but once, he'll get it. Aronofosky tells the story of four more or less normal and not precisely intelligent people, who in one year are driven to Hell and Damnation because of `The Drug': one of them a very beautiful Jewish girl, who becomes a hooker; her boyfriend, also a Jew, ends up in jail and with one arm cut-off; the boyfriend's mate, a black man, ends up in jail and beaten, called nigger and forced to do forced labor; and the Jewish boy's mother, who also becomes a junkie and at the end of her tether is treated unsuccessfully with electroshock therapy. Why on earth would an Yiddishe-momme become an addict? Simply, just because she takes amphetamine pills to loose weight, that she may wear a red dress in a TV show. Of course, TV is Evil, too. TV is the Devil itself, Mr. Aronofosky. Warns us. In spite of the fact that all the junkies in this film are African-American and Jewish; in spite of the fact that drug dealers are Italian-American and African-American; in spite of the fact that the men who drag Jennifer Connelly's character to prostitution are, again, a Jew and an African-American (she gives herself in exchange of drugs, shrilling, isn't it?). And just when we're starting to ask ourselves: Is this movie a racist movie?  The director or the producers realize what we have in mind and try to mend the whole thing providing us, very underhandedly and sneakily, with some redneck cops and doctors in a state 600 miles south of New York. Somebody should have tipped them that placing a bunch of coarse rednecks makes the movie no less a stereotyped racist movie, quite on contrary. This churlish doctor is so mean that refuses to take care of the junkie-Jewish boy's gangrenous arm and gives him up to the no less churlish racist local police. It must be said that the boy gets his arm in such a horrendous shape after shooting the Devil, I mean `The Drug' repeatedly in the same spot, even when the arm is not an arm anymore but a purple piece of rotting meat. The police first try to make him work and noticing he cannot do anything but stink; send him to the hospital to get his arm amputated. The end is one of those all-out endings; Mr. Aronofosky is kind enough to open the gates of his personal look-alike idea of Hell. And he achieves his goal, we're allowed to catch a glimpse of one of the worst infernal circles, the one intended for tediousness and ennui. I've had a nightmarish idea: What if, from time to time, the damned who inhabit down there are mercilessly punished with the projection of this picture?",1,12,28,6 June 2003
American History X," This movie is blatantly racist.
","It can be compared with a pick-pocket who after stealing a wallet starts yelling: Catch that thief, catch that thief!If I were a member of Arian Nation I'd screen this movie as a powerful recruiting tool. All the Nazis wannabes would join with tears in their eyes.A few examples: 1)ALL the fights and trouble are started by African-Americans. 2) Koreans play dirty and get stores from real Americans (please tell me what on earth is a real American) just to fire white employees and hire only illegal immigrants. 3) Hispanics are depicted as bunch of wet-backs who enter the US illegally just to be exploited by greedy Koreans.I have only read twenty comments about this still-born and nobody seems to realize that Nazis are equaled to African-Americans. That is, there are two matching sides, two gangs: on the one hand a bunch of obnoxious nazi skinheads, on the other African-Americans. Not to mention that every relevant African-American character on this movie (by relevant I mean a character who can be seen during ten seconds or more) is a punk, an out-law or a member of gang, -or like Dr. Sweeney, a former member of a gang. Also it should be noted that the director of this thing, underhandedly but also coarsely, drops the idea that the nazi violence is some sort of a reaction against a preceding insult: Nazis are bad, but nazi violence is what you get when African-Americans, Koreans and Mexicans move to your neighborhood, get the all the jobs, win the basket-ball plays and date attractive white women.Intentions behind this libel remind me of the Nazis from the movie Bullet Proof Monk who set a Human Right organization in order to hide their actual intentions.And last but not least, have you counted all those shower slow motion takes. What is this, a shampoo TV commercial?!",1,14,51,11 April 2004
Life Is Beautiful," Despicable fascist propaganda. Benigni's manges to reach the lowest
","This movie is a disgrace; it tries to hide the collaboration of Italian fascists to the deportation of thousands of Jews and non-Jews to death camps during WWII in Italy. Believe me, Italian fascists were as obnoxiously criminal (and sometimes even more) as their German peers. In this fascist revisionist libel Italian fascists are depicted like harmless comical characters untouched by the crimes against humanity, they and their German associates were responsible for, crimes that live and will live in infamy until the end of times.Death camps according Roberto Benigni were some kind of poorly managed boot-camps in which you could mange to survive by means of being slightly more intelligent than the average prisoner. There's a moment of the movie when Benigni manages to reach the lowest  an endeavour you had thought not possible after one hour and a half of the previous ordeal  it is when he, very underhandedly, provides the viewers with a thick mist in order to veil, that is to hide, a pile of corpses of prisoners murdered by the Nazis.Let us suppose, just for the sake of the present argument, that a fascist movie can be funny  this is arguably a fascist movie  well there isn't a single funny scene in this poor excuse for a movie, the joke are trite and all of them can be predicted by someone who has seen at least one cheap comedy before.This thing has been unjustly compared to The Great Dictator, which is maybe the worst movie Charlie Chaplin did, but the the comparison is still unfair, The Great Dictator is an overrated sentimental bad movie, but it is not fascist propaganda like Roberto Benigni's.If you want to see an excellent Italian comedy dealing with the same subject try Lina Wermüller's Pasqualino Settebellezze (1975) http://imdb.com/title/tt0075040. You will not forget the sequence in which the great Giancarlo Giannini seduces a two tons whale-sized SS woman officer in order to save his life.",1,41,99,14 January 2005
