The King's Speech," Even A King has a trouble
","In 1934, the Prince of York, Albert (later becomes King George VI) fails in making speech in front of a large audience because of a speech defect he had. His wife Princess Elizabeth tries to find a good doctor for him and visits the office of Dr.Lionel Logue. Lionel talks to him too friendly and starts an unusual treatmentThe actors of this movie play so well. To pick any expressions or actions of the characters, I could see what they feel vaguely, but they have more complex feelings than to eyes. The actors showed it so skillfully. I can nod to the number of Academy Awards this movie won!At first Albert has not only a speech defect, but also a terrible temper. It is the highlight of this movie that how he changes with Lionel. This is so great a movie as a historical drama and as a human drama.",Null,0,1,21 October 2013
500 Days of Summer," 500days of Summer
","This is a story of a man who believes in fate and true love. On the first day, the man, Tom meets a girl named Summer who looks so cute at his office. Four days later, he and she meet in elevator and enjoy talking about a band 'The Smiths.' Since then, he falls for her so much and they go to several places like IKEA, a park, record shop, and so on. Tom believes that Summer is his fated girl, but Summer's sense is not the sameSummer is a girl who looks pretty but her personality is little selfish and she always trifles with Tom's love. Some people may do not like her character, but other people like her so much. I like her, but if another actress played Summer, my impression might not the same. The actress who played Summer looks clean and beautiful and matches her so much. This movie surely describes a love between Tom and Summer, but at first it is written that this story is not a love story. That amplifies the uncommon charm of this movie.",Null,0,0,21 October 2013
The Artist," A Review
","One day in 1927, a star actor George meets a new face actress named Peppy. He advises her to make a noticeable feature to be a big actress and pencils a false spot on her face. Two years later, because of a change of the screen from silent to talkie, the popularity of George falls but Peppy becomes a top actressWhat it is important that though this movie was made in 2011, it catches the atmosphere of the movies in 1920s. The pictures in this movie is in black and white and the makeup of characters are the very same as the 20s. The discovery of story is a little simple, but the performance of actors and stage direction are great. Motions and expressions of Peppy are very attractive and appearances of George after lose his position are so pathetic. But, more than them, the best player of this movie is the Dog of George!",Null,3,5,21 October 2013
When Harry Met Sally...," An Review
","This movie describes the relationship of a man and woman named Harry and Sally. When first they meet at their university, they had bad impressions each other, but the more they meet and talk, they come to be friends. Since then, they go round for many years just as friends, however, one day at a new year's dance, their relation starts to changeThe main theme of this movie, 'Can a man and woman become real friends?' is a really difficult problem. At the beginning of story, Harry and Sally both have another lover. At first Harry and Sally see each other as her friend's lover and not as object of feeling of love. And I was fussed but enjoyed the way of their feelings change but can't take a step because of their high pride while and after I watch this story. Not only the two, their friends, Jess and Marie is also charming. They hold each other dear and also are concerned about Harry and Sally. They are admirable as a couple and friends!",Null,1,2,21 October 2013
The Reader," A Review
","In German, after the time World War 2, a young boy Michel is helped by an older lady named Hanna when he is suffered from sick on a street. After he gets better, he visits her house to thank her. Hanna always asks him to read books to her. In time, he gets crazy about her, but one day she vanishes from himTo tell the truth, I do not like this movie well. It is true that the pictures of this movie are so beautiful. The views of the streets are the very European ones and I was enchanted with them. However, the pity point is this movie is that the scene of this movie is located in German, the characters speak English and call their names in English pronunciation. I want it to be unified. Second, I do not like the personality of Michel. He loved Hanna when he was 15, but in the late part of the story, he takes a load on his mind about her but somewhat halfway to my eyes. I am disappointed though the story and pictures are great.",Null,0,0,21 October 2013
Atonement," A Review
","In England, 1935, before the war, a noble woman Cecilia and a menial man Robbie was in love. One day, Cecilia's little sister named Briony finds their unusual behaviors by chance and misunderstands their relation. That night an incident happens and Briony charge Robbie falsely Before I watched this movie, I had thought this is a story of a sad love between Cecilia and Robbie. Of course it is an important theme of this movie, after I watched the whole story, I was more impressed with the scenes of war. In the latter story, the three each have to do with the war and see the disastrous sights with their own eyes. The pictures are terribly realistic and I was creep while watching the scenes. Cecilia and Robbie suffers because of their parting, Briony suffers from the weight of her guilt. The refrain of the sound of typewriter and images of water emphasized the impressions of sorrows.",Null,0,0,21 October 2013
