The Ring," One of the better horror movies out there
","My girlfriend and I saw the original in Japanese, and we both agree that the US version is much more suspenseful and scarier than the Japanese one, with the exception of some extraordinarily creepy sequences in the Japanese version. One of the small but significant changes from the original was that the Japanese version had the girl's face mostly hidden by her hair and she never makes eye contact, which I found more effective than Verbinski's treatment. The original also had one scene that I thought was a bit creepier than the remake, when the girl comes to attack the man. Other than that, the changes made were mostly positive.Japanese plots tend to be short on causality and detail, so the story changes, which add about a half hour to the original story line, serve to make the plot coherent to Westerners. The production values in Japan make the fairly high-budget original with A-list actors look like a B-movie to people accustomed to Hollywood films. The ending shows the difference between cultures, since in the original Japanese, the woman appeals to her father for help.There are holes in the plot, as many people have pointed out in reviews. Those that remain are either intentional, like those relating to the essentially unsolved mystery of the tapes and the girl, or were left over from the original Japanese.The lighting and deliberately limited spectrum enhance the mood of the film greatly. The attack on the ex-boyfriend occurring during daylight hours is surprisingly effective even though it flouts the normal rules of horror films. One of the things I liked most about this movie is that it is a bit unconventional, through a combination of good director choices and some fresh ideas borrowed from Japan. People who were expecting to see a kill-em-all slasher flick were probably disappointed by the relatively slow pace in the building of the story and suspense.Overall, I found the film to be a very good treatment of the original story and a fairly creepy horror movie too. It doesn't try to startle you into being frightened, it doesn't offer lots of gore and shocking violence, and it doesn't play down to the audience. The result is a slightly cerebral and haunting movie. There are some images and scenes that will stay with you and still give you the creeps for quite some time after you see it.",9,36,62,13 July 2003
The Bourne Identity," Hooray for decent, more realistic spy films!
","I have grown extremely tired of the typical formula spy film like Bond, or the juvenile stunt exhibition 'Triple X.' There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.Besides 'The Bourne Identity,' 'Ronin' is the only other recent spy movie I can think of that didn't feature skydiving, bungie jumping, skiing downhill while shooting innumerable bad guys, laser pens, cars with ejection seats, or silicone breasted women with names you'd be vaguely embarrassed to say in front of your mother. Most of the crap that passes for an espionage film has no plot or reason for existing other than to meet a quota of explosions and cleavage in order to draw the summer action film crowd.While 'Bourne' does not have a particularly deep plot, it is consistent and focused. The focus is entirely upon Bourne and how he is to deal with having no memory of his past, being hunted without knowing why. Some people have complained about being confused by the movie. I for one, do not need to have everything spelled out since in many cases this smacks of unreality in the first place; the essence of espionage is drawing conclusions from very sketchy information. If you can't handle a little of that, you probably should stick to Disney films or TV's Scooby Doo where everything is explained in the end. We never find out about what is in the case in 'Ronin' and I can live without some information being filled in about Bourne's past.To those who have moaned about the incompatibility of the book and the movie, seek help. There are probably several things that work in the book that would either be boring and take too much screen time to explain, or would be viewed as cliche to modern screen audiences. As I remember, I liked the book, and I definitely like this movie. I view any movie adaptation as an interpretation of the book rather than a translation from words to pictures anyway.As for realism, most of the action scenes are believable, no super-gadgets are to be seen, no incredibly lovely models fall madly in bed with Bourne, and the hero shows definite signs of physical vulnerability despite a very high level of training and competance. As someone who has trained in martial arts for over 10 years, unrealistic fight scenes are a pet peeve. The fights in 'Bourne' are fast, nasty, and very realistic while still being entertaining for the layman. (And yes, taking a gun away from some idiot who is standing well within your striking radius without getting shot is definitely doable, though I had serious doubts until we tested it for ourselves with plastic dart guns in the dojo several years ago).While not being perfect, 'The Bourne Identity' is, simply put, several grades above the typical spy film. Being focused on an individual level rather than involving itself huge political ramifications lends it another layer of respectability rather than detracting from it as some comments have implied since it remains a human problem on a comprehensible scale. The mysteries that are left are bigger mysteries for Bourne than us, and I think should be viewed as intentional omissions rather than loose ends. The implausibilities are kept to a minimum and the realism to as high a level as possible while still being spectacular enough to meet the expectations of the genre.",8,346,402,17 March 2003
The Fast and the Furious," They actually made enough money from this POS for a sequel?
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD. YE BE WARNED!I expected stupid action, but with the emphasis on the 'action' part of that phrase. The director took this movie in so many directions that I think he got lost somewhere. The <ahem> 'plot' twists were stuck on at random in a misguided attempt to add depth to this puddle. Lose the undercover cop thread completely or actually do something with it, beef up the Tran rivalry or drop that too, add to the romantic interest, tone down the macho a**hole rivalry between the meat-head and the new guy (or at least make her a bit sympathetic to the poor loser who obviously has had a crush on her since they were kids), make the kid do a bit more to prove himself, add a couple more driving scenes with some turns instead of just straight-line acceleration, and you might just have a decent movie.Of course, it would be a close copy of 'Point Break' (substitute drivers for surfers, Vin Diesel for Patrick Swayze) with DriveTime(tm) special effects lifted from 'Driven' and a plot that would make 'Gone in 60 Seconds' look profound, but it would be more watchable. I found myself actually checking my watch several times. I made it through 'Pleasantville' with only a couple of watch checks. Whoo. Yay. They hit the nitrous buttons...yet again. How thrilling.Almost the only good scenes in the movie were due to the real street-racer extras who lent this movie some badly needed fun. Hotties and tricked-out cars as eye candy were great bonuses. The fast driving scenes were also well done, but a bit sparse. There was more driving around town than driving fast and furiously. Oh, and was I the only person who thought the method for hijacking the semis was unnecessarily complicated, dangerous, and stupid? Good driving = cool; but the harpoon gun = puuhlease! 'Gee, what an excellent way to get dragged to death under a speeding semi! Where do I sign up for that?'",4,0,1,24 September 2003
