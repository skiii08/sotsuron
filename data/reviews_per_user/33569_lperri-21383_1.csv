The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Loved the characters but over hyped
","I put this on expecting to be blown away with revelations for myself, lots of tears, and lots of love for the movie. And I did really like it and I should be loving it considering the music mentioned in this film & Ezra Miller. I feel like the ending got to busy, is the best way I could put it.",7,0,0,21 April 2020
