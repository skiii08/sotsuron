E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Cheesy Fluff
","This movie really disgusted me. But let me explain....It is not that I don't believe in sentimentality. I am a HUGE Frank Capra fan. And I can't watch 'Field of Dreams' (which I know isn't Capra) without tears in my eyes at many points in the movie. So that isn't it. It's just that 'E.T.' is so phony, so synthetic, so made-up, so ENGINEERED to try to make me feel something, that I have to resent it. I'll just never understand Spielberg. For so long, I had nothing but contempt for him. Till Schindler's List. (Does anyone (other than Nazis) not like Schindler's List?) And then, too, he made Saturday-morning worth getting up for. (Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain). I finally (and grudgingly) had to admit that the man is a genius. But he is a genius who has done some bad work. And E.T. was some of his worst work.",4,28,62,14 January 2001
Spice World," Good clean fun
","People hate this film because it is fluffy and because it features a bubble-gum band. I am not really a fan (my kids are) but I think that musically The Spice Girls are as okay as any other bubble-gum band. However, what could have been really a stupid boring movie, actually WASN'T. It was really quite tight (proving that fluff can be tight). It was cute, funny, fast-moving and had several worthy gags. Rather reminded me of 'Stop Making Sense' (which of course featured a MUCH greater band).",7,1,2,30 September 2001
Sleepy Hollow," In this One Respect, It Went Too Far
","WARNING! This may contain spoilers. In one of Jason's Friday the Thirteenth movies, after slashing his usual myriad of teens, Jason takes a wrong turn into a living room full of small children in their footie pajamas. He looks around, nervous and confused, and makes a hasty exit. He couldn't have been allowed to kill small children in a slasher like that. (In higher art, it could be debatable.)
But 'Sleepy Hollow' was no higher art. It was a slasher with pretensions. It stole the title and main characters' names from THE great American classic, forever besmirching such names, and no doubt causing Mr. Irving to spin.And yet this cut-em-up did not have even the common courtesy, as Jason did, to turn away when presented with a small child.",2,2,4,27 August 2000
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," It's About Temptation and Guilt
","Many people didn't like this film, because it is too dry and cerebral for most horror fans, and too much a horror film for most people who like thoughtful movies. I found the combination amazingly riveting and original.As Anne Rice said in the introduction to the film, 'It is about US.' Her vampires are symbolic of humans in general, but seen from a different vantage point. It is a story of temptation, guilt, shame and remorse. Louis is a vampire (that is, a sinner), he is repentant, he hates the fact that he is one, but nonetheless continues to be one. Like us, Louis wants to know what it is all about, how did this happen, is there a God, is there a devil? And he is always left with doubts.",10,2,3,22 February 1999
