The Blair Witch Project," Over-rated and Amateurish
","The Blair Witch Project was the worst movie and most hyped up film of 1999. The concept was original, but unfortunately the execution of this concept was badly done.  One reason why I thought BWP was bad is that It seem as the movie was made for fun and that they weren't planning to be filmmakers at all.  This change as soon as the film made money and this gave them the idea to direct again.  The success of this movie reminds me of Mel Brooks's The Producers where a play(Spring Time For Hitler)became a surpise success. Another reason this wasn't good is the lack of artistic vision(that is it seems like there wasn't anything put into this film at all by the directors.
The shack at the end of the movie reminded me of the Freudstein House in The House by the Cemetery(maybe the three college kids were killed not by The Blair Witch but by Dr. Freudstein).  The Blair Witch Project is not as scary as many people would lead others to believe, and it does not contain anything that is scary(rocks found in piles, Twigs formed in shapes, people arguing, and footage of people losing their mind is not my idea of a scary movie).  The actors in the film behave as escapees from an Insane Asylum.  I found that this movie is not as enjoyable as the supernatural thrillers of Mario Bava{The Mask of Satan(1960), Kill, Baby, Kill(1967), and The Whip and The Body(1966)], the surreal films of Dario Argento{Suspiria(1977), and Inferno(1980)], and the gothic/zombie epics of Lucio Fulci{Zombie(1979), The Gates of Hell(1980), The Beyond(1981), and The House by the Cemetery(1981)]. I prefer the cinema of Italian horror to The Blair Witch Project as they are filled with spectacular gore, great camera movement, interesting music, terrific atmosphere, and lots of pizzazz(Things that BWP completely lacks). What annoys me is that people have already start to compare the film-makers to Alfred Hitchcock which is silly as HE IS THE MASTER while they are the students.",3,0,1,28 February 2000
Vertigo," Hitchcock's most personal film
","Although my favourite Hitchcock film is Strangers On A Train, this is his masterpiece as well as one of his darkest films since it deals with the theme of obsession.  This movie is the closest Hitch comes to fully expressing his inner demons to nearly being explicit.  The beginning of this film can be seen as a continuation of Rear Window.  Vertigo (1958) also deals with some similar themes explored in Rear Window (1954).  This is the third film that deals with a person's mental state.  The other two being Spellbound (1946), which dealt with a man's fear of white, and Marnie (1964), which dealt with the main character's fear of red.  This motion picture is a highlight of the director's fame career and should be considered on any top ten greatest films list.",10,6,7,15 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Best Has Yet to Come
",The first film of the new trilogy was a disappointment after the greatness of the first trilogy.  The first problem is its all machine with no soul. The second problem is that there are no compelling characters in the new Star Wars like with the 1977 version with people like Han Solo and Chewbacca.  The third problem is the character of Jar Jar Binks who behaves like a slave from a Caribbean Island during Colonial times.Star Wars:The Phantom Menace(1999) does a poor job in the development of Anakin Skywalker.  Jake Lloyd does a good job despite having little to work with.  This film deals with events that leads to the status shown in Star Wars(1977).  Natalie Portman is passable in her role as the queen.I believe the best of the new trilogy will be the third film when Anakin becomes Darth Vader.  Star Wars: Episode One(1999) is a shaky building block for episodes two and three.  The best scene in the whole movie are the Jedi council scenes.  Its entertaining but not as good as Star Wars(1977) or The Empire Strikes Back(1980).,Null,1,3,18 April 2000
Ghost," Demi Moore's Top Role in an Otherwise Average and Disappointing Acting Career
","Lighted hearted and touching film about love and death.  Demi Moore gives the performance of her life as Molly Jensen.  Her career has never been the same as she has put in many lousy performances over the next few years. Its too bad because she shows here that she can act with the right material. Directed by Jerry Zucker who is mostly known for his parody comedies like Ruthless People(1986), Top Secret!(1984), and Airplane!(1980). Ghost(1990) gave new direction to the career of Jerry Zucker.  Whoopi Goldberg is good here because she is not overly annoying like in other films that she has been in.",Null,3,7,1 August 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Action Extravaganza
",Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981) is a high spirited adventure flick with a multiple supply of cliffhangers.  Has to be one of the best films by Steven Speilberg besides Jaws(1975) and E.T.(1982).  Tom Sellect was originally chosen to play Indiana Jones but decided on starring in a TV show so Harrison Ford got the part instead.  I'm actually glad that it was Harrison Ford and not Tom Sellect who got the role.  The climax of Raiders of the Lost Ark(1981) is a cross between The Devil Rides out(1967) and Quatermass & the Pit(1967).  Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action classic that has been repeated but not surpassed.,Null,0,0,4 December 2000
Casablanca," Romantic Film For Everyone
","Casablanca(1942) is such a great piece that has evoked a tremendous amount of emotion from people in many different ages.  Humphrey Bogart's performance is right behind his other performances in John Huston's Treasure of the Sierra Madre(1948), and Nicolas Ray's In a Lonely Place(1950). Ingrid Bergman is absolutely stunning as Ilsa, the woman who broke Rick's heart.  In over the 100 plus movies that Michael Curtiz has done in his life, Casablanca(1942) is the best bar none.  Don Siegal was involved in the movie for the responsibility of Montage.  Casablanca(1942) is and will always remain in the hearts of film lovers around the globe.",Null,0,0,13 November 2000
Chinatown," Masterpiece
","Chinatown(1974) is the Noir feature that all Neo Noirs made today look up as their inspiration.  Filled with excellent acting, great story, superb direction, terrific music, and wonderful writing.  Chinatown was made in a great year for films(1974) that included The Conversation and The Godfather Part 2.  I wasn't big with the movie when I first saw it but after a few viewings came to love it for its depiction of corruption and evil. Chinatown is not a pure Film Noir because its not a black and white movie and doesn't have any low key and high contrast lighting.Chinatown(1974) was filmed during the daytime.  This contrasts other Noirs as they usually are filmed at night.  This changed the way Noir pictures would be perceived.  Many Neo Noirs after Chinatown(1974) would follow in the film's lead by having the action take place during the day.  This is a rare instance where the Noir picture is given a daytime atmosphere that works.Chinatown(1974) was the first Noir to be shown in color.  This was because the movie had a much bigger budget compared to the average Film Noirs of the 1940s and 1950s.  Also, black and white photography was out of style during this period.  The director wanted to try something different by filming Chinatown in color instead of doing it in the usual black and white. Chinatown(1974) as well as L.A. Confidential(1997) are the few Noir features that are helped by color.There were many disagreements during the making of Chinatown.  The director and writer had separate ideas on how the film should be portrayed.  Robert Towne did an excellent job in writing the screenplay. Robert Towne has not been involved in anything this good since.  The film's true brilliance goes to director, Roman Polanski who brings things to life with perfect execution.Jack Nicholson gives out the best acting job of his career in role of J.J. Gittes.  Jake Gittes is in the tradition of Sam Spade and Phililp Marlowe. He is involved in the same line of detective work as Mickey Spillane protagonist, Mike Hammer.  The actor plays his character with panache.  His performance is worthy of the legendary Humphrey Bogart.The art direction is a marval to behold.  The depiction of 1930s Los Angeles is outstanding.  Los Angeles is portrayed as mysterious and guilty.  The actors do a terrific job at blending in with the art designs.  Its one of the most beautiful film designs that I've ever seen.Chinatown(1974) has its share of memorable lines.  one great is by Noah Cross which goes as 'Whores, buildings, and politicans become respectible if they last long enough'.  Another great line is 'The future, Mr. Gitts, the future' when asked by Gittes on why he is committing fraud.  The best line of the film is 'see, Mr. Gitts, most people never have to face the fact that, at the right time and the right place, they're capable of anything'. Finally, there is the classic line 'As little as possible'.Chinatown(1974) is an unique motion picture because of its double plot. The two plots of the film are the water plot and incest plot.  The two plots although different from each other are in reality interrelated.  The water plot deals with money and power and the incest plot has to do with control for the future and power.  These two plots combined are related to the theme of evil, greed, and power.John Huston is outstanding as the evil and villainious Noah Cross.  Faye Dunaway is fascinating and powerful as the doomed Mrs. Mulwray.  Roman Polanski makes a memorable appearence as the man with the knife.  The director's best films are Chinatown(1974), Repulsion(1965), and The Tenant(1976).  Chinatown(1974) is a great motion picture of immortal proportions.",Null,1,3,19 December 2000
Citizen Kane," THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME!
","Citizen Kane(1941) has not only endured the test time but the early negative criticisms to become the #1 film in cinema history.  There are three things that make the movie enduring.  First, the complex nature of the title character.  Second, the amazing technical innovations that changed the face of cinema.  Third, the ability to make people from generation to generation give nothing but admiration for this classic.Citizen Kane was not the first choice for Orson Welles.  He originally planned to do a film adaptation of Joesph Conrad's Heart of Darkness that ended up falling through.  Before this film, Welles was known for his infamous broadcast of The War of the Worlds.  Orson Welles is one of the few artists to succeed in everly level of visual art and communications.  He was heavly influenced by John Ford which helped him in making Citizen Kane. Because of his anti Hollywood atittude, Welles like a few others would be beloved by members of the French New Wave during the late 1950's.The film is slightly based on the career of William Randolph Hearst, although some portrayal of the older Kane seems to be based on Joe Kennedy, JFK's father.  Its about a man who goes from being an idealistic crusader to a bitter and corrupt old man.  An amazing fact is that Welles had absolute control in making Citizen Kane(a rarity then as in now).  The film's expressionistic look with the use of shadows and weird angles helped begin the era of Film Noir.  It was both Citizen Kane and The Maltese Falcon(done by first timers John Huston & Orson Welles) that helped create one of the greatest periods in movie history.The film begins with Kane's death as the story looks back at his life.  A reporter is assigned to discover the meaning of Kane's last word.  The first flashback shows Kane as a young boy and the event that would have an effect on him for the rest of his life.  It goes from his time with his caretaker to inheriting a fortune to opening a newspaper company.  The second flashback looks at the early and idealistic period of Charles Foster Kane.The fourth flashback focuses on Charles Foster Kane's first marriage, his political ambition/disgrace, and his failed marriage.  This flashback also reveals the affair that ruined his political career and first marriage. The next flashback shows his second marriage with Susan Alexander as well as her opera career, firing of Jed Leland, and the construction of Xanadu.  The film climaxes with Kane's loniness and yearning to return to his days of innocence.  The reporter comes to the conclusion that there is no conclusion to the meaning of Charles Foster Kane.There are four remarkable sequences in Citizen Kane.  One, the opening scene.  Two, the passage of time scene where the distance between Charles Kane and his wife widen.  Three, the opera scenes with Susan Alexander. Four, the closing scene.Citizen Kane was co-written by Herman J. Mankiewich and Orson Welles.  The direction helps carry the story along.  William Randolph Hearst hatred the film and tried to have it destroyed.  It didn't help that Hollywood resented Welles for being a genius and an upstart.  Citizen Kane(1941) and The Trial(1963) were the only films in which Orson Welles had complete artistic control.Citizen Kane is a great film that was cheated out of many Oscars including Best Picture.  The director had used the John Ford/John Wayne vehicle Stagecoach(1939) as an inspiration for his feature debut.  In fact, Welles had watched Stagecoach about forty times during the making of the film. The cast and crew were members of Welle's Mercury Theatre.  The insertion of Kane into footage with famous world leaders is nothing short of brilliant.Orson Welles does a balancing act of being selfish and sympathetic.  Orson Succeed under the three hat role of director, writer, and producer. Joesph Cotten is super as Jed Leland in his portrayal of a hurt and betrayed man. The themes of friendship and betrayal would appear in films like The Third Man(1949), and Touch of Evil(1958).  An early cameo is made by Hollywood legend Alan Ladd.The ten greatest films of all time are 1.Citizen Kane(1941), 2.The Wild Bunch(1969), 3.City Lights(1931), 4.Battleship Potemkin(1925), 5.Raging Bull(1980), 6.The Godfather(1972), 7.Vertigo(1958), 8.Eight & a Half(1963), 9.Seven Samurai(1954), and 10.The Searchers(1956).   Its fitting that the Film Noir period began with Citizen Kane in 1941 and ended with Touch of Evil in 1958.  The film editor was West Side Story director Robert Wise. Welles had hurt his hands during the filming of the destruction of his second wife's room.  The somber music was done by future Alfred Hitchcock collaborator, Bernard Hermann.",Null,2,3,25 September 2000
Happy Gilmore," Not Caddyshack
",Great comedy its not but there are some humorous scenes that make it watchable.  The character Adam Sandler plays is like an adult version of the mischievous JR from Problem Child(1990).  One thing I find interesting is Problem Child(1990) is not well liked by probably the same people who flock out to the theatres to see Sandler's films even though they have the same type of humor.  Vast improvement over Billy Madison(1996) and a little more mature.  The scene with Bob Barker is my favorite in the whole movie.  Happy Gilmore(1996) is an average film with some memorable scenes that makes it worthwhile for a short span of time.,Null,1,2,2 May 2001
Batman Returns," Opinion of The Movie Changed Over the Years
","When I first Saw this film, I wasn't as big on it as I was on the first one. This feeling went on for many years and it is reflected in an earlier review I wrote on the film back in 2002. Now, after having seen Batman Returns within the last 4 to 6 years, I have had a changed of mind on this film and consider it my favorite of the four Batman films made from 89-97. It has a feel that I connected with more recently than I did during my earlier viewings. The villains walk a blurred line between evil and pathetic and sometimes this line blurs where they are interchangeable. Sure the film has its flaws, but still I think it is well made and a little underrated. That is a sadness that hovers over the characters like a overseeing shadow. I wish they had bought back Michelle Pfeiffer's Cat Woman for another film.",9,5,11,19 July 2014
Batman Returns," Dark Undertones
","While not as good as the first film, Batman Return(1992) is way better than the last two when the series became dumb and dumber.  Deals with childhood traumas, and adult angst that results from feelings of alienination during childhood years.  Not one of the main characters were blessed with happy memories of their childhood, and each has their own alter-ego to fight this traumatic pain.  The opening scene is an example of this idea, and one which leads to the main theme of the movie.
Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman becomes more melencoly, more saddened by unhappy childhood memories, and saddled with a feeling of loneliness. Danny Devito is a disappointing followup as a villain after the flamboyant performance of Jack Nicholson in Batman(1989).  Michelle Pfeiffer is both sexy and hard edged in the role of Catwoman, which is her most complex and ambiouous.  When Tim Burton did the Batman films they were very good, and had some provocative ideas about childhood memories, and the feelings of being an outsider.
I would have to see a director's cut of this sequel as I feel that some scenes look as if they were trimmed, and maybe there were good scenes cut from the film to fit a PG-13 rating.  Scenes, which feels trimmed are the erotic games of cat and mouse between Batman and Catwoman.  Films based on comics are more interesting when good and evil become a grey matter where nothing is certain, and the architecture stands with a moody broodish quality.  Christopher Walken plays his usual sarcastic evil villain, and plays it with a dark coldness that is a trademark of a Walken villain.",9,0,0,14 March 2002
Home Alone," Average Film
",Home Alone(1990) is a mediocre movie with an uneasy amount of cartoonish violence.  The problem with the film is the characters do things that most people would not normally do.  Joe Pesci is wasted in this movie as he gives the only interesting performance of the entire movie.  One sad thing about this movie is that this may be the only film that Macaulay Culkin will be known mainly for.  Its a fine film for the holidays but not as an overall viewing experience.,Null,2,4,6 April 2000
L.A. Confidential," Throwback to Film Noir Era of 40's and 50's
","L.A. Confidential is the film that Mulholland Falls should have been.  In my opinion, it is the best film of it's kind since Chinatown(1974).  The direction by Curtis Hanson is good and the performances by everyone is wonderful.  L.A. Confidential does a good job of contrasting the perception of 1950's Los Angeles with it's realities.Kim Bassinger does an excellent job as Lynn Bracketts as she fills her character with tenderness.  The movie does well in showing the code of silence mentality used by the police force of Los Angeles.  L.A. Confidential also does a great job in introducing the three main characters. The movie goes from portraying them as unlikeable people to slowing making them understandable(White and Exley have the same quest for Justice except with different ideas).",Null,0,0,25 February 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Hammer Wannabe
","Sleepy Hollow(1999) is a nice looking but failed attempt at doing an American Hammer Horror film.  Johnny Depp is passable as Icabod Crane and Christina Ricci is wonderful as the young woman who may or may not be a witch.  The plot seems less like The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and more like The Plague of the Zombies(1966), and The Reptile(1966).  The set designs were wonderful and the look of the movie atmospheric.  The reason I saw this movie was the appearence of Christopher Lee with the hope that he would have plenty of screen time.",Null,0,0,29 March 2000
Alien," Gothic Scifi
","One of ten important science fiction films ever made with a gripping story, suspenseful situtations, sympathetic performances, and excellent artitect. Changed the way filmmakers in Hollywood and around the world saw at how Science Fiction films should be done.  Alien(1979), 2001:A Space Odyssey(1968), and Metropolis(1926) are the three most copied science fiction films since film was born.  Alien(1979) relies on the psychological reactions of the main people of Captain Dallas, Ripley, Lambert, Brett, Kane, Ash, and Parker.  In the order of what is the best to worst I would go with 1.Aliens(1986), 2.Alien(1979), 3.Alien3(1991), and 4.Alien 4(1998).
The first film is a gothic thriller transported to space.  The designs by HR Giger are a marvel to look at.  Atmosphere and dread are two areas that are the film's strongest points.  Introduced the most famous female figure in a Scifi flick to the person of Ripley.  Early concepts in making the film had Ripley being a man but was changed to make the character a strong but vurnable woman.Inspiration for Alien(1979) is a combination of three films(It!The Terror from Beyond Space[1958], Planet of the Vampires[1966], and Shivers[1975]) which played an important role in the look, feel, mood, and situations of the film.  British flavored Scifi feature for obvious reasons.  Utilizes the music of Mozart to convey the sense of suspense and terror in the story. Mozart's 'Eline Kleine Nachtmusik' enforces the cold, expecting, and unknown fear felt in the halls of the Nostromo ship.  There are scenes of chilling horror and anticipating terror within the plot.Written with a flair for the imagination by Dan O' Bannon.  Filled with brilliant moments like the alien popping out of the chest of Kane, the death of Brett, and the search in the alien ship where one of the crew members discovers piles of eggs.  In the original script there was a sex scene between Captain Dallas and Ripley that ended up not being filmed.  Its too bad such a scene wasn't done because it would have tighten the tension felt in the triangular relationship of Captain Dallas, Ripley, and Lambert. Also, this scene would explain why Lambert has some resentments towards Ripley.Sigourney Weaver plays the role that made her into a minor star and jump started her career as a serious female acting performer.  Before she became known as the female Rambo in her performance for the sequel, Aliens(1986). Alien(1979), Blade Runner(1982), and Legend(1984) are Ridley Scott's three film masterpieces of his film life.  Certainly a way superior film than Gladiator(2000).  One film that would be excellent in blending Science Fiction with Horror besides and after Alien(1979) is John Carpenter's The Thing(1982) except with a different appoarch.",Null,2,4,16 November 2001
Battleship Potemkin," Six Star Excellence
","Bronenosets Potyomkin/Battleship Potemkin(1925) was made to comemorate the twentifth anniversary of the Russian Rebellion of 1905.  It is the greatest silent film of all time as well as the greatest foreign film of all time. Its a political films with messages that support the idea of communism.  The story takes place after the defeat at the hands of the Japanese Navy during Russia's war with Japan.  The power of image takes place in this film espcially in the Odessa steps massacre.  The use of montage is surpurb and the acting is very good.  It contains one of the most famous scenes in the history of the cinema with the 'Odessa Steps massacre'.  It would be borrowed from De Palma for The Untouchables(1987), and parodied for The Naked Gun 33.3(1991).  It was recently restored after years of being cut due to the violent and sometimes bloody scenes depicted in the film.  This year marks the 75th Anniversary of the movie which is a reason to give this film special treatment to be released in the theatres as this is a movie that deserves it.",Null,2,5,5 May 2000
Taxi Driver," Fantastic Study Of a Man Losing His Grip on Reality
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Travis Bickle is an icon of the 1970s in the same way that Norman Bates is an icon of the 1960s.  He is a fascinating and scary character.  Travis Bickle is perfectly played by Robert De Niro.  De Niro's role as Travis Bickle is a role that should be put up there with the likes of Peter Lorre's Hans{M}, Anthony Perkins Norman Bates{Psycho}, Carl Boehm's Karl Lewis{Peeping Tom}, and Michael Rooker's Henry Lee Lucus{Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer}.  By the end Travis Bickle is closer to the point of being someone like Henry Lee Lucus from Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer.
The Wrong Man(1958) is one of the main influences on Taxi Driver(1976). Especially true in the POV shots of Travis Bickle.  Also, like in Alfred Hitchcock's film, the camera follows the eyes of Bickle in a tight close up shot.  Has the same feeling of Paranoia that plagues the main character of The Wrong Man(1958).  An example of this is the moment when Henry Fonda is placed between two Policemen in the back of a small car.
The theme of alienation plays an important role in the personal world of the narrator.  The other Scorsese film where alienation is an essential part of the film is the underrated Last Temptation of Chirst(1988).  Alienation affects many of the male characters in the director's movies. The more alienated Bickle becomes the more deranged he acts.  One of the realistic portrait of alienation and loneliness on celluloid.
The direction is great because Martin Scorsese films many scenes which are memorable and powerful.  What makes the direction great is the way the movie goes from scene to scene without any major problems.  I know that a master is a work with the sheer brilliance of the important sequences.  He brings out the best in actors like Cybill Shepherd.  Its the closet thing to a horror picture Martin Scorsese has ever done.
Excellent in showing that the line between hero and assassin is extremely blurry.  Ironic that Travis Bickle is branded a hero for killing a pimp after being a trigger away from assassinating a politican. Shows the difference between being a hero or murderer is based on who Society sees as acceptable or not acceptable.  Travis Bickle is seen as a hero because he's in a time period where people crave for heros.  In this regard Travis Bickle is similar in some ways to Pechorin of Mikhail Lermontov's novella, A HERO OF OUR TIME.
One of the most recognizable lines and scenes belongs to Taxi Driver(1976) in the memorable mirror scene.  The most famous of all De Niro's acting moments.  Takes an eerie look in the dual mind of Travis Bickle.  Tour de force job for an actor who gives many great performances like this in almost every film he has appeared in.  Lots of improv was done by De Niro because he does not act the same way twice.
The meeting with Betsy and Iris in a coffee shop are an interesting contrast.  First, Travis is compelled by what Betsy has to say and repelled by the things Iris says.  Second, Betsy is seen as conservative while Iris is looked up as rebellious.  Third, Betsy and Iris have different ideas on the meaning of life.  The only thing the two meetings in a coffee shop have in common are they both follow up in disaster.
One scene which impressed is when the camera moves away from Travis talking on the phone with Betsy and stands still into an empty hallway. Illiustrates that its too painful for the camera to watch Travis being rejected by Betsy. More painful for the camera to see than the carnage in the hallway of the Pimp's place during the climatic scene.  Symbolic of the emptiness and shame felt by Travis Bickle during this one moment. Makes the viewer for a moment sympathize with Travis Bicke.
The shootout in the climatic scene is very bloody and gory.  The desaturation of the color of blood is the only reason Taxi Driver(1976) wasn't given an X rating.  What disturbs many is not the violent content when first previewed but the high emotional intensity of the color red. The make up effects are effective and filled with a little stark realism.  As intense in colors as the murder scenes from Mario Bava's classic giallo, Blood & Black Lace(1964).
The final scene feels like a dream in progress.  Some terrific acting is given by the supporting cast including Cybill Shepherd, Peter Boyle, Jodie Foster, Albert Brooks, Harvey Keital.  Taxi Driver(1976) is an modern take of the masterful John Ford western, The Searchers(1956).  Fantasticly written by Independant writer and director, Paul Schrader.  Martin Scorsese feature that definitely is influenced by the horror pictures Mario Bava did in color during the mid 1960s to early 1970s.",10,0,0,2 July 2001
The Godfather: Part II," Back to Back Masterpieces
","Two different eras are depicted as comparisons of Vito, and his son Michael, and the generation that defines them.  Past sequences showing Vito as a young man are written with a feeling of nostalgia.  Contemporary moments involving Michael at same age is framed in a declining mode.  Two films in one to show how different father and son were from each other during the same age they are shown as.  One thing in common with both people are their tragic upbringing.
The Godfather(1972) dealt with the family structure and the difficulties which comes with the territory.  The Godfather Part 2(1974) is a study in corruption and power.  The theme of power in The Godfather Part 2(1974) is explored in a historical perspective by director, Francis Ford Coppola. Power as represented by Michael Corleone is cold blooded, iron clad, and shadowly.  Also, film contrasts Michael and Vito in how their deal with power at a comparative age.
There are some instances where Part 2 is better than Part 1.  First, the acting of Al Pacino is much improved and extraordinary.  Second, the characters and story expand to give them more depth.  Third,  Part 2 adds another dimension with inclusion of backstory to compliment main plot. Overall, The Godfather Part 2 is a masterful followup to the first film.
Talia Shire develops her character further in Part 2 with her loose woman portrayal of 'Connie' Corleone.  Robert Duvall again performs brilliantly in the role of Tom Hagen.  John Cazale gives a performance full of pathos and tragedy.  G.D. Spradlin is convincing two faced and sleezy as Senator Geary. Diane Keaton turns the character of Kay into someone who is unable to coexist with criminal element of Corleone family.
Outstanding performance from Robert De Niro that was worthy of the Oscar he received for role in movie.  Mean Streets(1973) gave De Niro recognition and The Godfather Part 2(1974) give him a breakthrough role.  Among the five top performances, the legendary actor has contributed to the big screen.  One of many examples in why I think he is the greatest actor who ever lived.  He doesn't just play Vito Corleone, he becomes him.
Plot focuses on the decline of the Corleone family, especially Michael Corleone.  Michael went from being an idealistic young man who didn't want to have anything to do with family business to becoming a cold and ruthless mob boss.  Al Pacino injects some new character facets which weren't in Part One.  Al Pacino brings a complexity to his role that makes Michael a tragic figure.  The moments involving 'Fredo' and Michael are touching and tragic.
Michael's marriage to Kay is more out of convenience and fear of loneliness than love.  Apparent in how they treat each other in the second film.  I believe things might have turned out differently for Michael as a human being if his first wife wasn't killed.  Hearing sequences balances between the comic and the dramatic.  The New York as depicted in Vito's youth feels authentic and nostalgic.
Murder of Fanucci by young Vito Corleone is played out with heart beating anticipation.  In the book, THE GODFATHER, the murder of Fanucci is played in a more conventional manner with Vito following him to an empty warehouse where he kills him.  In the film, the murder of Fanucci is more stylized, and reliant on building out suspense and tension.  Handled well by both actors involved in scene and Francis Ford Coppola.  Fanucci is memorablely played by Milano Calibre 9(1972) star, Gastone Moschin.
At one point before production started, Martin Scorsese was considered as a possible director for The Godfather Part 2.  Because of the first film's box office success, Francis Ford Coppola was kept on as director for second film.  James Caan makes a small but vital cameo during flashback scene near the end.  Reconstructs the events that lead to Cuban Revolution in subjective fashion.  A key line in Godfather trilogy is spoken by Michael when he says;'If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is you can kill anyone.'
Its a key line because it symbolizes how the Corleones do business within their political and organized crimes ties.  There is a lot of truth to this line from Michael because its a representative of what has happened throughout, and will continue to happen in the course of human existence. Corleone family is beset by tragedy that began with murder of Vito's father, and continues on in Michael's generation.

Duck Soup," Marx Brothers Finest Film
","Duck Soup(1933) is the funniest and most entertaining comedy that I've seen in my life.  It was the last film the Marx Brothers would do for Paramount before going over to MGM.  Duck Soup is an anarchic comedy where the main characters never live by the rules and rebel as a result.  The Marx Brothers put out some of the greatest comedies that rarely has been matched.  It is a satire about the nature of war, politics, and affairs of the state.  Duck Soup(1933) is a great example of a film that can easily induce a person into bursts of laughter.",Null,30,53,5 April 2000
Aliens," Worthy Sequel To Original
","Aliens(1986) is not only one of the best films of the 1980's, but also a terrific sequel(a rarity) to Ridley Scott's Alien(1979).  Its interesting to know that David Cronenberg rejected the offer to do this film for it was his feature film debut Shivers(1975) that played a major influence on the Alien series(He would instead direct a more personal film called Dead Ringers-1988).  Aliens(1986) comes on the heels of The Terminator(1984), James Cameron's breakthrough motion picture.  It has exciting scenes of action and chilling scenes of horror.  This is my favorite of the Alien series because it has characters to care about, terrific set designs, and a effective mixture of action, science fiction, and horror.What also makes it my favorite is the emotional relationship between Sigourney Weaver as Ripley and Newt, and their treatment of each other.  It is easy to sympathize with the Commando Unit because of their inability to deal with the aliens.  Aliens(1986) explores the fears of Ripley of what might happen to her.  The designs of the creatures were as good as usual. Aliens not only deals with the fear of the unknown, but also with facing up to fear.The direction of James Cameron is first rate as well as the acting.  This is another movie where James Cameron comes up with a breathtaking climax as in his other films...I.E., The Terminator(1984), Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991), and True Lies(1994).  I recommand the Special Edition of Aliens for the following reasons.  First, it shows how the colony was infected with the alien virus.  Second, it is more detailed in explaining the mother-daughter relationship with Ripley and Newt(I also suggest watching Aliens in widescreen format).",Null,0,0,3 March 2000
The Exorcist," Deserved Best Picture Award of 1973
","A mindboggling feature that beautifully mixes physical and psychological horror.  It was well directed by William Fredkin. This came on the heals of his award winning film for Best Picture, The French Connection(1971).  The director had made a drastic shift from doing an action crime flick to making a horror picture.  The new director's cut released this year adds a little more to the film's frightening images.
The only thing I didn't enjoy about the director's cut is the new ending. The Exorcist(1973) is based on a true incident.  The Exorcist(1973)'s success would spawn numerous knockoffs(the best would be Richard Donner's The Omen-1976).  Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair give the performances of their life.  At one point, Exorcist 2 director John Boorman was offered to do the first film.
The scene where Max Von Sydow stands at one corner and a statue at another corner is reminescint of the chess match from Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal(1957).  Jason Miller does wonders as a priest who is tormented and has lost his faith.  One reason The Exorcist is a classic compared to The Blair Witch Project is that when Regan starts swearing its shocking because she's a sweet faced young girl who turns nasty(The swearing in TBWP is irriating because the characters like some humans are stupid).  The scenes of the exorcisms and the desperation to cure Regan are related to the darkness of the human soul.  The infamous spider walk is one of the film's shocking moments.
Its pathetic that The Exorcist(1973) was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won only two.  This proves that the people who pick for Best Picture have no clue in what they're doing and that the best film never gets nominated or wins the Best Picture Award at the Oscars.  The director pushed his actors to the limits and tested their human spirit.  The author of the book does a good job in translating it unto the big screen.  The Exorcist(1973) is a serious horror film that is nothing to laugh at.",Null,1,3,18 October 2000

","The Dirty Dozen(1967) is an entertaining movie full of exciting action and great acting.  The film is about 12 convicts who are sent on a secret mission to Germany in order to assassinate some generals.  Robert Aldrich's direction is crisp and fast paced.  The Dirty Dozen is my favorite World War 2 movie.  Its another film that was influenced by the Seven Samauri.  Was done at a time when many Hollywood features had some true all star casts compared to some of today's films.  Lee Marvin is both tough and hard as the individualistic, Major John Reisman.  The Dirty Dozen is one of the top ten films that Charles Bronson has been in.  The story is excellent and the music is good.  One favorite scene is when the convicts overtake Robert Ryan's troops during a military exercise.  Another favorite scene is when Donald Sutherland is asked to impersonate a general.  John Cassavetes gives the film's best performance as the cocky Victor Franko.

1941," Ahead of its Time
","The reason I think this motion picture was not popular is the film was too spectacular in its appearence that many audiences felt they were bombarded with wasted noise.  Now if the film was released today there would be a different response from the audience because they would love the film more. Today the film would be a box office smash.  Look at films like Independence Day(1996) and Armegeddon(1998) and realize that they are no different from 1941 in the way they were done.  The film is alright but might have been great if the story was as impressive as the cast.  Would be one of the last films that would have a true all star cast until the late 1990s.  I have never seen an excellent cast wasted on a film as I've seen on this feature.
John Candy shows his presence with the kind of charm that became his trademark.  John Belushi steals the show as Captain Wild Bill Kelso.  His performance in the movie makes the film interesting to watch.  Good performances are also given by legendary actors Christopher Lee, Toshiro Mifune, and Warren Oates.

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Weak Motion Picture for Steven Speilberg
",Maybe the book was more interesting or a very good read but the film looks like it could only take out the lousy parts and intergrate them into the picture.  It wouldn't surprise me that the book had more three dimensional chracters and some good plot devices than what was in the movie.  Its a film that belongs to the bottom five in the filmogragphy of Steven Spielberg. The musical score by John Williams is well below some of his best work on film score.  The opening sequence is the only good scene the film has to offer.  Jeff Goldblum returns as Dr. Ian Malcolm in a one dimensional role. As I called the first film of this trilogy Dinoworld for my summary then I will refer this film as Dinoworld 2: The Dinos are Loose.  Pete Postlethwaite is wasted in a lousy movie with his almost film saving performance.  The only aspect of the movie that makes it worthwhile to watch.  Makes a reference to the classic Gojira(1954) which is superior in acting and direction.  The dinosaurs in the film are not as menacing as Godzilla was in the first Gojira picture.  The Lost World:Jurrasic Park 2(1997) was one of my ten least favorite films from the year of 1997.  The movie is shallow and uninteresting in many ideas and themes.,Null,0,0,21 August 2001
Amadeus," A Tale of Two Musicians
","Amadeus(1984) is an epic journey into the obsession and perfection driven music life of the legendary Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  The story is told in the third person narrative by Mozart's rival, Salieri.  The film at first suggests that Mozart was murdered.  This changes as Salieri is presented as a tormented and guilt ridden man.  Milos Forman does a great job in recreating the Vienna of Mozart's time.
Presents Mozart as a talented but goofy and obnoxious young musician. Salieri in his early life believes in god until he sees the greatness in a person that was obnoxious and rude.  Salieri resents god more than he hates Mozart and takes this anger out on Mozart.  F Murray Abraham gives a performance of great tragedy and high emotion.  Amadeus(1984) is half true and half fiction.
What the film says is that its easiler to identify with mediocrity than it is to identify with pure genius.  After all, pure genius is something  that is a rare quality among human beings.  Even a rarer quality in the field of art and artists.  Mozart was a genius whose music at times rubbed people the wrong way.  It was his genius that gave him room to be goofy and obnoxious.
Tom Hulce was the perfect actor to play Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  He portrays the famous artist with a mixture of goffiness and perfectionist behavior.  Mel Gibson tried out for the role of Mozart.  He would have been wrong for the part because he could not give this role justice.  Elizabeth Berridge as Mrs. Mozart is a mature counterpoint to the gifted but immature Amadeus Mozart.
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Andy Kaufman have many things in common.  First, the two artists did things that were ahead of their time and not well received by everyone.  Second, both upset people with their antics, behavior, and manners.  Third, both were driven artists who wanted to be the best of their craft.  Finally, both died at the age of 35 and in tragic cercumstances.",Null,2,4,27 March 2001

Things goes out of wack for him when he is given a unique game as a birthday present by his younger brother.  There are scenes that are worthy of David Cronenberg.  The Game(1997) never loses its nerve wecking intensity and suspense for one second.  The direction is highly charged and well imagined.

Ghostbusters," Funny Lovecraftian Comedy
","An enjoyable SciFi-Comedy with a awesome job of comic timing by Bill Murray as Peter Venkman.  He plays his role with an irony that hasn't been seen since the days of Groucho Marx.  In fact, Ghostbusters(1984) is reminescent of the early films of the Marx Brothers.  Sigourney Weaver also gives a good performance as Dana, the woman who turns into a possessed demon.Ghostbusters is not as good as Stripes(1981), but is still an entertaining motion picture to watch.  This is one of the few movies that capture the style and flavor of H.P. Lovecraft with it's doorways to other diminisons, architecture, and set designs.  An interesting fact about Ghostbusters(1984) is it was a project originally meant for Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, and I believe that if Belushi didn't die that Bill Murray would have been in this feature film.  If there's anyone Bill Murray should thank for appearing in great comedies like this then it should be Chevy Chase for stepping down from Saturday Night Live.",Null,0,0,25 February 2000
The Evil Dead," Excellent Low Budget Horror
","The Most Serious of the three films in the popular horror trilogy.  For the most part a grim and straight forward horror picture.  Not bombarded with the unnecessary slapstick comedy that plagues Evil Dead 2(1987) and The Army of Darkness(1991).  Better and more scary because of its serious tone.  The Evil Dead(1982) was an innovative horror feature of the 1980s.
In my opinion its the best of the Evil Dead trilogy.  Has more pure horror than the sequels.  Ash is not portrayed like a member of the Three Stooges as in the following films.  Evil Dead(1982) is excellent in its atmospheric aura and fast moving cinematography.  Evil Dead(1982) also contains the coolest gore scenes in the entire trilogy.
The POV shots are used with such innovative bravado and technical efficiency.  The POV shots are in the manner of Dario Argento.  One of the first to use the shaky Cam effect.  The use of POV in Evil Dead would influence a number of film directors.  Sam Raimi is the best American filmmaker when it comes to POV shots.
Ash in the first Evil Dead is a tragic figure.  Here he is a far cry from the clumsy Comedic heroic figure of Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn(1987) and Army of Darkness(1991).  Ash in Evil Dead(1982) is tormented by the loss of his friends and girlfriend.  Ash is pretty much patterened after the main character of Sammo Hung's Encounters of the Spooky Kind(1980). Ash is a simpleton who fights to survive against the demons that possess his friends.
One of the best elements of this movie is the subplot involving Ash and his girlfriend, Linda.  Its this element as well as others that makes  The Evil Dead(1982) my favorite of the trilogy.  Bruce Campbell and Betsy Baker are wonderful in the scenes they do together.  Its heartbreaking and sad to see Ash dismember and kill a woman he loved so much.  The sequence where Ash gives Linda the necklace is one of the movie's lighter moments.
The humor is blended into the horror scenes without being overly ridculous. Evil Dead(1982) is full of dark humor that is both funny and scary.  Mixing horror and humor is a tricky thing to pull off because there has to be a balance for the combo to work.  The Evil Dead(1982) is successful in combining the two.  Fun to watch horror with humor as opposed to humor with horror.
Notorious for the rape in the woods scene, Evil Dead(1982) becomes a daring picture at this point of the film.  Scene like this separates the first from the next two as a masterful horror pic.  Ellen Sandweiss is very brave in going through with this scene.  A terrifying sequence to observe and watch. Sam Raimi reuses this scene in Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn(1987) without the absolute viciousness of the one here.
The gore here is fantasticly shown.  For a low budget film the make up effects are impressive.  Was not popular with the MPPA because of the extreme color used to portray blood.  The filmmakers use a stylish and crude appoarch to make the gore scenes work.  Joel Coen must have learned something about filming gore scenes from Evil Dead(1982) when he directed Blood Simple(1985).
The original title of Evil Dead(1982) was Book of the Dead.  The book and many ot the film's themes derieve from the horror and scifi stories of H.P. Lovecraft.  The big influence for Evil Dead(1982) was an early 1970s horror flick known as Equinox(1971).  An early movie Joel Coen worked on before going on to become a major director and do films like Blood Simple(1985), Miller's Crossing(1991), and Fargo(1996).  Shares many ideas with the Sammo Hung kung Fu horror pic, Spooky Encxounters(1980).
Some fabulous cinematography are used in most of the films' best scenes. Sam Raimi shows his talent in directing Evil Dead(1982) with his hyperkentic style.  Some areas of Evil Dead(1982) reminds me of the Lucio Fulci films from the early 80s, especially The Beyond(1981).  One of ten terrific horror features that came out in the 1980s.  Many have tried to copy the style of this movie and most have failed.",Null,1,2,18 July 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Just as Bad as the First for Different Reasons
","Mission:Impossible 2(2000) is the polar opposite of the first film.  The first film was overly complex while this one is overly simplex.  M:I1 relied on intrigue and mystery and M:I2 relies on action.  Tom Cruise was a by the book and clean cut agent in part one and he is a long haired anything goes type of agent in part two.
It surpasses Broken Arrow(1996) as one of John Woo's worst films.  His three worst films are 1.Blackjack(1998), 2.Mission:Impossible 2(2000), and Broken Arrow(1996).  The problem is that the action does not have the intensity of his top Hong Kong films.  I didn't expect the movie to be as emotionally stimulating or intensive as The Killer(1989), and Bullet in the Head(1990), but I did expect the film to be better then it was.
I give the director the benefit of the doubt because I read somewhere that the director wasn't able to make his kind of movie due to the interference of the actor/producer.  Tom Cruise is a good actor but he is not an action star.  Tom Cruise as with Christian Slater in Broken arrow(1996) proved that he do not have what it takes to be an action hero.  This is the second time that the actor was in a lousy film by an excellent director(the other time was with Martin Scorsese during the making of The Color of Money-1986).
M:I2 is a politically correct version of Notorious(1946) with shades of North by Northwest(1959).  Dougray Scott does ok as the main heavy.  The best sequence in the entire movie is the shootout in the lab.  I only wished that the film followed the team aspect of the show because its a concept that John Woo has dealt with before.
Antony Hopkins and Thandie Newton are wasted are wasted in this film.  Tom Cruise is not Cary Grant as that actor was cool and suave.  John Woo is a talented film maker but is not in the same level as Alfred Hitchcock.  For people interested in John Woo movies, I suggest films like Heroes Shed No Tears(1983) & Just Heroes(1987).",Null,0,1,21 September 2000

Some good performances are given by Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Corbin Bernsen, Rene Russo, and Wesley Snipes.

Many of the film's plot elements come from Mel Brooks's The Producers(1968). An entertaining and funny motion picture with some flaws in some areas.

Die Hard," Better Then Most Action flicks Made in Hollywood Today
","Die Hard(1988) has a very good story line but what it does contain is a feeling of entrapment and some mind bogging action sequences.  The one liners in this movie are very funny and done with a lot of style.  What makes this movie interesting is the violent chess match between Bruce Willis's John and Alan Rickman's Hans.  One thing I didn't understand about the film was why was the Japanese CEO killed and not tortured as he seemed willing to die in order for the terrorists to not get the information they wanted to know.
Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber is seen in the film as a very cultured and intelligent but dangerous person who is capable of anything.  Die Hard along with Die Hard 2:Die Harder are not only the best in the Die Hard trilogy but also one of the best actions films of the 1980's.  The protagonist is a complete and sympathetic character which is unusually for an action flick of this size.

Scream 2," Cow Manure
","Scream(1996) proved to be the major undoing of the Hollywood Horror film and Scream 2(1997) continues the trend of overrated and overbearing horror features in the USA.  This proves that most filmmakers in American today are clueless when it comes to making great horror films.  Scream 2(1997) begins on a good note but degenerates into a 2 hour repeat of the first film.  The opening scene in the movie theatre is a good homage to Lamberto Bava'a Demons(1985).  The acting overall is as lousy as the first film.  The movies of Dario Argento and Mario Bava may have had their share of flaws, but overall they almost always delievered something magnificent.
The first two Scream movies would have been wise to spent less time having the murderers behaving like failed stand up comics and more time making them into scary figures.  Neve Campbell gives the only decent performance of the feature.  Its a pity that she has to again run from her attacker until she is put in a corner.  The success of Kevin Williamson as a Horror Screenwriter must be a sign of the times.  I do not believe that he would have the same success in the late 1960's to mid 1980's because people had higher standards for horror films then.
Wes Craven has shown with his involvement in the Scream trilogy that he's a has been filmmaker.  At least movie makers like Dario Argento, George A. Romero, and David Cronenberg have not sold themselves out.  Scream 2(1997) plays its homage to the college theme slasher flicks of the early to mid 1980's.  It also rips off great Italian Giallos such as Torso(1973), Deep Red(1975), and Tenebre(1982).

In fact, his performance is an inspiration to the rest of the cast as they seem to feed off it.  It did a good job at showing the racial hatred and how it affects justice.

Scream," Over-rated Nonsense
","No matter what critics or anyone else say, I think that this film is not good at all.  The scary part about this film and the series is that it has probably made more money at box office then the unholy trinity of Italian Horror(Dario Argento, Mario Bava, & Lucio Fulci) has ever made in their life.  One problem is its poor attempt at being humorous.  Scream(1996) is a popular film because many people are desperate to see a well made horror film.  The acting is below average and technically, the movie is unimpressive and uninspired.
Its a shame that Wes Craven sold himself out to do this overbearing 'horror' film.  This was made for a generation of people who have no idea of what a great horror film is or what makes them scary.  The whole thing is formulatic and genetic when it comes to the movie itself.  I prefer the slasher flicks of the early 80's to this movie and its clones because they were filled with better murder scenes, more gore, and a lot more evil villains.  Scream(1996) is the film that will bring the near death experience of the horror genre.",2,5,14,10 April 2000
Halloween," From The Golden Era of Horror Films
","Halloween(1978) features a great POV shot at the beginning that's worthy of Argento.  The next comments are a summary of the opening murder scene. Opens in the year 1963 with an overview of a house.  The camera peeks near a window to watch a couple kissing(with the girl wondering where her brother is) who then going upstairs to make love.  The camera moves to the front of the house to look at an upper window(a light goes off).
The person who the camera represents moves to the side of the house and into the kitchen.  A hand turns on the kitchen lights and reaches inside a drawer for a knife.  The person waits until the young girl's boyfriend leaves the house and then goes upstairs.  The camera glides upstairs, picks up a mask of a clown, and heads for the young woman's room.  The person proceeds to stab the young woman to death and after the murder, the person is revealed to be the brother of the young woman.
Halloween's main reference is Psycho(1960).  The main actress is played by Janet Leigh's daughter's Jamie Lee Curtis.  Donald Pleasence's character is named after a major figure in Psycho(1960).  The murder of Judith Myers is a reworking of the shower scene in Psycho(1960).  Halloween and Psycho have nothing in common story wise with the exception of the horror element in the shower sequence.
Halloween(1978) is closer to Deep Red(1975) in style and tone.  Halloween was influenced by the pictures of Dario Argento and Mario Bava.  John Carpenter has acknowledged that Halloween was done as a homage to Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso(1975).  He even was influenced by the Goblin soundtrack.  The haunted Myers house is inspired by 'the house of the screaming child' in Deep Red(1975).
Another film that Halloween's origin lie in is Bob Clark's pre slasher pic, Black Christmas(1974).  The two films take place on a national holiday.  The two films have an opening ending.  Black Christmas(1974) has a killer that's elusive and unknown.  Black Christmas contains set pieces that would influence Halloween.
Halloween(1978) introduced a scary villain in Michael Myers.  Michael Myers as with the punks from Assault on Preceint 13 is a faceless killer that shows no remorse.  The mask that he wears is a way for him to not deal with the basic human emotions that make people good.  The unmasking of Michael Myers reveals someone who is human and scared while having the same expression after being unmasked at the end of the opening murder scene. Michael Myers would create a number of almost scariless murderers in many teen horror flicks.
Nick Castle as The Shape is menacing and scary.  Seeing a six year old boy kill someone must have been shocking to audiences during the time it was released.  This is something that many studios today would not show or even suggest.  The idea of a six year old boy as a murderer is the most daring aspect of the movie.  Has very little blood and more suspense compared to the sequels.
Its John Carpenter's most accomplished work and his most popular film. Halloween is also the director's best film.  Other terrific movies by John Carpenter are Assault on Preceint 13(1976), The Fog(1980), Escape from New York(1981), and The Thing(1982).  Laurie Strode is named after the director's first girlfriend.  Dean Cundey's cinematography is one of the top reasons to see Halloween(1978).
John Carpenter's direction is first class.  One of the few slasher pics that I really enjoy to watch.  The acting is very good compared to other slasher films of that period.  Jamie Lee Curtis brings intellegence and strength to her role of the heroine.  The long camera shot at the beginning of Halloween is influenced by the opening Crane shot of Touch of Evil(1958).
The mask worn by Michael Myers is a William Shatner mask from the film, The Devil's Rain.  Donald Pleasence was the third choice behind Chris Lee and Peter Cushing for the role of Dr. Loomis.  Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing would have been perfect choices for Dr. Loomis had they choose to star in Halloween(1978).  Donald Pleasence lends his experience among a cast of unknowns.

","Carrie(1976) opens with a moment that would set the tone for the rest of the story.  Moment in the shower represents an open awareness of the main character's sexuality and her confusion.  De Palma builds and builds the moment with an effectiveness that never quiets down.  Sissy Spacek conveys emotions of confusion and hysteria powerfully depicted by her facial expressions.  A moment when you can feel pity for Carrie White because of the mean treatment she receives from classmates.
Before Carrie(1976), Brian De Palma was known for his forays into comedies with exception of Sisters(1973), and Obsession(1976).  After Carrie(1976), De Palma started to become famous for his horror/thriller features, which displayed many homages to his fave direrctor, Alfred Hitchcock as well as Dario Argento, and Mario Bava.  He may not be original when it comes to some of his storylines, but at his best makes things entertaining and interesting.  The Prom massacre scene is directed with some finesse, although it does feel at times that he goes overboard with the split-screen effects.  The genius of Carrie(1976) is to depict the emotional meltdown of a young woman who is tormented from all sides and fronts.
An intriquing look into the behavior and mind set of the teenager and the difficulties that comes with being one.  The performances in the film are quite convincing in showing the cruel and nasty nature that teens who are outsiders go through every day of their life.  Carrie White is portrayed in a sympathetic light whose hidden feelings of anger can be understandable. Chris Hargensen(played by Nancy Allen) is a character you love to hate because of her mean attitude towards Carrie White.  Probably the meanest and most unpleasent character Nancy Allen has played in film.
One of the best film adaptations from a Stephen King book besides The Dead Zone(1983), and Misery(1990).  Definitely introduced the world to the writings of King, and ended up making a household name out of him as a writer of horror literature.  The film plays a nice homage from a moment in Deliverance(1972) during the final moments of Carrie(1976).  The Prom massacre is one of the scariest moments in horror films that would be reworked into the final scene in Ms. 45(1981).  A classic 1970s horror pic that hasn't lost its touch in creating something so frightening, and very much heart chilling.",Null,36,58,17 September 2002
The Sixth Sense," Implicit Ghost Story
",Bruce Willis is in one of his most mature roles of his career as Dr. Malcolm Crowe.  M.Night Shyamalan shows some promise as one of the first great horror filmmakers of the 21th Century.  It came around the same time as the Blair Witch Project(1999) and in my opinion is a better film.  Its more effective at utilizing the psychological aspects of implicit and suggestive horror.  This was the second film that Bruce Willis played a doctor who suffers a traumatic experience at the start of the film(the other feature was The Color of Night{1994}).  Haley Joel Osment gives the most convincing performance of a young kid since Heather O'Rourke talked to the TV people in Poltergeist(1982).  The Sixth Sense is like a puzzle box that needs to be viewed more then once.  The color red plays a major importance in the roles of the ghosts.  Olivia Williams is lovely as the sad Mrs. Crowe.  The Sixth Sense(1999) has the most surprising ending that I've have seen since the unmasking of the mysterious villain in The Usual Suspects(1995).,Null,0,0,1 November 2000
The Producers," One of the Funniest Films of the Last 35 Years
","The Producers(1968) has three things that make it a pleasurably funny film. One, the humorous interreactions between Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel.  Two, the film's memorable and unforgettable 'Springtime for Hitler' musical number.  Three, the energetic and fresh style of the filmmaker, Mel Brooks.
Mel Brooks does a fantastic job in his masterful film debut as film director.  Blends the crude humor of Blazing Saddles(1974) with the subtleness of Young Frankenstein(1974).  Brooks's direction is daring and isn't afraid to use material that might be a little risque.  I believe Mel Brooks direction in The Producers(1968) is excellent and surpassed only by his more mature direction for Young Frankenstein(1974).
The screenplay is terrificly good for a comedy of this kind.  Perhaps the best written film by Mel Brooks in his directorial career.  Boasts some original lines of dialogue and strange situations.  The film's screenplay received an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay(too bad The Producers[1968] wasn't considered for Best Picture or Best Director).
Gene Wilder was the best alter ego as actor to Mel Brooks as director.  He was in the director's three top films and that is no accident because Gene Wilder always added more laughs to the films of Mel Brooks in which he was in.  The Mel Brooks pictures where Gene Wilder wasn't in lose a lot with the lack of his presence.  In my opinion Gene Wilder worked with Mel Brooks in a way the director has not worked with anyone before or since.
The characters of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are opposites in personalities yet they make a perfect duo.  The two leads give brilliant performances in their roles of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom.  Two is a number that plays an important role in many of the Mel Brooks films.  In his films there is a leader and an assistent whose plans never work as originally envisioned.
A satire on planned failure and unintentional success that was daring for its time.  Deals with how a bad or below average product can be popular due to good fortune.  In the film, Max and Leo attempt to produce a failure on Boardway to collect the insurance.  To their chargin the play becomes a big time success.
The main idea of the story was eeriely prophetic because today there are many lousy films that are big box office successes.  The Producers(1968) message was that people will go to see anything even if the product isn't very good or excellent.  Its funny to see how truthful The Producers(1968) was in portraying a certain element of human nature.  To see films like Blair Witch Project(1999) or other lousy big hit films become successes shows that The Producers(1968) in one way was ahead of its time.
I have no intention of watching the Boardway play based on the film for several reasons.  One, the actors in the play do not bring the same type of humor or style of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.  Two, the story worked much better when written during the late 1960s.  Three, anything that has been inspired from film into Boardway usually turns out to be not very good at all.
Kenneth Mars rounds out the main cast in a hilarious turn as Franz Liebkind. One of the best sequences is when Max flirts with old women to get their money.  The final scene is another brilliant moment in The Producers(1968). The set designs are beautifully constructed and visually depicted.
William Hickly makes an obscure appearence in a film before his breakthrough role in Prizzi's Honor(1985).  The Producers(1968) is Mel Brooks at his best and most enthusiastic.  I can tell the film was made in the late 1960s because of the manners and style of the characters.  A classic comedy made at a time when the cinema took chances and weren't afraid to use its artistic freedom to the fullest extent.",Null,7,9,16 August 2001
Final Destination," Sleeper
","Final Destination(2000) is a very good film that was brutally cut and hurt by the censors.  Has its weaknesses including the lame ending.  One of the two alternative endings should have been used because the film would have been much better.  Inspired by the style of The X Files with the tone of Scream.
The dream sequence during the opening moments are nightmarishly portrayed. The scene where Alex Browning sweats it out and exists the plane only to see the plane blow up in mid air reminds me of a scene in Get Shorty(1995) where there is a similar sitution.  What the film says is that you cannot escape your destiny no matter what course of action you take.  This was something that was also important in the Lucio Fulci Giallo, Seven Notes in Black(1977).
Final Destination(2000) is in my opinion the best film in the post Scream explosion because there is an attempt at creativity.  The special effects in the film are some of the best in late 1990s teen horror films.  The death scenes are reminiscent of the glory days of Dario Argento, Mario Bava, and Lucio Fulci.  I hope that there will be a director's cut of Final Destination released on DVD just to see how better the film would be.
The death sequence involving the teacher is the highlight of the film.  The actors perform decently as the pawns who try to escape death.  Final Destination(2000) uses ideas from Don't Look Now(1972), Seven Notes in Black(1977), The Eyes of Laura Mars(1978), & The Dead Zone(1983).  Final Destination(2000) was competently directed by X-Files member, James Wong.",Null,1,3,2 April 2001
Rear Window," Classic Hitchcock
","Rear Window(1954) in its restored edition is better than ever with improvements made with the look and sound of the film.  It is Alfred Hitchcock's second great film right after Vertigo(1958).  Rear Window was Alfred Hitchcock's first box office hit.  The colors of the movie are fresher and make the movie seem brand new.
Alfred Hitchcock's top five movies are 1.Vertigo(1958), 2.Rear Window(1954), 3.Psycho(1960), 4.The Birds(1963), and 5.North By Northwest(1959).  It is filled with terrific scenes of suspense and nerve wecaking mystery.  James Stewart is great as usual as a curious photographer.  Thelma Ritter adds some morbid humor to the film with her dialogue.
My ten favorite Hitchcock films are 1.Strangers on a Train(1951), 2.Notorious(1946), 3.The 39 Steps(1934), 4.Vertigo(1958), 5.Rear Window(1954), 6.The Birds(1963), 7.Frenzy(1972), 8.North By Northwest(1959), 9.Rope(1948), and 10.Marnie(1964).  Raymond Burr is menacing as the mysterious salesman.  The protagonist is someone who likes to look into the lives of his fellow neighboors.  Grace Kelly is alluing as Jeffery's girlfriend.
Rear Window(1954) deals with the theme of voyeurism although without the explicit nature of Michael Powell's Peeping Tom(1960) which took a more extreme viewpoint.  This movie is filled with Hitchcock humor.  This is a film that will stand the test of time as all great movies eventually do.  It is best to see it on the big screen because it is the best way to View Rear Window(1954).",Null,1,3,27 March 2000
Casino," The Best Movie of 1995
","Casino(1995) is a fascinating and terrific behind the scenes look at the mob undergoings in Las Vegas during the 1970's and early 80's.  It deals with things that were hinted at in The Godfather(1972).  Casino(1995) received mixed reviews during its release which was due to ignorance from most film critics.  This film is one of the reasons why Martin Scorsese is the best film-maker of his generation.The opening credits are beautifully done using colors to a greater effect. Casino(1995) is a film that was most deserving of a Best Picture award in 1995.  It should be considered as one of the top films of the 1990's. This is an another example of Martin Scorsese being done in by the Academy Award voters as he should have at least five Best Director[Mean Streets(1973, Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)], and six Best Picture awards[Mean Streets(1973), Taxi Driver(1976), Raging Bull(1980), The Last Temptation of Christ(1988), Goodfellas(1990), and Casino(1995)].
The infamous 'Batting Practice' scene near the end of the film is one of the five most brutal and vicious sequences in a Scorsese Flick.  The first part of the film are a summary of events and the narrative does not begin until twenty minutes into the story.  Its filled with multiple voice overs from Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Frank Vincent.  It was written by the same man who wrote Goodfellas(1990).Casino(1995) takes a look at the upper level mafia as Goodfellas(1990) looked into the lives of low to mid level hoods.  This film deals with the themes of excess, greed, power, and self-destruction.  Like in other Scorsese films, the violence here is sudden and comes out unexpectively. Robert De Niro as Sam is at odds between being loyal to his bosses and retaining some kind of intregity.There are a few scenes that were really masterful.  One, the scene where Sam explains the different roles of the people working at the casino.  Two, the murders during the climax of the movie. Three, introductions of the main and minor characters in the story.One asset of this movie is Scorsese's Utilization of music used to fit many scenes and situations.  It deals with the end of an era when the mob controlled Las Vegas.  The camera is always on the move as well as being fluid and steady.  The difference between this film and Scorsese's early works is this film doesn't have the gritty of of his 1970s films.Casino(1995) is one of Martin Scorsese's three or four best films of the 1990's and that includes Goodfellas(1990), The Age of Innocence(1993), and Kundun(1998).  Casino was the eighth coraboration between Scorsese & De Niro.  Many scenes(gory ones) were cut from this feature in order to avoid an NC-17 rating.  Casino follows in the tradition of gangster epics ala, The Godfather(1972), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Scarface(1983), Once Upon A Time in America(1984), and Goodfellas(1990).One of the film's best lines is 'Before she could start counting her money, the bosses back home decided to settle the case out of court, so they sent me'.  Everyone contributes to the excellent acting in Casino.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her life.  In my opinion, Sam Rothstein represents Martin Scorsese and the mob bosses symbolizes the Hollywood execs.Casino is more a big budget lavish Independant film then it is a mainstream feature.  Robert De Niro as Sam plays him with unusual restraint espically for Robert De Niro.  Joe Pesci plays a more psychotic version of Tommy De Vito of Goodfellas(1990).  After getting brutally beaten by a Pesci character in Raging Bull(1980), and Goodfellas(1990), Frank Vincent finally gets a chance to return the favor.Scorsese directs with the craft of an experienced pro.  Sam Rothstein is based on career of professional bookie Frank'lefty' Rosenthal.  This would be the final appearence of the mother of Martin Scorsese in one of his movies.  Casino(1995) as many years pass is a movie that will be acknowledged as one of the director's all time greats.",Null,6,10,26 April 2000
Heat," Cops & Robbers Epic
","It is an overlooked film with a top notch cast and a terrific story.  This exhibits that Michael Mann is a great specialist of crime dramas.  Its an emotional thriller that deals with the everyday lives of the main characters.  Most of the actors including Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer, Natalie Portman, and the rest of the cast gave out fine performances.
De Niro like in many of his films really becomes his character in this movie.  The only problem with this film is that it tried to focus too much on two different characters equally.  I would've liked to see Heat(1995) done as a companion piece to Thief(1981)(focus mainly on the life and work of a policeman the way that Thief(1981) focused on the life and job of a burglar). This is the only film to date where Robert De Niro and Al Pacino do a few scenes together.",Null,0,0,21 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Movie Mythology
","Star Wars(1977) has been adored by audiences from its opening night in 1977 to its special edition release in 1997.  Star Wars is the film that changed the cinema and ushered in a new era of mega blockbuster features.  The only negative aspect is that Star Wars(1977) as with Jaws(1975) brought about the end of creative and risk taking filmmaking that was essential to films of the early 1970's(thus ending the last golden period in film history to date{1967-1977}).  This unfortunately brought upon an era of greed in which studios are more interested in piling in loads of cash then in creating bold and great works of film.
Star Wars(1977) is superior to Episode one because in a way the characters are more fully realized.  Another reason the film is better then Episode one is there is a fresh appoarch to the material with a sense of wonder that's missing from the latest film.  Also, The Phantom Menance does not have a character like Han Solo to contrast some of the main characters.  Finally, The Phantom Menance seems like a soulless machine while Star Wars(1977) is filled with energy and wisdom.
Like other filmmakers, George Lucus was influenced by John Ford's The Searchers(1956).  Another film that influenced the director is Akira Kurosawa's Kakushi Toride no Sanakunin/The Hidden Fortress(1958).  This is the director's masterpiece of his short director filmography.  The battle scenes leading up to the descruction of the Death Star are breath taking.
Harrison Ford is both cocky and dashing as the smuggler, Han Solo.  Star Wars(1977) is an entertaining movie to view.  Its amazing that George Lucus had trouble getting funding to make the first Star Wars film.  Alex Guiness and Peter Cushing act professionally in their prospective roles.",Null,0,0,27 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Best of Stars Wars Trilogy
","More complex approach into the realm of good and evil than Episode four. Empire Strikes Back(1980) is filled with a machine of emotions that lead its characters and main plot.  Emotions and feelings of Luke, Han, and Leia are developed to the point where they are multi-dimensional as people.  Yoda gives Luke Skywalker tests which are based on emotions that can lead him either on the good or the dark side.
Dark tale about the nature of the dark side, and of human nature itself. Pessemistic film that goes from one desperate situtation to another for the rebels, especially Han, Luke, and Leia.  Excells from not having nice, friendly, childish environment like others in Star Wars films.  Instead it focuses on the character development improved from the first film, and the approaching sense of hopelessness faced by the three main heros.
The acting in Empire Strikes Back(1980) in my opinion is muched improved compared to the first film.  Mark Hamill as Luke although still shows slight tendencies of annoyance, these tendencies are few and far between.  He achieves a level of maturity in playing Luke especially in transforming him to a tragic character who has to face the truth the hard way.  Alex Guiness as the ghost of Luke's mentor, and in essence surrogate father, Obi Wan Kenobi, is a class act in his performance.
The evolving love story between Han Solo and Leia is credible, fatalistic, and romantic at the same time.  Unlike in The Phantom Menace, where the impending love story is presented in a sappy and stupid fashion, the love between Han and Leia gives the viewer something touchingly romantic.  The moment when they kiss before they are separated as Han is about to face a tragic fate is highly tragicly emotional.  One of the many great attributes that the film has to offer, and delivers in deep way.
The opening scenes in the snow are fantastic, and the landscapes are shown with beauty, and remarkable skill by director.  The battle moments are especially impressive and without a sense of staleness unlike battle scenes in other Star Wars films.  The scene where Luke escapes from the Abominable Snowman like creature escalates the suspense mode to a high measure.  The fight against the walking tall animal like battleship machines are cherographed with excellence.
Empire Strikes Back(1980) deals with facing fears and learning how to control them.  That is the basic essence which, is carried out to a t by Irvin Kershner.  Interested in human nature and the surprises which comes with what a person may learn about oneself or another closely linked to him/her.  One of many interesting ideas explored by George Lucus, and director, Irvin Kershner that is pushed into the storyline with complex ideas on the mystery of the human spirit.
The Empire Strikes Back(1980) is the best of the Stars Wars films for a few reasons.  First, George Lucus did not direct it so in a way it was strenghten by someone who could do things with the film that Lucus wouldn't do had he directed.  Second, doesn't have any chracter that is annoying or nonusefull, except for the former I would have to say A2D2, but only for a brief moment.  Third, has characters to actually believe in and a storyline that's isn't just there to please a children section of an audience.
Harrison Ford's performance as Han Solo in Empire Strikes Back(1980) is majorly improved over the one in Star Wars(1977).  In two years, Harrison Ford appeared in dark films...I.E, Empire Strikes Back(1980), and Blade Runner(1992) which contain a few of his best and interesting roles.  The scene where Luke is given a test and is taken aback when he finds out the practrice Darth Valder he kills, is himself is my favorite scene in the entire film.  Inspired a similar notion in the samurai dream sequence of Terry Gilliam's Brazil(1985).  The last film Howard Hawks writer, Leigh Brackett got involved in a motion picture before her death in 1980.
The surprise twist that is revealed near the ending took me by shock in a grand way the first time I saw the film.  Even today although the shock value of it has lessen, the magnitude of the moment hasn't.  Gives the plot a fatalistic and tragic quality, which is lacking from the other Star Wars movies.  The surprise twist is about finding out something dark and unwelcomed about something, and dealing to learn how to deal with it.
One actor who has a breif cameo in Empire Strikes Back(1980) is Treat Williams.  The body of David Prowse and the voice of James Earl Jones combine to make one impressionable imposingly memorable screen villain. Carrie Fisher does an alright job in the role of Leia.  The direction is the best in the series, and the camera work is nothing less than fabulous.",Null,0,0,14 February 2002

Christopher Lloyd is wacky as the eccentric scientist, Dr. Brown. There is a scene in this movie that is inspired by Terry Gilliam's Brazil(1985).

","After seeing the film for the first time I realized that it was nothing but Westworld with dinosaurs.  If you take out the robots and replace them with geneticly created dinosaurs then you have the movie Jurassic Park.  A few items that Jurassic Park(1993) borrows from Westworld.  The idea of a spectecular theme park that is to bring out the child in tourists. Something goes wrong and the exhibits of the theme park turn on its creators and anyone else that's around there.  The heroes overcome the exhibits and barely flee with their lives.  Although I wasn't impressed with this movie I did find it more entertaining to watch than the sequel The Lost World(1997). Attempts to do for dinosaurs what Jaws did for sharks.  Wasn't as good as Jaws(1975) because at least in that film there were genuine attempts to create suspense, tension, and terror.  The direction is average for the talents of Steven Spielberg.  The cinematography is excellent for an average film.  Sam Neill plays in his fourth genre film besides Possession(1981), Omen 3:The Final Conflict(1981), and Event Horizon(1997).  The rest of the acting ranges from over the top to very good.",Null,2,4,18 May 2001
The Godfather," Modern Gangster Classic
","The Godfather(1972) helped resurrect a low budget genre known as the gangster genre and turned it into a major film genre for the next two decades.  Many people found a new way in speaking to each other by watching this film.  In fact many members of organized crime in the USA began to pattern themselves right after the characters in the film.  The gangster genre would become one of the most popular genres to come out of Hollywood since the end of Film Noir in 1958.
The film deals more with the joys and sorrows of an mafia family then with what they do for a living.  You can identify with many characters from the film because many people also go through almost similar problems in life. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo contribute to give some excellent story telling visually.  Marlon Brando gives a very good performance as the head of the family, Vito Corleone.
There are many memorable moments in this film.  One, the Wedding scene at the beginning of the movie.  Two, the Sollozzo-McCluskey murder sequence. Finally, the death of Vito Corleone.
The Godfather's success would spawn many classic gangster flicks including Mean Streets(1973), The Godfather Part 2(1974), Once Upon a Time in America(1984), Goodfellas(1990), and Donnie Brasco(1997).  Also influences filmmakers ranging from Martin Scorsese to Abel Ferrara and John Woo to Takeshi Kitano.  Sergio Leone was at one point offered to direct The Godfather(1972) but turned it down.  I believe that The Godfather(1972) would be just as good if in the hands of a genius like Sergio Leone.
Al Pacino gives a terrific performance as the youngest son, Michael.  James Caan gives the best performance of the film despite his role as a supporting actor.  Frank Sinatara was considered for the role of Johnny the singer but didn't get it because the role was too close to home for the famed singer. Robert Duvall is outstanding as the lawyer for the Corleone family, Tom Hagan",Null,2,4,13 February 2001
