The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Not your typical clich√©...Much more to it...
","It started out as a normal, no-one-notices-me-teen-movie. But as it went on I was surprised to find that it wasn't anything like that. There's so much more to it, and after I watched the movie I immediately went and read the book. The movie was according to me way better. And usually any adaption lacks a lot of things. Perks, has no lacking whatsoever.Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson, is definitely a trio to be reckoned with and showed no flaw in any of their performances they portray the typical teenager, perfectly. Each character has something to them, each their own baggage that they struggle to cope with and that was another reason why I loved this movie, the complexity was great.There's a saying that goes, 'the plot thickens,' after you've watched this movie, you'll see. That those words are a definite understatement.",10,0,1,3 August 2013
The Hunger Games," Not bad, But I liked the books more...
","Hunger Games...Well, I was glad that I read the books before I watched the movie, but the movie didn't disappoint me. I was actually amazed at how true they stayed to the book. Jennifer Lawrence, is as always amazing, in her portrayal of Katniss Everdeen and I found Josh Hutcherson pretty good as Peeta Mellark.It just felt like some one told them, 'you've got two hours to give as much info as as possible.' I think that they also could've made it a little more violent (cause the book certainly is). But it's really not that bad,for some one who read the book it'll be easier to follow the story ass some one who doesn't have a clue what it's about.",10,2,9,6 July 2013
The Impossible," A Beautiful Story...
","Firstly let me say no other movie about a natural disaster unsettled me as much as this one. It fully captured the effect and the aftermath of this terrible event.I really found no problem with this movie. I had to wipe my eyes from time to time, thanks to the raw and passionate performances the actors gave.It is the story about a family torn apart by a tsunami that hit the eats coast of Asia in the year 2004 and how they desperately try to get back together again. With overwhelming odds and obstacles we can only imagine they find there way back to each other.In the end we can learn many things from this experience, but one stands out the most. That we should treasure each other whenever we can and we should never allow anything to get in the way of that. Be thankful for the people in your life because they can be taken away at any moment. If you have someone or something to live for you need to know that that something is worth fighting for.A beautiful story that had me captivated from beginning to the end. I couldn't take my eyes off the damn thing!",10,0,2,29 December 2013
Dead Poets Society," An instant OBSESSION...Unforgettable!!!!!!!!!!!
","Never in my life have I ever experienced anything like Dead Poet's Society.This is a fine example how movies should be. It should be touching, it should be funny, it should be something an outsider can be proud of. And I was...I was proud of what they accomplished, that almost decades later it can still be seen as a drama worth beating (and none has beaten it so far).The story is about a group of boys who restart an old Poets club, that was once run by their English teacher, mister John Keating. During the course of the film we are introduced to Keating's majorly uplifting influence in the lives of the boys as he urges them on to follow their dreams and to, seize the day. CARPE DIEM!!! This movie had me hooked from beginning to end. I didn't want it to end. When it was finished I let out a breath of relief as I realized I was not actually part of the fun. But it pulled me in and forced me to feel what the boys were feeling.The acting was phenomenal. The story is timeless and the lessons learned from it, I will always treasure.'Oh captain, my captain. I tip my hat to you sir. WELL DONE.'",10,0,0,3 August 2013
Man of Steel," Consider my Mind Blown
","Zack Snyder is a revelation, not only did he make a movie that's beautiful to look at, but he gave a fresh look at the legendary hero he know and love. THAT IS SUPERMAN!I am a huge Amy Adams fan and anything Zack Snyder is always amazing. This is definitely the best Superman movie to date, one that I think will go down as a classic.We are introduced to Clark Kent when he leaves Krypton as a baby and where he grows up in Smallville and all the situations he was in, where he saved numerous lives. In the end he has to save earth from a evil that has come to destroy it, to create a new Krypton.The acting from Henry Cavill gave me chills, and I am so glad they've gotten Superman a new suit! I was so blown away after I watched this movie, that I had to calm myself down afterward. That's just it, this movie is so engaging and so in a way 'real' that you can't help but be sucked in. The special effects are breath taking and the acting is spot-on!Do yourself a favor and go watch this film. Don't try and make sense of it cause then you'll miss the whole point behind this beautiful movie. If you don't like it then I personally think there's something wrong with you. There's something for everyone.I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,3,12,11 July 2013
Moulin Rouge!," Spectacularly-passionate
","Phenomenal doesn't even come close to describing Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece. If you haven't yet watched Moulin Rouge! I want to ask you one question, 'What's Wrong with you?' It's a story about a love like none other, about two people that fall in love no matter the consequences. I loved Nicole Kidman as Satine, her voice gave me goose bumps. Ewan McGregor really surprised me. I never knew he could sing, and he was really good. All that I didn't like was the end, it was so tragic...I loved every minute of the Moulin Rouge! not once was I bored or even asleep. If you want to watch a movie that basically just about love and the power of love, this is a must see. Then I know you'll love it.",10,0,2,7 July 2013
August Rush," The Beauty of Life Captured in a Beautiful Movie!!!
","This is one movie that, it doesn't matter how many times I watch it I can't stop loving it more. The casting was spot on, Keri Russell, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Robin Williams...enough said. And this is one of Freddie Highmore's earlier movies, but one that he'll be remembered for, for the rest of his life.What director Kristen Sheridan and Writers Nick Castle and James V. Hart did was incredible, they didn't only tell a beautiful story, but they gave meaning to music, they made us realize that there are forces that bind families, and that it doesn't matter where you as a child is, your mother and father are always thinking of you.And the way they made everything work out in the end made it even more heart-warming.The emotion and passion that flares this film is what makes it such a damn good movie. It is driven by love, love for each other, love for music and the love between a mother and her son.Do yourself a favor: if you want to watch a beautiful movie, that has good acting, that doesn't require concentration, and that can make you feel good this is the one.August Rush...I am in AWE!",10,0,0,11 May 2014
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Consider my mind...not blown...Demolished...
","The entire year I've been waiting for this moment when The Hunger Games: Catching Fire would come out and I would go and see it. I had so many expectations going into the theater; was it going to be better than the first? Did they put everything that was in the book in the movie? Is it going to be worth it? Well I am pleased to say that the answer to all these questions are yes. This movie is by far one of the best franchise movies to date...Go suck it Twilight. Hunger Games Rule!! The acting was amazing, Jennifer Lawrence...I am in love, I don't know where she came from but she's from out of this world. They could not have casted a better Katniss, this girl it on fire! Josh Hutcherson might have grown up a bit and his portrayal of Peeta Mellark was outstanding. The rest was awesome, the victory tour, the parties, the tributes parade, the tributes, the arena, the obstacles in the arena, the CGI was memorable, and the emotion that these actors brought to the set was unforgettable.It's way better than the first one. And I'm so glad they did this one justice. I wish I could give this movie a fifteen out of ten, because it's just fantastic.If the second one was this good...then I cannot wait for Mockingjay Part 1 and Part 2. It's gonna be epic...",10,168,338,21 November 2013
Easy A," Worth-While!!!
","What we have here is according to me one of Emma Stone's best movies (and there are many more...she rules). I watched this movie about five times now and I find the characters extremely likable and the passion Emma puts in her performance made it worth-while. I'm really happy with the quality of teen movies Hollywood brings to us these days. This is just one of those, and being a teen myself I could identify all the situations in this movie with those that are in my own life. A fun, funny, sad, touching movie meant to be seen before you die. A must see for anyone who are fans of Struck By Lightning; I love You, Beth Cooper; Pitch Perfect and any teen movie out there. Loads of fun!!!",10,3,4,6 July 2013
Gladiator," Legendary Doesn't Even Describe This Movie! I am entertained!
","Rome, Gladiators, War and the battle of a warrior longing for freedom to one day return to his wife and son.This is probably by far my favorite Russell Crowe movie, and has one of the greatest liners ever 'are you not entertained!' What we have here is an instant classic. One I'll be showing my kids one day. They will know the story of Maximus. His struggle, and later, his victory.Not only is it wonderfully acted, but it is so engrossing that you don't even realize that two hours of you life just went out the door. I say two and a half hours well spent.I have to applaud Ridley Scott on this one. You made a good one, keep it up. Because there aren't other movies out there like Gladiator. It's one of a kind!Moving, tragic, and over all one hell of a show!!!",10,1,2,11 May 2014
