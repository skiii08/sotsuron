Hereditary," Amazing
","Amazing film, dripping in delicious horror throughout. Eerie, understated and atmospheric, yet not afraid to really torture its characters in ways that seem both cruel, inevitable, and almost tragic. For me, the relationship between the family was drenched in more horror elements that really stuck compared to the supernatural elements. Despite this, the film combined both elements to a shockingly effective degree, never letting the tension loosen. It terrorizes the concept of an innate hatred that can stew between family members and the never-ending resentments that build with it. The ending alone is fantastic, but the slow-brew of a film does a fine job keeping you both guessing, worried and entrenched in a horrific little story. Amazing acting from a tight ensemble case that redefines Annie as the ultimate movie final girl / monster. Def recommend",10,0,2,27 May 2020
