Conquest 1453," Must watch!
","We can see here some of commentators are accusing the director of film for presenting the history wrong. We can also see they are all Greek and cant accept the truth. If we search this event, it s fact that film s not enough about showing the Greeks real behaviors during the siege. After all Faith Sultan Mehmet Han ( Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror ) showed his mercy to public of Constantinople, as shown in the movie. This movie is shortly telling us an incredible conquest of the Turks. There is no better movie taken like this explaining the conquest of Istanbul. This event is so important, closing an age n opening a new age. We might say why a better one haven't taken before. Everyone want to tell their own and rightful story. It s so simple like that.",10,11,29,30 October 2012
