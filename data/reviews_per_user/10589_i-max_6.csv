Alien 3," SO BAD I HATE IT
","Every few years I take out the blurays and rewatch the Alien anthology, got the ratings memorized already that Alien3---not as good as 1 or 2. But I realize this time it gets badder and badder everytime I watch 3, simply can't tolerate the stupidity and empty script of the second half!",5,0,1,20 March 2020
Passengers," Watch it in 4K to appreciate it
","Just watched it in 4K and I have to say my impression of the film now is a lot better than the first time I watched it in 1080p. The scene and setup is just stunning, every angle you discover something new with details and that makes their love story more believable if they're to stuck on that ship for so long, you feel what they feel through the details of the scenes, very good job here.During the ending part of the movie where she was trying to resuscitate him was one of the best acting by Lawrence I've seen, and it couldn't have done it without good editing, really felt the suspense.What I didn't like about the film the first time I saw it was there seems to be too much focus/attention built towards selling the two main actors. The movie poster says it a lot, what would people think if you put two of the hottest most popular actors of the era together and lock them in a confined space, what would happen. The problem is if viewers don't like these 2 then they have no urge to watch the movie, and it's a loss because the movie isn't really about them.Now to the stuff I think it's ridiculous:
1. Hibernation for 120yrs without stops in between, at least design a protocol to check on everybody every 10-20yrs, as in wake up, make sure everybody is okay, then go back to hibernation. The passengers don't need to wake up, but the crew does. And they should have a pod to do the hibernation, consider they have spare parts for everything on the ship but they don't have the one most important thing.
2. Civilians can't know how to fix the damn ship.
3. What a coincidence that the only crew member who's useful to fix the ship dies. His whole purpose I guess is to give Jim his wristband.
4. To leave earth and abandon all your families friends behind you'd be pronounced DEAD. Why not just clone some people and send them over on the long journey, awfully expensive too.
5. Last, the whole point of migration is because Earth is too crowded, but it's not explained what would happen once they have established the new colony with just 5000 people, does it mean they plan to ship more and more volunteers to the new planet so Earth can somehow resolve the population crisis? Wouldn't that take a million years? By that time I think mars would already be inhabitable, why travel so far.Overall entertaining movie, do not take it seriously.",7,0,0,14 May 2020
Us," Hard to sit through...
","First 30mins was intriguing, then it went downhill wishing all of them would just give up and die...I didn't like the characters at all, especially the father, absolutely arrogant and useless. He makes you think he's the when-chips-are-down-guy, but he's not, he just limps when the chips are down. Buys a crappy boat that saved his lucky ass, always gets attacked from behind is hilarious. On the other hand, he's the comedian of the movie.The mother is kind of a freak, overreacting all the time. This is the type of person that can easily loses a child on the beach and not use her head in the first place.The girlfriend of the mother is another silly weirdo, has a bad marriage and an unlistening husband gets you killed in your own house, in front of your brand new land rover.The girl can't outrun her evil self who was basically walking the whole time. When in front of the car and her evil self disappears, her first reaction wasn't to keep running but to get on the ground like she was playing tag. I mean, what can she even do once they get physical contact?I have nothing to say about the boy, other than the closet scene I forgot everything he did in the movie.Bad twist at the end, you would need an alternate ending for it to make some sense. Writing this makes me realize the movie doesn't make sense at all, bad plot. Out of respect for the director I give a 5, it's creepy enough for a thriller film, only if there was a better plot or at least a better reason for the doppleganger to exist, then it would be a re-watchable movie.",5,1,1,27 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not easy to ruin Star Wars but seems did it.
","Almost fell asleep at the end not knowing when the movie will end or how it's going to end. There's a lot of twists in every outcome. The original plan was to get the Codebreaker, without even making eyecontact they get locked up, and team up with a new dude who turns out to be a fraud, like Disney who only cares about 'business'. There were some extraordinary scenes and landscapes, but too much twists as people don't know what's a Jedi anymore, they're all illusionists.Don't want to talk about it anymore, the other comments covers pretty well. In the next film I'm prepared to be flattered.",3,11,14,30 March 2018
It Chapter Two," 6 points, disappointing
","The beginning was classic, and later ever since they split up to find artifacts it's just too long of waiting and watch the small stories merge into a big story. Which the big showdown at the end was disappointing, you can taunt your way of the clown? That's what it all takes? You have smart people turning into dumb people, with cliches and such.",6,0,1,21 November 2019
Creed II," Worst one yet
","Like many people are saying -there's no soul in this one. I agree with most of the negative comments, it is bad, this guy is like a baby, no greatness in him.",3,1,3,15 April 2019
