3:10 to Yuma," Video game reality at it's most obvious
","Wow. I am coming to the shocking reality that most of the voters on this site must be children. To give this picture 8 stars on average? Are you kidding me? Is common virtue and morality to get completely stolen from the original 1957 version, and a reward to follow? Yeah, the entire good vs bad format for construction of reality is missing from this one too. Not that the film-makers have'nt got certain skills in special effects and technical editing. But, come on!! Bad gets rewarded. Plus the film is so full of plot holes as to defy common celluloid. Believe me, if you want to go to a virtual reality video theater, this film is for you. The action sequences are ridiculous. It could not have happened in a zillion years like this. The typical 10,000 near misses and just barely(s). This kind of video game reality is too absurd to accept as a workable paradigm for constructive entertainment. Nor, for me at least, is it to be construed as anything other than basic junk.",4,1,2,15 March 2009
Legends of the Fall," Turn of the century western of Americana
","This is quite an excellent film. Anthony Hopkins anchors a fine cast to the tarmac of the Montana pre-world-war I countryside with an epic fatherly performance as Colonel William Ludlow. Ludlow has 3 sons, who are raised to be real men sometime before, during, and after the first world war on a ranch somewhere in Montana. Aidan Quinn plays his eldest son, Alfred, and gives a stirring performance. All 3 sons (the other 2, played by Brad Pitt and Henry Thomas) have an affair with the same woman (played ably by Julia Ormond) at some point during the picture. Brad Pitt, as Tristan Ludlow, the 2nd in line, is wild at heart, but ably seems to underline the emotional familial texture of the film. His performance is pretty good, though his 20th century modern style is sometimes too apparent (IMO). The movie is a tad long and drawn out, and takes the viewer through a series of tragedies. Tears will fall from the watching of this one. The musical score bothered me some for it's melodramatic stylizing, but the cinematography was among the best ever put upon the screen in capturing the beauty and wonder of the Rocky mountain scenery. The storyline is very well developed, engendering pathos and energy throughout. Give kudos to director Edward Zwick for this movie. For it's length (almost 3 hours) he holds it all together quite capably.",7,0,0,14 February 2008
Tombstone," Too long
","Tombstone, a George Cosmatos directed picture from 1993: I am sorry, but I must give this kind effort a weak score. There is far too much laconic self importance among the principles, and very little typical human behavior. The fact that nobody ever uttered a humorous line in the entire picture says something about what Hollywood believes comprises entertainment these days. And this is a very long movie, full of melo-dramatic seriousness. (I suppose 'I'm your Huckleberry' expresses humor on some level, but. . .) Set in the late 1800s, Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp gives a very serious performance finding revenge laden motivations around every corner of the picture. Val Kilmer, as Doc Holiday, helps him some. . .at least offering a glimmer of lightness, but certainly not enough. He is somewhat lighter, but I would understand I suppose, given that his gun contains a vastly superior chamber for bullets than anyone had ever seen before. In one of the numerous gunfights, I have slowed the video down to count 35 consecutive bullets coming from his 2 guns a blazing. Credulity has little business in current Hollywood fare for ingestion, I suppose. Sam Elliot is just slow, serious, and weak here. His natural sounding accent for slow and stupid never gets more play than here. The rest of the cast seem to continually try to give the very image of themselves something definite to be remembered on screen, but is'nt this the directors entire idea here? Impression!?! I was not impressed, however.",4,3,7,3 March 2011
Sweet and Lowdown," For the love of Django
","Well, first off I just want to say that this is my all-time favorite Woody Allen movie. And that is saying something since he has made so many wonderful pictures over a few decades now. But this sweet movie, set in the prohibition age of the 30s, shows off Allen's unique ability to combine real comedy with a sort of expose into the ironic aesthetics of the human psyche and the human heart. Allen narrates throughout this picture, casting Sean Penn, who once again proves to be a really fine actor, and is perfectly placed in this semi-biographical piece where he gets to display his character's overblown egocentric eccentricities while also capturing the cheap emotional insecurities of the orphaned artist. As Emmett Ray, the world's 2nd greatest guitar player, he knows he cannot quite come to grips with his life's obsession, specifically; the gypsy guitarist Django Rheinhart, (and as everyone knows, the world's 'greatest guitar player'). This obsession fascinatingly becomes for Emmett one of ENVY throughout the film, which IS, in itself, an emotional metaphor that ultimately drives Emmett to outlandish behavior. His maniacal drive to assert himself and to prove to himself, somehow, that he is Rheinhard's equal. . . is a sweetly painful joy to watch. (He cannot get it resolved in his head, he cannot quite imagine that his cheap fly-by-night character is not just as 'artistic' as Django's MUST be!). His performance gets beautifully offset by Samantha Morton, who plays an innocent angelic mute-girl who, alone, can contain Emmett's ego long enough to bring him down to earth, and finally allow him to personalize a bit of his real artistic essence. Her ability to project a wonderful range of emotion while never uttering a sound is remarkable in the movie. Their chemistry is amazing throughout, and the sweetness of it becomes endearing. I cannot quite watch this picture, I think, without a big smile etched on my face, which to me makes it an enduring classic. Allen has done something here that he can never quite find throughout all the rest of his films, and that is to create, with masterful sweetness, a certain expose of the human psyche, and how funny and odd it may become to explore it a bit. The music was also quite wonderful, as usual with Woody Allen's classi films . And most of all I love the way this film leaves me feeling happier each and every time I watch it.",10,1,1,16 April 2008
