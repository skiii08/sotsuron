United 93," A moving and impressive tribute to the heroes on Flight 93
","Admittedly, the United 93 was hard to watch at times due to realism of the story. However, this tribute to those aboard the doomed Flight 93 was both moving and impressive. I am thankful to have seen a movie that portrays the heroes and evildoers as they truly were, instead of some politically correct film that tries to create sympathy for the terrorists and/or vilify the heroes. The flight passengers who fought back were truly the heroes, and the terrorists were truly the villains. In addition to being a moving tribute to the 9/11 heroes, I believe United 93 has the potential to go down in history as one of the most patriotic docudrama movies of all time.",9,2,4,30 August 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," My favorite movie of 1991
","I remember going to see T2 in the movie theater in the summer of 1991. I first saw it just a few days after its release and liked it so much that I went to see it again and again - and again! In other words, I saw it four times in a movie theater! As good as the original Terminator was (and still is), Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of those movie sequels that outdoes the original. It has great special effects, and Arnold Schawarzenegger is excellent as the Terminator. Robert Patrick did a fine job as the T-1000, a terminator programmed to seek and do away with John Connor (brilliantly played by Edward Furlong). Of course, Linda Hamilton reprised the role of John's mother, Sarah Connor. The film won some Oscar awards, including one for the visual effects, and deservedly so.T2 is my most favorite movie of 1991.",10,1,1,11 December 2011
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Hilarious and fun
","It was hard to watch this movie with a straight face. This was a strong indication that I found it to be a very funny movie. I enjoyed it from start to finish.What sets The 40-Year-Old Virgin apart from most other sex comedies is that the main character is both a virgin and, well...40 years old. When it comes to sex, Andy (cleverly played by Steve Carell) is a late bloomer. A very late bloomer. So his goal is to be rid of his virginity once and for all.I look forward to seeing this movie again, so that I get the same laughs I got when I first saw it. Perhaps, I will also get more laughs in the process.If you like sex comedies, see The 40-Year-Old Virgin.",Null,0,1,29 December 2005
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a wonderful Christmas movie!
","Every December, I watch a good number of Christmas movies, and this film is no exception. It's a Wonderful Life is a wonderful movie.It tells the story of a man named George Bailey (played by the late great Jimmy Stewart). After all that he goes through, including a financial problem, he becomes despondent to the point where he wishes that he had never been born. Clarence, who reveals himself to be George's guardian angel, sends George to a hypothetical world to show him what the town of Bedford Falls would be like if he had never existed. Needless to say, this hypothetical world is far worse than the real world. Fortunately, George comes to his senses, and retracts his grim wish.When he is brought back to the real world, he is a happy man again. He returns to his family, only to find a lot of townspeople contributing money to help get him out of a monetary crisis.It's a Wonderful Life is one of the most wonderful films of all time. Watch this Christmas classic every December.",Null,1,6,25 December 2008
Die Hard," One of the all-time best action movies
","Bruce Willis did a fantastic job as John McClane, a New York City police officer who takes on a gang of terrorists when they take over a Los Angeles high-rise. Alan Rickman was great as the menacing leader of the gang, and the inevitable final showdown between him and McClane is clever. Not only is Die Hard one of the best action movies of all-time, but it is also one of the most influential ones. The movie was so successful that it spawned four sequels and numerous copycats, such as Passenger 57 and Under Siege; the former is basically Die Hard on a plane and the latter is Die Hard on a ship. You cannot be a fan of action movies without seeing Die Hard. Plain and simple.",Null,1,1,23 November 2018
Halloween," An excellent, influential horror film
","Halloween is, without a doubt, a horror film that is both excellent and influential. It was so successful that it paved the way for more movies of its ilk. But most slasher films pale in comparison to Halloween.Michael Myers has been understandably mistaken for Jason Voorhees, the killer from the Friday the 13th films, especially since both characters wear a mask. But it should be noted that Halloween was released in the fall of 1978, nearly two years before the first Friday the 13th movie was filmed. Needless to say, there would have been no Jason if it hadn't been for Michael Myers.When it comes to watching horror movies in honor of the holiday Halloween, it would be both a mistake and an insult to exclude the film of the same name. If you like horror movies, watch Halloween. It's scary, and sometimes the scary moments happen when you least expect them to.",Null,0,0,20 October 2001
Goodfellas," The best film of 1990
","This excellent mob film is, in my opinion, the best movie of 1990.  It is well-written, and generally well-made.  If you like Mafia films, I recommend watching 'GoodFellas.' Ray Liotta's character, Henry Hill, may be the primary focus in the film, but Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro are the actual highlights.I'm aware that Joe Pesci won an Oscar for his performance in the film. His character, Tommy Devito, is one sick b****rd.  Yet, I like his sense of humor, especially when he asked, 'How am I funny?'  Whenever I watch that scene where he asks Henry Hill that question, it's hard for me to keep a straight face.  Pesci just cracks me up.Robert DeNiro does the role of Jimmy Conway well.  But if there's anything that the actor is generally good at, it is cursing, especially when he says the F-word.  It's just the way he swears that's interesting.  But is it unique?  The answer is: Little bit!",Null,0,0,26 February 2001
