Ali," Ali Not The Greatest!!!!!!
","Imagine watching a person run through the villiages of Africa for 20 minutes, looking at paintings of himself on the buildings, people chanting his name. Now, imagine watching that same scene in slow motion. That is exactly what we got in the movie Ali, a long, slow motion scene of Ali running through a villiage in Africa while looking at paintings on the wall.(Some Spoilers ahead-It is based on a true story)Ali had such promise, and delivered very little. The opening moments of the movie seem to last forever, probably because that song was 15 minutes long. Finally, after a long 15 minute intro, we get actual dialogue.
Ali does nothing to keep us into this film. What seemed to be an important part of his life, the whole draft dodge, the court cases, the battle, etc....once again, is put on the back burner, almost as it never really happened. One minute he can't fight, the next minute, we are greeted to a 2 minute scene with Joe Frazier. If you want to see the Joe Frazier portion of Ali's life, don't blink, because it is over that fast. What was one of the greatest feuds in all of sports, this movie shows us very, very little of this feud. Instead, we are shown a long drawn out scene of Ali Running, and then a slow motion boxing match with Foreman that ends the match. You want to know more of Ali's life after George Forman, read a book, because this film stops there.In this long three hour movie, we learn next to nothing about the 'greatest' boxer of all time. We learn about a friendship between Howard Cossel and Ali that was not to be(Entertainment Weekly suggests that they only had a business relaitionship.) We get very little of Joe Fraizer.
In the end, all we got was to pay $8.50 for a three hour nap.",1,8,16,8 January 2002
Spider-Man 3," Spider Man 3: Good film, but way too complicated for one movie.
","Spider-Man 3 (Contains Spoilers) *** out of ****As I write this, please keep in mind that I never read the comics...The Spider-Man films have always been focused on story while putting together great action. Both films have a nice flow and they were both really enjoyable. With that, I was looking forward to the 3rd installment but I must admit, I was a little worried, and with good reason.To me, this film was way to complicated for a 2 hour and 20 minute movie. I felt this film should have just had two villains instead of 3. Instead, with three villains, there was not enough focus on all three.The first two films built this great story between Peter Parker and Harry. This film continues that story but it seemed to rushed. I left the theatre wishing there was more from this story. Instead, their conflict was interrupted by two other villains. Sandman and Venom.Sandman was a pretty good villain but it seemed like he got the Two Face syndrome like in Batman Forever. He seemed to take a back seat to the rest of the story. It seemed as though he could have played a much larger role. And his departure was unsatisfying to me.Venom...possibly the most anticipated villain in the series and he seemed like he was just there. I felt they should have introduced him...possibly end the storyline where Peter rips off the black suit. Then have him face Sandman at the end. When all is said and done, show Brock in the church praying for the demise of Parker...and than the black suit falls onto Brock and the movie ends making the audience look forward to Spider Man 4, which has been green lighted...and with a piece of Symbiote still around, it's possible Venom will make a comeback in the 4th film...The College Professor still has a piece.This film did have some story to it. It's theme was about the choices we make in our lives.It Dealt with feelings of revenge and remorse. Forgiveness and redemption. Every character has a choice to make and it's the choices they make that will effect their path.Overall, this film had potential. It wasn't as good as the first two but it wasn't all that bad. The action scenes/fight scenes were incredible and everyone was great in their parts.One thing I can say is that all three films have reminded me of the first three Superman movies. With Superman 2, Superman chooses to be human for the woman he is in love with, losing his powers as three villains wreck havoc. Near end, he regains his powers and saves the day. In Superman 3, Superman is affected by a weird piece of Meterorite which turns Superman into a more evil version and eventually, Superman fights his inner-self. I know the Spiderman movies are more close to the comics than the Superman movies were, it just seems very close to me.__________________________________________________ Spider Man-**** Spider Man 2 **** Spider Man 3 ***",8,2,2,5 May 2007
Lost in Translation," Simply Amazing
","Lost In Translation is the best film of 2003. Sofia Coppola has definitly made a name for herself in this industry with her 3rd film. Bill Murray is excellent and Scarlett Johanson maybe today's best actress. It is a shame that the academy has shunned her performance and nominated Diane Keaton for a role in a movie that was very bad. As for the film itself, when watching you really get emotionally involved with the two characters and you want them to get together. Sofia does a great job at slowing the pace down of the movie so you feel just as tired and bored as the characters themselves. The writing is brilliant and the setting in Tokyo gives a great feel to this story. Definitly sit home an watch it, this is not just another chick flick.....4 Stars out of 4",10,0,1,27 January 2004
The Aviator," The Aviator Soars
",The Aviator is a great film that does two things. Gives Leonardo DeCaprio his best performance since What's Eating Gilbert Grape and becomes Martin Scorsese's best film since Goodfellas.DeCaprio puts on a fine performance as Howard Hughes and is well deserved of any awards he may get for this film. He molds himself into this role to the point where you forget that your watching Luke from Growing Pains on the big screen. He plays Hughes with a sentimental touch that we feel bad for any unfortunate events that happens to him. Hughes was an over achiever sometimes cocky in the way he had done things. But it was his cockiness that got him where he was. And his money. The film shows the mental problems that Hughes had to deal with including his OCD and his longing for someone to love and take care of him.Scorsese does a great job putting this film together. He tells a great story filled with emotion and suspense while adding some comedic tones that fit right in. The film is almost 3 hours but you never notice the time go by.I give this film **** out of ****,10,4,7,20 January 2005
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Arnolds Back!!!!!
","Terminator 3 is fantastic. The best film of the summer and proves that Arnold still looks good in an action film. I'm not going to sit here and give you the plot, you can read that in the other posts. What I will tell you is that some of the people who bashed this movie are wrong.I first heard someone say that Terminator 3 is nothing more than a prequel to the Matrix. I beg to differ. The whole Humans vs Machines in the future came about in the first Terminator, back in 1984. If anything, the Matrix is just a sequel to the Terminator series, going beyond 2029, or 2032.
As for the comedic tone, I saw the film 3 times all ready, and each time I have seen it, all the jokes seem to have gotten a great response. As for the Action, I think all in all, people were treated to something more than a few slow motion kung fu scenes. Terminator 3 refuses to go the way most action films have gone. Having a movie directed towards a well choregraphed fighting scene. Granted, Terminator 3 seems to be missing about 20 minutes of film, which is why the story does seem a little rushed, but at this point in the series, we don't need much character development. We know John Connor, we know the Terminators, all we really needed to know was Kate Brewster, and we get all that information in the middle of the film...As for why Arnold doesn't shoot one person while carrying the coffin, all though in the past(or future) Arnold killed John, is it impossible to believe that Kate Brewster while reprogramming the terminator, programmed him not to kill humans.....Just an IDEAAll in all **** out of ****- This film delivers for me.",10,1,2,13 July 2003
"I, Robot"," Something worth watching.
","I must admit, I didn't even want to go see this film but I did. of course, I went to the matinee so I wouldn't have to pay full price. After seeing the film, I was quite pleased. *****SPOILERS AHEAD******Will Smith plays a detective in the year 2036. It's Chicago, and the city is a mix of Humans and Robots. The Robots seem to have taken a lot of Human Jobs and Will Smiths character does not like this. Smith appears to have a dislike for the Robots but we find more about that later in the film.
will Smith is called by the very man who has just committed suicide. He is asked to investigate his death. Will Smith's investigation leads him to a Robot. This Robot is a newer model who seems to have more human characteristics. This Robot seems to have all the answers and Will Smith will soon find them all out but not till after he has gone through hell and back. There is a mix of basic movie formula and there are no real surprises but it does all work.This film reminds me of several films, the style in which it was filmed reminds me of Minority Report and the Story reminds me of Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes. I enjoyed the plot and am glad we didn't get stuck with another love story mixed in with the action.I did not like the fact that some of the movie was played like an extended commercial for Converse. It was a little too much advertising and was not needed. We got the point. I don't mind product placement but the director seems to really throw Converse in our face. As for the rest of the film, I give it 3 stars out of 4.",Null,0,0,16 July 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Watch it Twice if you only seen it once!!!!!
","*****SPOILERS**********
I originally saw this film in theatres when it was first released. I enjoyed the film but saw several holes in the theatre version. One hole is why would the filmmakers open doors and never return to them, such as the door the psychic opens when she tells Evan he has no soul and was never meant to be.
If you saw the theatrical version and was not satisfied, rent the Directors cut on DVD and the film will leave you pleased. The original ending planned(the one in the Directors Cut) makes the film so much better. It all makes sense at the end and except for minor flaws, most of the questions asked get answered at the end. 'The Butterfly Effect' is a good sci-fi film that deals with Time Travel in the right way. Showing the consequences of actions. Sometimes we are asked to believe that these actions only effect the lives of the involved but after watching the end of the directors cut, Evan's final Trip makes the largest difference. More lives are touched than ever before.
Ashton Kutcher gives us one of his finest performances, out doing his role in Dude,Where's My Car. I found myself getting wrapped up in the film and his performance that I forgot I dislike most of Kutcher's work. The supporting cast also puts on good performances. I really enjoyed Amy Smart in this film. All in all, I think if you sit back and watch the Directors Cut of 'The Butterfly Effect' you will enjoy the film for what it is, a good sci-fi classic. Best part about the Directors cut, it erases any thought of a sequel to ruin this film.",10,0,1,11 July 2004
Batman Begins," Batman Begins...and Delivers
","I saw Batman Begins last night and as I expected, this movie delivered. Christian Bale puts on a wonderful performance as the caped crusader/Bruce Wayne. While watching you really see a difference between the Bruce Wayne and Batman persona.Christopher Nolan has turned the Batman Franchise around after Joel Shumacher nearly destroyed the franchise. Dare I say it may be better than the original Tim Burton Batman. This film is dark the way a Batman movie should be. It delivers both a comic book feel with a sense of reality. The problem with Joel Schumacher and his direction is that the his Batman had too much of a cartoon feel that you couldn't connect with any of the characters. There were too many characters without any objectives. The characters in Batman Begins all have an objective which is what makes a screenplay a success.The film also explains how Batman became Batman. All the other previous films explained the origin's of the villains but we never really knew how Batman became Batman. We barely knew why he became Batman. This film's main focus is Batman. The original Batman focused on the Joker, Batman Returns was a story about the Penguin, Forever focused on the Riddler and the fourth Batman focused really on a relationship between Batman and Robin. This one is all about Batman and the man behind the mask. This film also illustrates how Batman gets his 'wonderful toys' and how he comes up with his name, his symbol.And don't worry, there are villains in this film and their motives may be a little cartoonish but like I said earlier, this film does give you a little of that comic book feel to it. I don't want to spoil any of the movie for you so I won't give you the plot but trust me, you will enjoy this film **** out of ****",10,0,0,15 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," Meet The Fockers...Again
","'Meet The Fockers' had it's funny moments, but because it is a sequel, it has to stand up to its predecessor. 'Meet The parents' was a funny film where the jokes all seemed to flow and you felt for Ben Stiller's character because he was trying his best not to screw up. In 'Meet The Fockers' we get some of the same jokes recycled. Some of the reality is taken out of the picture when Jack(Deniro) uses some of his C.I.A. tricks. We also wonder why Ben Stiller is still trying to impress Jack when at the end of the first film, he was holding his hand through the wedding.Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand were terrific as the Fockers. They were the exact opposite of Pam's parents yet they were believable parents not too out of the extraordinary. Both supplied very funny moments.The last film prospered from very funny supporting characters which this film seemed to lack. The baby jokes were mostly forced and there was not enough Jinxy Cat.This is not to say that 'Meet The Fockers' was a bad film. I found that there were some very funny moments. I also found that there were some very dull moments as well.Meet The Fockers= **1/2 out of **** Meet The Parents=***1/2 out of ****",7,0,2,3 January 2005
JFK," JFK is a great masterpiece.
","In 1991, Oliver Stone directed a movie that would center around one of the biggest events in American History, the assignation of President John F. Kennedy. With this film, Stone brought up the question of was there a conspiracy. Through out the film, he lends us ideas about a conspiracy and who may be behind the conspiracy, but he never gives us an answer. Why? Probably because Oliver Stone himself doesn't know the answer. In fact, I feel he is not making this film to tell us who is behind the assignation but instead to show that there was indeed a conspiracy behind the assignation and the American public is not in on any of the facts behind the assignation. JFK is about Jim Garrison, a New Orleans District attorney played by Kevin Costner in one of his most outstanding roles, and his quest to prove the Warren Commission wrong. The film begins with a brief history of John F Kennedy from his election victory up until his assignation on November 22, 1963. From then on, we the viewers watch as Jim Garrison begins to unravel the events of that day and watch him and his team searching for proof that Lee Harvey Oswald was not a lone gunman.      The film is over 3 hours long and in its run Oliver Stone introduces us to many characters and fills us with tons of information. And while we are accepting all this information we are able to follow along without missing a step of Garrison's trail. In the final climax of the film we see Garrison take local respected businessman, Clay Shaw played by Tommy Lee Jones, to trial. Shaw had been linked to several of the people behind the `conspiracy' through various witnesses. Shaw denied ever being part of the CIA however, in 1979, 10 years after the trial, the CIA admitted that Shaw was apart of the CIA. Of course, this came 5 years after Shaw's death. From these facts we can believe that Garrison was on the right trail and that the assignation was indeed, a conspiracy. JFK does bring up some valid points and all though some of the history may have been twisted for the film, it all works because it doesn't take away any of the questions the film asks. Was There a Conspiracy? The biggest piece of evidence that questions the Warren Commissions decision that Oswald was the only assassin was the home movie from Abraham Zapruder. This home movie clearly questions the lone gunman theory as we can clearly see that Kennedy was shot in the head from a front angle which would negate that Oswald was the only assassin being that Oswald was behind Kennedy in the schoolbook depository. Back and to the left, back and to the left, back and to the left Garrison repeats in the courtroom painting a picture that shows that if there was more than one gunman than there has to be a conspiracy. The film also states that in 1979, the U.S. Senate select committee found that the Kennedy assignation was probably a conspiracy however as of 1991, there has never been an investigation. Does JFK succeed in proving there may have been a conspiracy? Yes. Does JFK give us all the answers to the assignation? No. JFK does give us the idea that we may never get the real truth behind the assignation, just the truth the government wants us to have.",10,2,13,30 March 2004
2012," Check Your Brain and Enjoy
","There are some movies that you go to see because of the acting, or because of the story, or because it is an Oscar favorite. This is not one of them. This is a movie where you just need to check your brain at the door and be ready to be entertained.2012 is another one of those End Of The World Disaster films where the Government has a plan and our hero is a common person trying to get by and somehow we know, that both the government and the hero will meet up somewhere. I expected that going into the movie and that is basically what I got, however, I enjoyed it this time around. Sure, the story is predictable, and the characters just seem to get lucky every time around. Some may even say that this is an insult to ones intelligence. But what film is not predictable, and what film does not have convenient situations. I mean, doesn't every romantic comedy have that All is Doomed moment right before the couple reunite and fall in love for the final time. Doesn't every slasher film have that final confrontation with the Heroin and the killer. We as an audience know what to expect but we continue to see these movies. And I am OK with that. It's like going on a roller coaster. We know their are ups and downs, and their is always that final drop before everything smooths out.2012 is like that Roller Coaster ride. It has it's ups and downs, and we know that most people will make it to the end. We know that cities will fall, landmarks will crumble, and there will always be that All is Doomed moment where you think it's all over.John Cusack was actually pretty good in his first major action movie since Con Air. He's a likable character, much more then Dennis Quaid in 'The Day After Tomorrow' (Also directed by Roland Emmerich.) The destruction scenes were pretty entertaining as well. From the fall of L.A. to the site of an all ready fallen Las Vegas, I enjoyed the chaos around everyone.Now, this movie was not without it's flaws. Every film has an annoying kid who won't listen to his parents, and this one also had the annoying kid. Also, Danny Glover's President of the U.S. was uninspiring. Sometimes, the cgi did get in the way.With all of that, I still believe this is one of the better 'End of the World' disaster films and one worth the money to see in theaters. It is entertaining, it's fast, action packed, and in the end, I think you feel you got your money's worth. So what if there is no Oscar worthy performance. It is all right to see a movie that lets you take off your thinking caps so you can just enjoy without asking questions.",7,0,0,1 December 2009
The Number 23," The Number 23 is fine performance by Carrey
","The Number 23 *** out of **** Joel Schumacher is a director who may forever be known for the disgrace that was 'Batman and Robin' but Schumacher has done some pretty entertaining films, such as The Lost Boys, A Time To Kill, and Falling Down to name a few. 'The Number 23' is another film I would throw on that entertaining list though it is not without it's flaws.This film stars Jim Carrey who once again proves that he is more then just a slapstick comedy actor. In this film, Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, an Animal Control worker who is pretty content with his life but becomes obsessed with a book that his wife gave him after getting bit by a mysterious dog. He believes that the book is about him or at least mirrors his life. The main character in the book, a detective named Finerling (another character played by Carrey) becomes involved in a murder mystery that is somewhat disturbing and yet Sparrow seems to feel connected to everything that is going on. And as Fingerling in the book becomes more obsessed with the Number 23, so does Sparrow. The events in the book begin to mirror the events going on in Sparrow's life. Soon, Sparrow begins a journey to find out who the author of the book is.The scenes with Fingerling are stylish, somewhat of a comic book feel. The 'real' moments in the film have a nice dark and creepy feeling to it. The jumps from 'real' to 'Book' are done really well.The acting in this film is alway to perfection. Jim Carrey gives a stunning yet erie performance. He plays Walter Sparrow with a sense of warranted sympathy yet you can't help but be afraid of him as you join him on his obsession. Virginia Madsen is Agatha Sparrow, Walter's wife. She plays the part so well that you feel scared for her as she is watching her husband fall deeper and deeper into obsession.All in all, this film is stylish and fun to watch, filled with suspense however, I felt the ending fell a little flat. A flat ending can really derail a film and though this film suffers because of it, the acting, writing, and suspense keeps you into the film all the way to the end which makes it still worth watching.",8,0,0,6 May 2007
Back to the Future Part III," The Most Enjoyable Trilogy Comes to an End
","The Back To The Future Trilogy in my mind is the most enjoyable Trilogy out there. The Movies are not too long, the characters are easy to like, the bad guy is fun to hate and the plot line is easy to follow for anyone. The Adventures of Marty McFly and Doc Brown are exciting to watch in the first two films and the fun doesn't stop in the third.Often called the worst film of the bunch, BTTF three takes our characters to the old west. I, myself, enjoyed this idea. We did the 1955 thing twice, we been to the future, why not go back to a time where we could see Hill Vally being built. How the Tanned family has been picking on the McFly family as soon as the McFly's showed up in Hill Vally. I also liked the idea that the third film returns to a more simple storyline. The first film was almost a love story mixed with action, the second was action with interesting ideas in returning back to a time where there are two Marty's and two Doc Browns, two people who have all ready lived that day and can't risk running into their younger selves. The third film returns us back to a love story, this time involving Doc Brown and his interest, Clara Clayton.Now, some people have questioned the idea that If Marty had not gone back to 1885, than Doc wouldn't have been their to save Clara.'but i did have one small doubt. clara is saved by the doc. and marty together. meaning had marty not gone back in time, the doc. would not have saved clara as both of them went to the cliff. in which case clara would have been killed had marty not gone back. THEN HOW DID HER NAME APPEAR ON THE GRAVESTONE OF THE DOC. BEFORE MARTY WENT BACK IN TIME?SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD LONG BEFORE THE DOC GOT KILLED'Interesting point, but one must remember that if Marty would not have come back to 1885, than Doc would have picked Miss Clara Clayton at the train station. See, in the original folk tale, before Doc traveled to 1885, no one picked Clara at the station, and she fell into the Ravine, however, when Doc goes back in time, Doc is there to pick Clara up at the station. When Marty goes back to 1885, Doc is asked to pick her up, but he forgets because he is with Marty, but later, Doc happens to save her anyway, thus falling in love with her.BTTF Trilogy manages to amaze me in each film, and the climatic train sequence is a wonderful ending to the Time Machine and the Trilogy. I only hope that maybe one day, they can bring back BTTF to the big screen one more time.",10,1,1,3 January 2003
Saw II," Saw II Delivers the goods
","It's been awhile since I have given out a review.Saw II is a film that follows in the tradition of the original. It is sick, it is bloody, and it is smart. Smart in that the film pays attention to it's own details. Unlike the first Saw, we know who the bad man is. A surprise like that is hard to duplicate but what this film does is go into more detail into why Jigsaw does what he does.Like the first film, there is nothing predictable about Saw II. Just when you think you may know the answer your find out your dead wrong. There are twist and turns in this film and unlike some of the other horror films these days, these twists make sense. And the film also manages to answer some questions from the original film.The acting is a bit better in this film, but thats probably cause it took them 7 more days to film Saw II than it did the first Saw. The first Saw had the director filming rehearsals and using those shots in the actual movie. This film has a slightly bigger budget which definitely helps. This film is not weakened by a script that took less than a year to write and get on screen.The ending is a different kind of surprise yet it still works for me. All in all, what makes this and the first Saw great horror films is that it plays upon the viewers fears. The film knows and respects the genre and it respects it's audience. At not one moment does Saw II shortchange their viewers. That in it self makes this a successful horror film. Throw in a good plot with good dialogue, good acting and a hell of a lot of blood, scares and tension, and you have made yourself a film that will be talked about for years. And now they have done it twice.",9,1,2,30 October 2005
World Trade Center," A tale of good, and not about evil
","World Trade Center-**** out of ****Some believe it is too early for a film about the events that occurred on September 11, 2001, saying that Hollywood is trying to profit from the tragedy of that day. I heard it before when United 93 appeared in theatres back in early spring. United 93 was released, and was a mild success, the latest talk was about World Trade Center, a film directed by Oliver Stone, a director who is known for his interest in political history. Many feared that Stone may try to use this story as a way to show people what he saw on the day of September 11, 2001. Instead, Stone shows us the good in humanity through the eyes of two new York Port Authority Policeman who became trapped in the rubble and pulled out to safety.It is an emotional story, but a story that should be told, because we always hear about the evil that happened on that day, but so few times do we hear all the good that happened, and this is one of those stories.Nicholas Cage plays John McLoughlin, who like many people who work in New York City, wake up at 3 in the morning for a long commute, either from Long Island, New Jersey, or upstate New York. Slowly, we meet his family though they are all asleep, we can see that he has a wife and 4 children. Next, we meet Will Jimeno, played by Michael Pena (Crash.) Jimeno is a rookie for the Port Authority. As the two begin their day, so do the events of 9/11. Soon, they and many other go off to the World Trade Center to help with the evacuations, and as they and a few others are inside, the towers come down.The rest of the film we see these two struggle to stay alive as their families struggle to keep hope that they are alive. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives an extraordinary performance as Allison jimeno, Williams wife.We are introduced to people who will play a key role in their rescue. Michael Shannon plays David Karnes (Staff Sgt. Karnes of the U.S. Marines) a man who after the news, leaves his job, suits up in his uniform and makes his way down to Ground Zero.This film works for the opposite reasons why United 93 worked. With United 93, there were a lot of unknown actors who looked more like regular people. It helped the audience to relate to the victims on that flight a bit easier because we were able to see these people as anyone or better yet, someone like us. A grandma, a businessman, a wife, a child, a husband, a cousin, a teacher, etc-these descriptions are everyone one of us. In World Trade Center, the better actors were better trained not to overact and over dramatize the events. Instead, they are natural with their delivery and with that, put on a better performance.As mentioned earlier, this is not a film about politics. In fact, there is no real mention of terrorism except for the news on the television sets. In fact, we never even actually see the planes crash into the World Trade Center. I like this aspect because many of us did not even see these planes crash until after they hit when the media got a hold of personal camcorders. Also, many of the rescuers who risked their lives did not even see the planes hit.This film is about the good in humanity. For all the evil that occurred, there was a lot more good that went on. And what makes it better is that everything that happens in the film is all based on the accounts of the McLoughlin family and the Jimeno family and the others who participated in the rescue of the two gentleman. There were 20 people who were rescued from the rubble of the Trade Center, Jimeno was 18, and McLoughlin was 19. It makes it a much better watch to know that this story is not made up like the story in Pearl Harbor or the love story of Titanic. These are real people and they were rescued, and many helped in their rescue. And how do we know? Because many of us watched on one of the various news channels that brought us these rescues. Some may say that I am biased towards this film because I lived in New York at the time so I have to like it, but I lived on Long Island, miles away from Ground Zero. I watched as most Americans did, through the eyes of the men holding the news cameras.This is a film that all should watch at least once. Not because you should feel like you have to because it is your patriotic duty, but because it is a real true feel good story with a happy ending that isn't made up. It does well in showing that no matter how evil some can be, there are a lot more good people out there, and most of them are just like you and me.",10,2,6,10 October 2006
Blood Diamond," A great Film
","Blood Diamond ***1/2 out of **** The people of the United States are known to be huge consumers. What these consumers don't know is the history of what they are buying. For instance, that shirt made in Korea, or your game system made in Japan, or how about that diamond ring found in Africa.Blood Diamond is the story of a smuggler, an African native and a journalist in the country of Sierra Leone at a time of Civil War. By the first ten minutes of this film, we know how violent it's going to get when a Rebel Group of fighters, the RUF, come into a village and terrorize it's peaceful citizen. What do these guys want. Strong abled bodies to do their Diamond Mining. What about the rest of the people. Kill them.Djimon Hounsou is Solomon Vandy, one of the villagers that the rebels have taken hostage. He is forced to mine for Diamonds. While on the job, he stumbles upon a huge 100 karat Diamond. He buries the diamond as the area is being secured by armed forces against the RUF.Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a diamond smuggler who finds Solomon while in a jail house. He hears that Solomon has found a priceless Diamond and comes up with a plan to use Solomon to get that diamond. He offers to help find Solomon's family.Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) is a journalist looking for a story to expose the Diamond Scheme to the First World Nations. She wants Archers story.The film is a violent adventure that exposes the real life violence in Africa because of US consumer needs. Leonardo DiCarprio (Nominated for Oscar)gives an awesome performance despite his accent. Jennifer Connelly gives a convincing performance as Maddy Brown, she is everything; Sexy, Sensitive, Brave and Smart all at once. The best performance of the movie goes to Djimon Hounsou(Nominated for Best Supporting Actor,) the refugee searching for his family. Above all, we want to see his character come out on top.The villains in this film are deep and we really hate them because they are, plain and simple, bad dudes you don't want to mess with. They will stop at nothing, including having children kill innocent people.Once again, the film is violent, but this kind of film has to be violent to get it's point across. The reality of this country is violent, it is gruesome and yet the western world closes their eyes and soaks up the benefits.",9,0,1,6 May 2007
The Departed," Scorsese is Back!!!!!!!
","The Departed **** out of ****Over the past 5 years, it seemed as though Martin Scorsese was spending too much time trying to win himself an Oscar for best director that the films he was making, though good, were not typical Scorsese films. Gangs of New York and the Aviator were both good films though it seemed as though I wasn't watching a Scorsese film. After viewing The Departed, all I can say is that Scorsese is back.This film almost seems to be a screw you to the Academy. He did his best to conform to Academy style to win his award and when all was done, Scorsese was left standing statue less. Now, Scorsese returns to a genre that has made him one of the best directors in the business. The Departed is a crime drama that is bloody and vulgar just the way Scorsese has made films in the past.The Departed has an all-star cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg.Nicholson plays Frank Costello, a villainous crime boss who under the eye of the Boston Police and FBI. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Billy Costigan, a police cadet hired to go secretly undercover to be an informant Sheen and Wahlberg. It is later learned that not only does the authorities have an informant in Costello's crew, but Costello has an informant in the State Police.All the cast members give an outstanding performance. It is hard to say who had the best performance because they were all great. Nicholson, who has been doing a lot of comedies lately, reminds us just how great of a villain he can be. DiCaprio reminds us once again that he is a better actor then Titanic would suggest.Damon once again shows us why he is one of the better actors today. And though both Wahlberg and Baldwin both have small parts, they come across as great performances.The film runs in at about 2 1/2 hours but it certainly doesn't feel like it. There are no slow moments which is good for a long film. Scorsese has a brilliant talent for mixing a great soundtrack with a great film. Look at Goodfellas and Casino. Both of their soundtracks help push the films along. The violence is in your face as it should be with a story like this.In doing this film, Scorsese may bring himself a best director award at the Oscars without trying as hard as he did in the past. Many feel he was robbed back in 1990 for Goodfellas and it would only be fitting that he gets an award for this film being this film is his most violent since Goodfellas. Lets just hope that Kevin Costner isn't working on Dances With Wolves II.",10,3,6,10 October 2006
The Good Shepherd," The Sometimes Good Sheperd
","** out of **** The Good Sheperd starts off slow and continues the pace all the way through the film. If you make it to the end, you almost want to congratulate yourself for being able to stay awake for almost 3 hours.When I found out DeNiro was going to be directing this film, I was excited as I am a huge DeNiro fan. The film is Robert DeNiro's second in which he directed. The first being the cult classic 'A Bronx Tale.' 'A Bronx Tale' was solid because DeNiro was the set director. ' The Good Shepard' DeNiro took over the directing job during pre-production. The film was mess before it got started.The film is about how the CIA came about. It's an interesting story that loses interest fast. Matt Damon is Edward Bell Wilson, a man who never intended to be involved in any type of government agency but had his destiny fall in the palms of his hands despite his dreams. And though he is perfect for the job and a true American, his personal life suffers because of it. Matt Damon is great in his performance and is reason number one why we continue to watch this film.The second reason is Angelina Jolie as Edwards wife. Sexy and beautiful, she plays this part with real emotion and the audience suffers with her, not because of her. This may be one of her finest performances as she is real convincing.The rest of the film is slow and sometimes hard to follow. The story is told in the present and the past and finally, they meet up with each other for an ending that is probably supposed to be surprising but isn't because either you see it coming, or you just don't care about any of the characters that it involves.All in all, it's an OK film with fine performances and some interesting scenes. It is a film that I would have waited for the DVD or even cable because at least if I fall asleep, I fall asleep at home instead of a theater chair.",6,1,2,6 May 2007
