Moneyball," One of Best Films of Year - Not a baseball movie.
","Moneyball is one of the best films of 2011 - and it is not a baseball movie. Moneyball moves briskly through the story, moving through scenes of humor, frustration, excitement - carrying viewers on the emotional roller coaster of Brad Pitt's character.Baseball is a backdrop not a dominating presence in the film. The interactions between Brad Pitt and the scouts, managers, and players provide some very humorous moments and a few touching scenes. But, they are just a part of the story.Brad Pitt dominates the film with an outstanding performance of a driven man seeking to prove he is the best in the business of baseball. Brad Pitt does a great job capturing the internal conflict, anger, frustration, and ego of a man born to be a baseball star - but who fell short. Brad Pitt deserves Oscar consideration for this performance.The heart of the film is the relationship between the characters played by Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Both do a wonderful job in the roles, and they have some great interactions. Jonah did a great job in an understated way. Some of his best moments are quiet reactions to the antics of Brad Pitt's character.I'm not a baseball fan, but I loved the movie and would highly recommend it.",9,1,3,6 October 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Game of Shadows is a laugh and thrill-packed adventure
","Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows follows the pattern of the first movie with Sherlock & Dr. Watson facing off against an evil villain. In this second going around, the great chemistry and interaction of Sherlock & Dr. Watson take the movie to a whole new level of fun and laughs.I enjoyed the director's style in the movie, though many people will not. The director uses many unique views and lots of slow motion and stop action to highlight the realism of the film. In addition, the director's goes both back in time to highlight how Sherlock unravels specific mysteries and forward in time to visually walkthrough Sherlock's anlaysis of a situation. The style is unique and dynamic.While Robert Downey Jr. has the central role as Sherlock, Jude Law steals the movie with his portrayal of Dr. Watson. Throughout the movie, the pair have great interactions, and their back-and-forth dialogue generates lots of funny moments. Robert Downey Jr. carries off the eccentricities of Sherlock with great enthusiasm, but Dr. Watson's expanded role adds to the depth of their relationship.A pleasant surprise in the film was the introduction of Sherlock Holmes' brother, who added some charm and comedy to the film in his small role. On the other hand, I was somewhat disappointed in Sherlock's nemesis Dr. Moriarty. The actor did a competent job, but the role didn't live up to the hype of Sherlock's ultimate foe.Overall, Game of Shadows was enjoyable with an interesting story line, lots of action, and plenty of laughs. However, many will be put off my the director's unique, in-your-face style, which I enjoyed.",8,17,35,16 December 2011
Hugo," Hugo is an Enchanting Film
","Hugo is an enchanting film that will dazzle the viewer with its beautiful scenes, real characters, and simple emotional story. This wonderful film reminds me of one of my favorite Italian films 'Cinema Paradiso', as they both stir up strong emotions in a simple and beautiful way.Hugo is an orphan who lives at a train station and cares for the station's clocks. Hugo is devoted to fixing a mechanical robot (an automaton), hoping for a message from his deceased father. Hugo steals from a toy shop owner, constantly dodges the train station policeman, and befriends a young girl. These characters become an important part of Hugo's life, as he works to uncover the mystery of the automaton.I haven't been a big fan of 3-D technology, which has been disappointing in most films that I've seen in 3D. However, Hugo's 3-D effects are stunning and really make you feel part of the scenes. The director Martin Scorcese does a magical job with this 3-D medium in creating a visual masterpiece.While billed as a children's movie, this film will be more appreciated by adults and older children. The story moves slowly, but, since the movie pulls you into Paris of many years ago, you don't even notice. Overall, Hugo is a wonderful and unique film that we'll be a rewarding movie experience.",9,5,9,27 November 2011
Warrior," Warrior is One of Best Movies of 2011
","Outstanding film! I'm not a MMA fan, but I loved the movie. The fighting was well done and complemented the story of the brothers and their family. The film was highlighted by great acting and a great story/drama. The actors were amazing from the lead actors (Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton) to the supporting actors (Nick Nolte, Jennifer Morrison). Tom Hardy was excellent as the favored prodigal son returning home, and Joel Edgerton did a phenomenal job as the underdog son fighting for his family. The film had a wonderful pace and kept me riveted throughout the movie. Warrior should receive multiple awards from acting to directing to best picture!",10,5,14,9 September 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Ghost Protocol delivers with intense action, cool settings
","The Mission Impossible franchise has had some hits and some misses, but Ghost Protocol may be the best of the Mission Impossible movies. Tom Cruise is intense and focused as the spy Ethan Hunt, who is working to stop a nuclear terrorist. Tom Cruise has some great action scenes, and he is at his best in the chaos of chasing down bad guys.Ghost Protocal introduces some new characters played by Paula Patton & Jeremy Renner. Paula does a great job as a fellow agent who seeks out revenge in working with Cruise. Jeremy Renner, who I loved in previous movies, starts out slow and forced as an 'analyst' before getting into the flow as a spy with skills rivaling Tom Cruise.Simon Pegg adds the comic relief as the team's IT genius. He has an understated manner that draws quite a few laughs. The spy team has good chemistry that strengthens the movie, and they all come off as believable spies. And, the main characters each have side stories that revolve around the main story, adding some depth to the movie.While the storyline follows the standard good spies track down evil maniac, the highlight of the movie was some incredible settings. A Russian prison was a great opening to the movie, and Dubai and Mumbai provided unique and fascinating backdrops to the action. The skyscraper and sandstorm scenes were both thrilling and fun.Overall, Ghost Protocol is worth a full price ticket. Tom Cruise is at his best as Ethan Hunt, the supporting cast is very good, the action is great, and the settings are amazing.This review will self-destruct in five seconds...",8,2,5,23 December 2011
Drive," Drive moves slowly with lots of violence
","Trailers made Drive out to be a car heist, action-type movie (probably to attract a wider audience), but the trailers were misleading.Drive is a slow-moving, violent drama. Ryan Gosling's character spends much of the movie listening or thinking, often while driving, which tends to really stall the movie (especially with the recurring slow-motion camera work). But, Ryan does a good job with an introverted character who tries to help out his neighbor. He makes you want to root for him.Ryan's awkward love interest is played by Carey Mulligan. She didn't do much with a rather lifeless character.After an hour to setup the conflict, the movie quickly devolves into a series of very violent encounters which are at odds with the first half of the movie. The stark contrast heightens the violent feel of the film.Overall, I enjoyed the movie, though it was not what I expected. Ryan Golsing was the highlight of the movie with some great visual camera work and a good soundtrack.",7,0,1,6 October 2011
Puss in Boots," Fun Movie for Kids and Adults
","Puss in Boots was what I expected - interesting characters, some great laughs (including the Shrek-like humor for adults only), and an interesting backstory. Unfortunately, no cameos from major Shrek characters (I always get a kick out of Gingy).Antonio Banderas does a great job voicing the 'hero' Puss, and the movie provides Puss' history with some good laughs and great images. The big eyes look of the adult Puss is topped by the young Puss, and we learn how Puss received his name and his boots.Humpty Dumpty is Puss' long-time friend, who becomes jealous of the young hero Puss and betrays him. But, Humpty Dumpty returns with a plan to achieve their lifelong goal - get the goose that lays the golden eggs. Humpty Dumpty has some funny lines and great visual humor. My favorite was Humpty wearing a golden egg costume.Joining the adventure and rounding out the trio is Kitty Soft Paws, who transitions from Puss' nemesis to love interest. The pair has some great chemistry for animated characters. Their adventures include run-ins with Jack & Jill (not what anyone will expect), magic beans, the beanstalk, and the goose that lays the golden egg.Overall, kids and adults will love the movie for its humor, cute characters, and action. Puss in Boots is a worthy spin-off of Shrek. And, the movie has a great message about learning from our mistakes, retribution, and making good choices.",9,70,86,29 October 2011
In Time," Entertaining Movie - Well Worth Your Time
","In Time was an interesting and entertaining movie set in the distant future where humans were genetically altered to stop aging at 25, at which point they receive one year of time. Then, they must earn more time to live, and, when they run out, they die.The movie did a great job of highlighting the different classes. The poor lived day-by-day and hour-by-hour. They watched their time closely and always lived near death. The rich, however, had unlimited time and resources, but they lived in fear of someone killing them for time. The movie had great social commentary - using time instead of money.Justin Timberlake did a great job as the main character who is given a century of time then becomes a future day Robin Hood, stealing time from the rich and giving to the poor. I loved Timberlake in Social Network, and he shines here as well, dominating the film with a captivating performance.Amanda Seyfried did a good job as Justin's love interest, who lived a trapped, sheltered life in a wealthy family. After being held captive by Justin, she falls for him and they face their future fighting the system together.In another excellent performance, Cillian Murphy shines as the Timekeeper trying to stop Justin's character. Although I still picture him as the creepy Sandman from Batman, he does a great job as a timekeeper living day-by-day but committed to protecting the system.Overall, the movie was entertaining, had engaging actors, and made you think about what it would be like to constantly figure out how you would survive day-by-day collecting time to survive.",8,2,9,29 October 2011
50_50," Humorous and Touching Story of Dealing with Cancer
","Cancer casts a wide net of emotional devastation. 50/50 does an excellent job of capturing the many facets of people dealing with this disease. The story, directing, and acting make you feel with part of the downward emotional and physical spiral of Joseph Gordon-Leavitt's character as he deals with the 50% probability of surviving his cancer.I'm a big fan of Joseph Gordon-Leavitt's films, and his acting here is exceptional. He captures the whole spectrum of emotions as his character looks in the face of death. Despite the difficult circumstances and the anger, frustration, and hopelessness that comes with it, his character continually seeks out hope and rays of light.50/50 does a wonderful job at providing insights into both decaying relationships (main character's girlfriend), evolving relationships (main character's mother - excellent acting by Angelica Houston in a supporting role), and new relationships (main character's therapist and fellow cancer patients).50/50 has many touching moments, as the main character uncovers the strengths of his relationships, as his family and friends deal with their own emotional challenges while trying to help the main character. Seth Rogan does a good job as his aimless, foul-mouthed best friend, and he provides many humorous moments with his loud and direct manner.Overall, 50/50 does an excellent job with a difficult subject. 50/50 excels where Funny People, about Adam Sandler's character facing cancer, failed a couple years ago.",10,1,2,6 October 2011
