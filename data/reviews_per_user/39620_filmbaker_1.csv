The Avengers," Avengers = bad reviews = what?
","Many people give the Avengers bad reviews because it has too many superheroes. But here's what they need to realize = you don't walk into a theater to watch 'The Avengers', a movie that's SUPPOSED to have multiple superheroes, without realizing it's supposed to anyway.This movie had a lot of action, good humor, and great acting. What are people thinking giving this movie bad reviews just because one thing was hokey = how Loki got out of that place he was stuck in. Maybe if they saw the post-credits scene to Thor, they wouldn't mind as much.Whatever is running through the heads of the people who rant on this one, I can think of something that will turn their argument around. If not turn it around, at least make the argument a tie. Avengers was a great movie. Bottom line.",Null,1,7,2 March 2013
