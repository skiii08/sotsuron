Gremlins," Not 'Christmassy' Christmas Classic!
","I really love this movie. I know that some of the effects can seem to be a bit outdated and some of it might seem a little hammy now that we're older but I still find it to be a lot of fun.Gremlins is a bit of a Christmas classic and holiday tradition at our house, where we watch it every year and always have a good time. It's got decent scares in it but not too scary for most kids, and the actors seem to have a lot of fun.Also even though they are dated the practical effects are still pretty good and I tend to like them more than CGI effects but that is obviously a personal preference type thing.And Gizmo is so cute!!!",Null,1,2,26 July 2017
The Monuments Men," A Bit Disappointing
","I thought this movie was a bit of a disappointment. I am a fan of the films George Clooney has worked on in the past (even though I am not exactly a huge George Clooney the actor fan, but not anti-Clooney either, I could take him or leave him). I do like a lot of the actors in this. As far as I am concerned I don't think Bill Murray could make a wrong move in any movie because he always comes across great just doing his thing, and he does the usual good job here.The movie is about a group of guys who kind of get thrown together when they form a unit to save valuable art from the Nazis. They don't want it to get destroyed or stolen so risk their lives to get it all back before the end of the war comes.",Null,1,1,23 February 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Vomit Inducing Garbage
","The Phantom Menace is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. To people saying it was a good movie because it made money, you don't understand that people lined up with money in hand to see this because the first three movies were so good. Hopes were high but this just stunk. The main problems were that George Lucas writes the worst dialogue ever. And the acting was terrible. The little boy was awful and Jar Jar was maybe the most annoying character ever, and clearly several of the characters, like Jar Jar, were based on racial stereotypes. Pathetic. Jar Jar was like a black guy from the 1800s. And the guy who owned the scrap yard was Italian, and the evil scheming aliens in the trade confederation were Asians. George Lucas must have some problems with other cultures. Second, the first movies were good when they used real puppets, it just looked more real, I don't know why Lucas has to rely so much on CGI when, as good as it can get, it still doesn't look REAL. Yoda looked stupid in these movies compared to the original, puppet Yoda. And the plot was dumb. The only good performance was Qui Gon Jin. This was stupid!",Null,0,1,18 February 2008
Independence Day," Awful
","This is one of the worst 'blockbusters' I've ever had the misfortune to see. The movie was so awful, I kept thinking 'we should just walk out' but convinced myself it would get better but it never did. I almost have it bonus points because I laughed out loud a few times but I don't think they should get a higher score just because the movie was so bad it was unintentionally funny.Will Smith wasn't too bad but the plot was terrible. They send up a drunken crop duster who was once kidnapped by aliens to fight them in a jet plane? Really? An alcoholic? The PRESIDENT goes up in a jet fighter to fight the aliens, and beats them? Yes, because that would ever happen. My favorite part was where every other country in the world was just sitting around waiting to die until the Americans finally figure out how and then send them all Morse code signals. Otherwise they'd just have no idea what to do other than sit in their tents and wait to be killed or starve.But the effects were good.",Null,8,14,21 February 2008
Days of Thunder," Days of Thunder
","BIG SPOILERS WARNING! Continue reading at your own risk.This movie is pretty stupid. Tom Cruise is a race car driver and Nicole Kidman is his friend's doctor after his friend has a car accident in the movie. The accident almost kills his friend, and knocks him out of racing, and even though his friend lives and gets better Tom Cruise loses his edge and his nerve and can't compete any more. He deliberately starts sabotaging his own car just so he can get out of races. Robert Duvall is his driving team's captain, who runs the pits, and while Tom Cruise's performance is just mediocre Duvall is actually annoying. Why does he always play the same character? He's a gruff, tough, southern-type guy who's seen it all and knows it all. Anyway in the big race at the end Cruise of course ends up winning for the big happy ending. And of course he ends up with Nicole Kidman. Yawn. I'd recommend only to huge NASCAR fans because some of the racing scenes are pretty exciting which is the only reason I give this a higher rating than just a one.",Null,0,2,18 February 2008
The Princess Bride," Great Movie
",Is there anybody that doesn't like The Princess Bride because everyone I have ever talked to about this movie loved it.I have seen it probably fifty times and it still is a great movie to me.If you like fantasy films you will love Princess Bride and the best parts are the character parts because all the performers are so good in it. I love Andre The Giant in his part because I am also a wrestling fan and he was very funny in it. So was the little nerdy guy he worked for that is my favorite scene where he faces off with the hero in disguise.If you haven't seen this yet then see it.,Null,0,1,5 May 2007
The Happening," The Crap-pening!
","I hope you are entertained by the title of my summary because it is far more clever than anything you will see in this movie. The acting is terrible. The direction is terrible. The script is terrible. The dialog is so terrible many of us in the theater laughed out loud and yet the movie wasn't quite bad/good enough for the 'so-bad-it's-at-least-funny' pile, which Lady in the Water was bad/good enough for. This movie is a complete disappointment on every level. The trailer looked decent so I thought I'd give M Night another chance but this movie sucks and I now have officially given up on him. I don't even like Sixth Sense any more now that I've seen it three times and realize it was overrated even by myself somehow! One last note, why on earth does M Night Shyamalan keep putting himself in his own movies? He really truly can't act at all. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bad. Why is he ruining his own movies? If he's not good enough to get parts in other people's movies he should give up his acting dream.",Null,3,9,14 June 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Godfather III
","This is an okay movie as part of the trilogy because it wraps up the three-part story. But on its own it is not that great of a film. The performances aren't nearly as good as in the first two films, and especially the first one. The new characters are who I am mostly referring to here.On its own this movie also drags a little bit sometimes. Unlike the first two movies which are probably just as long, part three gets a little bit boring in places. There are some good scenes and Al Pacino is still a pretty good actor but over all it just doesn't compare to parts one and two.And the ending is a little bit predictable which takes some of the emotion out of that scene.",Null,1,2,20 February 2008
Scream," Good horror movie.
",This is a really good horror movie. It plays with all the conventions of slasher horror movies that came before it and it is still also scary. It honestly was not predictable as I find most horror movies to be. Even when you do figure out what's going on you can't figure out why until it is explained at the climax of the film. The sequels aren't nearly as good as this movie is but it is a very good film especially for people who like moments of dark comedy and big fans of horror movies who know a lot about horror movies because they will appreciate the way this film is playing with the conventions of the horror/slasher genre. Some very scary moments too and a great beginning sequence sets the film up well.,Null,0,0,17 February 2008
Hart's War," Hart's Bore
","Do you like my summary title? You should because it is incredibly, fantastically clever. Well, at least it is more clever than the writing that went into this movie.Hart's War is just another average war-slash-buddy movie. If there is one thing that keeps Hart's War from being a complete waste of time it is Bruce Willis who gives a typically good Bruce Willis performance. Colin Farrell is not very good in this movie but I've never been that thrilled with him anyway. In his part in this film he seems like he's pretty much just 'along for the ride' with Bruce.The story isn't too bad but it's a pretty predictable story and the climax doesn't seem like it's worth watching the whole movie to get to it.",Null,1,3,24 February 2008
Semi-Pro," Disappointing and Mostly Unfunny
","Will Ferrell stars as Jackie Moon in basketball movie Semi-Pro. Jackie Moon is the owner, coach, and star player of an ABA (American Basketball Association) team, the Flint (Michigan) Tropics.The ABA is about to go bankrupt so they decide to merge with the National Basketball Association, but there is only room for the top four teams to move to the NBA, and all of the other teams will fold. The Tropics are the worst team in the ABA so Jackie decides (so that he will still have a team) to rally his team to start winning some games. But Jackie is not a good leader and not even close to a 'star player', in fact he only plays because he owns the team, which he bought with the money he earned from recording a fluke hit song. He decides to bring in a washed-up NBA player (Woody Harrelson) to hopefully help his team make it into the playoffs and finish fourth.It sounds like a good premise and I'm a big Will Ferrell movie fan so I was expecting a lot but this movie didn't deliver. There are a couple of good jokes and typical Will Ferrell physical comedy but overall it was flat and disappointing. If you're a big Ferrell fan it's still worth seeing but I wouldn't recommend paying for it.",Null,7,16,1 March 2008
