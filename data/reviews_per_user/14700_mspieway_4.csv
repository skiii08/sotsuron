United 93," Should be required viewing for schools
","Just saw this movie, was very apprehensive, but oddly enough I did not leave the theater crying, rather I felt very angry! This should be required viewing for all Americans!! Especially the high school & college crowd, as it is their generation who will take on the battle (or perhaps chose not to) against these religious extremists who desire to annihilate us. As for those who say it is 'too soon', well, it is almost FIVE years after the fact. Was the Pearl Harbor attack so quickly forgotten? I found the movie to be very well acted, nothing was done for the sake of 'selling tickets'. No political bias, no gratuitous violence, no over-reaching sentimentality in portraying those last phone calls to loved ones. Thankfully the producers did not choose any big name stars, which could have taken focus away from the subject matter. I applaud the decision (much contested) to reveal just how horrible that day was... but it also revealed how proud we can be of fellow Americans who decided to TRY to help themselves & others.",10,0,2,19 May 2006
Inglourious Basterds," so so
","Overrated. Tarantino seems to make movies just to prove he can; there is NO depth or soul. At times, we heard chuckling in the audience. Somehow I did not expect to find comedy in a movie about Nazi Germany. Add in the over-long drawn out scenes showing a strudel dessert, or a hat w/veil being put on...painfully 'artistic'. The storyline of getting even with vicious killers by viciously killing them seems contradictory in a sense. Somehow it makes a mockery of what the holocaust victims endured. I think this movie is only being applauded because it was made by Tarantino. IF anyone else had directed it, it wouldn't even be on the radar. Maybe the only ones impressed by this film needed to be Tarantino diehards. If that is true, there is no need for criticism as ANYTHING would satisfy. Sorry fans, it just didn't live up to expectations.",4,21,38,18 October 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," could not watch till end
","Just plain ridiculous. I gave up 1/3 way thru and started reading a book, spouse kept on...nothing made any sense to me. Bridges - a joke. Clooney - a joke. How did they manage to snare these 2 somewhat decent actors? Did they think they were involved in another masterpiece (ex: Dr Strangelove)? Sorry to burst the bubble, but if so they were mistaken. I watched the last 5 minutes where they laughed about spiking food with LSD...yeah, funny... The premise of some goofball journalist getting into a war zone...yeah, right. The only good thing about renting this movie, was the fact that we got it from RedBox for a buck...therefore not much was wasted...except our time & the electricity needed to run it. Save yourself. Read an old MAD Magazine instead.",1,19,37,6 April 2010
Munich," not what i expected...
","How to review a movie without taking sides on its storyline? I expected more from this movie. The lead actor was unable to portray any REAL emotion, the sex scenes (in beginning with very pregnant wife + at the end, pounding to the flashbacks of the 1972 massacre) were tasteless & unnecessary, much was left unclear, the whole story seemed unbelievable: after the Israeli Olympic team was killed, the Israeli prime minister & cabinet put into effect some plan whereby true amateurs (a toy maker?) are thrown on their own w/gobs of cash to hunt & destroy those responsible?? And what did they expect? to be able to return to normal life without any possible reprisal? Also, I feel that the Grand Master Steven Spielberg must frighten his editing team, as they seem unable to do their job.",5,0,5,31 May 2006
