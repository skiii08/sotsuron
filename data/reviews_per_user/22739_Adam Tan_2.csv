The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch is as good as its viewer
","The Blair Witch Project is absolutely brilliant in that it affords each individual viewer his or her own film. Because the filmmakers allow us to imagine what we will during the films very creepy quiet and dark moments, we are frightened by that in our imaginations which truly scares us. A common movie ploy is to have some sort of demon use its victim's innermost fears against them. In this case, however, it is not only the characters undergoing this, but also the audience. The greater the viewer's imagination and the more willing the viewer is to give himself over to it, the more he will enjoy the Blair Witch Project.",7,1,3,17 August 1999
Titanic," Worst Best Picture winner- EVER!!
","I have an idea- let's take the greatest disaster in maritime history and make a love story out of it. What's next, LOVE OVER LOCKERBIE SCOTLAND or perhaps HINDENBURG, THE LOVE STORY. The screenplay reads like a Sidney Sheldon novel, alternating between syrup and sap- while, oh by the way, lots of people are dying. TITANIC is the most overappreciated bunch of schlocky dreck to hit the screen since GONE WITH THE WIND. It's an all-out attack on the emotions by a hack director (albeit a big-budget hack director). It could have been so much more, maybe even a study of the horror that must have been that fateful night. A true talent could have given us multi-dimensional characters and- if the love story angle must persist- could have actually made the love triangle interesting or, God forbid, UNIQUE! Instead, we have the tired film cliche of the nice girl engaged (against her will) to an unspeakably unscrupulous, wealthy and unbearable man when along comes- aawww- a kind hearted, but down on his luck artist. Was anything original about this tribute to movie special effects and technical innovation? NO! It's more of the same James Cameron junk we've seen time and time and time again- explosions one-dimensional characters spewing forth ridiculously saccharine dialogue while the music tells us how to feel. I didn't much like this movie, in case I haven't been clear enough.",3,2,3,28 December 2000
