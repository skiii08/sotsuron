50 First Dates," Kudos.
","The first time I watched this I didn't like it much because I thought it was cheap and lame, but the second time I watched it, I found myself crying quite at times, laughing at times, and I immediately fell in love with it. This film is very heart-warming and comical at the same time, what more would you want in a film? A teary moment followed by a laughing moment to rid of the tears is just what you need. Drew and Adam were the perfect actress and actor for this film as Drew has a vulnerable feature about her and Adam takes the role of trying to take care of her. I love the ending, although it doesn't seem anything like reality, as if a woman woke up one morning and watched a tape of herself getting married and had no memory of it at all, wouldn't she react instead? All in all I'd say this film was brilliant.",9,0,0,3 January 2007
