United 93," Interesting and Provocative
","I am a United States Naval Sailor. So the views that I am about to portray might be one sided, but I will honestly give you a view from my perspective. I have been to Iraq twice now since the events of 9/11 and this movie really made me think.My first emotion when i was through viewing this film was rage. I was upset at everyone. I was mad of course at the terrorist and the length they would go to strike fear into us. But i was also enraged with the readiness of the USAF. They somehow were not able to send an effective strike group at these planes until it was all too late. I was upset at the timely matter it took for them to get clearance from the President. I'm not as mad at the president as i am with our system. Somehow, in this most timely hour, they were unable to get hold of him. You would think that the chain of command in our US of A would be strong enough and trained enough to be able to get the info to and from where they needed it. But somehow, this could not be accomplished.The movie itself kept me quiet the whole time. I really began to think they were gonna be able to overcome the obstacles, even knowing the final outcome. And the people calling their love ones actually brought a tear to my eyes.Was America ready for a 9/11 movie? I don't know. But I can fully tell you, that this movie was not Hollywood. There's no love scene, or special character that makes you focus on there situation. Its almost a dramatization of a documentary.The actors who are not big name, did a fabulous job of making me believe they were just ordinary people, and nothing special.Bravo Zula to United 93",9,5,10,30 April 2006
