Gremlins," great 80's horror comedy about little monsters
","I really liked this movie. For a movie made in the 1980's the effects were very good. The acting was great and the gremlins are hilarious. The comedy really works the way so many other movies have tried to work (and failed). Its squadron of knock-offs are entertaining but not as good, My favorite being Critters. Critters also works but still, it was not as good a movie. The others being: Ghoulies, Ghoulies II, Ghoulies III, Ghoulies IV, Munchies, and I guess Troll. Gremlins also had a sequel, which declined in quality. I think it could have a 3rd installment as long as it didn't go computer animation. Gremlins is the type of movie that can be seen again and again and doesn't get old . So I totally recommend it for everyone 10+.",8,0,1,20 May 2013
