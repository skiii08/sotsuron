Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Youth Target Dulls Movie
","Somewhere the Menace got lost.  The movie lacked the evil of Empire Strikes Back and was more along the lines of an Ewok Adventure.  Some things in this movie don't make sense. For example, in the other three we had Men in suits - Storm Troopers.  In this movie we got legions of Robots and Ships are much cooler than the X-Wings in IV,V and VI.Jar Jar was annoying and was neither funny or wise 'Peoples gunna die ?!'",6,0,1,16 August 1999
