Blade Runner 2049," Goes through all the motions of a good movie but has no meat on it
","As someone I know said, this is a 'cargo cult movie'. It has all the exterior of what a great Blade runner sequel would look like but there is little underneath. Visuals are stunning, music and sound are good, camera work is as it should be, but when you get down to its core, there's little there. I am not usually the one to complain about a slow pacing or a plot that requires some suspense of belief, but here It seems they serve as a way to achieve the deep and philosophical feel without actually being either. Acting overall is mediocre at best, actors fail to convincingly relay emotion of the characters, that are themselves written quite shallow, unrelatable and one dimensional. There are some interesting questions raised by the plot, the whole thing is far from a total disaster, but nothing is explored deep enough or clearly enough to be truly interesting or engaging. That's why this movie is going to be remembered just as a sequel to it's famous original.",5,66,134,10 October 2017
Annihilation," One giant plot hole with a bit of fun sticking out here and there
","This movie barely kept me from quitting half way through, and I really rarely quit movies half way through. It has some interesting visuals, there are bits of fun here and there, but overall narrative is just incoherent mess to the point where I have to wonder what were the people who thought it was a good idea on. From the characters that are totally undeveloped and basically have no personality at all, to the sciency techno babble that has zero internal logic it's all just bad. Don't waste your time or money on this one.",3,6,11,6 May 2018
Alien: Covenant," Makes Alien resurrection seem like a masterpiece
","As I'm concerned, this is not a movie at all. This is a shitload of CGI slapped over an excuse for a story. And a bad excuse it is.I am all for the suspension of belief, and will not usually complain about plot holes as much as some people, but this plot is one big plot hole. Supposedly well trained astronauts act like mindless panicked civilians, go about a strange planet with organic life without any protection, ignore any quarantine protocols, ignore basic safety measures and endanger lives of thousands of colonists to radio their spouse etc. Interstellar ship gets damaged by a random sun flare like those kind of events are totally unknown to engineers of the future, random radio transmissions from a distant planet get picked up by chance... It's a mess. The characters themselves are totally flat, to the point where any emotional impact of their situation is totally lost. Guy gets eaten by alien? Well at least it looked kind of pretty. Talking about aliens, they tried to put aliens from Prometheus and old style aliens in the same movies, making both kind of pointless.Scenes themselves look very good, but that's the only positive thing that can be said about them. Bad acting, horrible story and the lack of finesse makes it all feel kind of empty and uninteresting. All in all, you'll spend much better time watching first two movies for the 1000'th time then watching this cr*p. You'll even have better time watching Alien resurrection then this. Avoid at all costs!",2,2,4,28 August 2017
