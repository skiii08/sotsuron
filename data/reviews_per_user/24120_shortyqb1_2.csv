Source Code," Suspense. Great mind bending thriller
","I came into this expecting a decent thriller, that would likely be predictable, guess I was wrong, it will keep you guessing. Anyone who enjoys movies such as Inception, Adjustment Bureau, Deja Vu... Anything of that nature, you will love this movie, go into it with an open mind, watch it with detail, and it will keep you guessing the ENTIRE time, just one of those movies that kind of leaves you sitting there thinking........................ The bad reviews on this are gonna come from two kinds of people, people that don't like to think critically, and people who are unwilling to watch movies with an open mind. At the end of the day, SEE IT! You will not be disappointed",8,1,3,1 November 2011
The Town," Charlestown's Finest. Affleck directs a gem
","For me this movie had everything I hoped it would have and more, I'm not usually a big Ben Affleck fan at all, but he actually produced a good character, with the exception of the changes his accent makes every scene. Jeremy Renner stole the show in my mind, his character was very well done, and he executed the role perfectly, really got into his character, great actor. Something else I really appreciated about this movie was the execution of the action scenes, the chase scenes in general. It seems like in Hollywood these days action seems are all way overdone, the town provided a perfect balance. Final verdict, very solid movie",9,0,0,29 October 2011
