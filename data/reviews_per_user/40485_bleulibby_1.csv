Hereditary," I mean as far as movies go...
","These days with horror genres we can't expect much . They're following The Exorcist , Hellraiser , Nightmare on Elm , Halloween , Candyman, 13 Ghosts , and the like. This movie had no creep factor no scare , no eerie portions . It's a long drawn out film that leaves something to be desired and if you're a horror enthusiast leaves you wanting more . There's no gore no jump out of your seat really no nothing . They tried to put too much storyline into a the film and it's not good . It's not awful it's just not an actual horror film . The preview was misleading . There's nothing to it . A lady loses her mom then her daughter and that's oretty much a wrap .",3,0,1,28 August 2018
