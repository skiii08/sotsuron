Angels & Demons," Exceptional Thriller
","Was excited at the opening to hear part of 'Chevaliers De Sangreal' but wanted more so I bought said Hans Zimmer piece. Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minutes of music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even w/o the religious considerations. You get to tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN where the 'God Particle' or largest quantity of Antimatter is created with STUNNING visuals is an immediate clue which foretells the excellence of this movie. Who doesn't love Hanks? The storyline and twists in this film are just superb and well drawn out until the amazingly twisted climax. This film suggests a satisfying compromise between Science and Religion though plenty of closed heads will persist on both sides. 'Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.' A.Einstein",10,8,16,26 May 2009
Orphan," Hitchcock-Esquire Thriller
","Watched this expecting a so-so remake of 'Bad Seed The' but was Very surprised and glad how wrong I was. You already know its abut adoption and the child is bad but that does not even begin to scratch the surface of this MAJOR spine chiller. 'Silence of the Lambs' creepy? 8MM creepy? Big yes, but in a different way this is creepier. No shat, really. The major surprise is so mind blowing I was stunned! This movie and story is worthy of Alfred Hitchcock. Let me give you my definition of creepy: plausible but extremely unusual and SO NOT anticipated, it's freaky. Some of the violence is awful, but the major surprise in this really messes with your head. The execution and direction of this is shockingly good.",10,4,9,17 October 2009
Shutter Island," Shuttered Awareness
","Scorsese scores again! Shutter Island is a great mystery thriller deserving even of Hitchcock, though Scrosese is a great director. IMO Decaprio has become a great actor. Was skeptical of him 12 or so years ago, but he is in many excellent movie since then. In SI you are observing point-of-view from within insanity. What you have to figure out in this movie is which person(s) are insane. While I checked the 'spoiler' box, the outcome will NOT be spoiled here. Altered mental states make for difficult understanding especially when that POV is expertly directed. This is a favorite technique of David Lynch (Mulholland Drive prime example) but IMO, Scorsese has done it so masterfully in Shutter Island that even at the end when all the 'evidence' is in, you will still find it difficult to believe. Depcaprio and Ruffalo are superb in this film. Methinks Scorsese and Decaprio deserve Oscars. This is a VERY excellent film.",10,1,6,8 March 2010
Bird Box," BirdBox - Creepiest Unexplained Film in History
",This movie is very interesting and captures your attention with its excellent premise. Something in various parts of the world that people see is causing them to kill themselves an/or others. It is well played by Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich and others and quite believable. I give this 7 stars only because the 'creepsters' are never actually seen by the viewer and ARE NEVER explained either. This is a typical Stephen King or J.J. Abrams thing in their movies. For anyone who wants a completeness about their movie(s) it is extremely annoying - even more so the more unlikely the story is.,7,1,4,23 December 2018
Burn After Reading," Burn your money elsewhere
","Go figure! Malkovich, Swindon, Clooney, McDormand, Pitt. All great players in many great movies. Coen brothers, writer/directors of great movies. 8.1 on IMDb before I saw this. Fooled again. Saw today with and audience of about 30. Average age appeared about 40. Only a few laughs in this misadventure and that among the whole audience. Worst waste of major talent I've ever seen! Entertaining in a quaint way. Only thing I can figure is generation-Y is rating this so high. Here's the spoiler: Its BORING! How could so many people rate this so high? Is the world population now so desperate for entertainment? Though the Coen brothers have made some great movies, this is NOT one of them. They are no longer a trusted source for me.",4,5,9,20 September 2008
Knowing," Knowing Best Etertainment is My Forte
","Nicholas is great again. After loving 'Next', was absolutely thrilled by Knowing. OK, a die-hard rationalist has his heart and mind opened by irrefutable evidence of the supernatural. OK, a bunch of weirdo looking guys are appearing at various times which is spooky and misleading. But when the apocalypse nears and Cage is crying saying goodbye to his son, who cannot be heavily moved? ESPECIALLY as the 'Wheels of Ezekiel' have just appeared. This cannot possibly be a coincidence in the visual. Writer/Director MUST have been familiar with the Hebrew prophet. After seeing this fantastic film I am forever Knowing that it is wonderful and amongst my 500 favorites (out of over 5,000). If you have no imagination, no lust for truth, science and heavenly reality, this is not recommended. Otherwise, highly.",10,2,8,26 May 2009
District 9," Yayyyyy Aliens!
","At first the shaky camera thing seemed dismaying. Gigantic alien ship hovering over Africa for months then we humans forcing our way in to find 1000's of 'worker' bee aliens. OK, so the leaders had died is the explanation. So we build a slum tenement for them then treat them like bugs and call them Prawns because they look like humanoid shrimp. Your heart goes out immediately for them. Even the 'nice' guy that interfaces with them for the eviction is a prick, at least until he understand their predicament from experience. The intelligent alien and his son are VERY endearing and capture much more sorrow from me than any human in the movie. Heck, the aliens even have greedy pawn brokers preying on them. One sad scene is when the military industrial complex is testing one of their weapons on a Prawn and the poor thing is looking around with fear. Pretty funny that the Prawn love eating cat food. Effects in this are stunning, action is compelling, though this is a rooster film and the chicks will enjoy it less. Pretty violent and gooey. It really captures and holds on to your interest. Particularly tantalizing is when you realize (from visuals) that these 'dumb' alien bugs are actually far advanced over humans in their technology. This will obviously have a sequel. Can't wait.",10,1,3,24 August 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Twilight 2: Mooning the Fans.
","In in my 50's and am an escapist meaning I do not try to 'Break' movies but am incredulous about this one. Since I liked the 1st one, had to see this too. Overall the effects were excellent, the plot generally good. OK, cutie Bella lives near some woods and she is a helluva monster attractor. Vampires were acceptable to me, but she also attracts werewolves? Are you efing shatting me? WTF? This is for 7 year olds! Her friend of many years Jacob, all of a sudden turns out to be a werewolf, but he was born that way? First movie and much of this shows him as normal then confuses the viewer with his Lycanthropy. ARE YOU SHATTING ME? I was in an audience with about average age of 20 overall and many ppl besides me were laughing at scenes that WERE NOT intended to be funny. One spoiler not given away here is the very last line of the movie which is funnier than hail! Really, when everyone else is laughing, then I'm less concerned about offending the others by laughing. Again cool FX, good plot though poorly executed and some unintended bonus chuckles.",6,0,4,21 November 2009
Paranormal Activity," Paranormal Theater Success
","My confessional. Got suckered into seeing this by all the hype. Read many reviews in here and ignored the majority of them that called it lame. Yup. Very lame. Little character development, little ambiance and little effects. OK, this is supposed to be an amateur video and that shows. Production company didn't even spend a few thousand for titles. Not bad for an amateur video, but lousy for a theatrical release. At least one brain-dead protoplasmic moron in here compared it to the Exorcist and even Hitchcock. NO WAY! The people that own this must be laughing all the way to bank that this piece of crap is grossing big. Blair Witch was WAY better than this. B or even C horror movies are better. I had NO, 0, Nada sympathy for the characters and as for running from the theater screaming- it must've been to demand their money back. TV's ghost chasers is probably better. You've been warned...",2,17,32,7 November 2009
Avatar," Astonishing Cinema
","Read many comments in here before seeing this and they were spot on. This film is so beautiful and stunning it defies belief. Felt to me like seeing a film hundreds of years in the future. Story line is great and the Nav'i capture your heart very strongly. Avatar has taken movie creatures and special effects many, many steps forward. Some people have likened this to Dances With Wolves and there is a simple parallel but it is a great understatement. Telling folks about this verbally I simply say 'words cannot convey.' It is fairly long but so engrossing that one does not notice. It is so incredibly good, I will be shocked if it does not reach top 20 of all time in here. Saw it without the 3D and imagine that in 3D it would just simply blow the audience's brains clean out of their skulls. Indeed this film is a landmark and a new one to beat. Cannot imagine that happening anytime soon. Bravo, bravo, bravo!",10,5,11,19 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Old Hag-Bag from Hell!
","This movie needs a new category: Horror, Thriller, Comedy. There is so many over-the-top scenes in this I could not stop laughing. Early in the movie this vile, filthy, disgusting old beach from hell shows up at the bank for another extension on her defaulted loan. Was unable to count how many colors of slime were coming out of her mouth, nose and ears. On top of that, her fingernails looked like solid fungus matter! The young lady turns her down and the old hag curses her and I think even her glass eye became lit up. So, this old fossil from the lower rungs of hell hides in the girl's car and attacks her when she's going home. This fight scene alone won me over for the whole movie. Old hag is choking the girl from the back seat and the girl guns the car then hits another car and the momentum throws the old beach from the back seat into the front, hitting the dashboard and knocking her rotten slimy false teeth out. The girl jams a ruler into her throat and the bag chokes on it SO HARD it is ejected and goes clean through the driver side window! Are you shatting me? After the rotten bag from walmart hell dies, her ghost appears physically in the girl's shed and again is choking her and the girl cuts a rope holding an anvil up above about 12 feet. The anvil comes down and squashes the hag's head off and the eyeballs pop out hitting the girl in the face. What more could you ask for in horror comedy? Have only scratched the surface here. This is well produced and has many surprises. Very entertaining.",Null,7,12,9 October 2009
Zombieland," Killing UnDead for Sport
","Was disappointed in this though considered it fairly entertaining. Particularly good was the Bill Murray sequence. My biases are that I'm a huge fan of the 'Dead' movies (over 200 now, maybe?) but prefer the 'better' ones (Romero) over the low-budget ones. The basic fun is being immune to killing of humans, since the 'dead' are no longer human. Am also a huge Woody Harrelson fan and he delivers in this. Usually in this genre, the lead characters eventually become overwhelmed by the dead and are consumed but that's a surprise in this one. Maybe my sensibilities are 'deadened' but this just seemed to drag on with more of the usual same-O. Surprises in store for Twinkie lovers. Am still waiting for many dead movies to be made: The Melancholy Dead, The Anorexic Dead, Bored Dead, Rehabilitated Dead, Hypnotized Dead, Brain Dead, Finally Dead Dead, Time Traveling Dead, Prehistoric Dead, Emotionally Dead Dead to name a few. Stay Tuned.",7,0,1,14 October 2009
Prometheus," 2093 A Creation Odyssey
","Having read through a few hundred of the reviews on this it would seem prudent to state up front my misgivings. While I agree with some of the statements about the writing and others about the stupidity, I must say that this is still magnificently spellbinding! Have not felt this great of 'mystery excitement' since 2001 A Space Odyssey in late 60's. Some parts were not clear to me, but the overall theme was enthralling. It was actually insulting to see 'Alien' horror in this as it is so cerebral the horror seemed out of place. One bit of stupidity on the biologist's part is unforgivable. When the biologist is attempting to 'pet' the embryo-Suppositor you feel like giving a Darwin award when he gets thrashed. I thought the holographs were interesting but a little annoying. One would think that beings capable of creating WMD Aliens would make clear playbacks, not ghostly outlines. This movie was cool beyond belief!",10,4,12,12 June 2012
