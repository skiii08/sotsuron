The Blair Witch Project," Not as good as the hype.
","I didn't think the movie was that scary.  It might have had more of an impact on me, if I hadn't listened to all of the hype.  If you've read the reviews and listened to the hype, there is nothing surprising about the movie.  And the jerky camera motions aren't for the weak stomached.  I had to leave the theater twice to catch my breath and keep from vomiting.  The acting is good, but I wouldn't recommend the movie to most people.",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Excellent, One of the Best of all time
","What an excellent movie!!!  This has to be one of the best of all time. Morgan Freeman is excellent as always.  Tim Robbins was superb.  I've always believed Robbins was a decent actor, but he superceded any expectations I had.  The movie is a real feel good movie.  I recommend it for anyone over 15.",Null,1,2,20 January 1999
