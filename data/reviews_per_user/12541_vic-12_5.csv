Capote," There but for the grace of God...
","This is a riveting movie about the dark side of human nature. Why was Truman Capote so drawn to the multiple, apparently senseless killings in rural Kansas? All the reviewers miss this deep meaning, but I can tell you the deep dark secret, never mentioned, but inescapable is--- THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD GO I.Capote identifies with the killers, especially Perry, who is also from the south, also abandoned by his mother and ultimately raised in an orphanage, where we presume he had the usual care, abuse and neglect. Capote had a similar abandoning mother ('we were both abandoned by our mothers'), but at least had the saving grace of being raised by a relative, an aunt. Probably his childhood had a modicum of love and security, but just the bare minimum, as Capote can identify with 'cold blood.' He also identified with Perry's creativity, as he was literate and artistic. After hearing Perry's childhood story, he said, 'we were raised in the same house, and one day you went out the back door and I went out the front.' This was the most telling moment in understanding their connection.In a way, Capote was as cold-blooded as Perry, using him to write the story that would make him famous and earn him a goldmine. He was shown to have two faces, the sympathetic one toward Perry, gaining his trust and finally getting the details of the killing to end his book, and the other, the egomaniacal entertainer at Manhattan parties. He went from eccentric to an out of control alcoholic, but he was always discreet, never getting falling down drunk, but always sipping a drink. His writer friends were concerned for him but there was nothing they could do, nothing anyone could do.The closing credits said he died in 1984 from the complications of alcoholism, but Ebert wrote that he died of an overdose. I figure he ultimately could not live with himself or his memories, knowing that just under the surface, he was a cold blooded murderer too.And such is the human condition, that some emerge from a traumatic childhood and become an overt monster, and some emerge from a traumatic childhood, an eccentric celebrity, fiendishly brilliant, and a covert monster.Audiences will be drawn to this by the millions and will be affected by viewing this, because all of us have a dark side. We can identify and there but for the grace of God go I!",8,1,1,25 February 2006
The Pianist," The most intense, vivid, graphic and poignant Holocaust film yet!
","I thought there could be no Holocaust movie after 'Schindler'sList,' because... what more could be said, described... the horrors,the brutality, the random cruelty, the savagery, the relentlessmurders of the Final Solution.  'Schindler's List' had a redemptiveending, a message of hope, but 'The Pianist,' although muchmore grim, still found a way for art, as embodied in the culture ofmusic, to find a common language for Nazi and Jew.  Polanskicreated a cinematic work of art of the first order, which I am surewill become a classic.  The acting performance of the Spijlmancharacter was incredible, of the highest order.  The film drags theviewer bodily into the nitty-gritty of the Holocaust, taking him/her ona harrowing journey from upper middle class comfort and cultureto one dispossession after another, leaving countless Jews bereftof possessions, self-respect, family, security, honor, loyalty andultimately life itself.  There are numerous examples ofcollaboration, capitulation, defiance, embattlement andunbelievable courage and luck.  I hope writers, playwrights andfilm-makers never stop reminding us of what happened in Europeduring World War II.  If we don't remember history, we will truly becondemned to repeat it.  Hopefully it will never happen again that apeople will be subject to genocide.  The unwritten message is thatmusic is the saving grace and common language of civilization.",10,0,1,13 January 2003
Rules of Engagement," The film is much more relevant today than two years ago...
","I saw the film last night on cable and was caught up with the theme of terrorism in the Middle East.  Two years ago 9/11 hadn't happened and the Arab-Israeli conflict was not white-hot.  Today, the film bristles with the energy of the mortal conflict between the West and East. 
The story is about one Marine colonel trying to defend another, an old war buddy from Vietnam, from a wrongful charge of murder for firing into a crowd of so-called civilians, killing a large number of men, women and children. Today we call it 'collateral damage.'  The movie shows that the attack was necessary, as the raging crowd was armed and firing at the embassy, killing three marines.  The colonel on trial finally ordered his men to fire on the crowd, which to the viewing audience seemed the only sensible and logical thing to do.  The following day there were all these bodies and no weapons, but the story was that the weapons were removed to give the impression that the 'peaceful' demonstrators were unarmed.  The head of the National Security Agency was more interested in catering to world opinion than in backing up the American armed forces, which risked their lives to rescue the embassy personnel, which they successfully did.The film is about how cynical politicians don't care a fig about the men who risk their lives to save them and keep them secure, only caring about their own image and reputation.  And so it is a movie about the betrayal of fighting men by amoral politicians.  The prosecuting marine attorney is rabid and ruthless in pursuing the murder charge, claiming the colonel violated the 'rules of engagement.' Tommy Lee Jones gallantly tries to defend his war buddy friend, with whom he had a prior bloody fisticuffs battle when he realizes there are no witnesses, contrary to what he had been told.  The case was tougher than he expected, and he didn't feel up to the job in the first place, but he took on this life or death legal contest out of friendship and loyalty and a strong feeling of responsibility.  So the film turns out to be a morality tale, the good guys versus the bad guys.Similarly, with echoes to the present Middle East and terrorist conflict of today, the Muslims are depicted as clever, lying and barbaric, covering up their own role in inciting the massacre.  When Tommy Lee Jones was in Yemen, looking for witnesses and evidence, he was surrounded by an angry crowd and almost beaten to death.  They hated Americans and called him a murderer.Fast forward to the trial, the defense attorney knew there was a video camera pointing at the place where the crowd was, that would have shown if they had weapons or not.  The movie shows that the videotape was deliberately destroyed by the National Security chief, a slick and smooth talker, who convinced the ambassador to lie about being rescued by the marines.  He and his wife were both eyewitnesses and the defense attorney never subpoenaed them because he knew they would perjure themselves.Ebert and Berardinelli criticized the ending as weak and inconclusive, but the ending did not bother me.  What did bother me after the fact was learning that the captions at the end, stating that the colonel was vindicated and the National Security chief caught with his coverup and suspended, was false and fictional, giving the wrong impression that this was a true story.  That is unforgiveable because I thought it was a true story, but I'm glad the story was concocted in the first place, because these things do happen, and we need to know about them.  Better to be informed by facts than fiction, but sometimes fiction informs where facts are lacking.Shakespeare's historical plays were full of factual inaccuracies, but the basic facts of greed, lust for power, betrayal of trust, self-aggrandizement, uncontrolled rage and waging war for stupid reasons remain universal truths of the human condition and dramas about them are both informative and entertaining, reminding us of things we would just as soon forget.So I'll raise Ebert's and Berardinelli's 2 1/2* to *** and recommend the film for those who enjoy courtroom dramas and those who long to see truth, honor and justice prevail over cynicism, betrayal and dishonor.",Null,1,2,7 August 2002
Thirteen Days," The Cuban Missle Crisis--- or how we avoided WWIII
","As a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst I have been interested in how this group of national security people actually negotiated with the Soviets in such a way that a nuclear holocaust was prevented.  I had heard there were cool heads and hot heads, hawks and doves battling for their point of view.  Each side thought they were right and had the best interests of the nation at heart.  It could be seen as a 13 day marathon (therapy) in which the group leader, John F. Kennedy, found a way to avoid extreme and dangerous differences, especially with the help of his brother, Robert and a close aid and friend, Ken O'Donnell.  The latter role was taken by Kevin Kostner, and although the excellent movie critic James Berardinelli thought that was a mistake, (they should have focussed more on JFK and Bobby) I thought it useful to have a person without power, but with perspective, that the audience could identify with.  As a result, we had the privilege of being the 'fly-on-the-wall' at secret meetings in which the fate of the world hung in the balance.  It didn't bother me that the story was not a documentary--- these exist and can be used for comparison.13 Days was very well acted, directed, edited and photographed, with ample display of then current military planes, ships and rockets.  The Oval Office was reportedly painstakingly reproduced, as well as actual television news accounts at the time.  And throughout there was a dramatic sprinkling of shots of nuclear bombs going off, a reminder of what was at stake.From this perspective, I can see why the world has avoided a nuclear confrontation from the early 60's till now, almost 40 years later.  As a result we owe the Kennedy brothers and MacNamara much appreciation for protecting us from nuclear disaster.  The film made good use of showing us what was at stake, families and children playing in peace, being prosperous and secure.  It was good to see these men of influence having moral values and caring for their families, despite their many reported personal lapses.You can see why the nation recently gave high approval ratings to Bill Clinton in spite of the Lewinsky scandal.  Like Kennedy before him, his personal hero, Clinton was handsome, articulate, intelligent and charismatic, the ultimate politician.  One can only wonder how Clinton would have dealt with a nuclear showdown.",Null,0,0,15 January 2001
