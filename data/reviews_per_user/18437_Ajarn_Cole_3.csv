50 First Dates," Increbible friendship...
","I've watched this movie several times and I must say that it is a wonderful song of friendship, and awakening love. The multiple angles, or facets, are that it shows us friendship in itself has many forms. I've seen almost every movie from Adam AND Rob, and these two guys are always supporting each other. If I had a friend like these two have in each other I would be living a dream.Also, Sean Astin was accused of having a 'homosexual' relationship with Elijah Wood because they had such a close relationship while filming Lord of The Rings. Subsequent clips of the movie LOTR, which showed how close they were as friends, is meaningful to the word friendship. If America, AND the rest of the 'western world', would have this kind of closeness, there would be more peace in the world. I would like to rejoice in these forward thinkers of showing that friendship is what makes the bonding of life meaningful and special. Thank you Adam, Rob, Sean, and Elijah for showing the rest of the world how important true friendship is. Do NOT allow those closed-minded people to rule what true friendship means! You are, in my opinion, leaders of the future.I love all your movies, and may they continue to bring levity, happiness, and change to our world. KUDOS!!And as for Drew Barrymore, she is a TRUE inspiration for everyone!! I've watched this beautiful young woman grow from a child through her troubled youth to become an inspiration for all people. Like Ms. Barrymore, I had a problem with fighting my desires for substance abuse, and she was one of my lights to overcome this horrid problem. Today I hold her as one of the brightest stars in the sky. How wonderful to have such lights to shine for everyone to see. YEA!!",8,0,0,12 October 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Definitely a great remake...
","When the original movie, Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, came out I was 10 years old. I loved and watched it many times while it was in the theater. It has always been a great movie and the only person in the world who could have remade it is Tim Burton. He is a true visionary of our time, and I've loved every movie he's ever made.Something I noticed while watching this movie is the number of return actors that are willing to go with Tim in any movie he asks them for. I'll bet there is a line of actors waiting to be in his movies. I know I would be in that line if I was an actor. :-)Additionally Johnny Depp is 'The Man' in movies. He is so talented and can act in any genre. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are just awesome together!!Like MadMax says, this may sound like a commercial but take your entire family and their friends to see this wonderful movie. It is definitely an original from the original. 8 out of 10 stars for me!",8,2,3,7 October 2005
RED," Once I saw the all star cast....
","I knew this movie was going to be good once I saw all the big players, but DANG! It simply blew me away! Great action with comedy in just the right places. I was on the roller-coaster in the 1st few minutes and rode it all the way home.While I've pretty much always been a fan of Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman rides in my Top 5 list of Actors. He certainly keeps in that top 5 list in this movie.And two other huge numbers, Dame Helen Mirren and John Malkovich! WOW! Both of these top-notch actors continue like gang-busters, again, holding true to their ratings as great entertainers of the silver screen.Totally one of the best movies of 2010.",10,1,2,31 January 2011
