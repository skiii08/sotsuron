Blade Runner 2049," I came, I saw, I smiled - BladeRunner Outshines
","I wanted to believe the hype, i truly did - don't get me wrong though, the movie was great, the effects and the scenery was amazing; the movie in itself had a peculiar simple message;' Believe in Love and Miracles will happen '.For Hollywood to tell a tale about love nowadays is unique, even more uncommon to tell it with a huge franchise since most of them are destroyed by clueless, uneducated and privileged writers who lacks the imagination and creativity to write a simple tale about a virtue or any virtue; writing a story isn't hard, it just takes time and dedication to understand the purpose and meaning of a story, and it isn't subjective.If you want to see a love story in a sci-fi environment;' Its great '. If you want to see an action movie;' Its great '. if you want it to be a BladeRunner sequel,then I'm gonna be honest and say; 'It is' - but is it the greatest movie of the year for me; 'No'.It is a great movie to see with your friends or with your partner and it has a little of everything for everybody to leave with a smile.",8,6,12,13 October 2017
