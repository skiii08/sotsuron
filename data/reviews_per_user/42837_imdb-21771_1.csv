Hereditary," not for horror lovers
","My advice: do not go to Hereditary. Horrible script, not scary and the feeling that we got fooled by marketing. The cast is good, but it's not for the first time we read good stories about a movie that's boring and cannot live up to the expectations. We see circa 20 horror movies per year and this one ends somewhere at the bottom of our list.",6,0,3,2 August 2018
