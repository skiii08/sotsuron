Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," dire
","This is perhaps the only film I've ever voted a 1 out of 10 at IMDb, and the reason for giving it 1 is that there isn't a '0' option.The effects are overdone and distracting. Lipsync of non-human characters is so poor that it's like watching Sesame Street or some low budget TV sci-fi show.The sound is LOUD, so loud in fact that it did keep many of our 10pm showing audience awake.Save your money, skip this turkey.",1,4,8,24 May 1999
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," A bit like Eurovision itself. Cringeworthy but you persevere anyway.
",Typical Will Ferrell hamming it up.If you can get past that it's everything you'd expect from one of his movies.Rachel McAdams does well everywhere but looking the same age as Will.,6,11,23,27 June 2020
Aquaman," Gave up
",Watched about half the movie on blue ray and then switched it off. Luckily it was a $2 special rental.The story was a yawnfest and the underwater vocals too weird to get used to.I feel sorry for the cast who would have been doing their best in front of a green screen and unaware of how dire the end product was going to turn out.,2,1,2,23 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Utterly predictable, stale and forgettable
",I'm just so over epic battles fought with energy beams coming out of hero and villain. Come on writers give us something new.,6,6,13,4 May 2020
Fargo," Hype
",This movie does not live up to the hype. It's ok but nothing special.,6,0,0,29 July 1998
The Thing," Perfection
","When I first saw this film in the late 80s it scared the #!*% out of me. Horror, suspense and terror at its best.Woo hoo, I just noticed it's scheduled for a September DVD release. As Meg Ryan would say, yes, yes, Yes, Yes, YES!!I hope it's as good as the memories I have of it  :-)",9,2,6,28 July 1998
The Exorcist," Still banned on video in the UK
","The Exorcist is still banned on video in the UK (go figure) so it was only recently that I was able to get a copy on DVD and see what all the fuss was about.Mark Kermode (BBC Radio 1 film critic) thinks this film is the best thing since sliced bread. For an early 70s horror film the effects are exceptional, but the story just isn't that scary and none of the film's images came back to play games with my mind.I could easily have fallen asleep to this one, but wish I'd seen it in my teens when it would have had more impact.",7,0,1,28 July 1998
Pearl Harbor," Pass the sick bag
","This film is three hours long and about one and a half hours too long.Apart from the never ending story, some of the lowlights in the 3 hours are:Jon Voight (Roosevelt) - lacked any emotion delivering what should have been a stirring speech.Alec Baldwin (Doolittle) - his character was straight out of the Hollywood guide to over patriotic military superiors. Can't blame Alec for the absurd dialog he was given.Before the attack some RAF guy panders to the US audience with 'God help anyone who goes to war with America'. For me, it all went downhill from there.",4,0,1,26 January 2002
Avengers: Endgame," Predictably forgettable
","Took an age to build up to the final battle where the solution merely involved jumping on Thanos and steeling the stones. You don't need world war 3 first to get to that point.Anyhow, hats off to the filmmakers for making so many people want to watch yet another mediocre story hidden behind shinny cgi.",4,50,80,13 August 2019
Saving Private Ryan," Good but not great
","The landing scenes are excellent and seem to make everyone think about the suffering that must have taken place. The rest of the the story is ok but not great, there's nothing there that hasn't been filmed a hundred times already. Definitely worth watching on a big screen with big sound.Having said that, I couldn't help thinking that it had many similarities with Starship Troopers. Lots of blood, guts, gore, big guns, evil faceless enemies, team bonding, battlefield documentary photography, landing craft invasions, 'tank' busting, and more.",8,0,0,15 September 1998
Scream 2," Too predictable
","Like the original, this movie just isn't scary or fun.I'll try to phrase this to avoid a spoiler; the surprise killer was hardly a surprise. I picked him/her out immediately because his/her character was introduced with the subtlety of a brick. It looked like an attempt to please audiences making a 2nd viewing, so they could then think 'ah, there was a clue there'. Well spotted Sherlock.This movie fails to scare because you just can't care about the characters. Kill 'em all and see if we care.And what's with a college campus running business as usual with a serial killer on the loose ?.yawn.   5/10",5,0,0,13 August 1998
Scream 2," Poor 2nd time around too.
","I watched this film again last night. This was my 2nd viewing of Scream 2. I didn't rate Scream 2 highly the first time and this repeat viewing several months later didn't change my mind.SPOILERS AHEAD, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED Scream 2.The female killer character's numerous appearances never fit into the feel of the rest of the film, she stands out like a sore thumb in all her scenes and may as well be wearing a 'I'm the killer' badge.I found myself laughing out loud when Sidney decides to run to a dark and empty theatre calling out 'is there anybody there?'. Come on, she has a serial killer chasing her and she chooses to go there of all places ??. And what's with this tough killer being scared by falling polystyrene props ?The whole thing is a joke from start to finish.",5,1,2,13 August 1999
It Chapter Two," Yawnfest
",Takes an age to get going and then is just a bunch of cliches and scenes we've all seen a thousand times.,3,0,2,10 June 2020
Scream," Almost
","Before I criticise, I'll first say that I enjoyed this film and think it is worth recommending, but...I wish someone would make a film that's as scary as the first ten minutes or so of Scream. The scenes involving Drew Barrymore were by far the best part of the film. The rest (on reflection) was a bit like a grown-ups version of Scooby Doo.If you want to calibrate my taste (and lack of), I prefer Wes' 'People Under the Stairs'. Enjoy the black comedy.",7,1,1,28 July 1998
