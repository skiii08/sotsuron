First Man," Fabulous
","I think this film got a little lost in the 2018 blockbusters and was overlooked by many people. I just saw it on Blu-Ray and LOVED it! Part meticulously-researched biopic, part epic space adventure -- and it's all true! This film takes you inside the cockpit of some of the most dangerous adventures mankind has ever undertaken. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack completes the atmopsphere. If you missed this one in 2018, don't miss it now. It's one of my favourite films in recent memory.",8,1,5,12 July 2019
Black Panther," Really good, unique, empowering film!
","Amazing, stunning, magnificent! Action scenes, acting chops (T'Challa, his sister, and his GF especially) were on point. FULL OF BADASSERY. Loved Martin Freeman's role too! Plenty of smart comic relief that made me BATMN. I dunno why I waited this long to see this! The story weaved a tale of the clash between the giving of service to the world VS the safety and security of one's own self, with a hero who had to overcome his own fears for his nation's safety and open his heart to the rest of the world, the outsiders who he didn't mind ignoring in the past. This really needs a sequel, though--for although he did what was right, there must be a tradeoff, and I didn't get to see the magnitude of the sacrifices yet (although I did get a taste of them) that are needed to flesh out the whole story.",8,1,5,12 July 2019
