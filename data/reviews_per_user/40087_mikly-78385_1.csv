Blade Runner 2049," Simply another excrescent sequel
","Once upon a time a splendid science fiction movie showed up in the theaters, based on the intelligent novel of the great writer Philipp K. Dick: Blade Runner! Although deservedly very successful, this unique masterpiece remained untroubled by any unnecessary sequel for 35 years.Meanwhile the science fiction genre has moved on. Very nice approaches showed up concerning AI, such as 'Ex Machina' and 'Her'. When the original 'Blade Runner' picked up the subject, long after the godfather of AI movies 'Metropolis' (1927) by Fritz Lang, it created an outstanding breathtaking cutting-edge vision of a future at stake, which needed not a single frame, a single word, a single tone more to have its role perfectly played. To show up with a sequel to a masterpiece is certainly a high risk. Almost all attempts have failed. This one failed completely as much as none of all sequels before have failed that I have seen. In fact it even has failed to be a mean movie at all when excluding the attempt of being a sequel: Reams of illogical settings and acting, poor dialogues, no pace, unimaginative landscapes, incoherent music, partly implausible roles, a dystopia where the questions of AI are odd an contrived. And, maybe the worst in case of a boring movie is: the length. To copy a great idea, to staple together some actors, frames and tones doesn't make a movie for a long time yet. This a failing movie as a movie and a disaster as a sequel. All in all I would recommend to everyone who loved the original and considers to go to cinema for this movie: Save your time! Rather get the original and watch that one, again and again, and you're much better off! While even after 35 years I still enjoy to remember every scene of 'Blade Runner', the scenes of '2049' will be forgotten next week, at the latest. Fortunately.",1,12,22,2 November 2017
