Saturday Night Fever," It looks different, now that I'm older - and that ain't good!
","I remember seeing this when it first came out. I was interested because, while I was in service at the time, off-duty I help run a disco music show at the NCO club in Germany. At the time, to my way of thinking then, I though it was a great movie. I loved the music.Over the years, I would remember some few scenes from this film - Tony and the guys horsing around on the bridge, the death of Bobby when he fell off that same bridge, the dancing, and the scene of Donna Pescow's character coming up to Tony with all those condoms that she had pulled out of her purse - simply because she was so desperate to get done by Tony.I just saw it again, over 30 years later. My goodness! I was a fool.This movie was absolutely awful. Sure, there was a plot, but it was shallow, just like the characters. Pescow's character was nothing more than a slut. She was pathetic. To his credit, Tony said just that (in bluer language), but he wasn't much better.It seemed that nobody could speak with foul language just spilling past their lips and into our ears - except for the fallen-away priest.In retrospect, this film just reeks. It was, by no means, a milestone, except to shove filmdom down a slippery slope that it has yet to recover from.",1,9,23,23 November 2010
Mamma Mia!," A cure for ABBA-itis.
","I happen to enjoy ABBA's music, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.If one was to judge ABBA's music by the deliveries in this movie, ABBA would get no more exposure. People would simply turn them off.I can imagine that some people thought it was brilliant casting to have Miss Streep as the mother and, especially inspired to have Pierce Brosnan in. I'm sure it looked good on paper.However, an idea is not always as good in the flesh as in the mind. Miss Streep had fun with this role. I'm glad that someone did. She will never be mistaken for a real singer, but she did hold her own, I guess.Pierce Brosnan, on the other hand, was WAY out of his element in this one. Wow! Did it show?! As a singer, he makes a great James Bond. I can imagine someone figured that, since Brosnan is Irish, he could do the role. Not all Irish can sing a beautiful tenor - or even sing, for that matter.The story itself was not all that hot, either. It is truly sad that this girl never knew who her father was, and even sadder that this was never resolved by the end of the film. The idea that her mother had no clue as to who was her daughter's father because she slept with all 3 candidates in such a short amount of time is not the food for comedy. It is fodder for tragedy, at least in the real world.Miss Balanski seems fated to only play cougar-women. Type casting? At least she could sing and - to a point - dance.Colin Firth got to play the requisite homosexual (Must there be one in every film?). However, I think this may be the one time that I can understand his character's decision to turn homosexual. After all he did sleep with Streep's character at one time.The final tragedy was that the young couple, when it came to crunch time, decide to forego marriage and just sail off around the world.How romantic! How wacked!",1,11,17,16 September 2010
The Mist," Not the worst...but
","I was looking forward to a Sci-fi movie that would be thrilling and, maybe, a cut above. To some extent, that is what I got.However, there was a lot more in this film that I wasn't expecting, and had no need for.While the special effects were good and the feeling of terror genuine, this film also took the time to launch into an anti-Christian tirade (what Hollywood movie doesn't do that, these days?). I forgot that this is one of Stephen Kings favorite subplots.Firstly, the proliferation of foul language was unnecessary and detracted from the movie. Surely, there are more than just a few people who are able to operate in a crisis situation without spouting curses with practically every other word.As an acting role, Marcia Harden did a splendid job of showing a quirky person who, in the face of unbearable pressure, quickly descends into madness. However, Stephen King saw fit to intertwine her descent into madness with Christianity, thereby embracing another false stereotype that Hollywood loves to indulge itself in. Mrs. Carmody was shown to, in one moment, spew the Old Testament and Revelation with equal spittle while, in the very next moment, spewing invectives and obscenities. The shallow characterization got so bad that, when she was shot by one of the store employees, several people in the theater cheered and clapped.Finally, the ending was, at best, convoluted. Yes, I can understand that these people did not want to die in the same manner that they had seen others die. However, at the time of their 'agreed upon' suicide/murder, they were not under any kind of attack. As a matter of fact, we learn just scant minutes later, that this is because the Army is moving in and driving the beasties back. Are you telling me that the people couldn't at least wait and see if they were going to be attacked? They had to die right then!?!? This could have been a better than average movie. I guess there is some consolation in the fact better it was better than The Langoliers. And now, it has Skyline to keep it from hitting bottom.",1,4,13,24 November 2007
I Am Legend," Will Smith is a tour de force in this movie!
","I was tremendously surprised when I saw this film. Will Smith is always capable and entertaining. His work in this film is his best, yet.Throughout the film, he moves through the full range of emotions required, and does it excellently. From his concerned father and husband trying to save his family, to his loner trying to keep his sanity with flip remarks, to his grieving over the loss of his last friend, to the final realization of his purpose in this crisis, Smith sets just the right tone, just the right stage.Ultimately, this is also a story of faith, loss of faith and the restoration of that faith. The family of Smith's character is obviously a religious one. His losses that lead to his being the last man are what makes him question his faith and to temporarily reject God.However, in the last moment, in that defining instant when he sees clearly what his purpose is in this whole tragedy, his faith is restored and, through it, he is steeled for that which he MUST do.Smith deserves an Oscar for this performance.",8,1,3,7 February 2008
Super 8," Epic Fail!
","This movie was Spielberg's lame attempt to recapture the so-called magic of E.T. Difference is, this time the alien was very ugly and mean.Just like with E.T,, the children in this movie all talked like sailors. Considering the language that was used, this probably an insult to sailors.Just like with most of Spielberg's movies, not a functional, normal family was in sight. Spielberg seems to believe that ALL children are like this. Of course, some are. However, not anywhere near as bad as he tends to portray them.Taking away the cuteness of ET and replacing it with a blood-thirsty alien, as well as a stereotypical blood-thirsty military contingent, took away what little was good about E.T. It made this movie just a shell.You wound up not caring about the creature, the children, heroes or the town itself.E.T.! Please, go home for good.",1,1,3,9 October 2012
Hancock," Nice idea but it went downhill fast!
","It's summer. It's time for a Will Smith blockbuster. Not this time.Mr. July blew it.This might have been a pretty decent movie. The acting was standard for this type of film. Even Jason Bateman was pretty good for his role, although a total surprise for casting. Charlize Theron is wonderful for the eyes while she is also a good actress. The ads were funny.Then the dialogue started.Alright, can someone tell me what is so funny about hearing the phrase 'A**H*LE' all those times in one movie? That doesn't even count all the other offensive and foul language that ran throughout the movie. At least the phrase (Crazy!) that flipped Mary's switch was one you could say in mixed company! They couldn't even show one of the scenes from the movie for their commercials without reediting the dialogue. Remember the spot that has the neighborhood bully calling Hancock a 'jerk'? Hancock gets up close and says 'Call me a jerk just one more time!', which the child does. Hancock proceeds to throw him high into the air, getting more hang time than Isaiah Ryder ever did. When the boy comes back down, Hancock catches him. Remember that? Guess what! In the movie, it never happened that way. The bully never called Hancock a 'jerk'. He called him the ever-present 'A**H*Le'. They had to reedit the dialogue to make it presentable for TV. In the process, they lied to parents who might have decided not to expose their children to the language HAD THEY KNOWN IT WAS THROUGHOUT THE FILM.Suffice it to say that the film was riddle with this, and even more offensive, language. It ruined this film for me and ensured that I will never show it to my children.",1,7,17,13 August 2008
