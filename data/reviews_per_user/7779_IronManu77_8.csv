Blade Runner 2049," Watch carefully and you will see the true version of history
","This movie is perfect and ranks number 1 in my top 10. It has Egyptian symbolism throughout, and hints at the creation of the slave race. The Wallace building is like a giant pyramid, with Wallace symbolizing the all powerful pharaohs of Egypt, creating his master slave race, only this time the slave race want independence and the ability to procreate, which they seem to have discovered in this movie. The slave race, genetically created and remastered by ancient beings are what we call Jews today (who are in power today). In fact, the leader of the resistance with the missing eye is an actress who is from Israel. Enough said, I think I learned more from this movie than most people put together watching it.Most important observation:Radiation in Las Vegas which looks like Egypt, gives you clues to a historical nuclear war several thousand years ago that resulted in the destruction of powerful ancient civilizations. Evidence of nuclear wars and nuclear physics is written all over in ancient Sanskrit texts. When exploding the first nuclear bomb, Oppenheimer quoted from these ancient Hindu texts saying 'Now I am become death, the destroyer of world.'",10,1,3,1 May 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Hollywood at its best...Thor Ragnarok is a masterpiece!
","New characters in Thor Ragnarok.....Surtur, Rockman, Mik, Hela, Grandmaster, Valkyrie, Skurge.....Personally, this movie has great rewatching value. It is not as serious as the first two Thor movies and so the change of tactics by adding humor is really well refined. We have plenty of blu rays to enjoy at home but this is our go to movie to feel good. My wife, son and myself particularly love all the characters and the story that unfolds in an entertaining manner. The women are very beautiful, especially Hela and Valkyrie. Hela's makeup changes time and again and that is the only drawback, but she makes up for the great character she plays as the Goddess of Death. Loki is at his usual mischievous self but it was good to see Thor and Loki get along and reunite in this third Thor installment. There are plenty of new characters introduced and the technology is amazing and futuristic. The ability to leap from one world to another is incredible and they do it with ease. I highly recommend getting the blu ray version....the sound and picture are fantastic as is the movie.In summary, the main reason why I like this movie is because it shows even the Gods have their share of problems such as jealousy and sibling rivalry. At the end of the day, despite all the fighting and betrayals, brothers will be brothers and must get along. This is a strong message to our mortal world to get along despite all wrong that happens around us. This is an amazing movie about being a hero and overcoming personal strife and helping people in need. That is what heroes do. :)To the actors, developers of the movie and all those who put their hard work into this masterpiece, my heartiest thanks as this is a treasure to keep and cherish forever.",10,3,17,14 January 2019
Lost in Translation," Ranked seven in my top ten movies of all time
","This ranks at number seven on my top ten favorite movies of all time. Why ranked seven on my list? Because seven is not all that bad and I consider it lucky and I like the number seven too. The number one spot belongs to another movie.Anyway I am digressing. I connected with this movie because I have lived in Japan and it feels nostalgic watching this movie. It is also so nice watching a young woman infatuated over a much older man. Both are married to their respective spouses but nevertheless seem drawn to each other, never crossing the boundaries but enjoying each other for the short duration they have during their stay in Japan. The moments they have together here in Japan will remain like a precious rare gemstone with them for the rest of their lives. These two are lost souls that finally met only to drift apart yet again. A sweet movie and the closure towards the end is brilliant. One of Bill Murray's fantastic efforts in the acting industry. A young Scarlett Johanssen looked absolutely stunning with her youth and vitality only to resurface many years later as the Black Widow and make her statement yet again in the Marvel movies.",10,2,8,18 February 2019

Avengers: Endgame," Son born in Iron Man year 2008....this is our inspiration
","Nothing is perfect, this movie is not perfect and yes it could have been better but it is a fitting conclusion to the Avengers saga and sad that we will not be some characters again in their super hero forms. There will be tears in the theaters so get ready. As for analyzing this movie, I recommend getting a PhD if you have to go into minute details. This is a movie and it will have plotholes, so enjoy it for what it is and the effort put into it.I watched this in IMAX yesterday and watching it again in Dolby in a few days with my family. Thank you to all the hard work put into this movie. Thank you Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Doctor Strange, and many more.....my son was born in 2008 and you guys have served as an inspiration for us all. Thank you.",10,22,59,30 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Watched it 3 times already in XD, Dolby and....IMAX!
","This movie is a cash cow for a good reason...it is an exciting first of a two part conclusion to the build up of Marvel super heroes over the past decade, beginning with Iron Man, leading the fight to Thanos's realm. I watched it in Cinemark XD which was a let down, then second time in Dolby AMC and finally in AMC IMAX. The IMAX experience was the best and I can't wait to own an Infinity War bluray to add to my collection. Furthermore, this movie is a great conversation starter with family members and friends to discuss what happens next. The visuals are stunning, the sound is fantastic and the standout characters were Thanos and Thor. This movie is approaching 2 billion dollar mark and hopefully it should reach it, because it is worth your money spent. I highly suggest IMAX, it was awesome. Looking forward to the second part in 2019!",10,3,17,23 May 2018
Black Panther," Overrated, dull and boring. Waste of time.
","This is a movie you will like watching it the first time because everyone else is jumping on the band wagon. Many months later, your subconscious tells you this movie was completely overrated and a complete and utter waste of time. Watch it once, but it lacks the charm of other Marvel movies.",1,255,446,14 January 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Boring and overrated
","Disinformation about Nazis and propaganda movie. Even as entertainment, I did not find this movie funny at all. Like another reviewer mentioned, not enough to make it an emotional experience.",1,6,13,29 March 2020
