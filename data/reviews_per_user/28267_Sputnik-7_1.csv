Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too much like the original
","This movie is near perfect, except for the small fact that nearly all the scenes (and the plot) are too much like Episode IV: A New Hope. Its rescue princess (or Queen in this case) and have Sith Lord strike down old Jedi while apprentice watches. And the award ceromony at the end... Hello where have we seen that before. Of course Episode II & III will probably not be like Episodes V & VI as Anakin will probably marry Padme (which will make her name... Queen Padme Nabeere Amilda Skywalker[and to think that people found Obi-Wan Kenobi hard to say at first]) and then eventually fall into the Dark Side. All in all a very good movie (It has too many Special Effects for its own good) which copies the original (which isn't neccesarily a bad thing as that was an ab-fab movie in it's own rights) but the events in a different order except for the last. You'll love it you have a) never seen the original or b) if you love the original. You won't like it if you hated the original.",10,0,0,23 May 1999
