Blade Runner 2049," Only ok
",I was excited to see this as a huge BR fan but the pacing was slow and not enough immersion in the BR universe. Just a lot of focus on a few bland characters,6,0,3,13 March 2019
Gravity," Sandra Bullock
",This film is great for a film that sticks you in a box with Sandra bullock for most of the duration. It will make you feel everything she endures - both the pain and the relief,8,1,3,13 March 2019
Fight Club," Should have won best film at the Oscars
",One of the best films of its time! Great acting and music. Right combination of humor and story telling. Only gripe was it was probably 20 min too long.,9,0,0,13 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Funny
",This film just gets funnier and funnier. The music and comedic timing are on point. I like adult slapstick superhero films,9,1,2,12 March 2019
Life of Pi," Beautiful
",Not as good as the book but the movie is visually stunning. The acting was well done. The soundtrack was memorable - nice to watch on the big screen,8,0,0,13 March 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great film
",A story about a great and unique individual. My only negative feedback is the ending- which is a point of controversy that I can't go into details without being a spoiler! Credit to the director and cast. Amazing visuals.,8,0,0,13 March 2019
The Revenant," Nothing special
",Di Caprio is a fine actor. He should have got an Oscar long before this film. His performance was forgettable despite long screen time. The journey isn't as exciting as you'd hope.,7,0,0,13 March 2019
Dunkirk," Beautiful and bleak
",The pacing is slow but the pain and sense of abandonment is real. Watch this film!,8,1,3,13 March 2019
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Not as good
",Definitely I share the sentiments by others here. Not as good as the original and certainly not original at all,5,5,11,14 March 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," All style and only mild substance
",I love Tarantino but this franchise was overrated. It was a mediocre gore fest with little storyline. Very stylized violence and the martial arts sequences weren't that impressive.,6,1,5,13 March 2019
The Dark Knight," Loved it!
",Was a bit long winded but definitely kept me in suspense the whole way! Just go to the bathroom beforehand...,8,1,1,27 September 2018
Reservoir Dogs," Gratuitous violence
",This is not Tarantino's finest work. It was heavily violent for the fun of it to make you cringe and squirm and took away from the plot and character development. Wasn't a fan.,5,0,0,13 March 2019
Titanic," Beautiful and tragic
",This film goes down in history as one of the best based on a true historical event. You'll feel the pain of the characters as the ship sinks. It's truly a human tragedy,9,4,5,13 March 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," Ok
",Di caprio as always delivers and this film is no exception but the writing and self indulgence were the minuses here. I liked the soundtrack.,7,0,1,13 March 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," My favorite
",Hardy does a fine and memorable job as the scary and domineering Bane! The music by Zimmer is outstanding. This film is the best of the trilogy in my opinion and a fitting finale,10,0,0,13 March 2019
Blade Runner," Can't beat the classics
",This film is iconic and creates a universe that hasn't been done this well since. The modern sequel doesn't do justice in comparison. Get onto this if you haven't already,9,0,1,13 March 2019
The Matrix," So good.
","This film has the most memorable action sequences of all time. Between the cool special effects and the music, this is an often forgotten classic",9,1,1,13 March 2019
Deadpool," Funny and compelling but could have been better.
",This film is a bit of hit and miss. The opening action sequences make you think it will be another boring action flick with lots of one-sided fights. It then delves into a humorous account of how the protagonist came to be and his mission that follows. It has some laugh out loud moments mixed with some absolutely cringe-worthy moments. It's surprisingly gory and the violence can be cliched. Reynolds does his best with the script put in front of him. Overall a fun watch and recommended if you haven't seen it yet!,7,0,0,14 October 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," Loved it
",There's not much story here but the exciting action sequences and car chases will keep you hooked if the cool costumes and music don't,8,0,2,13 March 2019
