Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but not perfect
","It's quite hard to make a movie that meets the expectations of die-hard fans of Star Wars.  Thinking how good the first Star Wars movie back in 1977, using very limited technical gadgets and computer technology, everybody was expecting a spectacular new movie that'd replace its predecessor. Don't get me wrong, Lucas has done a fine job.  From the very first scene until the end credits perpetual action engulfs the viewer.  All CG characters interacting with actors/actresses are flawless.  Yet, you can not help but feel there's something missing. The Phantom Menace is a good movie.  However, Lucas could have focused a little more on the plot rather than the action.  Comparing TPM to old trilogy, I wish there were more scenes where Darth Maul showed up and said something (Darth Vader was almost always under the spotlight). Shortly, I'd rate this one 7/10.  A feast for eyes and ear but not for mind...",7,0,0,20 May 1999
