Captain Phillips," Magnificently Brilliant Thriller That Will keep you on the edge of your seat
","Based on a true story, this Magnificently Brilliantly orchestrated Thriller by Paul Greengrass will keep you on the edge of your seat!This film ticks every box. Tom Hanks is perfect.He knows what he is doing as an actor portraying a captain who is responsible for other lives. I could not see a better person in this role.The action runs throughout the movie.Not a moment to take a deep breath.Although you know how the movie ends ,just like with Argo or Titanic,you still are awaiting the next move and the next scene.The Somali Pirates (although I have not been 'lucky' to meet any) could not be more closer to reality .Most of them have minimal to none experience in acting,yet they do a magnificent job. Absolutely stunning. Enjoy!",10,14,24,20 November 2013
Deja Vu," Mind Bending Thriller
","Interesting mind bending 'makes you think a bit' plot, with some non disturbing plot holes (see in IMDb). Being a confirmed fan of Denzel Washington, he is as good as he always is.The film is action packed , and flows through its 126 minutes like the Mississippi river, it's main filming location. It's is a nice movie , and interesting in my mind as it had me thinking the whole time ...what if...what if...This film is unique in providing a SCI-FI envelope to what may seem to be a Non SCI-FI movie.The most mind bending scene would be the one where Denzel drives the Hammer through traffic coming his whilst monitoring the perpetrator ,Jim Caviezel,with one eye through the 'time machine' seeing events that occurring in real time 4 days and 6 hours ago, and with his other eye looking at the traffic in real time .Fantastic scene.",8,1,2,28 December 2013
Gravity," The Good: It's only 90 minutes, and the Filming Technique –Otherwise it's a catastrophe
","The Good:It's only 90 minutes,and the Filming Technique .I was about to get out after 60 minutes but as it was raining outside I preferred to stay. The way this film is made is astonishing! Amazing. As it's in 3D you almost feel a part of the team orbiting in space.Though I have not been in space ,the space stations, and all the equipment seem to be realistic. The special effects are spectacular !So everything that has to do with the technology behind this movie is 10/10.HOWEVER: everything with the plot is 'out of this world'.The plot looks like a Swiss cheese full of holes.Sandra Bullock, George Clooney are as good as they are, although George Clooney has a short appearance in the movie, so for most of the movie it's a Sandra Bullock monologue.",2,23,40,13 November 2013
Argo," 1 Word:Brilliant!
","This is a realistically ,brilliantly made spy spook thriller .No unnecessary bits and pieces. A story of heroes told from start to finish in a fluent minute by minute / day by day documentation of events .History is brought to the spectator without any comments ,yet in true pictures with minimum real footage from the events in 1979-1980 .All characters are doing an excellent job. The streets of Tehran look and feel so realistic it give you the creeps. Ben managed magnificently capture and play the dilemmas,and the frustrations of a senior operative planing and executing a 'mission'.This is the first time i saw everyone staying for the Credits,As they say..It does not end till the fat lady sings.Bravo!Bravo!",10,3,7,14 November 2012
Lion," This emotional masterpiece is one of the best movies i have seen in the recent years
","This emotional masterpiece is one of the best movies i have seen in the recent years .Starting with young Saroo -Sunny Pawar who is absolutely magnificent and later with Dev Patel the older Saroo. Emotions run high throughout the movie. The fact you are watching real life events sheds even more emotions to the already emotional drama .Nicole Kidman has a relatively small role here .The real stars are young and older Saroo,that shine bright throughout the whole film.You will remain with some thoughts after the watching this movie.One of the most interesting thoughts of mine where the reasons of the Brierley's for adopting Saroo.Think about it.!",10,0,1,23 March 2017
Now You See Me," Michael Caine and Morgan freeman saved this movie.
","Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman saved this film.Why? because most of the movie is no more than a spectacular magic show in Las Vegas.There is a light plot as well, but nothing seriously intriguing.The plot has it's 90 degree sharp turns,but something was missing.The magic tricks are nice.Try to take part in some card tricks...you will be amazed. So unless Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman would be there ,being marvelous as they can be ,I would not grade this film with more than 3- 4.Mark Ruffalo is giving a convincing performance ,and so are the rest of the Magician crew for that matter.So to sum up:Nice 1.5 hours of Las Vegas style entertainment brought to your local Cinema with some quick unexpected turns in the plot",7,0,2,4 July 2013
Les Misérables," Enjoyed the movie –got frustrated from some vocals
","I am still not sure what score I will give at the end of this review .It's hard to write an objective personal review about this epic magical musical, that I have seen on stage and numerous times on video (10 and 25 years anniversaries). So let's look at this as a plain movie: As a movie its excellent. Great scenery, dresses, environment. Excellent acting and dramatization.Here is the catch. It's not a plain simple drama movie. It's a musical! As a musical I saidhmm in this case: 'Huston we have a problem'. Sounds of Music /My Fair Lady and many more were musicals and movies as well. They were perfect in both versions. One expects the performers to be able to provide an acceptable level of musical performance. As good as Hugh Jackman is as an actor he is not close to be a valued singer or vocal performer that can encapsulate the epic role of Jean Valjean .As an actor yes-he can.as a singer –vocal performer he would be less than 4/10 on the Arik scale. (Where Alfie Boe and Colm Wilkinson represent the 10/10. There are excellent actors that are also great vocal performers. Eddie Redmayne deserves to be nominated as one of them, so do Amanda Seyfried, Aaron Tveit , Samantha Barks . I am struggling with my opinion about Anne Hathaway's vocal capabilities..6-7/10 on the Arik scale. All in all: I saw the movie twice. Enjoyed the movie –got frustrated from the vocals except those mentioned. Hope you will enjoy it more than I did.",7,0,0,28 May 2013
Prometheus," Just about 2 hours of standard SCI FI-but in 3D. that's it.
","Tried to decide if to rate it 3 or 4 out of 10,that should indicate what I think about this film. Having seen other masterpieces of Ridley Scott I expected much more. This movie leaves one with the feeling that it was made just to make a 3D Sci Fi movie that will explain who is the creator of the slimy alien. The set is very Sci Fi Alien like and someone always has an hidden agenda but in fact nothing happens through out the movie. Most people next to me said at the end of the movie same thing.....and???The actors take their role seriously and give a good show. The special effects are professional and one can easily feel it is a work done by Ridley Scott but the question remains: And? What's it all about?a re-cap of the Alien popping out of one's stomach? A woman scientists fighting a slimy 'Thing' ...We seen that all many years ago in the Alien sequence, So what new in Prometheus? Nothing. Nada! The only reason to see the movie is to enjoy some nice 3D effects. Yet that's in fact the only reason. Sorry Mr Scott but you have to come up with some new Ideas.The bottom line: No suspense what so ever. Not even one moment causing the spectator to jump on his seat. Nothing! Just about 2 hours of standard SCI FI-but in 3D. that's it.",3,1,3,9 June 2012
Life," Boring !
","A failed attempt to do an ALIEN remake of some kind.Sorry guys...try harder. Although its a horror sci-fi movie, still I would expect some sort of basic human emotions when the real first ET is found. What happens here is: lets wake it up.Let's raise the temperature from minus 100 to plus 20 in 3 seconds.Give me a break!. You are dealing with an unknown living source and all that separates you from it is a rubber glove?OMG! The the Rory goes to save his friend whilst wearing no protective clouting and the alien creature is loose in the chamber . again..OMG! Then he is using an incinerator inside that chamber throwing flames left right and center....nothing gets damaged..NOTHING. oh com'on.. 40 minutes did it for me.",3,7,15,16 April 2017
Spectre," Well made action movie
","This again is not the conventional Bond movie. it has some personal touch to who and what Bond is .Although I did not really get what it was Bond was looking for , it did not really matter, as a Bond film is a Bond film. It's either bad Good or excellent.This one in my mind was almost excellent.Well done car and helicopter/plane chases.A lot of punching and fist fights, some gadgets and other geek stuff to enjoy with some Daniel Craig humor. Was glad to see Q playing a more active role.All i all the 150 minutes just flew by.The movie started and in 'no' time was finished.That's because its gripping suspense and action .A lot of things are happening.",8,5,13,12 November 2015
The Martian," The RIDLEY SCOTT we used to know is back!
","Dear Mr. RIDLEY SCOTT .I am so happy to say you have recovered from your Prometheus fiasco . I must say the Martian is an interesting movie well done. You could not have a found a more realistic place to film it in.Wadi Rum was a great choice. Matt Damon is giving his best ( as he usually does). The rest of the cast are doing a good job as well, although personally I think that Mr. Sean Bean was a wasted talent in a what may be considered a second level role. He is much much better than that. So Mr Scott, you did a good job keeping the goofs to an incredible minimum almost non existent number. Incorporating so much suspense, fear, thrill, humour all at the same time takes some skills that you Mr. Scott obviously are blessed with ( Bar the Prometheus fiasco ). So thanks for a great motion picture!-- By now you know I hated Prometheus",8,4,63,3 October 2015
