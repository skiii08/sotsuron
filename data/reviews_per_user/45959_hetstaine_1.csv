The Incredible Hulk," Averagely OK ,
","Ed Norton, not bad ..but what is he doing in this type of predictable movie, he has a lot more depth than something so basic. Quick cash ? Liv Tyler..dear lord , she was terrible ..i was embarrassed by the awkwardness and flatness of her 'acting'. There was no magic at all between her and Ed and the attempted lovemaking scene in the hotel was absolutely terrible.All in all another comic adaption that passed the time while i ate a T- bone dinner, until Ed met Liv i was actually starting to enjoy it, it was all downhill after that i felt. The army v Hulk fight scene in the park looked like a big boring set , the two hummers jumping in on cue was just ..meh, i switched off from about that point and pushed bits of steak around my plate while glancing up to see what would blow up next.",Null,0,0,3 December 2012
