Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Genius. Just plain genius.
","Never having seen Cohen, I didn't know quite what I was in for. However, the word 'genius' seems mild. Outrageousness, offensiveness and brilliant sucking-in of 'patsies' are marvellously intertwined to drive home many social truths that I'm sure many Americans find hard to swallow. Canadian viewers who remember Rick Mercer's 'This Hour Has 22 Minutes' scene where deadly-serious Americans in Washington DC offer their welcome to 'King Sven and Queen Svetlana of Canada' through his CBC 'news crew' will find this expose of their rather frightening neighbours to the south most delicious, despite the extremes to which Borat, um, Cohen, takes the humor. It's Michael Moore on steroids. Well, and probably more than a little Viagra... I wanted to buy another ticket and go right back in.",10,2,12,25 November 2006
