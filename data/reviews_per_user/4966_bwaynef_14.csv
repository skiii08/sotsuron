The Rock," Has Roll
","'The Rock' doesn't strive to be a dramatic powerhouse, but it's a lot of fun thanks to the cast.  Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage are an inspired team; the former is the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz, and Cage is a terrorism expert who needs him to assist in an invasion of the legendary prison which is being held hostage by a deranged General, angered at the mistreatment his men received from the Pentagon.  It's all highly charged action movie nonsense, but Connery and Cage elevate this cinematic amusement park into a nifty, if modest, acting showcase.",Null,1,1,26 March 1999
As Good as It Gets," Not as good as it gets, but certainly good
","I didn't expect 'As Good As It Gets' to live up to its title, and it doesn't.  The big-screen work of writer-director James L. Brooks, including the Oscar winning 'Terms of Endearment,' has yet to match the quality of TV's 'Mary Tyler Moore Show,' which he guided to classic status in the 70s. Nonetheless, 'As Good As It Gets' is his best work for the big screen to date.  Jack Nicholson did not deserve his third Oscar for his role here, but, hey, he's Jack and a delight to watch even though his affliction--obsessive compulsive disorder--isn't rendered too believably (Nicholson doesn't simply avoid stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk, he rather nonchalantly DANCES around them--hardly the thing a true obsessive compulsive would do).  Helen Hunt's no-nonsense waitress is convincing, though, as is Greg Kinnear's gay artist.  There are more than enough funny lines to merit the Oscar nomination for best screenplay, and even at 144 minutes (what is this?  A James Bond movie?), it's an enjoyable ride.",7,1,3,3 April 1999
Amistad," The real mutiny occurs behind the camera
","When Steven Spielberg's 'Amistad' opened at the end of 1997, most critics were respectful but unenthused.  The respect was likely inspired by the subject matter--an obscure historical event in which Africans on their way to slavery in America stage a mutiny, ultimately standing trial for their actions--while the lack of enthusiasm had to do with Spielberg's pedestrian handling of the story.  I suspect the world's most popular filmmaker of performing some politically correct social service activity with this film. It began, after all, as a pet project of dancer/choreographer Debbie Allen. Perhaps eager to get on to his own project, 'Saving Private Ryan,' Spielberg did not give 'Amistad' his all, believing the subject matter itself would carry the day.  The PC aspect of the film is evident in the casting of Morgan Freeman, one of our greatest actors, who is given top billing for a role that requires him to do nothing but stand around looking concerned and barely uttering a word.  Forgive me my cynicism, but I suspect Mr. Freeman is present only because he is black, whereas Mr. Spielberg is white and in need of credibility with those who, like Spike Lee, think only blacks are qualified to make films on African-American themes. Lee was critical of 'Amistad,' and of its emphasis on the white characters, most notably Matthew McConaughey who really has no place in this film.Of course, the film's big problem is that it is dull, dull, dull, while John Williams' celebratory music score is out of synch with such a downbeat effort.  Sure, the mutineers are found not guilty and permitted to return to their homeland, but slavery continues on in the colonies.Among the actors, only Anthony Hopkins is given the chance to distinguish himself with a notable performance, but even he falls short of his usual standards.  He lets the makeup and his accent do the work for him. The real mutiny in 'Amistad' occurs behind the camera.  A lame script and uninspired direction let the drama dissipate before our eyes.",5,8,13,3 April 1999
A Bridge Too Far," Sprawling and shapeless
","'A Bridge Too Far' is a sprawling, shapeless epic with Ryan O' Neal looking desperately out of place as a General.  O' Neal, then in his late 30s but looking 10 years younger, plays the same person inhabited by then 51 or 52 year-old Robert Ryan in 1962's 'The Longest Day.'  The perpetually boyish O' Neal looks like he would be perfectly cast as Jimmy Olson in a Superman movie, not as a WWII General.  The film as a whole is a wearisome affair, just as the majority of critics claimed when it opened in June 1977, the summer of 'Star Wars.'  Perhaps 'Star Wars' would have been a better title for this film since it is, in the tradition of 'The Longest Day,' stuffed with the species.But few of these 'stars' have enough screen time to distinguish themselves. Chomping on a big fat cigar, Elliott Gould is a mere caricature of dozens of other dogfaces in dozens of other WWII movies.  As already noted, Ryan O' Neal, who probably has the most screen time of the American actors, is miscast, much too boyish to be believable as a General.  Robert Redford, perhaps the biggest marquee name at the time of the film's release, gets the star treatment, being introduced (in the last 45 minutes or so) with a closeup that seems to cry out, 'Hey kids, look who's here!'  Redford is there all right, but I found myself wishing that Richard Attenborough were not.  The actor turned director who, five years later, would lead 'Gandhi' to an eight Oscar sweep, is out of his element in such a huge production. The intimacy of 1993's superb 'Shadowlands' is more his style.  'A Bridge Too Far' never gains momentum, and John Addison's wimpy music score doesn't help at all.",Null,0,1,18 April 1999
Crash," The worst Oscar winning best picture. EVER!
","Very simply, 'Crash' is the worst film to win the Oscar for best picture. Ever! 'Crash' may even be the worst film to be nominated for Hollywood's highest honor. Condescending, contrived, and trite, this is the work of hacks. The screenplay violates one of the simplest but most important rules of writing in ways even a C student in screen writing would be unlikely to do. Ever heard the command to SHOW, NOT TELL? Since neither Paul Haggis nor his co-conspirators have the talent to show the effects of racism on individuals and society, they tell. And tell. And tell. The actors might as well be reciting a newspaper column, one written way back in the 60s, a decade when this pretentious, self important piece of tripe might have managed to fool even the wisest among us that it had some relevance. Then again, the 60s was the decade of 'In the Heat of the Night,' not to mention the more obscure 'Pressure Point,' both of which looked at race relations with unblinking honesty and a knowledge of how people really act, think, and talk. The characters in 'Crash' are laughable stereotypes who rarely utter one word that sounds like something that would emerge from the mouth of a real human being.Not since 'Doctor Doolittle' scored an Oscar nomination for best picture in 1967 (depriving 'In Cold Blood,' 'Cool Hand Luke,' and several other better films of that honor) has Oscar made a blunder as bad as giving his top prize to this dim-witted dud.",2,18,28,23 March 2006
Forrest Gump," Tom Hanks makes it work
","Some of its critics say that 'Forrest Gump' is little more than a right wing fable whose message is 'Vote Republican.'  Yes, Forrest is the embodiment of 'traditional values,' a simpleton who worships God, honors his mother, does what he's told, and never asks questions.  Good old Forrest succeeds in life by embracing the values of mainstream society while  Jenny, the girl he loves with a blind passion, pursues the fancy-free lifestyles in vogue at each time period portrayed:  In the 1960s, she joins the counterculture, strumming a guitar, smoking dope, dropping acid, and protesting the war in Vietnam in which Forrest courageously fights.  In the 70s, while Forrest is a successful businessman, Jenny is a fast living, sexually promiscuous member of the disco set.Forrest represents America, or, rather, the America that right wing propagandists want everyone to believe is the true America.  Do what you're told, never talk back, and you'll be successful and happy.  Jenny, on the other hand, epitomizes rebellion and the rejection of the unthinking way of life that the government would prefer we pursue.  Forrest is good.  Jenny is bad.  Forrest further strengthens his image of goodness by always, always, ALWAYS taking Jenny back whenever her latest flirtations fail to fulfill her.  Like Jesus, Forrest loves Jenny unconditionally, never questioning her lack of faithfulness.  Yes, this film says, America forgives all of you long-haired, dope smoking, draft-dodging sex perverts, or we will if you agree to shape up, and fast.  For Jenny, however, it was too late.  Once she settled down into a respectable middle-class life, her past caught up with her.Of course, some people see the above interpretation  as hogwash.  They maintain that 'Forrest Gump' is simply a fable promoting such tried and true values as honoring your parents and your God.  It's the story of innocence uncorrupted by a greedy, frequently hateful and dishonest world.  No matter how evil the times, goodness can prevail.I must say I can relate to the criticisms; they have validity. But so do the arguments of those who champion the film.  It is with the latter group that I side, and Tom Hanks, more than anything else, is the reason.  Not since James Stewart has an actor so believably portrayed kindness and decency. Hanks makes this film work, and his performance can even help you overlook the often awkward special-effects (the scene in which Forrest appears on 'The Dick Cavett Show' with John Lennon failed to convince).  I think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar that year for 'The Shawshank Redemption,' but of all the people who took home Oscars for 'Forrest Gump,' no one earned theirs more than Hanks.  I can't imagine another actor (a living one, anyway) taking on this character and pulling it off as splendidly as he did.",Null,0,2,18 April 1999
Léon: The Professional," A violent, sexy version of a Shirley Temple movie
","Even though Gary Oldman's portrayal of a pill popping, homicidal Drug Enforcement Agent followed his title role in 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' by two years, the fine British actor doesn't appear to have gotten the Count from Transylvania out of his system.  While biting down on the capsules he pops into his mouth prior to executing his victims, Oldman shivers, shakes, crosses his eyes, and shrieks in ways similar to a vampire preparing to sink his fangs into a jugular vein.  It's an entertaining comic book performance that is perfectly in synch with a story that, no matter how grim and violent, is essentially a fantasy, one as syrupy and sentimental as an old Shirley Temple movie.",7,1,5,29 March 1999
North by Northwest," Hitchcock's 'blue' movie
","Picasso had his 'blue' period, and blue figured prominently in some of Elvis Presley's recordings ('Blue Moon,' 'Blue Moon of Kentucky,' 'A Mess of Blues,' 'Moody Blue,' and so on).  But I don't recall hearing much about Alfred Hitchcock's blue period.  Yet, the great director's 'North by Northwest' is awash in that color, so much so that it must have been a deliberate, and, therefore, significant move.Blue, and a rather unattractive pale shade of it at that, is everywhere in 'North by Northwest,' so damn prominent that I found myself annoyed when watching what was once one of my favorite films on video.  Yes, there was so much blue that 'North by Northwest' may not be one of my favorite films for long.  Blue, especially that pale shade, is not my favorite color.  But there's Cary Grant in a pale blue suit; the interior of the train he boards when fleeing the police is blue; the sky, of course, is blue; and, well, there just seems to be blue--that sickening pale blue--everywhere.  What was Hitchcock thinking?  The master of suspense was famous for planning his films down to the smallest detail, so unless I saw a bad video transfer, he must have had a reason for emphasizing that color.Well, 'North by Northwest' is still one of Hitchcock's greatest films, although what stands out after repeated viewings is not that crop duster scene, or the escape from enemy agents across the faces of Mount Rushmore, or the naughty image at the conclusion, but the music:  Bernard Herrmann's score is one of the composer's most thrilling and unforgettable works.I must say that after my most recent encounter with the blue hues of 'North by Northwest,' I appreciate all the more the fact that Hitchcock made his next film ('Psycho,' of course) in black-and-white.",10,1,1,7 April 1999
Apocalypse Now," A wandering elephant
","'My movie is not ABOUT Vietnam,' Francis Ford Coppola said at a press conference during the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.  'It IS Vietnam.'  The men who actually fought that never officially declared war may disagree that 'Apocalypse Now,' the movie is question, is what its director claimed, but there are similarities.  Like Vietnam, this film is long, pointless and costly.  It opens impressively, if pretentiously, with Lt. Willard, the almost ghostly protagonist, sprawled across a bed in a Saigon hotel room, mumbling through a voiceover reminiscent of a 1940s private eye movie, while helicopters are superimposed over his sweat-beaded face.  Before the scene concludes, Willard (Martin Sheen), seemingly suffers a nervous breakdown, smashing his hand through a mirror, then sinking to the floor, sobbing as The Doors perform 'The End' on the soundtrack.  This surreal moment soon gives way to a scene that could have been lifted from a dozen James Bond movies:  Willard is ordered to track down and kill Colonel Kurtz, a mysterious figure who has established a military outpost that acknowledges no rule but his own.  What follows are some spectacular battle scenes, some good acting (Robert Duvall), some bad acting (Frederic Forrest), and some acting leftover from 'Easy Rider' ten years earlier (Dennis Hopper), all of it as disconnected as the war itself.  When Willard finally confronts Colonel Kurtz, we find Marlon Brando, his head shaved and his enormous bulk swamped in shadows, lethargically mumbling incoherent dialogue that, instead of tying up loose ends, leaves them dangling as precariously than ever. The final moments are so darkly lit, it's debatable whether Willard carries out his mission or not. Peopled by actors who made their name in films with which Coppola was associated (Duvall, Forrest, Harrison Ford), or found renewed popularity under his direction (Brando), this is the biggest home movie ever made. It is essentially a vanity production fueled by the director's enormous ego. Who else but an egomaniac would make a comment like the one Coppola made at Cannes?  The true star of 'Apocalypse Now,' however, is not Coppola or Brando, but Vittorio Storaro whose cinematography almost makes this wandering elephant worthwhile.",Null,1,2,27 March 1999
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Faithful and engrossing remake of Swedish original
","If you saw and liked the original Swedish film based on Stieg Larsson's novel 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,' you might be pleased or disappointed with David Fincher's English-language remake for the same reason: this is a pretty straight-forward remake with few surprises for fans of Neil Arden Opley's 2009 adaptation of the same material. Even the leading players, Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, seem to have been chosen because of their resemblance to Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.Despite its familiarity, I found this version as engrossing as the first with the cast more than equal to the challenge of bringing these characters to life. And if you're looking for a great insult to direct at an enemy, the phrase on Mara's T-shirt in one scene is a masterpiece of raunchy perfection. I think Leo the Lion, M-G-M's mascot, may have read it, too, which could explain why his roar was silent for a change when the company logo appeared on screen before the movie.Be sure not to miss the opening titles which reminded me of the opening of a Bond film as it might appear in a nightmare.",9,4,9,22 December 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," Great, but could have been greater
","'Ben-Hur' won more Oscars, 'Spartacus' had a more accessible cast, but 'Lawrence of Arabia,' David Lean's 1962 biography of the enigmatic British officer known as much for his flamboyance as he was for his bravery, is regarded by most critics and film historians as the greatest of all epics. Originally 222 minutes long, then cut and recut for various re-issues, the winner of 7 Academy Awards was restored to a nearly intact running time of 216 minutes and re-released to great acclaim in 1989.  What makes 'Lawrence' so special?  The general consensus seems to be that the film is 'literate,' while so many of these big scale epics are not.  True enough, but it seems to me that 'literate' is often a euphemism for 'dull.''Lawrence' does make good use of its 3 hours and 36 minutes, so it isn't dull, but I am at a loss to find one truly exciting moment.  Even the battle scenes are subdued, and nothing really stirred my emotions the way 'Spartacus' managed to do. What is fascinating, however, is the portrait--fairly ambiguous--drawn by Peter O' Toole, who achieved international stardom as a result of this role.  His Lawrence is somewhat ethereal, yet brave and compassionate. The alleged homosexuality of the real Lawrence--a taboo for on-screen exploration back in 1962--seems to be suggested by O' Toole's occasionally fey manner and by some of the dialogue in the script.  'I'm not an ordinary man,' Lawrence tells one of his superiors in the British service.  The man's reaction is enlightening:  'I'm not talking about THAT!' he says.Otherwise, 'Lawrence' features the usual roundup of British actors one usually finds in these things (Alec Guiness, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quayle, et al), and Arthur Kennedy, basically reviving the newspaperman role he essayed two years earlier in 'Elmer Gantry.'  Does it sound like I'm panning Mr. Lean's epic film?  I hope not.  'Lawrence of Arabia' IS a great film, but it would have been greater if it had worked on the emotions as well as it does on the intellect.",9,2,7,4 April 1999
The Piano," Strikes a wrong chord
","Years ago, when foreign 'art' films by the likes of Federico Fellini were all the rage, attracting attention even among the general populace, Mad magazine parodied these often difficult to comprehend films, suggesting that the more obscure the plot and the more ambiguous the actions of the characters, the more lavish the critics would be in their praise.  Alfred E. Newman and company also provided tips for their readers who wanted to make their own art film, something that was possible because, at the time, the more amateurish the production, the more authentic it was thought to be. There is nothing amateurish about 'The Piano,' Jane Campion's film that, if not for 'Schindler's List' would likely have won the 1993 Best Picture Oscar, and some might argue that it is not foreign since the characters speak English, but otherwise it meets all the requirements set down by Mad magazine for an 'art' film:  It is obscure, ambiguous, and just plain stupid.The piano of the title is, I reckon, meant to be symbolic, but what does it symbolize?  The sexuality of the lead character, Ada?  Ada is a mute married to a man whose neighbor also has designs on her, but no matter how strong the passion both men feel, Ada's only satisfaction comes through playing that piano.  Her playing would seem to represent masturbation.  Men, of course, are brutes only interested in their own pleasure.  They don't make love.  They only have sex.  If Ada is to experience orgasm, she will, as dozens of women's magazines and TV talk shows will tell you, have to do it herself.Set in an ill-defined period that resembles the 19th century (at least the way it is usually depicted on film), the movie's costumes, cinematography, and set designs are very pleasing to the eye, as is Holly Hunter as Ada and Anna Pacquin as her daughter.  Though neither performance was deserving of an Oscar, both are quite good considering the foolishness of the script. Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill as Ada's lovers are okay, too.  Still, like those 'art' films parodied in Mad magazine, 'The Piano' is simply nonsense--a 'woman's film' (egad!) that bashes men as forcefully as Ada hits those keys.  It is as fashionable as 'political correctness,' just as silly, and just as likely to be laughed at in years to come.",Null,4,8,5 April 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," What's not to like?
","Because of the accents (Romanian? German? Transylvanian?), much of the dialogue was unintelligible, and because of director Coppola's preoccupation with set designs, special-effects, makeup, and stylish camera work, the story was occasionally left behind like a spare tire, but this 'Dracula' was pretty darned terrific, anyway.  What's not to like about a movie that casts oddball crooner Tom Waits as the fly and spider eating Renfield, a role very memorably played by the tragic Dwight Frye in the 1931 Lugosi version? Then you've got the great Anthony Hopkins on hand as an eccentric and uncouth Professor Van Helsing, and Gary Oldman as the Count of the title. Visually, the film is masterful, sumptuously photographed and stuffed from end to end with fascinating and provocative imagery, the highlights being at Dracula's castle where the old Count, his hair in a bun, slithers about, casting shadows that are never in synch with his movements, and licking the blood off his houseguest's razor.  Like Tod Browning's 1931 classic, this one's best moments are at the beginning, but unlike that Bela Lugosi starrer, this one will keep you awake.",Null,0,1,1 April 1999
Apollo 13," A good film, but the music sounds awfully familiar
","Nominated for 9 Academy Awards (but not best director), 'Apollo 13' is a little sterile, filled with techno-speak that sometimes makes the action difficult to follow, but, overall, it is a good film, very deserving of its Oscar nomination for best picture.  Tom Hanks, sacrificing the spotlight to do ensemble duty with Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon, is terrific, of course, completely natural as astronaut Jim Lovett, and, as always, eminently likeable.  The entire cast is equally fine.  James Horner's Oscar nominated score, however, should have been disqualified on the grounds that it sounds suspiciously like the melody of Art Garfunkel's 1973 hit, 'All I Know.' Am I the only one who noticed that?",Null,0,0,28 March 1999
