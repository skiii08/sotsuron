Ghost," Loved it....
",I loved this movie. It was very touching and nothing was wrong with it. Great performance by Whoopi...she was hilarious and kept the movie going along even better. I liked the part when Oda didn't want to give the money to the nuns. Overall a tearjerker it was so sad at the end. ***1/2 out of ****,10,6,8,14 September 2003
Citizen Kane," I actually liked it...
","I remember coming home from school and they were going to do Citizen Kane so I decided to watch it. I asked my dad about it and he said it was boring, but I watched it anyway. What a great movie! I was very impressed by the mystery and trying to guess what Rosebud was. It was very good, but I didn't understand why his last words would be Rosebud...(SPOILER AHEAD)which was his sled. But it was very good and it should've won Best Picture. ***1/2 out of 4",8,1,4,11 September 2003
The Bourne Identity," It was ok
","I am not a big fan of action/adventure films, but this film had a good plot and everything was quite perfect. But some parts were boring and was dragging a little. My favorite character is probably Marie played by Potente because she helped Bourne a lot and stayed with him and supported him. I liked that there was a little romance in it too. I would see the sequel when it comes out. *** out of ****",7,0,1,12 September 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beautiful...Cinematography that is
","I remember seeing Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring in theaters. It was a long, tired, kinda fun experience. I have to admit it had the most beautiful scenery and cinematography I have ever seen. It also had a beautiful score. It is a beautiful film....but to be academy award nominated for Best Picture??? Did it have great acting? There's hardly any talking. Just mainly action and fighting. None of the actors are not even nominated for acting...but they should've nominated Ian. I think he probably did the Best Acting in the whole entire film. Yes, it deserved to be nominated for best song, best cinematography, best costume, and so on...I wouldn't even watch it again. I really don't have anytime. It's 3 hours long. I have seen my fair share of long films. This movie has a very big following of people. I really respect them actually. They respect the film for many reasons. My friend likes it for the actors in the film. I just love the cinematography it's gorgeous. I finally give this film ***",Null,0,1,8 December 2003
A Clockwork Orange," Where do I begin...
","The first time I saw this film I was so nervous to see it because everyone said it was disturbing, but I went along with it and whoa what a ride! I was terrified at the imagery and the music and the characters. I liked this movie a lot, but I warn that people with weak stomach's might get sick even I got sick the next day. I was all shaky and stuff, but it was a wonderful film. My favorite parts are when Alex is in the record store and the part when Alex gets committed in jail its really funny. **** out of ****",10,0,0,12 September 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Wonderful
","What a beautiful movie. The acting was wonderful everything was wonderful. I always agreed with Nicholson's character he was right about everything. I also liked the plot outline...that the nurse is more dangerous than the patients. Nurse Ratched was probably trying to do the best of the patients, but she was only making it worse. This is one of my favorite movies. It was very deep and moving. SPOILER AHEAD: I didn't understand why Chief killed McMurphy, but then I realized that he didn't want McMurphy to suffer any longer and when Chief left the ward happily I felt happy also. **** out of ****",10,1,2,14 September 2003
The Iron Giant," Great
","The story is about a young boy named Hogarth who lives in 1950's Maine with his mother. He happens to go out one night and he finds an iron giant..hence the title. He first is very scared, but then he realizes the giant has a good heart. So then Hogarth befriends Dean who likes to make art out of metal. Hogarth hides the giant at Dean's house when Hogarth finds out that Mr. Kent Mansley who works for the government wants to destroy the giant because they feel that some country sent him to destroy the world. The Iron Giant likes to eat metal so where they put him was a perfect place for him to hide. Other problems occur between Hogarth and Mr. Mansley because they go through great lengths to kill him. What I thought of this film was that it was very beautiful. I had a tear in my eye when The Iron Giant saw the deer that died and the giant had feelings for it. I also was sad when the giant thought Hogarth was dead. I felt what the giant was going through. I liked the character of the iron giant because he risked his life to help Hogarth because he really loved him. The ending was also very sad because (BIG SPOILERS!!!!) The Iron Giant killed himself. ***1/2",10,1,2,29 November 2003
