Vertigo," What a stupid, overrated movie!
","HOW is this on the top 250 films list??? Sitting through this thing was just awful, it was worse than physical pain! The...most...boring...movie...ever...made! Trust me, I have seen my share of hokey, boring films, but if this film went any slower I swear you'd see the frames. The fact that this is liked by so many people is a travesty. I only rented it (thanks a lot, guys) and I feel like I blew my money, and it was only $3.00. WHAT was this film trying to do!? How could this even have been made?! I'm surprised anyone was left in the theater when the credits began to roll. I'm serious, anyone who has not seen this, avoid it like a serial killer. A guy is hired to follow his friend's wife around because she is possessed and possibly suicidal. They manage to fall in love in an unbelieveable and cheesy way. Then she goes and dies and he meets a woman who reminds him so much of her that he even begins to dress her like his lost love. Oh yeah, and this is spread out over like 2 hours. It feels like 5. I was bored to death while the cheesy soap opera music soared when he kissed her in their stupid love affair. The ending is very dumb, I was hoping for some gratification after having sat through the most God awful dull film ever, but no. It ends badly and that's it. Blah. How anyone could enjoy such an uninteresting film is beyond me. We see movies to be entertained. This is not anything near entertainment. It provides nothing to the viewer except a slow, deathly drag scene after scene. Entertainment at it's worst. The most unenjoyable film ever. In the end, just another seriously overrated film that anyone normal would fall asleep watching and laugh at later.",Null,6,19,29 January 2003
Se7en," A nasty piece of (good) film-making.
","I have heard people comment on the sickness of this movie, calling it twisted and depraved. Well, it is. But these are only taken as compliments to the makers of this dark film. All the times while watching it that you keep telling yourself to turn it off, to get rid of this corrupt piece of trash, you are behaving exactly the way the people involved in making the movie wanted you to behave. You're supposed to envision the world and the people in it as pure Hell. Never in a film has urban life been so nightmarishly portrayed. From the dark and rainy days, to the smog and people-infested streets, down to the sick mind of the killer and the victims of society he preys on, this film sends a message out about what we value in life. Are we really happy living in a world such as this? This movie is very dark, and often depressing when it's not bordering on pure sickness. The murders here are so evil and unspeakable it's hard to imagine a human capable of doing such a thing. At times, I was appalled. Many will find this one hard to watch. In fact, if you don't, you may have more problems than the killer. But instead of being put off by it's violence and stunned by the things it dares to show us, embrace what the film is trying to say. No, it's not just showing you these twisted things for the Hell of it. It's trying to make you open your eyes and take in what's around you. This movie will force you to really take a good look at the world today, and scaring you into it is the best way possible. What's more frightening: sitting through the movie, or going out into the world when it's over? You decide. I recommend anyone that has a serious mind and likes intelligent, well-made movies that deliver more than the usual bag of tricks to see this, if you can stomach it. Next to Silence of the Lambs, it is the best crime thriller ever made.",Null,0,0,22 July 2002
Memento," A very different, very good movie experience.
","I can't say this was a fun film to watch, for the most part I was too busy getting frustrated trying to make sense of it all. Really, it makes you mad. But it deserves a lot of credit because it is very creative and ambitious, and overall a great film. It was only after the film was over that I realized I had just seen a great movie. Some advice: don't rent this movie and just expect to sit back and watch it with some popcorn and some buddies. This film requires an enormous amount of participation from the viewer. There are facts to remember, people, places, events, etc. And to make it even worse, the movie plays backwards, in intervals. Don't let any of this scare you. See this movie, the agony of trying to piece the thing together is worth it. Very different, very good, definitely worth seeing. If you can handle it.",Null,1,2,27 July 2002
Final Destination 2," Cheesy trash movie.
","Final Destination didn't need a sequel in the first place, but I guess all those gore-hungry teens and their wallets were too much to pass by. If you've seen Final Destination then you've seen part two already, they are exactly the same. Kimberly is on a road trip with her friends, foresees their deaths and many others' in a huge traffic accident, wakes from the premonition, saves several people from getting on the freeway, the survivors start to die...wow, how original, add in a plane and you've got the first movie again! Magic! The script is Final Destination with new characters and new deaths. The dialogue is very corny, I felt embarrassed to be watching a movie where every character goes 'What are you talking about?' or 'What's going on?' every other minute, as if that line hasn't been used in horror movies over and over to the point it's a cliche in itself. Plus, it just adds to the bad acting. The girl playing Kimberly is serviceable and of course Ali Larter is fine, but the other 'actors' must have done this between their commercial shoots. It's bad. The body count is the only thing the movie is concerned with, and that's no surprise. Everything just leads up to another deathtrap in which someone dies in a horribly gory way. If you don't like blood, stay away. Really there's nothing much to look forward to except to see who's going to bite it and how. There's some bogus subplot about how only new life can defeat death, but it's very cheesy and uninteresting, just like the movie. The opening car pileup is neatly choreographed but brought down by the bad acting and amateur music, which should have been more impactful. Ali Larter should have stayed away just like Devon Sawa and made a real movie where she gets better lines and a chance to show she has talent. Her lines are bad, just like everyone elses'. The movie takes itself way too seriously at parts that it's embarrassing how corny it all is.The first film was no masterpiece, but it was a serviceable thriller with a fine cast. There is no one in this sequel with a bit of acting talent observed from the first cast. I'm sure this movie will be an embarrassment to Kerr Smith, Devon Sawa, and surely Ali Larter since all it does is give the first one a bad name. Yep, they've turned Final Destination into a franchise. This one is not even half as good as the first and the direction, music, and acting minus Larter is rock bottom. If you like gore and no more, treat yourself. Otherwise, the creepiness and deft craft of the first film is absent and cheesiness takes over. Stay away if you can help it, death should have taken this film.",Null,0,0,31 January 2003
American Psycho," I'm sorry, what were you saying?
","I watched this film the first time, on video, without reading any reviews on it whatsoever spare an article in 'Entertainment Weekly' which gave it an 'A'. While some parts of it were fairly good, most of it was either somewhat boring or really, really boring. By the time the end rolled around, I was thankful that I could stand up, walk around, exercise my legs, and return this to Blockbuster. It was confusing, weird, and I couldn't see anything beyond that because I was so bored watching it. Then I read the reviews on it. To my utter surprise, everyone liked it, like a lot. Compliments were given to the writing, directing, themes, and plot. So I thought I had overlooked something. I rented it again. Nope. It was no more entertaining, no less boring, and no more good, period. So all of this was supposed to be in Bateman's head? Where did that come from? Call me stupid, but I really don't like movies that make you think beyond the point of interpreting the entire ending more than once. The only good parts in the movie WERE the parts where Bateman was killing people, then I learn it's all supposed to be imagined? Wow, that's entertainment!? A lot of references are made to the '80s culture and materialism, which serves as sort of a satire/joke, but let's face it, do we care? The attempt to manifest something in the movie that you can't see on screen is a good attempt by the director. In fact, it might have even worked if the movie had not been such a terrible bore. It's supposed to be understood that Bateman is what all of us are inside. You can take that trip into the dark recesses of the human mind if you want to, but do you have a high tolerance for confusing stories, slow pacing, and one too many inside jokes dealing with the yuppie culture? I appreciate what the film tried to do, and it is very technically well made. The camera movement and angles are very good, the acting is excellent, and the weird style it has is pulled off well, it remains weird without getting too serious. However, I can't sit on my butt for two hours watching something like this without getting up out of my chair every five minutes. Now if there were a few more murders, maybe a little more suspense, and more logic added into this, then I guess I could manage. Otherwise, I'll spend the time I use to sit on my butt watching something else. At least I tried.",Null,0,0,6 June 2002
American Psycho," Just watch it.
","Believe me when I say that trying to read too much into this film is worthless and drives you insane. There are too many comments by people who think they understand it, and those who don't. Yet no one is right. Those who 'understood' it say Patrick Bateman, the main character the film is based on, is just thinking he kills people and never actually does. Well then how come the sequel due for release this spring is about a Patrick Bateman SURVIVOR? If it was all in the guy's head, it's hard to believe he has survivors if no one was hurt, right? So the sequel proves that wrong. And when you look too hard you miss the entire point anyways. Just watch the movie and chances are you'll find something you like about it and develop your own perspective, because everyone sees it a different way. All in all a great film, can't wait for the sequel and to see these smart people who 'get' it explain why it has a survivor of Bateman. Maybe it's all in her head too, huh?",Null,0,0,22 February 2002
The Shining," Artsy horror...nothing more.
","Don't be fooled that just because this a Stanley Kubrick movie and it's on the top 250 films here that it's good. Don't get me wrong, the movie is certainly top-notch horror, but only in the terms that it's not a teenage slasher, the body count is not sky high, it has people who can actually act, and the mood is just right. For a horror film, that's VERY rare. BUT...you will most likely fall asleep waiting for the movie to get to a scare. Kubrick lets this movie drag on forever...it's exhausting. If you've read the book, you know it's about a family that moves into the Overlook Hotel where the dad pulls a crazy and goes postal with an axe (actually, a mallet in the book). Sound interesting? It is. If you can wait the 2 hours to get to that part. The only good thing about this is the end, which is terrifying and definitely a horror classic, and the several good scares Kubrick inserts...between all the boring stuff. This 'family' just walks around the hotel alone, not even talking to one another except about meals, etc. while Nicholson (a great performance, by the way) loses it for no apparent reason...a little explanation would have helped. Shelly Duvall is a good actress...her character is such a wuss you could hit her with a feather and she would die. Overall this movie has serious flaws like slow pacing...um, VERY slow...and the biggest flaw of all is in the characters. I never even FEEL the connection between these people. You never believe they are a family. I mean, the little boy Danny is being chased by his own FATHER with an axe...that's something absolutely terrible...but in this movie you never even see the two as father and son...you see them as killer and prey. Hello?! They are blood relatives, shouldn't we feel that? This is NOT a family. This movie is just artsy, dressed up horror, boil it all down and you got a boring movie with a few good scares. If you want to see this, make sure you see it alone. That way you won't make your friends sit for over 2 hours watching Danny ride around on a bike, Wendy make meals, and Jack type.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terrific fun.
","James Cameron is one of the greatest crowd pleasers of all time. Nothing he does falls short of entertaining the audience. If you're looking for a romping good time with laughs and thrills, then this movie is for you. Great action, special effects, and acting make this movie have that blockbuster feel.

2001: A Space Odyssey," Horrible.
","This movie is so bad, I can't even find a word in the dictionary to describe it. Why on earth would anyone want to see this? Stanley Kubrick has got to be the most overrated director in the history of cinema. I don't think there's ever been a director who's made so many bad movies and is hailed as a God. The whole movie is pictures and music, or what some of you would call 'art.' There's like maybe a half hour of talking in a movie that's over two hours. So much time is spent on the 'art' of this movie that it doesn't even feel like a movie. God, you go to the museum to see art, you go to the movies to have a good time. I cannot even describe the agony of watching this film. In fact, it was so bad I had to get up every other minute and walk around. You will never in your life see such a boring picture. This is THE most boring and overrated movie of ALL TIME. How does Kubrick do it? It seems that all he has to do is make a movie that no one understands and everyone goes nuts over it! I could have shown scenes of space and men in space and mammals beating each other with bones and would it be called one of the best films of all time? I even tried using my imagination to 'look' for something in the movie that I thought I wasn't getting but I couldn't even get over the fact that I was still watching it. Is this even classified as a movie, or is it a space slide show? Yes, it's beautiful, but I wanted to see a freaking film. Don't recommend this to friends. They'll shoot you. Kubrick once again steals the show with a real dud. Psychologists should show this film to people as part of an experiment on boredom. You'll wanna ship this movie off into space, or at least go to space yourself to get away from it. Ignore all the hype, this movie is a waste of your time. It's NOT entertainment. Kubrick needed to realize why people go to the movies. This is possibly one of the worst films ever, and it's praised as a masterpiece! Ahh!",Null,5,12,21 June 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," I don't know why, but I liked it.
","I only rented this because everyone says what a God Kubrick is, and I had to check it out. Most people I knew hated it. They said it was nothing but an endless charade of nudity and dullness. While I do agree that it has those things, I did like it. I can't explain it. I was actually impressed with myself that I, as a teenager, was able to appreciate the film. Does that mean I am a serious moviegoer? I'm not sure. But I can say that all the people who hated it are probably those who have become adjusted to non-stop action, special effects, and explosions, a hint at why Steven Spielberg is more popular with the people. It takes a lot of guts these days to make a film like this. People are used to something happening right away, they have forgotten how to watch movies and read into them. I didn't understand this movie, I'm not sure I ever will. I didn't watch it to see Kidman naked, either. I'm sure Kubrick made this for some reason, however, it is lost to me. This is one of those movies where you just know they are trying to tell you something, to send you some message, because they simply couldn't have made a movie like this unless they were. You might find yourself asking why it was made and what it is about. Really I don't get that either. But maybe I am not comprehending enough to see it. But I still liked it. Strange. Whatever Kubrick was hinting at, I'm sure it was something important. I think the title had some meaning, too, but I don't know what it is. Kubrick liked to challenge people by making his movies a very different experience than most. The personal experience I had was that I learned I can still like a movie that is slow and very weird. Maybe everyone has their own reactions to this film. That was mine. But I can tell you this: I'm gonna go check out some more Kubrick films after seeing this.",Null,0,0,7 August 2002
Titanic," The only thing horrible about this is its rating.
","A 7.0? Are you kidding me? I have read all the comments on this movie and let me say, there is just absolutely no need for them. Isn't it funny how in the winter of 1997 everybody was going to see this movie, some multiple times, helping it become the highest-grossing movie ever and now they all hate it? I feel bad for Cameron, hopefully he never gets on this website and reads this crap, because he is very talented. Tell me what, exactly, is bad about this movie? Every single excuse I've heard for people hating it are biased opinions based on stupid things. They say they don't like it because of Leo. Okay, there are about a dozen other actors BESIDES Leo here. And he wasn't even that bad, come on, get a freakin' grip! A little note to people who get on here and TRY to be movie critics: you don't rate a movie on the likeability of an actor. That's a selfish OPINION. It's like saying 'I hate Pretty Woman because Julia Roberts wears a red dress and I hate red.' Please. Sure, I get the fact that the love story is somewhat cheesy. But that's only in certain parts of the movie and the movie is over 3 hours. Some more advice: don't rate a movie in pieces. Commenting on the beginning love story and the end with the sinking, what is that all about? A movie is one whole piece of work. How can you just show a ship sinking and not set it up first with a beginning? Everything about this film is spectacular. The music, the sets, the effects, the themes. It shows how Titanic not only changed the world, but the very lives of the people on it. If you'll notice at the end, none of the characters ever really recovered from it. The love story is essential to take you on the inside of the tragedy and see it how people that were actually there saw it. From a victim's eyes. And if you laughed at this movie, then your heart is as cold as the iceberg that sank this ship. Do you laugh when a bomb goes off, killing people? I hope not. 1500 people DIED on this ship, many suffering one of the most horrible deaths (drowning) and never even getting a chance to save themselves. Those that didn't drown were tortured by freezing to death. Stick your hands in ice water and tell me how you would feel being totally immersed in it, slowly dying. Children and babies died. Think about that and tell me how cruel someone has to be to laugh at that. Cameron makes you feel for the people on the ship, something other Titanic movies failed to do. By creating characters we care about and ripping them apart, he creates a true tragedy. It's not a comedy. The last hour is one of the most exhilarating movie experiences of all time. And so is this movie. This is possibly the only case in which a film once so popular will go down forever as being 'gay and a piece of trash.' I guess it's a good thing reviews like these aren't published. Leave that to the professionals, who by the way liked it.",Null,2,5,19 June 2002
Scream 2," Not bad, but don't expect improvement.
","This film is way better than all the other countless teen slasher movies being created out there but in terms of the sequel to the great Scream, it's not like its daddy.The Scream series is almost directly responsible for reviving the horror genre with movies full of teens and masked psychos who always keep their identity sealed until the finale. After Scream, every horror movie copied its formula, hired hot teen actors, and made it a guessing game of who the killer would be. After a while it got too tiring. Now that the trend is dying off and movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween are pumping out more sequels this year, everyone can thank God that movie studios quit ripping off this great series. Sure, Scream started it all, but you have to realize that Scream is THE teen slasher of the '90s. It's the only slasher series that's actually worth a damn, and it's not the movie's fault that other people copied it to death. This series was almost ruined by imitators, making the audiences blame this series.The story is a little different here in Scream 2. The heroine Sidney has graduated and gotten out of Woodsboro to a secluded college. The other survivors have gotten on with their lives, too. Gale the reporter got rich from a tell-all book, Dewey deals with his new limp, and Randy coincidentally attends Sidney's college (what are the odds?). When a new movie called Stab opens, which is the film counterpart to the events at Woodsboro and Gale's book, the past comes back again as another ghost killer stalks Sidney's college buds.This movie delivers on all that Randy promises in the trailer. The body count is bigger, but some of the deaths are inconsequential unlike in Scream when the deaths were major characters. The death scenes are only more elaborate due to the new volume of blood. But compared to Drew Barrymore's scene in the first, this can't hold a candle to that. And the killer(s) should never be assumed dead because are they ever?This movie may seem like a pointless attempt to cash in on the money from the first, especially since not even a year had passed since the first opened, but keep in mind this is a trilogy. Just like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.Not everyone will be satisfied with this. Taking the characters from Scream and shipping them out of Woodsboro takes something out of the  film. Woodsboro was a small town where terrible things were happening and everyone had something to hide. With great scenery and people, the setting was almost a character in itself in the first movie. Now that is all gone, replaced by a college campus. The set-up to murder is all the same here, even the killer's voice, but the scenes lack the impact they had in the first. The first had a better set-up. Most murders were out in the middle of nowhere. These occur on a campus with hundreds of kids about.This movie jokes about sequels never surpassing the original. This movie only helps prove that, but is still definitely worth viewing. It can't beat Scream, but it can almost match it. As part two of a trilogy this movie does just fine. But don't expect it to be an improvement.",Null,0,0,28 June 2002
Jaws," Worth ONE viewing and no more. Overrated.
","Don't let me fool you, Jaws is not a bad movie, in fact it is very technically well made. The acting is good, the score is perfect, and the premise is interesting. Most of all, it really does change the way you think about the water. I, for one, can never again swim in the ocean without hearing John Williams' score in my head and imagining a dorsal fin just off to my left...ugh. But why is that so special? Whoever thought about camping the same way after Friday the 13th, who thought about answering the phone alone after Scream, and picking up strangers after The Hitcher? Yes, it makes you afraid to go into the water, but it IS a film about a killer shark, so shouldn't it do that anyways? Any director could have made you afraid of a shark, who isn't? People act like they were never afraid of anything in the ocean until they saw this movie. Like they never heard of a shark until this. Hello, it was 1975, people were swimming in the sea millions of years before the movie, and yes, they were all afraid of sharks. All Jaws did was bring your attention to it more. Personally when the shark was not eating, I was really bored. Sure, the characters were fine, but I wanted more action. What I get is the three main actors hunting the shark forever (it seemed like that long) on a boat and getting on each others' nerves. Not one of the greatest films of all time. Slow paced, dull, and downright uninteresting except when the shark attacks. I watched it once, but I wouldn't watch it again. Not unless I was really bored. WAY overrated and illogical (sharks don't feed on humans as a food source) and I can't believe it's so popular. WHAT is it about this movie?",Null,0,1,25 July 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best movies I have ever seen.
","Don't listen to ANY negative reviews on this film. Just go out, and buy it. Yes, buy, not rent. Most people who didn't like this will tell you it's a 'fairy tale' and 'cliched', but you will not find a movie that moves you as much as this. This is the reason people see movies. The story is about a man sent to prison for the murder of his wife. He claims to be innocent, but we are never given any proof. Inside, he makes friends with many of the inmates and from that point on, what follows is one of the most brilliant and astounding films ever. Leonard Maltin said the movie was too long. Who cares? I was not bored through a single second of this movie. It held my interest for over 2 hours, and that's no small feat. I haven't read any other critic's reviews on this, and I don't have to. No matter what they say, nothing will ever make me change my mind that this is one of the best films ever made. They can hate it with a passion for all I care, at least us moviegoers know what we like. If you want to see a movie that will change your life, one of those movies that stay with you forever, then go get this. Extremely moving, gripping, sad, and cheerful, you HAVE to see this. From Tim Robbins standing in the rain with his arms stretched to the sky, to Morgan Freeman walking down a sandy stretch of deserted beach in the film's unforgettable ending, this movie truly touched me in a way few movies ever do.

Scream," An entertaining thriller from the good Wes Craven.
","There are a lot of reasons to hate this film, the most abundant one being that this movie inspired other movies like it to follow in its footsteps. However, this was the one that started it all, and although it can be annoying when you look back and see all the material that has been copied from it film after film, it stands alone. This is NOT a horror movie. I don't even know if you could call it a slasher, really. It's basically an entertaining mystery/thriller with gore. A sort of 'Friday the 13th' meets 'Scooby-Doo' detective story -- with teens. The dialogue was cool at the time (1996) and refreshing compared to the sometimes banal dialogue of others before it, but Williamson's script is a little too full of it and dependent on it. This film is notorious for its self-awareness -- the would-be victims have seen the movies we love and have learned a few tips from them. This is of course an original idea, but it takes something away from the atmosphere (who wants hip characters who fight back at the killer and make him look stupid!?). The film tries to be too hip and refreshing that sometimes it loses itself in its own overdone effort to reinvent a dying genre. And a little tip to Williamson: if you want to revive the horror movie genre, don't make a self-depricating parody of it! But overall the real kudos here go to director Craven. He took an okay script and made it into a good thrill-ride worth viewing. I have to hand it to him, what he did with this much overrated material is brilliant -- the opening sequence with Drew Barrymore is stuff made in movie history. And he doesn't cut back on the blood and gore, which is nice because it makes the film more shocking (most mysteries aren't concerned with horror movie tactics). And the killer is pretty damn difficult to guess. Thank God for unpredictability. The only thing the film needed more of, sparing the opening, was real suspense. From the end of the opening on, Craven shifts into overdrive and delivers the movie with shock after shock and good set-pieces with the phone-pranking killer, but he doesn't generate any true suspense. And how scary is an idiot who's most likely a high school student prancing around in a lame ghost costume that, I'm sorry, wouldn't even be scary enough for Halloween night? The costume plain sucks. And what's with all the characters kicking the killer's ass? At one point the killer is slammed with a door, kicked in the head, clubbed with beer bottles, and tripped! Not to mention that he or she always lets the victim get away at first (if he's seen so many horror films, shouldn't he be a little more competent?). Exactly how dangerous is this guy...? Overall, this film is not standard horror and is probably the only scary film between 1996 and 2002 that you should bother seeing, the others in between are all the same. I love the horror/slasher genre like the '80s films and those of the great master Dario Argento and Craven creates a nice outing here. He is a talented director, no one else could have done what he did with Williamson's material. Scary at points, and a great mystery that holds you from start to finish. But this film does make all my favorite (excuse me if they are not Oscar worthy) horror movies look trashy. A movie is supposed to be entertaining, and slashers are. Watch them for fun! And while 'Scream' wastes a lot of time laughing and griping at the horror films that have gone before it, there are a few things it can work on, too -- don't try too hard.",Null,0,0,28 March 2002
Halloween," A milestone.
","Halloween is a huge marker in the history of horror movies. As a low-budget, independent film with no known stars it still managed to become one of the highest-grossing independent films of all time. This, of course, led to many sequels with higher budgets. Back in 1978, it was said that people were jumping out of their seats because they were so terrified. Maybe people in 1978 never saw scary movies, but to jump at a movie like Halloween today would be ridiculous. Over 20 or so years, I think the film's scare tactics are dated. In fact, the whole film is dated. There is absolutely no gore, only a few deaths spread far apart, and no nudity (spare a brief flash of breasts). Still, while this may point out how old the film is becoming, it also points out that John Carpenter didn't need these things to make a good movie. Sure, the film doesn't make people jump or scream anymore, but it still has the power to scare. This film will make you think differently about how safe you are in the comforts of your own home. That's why the film works. Carpenter brings evil home to an innocent and unsuspecting neighborhood. Shots of Laurie, the heroine, show her walking down her neighborhood sidewalks alone, with 'the shape' watching in the background. It'll change the way you think about walking down your street alone. While it's clear that 'the shape' is Michael Myers, the kid who killed his sister in the opening of the movie, that fact is never stated. We never see Michael himself put on the mask and murder kids. He's just left as a being...an entity...devoid of identity. This makes the shape seem more like a thing than a man, which works very well and explains why he keeps coming back after being stabbed, shot, etc. Perhaps the most terrifying thing about this film is how true it is about our modern day society. In this film, forgetting the explanation in the sequels, Laurie and her friends are stalked and killed by the shape for no apparent reason. Later it was revealed Laurie is the shape's (then called Michael, losing that non-person feel) long-lost sister. A bogus explanation. It's much scarier to think that this man is killing these kids for no reason whatsoever. Meticulously stalking them. This is true today with all the serial murders and kidnappings. Were they chosen at random, too? This film also began the trend of mask-wearing psychos. After Jason and many others, the shape's mask is still the most frightening because it has no features. No emotion. I'm not sure if Carpenter hinted at these things on purpose or if they just came out, but Halloween stands as a terrifying reminder that evil lurks out there. No matter where you are, you're not safe. In a world where predators lurk in everyday society, Halloween is a shining example of the threat even an innocent neighborhood can hold. And while the film is very dated, the message still holds true.",Null,0,0,19 June 2002
Halloween," NOT a classic, a HUGE rip-off of Black Christmas!!!
","I am sick to death of everyone saying this is the film that started it all! No it's not! This film is almost a CARBON COPY of another film called Black Christmas, which was released in 1974!!! It's pathetic! Everything they use to make this movie scary down to the killer hiding in the shadows is done FIRST in BLACK CHRISTMAS, and much better, too. The only thing this film should get credit for is starting the horror craze that soon followed. It doesn't deserve anything beyond that! Halloween was IMITATED!? NO! Halloween is an IMITATOR! Watch Black Christmas and look at the opening. It is EXACTLY like Halloween, even using the killer POV shots!!! The plot is just like Halloween except it takes place on Christmas. A killer on the loose, the police searching for him, he kills young girls, hides in the shadows, we see his POV...even the ENDING is like Halloween! The shots used to be 'scary' in Halloween are done here! The acting is way better, the direction is perfect, and the writing flawless! Forget this film and watch Black Christmas. Halloween is a big rip-off that everyone praises. It's not right. Halloween copied Black Christmas and gets all the credit! BLACK CHRISTMAS is THE ORIGINAL CLASSIC! Halloween is a knock-off!!!",Null,0,1,16 July 2002
The Silence of the Lambs," Best Picture?
","This 'psychological' horror stuff always makes me gag. I realize that this type of movie is supposed to scare you through your mind, but it doesn't make a very good movie experience. You have to be totally into the movie to really get what it's trying to do, and that means you can't have any distractions and you have to see what the film is saying. Aren't movies supposed to provide you an hour or two of entertainment? Is that not their purpose? Well I don't find it entertaining having to immerse myself so deeply into a movie simply to get a kick out of it. A good movie should be able to do that anyways. Anthony Hopkins is indeed very creepy, however his over-the-top IQ make him seem more of a prodigy than an insane killer. Plus, he's behind bars (well, most of the movie anyways). Buffalo Bill, the serial killer who's still roaming free is not even scary. In fact, to be scared of this movie is to be scared of watching The Lion King. Psychological thrills? It's a concept that I hope dies out soon. It does not make a good movie. Everyone says that what you imagine is scarier than what you see. If you hear a noise in your house, is that scarier than hearing a noise and seeing some guy with a knife in the corner? I don't think so. Good movies allow you to be terrified without requiring you to look too hard. A good film maker should frighten you by what he puts into the movie, not by what you put into it. It seems that those that can't scare you by what they do with a movie have to make it a psychological thriller almost as a cover-up that they couldn't hack it. It gives them an excuse. So when someone says it wasn't scary, they can call them stupid. Yeah, right. If you made a good movie in the first place...Anyways, see this only for great acting and music. It's not scary at all. The actors may be, but that can't save this movie.",Null,0,0,21 June 2002
Final Destination," Innovative movie wasted on teen audience.
","In Final Destination the characters are all out to keep Death itself from finishing them off since they are supposed to have died anyways in a plane crash. Eerie premonitions, a plot that holds much potential, and a great atmosphere...all gone down the drain with the teen horror garbage. Instead of highly executed characters and a little more fleshing out, the film wastes everything to feed this thing to the gore-hungry teen audience. The issues of death and all its aftershocks could have been buttered up into a better movie overall if the studio had not cast a teen audience and set it among a high school crowd. For the benefit of the doubt there is one cardboard adult character who doesn't make it very long. The opening is flavored with enough eerie fingerfood to make you think you're in for a treat. But as soon as the plane goes kaboom, so does the film. After that, we look forward to whiny teens running around while Death hunts them down in more and more ridiculous ways. Take away the dressy plot and it boils down to nothing more than another slasher. We wait on end while the cast drops one by one. Actually, the death scenes are not the problem, it's the way they are set up and what's in between all the messiness. The characters who don't make it all die fascinating deaths. I use fascinating in the sense that a simple turn of events, the smallest detail, sets off a chain reaction that leads to a very bizarre ending for the unlucky survivors. Death never looked so stylish. Hell, these deaths are downright classy and sleek. Death in this film is like the shiny silver on the blade of a knife. But for all the eye-candy, the holes need to be covered up better. For one thing, why does the main character Alex have a premonition in the first place? Just so Death can play cat-and-mouse? And what's with the stock characters? It's really sad because beneath it's teen horror goofiness are the blueprints for a fine film. All they had to do was scrape off all the bubble gum. The film reaches heights when it deals with the survivors reactions to all the stuff happening to them, and their view on Death. The film touches on loneliness, fear, and rejection. A character study begun and not finished. In the end, it is all swept away for the Clearasil crowd.",Null,1,1,29 January 2003
Rear Window," Wow!
","Let me start off by saying that I am a young man, so by the time I was born Hitchcock was already dead and most movies were already learning how to capture audiences with explosions and special effects. Therefore, watching any movie made after 1980 was pretty hard for me, I simply didn't grow up in that time. But hearing all the rave about Hitchcock's films, I decided to give it a shot. I went to the video store and saw Rear Window on DVD. I almost balked when I looked at the year it was made and almost put the thing back on the shelf but something made me check it out. I was not disappointed. At first, it seemed slow and boring, not enough thrills for my taste. I was about to turn it off by the time that nurse came back again, but I just made myself watch. Things started to pick up and the rest is history. By the end of the film I was gripping my chair and with my pulse pounding. Talk about suspense! I never knew I could get so worked up over a movie made in the 1950s, it scared me more than most thrillers I have seen since 2000! I also have never seen a film that only used one set, like this one. To top it off, this movie gave me so many thrills and there were no shootings, no gore, and (I don't think) any special effects! I was really shocked. So many exciting moments, like when Grace Kelly and the nurse go to check out what's buried in the garden, when Kelly is caught in the murderer's apartment, and the climax when the murderer learns who is spying on him and goes to pay him a visit. Terrific stuff, all done using mood other things besides endless visual effects and blood! Needless to say, I can now see that some old movies are not as bad as I have thought, in fact they are better, focusing more on characters and stories than their rock soundtracks and computer images. I don't know if I would recommend this to many people my age, but I do suggest they try it. I did, and I loved it. Thanks to this I will be watching many more classic films now. If it seems slow at first, bear with it and wait. You're in for a great movie.",Null,0,2,30 July 2002
