Catch Me If You Can," A hugely enjoyable, masterfully handled minor Spielberg
","Back in workaholic mode, Steven Spielberg offers up his surprising latest confection a mere six months after the masterful 'Minority Report' - and it's not only the precise opposite of that film's bleak sci-fi dystopia, it's probably his most enjoyable and commercial film in years, which is not to mean it's a disposable lightweight offering. Based on the true story of sixties conman Frank Abagnale Jr., who travelled America posing as a respectable doctor/lawyer/airline pilot and cashing forged cheques throughout but was in fact a New Jersey kid barely out of high school, it's essentially a breezy, swinging comedy where you follow Abagnale's trail of bouncing cheques alongside stoic FBI agent Carl Hanratty, who is always one step behind but begins to come too close for comfort. Underneath the dayglo, Technicoloured gaiety, though, Spielberg is essentially going back to one of his recurrent themes, family and the missing father, since the conman's actions always grow out of his need to earn enough money to make up for his father's debts to the IRS and get his divorced parents back again. However, this is Spielberg's less schmaltzy film in years, preferring instead to play up the free-and-easy smirk of the early to mid sixties (at one point there's a James Bond quote, and it's not an accident), greatly aided by the solid performances of the excellent cast, headed by the rueful Di Caprio as Abagnale and a hilariously deadpan Hanks as Hanratty, with special marks for Walken's poignant performance as the father. Masterfully handled, it's basically a minor entry in Spielberg's oeuvre but undoubtedly his most fun film in years, and it is great fun, even if you can't quite make out why should it run as long as it does - not that you notice.",Null,0,1,7 February 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Harrowing, chilling, idiossyncratic take on the Vietnam war
","Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam war is typically chilling and idiossyncratic, following a Marine platoon from basic training at Parris Island to actual combat during the Tet offensive; but it's the training sequences (the film's first half) that everyone remembers, thanks to the superb performances of Lee Ermey as the brutal drill instructor sergeant and Vincent d'Onofrio as the 'odd man out' that he picks on and eventually leads to a violent breakdown (Ermey was an actual Marine instructor and had originally been hired as the film's technical advisor - then Kubrick got the inspired idea of casting him in the role). The film's muted reception wasn't helped by its timing - after 'Apocalypse Now', 'The Deer Hunter' and 'Platoon', it didn't seem at the time as if Kubrick had put a new spin on the subject. With hindsight, however, the film is as harrowing as any of its predecessors, tracing as it does the de-humanisation of the soldier, his transformation into a killing machine, and following it to its logical conclusion, the war theatre, to see how it all turns out (not surprisingly, the only soldier whose real name we are told instead of its military handle is the only one that never makes it through the training). Majestically directed and photographed, and surprisingly shot entirely on British locations.",Null,0,0,13 April 2003
Spirited Away," No other way to describe it: A masterpiece
","By now Japanese anime master Hayao Miyazaki must be animation's best-kept secret; Pixar's John Lasseter and any number of Disney animators simply revere him, the venerable Mouse House has even decided to help finance him and 1997's 'Princess Mononoke' raised his Western profile. For all of that, though, Miyazaki is still a secret and it would be a shame that, because of it, this touching and incredibly powerful fantasy shouldn't find the international audience it rightfully deserves. Not that Miyazaki is that bothered about it, since 'Spirited Away' has become the all-time Japanese box-office champ, was the first animated film to win the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival and had already cleared $200 million in international box-office before even opening in America (in France alone the film played to two million viewers). Basically, 'Spirited Away' is a modified fairy-tale in the Japanese tradition, following the adventures of ten-year old Chihiro, a moody, spoilt young girl who finds herself trapped in the world of Japanese gods and spirits after her parents take a wrong turn with their car. The only way out of a dismal fate for the girl and her parents is for Chihiro to work in the bathhouse of the gods, where she will live through a series of fantastical adventures. Although what I've just written may make it seem childish, the story is practically unresumable and a lot more strange than it seems, recapturing the edgy nature of the earlier fairytales without ever allowing violence or wickedness inside; even so, it's probably good to leave younger kids at home since some of the images are far too weird for easy explanation. The film works best as a Japanese version of 'Alice in Wonderland' without the witticisms and with an added heart, and is directed by Miyazaki in an effortlessly painterly style that enchants and intrigues at the same time. From its rather non-descript beginnings, 'Spirited Away' develops into a moving parable about learning to know yourself that surprises you at each turn and ends up tugging your heart strings as much as it can without ever yielding to any sort of concessions. There's no other word: this is a masterpiece.",Null,1,2,18 March 2003
Duck You Sucker," Second in Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time' American trilogy is an unjustly forgotten gem
","The least remembered of 'spaghetti western' stylist Sergio Leone's features, probably because within its first half-hour it all but buries the genre the Italian director had helped father with 'A Fistful of Dollars' and then moves on to an unexpectedly epic and lyrical meditation on loyalty and friendship over a bloody, violent revolutionary backdrop. Set in the early years of the 20th century in Mexico, it's the second panel in the director's trilogy about America, completed by the earlier 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and the later 'Once Upon a Time in America', telling of the unlikely friendship that develops between greedy, petty Mexican thief Rod Steiger and idealist Irish dynamiter and former IRA revolutionary James Coburn, who become swept up beyond their own expectations in the uprising led by Pancho Villa. Following on from 1968's masterful 'Once Upon a Time in the West', Leone maps out the last gasp of the outlaw spirit on the way to civilization, underlining the violent and often wayward routes that change often takes - it's no accident that the film is prefaced by a Mao Tse-Tung quote, 'revolution is an act of violence' - and the sacrifices demanded of those involved. It's also a good example of Leone's talents - the film retains the director's unique, in-your-face visual stylings while crossing a number of different genres with striking, surprising ease, and is also surprisingly intimate, since it's (very well) carried by Steiger and Coburn in its entirety, with only one true supporting role and everyone else bit players or extras with little or no dialogue. Many have looked upon it as a political film, but it's not so much about politics as about the way politics impact upon the average person.",Null,1,4,28 December 2002
8 Mile," Surprisingly strong rags-to-riches melodrama
","It's really easy to discard '8 Mile' as the latest attempt from Hollywood at milking a pop cash cow, but in fact this is a surprisingly strong acting debut for star rapper Eminem, who essentially plays a Hollywoodized version of his own rise to fame in this rags-to-riches melodrama that recycles the time-honoured story of the outsider who becomes a star, set in Detroit's derelict urban districts and rap underground of the mid-nineties. Scott Silver's script follows the tried-and-tested rule of the coming-of-age of a young man striving to get out from his no-future life, only this time transferred to the rap world and playing up the inverted race card (a white boy trying to make it in a predominantly black world), but it's really Curtis Hanson's handling that makes it all worthwhile: edgy, nervous, urgent, the on-the-move setups and visceral editing choices (always flowing with the beat and the rhymes) make the best of Eminem's intense, possessed screen presence, permanently attuned to the flow of his lyrics and the demented passion in his eyes. Never shying away from showing an abandoned, apocalyptic Detroit and using it as a setting to enhance the film's do-or-die energy, Hanson proves himself as one of the most astonishingly attuned of contemporary American directors and effectively transcends the initial pop-exploitation concept by turning it into a litany for the American Dream. Eminem certainly can hold himself up there on screen -- it helps that he is playing someone very close to himself and that the supporting cast makes for strong support -- but it remains to be seen if he can hold on playing against type. A great surprise.",Null,0,0,24 January 2003
Gangs of New York," A genuinely impressive, striking and powerful epic
","Martin Scorsese's pet labour of love, a project he'd been trying to set up for nearly a quarter of a century, finally reaches the screen after tales of a turbulent year-long production and rumours of constant arguments with producer and Miramax head Harvey Weinstein, namely over its length (Scorsese's first cut came in at over three and a half hours). The end result, however, is more than worth the wait, since Scorsese, shooting in a massive specially-constructed set in Cinecitt√°, has really given it his all and comes out with one of his most striking and powerful films, even if it's a bit too early to say if it's his best. Sharing the recurrent theme of people caught up in the inexorable march of a history whose symptoms and symbols they are, the film is set against the little-known New York urban riots of the mid-1850s, when the city's slums, an explosive ethnic mix of immigrants from all over the world and resentful first-generation Americans, rose against the tony uptown over the newly-passed conscription law of compulsory military service in the Civil War, setting up an urban civil war of its own. Against this heated political backdrop Scorsese plays out the story of the revenge of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo di Caprio), son of an Irish immigrant gangleader, on Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), a first-generation nationalist and head of the Natives gang who killed his father on a gang fight. The tensions between Vallon and Cutting are used as metaphors of the havoc around them but also of their own specific codes of honour - a son without a father, looking for one in the man who killed his own, but also a father without a son looking for someone to call a son, both of them willing to sacrifice what they hold as sacred to ensure the survival of the bloodline. Breathtakingly directed by Scorsese in a sweeping, operatic flow, 'Gangs of New York' is an old-fashioned political epic that seems strangely attuned to our days and confirms Scorsese as the quintessential American director of his generation and one of the few able to harness material of this scope and size into a film so genuinely impressive.",Null,0,0,18 March 2003
