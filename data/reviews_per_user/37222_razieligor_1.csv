It," More of an 'inspired by' rather than 'adapted from'
","They should have called this 'inspired by' instead of 'adapted from' the Stephen King's book. I understand that they can't fit everything into a movie, otherwise it would have been a 10-20 hours, so they have to cut most of the not very important parts of the books, but I never understand when they change things, and in this case they even add some events that were not in the book, and it wasn't necessary for the plot either. I won't spoil the movie or the book, but if you've read the book, you'll understand, and you won't like the changes and additions. If you haven't read the book, go and read it, you'll understand.Also, I've got chills when I was reading the book, but in the movie it was like an action movie to me. It was not scary at all. I was expecting a darker movie.That being said, acting and cinematography was good. That's why it's not lower than 5 stars. If you haven't read the book, you might enjoy this movie.",5,0,0,27 October 2019
