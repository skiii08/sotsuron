Marie Antoinette," Lousy movie!
","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Kirsten Dunst sure is pretty, but she sure can't act. Reminds me of Kevin Costner when he tried to portray Robin Hood without even a trace of a British accent. The director put in way too much artsy stuff and way too little story. If you really want to know about Marie, don't go to see this movie - what little of the real Marie it presents is highly distorted from the historical record. Oh, by the way, the French Revolution also happened at the same time in history presented in the movie, and, apparently Marie and Louis had something to do with that event, but it's hard to discern that in this movie, as well. Save your money for the next Scooby-Do movie - it'll be better.",1,1,4,29 October 2006
