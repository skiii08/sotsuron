The Finest Hours," Awful rubbish
","Aw, goldarn it, shucks honey! From the opening shot this screamed Turkey and I inwardly groaned that a great story of heroism had been pulped into a simpering stew of sentimental Disney cliché. I admit I got as far as the ship scene thinking it could only get better but nope. As the crew all stood together discussing their impending doom in half a sinking ship, in a gale with 15 meter waves, they barely moved. It was almost as if they were on a stage set, which of course they were. At that point I had had enough and left. There is nothing new about the cinema sausage machine cranking out bland rubbish. There is a huge audience of drooling, infantile morons who will lap this kind of drivel up. It also helps to employ and enrich the less gifted of the artistic community. I then found some cocktail sticks to push in my eyes, trying to drive out from my shrieking memory what I had just seen.",1,9,22,10 April 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A Dreadful Mess smeared from here to everywhere, again!
","It rates a completely unjustifiable 8.1 on the Incredibly Muddled Dodgy Blog, therefore I am only adding this unnecessary review to attempt a balance. The irrelevant extensive additions to the original story add nothing at all, including the ridiculous over-long computer game-esque fight and chase sequences. I admired Jackson for Brain Dead but what he did to the trilogy was smear audience capture clichés all over it after removing far more relevant elements of the story. He has done that here in spades in order to spin it out and keep costs down. Why bother with a plot when you can have another fight sequence or another chase. I'm really, really, really glad I did not pay to watch this and felt very let down by its greedy stupidity after it was lifted from a pretty good yarn by Tolkien. Never mind the complete alteration of a great plot to provide a three letter word guide for the dumdums who managed to sit through the trilogy listening to the ghastly fake Celtic music. AGGGGGGGGGGGGGGH!",1,6,9,1 May 2014
