Blade Runner 2049," not what i expected
",OK I actually went to see this with all the intention of loving it but however I just didn't yea I enjoyed the action and adventure but the length of the movie is very long and some of the movie just seemed blank where nothing really happened but it was decent and enjoyable I will say go see it just remember to get some snacks 'like I said long length movie' and enjoy,7,1,4,4 November 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," really good time
",I don't usually like thor movies for some reason they just don't mesh well with me however this was the complete opposite it was stupendous I loved the action the adventure the humor damn near everything I guess was almost perfect I left the theater smiling knowing I had spent my money wisely seeing this movie and had a blast doing so I can only hope justice league treats me just as good,8,2,7,5 November 2017
Justice League," if your a true dc fan you will love it
",I will for sure say I was more than a little weary about seeing this movie due to the terrible reviews but I knew I had to see it no matter what but I wound up having an awesome time no doubt I had a blast it was action packed and humor filled and it was the perfect movie for the thanksgiving weekend as long as you have older kids 'just no younger kids due to frightening villains and some of the action might be overwhelming for kids under 10 but the movie was a fantastic movie my favorite was wonder woman don't listen to critics go see it and have a good time,10,6,13,24 November 2017
