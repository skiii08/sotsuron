Catch Me If You Can," Leo and the Hankster rules
","I watched 'Catch me if you can' and I really enjoyed it. I very rarely watch films any more because I seem to have a short attention span, but this one had me captivated. The most extraordinary thing is that it's based on true story. I'm not a fan of Leo usually, but he was very believable and the Hankster was great. Although, I was not overly impressed by the way he was initially portrayed as something of a buffoon, only to turn into this sensitive, caring kind of guy. What put me off watching the film originally was the trailer showing Leo surrounded by all the beautiful air stewardesses - this didn't give any clue as to the actual style of the film - how he arranged that was masterful. Throrougly recommended.",8,2,4,3 January 2006
