Casablanca," Emotion is missing in films today
","Hollywood today is a shell of its former self. It struggles to innovate, to inspire us, and to tell a story that 'everyone' can stand behind. Casablanca came at a time, when the world was imploding unto itself. The movie mirrored life at the time. A world war. People split apart by this war. Nations and their people forced to choose what they believe in order to survive. In summary, a disruption of the life everyone knew. Rick and his cafe summarized alittle bit of what this world had become. A story with many stories interwoven inside it. Mystery. Intrigue. Love. Nationalism. It is all mixed together in this realistic storyline. Classics are made because they touch people on a different level than most films. Hollywood outdid itself with this movie. The 'politics' of the film were appropriate, timely, and summarized what everyone felt at the begging of WWII.",10,2,2,15 July 2018

Doctor Strange," Best Marvel Movie
","Seen all the Marvel movies. Have read all the comics since the 1970s. I consider myself a 'super hero' expert, especially with portraying them on the big screen. Dr. Strange is hands down the best one. This is a sophisticated script, well-defined and accurately follows the original story. You won't be disappointed.",10,1,3,12 December 2018
