The King's Speech," Superb movie in all respects
","Our local newspaper printed an article by the movie reviewer of that paper and in the article he praised this film and went on to say how popular it was with Baby Boomers, the people that the movie industry had forgotten, generally, since the '70s. I could not agree more with him; the animated stuff that passes as film in Hollywood is and has been awful. This film is just the opposite of those silly mind-numbing Disney studio time-wasters that call themselves 'movies' today.I was particularly impressed by the excellent direction by Tom Hooper; as I watched, trying to absorb the story, I was continually struck by his direction: the camera angle, the camera elevation, the subtle blending of camera distances (they melded very softly, one into another, without jumping). The set direction was equally excellent with the move from one set into another very masterful even though the range was quite large (rich to not so).The acting was superb: Rush played the Australian perfectly: his character was on new ground dealing with English Royalty and maintaining that Australian 'everyman ease' knowing full well the changes needed but holding back just enough to jolt those 'above' him and cause discomfort to both sides. Colin Firth plays a remarkable role as the king who needs the Australian but who finds difficulty in accepting help; the tension between all parties makes for a movie that (highest accolade) will be remembered for many years.",10,1,3,8 January 2011
Angels & Demons," An excellent movie experience!
","Diane and I finished an unusual day today by seeing the second of two movies on alternate days, something that does not happen often. Yesterday was Baader Meinhof and today Angels and Demons: two movies at opposite ends of the viewing spectrum; movies nonetheless that were both hugely satisfying for very different reasons.Angels and Demons was, as Diane was at pains to tell me, a film not to be taken seriously: character development was at a minimum, like popular novels it was plot driven, action supersede history in many instances and the actors actions sometimes don't fit the plot. However, having said these negatives, I found the movie to be about as good an action film as one will find: very fast paced, beautifully filmed (taking optimum advantage of Rome's beauty) and complexity melding into story very satisfactorily.I thought Howard's direction was excellent. As with The Code, he managed to handle big scenes, a big script, many characters and many locations extremely well. I thought his shot selection as well as the cinematographer's camera work meshed together to give the film a hugely satisfying breadth. I am a fan of Tom Hanks and I thought he carried his character's role very well. He seemed like a college professor to me and he made the transition from researcher to investigator believably through the entire film. Our only trouble with the action was the fact that driving as quickly as the story demanded through Roman traffic took a fair bit of digesting but, hey, this is a movie not a documentary.It is a truism that Hollywood morphs itself into what they believe to be the zeitgeist of the particular political times at hand; Hollywood in the eight years of Bush conservatism produced many, many hugely ridiculous films and this, made during but released after, is one of only a few exceptions. The worse thing about attending commercial Cineplex's is sitting through the mind numbing previews; maybe that is why I enjoyed this film as much as I did. I don't think so though; it is an excellent film, one easily worth an afternoon or evening.",9,5,16,14 May 2009
Frost_Nixon," History's sky is clouded with strange men.
","What a sleeper of a movie; who would have ever thought that a movie about an interview would ever sustain interest for as long as this gem. Diane and I lived through all of these events but they happened in the months of our migration to Australia so those events come through history's washer a little more soiled than I would like. This wonderful movie passes through those amazing events easily and renders their complexity clearer. As I commented earlier, watching a reasonably long movie about a TV interview does not, superficially, sound as something that would fly. However, in the hands of superb actors, an excellent script and director and you will be present at a great viewing experience.I thought the movie focused brilliantly on the complexity of Nixon.Â  The depth of feelings enunciated by Nixon in the telephone call to Frost before their explosive final interview showed a man who felt so strongly about the society that surrounded him that he allowed those feelings to cloud the decisions he made during his presidency. The movie touches only briefly on those actions because the script examines the drama between Nixon and Frost and that drama certainly provides the viewers with substance enough. Given the depth of his feelings one can only draw parallels with the new American president Barak Obama who,although a graduate of Harvard law school, journeyed to the presidency from a modest background so similarities are present. This is a history film but it is so much more complex than that. It is an examination of a complex man who dealt, obviously incorrectly, with a weight of personally historical demons.",9,4,7,22 January 2009
Walk the Line," There should have been a double Oscar.
","Don't ask me why the academy chose not to nominate Phoenix for an Academy Award; I just watched the film and was hugely impressed with his depiction of Cash. Not only could he sing the famous Cash songs beautifully but he also had the stage actions down virtually perfect. I loved watching how he played Cash and his stage movements with his guitar-no other performer that I know carried his guitar behind his back and moved it around as he did on stage and Phoenix copied his moves perfectly.I have read reviewers that were disappointed in Phoenix and his depiction of Cash so I went to the film expecting to be disappointed-how wrong I was. From the opening at Folson Prison with the music's heavy beat leading to Cash's stage appearance, I could see Cash in the interpretation that Phoenix gave-I had no trouble, particularly by the end, thinking that Cash was still with us and I was watching a live performance. In my opinion the various reviewers missed with their interpretation this time around.Margold's direction and his script writing can not be faulted. All in all I thought the film was superb and much underrated, with great acting, great singing and set decoration right out of the period.Even if you don't like country music, make every effort to see this wonderful film.",10,1,2,7 March 2006
3:10 to Yuma," Not a chick flick!
","I hadn't seen an American western in many years until I watched this beauty several days ago. Thank goodness Cruise turned the project down because Crowe is brilliant and I can't imagine another actor imbuing the role with the nuances of dread and then gentle bon homme masking a sinister nihilism. Crowe very deftly moves from one into the other leaving me slightly tensed wondering which side he will light on and therefore where will the character go now.Movies generally do not imprint themselves in my memory because of the acting but 3:10 to Yuma is the exception that proves the rule. Christian Bale virtually matched Crowe in his portrayal of Dan Evans who carried as much emotional baggage, albeit nuanced and therefore slow to become unmasked as the film progressed. The movie should be seen if only to watch this superb pairing of actors at war with each other throughout the film.Strangely, the one other bit that I noticed immediately was the Confederate officer's coat worn by Ben Foster's character, Charlie Prince (I apologize if I am wrong about the character). My little pet theory revolves around the fact that the American West was so lawless and, dare I use the word monstrous, because the Civil War had just finished ten or twenty years earlier and those thousands of out of work Confederate soldiers descended on primarily Yankee settlers as well as Indians having their land stolen from under them--not a pretty mix. Putting a major outlaw character in a Confederate officer's coat makes, in my opinion, a hugely strong historical statement.",10,2,5,22 February 2008
Skyfall," There can be no need for more action
","Diane and I saw this wonderful movie this afternoon and at least I and probably she also were stunned by the amount of choreographed action sequences. I watched the entire older Bond films last year on TV in a retro-viewing of them and I found too much action and not enough intrigue. Skyfall was much the same as those older script outlines but having said that I found this new Bond film more edgy but saddled with too much new century action. It reached the point of me wondering when it was all going to end. I gave the film a 9 because it was an excellently worked action film but with no 'twists' and little suspense; this action however, was good enough to maintain our interest In terms of the acting: Judi Dench is memorable as are the other players with on-screen time and speaking roles. The destruction in the action sequences is truly amazing and the cities where it takes place also deserve billing because they provide an extraordinary tableau upon which these sequences are played. Watch this film and this last sentence will make perfect sense. Even if you come away with niggling little concerns as deleted in my observations you will still, almost certainly, have enjoyed your afternoon or evening.",9,1,7,11 December 2012
Marie Antoinette," An exceedingly valuable view into 18th century French royalty.
","I was absorbed from the first scenes of this wonderful and valuable film. The cinematography of the horses and carriages while Marie was traveling to France from Austria to meet her French betrothed set the mood for the remainder of the film. Perhaps I am making too much of it but I felt I was looking at a particularly good home-movie rather than a big-time Hollywood costume drama. I realize that it is impossible even with the best of intentions to historically create a costume drama from centuries of hindsight but Coppola, at least to me, carried it off superbly.Diane had read a biography of Marie and everything in the movie was accurate to that biography. I would suggest that any student of royalty in this period or any other should examine this film to see just how weird royal life was. As I said the journey from Austria to France seemed to be a metaphor for the drama that unfolded at Versailles when Marie becomes the French prince's bride. As someone always interested in history, I was fascinated be the peeks provided by Coppola into the daily life of someone caught in this royal merry-go-round.The scene where Marie gives birth to the heir is fascinating. I guess if you want to make sure that there can be no baby switching and that the heir to the throne is really the heir to the throne, then you have twenty or more people standing around watching the birth--not just a doctor and accompanying nurse. I was struck throughout the movie about the public nature of being royal; seemingly everything you do was accompanied by people watching your every move. I guess for these reasons I will never forget this movie because I have never seen scenes like the ones Coppola wrote and directed.I would urge anyone who has any curiosity about just how royalty actually worked, to make every effort to see this wonderful film.",9,0,1,18 January 2007
Finding Neverland," The way movies should be made: if you believe!
","Diane and I just watched this fabulous movie on TV and we are both still moved by all that we saw. I had no idea what I was about to watch so all of these thoughts are purely from the heart. It would be difficult to watch the final minutes of this movie without tears in your eyes because it touched so many pieces of any persons's heart: family and personal death, marriage breakup, family strife plus the year by year struggle to be true to one's art. All of these elements plus many more pepper this sensitive, well acted, well written and well produced movie that is everything that a movie should be and then some. There is no need to mention any person in particular because all of the parts of a modern film were superbly worked: direction, set design, lighting and of course the superb photography. It was all there in spades! It is a rare thing, even with wonderful films, to finish one and be happy that you finally saw it and that something so good did not miss your attention. your attention; this is one of those cinematic moments.",10,3,3,31 January 2012
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," A masterful non-Hollywood movie beautifully filmed.
","I should have seen this movie earlier but seeing it at this late date after release did in no way diminish the tremendous enjoyment of the film.  I admit it-I love non-American films-even if those films are American products.  But this was so totally non-Hollywood in texture, locations and substance that I can easily forgive the intrusion of Hollywood personalities.The script, the acting and the remarkably beautiful cinematography were so engrossing that the minor problems of plot simply were drowned in beautiful images. John Toll's brilliant camera work immediately impresses the viewer-so good that this viewer will rent the video more just to appreciate the beautiful play of light and dark in the screens images.  I honestly felt that those images were three dimensional-that they could be lifted from the theatre and carried away.Early on in his career, I watched Cage in what I thought was a dog of a film-something about angels in white robes standing on California beaches and subsequently dismissed him but after watching Corelli I must reassess his work-I thought the casting of him as the semi-professorial Corelli was a master stroke.To make any comment on the events that occurred on Corelli's island is to trivialize those events because somebody sitting in Fremantle looking back can never appreciate the monstrousness of what happened.  Hindsight is not an aide in this  case but I do believe that movie magic was laid before viewers of this film.",Null,2,4,3 January 2004
Argo," Far better than I expected.
","As I said, Argo took both of us by surprise; we only knew the basic framework of the story and we were both unprepared for the intensity of the unfolding drama that to us seemed to begin in the first minutes of the show.I admit to not being an Affleck fan but kudos to where they belong; his direction was masterful as well as his portrayal of Tony Mendez who was on camera so much during the film. I am also not a fan of Hollywood movies but when the guys in Tincletown get it right, they can produce movies that are unique to them; even the bad Disney movies with talking animals is unique (what else can you say about them).I cannot say much about Argo. I have never been in Ira; I only know their great revolution from history and regarding the American hostage situation, my information is conspiratorial from progressive web sites. Those sites are fascinating with darkened reflections on the election of Reagan followed the next day by a deal to free the hostages. It was all too clever and coincidental for belief.I would strongly suggest that you watch the film. It is very good, in our humble opinion.",9,2,4,20 November 2012
The Notebook," A hugely surprising film from Hollywood.
","I watched this wonderful, beautiful film last night knowing absolutely nothing about it and was totally captivated by its softness, delicacy and truth-a combination not often seen in American movies. I saw no crime, no bloodshed and no guns but the human drama that was played out before our wet eyes was that which we can all relate to through all the convolutions of human existence.I don't watch movies that I don't think I'll like; therefore, in the first minute I know that this is going to be watchable and if it is, then I have no eye for mistakes-if the movie has swept me in I am its captive and I will care nothing for possible mistakes. If I'm not mistaken the first scene was that beautiful image of Noah rowing a boat in the darkening evening on one of those lugubrious South Carolina rivers-I was hooked! I was not disappointed until the house lights came on at the end and I have nothing but superlatives for the acting, the script, the camera work, as well as the direction. Just the staging with those beautiful classic cars rolling around rural Carolina should be enough to win over any naysayer.Do yourself a favor-see this film and choose a dark area of the theatre with few people around.",Null,1,1,13 September 2004
Elizabeth," Easily the best costume drama I've seen.
","I've seen Elizabeth twice and intend to see it many more times in the future.  I cannot vouch for the veracity of the story line in all its details but of the history that I do know I believe that it is accurate, varying only in slight creative manipulations.  In my opinion, beyond the wonderful work of Blanchett and Rush, the extraordinary visual pallet of the Director, Shekhar Kapur, puts Elizabeth into another realm of movie enjoyment.  People should see the film just to see the directorial brilliance of the way in which Kapur literally 'paints' the screen, allowing the main characters to move within a visual richness that is truly a feast for the eye of the soul.",10,0,4,30 January 2000
Alexander," Will there ever be a better classical/historical film?
","I have just returned from watching one of the best movies I have ever seen, regardless of the historical period but easily the best ancient history epic! Stone's direction was near perfection; the cinematography by Pieto was faultless as was the acting and the music and the casting and the effects-if you think I love this film, you are right.Did I think that the film was an accurate portrayal of the events, as we know them-YES! Will I ever see a better depiction of events that took place in fourth century BC-NO! I also will take bets that this film may very well go down the same gurgler as Michael Cimino's, 'Heaven's Gate'-perhaps the best western yet made. I have purposely not read anything about this film except faint media rumblings about it's unsuccess at the box but no more than that. I don't know why it was disliked but none of that negativity could or should be directed to Stone. His images were totally absorbing from the opening credits-which, by the way, were superb. After sitting through them, I was hooked and the camera work just took me in deeper and deeper.The first battle scene against the Persian army under Darius should be a text book presentation about how to film ancient combat. This was followed at the end of the film by an even more remarkable battle between the Greeks and an Indian army with elephants-as accurately portrayed as it could possibly be. I am aware of society's abhorrence of cruelty to animals but in all my years of watching films, this morning was the first time that I have ever seen animals looking like moving pin cushions. That must have been the way battle was in ancient war-just a bit of Stone's eye for detail.By all means see this movie if for no other reason than to see the director's shot selection as well as Prieto's camera work-a brilliant combination!",10,2,10,22 January 2005
Match Point," Perhaps the Master's best.
","I am a self confessed coward when it comes to movies and I mentally threatened myself many times that I would walk out of this wonderful film simply because it was too strong for me. At the end, however, I was glad I had stayed for the absorbing twist that ties the movie all together.The script was a tough one for me. Allen wrote it beautifully with the tension slowly building like a spring wound too tight but with nothing that can be done to release the tension; the inevitability of the drama that unfolds made for seat-squirming for a coward like me. Alen's direction was superb; as I mentioned the tension was built slowly but inexorably to the climax. His directional timing was brilliant and all of the cast worked together perfectly.Allen's shot selection was also superb as was Adefarasin's cinematography and Cardine Smith's set decoration. The visuals of Match Point were therefore as stunning as the acting and as one critic wrote, 'This may be Woody Allen's best film ever'. I believe that assessment to be totally accurate!",10,1,3,3 March 2006
Youth," English and Film majors should be able to find meaning
",I got caught with this one; I like the movies I choose to see but this was pretty poor. Diane and I saw it this arvo on the strength of Michael Caine's presence but the script as well as the direction and editing let him as well as both of us down.I confess at the outset that I do not like films by the Cohen Bros. or their trendy ilk probably because I have watched too many Australian films which are the exact opposite of these trendy Euro movies. I kept thinking while I watched this sharply cut piecemeal movie that it was very much like a metaphor for contemporary cooking where the plate has a dab of three or four sauces daintily spotted around the plate with small serves of the main course: it no doubt appeals to some but not to my taste. The comparison I am trying to make involves the piecemeal way the film is assembled which is very similar to the 'deconstruction' of contemporary food on a plate. I don't like to reassemble food that I am eating nor do I like to assemble a movie that I am viewing. I will not repeat the substance of the script but just be prepared for a segmented story with some excellent acting as well as all the other components that constitute a modern movie. It is the script and directorial problems that let the picture down.,5,3,5,15 January 2016
Milk," The past, the past; save us from the past.
","Diane and I watched this absorbing film at Luna SX yesterday and we both shared the same feelings for Van Sant's brilliant film. She and I left San Francisco the year Milk first ran for Supervisor in '73 after having lived there for some time so the film was a marvellous look back at an era that has now become a dusty memory. I am not first-hand familiar with the events after Milk's election and death but was in The City before the Castro was the Castro as it is now; before the Haight lost its way and when the street cars were still green and cost a dime to ride. I was totally involved in the film; it could have been made in any city because the location did not matter ( except for the progressiveness of the post-Beat and Hippie lifestyle); the actors led by Sean Penn became the people they portrayed. I left San Francisco before Harvey Milk became known but after seeing some of the footage of him, mixed with Penn's film footage, I am convinced that the Academy was absolutely right in its decision to award Penn the Best Actor award.I thought the movie was paced perfectly; Van Sant kept the tension high throughout the movie. I did not realise that there was so much conservatism in San Francisco at the time. I did not realise that homophobia was so rife because now conservatives across America believe firmly that The City is Hell itself and many would be quite happy if it were expunged from the country all together. I should, in hindsight, not be so surprised because it was common before I left to see bumper stickers reading,' AmericaÂLove It or Leave It' so I took the hint and left; Milk didn't and the rest, as they say, is history.We thought that Milk was a brilliant movie; a mixture of history, powerful politics and superb acting, particularly by Sean Penn. I hope that the American heartland comes to grip with itself, grow up a little and stop seeing visions of evil hiding throughout the homes. Milk shows that political and social growth can occur but only if that evil hand of religion stays gloved and in churches.",10,3,8,27 February 2009
Hotel Rwanda," This movie is the most distressing I've ever watched!
","My wife and I watched this movie in Fremantle yesterday afternoon and although I had a rough idea about what I was about to watch, the actual movie was far stronger than I had anticipated. The producer, director and writer, Terry George, must be congratulated for bringing to the screen such a horrendous story and yet making that story palatable to the extent that it is nominated for Academy Awards in a number of categories. Beyond that I was struck by the deftness with which he handled the unthinkable through elucidating the reasons the civil war massacres were taking place-the anger that motivated the participants. So often writers leave the audience in complete dark as to these motivations for some terrible event-the perpetrators are: simply fill in the words-mad, evil, stupid, directed, etc. We disagree with the bloodletting but we have no reasons to account for it.Georges decision to cast Dan Cheadle in the lead role was inspirational-Cheadle handled a demanding role so well that I thought I was watching TV footage or a documentary. All the actors were superb and all contributed to this total feeling of 'realness.' I could talk about every person on the screen but perhaps my favourite was Fano Mokoena who played the Huto general who maintained the hotel sanctuary. Beyond Mokoena was Nick Nolte's portrayal of a Canadian Peace Keeper-I love Nolte's work but this small role was one of his best.Please see the movie-it's one of those rare movies that has so much light to shed on a piece of history people would rather not see.",Null,2,2,20 February 2005

Capote," A soul-search into the heart of darkness.
","I have very mixed thoughts about this wonderful movie; mixed thoughts about what I am supposed to focus on after watching the soul of two people. Am I to focus on the writer Capote or the murderer Smith because after leaving the theatre I was drawn between a character analysis of both people. I suppose Capote would have thought similarly because the most memorable line of the film was when Capote compared his upbringing to Smith's when he said, roughly, we were raised in the same house and when we left, he went out the back door while I went out the front. This in a sentence is why I admire the film so much; it is rare to watch a film that can so thoroughly study the characters of two leading players in a film. Many films seem to exaggerate plot to the extent that the characters are only talking vehicles to add colour to the car chases and violence. Capote was that extremely rare American film that went deeper than the superficiality of the obvious.I read the boards with viewer comments about this film and found them to be fascinating reading. I remember seeing Capote on TV and from those memories I thought Hoffman's portrayal of Capote was perfect. The Oscars should have given a double award because Hoffman was perfect as was Joachim for Cash-they could have been recognised equally.The Set Decoration by Decter and Russel was outstanding as was the overall Set Decoration by Gonclier. Recreating so accurately a time and place far away geographically as well as chronologically was a tough call and they accomplished it extremely well.Capote is truly a memorable film and richly deserves its many accolades.",10,0,0,21 March 2006
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," There is little that can be said about a perfect movie in this space.
","Diane and I saw this brilliant film yesterday; it is a film that will not dissipate from our minds like a morning fog when the sun begins to shine. Both of us found the movie something that will remain in our thought for a long time.In commenting on the film, the first thing that comes to mind is the richness of the pool of acting talent that becomes available to the director. The first is the Little person, besides the leads, he steals the screen whenever he appears. The mother of the 'bad guy' takes scenes equally quickly. In short, the Director placed marvellous actors in all the roles needed; there were no soft spots where actors regardless of screen time were felt by the viewers to be 'playing' at their roles.Finally the mains: the actors that wrestled with the primary roles. The primary sources have had a field day distributing well-deserved accolades to all the great actors spread throughout the movie. Out of many such remarkable speeches that stood out was the mother's criticism of the Catholic Priest; it is worth the price of entry by itself.",10,4,8,13 January 2018
Lion," An India you expected; a story that perhaps you didn't.
","Diane and I saw this memorable film today and she, more than I, (her words, found it 'enthralling'); however, I saw it as a movie that captured my attention and kept that attention throughout the film.Diane is more sensitive to the soft nuances of a screenplay, and she thought that, particularly the Direction, brought out the best in the actors. I know that this comment seems to be more about her thoughts than mine; however, I did see in the movie all her comments about what we saw on the screen. The plot is known to all aficionados of the moving screen but to see the actors draw substance out of a script that devours so many minutes of screen time is a delicious watch. The fact that the action takes place in the visually delightful country of India is a feast for the eyes to use a trite saying but the cinematography brings out India's horrendous poverty. SEE THIS MOVIE!",10,0,3,9 March 2017
Hugo," Easily one of the best of the decade
","Ah, before reading my 'drivel' the reader should realise that I am one of those brain dead morons who thought that Hugo was a brilliant movie. Certainly it is not a Ben-Hur or Deer Hunter but it was not conceived to be a movie like those that were on a much larger canvas. In my opinion you should not compare apples and oranges,they are too dissimilar just as these huge movies must not be compared to smaller personal dramas like Hugo. The movie was first and foremost set driven and script driven and Scorsese's brilliant direction brought the film together. Not being connected with the industry I would think that this type of movie would be very hard to direct (as opposed to some of the 'Haters')because the plot demands the ability to assembly disparate elements in a complex script peppered with many subtleties. Lo Schiavo's Set Direction was beyond any criticism; she turned literary words into concrete reality in a very complex movie. The media is right in my opinion!",10,14,22,2 February 2012
Salt," The best kind of Action movie
","Diane and I saw this film today without knowing anything about it and we were both surprised and satisfied (although tired) at the end of the movie; tired because it requires visual concentration and mind concentration to follow the script ins and outs. I think that I have sat through enough Hollywood thrillers to pretty much know how a film will play out without, of course, knowing the exact sequence of events in the script but Salt was very different. From the opening scenes of the film all the way through, the action just kept happening. To me, there were no quiet moments where the various elements of the plot were allowed to come together and give the viewer a little break to catch their breath; the pace of the film was somewhere around 95% for the entire film.Salt was directed by Phillip Noyce, an Australian director, and he kept the film rolling very quickly. I must hand it to him, or to the Editor (or both probably) because the physical action scenes were very deftly cut. Jolie (not that I am that knowledgeable about her roles) was asked to do some amazing bits of physical fighting and the action was cut quickly giving the viewer a high speed ride through much of the film. The action was pretty much nonstop through the film and it was truly a fantasy because the action was just for video games and comic books because it was improbable. That is not to denigrate the film in any way but if you see it do not leave the theatre disappointed because it was make-believe. Of course it was but it was also a terribly good way to spend an afternoon.",9,1,4,6 September 2010
Apocalypse Now," My greatest movie experience!
","Diane and I watched this movie last night many years after our first viewing when it was initially released and we both were almost incredulous at the complexity, power and brilliance of the movie. I had thought that Deer Hunter was the most important and powerful movie to originate from the Vietnam War but after last night I realise that I was badly mistaken. In a way I did not understand that it was possible to make a movie as powerful as Apocalypse Now; I did not realise that one person could assemble the actors and the script and select the camera shots that could produce what we watched last night.Beyond the superb movie making, there is the consideration about the film's alleged anti-Americanism because of the surreal overview of the war. Personally, from my reading and absorption of war visuals, I found the movie all too real. Of course Coppolla exaggerated, massively, but this exaggeration was based on the truth of this extraordinarily nasty war. As crazy as he made events look, read a book called 'Bloods-An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans' and I am sure you will finish it thinking that Apocalypse Now was almost a fairy tale. Maybe many veterans do not want to admit to themselves the horrors that America inflicted on an innocent people but it did happen. I am not a complete neophyte with cinema although I do confess to a huge lack regarding the technicalities and subtleties of the movie making process; however, after having said this even I was amazed at the quality of each individual scene which, under a lesser hand, could have constituted an entire movie project on its own. The brilliance of the scene of Duval's village attack, the French dinner party and the final cataclysm with Kurtz each of which has total standalone brilliance is beyond us mere humans to appreciate.Is it the century's best?",10,0,1,12 January 2008
Save the Last Dance," Enough truth to make whites uncomfortable
","I rate movies by whether or not I can remember what I just sat through and this was definitely memorable-yes, it was cliche'd but as with most cliche's if you take the trouble to shake them a little and peer under the cliche'-mat you'll find, in this case, enough truth to give pause for reflection.Living as I do far removed from the cultural centre of this film, I found the juxtaposition of a white kid thrust into a black school a change from the opposite which seems to be a more popular play on the race scenario. Given some background in racially one sided schools I didn't feel uncomfortable with the flow of the storyline.  Of course the script placed the actors in 'cliche'd' story lines but there are few stories of any kind that don't.  I don't think the movie suffered by doing this any more than Staying Alive did for the white disco subculture of the Seventies.Save the Last Dance gave me an opportunity to peek, however furtively, into a social milieu of contemporary culture that would, in it's absence, be closed to me.I loved the film and I respected the film and recommend it to anybody looking for a peek into another culture.",Null,0,2,22 February 2004
Dreamgirls," A fabulous look-back at the Boomer's engine room.
","Diane and I saw this brilliant movie this afternoon and I am in awe of the magnificent performances that graced the screen. I had to take away one star because of my disdain for musicals in general but thankfully the musical numbers were short and the vocals were excellent. New York musicals do not fit with Motown and I did not realize that form played such a role in a story whose roots were in Detroit. I was also sorry that the singing was modern meaning that the musical numbers were not the originals as I had expected and therefore the magic of Holland-Dozier-Holland was missing; however, these are probably minor points for the great mass of the viewing public.Yes, Murphy probably did play his greatest role to date. And yes, if Jennifer Hudson was only voted into sixth on American Idol then the voting public for that show needs their heads thoroughly examined. If anybody ever makes a film biography of the great Aretha, then Hudson should be a shoe-in for the role.I thought the way in which the movie wove the stories of the different characters together was wonderful storytelling. The chronological changes seen in the costumes and props as the movie progressed was a credit to the production crew.Any Boomer reading this should absolutely see this film, even if you don't like, even a little, musicals.",9,1,2,29 January 2007
The Intouchables," Omar Sy makes the movie his own; see it for his performance!
","Diane and I saw this remarkable movie two days ago and we both laughed and cried and wondered at the first-rate performances particularly by Omar Sy who masterfully played the Senegalese guy who became Francois Cluzet's carer.The story, superficially, is a simple one of a quadriplegic guy who hires a new carer to do everything for him because he has no movement from his neck down. The guy he chooses to be his new carer (he is extremely rich also) is a Senegalese migrant who needs the work but has absolutely no training. The movie, and it's very funny, revolves around this strange relationship between the white guy who can do so little for himself and the black guy who can do everything for both of therm. The episodes this African guy gets the white guy into constitute the bulk of the movie and I would put it on your list of can't miss films.The Intouchables explores the strange blocks that are put in the way of people trying to make a life with a severe handicap: Cluzet's character must overcome his physical disability and Sy's character must overcome his race in a city that prides itself on being proper which means having no colour. They use each other's handicap to their own advantage with wonderful movie delights for the viewer.I was taken by how Driss, Sy's character, used his remarkable force of character to over awe all the people that he needed to do something different: his relations, people going about there daily business or virtually anyone in which he came into contat.",10,1,2,10 November 2012
To Rome With Love," A curious but endearing film.
","Diane and I watched Allen's film this afternoon in Fremantle and although we agree on virtually every film we see, To Rome With Love is the exception that proves the rule. I did not mind the film, in fact, I thought that its quirkiness was very endearing and I enjoyed the afternoon's viewing but then I enjoy Woody Allen more than Diane does. She found the whole business of New York Americans swanning around Rome too hard to take but I just found the movie too peppered with great actors to dislike the film.People probably already know that the film is segmented into a number of parts; two of which are Italian and two are about American visitors to Rome. They are in the Eternal City for differing reasons and the substance of the film concerns the individual episodes of their life with the beauty of Rome as the background. Because of the vignettes it is easy to have likes and dislikes about each of them but to me the glue holding them together was the quirkiness to Allen's script. I suppose love could be singled out as the movie's theme but this theme (if it is such) becomes so stretched that it morphs into a high school essay topic.As one would expect with this calibre of actors at work the professionalism is constantly on display. The script, because the Master wrote it, is also of a high calibre even if the twists and turns might cause you to pause on this matter. Take the film as it is and do not wrestle with it too much; it is a very entertaining film and certainly deserves an afternoon or evening of your time in viewing it.",9,3,7,19 October 2012
Before Sunset," Dialogue delivery beyond excellent!
","I watched this wonderful movie yesterday afternoon and both my wife and I are still more than a little stunned by the beautiful manner in which Paris was laid before our eyes and the realism of the dialogue and delivery  by Hawke and Delpy.I was completely taken by the naturalness of Delpy's delivery-I would have bet that it wasn't a film if I had just heard her speaking and not known that it had been scripted.  Dare I say that it could have been Reality TV in that the dialogue was written so accurately and delivered so well; I have never watched a fictional movie that was so realistic before-it was so natural.Having given these fulsome praises to Before Sunset I must also say that the director, Linklater, made an extraordinarily courageous film-a film that I would have bet would never be made because Hollywood does not make movies with only dialogue and no action.  Nothing outwardly happens in this film-why would you ever believe that two people walking through quiet Parisian streets and setting in old cafe's could make a movie that would hold it's audience.  Maybe the new generation creating movies in Hollywood has decided that people don't always want to watch talking robots and moving plasma-maybe the French have known all along what makes a movie. 
In any event-I thought this film was a film maker's film and it is a pearl among coal lumps.",Null,2,3,15 August 2004
The Pianist," I feel dumb that I did not watch this brilliant film earlier.
","Fortunately my wife convinced me to see this film on TV several nights ago; initially I was reluctant because I thought that it would end up being too tough for a overly sensitive softy like myself-how wrong I was! Polanski's film was not what I had expected; in all the publicity surrounding his return to films, I had failed to grasp the substance of the film. In hindsight this surprises me because for many years I have been curious as to why film makers had not focused on the extraordinary events of the Warsaw Ghetto and its eventual destruction by the Nazis. I have always thought that this event was one of the most powerful of a string of events that have been overlooked by film makers for years. The enormity of all that happened from '38 to '45 seem to have prevented people from mining the history of those years. It is conceivable that producers feel there is a fatigue clause at work here, meaning that there is possibly a feeling by producers that the public might be tired of non-military war films. Another possibility concerns the Jewish people themselves-a concern that they do not want this terribly painful history to be mined simply to provide fodder for film makers. Whatever the reason, there is to my mind a noticeable absence of films about these monumental but painful events of the mid twentieth century.Even given the drawbacks associated with watching a film on the small screen, this movie immediately gave the impression that it had the touch of genius about it. Polanski's superb direction; Brody's superb acting and Edelman's brilliant cinematography impart the stamp of excellence on the film. I am a film viewer who watches films as collections of images so Edelman's work knocked me out! The beauty of the clarity and darkness of the camera work was wonderful to watch. POlanski's shot selection of course allowed Edelman ample canvas upon which to paint in those wonderful grays and muted colours that were eventually seen on the screen. Diane and I have the tape of the film and it will definitely be watched many times in the future. In short, the film is as good as the awards that it justifiably received.",10,4,8,12 March 2005
Lawrence of Arabia," They can't make um like this anymore!
","Wow, this is about all I can say about this sensational movie that D and I finished watching last night. Of course, we both had seen it when it was first released 48 years ago but to watch it again after being somnambulated by the stuff passing themselves off as movies today brings a whole new experience to movie viewing.I know that economics has forced movies to cut their extra's budget and again, it was refreshing to see real people filling the screen rather than computer magic. The 60s, 70s and 80s really was a period of renaissance in the film industry because they were not constrained by the need to film in a studio. However, what brought the renaissance to an end was the cost of making contemporary movies with all the extras and other assorted needs, in this case horses and camels. Now we have movies of cartoon characters, probably because it is cheaper to hire an animator than an actor.David Lean would not exist in today's world so I recommend that movie lovers return to the modern classics. The recolouring of the films make them totally contemporary by photography standards.",10,0,1,18 October 2010
Behind The Candelabra," A great movie of a Fifties icon!
","Douglas must at least be nominated for an Academy award for this one because he, at least to Diane and I, slipped seamlessly into his character as Liberace, the masterful entertainer that filled the TV screens during those early days of TV in the Fifties. Hollywood really got it right when they decided to take the book written by Daemon's character and converted his insights into the life of this great entertainer into what became this masterful look into Liberace's life. Thorson, the author as well as the second character in the movie, wrote what seems to be a very fair portrait of himself and Liberace, warts and all.I remember listening to Liberace's TV shows as a kid during the Fifties and not really caring for much of anything about him: his demeanor, his dress nor his music. He did not need me in his audience though; obviously the blue rinse set were his fans and he was exceptionally good at giving them what they wanted, glitz and talented piano playing.Isn't it interesting that certain very talented people appear on the scene at critical times and had it happened later or earlier that talent would have gone unrecognized? It is sad to see people with huge amounts of talent but they appear at the wrong time; Liberace didn't!",8,3,5,5 August 2013
Call Me by Your Name," Be prepared for a film longer than Hollywood kids expect but it is well worth it
","Diane and I saw this gorgeous film in Fremantle this afternoon, and we both thought highly of the movie: I think my highly out vaulted her highly.Be prepared: the film is quite long; the various pieces of the script take time to fall into place meaning that the completed movie is like one of those one thousand piece jigsaw puzzles that seem too complicated at the beginning but are hugely compelling when finished.Please don't get me wrong the film is not an Agatha Christie mystery; however, it does contain many pieces that need to be carefully joined: parents and son, girlfriend and son, lover and another girlfriend. The viewer will quickly fit them together, but they do require patience as the movie will be considered slow-moving by contemporary standards.My recommendation is to make every effort to see this film; however, don't bother if you are homophobic or do not want to see female breasts on the movie screen. Other than those caveats it is a brilliant film.",10,1,10,28 December 2017
Gran Torino," It is hard to criticize an icon.
","I grew up with Eastwood and I am a great admirer of his directing and his acting.Â  Having said this I feel, however, like the guy that reads a review of a great restaurant and goes there expecting a fabulous meal but walks out afterward feeling letdown.Â  There wasÂ  a feeling of dÃ©jÃ  vue about this filmÂthat I had seen the film before with the same characters, same (roughly) storyline and the same protagonist going through pretty much the same actions.I did not feel like I had entered the presence of a great director as I have felt in the past with other Greats and their films because the hallmarks of those directors, those readily identifiable techniques that clearly demonstrate the hand of a master,Â  did not appear in this film.Â  I did not appreciate the script; I was not happy to see the straw dog of Eastwood's irascible character slowly come to grips with the ethnic changes in his neighbourhood and have the entire storyline based upon the seemingly inevitable opinion conversion that took place.Â  The movie did not strike me as something I would like to see but friends said that it was good and worthwhileÂ  watching; however, after all is said and done, I believe my initial opinion was justified.",7,2,7,20 February 2009
Hero," Extraordinary images!
","I admit that I am unfamiliar with the genre of martial arts films and therefore probably missed many points that would be recognized by enthusiasts of these, primarily, Asian films. Having said that, I was totally mesmerized by the beauty of this amazing film that I watched this afternoon. I tend to judge films more on the quality of the visuals that I see rather than other major aspects of film so this was a visual feast of virtually unmatched beauty. At the beginning of the film is the opening fight scene-shot in dark greys in the rain[!] and I was totally hooked after that. The beauty of Zhang's shot selection and Doyle's photography made those first minutes the worth of the film-the remainder was just cake frosting for me. I don't think that I will ever see a scene more beautifully composed and filmed for the rest of my years. Later on the fight scene with Maggie Cheug with the screen filled with the yellow leaves of autumn was nearly as beautiful.Zhang's choice of billowing robes for the costumes in the martial scenes left an otherworldly aspect to what, under another director, would have been a standard fight scene fueled by the martial activity; his direction took the scene into another realm-one unanticipated by this viewer with the result being memorable.A fabulous film that I will anticipate viewing a second and third time-the BEST!",Null,1,2,7 November 2004
The Hurt Locker," More Iraq War than I ever want to see.
","I found this to be a very disturbing film because there were many references to the fact that some of the soldiers felt they should not be there and that it wasn't their war; the morale of the soldiers were at odds. I have no interest in the debacle of the Bush/Cheney war fostered on the American people so the question is legitimately asked, Why then did you go? The film, if it did not explore, at least it approached these questions. I found The Hurt Locker to be a memorable film in that there were scenes that will last a long time in the recesses of my poor mind; even now, some days after we attended, I can still see some of the hard scenes that composed much of the film. The ending where the explosives soldier knew that he had to return to Iraq, not because of patriotism but simply that his dangerous bomb disposal work had turned him into a danger junkie, like people that participate in dangerous sports. As I wrote at the beginning of this comment, 'a very disturbing film'. The Hurt Locker was an interestingly constructed film in that it was composed of pieces with, to me, little holding those pieces together. I saw numbingly dangerous incidents with little connective tissue; the film was very episodic, with those episodes of danger the substance of the film. I guess I ultimately found that manner of film making disturbing in that I wanted to see more of a film constructed like An Education, also up for Best Picture. But I did not make the film and I get mad at commentators who criticize a film because the film is not the way they think that it should have been made. The Hurt Locker throws light on an aspect of war that few of us would consider and yet, arguably, hidden bombs are the devices that cause the most hurt to western forces in Iraq and we, the observers, know little about this terrible aspect of modern warfare.",9,2,7,12 March 2010
Moulin Rouge!," truly bad!
","It is my habit to refrain from commenting on movies that are not to my taste because it is not fair to the product to slang it just because it doesn't appeal to you; however, in the case of Moulin Rouge I'll make an exception.Baz Luhrmann got it wrong-wrong from the very opening right to the end.  His movie was a pistache of bits put together leaving me wondering why I'm bothering to watch this story that seems to be going in so many directions. The movie was very jerky-lunging from scene to scene with little thought as to establishing any connectionsI love Australian movies and the vision they present of the world but Luhrmann's vision was too disjointed for my taste.",1,14,25,16 June 2001
Lincoln," When Hollywood gets it right, you have a 'Lincoln'
","Wow, that's what both of us said when regaining our speech after viewing this great film yesterday. I had seriously lost all hope that Hollywood could produce a serious film: a film like other nations seem to turn out with aplomb. But they caught me out yesterday with this marvelous movie that had no bloodshed, no violence of any kind, no talking animals or human figures that mouthed the lines of well known accents. No, this was a serious movie that required some modicum of grey-matter to follow all that was happening as well as a certain amount of old fashioned schoolbook knowledge. On all these accounts a definitely un-American movie. If J. Edgar were around he would have brought all the major players before the House Un-American Activities Committee for reasons that only he could fathom.I believe, and rightly so, that all the major actors should win Academy Awards: Day-Lewis, Field and Jones. They are simply the standouts but there was not a weak actor in the entire movie. My personal favourite was Tommy Lee Jones but that is only preference. Spielberg should win as director because he brought this bunch together and moulded (I know, I knowâit is a trite word but...) the cast into something beyond what it could/should have been.I thought also that the screenplay was tremendous; the Set Decoration was truly marvelous and the lightingâthe lighting, how do you recreate that felling of muted light that would have been the norm at that time? Everything about the film was magical; it is a must-see movie!",10,4,7,12 February 2013
The Imitation Game," Marvelous history as well as a mavellous period piece
","Diane and watched this lovely film this past Monday, three days ago. Both of us left the theater with the same thoughts about the excellence of the film we had just seen: the acting by all characters was award winning as were the sets and the photography. The script was balanced between genuine tension regarding the next moves by the main actor and the surrounding players.Having just read one of the comments about this marvelous film and not knowing the details surrounding this extraordinary breakthrough in cipher history particularly as it pertains to the Second World War, I must agree with his superior knowledge. I can only comment on this movie which, as I have mentioned, was totally absorbing for Diane and I. I can, on the basis of what we saw the other day, think that this is a sleeper of a movie that has not garnered the accolades that we believe it justly deserves. By all means see this film if you have the chance and judge for yourself if the actors as well as the other aspects of the film do not deserve greater credit that it has so far received?",9,2,8,31 January 2015
Blood Diamond," Human beings have much to answer for!
","The horror of this wonderful movie leaves one speechless; it is hard to comment on a movie such as Blood Diamond because the awful truth of our miserable existence comes flooding back rendering an intelligent response almost impossible.I know political comments about movies must be framed extremely carefully but what I saw several days ago makes me want to explore ideas that probably should be left for a bar or BBQ. How do you deal with boy soldiers shooting prisoners blindfolded or hacking off the hands of people on the other side from the adults that use these boy-soldiers until they are used up or dead? Of course, you enter the theater knowing the outline of the story but then you must face the movie-facts of the real story that can be seen at night on the evening news--if your news will deal with it.Like one of the African characters famously says in the movie, 'Its a good thing we don't have oil' and doesn't that comment pierce the heart of the matter--their raw materials and western greed.The cast was uniformly excellent. Connelly was perfect as the correspondent who knows the horror but also knows the hurdles in trying to get the story out to an ambivalent western world. DiCaprio plays the best role of his career to date. I find it laughable when people say an actor failed to maintain an accent through the entire movie. He went into and out of a white southern African accent; I don't care, it is enough that he tried, that it wasn't totally American and that his portrayal of a jaded diamond trader was a pleasure to watch.And last, the brilliant acting of Hounsou whose strength through the horror of his reality in Sierra Leone deserves the Academy for which he is nominated. He is a superb actor and I am sorry that he is offered roles of African men caught in this seemingly never ending story of African reactions to western greed.Make an effort to see such a great contemporary tale--you will not be sorry.",10,6,9,30 January 2007
The World's Fastest Indian," One of the very best movies I have ever seen!
","I was gob smacked by this movie. As many others have commented, I had no idea what I was going to see at the theater yesterday when Diane and I entered. After sitting through the usual slocky Disney trailers and assorted other forget-quickies, this unknown movie came on and within minutes both of us were totally hooked and remained that way for the entire length of the film. I am completely soft when it comes to emotions but even I was surprised by the emotions Doaldson wrung out of this film: elation, sadness, suspense-in short, the full gamut of things that nibble at the heart and bring tears to the eyes.I am unfamiliar with Donaldson's work but this fabulous film has cemented his movie making skills firmly in my memory-I will anxiously anticipate any new film with which he is connected-I also loved his script! Last night I read all the comments for this movie and I thought the Kiwi ones were particularly good. The guy from Dunedan who was impressed by Anthony Hopkins ability to imitate the south island's unusual, vaguely Scotish accent and the other commentator who observed how Hopkins had avoided the all to frequently made mistake of using an Australian rather than New Zealand accent.The commentators praise for Hopkins was more than justified-he embodied Burt Munro as much as a viewer unconnected with the actual people could judge. Again commentators have written that the Munro's family left the theater with tear filled eyes-a true comment about Hopkin's portrayal of Munro.The movie was a story based on fact but nonetheless a story. People have criticised the scenes in American with the 'cardboard' characters but I found them fascinating and having experience in the States I know that those characters play the exact roles that Donaldson gave them. I have encountered at different times virtually all those characters in nearly the same places as was depicted. To say they were cut-outs trivializes their existence and shows the superficiality of the observer.To sum up, the movie is as great as so many people have said. It is a peon to the cinematic craft!",10,0,0,17 May 2006
Selma," Memories as scary as they were when they fist appeared on TV.
","Diane and I saw this marvelous film yesterday in Fremantle and both of us were moved by the images of those now long ago years. She did not think as highly of the film as I did; she thought it was a bit 'cheesy' but I on the other hand thought that all that I saw on the screen dovetailed perfectly with my memories of TV news watching of those years ago; I enjoyed every moment of this 'return.'I thought that the casting and the makeup people did a superb job: Andrew Young looked as he did and Ralph Abernathy looked as I remember him. Diane did not think that Johnson looked as she remembered but his thinning hair was a dead giveaway. Coretta King was, again, unmistakable. Some of the other, George Wallace for instance, needed the surrounds of history to bring him into focus but those are minor points considering the huge scale of personalities that peppered the playing field of those tumultuous years.I have not mentioned the figure of Martin Luther King who appeared, virtually, in every scene of the film. His appearance was captured very well but who besides King could deliver those almost melodious speeches that we all know: the most perfect speeches ever to be heard by human beings and not one but literally dozens of them.I was literally frightened by the scenes of the film even though I knew what would happen from memories of TV broadcasts in the early Sixties; the gut wrenching thump of the police batons could make you sick and just emphasized the courage of the white Freedom Marchers and the Black Freedom Marchers who faced those batons in the name of Nonviolence only armed with the weapon of courage. See this film even if you think you have heard enough of those people and events.",10,1,2,7 February 2015
Invictus," Political genius!
","Diane and I were both moved by all that we saw during Invictus. I congratulate Eastwood for attempting, what to me, was an unlikely story in that rugby is a sport that few Americans know anything about although it is hugely important here in Australia as well as in New Zealand just across the Tasman. To select a film about a man who is truly the savior of his country and then form the story around an international game was a tremendous gamble but because of Eastwood's command of the film art form, the movie was an amazing visual, emotional and intellectual package. The story of Nelson Mandela is in and of itself easily one of the greatest stories of humanity in and then to wrap that story around something as unlikely as South Africa's participation in a World Cup rugby game speaks volumes about the director's competence as well as that of the script writer, the actors and the original novel from which the story was taken. Very early in the film you are struck by Mandela's political genius; we in the modern world are unused to seeing a person so sensitive to the needs of his country that he can rise above his own needs. We are unused to a person that is so sensitive to the greater movements around him that he can act for that greater need. When you remember that Mandela spent 16 years of his life in prison making little rocks out of big rocks then the enormity of this man's genius is almost beyond comprehension. When he sees what needs to be done and then goes through the motions of trying to make people who can only, because their mind is not equal to his, see their private histories rather than his embracing human view then one is involved in the tension of all that has been reduced to one game of rugby. This movie is transcending and must be watched.",10,2,4,14 February 2010
Woman in Gold," Brings reality to a strange historical episode
","Diane and I watched this superb film last night on CD; we both thought that it was meaningful and brought an interesting perspective on a situation that we knew about but had not seen it take shape as a film. This film brought substance to situations large and small that confront people on both sides of the political/social spectrum. Even the two of us living on the edge of the cultural world, have heard stories of the concern felt by people inhabiting dwellings throughout Western Europe who see cars moving slowly past their homes wondering if they lived in the home previously owned by Jews; the people in the car were their relatives and perhaps wanted it back. There are a huge number of stories that revolve around these circumstances, not just concerning houses but artefacts such as this movie define so well.This was a true story involving a very famous painting and the role played by Mirren and Reynolds was virtually perfect. Her role was enacted superbly in that she conveyed that anguish of not: wanting to return to Vienna, wishing to force an issue regarding the ownership of the painting and confronting old memories that had long-since been mentally buried. The script revolves around her attempt to access the painting and as such she is involved in myriad court cases in America as well as Austria. Reynolds is the lawyer that handles her case; the film also revolves around the legalism of her attempts to regain the picture. Therefore, the film has these two sides: the legal and the emotional/historic.I believe the Director did a marvellous job of taking the plot back to the original characters, as of 1938, when Anschluss joined Hitler's Germany to Austria. It was a very good technique in that the viewer could get some idea of the time period when all of this activity took place. Everything about this film is without error and extremely timely and therefore should be sought out and viewed.",10,2,4,2 May 2016
The Da Vinci Code," Who would have thought-a mystery thriller about historical religion!
","I just left this wonderful film and want to put my unadulterated thoughts on paper-having purposely not read any viewer comments on IMDb. I probably am one of the few in the western world who have not read The Da Vinci Code so I am writing purely about the film I just watched. Earlier in the week I saw another superb movie, The World's Fastest Indian and it too was brilliant but for enormously different reasons-it was kinda like comparing Titian to Picasso-both brilliant painters but having little in common other than the paint on the canvas.Ron Howard directed a superlative action movie: fast paced, doors that open onto unexpected tangents with unexpected characters, historical depth and unusual motivations. In short, I found the movie a first rate thriller with huge depth and wonderful acting. Ron Howard brought out the best in Hanks, Tautou and especially Ian McKeller. I enjoy visual movies greatly and I thought that Howard used the camera to its very best. There was much camera movement and interesting useful flashbacks at points needing further elaboration.The visual beauty of the film was enhanced by Salvatore Tortino's beautiful camera work as cinematographer. For some reason, on this film, I noticed the blurred backgrounds of the many closeups called for by Howard-really startlingly beautiful closeups of big shots of people.Religious extremists will be outraged by the underlying philosophy of this movie but that philosophy plays a small part in the movie. From an anti-religion person like myself, The Da Vinci Code was an excellent mystery/thriller made wonderfully delicious by its subject matter-a two thousand year old mystery.Now I will read the novel and then go to the movie at least one more time. I have been a critic of American movies in the past, and from today's previews before The ...Code I will remain so, but this film is the exception that proves the rule. Watching, The ...Code was a great experience and I recommend it to everyone except religious extremists.This morning I sat through The Code again and enjoyed it far more than I did the first time two weeks ago. I enjoyed: Howard's direction even more; I thought his camera angles and shot selection perfectly suited the film; I enjoyed the acting more than at my first screening; I was very impressed with the editing and was most impressed by the script writing after having read the book in the intervening weeks.All concerned should be extremely proud of their efforts!",10,5,11,19 May 2006
The Shape of Water," Take it from a SciFi sceptic this is a brilliant film that should be seen.
","Diane and I saw this marvellous film in Fremantle yesterday and although I am not a SciFi buff in reading nor in visual media I thought the movie was brilliant in all respects.
The ability of the film to transcend reality was remarkable; the script was, and resulting screenplay made the unreal real such that the sceptical viewer like myself sat there engrossed in what should be laughable, but everyone concerned made it so reasonable that, '...of course these things can happen.' As a SciFi sceptic, this theme has got to be the bolt that holds the entire concept together otherwise the film turns into a comedy. Unfortunately, I have sat through a number of those, and they have not been pleasant.
All of this film works: the acting is superb as are the many other segments that keep an outrageously good movie like this assembling accolades from around the world. Miss it at your own regret.",Null,19,37,19 January 2018
Enemy at the Gates," The best war movie I've ever watched!
","All future war films that I watch will be forced through the sieve of Enemy at the Gates and I will be surprised if anything from America will even remotely touch the power of this film.I freely admit that I know nothing about the production except that it could not possibly have been made with American money-too many foreigners acting, too few swipes at the Russians and far too many positive comments about the hated Soviets.The opening war shots of the barges across the river ferrying fresh troops to the besieged Stalingrad was as harrowing as any war sequence that I've ever seen and to think that the reality of the Stalingrad meat grinder was vastly worse gives you chills-the landing on the shore with its inevitable battles shows reasons for the revolvers that officers carry.The second, but major section of the script, with the development of the mini-war between the German sent to Stallingrad to kill the now famous young Russian sniper provides as good a background for the remainder of the film as is possible to see in a cinema.  The drama of the characters trying to play out some semblance of reality against the horrors of Stalingrad would tax the best of the best and the entire cast and crew deserve the highest accolades for their success in bringing this amazing story to the cinema.If you, as I did, miss this movie in the theatre then make every effort to rent it on video-it is brilliant!",10,7,12,4 May 2003
American Made," Hollywood finally gets it right
","When Hollywood gets it right and stops making movies for children they can actually make a beauty like this one. My wife and I just returned from such an accomplished film some minutes ago: American Made. We have seen Tom Cruise in a number of his previous films (not necessarily by choice) and both of us kind of cringed at his screen presence. He delivered his lines well enough, but we did not see him as a genuine character; he seemed always to be playing his roles rather than living them. The exception was the movie we attended this afternoon; Cruise 'stepped into the role', he became Barry Seal and us, the audience lived his demise with him from airline pilot to cocaine courier to arms smuggler for the American government.This movie could not have been made while Ron Reagan was alive and the other principles like Ollie North sat in positions of decision-making power close to the Oval Office. This movie was about Barry Seal, Drug Smuggler and tangentially about the evil and stupidity that lurked in the minds of people that ran the American government and caused the deaths of many thousands of people in Central America.This is a brave and thoughtful film that all lovers of America should see; besides its political strength see it because of it is a high film making aptitude.",10,23,41,12 September 2017
Crazy Heart," America does not look good up close.
","D and I saw the film this afternoon and both of us, over a meal later, had roughly the same conclusions about it: we both thought that it was a tough movie and that the characters were sharply drawn and well executed. We both thought that Bridges deserved his awards for an extremely well acted role. Our only difference was that I thought the first 2/3rds was a hard watch and she thought the last third was the harder to watch. If you see the film you will know exactly of what we speak. Having lived in the States and having traveled its roads, I found the watching uncomfortable; I've seen those bars, those towns and those bowling alleys and although filmed and portrayed well, they were too well to be comfortable. I have seen Bad in his many forms and none of them are remotely pretty. The male/female relationships in this film are too numbing to handle; it's like the song says, 'Lookin' for love in all the wrong places'. I can't really buy the press release , 'The Harder The Life, The Sweeter The Music; the old saw about making a silk purse out of a sow's ear comes to mind. However, these thoughts are about the subject of the movie not about the movie itself; we are morphing into existential thought here and those thoughts are a factor of just how good this film was in that it brings out thoughts extraneous to the actual film. That, in my opinion, is the highest compliment that can be paid a film.",9,2,3,24 March 2010
Downfall," Perhaps the strangest way any war has ended.
","I have seen docos and read of these strange last days of the Third Reich. This movie recounted those facts but was so much more than a history lesson-which is what it was with the extra dimension of human drama that could not be dealt with by a documentary.The two plus hours of this engrossing film passed swiftly after entangling me in the extraordinarily fine acting, cinematography and lighting of the talented people that produced such a great film. I mention the lighting artistry because 99% of this film takes place in Hitler's bunker in the final days of the war; therefore, the constraints of shooting indoors would have taxed these guys to the max and their result was perfect.The script writers, Bernd and Eichinger, took the memoir's of Hitler's secretary and shaped them into a movie of excellence and are to be congratulated.Magda Goebbels must be one of the ultimate characters in European history and Carinna Harfouh played her beyond great-something that only the best of the best could carry off. A mother that commits the gravity of the acts that she committed in those last hours in the bunker warrants more notoriety than she has. I believe people should see the movie just to watch Harfouh's acting-it is a tour de force! This is not to take anything from Ulrich Mathes who played her husband, Joeseph Goebbels, who viewers can always identify because he is the only one in that brown uniform amongst a sea of Nazi army uniforms.A final word must be said of the killings in the film and the decisions that accompanied them-these killings, beyond the executions for what the remaining officers believed was desertion, were suicides by the men and women remaining in the bunker. Execution for some suicide for others because, as Magda Goebbels said, 'I cannot live without National Socialism'. It is scary that some people can feel so strongly about a cause.",10,2,5,18 April 2005
The Wolf of Wall Street," Don't look for the dirt beneath the carpet you might find a mirror
","Diane and I saw this film several days ago and I immediately wanted to see it again; she, on the other hand, could not allow herself to see it again. We both discussed the film later but she said that she did not have the stomach to see it again because although she was far beyond being naive enough to disbelieve what was on the screen, she was not prepared to watch the bottom-hugging activities of the film. I too was not surprised by anything that I saw on the screen however, I just wanted to see the parts that I probably missed the first time; although the film is about three hours long, it moves so quickly that it would easy, at least for me, to miss not only the dialogue but some of the visuals.I have nothing but praise for the acting, the script, the direction and the set direction; I saw nothing in the film to criticise. The enormity of the evil played before our eyes was nothing less than staggering. It would be easy to say that the film exaggerated the events but the limited amount of time I have spent socializing with business people leads me to believe that the events in the film could easily happen given the people making the decisions.The old saying, business is business and nothing personal meant can be blown up into the visuals on the screen. Once a person believes that screwing another person is just how business is conducted then it takes little imagination to see how that mental palate can be adjusted to the extent that virtually anything can be allowed. This is a hugely damning movie for any business that works on the premise that 'business is business.'",10,4,10,3 February 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Extraordinarily dumb doctor but a superbly acted movie.
","A more richly deserved British acting award has never been given. These acting awards were announced here in Fremantle several nights ago before I had watched the movie for which Forrest Whitaker was given this Best Actor award. Diane and I attended The Last King of Scotland this morning and we were both absolutely in agreement that Mr. Witaker's performance, dare I use the often repeated accolade of electrifying, was just that! He was totally believable in the role of Idi Amin with all of Amin's quixotic behaviors and mercurial mood changes. I only remember Amin's physicality on TV broadcasts of the early 70's, I knew nothing of his personality or behavior but I am equally sure that Giles Foden's novel upon which Morgan and Brock's screen play was based was as accurate as the movie reviewers report.I know that commentators should not necessarily make personal comments about the players in this shoddy little drama played out in central Africa 25 or so years ago but the most memorable aspect of this remarkable movie was not the Amin portrayal, as good as it was but the doctor's, as played by James McAvoy. I left the movie with the good doctors utter, absolute stupidity clouding my memory of this film. Being overly friendly with his medical partners wife was dumb enough, trying to kill Amin with a poison pill was disastrous for one's health but having a sexual affair with one of Amin's wive's was the ultimate stupidity. I know that the script of the movie was based on a fictional novel but the little notice at the film's beginning saying that the movie was factually based leaves a certain questioning in the back of my mind.Even if the script were totally fictional regarding the good doctor, I still must question a script with such exceedingly stupid people. Amin emerges as a paradigm of virtue and reasonableness in comparison to his doctoral confidant.These are just silly random comments about a wonderful movie peopled with extraordinary good actors. Amin's henchmen that do the dirty on the doctor at movie's end are memorably sinister--just looking at those guys is scary without them even doing anything. The Last King of Scotland is a memorable movie, miss it and you will have missed a truly great movie.",10,4,6,14 February 2007
The Reader," A movie of profound moral dilemmas!
","Diane and I watched this moving, confronting film yesterday and we both felt its disturbing combination of innocent guilt (can there be such a contradiction of terms?) and commonplace evil. So much is illuminated in the last part of the film; so many questions answered and so many moral issues raised during the film's trial that a person like myself left the theatre with fascinating moral dilemmas jumping over each other and made The Reader an extremely satisfying viewing experience. To me, the most memorable scene took place at the trial when the prosecutor asked Hanna (Kate Winslet) why she did not open the door of the burning church when she knew that a fire was sweeping through the building. Hanna, when questioned by the trial judge and asked why she did such a thing, replied that it was the proper thing to do; that she was an SS guard and that to let the people out of the burning church would have meant chaos and as a guard she could not allow that to happen. Hannah Arendt perfectly described the moral situation that the Hanna of the movie found herself in and she described it as the banality of evil. To quote her, 'The sad truth is that most evil is done by people who never make up their minds to be good or evil' and isn't this precisely the situation that Hanna Schmitz found herself confronting? After this startling revelation, the viewer must deal with the confronting personal trauma faced by Fienne's character, Michael Berg; should he tell the court of Hanna's illiteracy (a personal problem she has lived with her entire life) or keep her secret and see her spend her adult life behind bars while her fellow SS guards continue their lie and escape justice?The Reader is an intellectual, severe movie that people should see without fail.",10,4,5,2 April 2009
Ray," An extraordinary must-see film!
","I attended this film reluctantly, not expecting to enjoy the viewing but wanting to accompany my wife to the movie of her choice. How wrong I was! Ray turned out to be one of the best Hollywood films I have ever seen and Jamie Foxx is one of the most deserving Academy Award winners of recent years. He was Ray Charles for the period of the film: he had mastered Ray's mannerisms, his speech patterns and became Ray Charles for the time of the film. I don't believe a greater accolade could be given an actor than to say that for the period of the film, the viewer lost sight of the unreality of that which they were watching-you became immersed in what was essentially 'reality TV' or documentary. The sense of viewing a movie was lost and to me there can be nothing greater said about a film than that the film loses totally that sense of movie unreality. When Hollywood gets it right, the result is sublime-a product unequaled anywhere in the world. The problem is-they miss far more often than they hit-Ray is the exception that proves this statement.Hackford's direction was as sublime as Foxxe's acting. As a rule, I am absorbed more by a film's visuals than I am by the acting or story; with Ray, however, I had to remind myself to pay attention to the camera work and the shot selection because the story and Foxx's remarkable portrayal continually pulled me away from the film's images. Hackford's use of flashbacks contributed to this, for me, unusual perception of the film. These flashbacks fleshed in segments of the script that would be difficult to stitch together without them.",10,0,2,1 March 2005
Murder on the Orient Express," Where else would you want to kill somÃ©body?
","Diane and I viewed this beauty of a film this afternoon, and we both thoroughly enjoyed a magical cinema event: I use these words because the movie takes you out of your own reality and places you in another world that is not macabre or dangerous but filled with beautiful people, costumes and settings. Perhaps the reader can tell that I love being removed from the mundanity of our ordinary existence. This beautifully constructed film filled with marvellous actors who are dressed in gorgeous timely costumes and set to work in spectacular train compartments and asked to use a perfect script will leave many cinema-goers anticipating more.If I were much younger, I would not hunger for the movies from the Directors Period in the 70s and 80s when they were allowed to make Great Movies rather than only the money-men. In any event, see this film for its sublime attractions painted by Kenneth Branagh.",10,148,312,9 November 2017
The Blind Side," Moving and strangely peaceful.
","Diane and I have just returned from this lovely film. Please, fellow commentators do not rag me about this film's lack of characterization, trite plot moves or done-to-death script lines and situations, I really understand all that high school English class criticism but I believe that we must move beyond puerile critiques of fundamentally good films that are enjoyable to watch. The Blind Side (and I have yet to read the negative comments) is heart-warming, gentle and very well acted by all concerned. There is room for movies like this one; movies that allow the audience a look into two hugely different lifestyles but interestingly seemed not to dwell on these variations. To me these massive differences formed a strange canvas upon which the film was painted but the substance of the film was elsewhere. I expected, after reading the movie fliers that Sandra Bullock's character, although telegraphed to do so, would not play her role in that way, that she would pass over these massive differences and not be at all troubled by them. She was from the Old South, she was a conservative (a Republican) and she was very well off. However, that is exactly what happened; she grew as a person during the film and she did genuinely, through meeting Michael Oher, saw parts of life that were unknown to her. Leigh Anne Tuohy's natural son, by Diane's judgment, stole every scene that he was in and I must agree. Everybody played their roles excellently well and we enjoyed their work to the max. I hope Sandra Bullock receives her much deserved Oscar for this role.",9,0,1,27 February 2010
The Water Diviner," A war movie that is not about war(?).
","As a migrant to Australia of many years I still cannot fathom the Australian patriotism that surfaces when national citing of Gallipoli is mentioned; as many people know it was a defeat packaged in that over- credited brain of the first lord of the admiralty: Winston Churchill. We all know that his use of Australian troops, among others, in an ill- founded attack at Gallipoli which strategically may have been reasonable but tactilely virtually impossible given where the Allied landing occurred.With this monumentally futile battle as the background a father returns to the actual battlefield after the war to find the bodies of his three sons who never returned to Australia and their parents. As I wrote at the beginning, this is a film about war but has a minimum of scenes of the warfare elements. It is a film about the search, definitely, but it is also about what he finds in that country so far away with people that are far away from his own parochial patch of farmland on the desert's edge in NSW.I thought the film was about discovery; the discovery of his missing sons and likewise the discovery, not so much about himself but about a larger world with vastly different people who have their own unique approach to life on this rock. It is a movie of joining and of the realization that we are far closer than the war leaders would like us to understand.",10,13,25,16 January 2015
Wonder Woman," Only if you really want to see it
","Yesterday afternoon, Diane and I attended a Hollywood remake of the old comic book hero, Wonder Woman. Diane and I, who usually agree on the worth of movies, thought very differently about this film.I admit at the very beginning of this comment that I am an old codger who dislikes modern Hollywood productions. Diane wanted to go because Hollywood broke their age-old pattern of making male centered movies so I accompanied her against my better judgment because I loathe popular 'blockbuster' movies and this turned out not to be an exception.I also admit to falling asleep during the first part where Wonder Woman is growing up but then saw the second half where she fights in the First World War. The last 2/3rds that I saw were pretty bad; the war scenes were typical 'god guys beating up the bad guys' that Hollywood seems unable to discard. I am sitting here shaking my head at those terrible war bits towards the completion of this bad movie. Please read the One Star comments because they said what I think except they write better than I and they remember the scenes far better than I.I thought Gal Gadot who played the mature Wonder Woman was either directed badly or could not act well because the faces she pulled during the scenes in England and particularly during the battle scenes in France were Beyond the Pale. Admittedly she had terrible scripted scenes to work with and the Director should never have kept all of her close-ups. You can forgive all of these complaints but you cannot all of the Hollywood German-bashing in the second half of the film.",3,12,30,24 June 2017
The Queen," A beguiling, absorbing film that I will long remember.
","As an avowed republican I was unsure, even knowing the many accolades the film has garnered, that I would have much interest in it. However my curiosity about Liz was too much for me and I looked forward to seeing the normal side of a public figure who I had grown up with. I didn't know much about her except the TV spots showing her with strange looking little purses hung on her arm and her undoubted love for Corgis. That the entire film was built around the week that Diana was killed in Paris took me a little by surprise but in terms of film building it made perfect sense.In my opinion, everything that has been said about Helen Mirren's performance is absolutely true. She embodied Elizabeth perfectly and she richly deserves even if she doesn't receive an Accademy for her performance. Having said that, I can not recall a single performance that was in any way mediocre. I was struck with how extraordinarily accurate the performances were. The casting was remarkable; every person from he Duke to Blair's offsiders were perfect.Regardless of your feelings about the Monarchy, remember Blaire's outburst at his staff towards the movie's end, this film should be seen: see it for its contemporary history, for the fabulous acting work, its brilliant casting as well as settings not normally seen.",10,1,1,21 January 2007
Any Given Sunday," Oliver Stone is a genius!
","If Oliver Stone had not made On Any Given Sunday, I don't think there is a director alive that could have made this film. As soon as the movie begins you realize that you are in the presence of a director that is beyond the realm of the ordinary because your senses are assaulted by extraordinary action, sounds that transport the viewer into the epicenter of mayhem and camera shots that I've never seen matched before. After leaving this film, virtually any other movie becomes mundane and ho-hum because the avalanche of on-screen action grabs you and holds you for the entire length of the movie.This is hard to say but even the wonderful acting of Pacino is over shadowed by the enormity of the directorial excellence.If you love Pacino, love football or love superb directing then you owe it to yourself to see this masterpiece.",Null,0,0,29 July 2000
La Vie En Rose," Whew-insightful, difficult and and almost too tough for me.
","It is rare that I knowingly attend movies as difficult as this film because I admit to being an emotional coward and La Vie En Rose was a difficult movie to sit through. Certainly not because it was in any way poorly made; the movie was, in my opinion, sad and immensely thought provoking. Beyond simply being a biography of a popular singer, Olivier Dahan's direction and script writing forced the viewer to examine the many social situations that impacted on this person's life from the beginning of her journey on this rock. The French, more than other nationalities, seem willing to look at the underbelly of their society through art and the artists that produce that art. With Piaf as a focal point, Dahan peels away the fluff of the existence of one of modern France's greatest artists and we are left with a world we know existed but is little examined because it leaves people asking uncomfortable social questions about why societies allow such degradation to take place in the midst of plenty. How can children grow with no education; why people busk for coins with little hope of a meal at night; why can't families stay together and the greater question, why do we allow it to continue over and over and over? Marion Cotillard acted beyond acting; the pathos she brought to the screen was almost too much. I am not privy to on-screen dying--real death, not the pretend that Hollywood is forced to film because some people do not like to watch reality. Cotillard's portrayal of Piaf's final days went beyond acting; it was as if she moved into another realm of reality. I almost felt like a voyeur watching death because the makeup people made Cotillard look so terribly death-like.Here in WA, the Film Editor of the local paper, Mark Naglazas, thought the film was brilliant except for the director's mishandling, in his view, of the juxtapositioning of the various stages of Piaf's life. I, on the other hand, thought that this movement forward and backward, gave a particularly insightful look at the traumatic episodes that Piaf passed through. I sat watching a wrenching life pass before me and I thought how well Dahan had written and directed the movie that I was watching.La Vie En Rose is a wrenching movie; a movie that looks under the carpet but a movie that does this examination so well that the viewer is left satisfied because of the quality but deeply moved and saddened by all that was just viewed.A must see film; film at its best!",10,2,5,2 August 2007
The Deer Hunter," A film masterpiece!
","I watched this magnificent film when it was first released and returned to it yesterday so many years later and I was stunned at its magnificence. I know nothing of film commentary so these viewpoints are only the ramblings of a person that saw a movie 30 years after he first watched it and was amazed that so much of film making has gone backwards.The controversy about Cimino and his box office failure, Heaven's Gate, must be the worst catastrophe that has ever struck American film. That miss meant that the world lost a director that saw film as an empty canvas upon which movies could be worked much as 20th century painters reworked painting in new styles. In Deer Hunter we can see Cimino rework film content much as he did in Heaven's Gate, to much less acceptance. Cimino did not create one movie but a series of movies roughly revolving around a centrepiece. He was not making a 'war movie'; rather, he was creating a pastiche of little movies with the same characters, much as he did in his hugely misunderstood Heaven's Gate.For many reasons Heaven's Gate misfired and today we must sit through movies that begin and end virtually in the same time-frame and with a vertically constructed story line. We do not have the great directors of the 70s and 80s to stretch the composition of film as Cimino and some of his compatriots did.Deer Hunter was Cimino's exploration of many of those themes that he was to develop in Heaven's Gate: the use of eastern Europeans as the matrix for the film, long scenes that many viewers saw as unnecessary, scenes crowded with people, long or medium shots rather than the current mania for massive closeups and movies within movies to mention only a few.People have commentated here that the Russian Roulett scene was a metaphor for America's catastrophe in Vietnam; however, I see it as a metaphor for growing up. The potential for disaster growing up in a little steel town is manifest; the only thing that saves your mind is being too young to recognise the dangers confronting you. It is as lucky to emerge from these little towns as it is to live through Russian Roulette and the odds might be worse.Deer Hunter is a massively thought provoking movie that can be enjoyed and milked for its insights many, many times.",10,0,1,2 July 2007
300," Hollywood comes to Thermopylae.
","I admit that I do not comment on movies that I have seen but do not like and this one is the exception that proves the rule. Diane and I watched this thing yesterday at a commercial megaplex and I am writing this comment because what I saw should not have been seen. As a general rule I love sword and sandal movies and do not even need to have seen nor read anything about the film to draw me in.My dabbling in ancient history is usually secure enough for me to judge a film's basic truth and this film , at least by my minimal standards, passed that minor test. However, it is not the historical fundamentals that put me off while I watched but the terrible Americanizm that blanketed the film in enough places to put me off entirely. I have not the slightest idea how Spartan soldiers acted before going into battle but I will wage my last dollar that they didn't give out simultaneous howls like a bunch of testosterone fueled Jarheads before laying waste to Mosul.Hollywood's take on ancient history always leaves room for humorous reflection. Remember Caesar's guard in Gladiator; remember how we knew they were the bad guys because they were dressed in black iodized armor--like a Roman version of the Nazi SS?I can put up with historical inaccuracy as long as it is not bathed in ridiculous 21st century Californian smell-nice.The whole thing was too goofy for me to remember and like Baz Loman's fin-de-siecle stinker Moulin Rouge, I feel that I must write , for my own peace of mind, a negative comment about 300.",4,8,14,28 April 2007
Gangs of New York," The underbelly of American history.
","After the initial fight scene ended leaving a patina of red blood soaked snow covering the area of this gang fight, my memory immediatelyreturned to Michael Cimino's masterpiece, Heaven's Gate.Thereafter throughout the film I kept thinking that I was looking at the reality of America's teenage years-the years that don't correspond to Cherry Blossoms, apple pie and all the other 'nice'  icons of the past in which America wants to wrap itself.The connections between the embedded violence that Michael Moore examined in Bowling for Columbine and the gestation of the violence examined by Scorsese in this film are far too strong to be ignored.This historical relationship of violence should be recognized and steps taken to eliminate such immaturity from a country that purports to be leader of the world.  I know this national examination will never take place but the threads connecting the past to the present must somehow be cut .",10,1,2,27 March 2003
Mad Max: Fury Road," A movie to nowhere: for the fans only.
","I hate watching movies that are not 10 or 9/10 but this was not much of my doing and it certainly lived up to any thoughts that I had about it before seeing it. That is not to say I watched the film with a head full of preconceived notions; no, I was ready to watch a film that was a valuable continuation of the superb Mad Max movie.I readily give credence where it is due with a film of such explosive force that simply does not stop until the very end. One need only look at the credits here on IMDb to see the creativity and work that went into this film but for me it was not enough. I could admire the work that went into creating the extraordinary cinematography but as for holding my interest it provided nothing beyond excellent makeup and action sequences. If that is what you want in a contemporary movie so be it. I am sorry I watched it though.",3,9,19,6 June 2015
Gladiator," Absorbing, but sadly flawed
","I found the movie a totally absorbing experience; the impact of Ridley Scott's direction was masterful and yet I left the cinema sadly unsatisfied-as if I instinctively felt that the genius-direction had passed over Gladiator but had not rested, leaving the product more commercial than great.Professionally I know a reasonable amount about the period of Roman history and excepting a few parts where cinematic license was indulged, the movie could be taken as accurate.I don't think that any actor could do more justice to the lead role than Russell Crowe; his brooding presence matches the enormity of the script's inevitable outcome.The film is definitely worth watching.",Null,0,0,5 May 2000
