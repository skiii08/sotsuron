Blade Runner 2049," Truly awful
","Terrible acting, half the film has nothing going on and could be easily edited out (it's 3 hours long), ad placements everywhere, twists revealed 3 times before it happens, horrible misplaced emotions from the actors - nearly every line of dialogue from the main characters falls flat and completely misses, a nonsense plot that is both dreadfully boring and hard to understand.This is a total disaster of storytelling, world building, character building, cohesion, and visual effects also look obviously fake and rendered - this is 2013 level stuff. A film for nostalgic nerds, and people who are smoking way too much. Not enjoyable as an actual movie.",1,3,5,6 January 2018
Pacific Rim," Garbage weaboo movie
","Awful cliche characters. Especially the helpless japanese misaku, struggling against her daddy issues with horrible english and creepy acting. White man saves the day.Amazing load of garbage.",1,2,3,8 February 2018
Jurassic Park," awful movie
","Annoying characters, useless dialogue, horrible acting.
I wondered why the newer Jurassic park movies were so mediocre but it turns out that each of the movies in this series is mediocre starting from the very first one.Apple doesn't fall far from the tree does it.",1,4,35,15 January 2018
