Antz," It's a spiffy film and damn anyone who says otherwise!
","Antz was a rather neat film, and there's no denying it. Bad language? Communist propaganda? *laugh* People are funny. 'Quit yer bitchin''? Oh no! Antz makes baby Jesus cry!Antz is a classic Woody Allen film, 'tis true, and I expect he had a bit of a hand in writing Z's script. The neat thing about the film, though, is that all of the characters are sterotypes of their voice actors. Imagine Stallone, Hackman or Walken as ants, and bingo!, that's how they are. Playing their perfect roles, they all do a sterling job, although Walken's character, Colonel Cutter, only has one real sinister 'Walkeny' scene, which is a shame.Animation is really a liberating medium, and they took good advantage of it. Visually the film is superb; the grand caverns are amazing, and a traditionally difficult piece of animation, water, is done really well. I was impressed. The sound was great, with a fantastic score - and NO, this isn't a Disney film (it was made by Dreamworks SKG), so the ants do not sing, thank the stars.All up, Dreamworks have made a fine animated comedy. It's not a film for kids - just because it's animated doesn't mean it has to be aimed at small children/christians; it's only a little less sophisticated than an ordinary Woody Allen film (whatever that means). There's no swearing at all, and no ant sex (although there are frequent ant births!), even still the relationships and social commentary are just enough to amuse a thinking person.Go see Antz. Antz good.",Null,0,0,30 October 1998
The Patriot," Patriot, how shall I describe thee?
","I just sat through the Patriot, to my everlasting regret. The movie was tedious, predictable, shallow and cheaply sentimental. It was the epitome of big-budget Hollywood cheese. It features a pathetically evil Englishman, who does everything short of eating roasted American babies (on screen - it's implied he does it off screen) who provides a convenient excuse for Mel Gibson to commit gratuitous acts of violence, interspersed with scenes of the American flag snapping cheerily in the breeze.Please listen to me. If you are like me, and you think Dr Strangelove is a better movie than the Matrix, The Seven Samurai is better than Lethal Weapon, or The Big Lebowski is better than Mission Impossible 2, avoid this jingoistic piece of garbage. If the converse is true, then by all means, pop a big bowl o' popcorn and get set for a 'roller coaster ride' that will have you 'on the edge of your seat.'",4,2,4,27 October 2000
Spider-Man," One more churned out by the popcorn mill
","Rarely do I feel as misanthropic as I do when I get home from a movie as bad as this one, and as popular as this one. Sure, it will fade by morning, but until then my dreams will be haunted be the ludicrous villainy, predictable action and motherhood-and-apple-pie cheese of Spider-Man. While Tobey MacGuire was an excellent choice, the whole movie was just lurching through the motions; there were no surprises, the whole thing felt paper-thin. Many cliches were strung together to lengthen the otherwise trivially simple plot - geek getting his own back against high-school bully, agonizing death scenes, and much puppy-dog romance which everyone else seems to have found adorable. I found it simply tedious. While the movie had some nice effects, it is, as one might expect, just another entry in a sad list of superhero flicks that are more or less indistinguishable from one another. Let me give you a hint: the good guy wins.",3,1,1,27 May 2002
Life Is Beautiful," An interesting movie about a complicated subject
","I think I must be in the very small majority of people that neither loved nor hated this movie. In many ways it was skillfully made and well acted. However, the first half of the movie felt like a wacky romantic comedy with an Italian slant. The second half of the movie, however, is set in (of all places) a Nazi death camp. I happen to believe that if you're going to set a movie in the midst of one of the most terrible parts of history, you want to have something say and to do it very carefully. This movie fails in this, I feel. The message of the movie is very trite: 'The human spirit can triumph over any adversity' might be a good summary. Rather than being uplifting, though, I found the implausible caperings of Guido and the credulity of his son to be ghoulish and disturbing in a way I doubt was intended by the filmmakers. I'm afraid I can't go along with the premise that the horror of Auschwitz could be covered up with some clever lies and a silly walk.However, I must stress that the movie is artfully made and contains some memorable scenes. The mountain of corpses in the mist was almost as creepy as Guido's final conversation with his friend, the good Doktor Lessing.La Vite e Bella is certainly worth a look; it is, however, neither profound nor historically valuable.",7,2,4,20 November 1999
The Matrix," Bah Humbug, I say!
","I have to wonder about the point of these here pico-reviews, since obviously they are skewed towards the kind of people who loved the film enough to take the trouble. Well, I didn't like it, and here's why.The profound matter of 'what is reality?', supposedly the film's underlying theme, is rather superficially treated. Don't expect your mind to be blown unless the thought 'reality is just the way we interpret electrical signals in our brain' is bizarre and new to you.Keanu has been given the thumbs up for playing a dazed and confused character so well - I kind of agree, except playing a dazed character is neither interesting or challenging. The lead character in this film is dull as dishwater, Hugo Weaving's Agent definitely steals the show. Fishburn was quite cool, although the way his character was set up I was a bit disappointed he was actually a tall black dude with sunglasses (exactly like you'd expect) and not an old Vietnamese woman with arthritis, which would really surprise you.However, my main issue is with the film's plot - it has plot holes so large Hannibal could drive his army through them. The future portrayed is mind-numbingly unoriginal, and the rationale for the existence of the Matrix itself is simply laughable; it's just patently ridiculous. (I feel so dirty.) The way in which the characters interact with 'reality' and 'the Matrix' is necessary to drive the plot, which I might liken to a new volvo; shiny and with computers in it, but still the same old boring car as they made 10 or 20 years ago. This interaction is, alas, stupid and nonsensical. Suspension of disbelief is easy to achieve in a movie with great acting or plot, but here, I tried and failed.On the up side, the combat sequences were amusing, the effects were OK - quite average for 1999, which is to say, pretty amazing. Weaving and his cohorts were cool, and until you actually find out what is going on, the plot is somewhat intriguing.This film is a Hollywood-made, Keanu Reeves-starring cyberpunk movie. You get what you expect - as long as you haven't read the other reviews. :)",7,0,0,13 April 1999
Gladiator," A great action movie, though not a great movie
","Well oil me up and call me a Roman, Gladiator was a most enjoyable action movie. The plot was actually non-trivial, Russell Crowe had a wonderful screen presence, and the violent action scenes we well shot and were genuinely exciting.However, don't mistake this movie for Great Cinema. It isn't. This is a Hollywood-spawned crowd-pleaser, a 'Roller coaster of a movie' that will 'have you on the edge of your seat.' While the plot was non-trivial as I said, it had few surprises and is not particularly interesting, though it did its job of wrapping the action scenes extremely well. The characters also do their jobs; unfortunately, without much flair. I would rate the thinness of the characters as this movie's worst flaw; the bad guy is wholly bad (they even make him a sexual deviant to drive the point home). The good guy is wholly good - plenty of reinforcing the 'loves his family' angle to show what a wholesome fellow he is. The other slaves are eloquent, good-natured, stoic, and dignified. If you were sold into slavery, beaten, starved and then told to be hacked into little pieces for the amusement of others, would you be so likeable? Me neither. The wise emperor, the faithful servant, and anyone else you care to name, are cardboard cutouts.
So, don't miss this one at the cinema. A most pleasing way to while away a couple of hours. I just wouldn't expect to see anyone quoting it in a year's time.",7,0,0,10 May 2000
