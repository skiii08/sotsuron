The Ring," Disappointing
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*I was expecting better from a movie hypes as the 'scariest of 2002'. I found The Ring to be drawn out and much too slow paced. Too much time is devoted to the investigation into the origins of video. This leads to resolution of sorts at the end, but creates too many dead end sub-plots and plot holes in the process. Overall the suspense just wasn't there. The freakiest moments of the film are delivered at the end, but by then I was left feeling cheated that at 116 minutes running time I had only seen 10 minutes that were remotely scary. The DVD edition contains an imaginative presentation of what appears to be deleted and alternate scenes from the movie. To me, it was more enjoyable than the actual movie. All in all, I found that The Ring failed to deliver on it's promises. Maybe it's just because of all the hype... 4/10* A fun little prank to play if you are watching this movie with other people: If you have a cell phone, near the end of the movie discreetly cue up the phone number of the place you are watching the movie at without removing the phone from your pocket. When the credits are rolling, call the number (again, without removing the phone from your pocket). This should elicit a bit of fear, especially in younger viewers. Heh heh heh.",4,0,1,10 March 2003
Memento," Great movie that requires some thinking
","I thought Memento was a wonderful, thought-provoking movie.  The end-to-beginning storytelling style was very interesting, though it was a challenge to get used to it.  After the first half hour it starts to make sense though.  Still, it is not a movie you can just passively watch; it does take some effort on the part of the viewer to understand what is happening.Some have criticized this film as having glaring plot holes.  I disagree. Leonard's problem is not what it seems and the answers to many of these 'plot holes' are right there in the film.  Watching this film once is not enough.  Much like 'Sixth Sense', the true enjoyment is in watching it again and seeing how all the pieces fall into place.Well worth a viewing 8/10.",10,2,3,12 April 2002
The Others," Surprisingly good
","I rented this movie with low expectations, but I was ultimately quite surprised at how good it was.  I don't want to give anything away; the enjoyment is in watching this movie without preconceived notions.  Nicole Kidman is excellent in this film... much better than she was in 'Moulin Rouge!'  The sets are appropriately dark and creepy.  'The Others' is worth checking out.  7/10.",7,0,0,3 June 2002
L.A. Confidential," A victim of the worst Oscar snub in history...
","At least as far back as I can remember.  L.A. Confidential is a well written, stylish movie.  The acting was superb.  Even Kim Basinger was quite good in this film.  If you like 50's cop dramas... see this movie.The fact this movie lost out to Titanic for best picture is the biggest error the Academy has ever made.  It should have been the choice hands down. I guess everyone makes mistakes sometimes.  8/10.",8,0,1,12 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Cold and Detached feeling
","I grew up with Star Wars.  I loved episodes IV, V, and VI.  I can't help but feel disappointed though with the prequels.  It goes well beyond the inanity of Jar-Jar Binks.  Episodes I and II seem fundamentally flawed.  The basic story is dry.  There is action, but no excitement... no tension.  Part of this is the problem inherent in a prequel:  you already know what is going to happen.  But it goes beyond that.  The actual sequence of events has no electricity.  This is compounded by the wooden acting that is rampant in this film (and Episode I).  Since I know that McGregor, Portman, Lee, and others can act from other movies I've seen them in, I suspect the problem lies with Lucas's direction.  Lucas is a wonderful producer and good at creating a basic plot, but he should stay far away from the screenplay and direction.  What he has managed to do with Episodes I and II is create the visually stunning equivalent of a slow motion train wreck.5/10 (though 2 of those points are bonus points because I was brainwashed by Star Wars in the 80's... actual score is 3/10)",5,0,1,4 March 2003
The Princess Bride," One of the best family movies ever made
","I'm not really a big fan of the 'Family Movie' genre... but Princess Bride is actually a very good movie.  It's probably the only movie I like, besides Star Wars, that would be age appropriate for younger viewers.  The story, which is typical faery tale stuff, is helped by an all-star cast.  If I had kids this is the only movie I could watch with them without wanting to hang myself halfway through it.  7/10",7,1,2,19 June 2002
JFK," Trash
","A mediocre movie at best, made worse by Stone's terrible direction.  I have two major problems with this film:1.  JFK is a vehicle of pure propaganda, promoting Jim Garrison's flawed and poorly developed theories of a conspiracy to kill the president.  Stone would have better served the viewing public by taking the time to develop his own theories rather than depending on the reactionary witch-hunt that Garrison perpetrated.  In the world of Garrison there is a rifle-wielding assassin over every grassy knoll.  I'm not suggesting that there is no evidence of a conspiracy to kill the president; I'm saying that Garrison's research into JFK's assassination was sloppy, lazy, and relied too much on conjecture... just like the investigation of the Warren Commission.2.  Stone's direction on the cinematography is horrendous.  It's the equivalent of giving a 3 year old a camera and letting him film the movie. Stone's style is more subdued in this movie than in U-Turn or Natural Born Killers, but it's still annoying as hell.  I would blame cinematographer Robert Richardson, but he has shown the ability to do reasonable cinematography in 'Snow Falling on Cedars' and 'Wag the Dog'.  Stone is the one responsible for the epileptic camera style.All in all, JFK is a substandard 'historical' movie.  Stone sank even lower on Nixon four years later.  3/10.",2,17,43,17 May 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Good concept, but ultimately a very flawed film.
","I honestly don't understand the hype about this movie.  The acting was mediocre at best.  The cinematography was good, but it was damaged by poor editing.  Flashy, quick scene cuts dominate this film.  The plot was predictable and I thought the dialogue was too fast and furious to even keep up with in many places and I personally disliked the usage of 80's/90's pop and rock lyrics and music.  I will say I was amazed at how well Ewan McGregor could sing; he blew Nicole Kidman out of the water.I found 'Moulin Rouge!' insipid and uninspired.  Ultimately, blame for this film's flaws can be laid squarely on the director Baz Luhrmann (who also co-wrote the screenplay).  At least it wasn't as bad Luhrmann's butchering of Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet (1996).  4/10",2,2,4,11 April 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Very interesting movie
","I saw this a few weeks ago on DVD.  Good movie.  I disagree with the reviewer who had the opinion you have to have some sort of uncertainty about your sexuality to enjoy this film.  I will say though that if you are uncomfortable with sexual ambiguity and/or crossdressing you may not wish to view this film.  That being said, the music was sweet, the costumes were quite good, and I found the plot rather funny.  Worth checking out.  7/10.",8,0,1,11 April 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Disturbing
","I first saw this movie when I was 14 and it messed me up.  10+ years later it's still sort of unsettling to watch.  Malcolm McDowell is superb as Alex. The film is stylish, but a bit dated 30 years later.  Still a solid film with an interesting message (though not the same message that the book had... Kubrick changed the ending).  Not for children or the faint of heart. Clockwork Orange is not Kubrick's best work, but still a solid movie.  8/10.",8,0,0,6 June 2002
Titanic," Snooze
","I give James Cameron credit for being an accomplished producer, but he and George Lucas have one unfortunate thing in common: they both can write a good story and are capable of overseeing a project, but James and George are both sub-par at dialogue and are terrible directors from an actor standpoint.  That is what kills Titanic.  The movie is visually stunning and the story moves along fairly well, but the acting is just not up to snuff. This surprised me a bit because DiCaprio and Winslet have been good individually in other movies, but here they seem wooden and constrained by sappy dialogue.My other major problem with this movie is the predictability inherent in the story.  I will say that I am prejudiced against movies that don't contain some element of surprise.  Because this is a movie about the Titanic you know the boat sinks (unless you slept through elementary school).  It makes the end rather anti-climactic. So why is this the highest grossing movie of all time?  Because apparently 14 year old girls will pay again and again to watch a tragic love story on the big screen.  It only took me one viewing to realize I don't ever need to watch this movie again.  2/10.",2,2,5,29 January 2003
Am√©lie," A fun and rather unconventional movie
","I rather enjoyed this movie.  Amelie is not the same cookie cutter love story that is being told over and over in American movies.  The story is quirky and amusing, as is Audrey Tautou.  She looks an awful lot like Audrey Hepburn.  I also found it interesting that there was no profanity in this movie, though it got an R rating for some sexual content.  I can't remember that last time I say and R rated movie where nobody swore.Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a fantastic director with a real visual flair.  I've loved his work since I saw City of Lost Children.  Now if I could just find a copy of Delicatessen.That being said, this movie is not for everyone.  I suspect many will be turned off by the fast paced story telling or will be so hyped up from the good press this movie received they can't help but be disappointed.  I knew nothing about this movie when I saw it.  Go into this with no preconceived notions and you might be pleasantly surprised.  8/10",9,0,2,22 July 2002
Donnie Darko," Not a bad little film
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*Donnie Darko surprised me.  Sure, some of the symbolism was a bit on the obvious side and the late 80's setting seemed pointless, but overall I found the movie rather enjoyable.  Through most of this movie I wasn't exactly sure what was going to happen.  Donnie Darko achieves this without descending into the incomprehensibility that plagued other time warp movies like Lost Highway.  For me that goes a long way towards making a movie enjoyable.  The acting was decent, the script was good, and the directing wasn't bad (it was his first film so I'll cut him some slack).  Darko is a niche movie though and will not be enjoyed by all audiences.  Not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it was more enjoyable than the usual crap Hollywood is cranking out these days. I'd rather see 100 movies like Donnie Darko get greenlighted than one more Pearl Harbor or Charlie's Angels II. 6/10",6,0,0,10 March 2003
All the President's Men," Still a great movie 25+ years later
","With the 30th anniversary of Watergate, I decided to watch this movie again. It's still great all these years later, maybe because the mysteries it posed then are still relevant today.  Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford together in the same movie are enough to make it good, but the story pushes it over the top and makes this a great film.  8/10.",8,1,1,19 June 2002
