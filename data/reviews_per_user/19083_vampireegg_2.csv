It," It jumps with might
","I've seen 1408, The Shining, The Mist. They all had some things in common that define King movies:unnerving tension, paranoia, and an awesome spooky environment that builds up tension. 'It' lacks all of them. Just a dumb jump-scare movie, it offers neither a solid story, nor any logic. Apparently, a ghost can appear anywhere, any time and does whatever he likes. He lives in the sewers, but that doesn't stop him from appearing in a slaughter house or out of a TV, just because it makes a good jump scare. He apparently feeds on people's fear, but that doesn't mean he can't bite your hand off if he is really hungry. All the kids are bullied, by older kids, by their parents, every-one of them has a bad-ass parent! The effects are cheesy, jump scares and blood are everywhere. 'It' tried to copy its settings from Stranger Things, scares from all other more successful jump-scare movies which at least build some tension, and mashes them all to create a good for nothing story.",5,0,5,22 September 2017
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Action Packed, Heartless
","The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug review: It contains lots of actions, lots of them. However, every time I watch LOTR, there are scenes where I always feel teary. The Hobbit feeds on the glory of the LOTR. Still, it's completely emotionless. Completely. The chill of 'Far Over the Misty Mountains Cold' is now long gone, hobbit 2 is now just a hack and slash action movie, where you'll find yourself caring for nobody. The first movie was much better than this, which really had some emotional moments. Hobbit 2 destroyed even its predecessor. I earnestly hope Hobbit 3 keeps up with the spirit of the great Lord of the Rings. Middle earth is the land of dreams and fairy tales. Please let not ruin them with meaningless actions.",6,6,8,20 January 2014
