Raiders of the Lost Ark," Who doesn't love this movie?
","Raiders of the Lost Ark has it all. Action, stunts, babes, visual effects, villains, and much more. This movie is probably one of the most fun movies you will see in your lifetime, and is liked by all ages. Harrison Ford plays his role perfectly, and you end up rooting for him to kill those evil nazis. He drops hilarious one-liners all the time, and this film never takes itself too seriously.All in all, one of the best movies ever made. Pure fun.
