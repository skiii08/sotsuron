Miracle," 8/10 movie about a 10/10 accomplishment
","It's hard to recreate the magic of a once-in-a-lifetime event, but Miracle comes pretty close. It succeeds in recapturing the spirit of the times, the personality of coach Herb Brooks, the tension of the game, and the exhilaration of Al Michaels' famous call as the clock went to 0:00. While there are plenty of minor things I could quibble about, Miracle's ability to recapture the spirit of the Soviet upset makes it a success. A movie about this subject could easily have been a stinker, but Miracle isn't that at all. It's a great sports movie that suffers only in comparison to the real story. I gave it 8/10.",Null,33,42,17 September 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Tolerable, but far short of the originals
","*** CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS ***T3 is weighed down by a poor script. John Connor is a whiny drifter, reduced to stealing meds from a pet hospital, beaten up by a woman, and unable to escape from a simple dog cage. What happened to the middle-schooler who broke into Cyberdyne, taught a killing machine the value of human life, and actually looked the part of a future resistance leader?The villainess of the piece, T-something-or-other, is a clone of the liquid metal bad guy from T2. Only dumber, and with some implausible new skills, like the ability to change cup sizes.There are plot holes and inconsistencies all over the place. For example, they explain that the Ah-Nold character in this movie doesn't know what the Terminator from T2 knew because it's a different unit. But it still goes out of its way not to kill anyone, as in T2. And if you can believe it, John Connor's biography and the history of the future become even more confusing. Worse than that, there's a revelation that will make you wonder why any of the characters even bother.Having thoroughly established that T3 doesn't live up to its predecessors, let me say it isn't all bad. The major action scenes are comparable to those from T1 or T2. The Governor of California once again plays the machine in his mechanical, but oddly likable way. I can't find fault with any of the actor's performances; they do the best they can.Another reviewer said that T3 should not be considered 'canon.' If you care about such things, you won't like T3. But if you can accept the film's limitations, and overlook the bad attempts at humor, it's a decent action movie. I gave it 6 out of 10.",Null,0,0,17 September 2004
Liar Liar," Skip the beginning and the end
","...and just watch the middle part of the film, the part where Jim Carrey's character (Fletcher Reede) can't lie. Fortunately, that's most of the film.The main plot involving Fletcher's relationship with his ex-wife and young son is dull and mostly devoid of laughs. Maura Tierney has a few moments, but the family seemed to have been tacked on to provide a premise to the punchline of Jim Carrey not being able to lie.The subplots involving Fletcher's work are far more entertaining. He's forced to deal with an embittered secretary, a back-stabbing harlot coworker, a husky-voiced, promiscuous client (Jennifer Tilly), an unsympathetic judge, a boardroom full of stuffy superiors, and a lawsuit so ridiculous that F. Lee Bailey wouldn't touch it -- all while he can't lie, of course.Liar Liar would have been better if the family got the axe, and it were made entirely about Carrey's problems at work. But it was still pretty good, a definite hit after a couple misses (Batman Forever and The Cable Guy, plus maybe Dumb and Dumber).RATING: 7 of 10. If you like Jim Carrey, you'll like Liar Liar.",Null,0,0,13 May 2004
