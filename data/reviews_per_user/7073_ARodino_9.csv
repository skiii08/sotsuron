Casablanca," 'I love you so much. I hate war so much.'
","'Casablanca' is worth the praise it receives, and perhaps more. It's nearly easy to pick up and settle into, and, if patience pays off, you'll be rewarded with mixture of great characters, wonderful atmosphere, and a dramatic plot. Humphrey Bogart comes of as one of the most interesting characters in movie history. He displays both his organization and his corruption. He plays both a winner and a loser, and I think that shows how different he is from the other characters. Ingrid Bergman also shares these traits, but the overall outcome of the story is in Bogart's hands, so all Bergman can do is reflect on her decisions throughout the film. Another character worth a quick shout-out is Dooley Wilson. He wasn't given as much clever or reflective dialogue as Bogart, but that's not to say he's pointless. Wilson is the shadow that follows Bogart: He plays songs for him that can even sometimes reflect on what he thinks about ('As Time Goes By'). He stuck with Bogart from France to Casablanca and continued working for him. In a way, he acts as a symbolic reminder of Bogart's life with Bergman.",Null,0,1,18 October 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," 'I smell spare ribs. Somebody's been eatin' spare ribs. How come I ain't got none?'
","'The Grapes of Wrath' probably could of been advertised as a documentary, had it not been for its narrative-style story-telling. The historical context of the movie's setting, characters, and conflict makes it seem like a genuine account of a farming family surviving after the Great Depression. At first, you're not sure if this will be a good movie, mostly because of the behaviors of Charley Grapewin and Zeffie Tilbury's characters, who come off as some sort of senile comic relief pair. Later on, however, you realize that the movie is shaped around the struggle this family encounters as they go West. Henry Fonda makes for an incredible lead role, mostly because of the fact that he's a criminal and the last thing you'd expect for him to act like a generic 'momma's boy.' It's his rebelliousness that also makes this character likable, seeing how we could of acted the same way if we were in his shoes. The dialogue is memorable, the shadows and sound effects really draw in the atmosphere of West, and the final speech(es) of the film tie everything together spectacularly. After watching this film, there's a cleansing feeling you get from seeing this film, as if all the worries of the world momentarily drained out in the past two hours.",Null,0,0,10 October 2011
The Exorcist," 'Of course I like him. I like pizzas too, but I'm not gonna marry one.'
","'The Exorcist' is the film that I simply adore. The characters are memorable, the setting successfully changes in darkness depending on what's happening on the screen, and its topic is on that's fit for a scary movie adaption. Linda Blair's performance is what makes the movie frightening: Turning from a sweet girl into a something so evil is the best transition I've ever seen on screen. I was expecting a little more from whatever possessed Blair's character, but I'm still psyched over the climax of the film that I think was still worth making these characters interact the way they did. There's no words awesome enough to describe the showdown between the good verses the evil. Both sides seem equally-matched and deliver an ending that not only throws you off, but it solidifies the image of the struggle between two opposites.",9,1,2,11 December 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," 'I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over. '
","'2001: A Space Odyssey' is not as much of a film, as it is more of a large-scale art piece. Divided into four acts, the film is blotched throughout with extended scenes which demonstrate most of its impressive special effects and celestial shots of space. Aside from such scenes, the movie uses influitive characters, astonishing long takes, and a soundtrack that heavily distorts any form of distraction away from the movie. In the third act, the HAL 9000 computer, named 'Hal' in the film, comes off as a clever and terrifying twist to an old science-fiction clich√©. Another thing to enjoy about the film is the beginning act, which ties in an extraordinary discovery made by ape-men in prerecorded history to the way the weapon was first discovered.",Null,0,1,20 November 2011
The Graduate," 'Wood or wire? They have both. '
","'The Graduate' is the first film that has ever confused me; Not in its plot or production, but in understanding the underlying message of the entire movie. From beginning to end, I found myself revolting, even hating, Dustin Hoffman's character, who slowly becomes more and more repulsive and frightening. However, when up against a conflict, I'm rooting for Hoffman again, before sliding back into disgust, and then the cycle repeats. The rest of the film is clear as to how much I enjoy it, such as its use of water, montages, transitions, and music. It's just that I can't decipher what I should truly feel about what makes these characters. I'm completely lost for words.",6,0,1,4 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," 'Hello! This is a demonstration of a talking picture. Notice, it is a picture of me and I am talking.'
","'Singin' in the Rain' makes you complete forget about how oppressive Gene Kelly was during the making of this film. I love how bright and colorful the sets were, as well as the characters. The songs are also incredibly memorable; 'Singin' in the Rain,' 'Make 'Em Laugh,' and 'Moses Supposes,' to name a few, are going to be stuck in your head for days later. Donald O'Conner is probably my favorite actor in the movie, mostly because of his attitude and delivery. He's keeps the beat, executes some fantastic moves, and, for guy who admitted to being afraid of messing up around Kelly, he certainly seems like one of the happiest and care-free characters in the movie. I actually think he reminds me of Stephen Stucker, the bizarre actor of 'Airplane!' fame.",Null,0,1,6 November 2011
Psycho," '...With my trusty umbrella.'
","'Psycho' is one of the most brilliantly-executed thrillers that I've ever seen. After seeing such films as 'Rebecca' and 'Sabotage,' I can see how different this films appear and feel from other Hitchcock films. It's easy to be swept into its terrific atmosphere and characters, and you never expect what happens next in the plot. The score for the film is also spectacular; I could listen to the opening credits track all day. The infamous shower scene was a well-constructed part of the movie. I like how it was shot, the position of the characters in the shot, and the music during the shot. Alfred Hitchcock hit everything right on the nail and produced one of the most shocking scenes in cinema.",Null,0,0,6 November 2011
The Producers," ''Gregor Samsa awoke one morning to discover that he had been transformed into a giant cockroach.' Nah, it's too good. '
","'The Producers' is an exceptional first film for Mel Brooks. His direction is spot-on to what we've come to expect Brooks to do in later films, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are likable and developed, and Brooks even manages to pull off a few shots I had never seen before in his movies, such as the extreme long shot used when the fountain shoots up. It's a scene that looks so great, that Brooks placed it as the final scene of the end credits. It's really hard to hate a Mel Brooks film, and this is no exception. It's like a pressed lump of gold, flattened paper thin and draped over the projector. He took a great idea with great characters and made it into a great movie. It's that simple.",7,1,2,4 December 2011
Saboteur," 'Bathing suits looked awfully funny a hundred years ago.'
","'Saboteur' shows that in order for Alfred Hitchcock to make great films, he must first make films that are less than spectacular. I had high hopes for this film. It was shot beautifully (This IS a Hitchcock film, after all) and it's great to see Priscilla Lane's character actually DO something to help the main character and herself, which breaks away from that commonly irritable label about damsels in distress. However, the film seems to drop everything that we knew about the characters' personas and identities towards the end. I'm not sure why, but it appears that the characters instantly stop acting the way they have been throughout the entire film, and suddenly become someone different. Lane's very outspoken character begins to act very small around the center of the movie, and then snaps back to her usual self. The police change overtime as well, but it's probably because they cycle between different police departments in different cities. Aside from the bizarre character behaviors, I also felt the ending could use some more work. Without giving anything away, I'll just say this: If the ending to 'Sabotaur' could be structured like the ending to another Hitchcock film, like perhaps 'Foreign Correspondent,' then perhaps it would have been something reflective. Other than that, the film works, but not in the way you think it will.",Null,0,1,23 October 2011
