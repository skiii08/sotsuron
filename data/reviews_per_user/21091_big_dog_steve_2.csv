The Blair Witch Project," The Scariest Movie I have ever seen.
","All I can say is...WOW. This is one Hell of a movie.  I was able to see this movie with some friends in Baltimore, MD on opening night of the 16th (Limited Release).  The first hour is mostly slow but funny, as you see how the three get on each others nerves.  Quickly the scene changes and everything becomes very serious, you find these kids are hunted, and the fact that you don't hear a narrator or ever see the camera pull away to show you the whole story is very disturbing.  At no point in this story do you see limbs being cut off, or monsters in the dark, with beady eyes.  This is a true thriller, you start being really scared about 1 hour into the movie, and the terror doesn't leave you until the next morning.  I walked out of the move with a pale face, and an open jaw.  Pay attention to the movie, it is meant to scare you, so don't walk in thinking it is a movie, because it isn't.",5,1,3,21 July 1999
The Matrix," Brief Commenting on The Matrix.
","I was quite surprised when I finally sat down to see the Matirx.  Like most of you who saw it in its first week running, I had no Idea about the plot and just assumed it would be a good Special Effects Movie.  Man, was I totally wrong.  After about 20 minutes into the movie you are asking yourself 'Hey, is Keanu Reeves really acting this well?'.  I sat and stared in awe, at the screen, the plot was deep, the story had meaning, and Keanu actually put serious effort into this one.  He didn't seem like the normal Wooden Soldier... and Laurence Fishburne, man he is totally under appreciated, he played a heck of a part.  All in all, one hell of a movie, I give it a 8.  Most Def. with going to see, and don't make the mistake of waiting till home video, this one has to be seen in the theaters, and make it a Sony digital theater.",10,0,0,27 April 1999
