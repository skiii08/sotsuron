The New World," what i thought about this film!
","I give all of the worlds movie fans a warning about this film, it has to be out of my mind one of the most boring films i have ever seen in my life. i nearly walked out of the cinema and demanded a refund because it was that bad. The film hardly has any talking, it is mostly packed with slow-instrumental music which makes you wanna scream in the cinema. please don't pay any money to see this film, i wouldn't watch this film again if you gave me Â£1 million pounds. The sad thing is that it looks good from the trailers but i am being honest it is far from it. This film has to be the worst film i have ever seen. the cast was horrific and dreadful, Colin Ferrel was really horrible and cheesy and thats the only famous person i know who is in this film the rest of the cast i have never even seen or heard of.",1,1,7,10 May 2006
