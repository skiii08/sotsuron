Come and See," Masterpiece of Russian Cinema
","Incredible film - a stark reminder of the depths of insanity humans can descend to when faced with war. Whilst the film is very sombre and bleak, it's the beautiful cinematography that holds your attention from start to finish. I watched this film in anticipation of its Criterion remaster coming up in June this year, and all I can say is I'm glad it's going to be getting more attention.",9,0,0,8 April 2020
Rear Window," Still holds up today.
","Decided to delve into Hitchcock's films since I've never seen any of his before, starting with Rear Window. I was surprised from the very start of the first act how the whole concept of the story felt so unique and modern, even by today's standards. The set design combined with the constantly shifting colour palettes reflecting the time of day was beautifully done, and the sound just captures that feel of an inner city suburb late at night so well. Probably will watch again at some point.",9,2,2,24 March 2020
