Scarface," Everything I want in a film
","This is an excellent all-around movie. It has everything I look for in a film.  It is realistic, it has a good storyline, it has interesting characters who are well portrayed, it has action, suspence, and good comic relief. People are discouraged when they see the 2 hr and 50 min running time, but when you start watching it, you won't want to stop, and the hours will pass by like minutes.  Every part of the show is interesting and you won't be bored with unnecessary, uninteresting, and waste-of-time scenes like they have in most 3hr shows. Another unique thing is that at the end of the three hours, I feel  like watching it again.  The time it takes to watch the show doesn't drain you of all your movie watching energy, because it goes by so fast.  It leaves you wanting more, even though it's given you everything.  At the end of most shows you do a great big yawn and get off your couch and stretch and say 'That was  good.'  and then stumble off to bed.  Most shows make you feel tired at the end, and you feel repelled at the thought of watching another movie that day (or that week).  But Scarface makes you feel good afterwards (even though it's filled with disgusting  violence and  excessive profanity). Another good thing about it is Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeifer, the two best actors in the world. So go watch this movie with an open mind  and enjoy it without focusing on the time, and don't dismiss it as soon as you see the disturbing violence and don't try to count all the f-words. Let yourself be entertained and don't think about it or evaluate it  until after the whole show is over.",10,0,0,30 July 1999
The Godfather: Part III," A waste of talent
",This movie felt like it was written and directed by different people. The writing was poor and the direction did not seem like Coppola's. It seemed like an immitation Godfather movie. All the power this movie has is drawn from the first two. It does nothing on it's own. The only thing I truly enjoyed about this movie was Eli Wallach's performance. I love that guy.,8,0,1,9 October 2003
