Raiders of the Lost Ark," What can I Say--- One of the best movies ever made
","Great Character in the lead, Action, Adventure.  This was the first movie I ever watched as a kid and Steven Spielburg and George Lucas always bring alive the WW2 era and period, as well as the Nazis very well.  All three movies in the trilogy had this atmosphere about them, hope they make more. Can't wait for the Collectors edition DVD.",10,0,0,2 September 2001
