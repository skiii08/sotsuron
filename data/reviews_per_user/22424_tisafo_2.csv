Blade Runner 2049," Visual gem, uneasy topic.
","This last opus of Denis Villeneuve, my fellow countryman from Quebec, does not possess the intelligence, fineness and sensibility of 'The Arrival' which ran for the Oscar in 2016. The rendition of a futuristic and doomed world is absolutely stunning, troubling, credible, aesthetic. This is in my opinion reason number one to go watch this movie. All along the film, one wonders 'Is he/she a replicant?' There is a thin line between artificial/natural intelligence, a very fine boundary impossible to be crossed. These are in my opinion, the two main assets of this visually stunning movie. However, keep in mind this movie is all about artificial life. Therefore, there is no artifices. Replicants are boring characters. Dialogues are unnecessary cryptic, a polite expression for 'bad'. Storyline is complex. Like many pieces of art, to be seen more than once.",8,5,14,6 October 2017
Hereditary," A true nightmare.
","Nightmarish,scary,creepy from beginning to end.The mood of this film reminds me of Rosemary's baby. I honestly liked this movie. I had the impression of being in a nightmare from which it was impossible for me to emerge, throughout the movie.",8,3,6,23 August 2018
