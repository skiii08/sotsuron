The Blair Witch Project," Not a very good movie
","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]Why this movie ever has gotten anyone's attention or admiration is a mystery to me.Before watching I had read about it on the net, in newspaper's and so on. Therefore I was expecting something new, something out of the ordinary, something memorable, but this was just a waste of time. Mostly it reminded me of movies that one of my friends used to produce in his backyard when we were at school and the dialogue in his films was better. That this movie has gotten the attention it has could only happen in the States, I think, where the craving for something new is more pertinent than the craving for something good.First of all there is nothing remotely scary about it, just three kids in long johns running around in the middle of the night frightening each other. Secondly the 'realism' is plain phony and the story is badly told, nothing hangs together. The quest these kids are undertaking is badly researched, badly prepared and badly executed. The witch never becomes real in any true sense, so the story of her fails to add to the scare. All the things the kids encounter in the woods has the feel of silly pranks and Josh' disappearance makes no sense. Nobody in their right mind would toss the map and nobody in their right mind would follow the female lead anywhere, since she's constantly screaming and commanding the guys around. I surprised they didn't make her disappear instead.This could perhaps have been a good movie and even a scary one, but it would need some script work, a knowledge of plot structure and better actors, not just a snappy web site or two.",2,1,3,19 September 1999
Children of Heaven," This is really all it takes!
","Very few movies has the quality of tenderness without being sentimental. This one does. A very simple plot unfolds the entire story of present day life in Teheran. It is beautifully shot, very well acted and accomplishes with such simplicity what it intends. The sweetness with which the relationship between the two siblings is described is rare and their protection of their very poor parents is touching.There is especially one scene that has stayed with me, where the brother secretly tries to explain that he has lost his sister's shoes on the way from the shoe maker. This takes place in the family's one-room home when the children are supposed to be doing their homework and they are writing notes back and forth. The girl's mounting frustration with her brother and his reluctance to take the entire blame is so right and so funny as they try to keep it a secret from their parents.Every scene in the movie HAS to be there, nothing redundant, nothing superfluous. A pure delight. See it as soon as you get a chance.",Null,0,0,19 September 1999
