Vertigo," Not a masterpiece
","Vertigo divides audiences more than any other Hitchcock film.For one critic it is 'one of the four or five most profound and beautiful films the cinema has yet given us.' A poll of 150 international critics has three times voted it the second greatest movie ever made (after Citizen Kane). However, many viewers find it a crashing bore.I have sympathy for both camps.Vertigo is the film in which Hitchcock comes closest to dealing directly with his own personal demons. The surface story makes no sense by itself and only works if you respond to the powerful undercurrents in its subtext. But Hitchcock still has to get the surface story right. It must fully embody the subtext and engage with its audience. For many people, it doesn't quite do either.The prologue leaves Scottie hanging over an abyss. By not showing his rescue, Hitchcock effectively leaves him hanging there for the rest of the movie and his vertigo becomes a metaphor for his spiritual condition; he is poised between a longing for life and a longing for death. In rejecting the (real) life-affirming Midge and in his infatuation with the (illusory) death-obsessed Madeleine, he makes his fateful choice.However, the prologue also supports a literal interpretation of his vertigo and the next scene doesn't really establish that Scottie's problems go deeper than his understandable fear of heights. We learn that he and Midge were once lovers but there is no follow through that explains why he broke off the relationship or why he becomes besotted with what we later learn is just a fantasy women.The next scene, with Elster, is even more unfortunate and its defects reverberate throughout the movie. Elster could have been depicted as a sort of Mephistopheles, who sees Scottie's weakness and tempts him to his doom. In fact, he is thinly-sketched and is just a device for kicking off the story.More crucially, he tells Scottie too much about Madeleine's obsession with Carlotta. This virtually forces Scottie into being the level-headed sceptic and makes his subsequent neurotic behaviour even more arbitrary and difficult to believe. It also undermines the ten-minute wordless sequence of Scottie trailing Madeleine around San Francisco.If Elster has simply asked Scottie to investigate his wife's aimless wandering, we would have started out expecting something mundane (like an affair) only to be drawn into the much more intriguing mystery of her identification with Carlotta and her apparent sleepwalk towards suicide. As it is, the sequence merely confirms what Elster has already told us and often tries the patience of the audience. For many, the picture never recovers.Moreover, because Scottie's character is under-developed (and Stewart's performance is unable to realise what the story implies) the rest of the movie can be viewed as the tale of an ordinary man who becomes infatuated with an attractive, troubled, woman whose life he has saved. The shadow of Carlotta then becomes an incidental detail and we get only a weak sense that Scottie's love is an unhealthy obsession. His eventual break-down is then under-motivated and seems imposed on the picture rather than being integral to its structure (a feeling reinforced by Hitchcock's decision to present it in an abstract, symbolic way).I don't view Vertigo in this way, but I can sympathise with those that do.With Scottie's breakdown, the picture reaches a second turning point. When Midge walks down the hospital corridor and the screen fades to black, it feels as if the movie is over. Of course it isn't and what happens next is crucial. Nothing up to that point makes any sense without it. But a second structural flaw immediately emerges. We are three-quarters of the way through the movie but only half-way through the story. Just when Vertigo needs time to re-engage our interest after the false ending it suddenly accelerates.We get a montage that establishes Scottie's continuing obsession with Madeleine, then he spots Judy, follows her home and we are immediately plunged into a flashback that 'explains' the plot. This meeting needed much better preparation and the subsequent relationship needed more time to develop.By revealing the plot twist so early, Hitchcock is inviting us to see how self-defeating Scottie's neurotic behaviour really is: in recreating Madeleine he is inevitably destroying his own illusions. But he rushes through this process. We have no time to get to know the real Judy before we are confronted with Scottie's bizarre plan to transform her. Then, at the very moment the transformation is complete, Scottie immediately spots the deception so the picture gallops to its climax and then slams to a halt.As a good professional, Hitchcock was wary about letting any of his pictures run over two hours, but if he wanted to impose this discipline on himself, then he should have been more ruthless in pruning the first half of the story. In fact, he should have just accepted that this story couldn't be told effectively in two hours and have let it run on longer.We rightly admire Hitchcock's movies for their great set pieces, but tend to overlook their fragile story sense and relatively weak dramatic structure. Mostly, that didn't matter, but in an ambitious picture like Vertigo it is a fatal flaw.There is much more to Vertigo than its detractors acknowledge, but it is far from being the near-perfect masterpiece that its most fervent admirers would have us believe.",3,188,290,18 June 2008
Star Trek," The future begins, possibly
","I have never been a particularly avid Star Trek fan, so this was hardly a must-see movie for me. Nonetheless, I was intrigued to see if JJ Abrams could revive the show in the same way that Russell T Davis revived Dr Who a few years ago.The jury is still out.The screenplay isn't bad in terms of character establishment and some of the dialogue is noticeably sharp and effective. The plot is pretty dumb, with some gaping holes in its logic, but this isn't crucial because the story is really just a device to introduce the new crew members and set up further movies. I quite liked the new incarnations of Kirk, Spock, Scottie, Uhura and so on. I would be happy to spend more time with them, subject to one proviso: JJ Abrams must never be allowed near Star Trek again.For me, all enjoyment of this movie was sabotaged by his hyper-active direction. Every scene (almost every shot) is designed for maximum impact, but that means the movie has no light and shade. There is no change of pace, no pauses for reflection, no steady build up of tension and no overall dramatic arc. It starts with a climax and tries to stay there for the next two hours. But a movie that is all climaxes has no climax. The unvarying pace becomes exhausting and, ultimately, tedious.Every scene is directed in the same way. Half the dialogue is delivered on the move; people run rather than walk; the camera never stops moving; and most of the shots are too tight. The movie constantly runs the same gamut of visual devices: aerial shots, cranes; whip pans; zooms and endless Steadicam tracks through the crowded sets. The frantic visuals are then cranked up even further by the constant quick cutting. The action scenes, in particular, are all cut, cut, cut.Orson Welles once said that anyone could make a movie with a six inch lens and a pair of scissors but the test of a good director was what happened between cuts. Clearly, Abrams disagrees. At times, the cutting is so hectic that it seemed as if his contract must have specified that he wouldn't get paid if the camera ever stopped moving or he held a shot for more than five seconds.As a result, the Enterprise seems to be in a state of constant panic, with the camera zapping from character to character and everyone talking over each other, so that crucial explanatory lines are lost in the perpetual babble. The action scenes, where the cutting gets even quicker and the camera gets even tighter, are often reduced to a flurry of near-indecipherable, almost abstract images.This over-wrought style of shooting is becoming increasingly common, particularly in big action movies, and it is slowly driving me out of the cinema. However, Abrams manages to raise the irritation factor even higher with another visual affectation that I have always hated.Lens flare!!For more than 70 years, avoiding lens flare was one of the basic skills of a cinematographer. Then, in the mid-Sixties, it suddenly became fashionable to let it happen. I always disliked it because it just draws attention to the camera, but it was only a minor irritation in most movies - limited to a few exterior shots where (for example) car headlights shone directly into the lens. The first time it seriously bothered me was in Close Encounters, where it greatly compromised the magic of many of the effects sequences.By the early Eighties it seemed the vogue for lens flare was dying out, but in Star Trek it is back with a vengeance. Almost every shot in this movie is smothered with light streaks, rainbow effects, bleed over, visual echoes and halos that appear around every dust mote on the lens. Sometimes it is so extreme that the whole screen whites out.This is not only highly distracting in itself, but it undermines Abrams's whole directorial method. I might not like his high-adrenaline style, but I can appreciate what he is trying to do. The tight shots and the restless camera is trying to draw us right into the centre of the action, so we become part of it. However, the ubiquitous lens flare immediately hooks us out again, putting a barrier between us and what is happening on the screen. It feels like we are standing in the street, watching the whole movie through the reflections on a dirty shop window.Of course, the blame must be shared by the Art Director, who peppered every set with those bright, low-level lights and with the cinematographer who failed to persuade Abrams to let him him filter out the problem.Although I regard this movie as an unmitigated disaster, there is no reason why the next movie shouldn't be much better. For me, Star Trek was never really about the characters or the endless elaboration of the Star Trek universe. At its heart, Star Trek was just an efficient vehicle for tackling a wide range of SF ideas. That hasn't changed.A good SF story typically takes the form of a puzzle that has to be solved by a deadline. In SF books we don't care too much about fine writing or subtle characterisation (although they do no harm). All we really want is an intriguing problem with an ingenious solution. There are still plenty of good SF stories waiting to be told.Having introduced the new characters and re-launched the series, a couple of good stories is all it will take to make me forget this frustrating aberration.Despite everything, I am not without hope.PS: On re-reading this, I still stand by what I wrote, but I also have to acknowledge that Abrams has injected a bit of life into what had become a very stodgy show.",1,24,38,19 May 2009
Battleship Potemkin," A sense of proportion
","I don't want to be controversial just for the sake of it, but I have to ask if this really is the classic it is supposed to be.It is often quite exciting in a purely visceral way and has some striking images and memorable sequences (the Odessa Steps being the most celebrated), but has little or no emotional depth and is rarely moving.In essence it is a piece of fairly crude Communist propaganda, so its undoubted technical merits have to be seen in the light of what it was promoting. In 1925, the worst may still have been in the future but the Leninist wind had been sown and the Stalinist whirlwind was soon to be reaped. I feel as uncomfortable praising this movie as praising Leni Riefenstal's work.As for its technical merits, have they not also been somewhat overblown? Of course, Eisenstein orchestrates images very well and any film company in the world at that time would have been happy to employ him. But as good as he was, there were many other film-makers doing similar things and sometimes doing them just as well.If this movie has had any lasting influence on cinema (which is doubtful) it is probably on second unit directors, shooting crowd scenes and action sequences, rather than on other major artists. Some of the most striking moments (the famous lion statues, for example) were pure silent cinema and within a couple of years these 'innovations' were largely redundant.The irony is that Eisenstein's own masterpiece, Ivan the Terrible, has far more in common with Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc than it does with this movie. Similarly, more recent Russian directors like Tarkovsky were more influenced by Ivan than by Battleship.I suspect this picture was lionised chiefly by critics and cultural pundits who were only occasional movie-goers and who were once memorably described by Andrew Sarris as 'slummers from the other arts'. In short, people who had no real idea how movies were made and had seen very few of the other movies that were crucial benchmarks for a proper evaluation of this one. They credited Eisenstein with inventing what all half-decent movie-makers had routinely been doing for a decade.Battleship Potemkin is undoubtedly of some historical interest, but it is not a great work of art (by a long stretch), it is not nearly as original or innovative as movie-illiterates have often claimed and its ultimate impact on the development of movie technique has been hugely overestimated.This movie is certainly worth watching at least once or twice on its own merits. It won't disappoint.But let us keep a sense of proportion, please!",7,2,5,7 February 2007
Eyes Wide Shut," Decline and fall
","Eyes Wide Shut has some unusually eloquent and persuasive advocates and some equally eloquent and persuasive detractors.If I gravitate towards the detractors it is because I see this movie as the culmination of a trend in Kubrick's work that had long troubled me.Rather than attempt a detailed analysis of its strengths and weaknesses (both of which have been covered in other excellent IMDb reviews) I would merely use it as an illustration of what I see as Kubrick's principal weakness as a film-maker. He was too slow and got progressively slower.I mean this in three senses.Firstly, I cannot help noting that it took him just 8 years to make his first 5 features and another 35 years to make his next 5.These later pictures all spent years in development. I doubt if this long gestation period was a good thing. If you spend too long thinking about a picture it is easy to lose track of why you wanted to make it in the first place (A.I.?) and there is always a danger that you will end up squeezing the life out of it.Secondly, when Kubrick finally got a project into production he would take months and months to shoot it (14 months for Eyes Wide Shut). Notoriously he shot dozens of takes of every scene, constantly trying out new things. He got away with this because he used a very small crew and was very economical. His pictures may have taken an age to complete but they never went over budget.But again, I suspect this obsessive concern with the minutiae of every shot was counter-productive. Sometimes, Kubrick couldn't see the wood for the trees. He was so focused on how each individual scene should play that he lost sight of how the picture as a whole would work with an audience. You cannot force a movie to be great just by sheer hard work and painstaking attention to detail.Thirdly, the movies themselves are often too slow and none more so than Eyes Wide Shut.For one thing, no movie in recent years has spent so much time just getting characters from one scene to another. When they cross a room we see every step. For example, Tom Cruise is called to the bedside of one of his patients. We see him in a taxi, tortured by thoughts of his wife with another man. Then Kubrick cuts to an empty lobby just as the elevator arrives. The door opens and Cruise walks slowly across the lobby and through another doorway. As he does so, the camera dollies to the left so we can see him pass through that door and across another room. He rings the bell of an apartment. We cut to the interior of the apartment. A maid enters from the right and walks all the way across the hall to open the door and let Cruise in. She takes his coat and they exchange a couple of words before Cruise walks across the hall and over to the bedroom door. He knocks. Next, we cut to an interior of the bedroom. The door is opened and Cruise walks in. Finally the scene begins. And this is from the man who once spanned 5 million years with a single jump cut!This scene is not an exception. The whole movie is like that.This is compounded by the highly stylised acting that Kubrick came to love. In this movie, people often talk in slow motion. Nicole Kidman, in particular, is often required to break each sentence down into disconnected fragments, with agonising pauses between them. This is not her normal style and must have been specifically dictated by Kubrick.Fine - except that much of the dialogue is achingly banal and unconvincing. Tom Cruise's flirtation with the two girls at the party is feeble enough, but those lines sound like Oscar Wilde in comparison to the ones exchanged by Sky Dumont and Nicole Kidman. What was Kubrick thinking of?This is a valid question, because he probably knew exactly what he was doing. If the dialogue is banal it was because he wanted it that way. If the pacing is funereal it is because it was part of his design for the picture. I suspect that he wanted it to play like a lucid dream. Lucid dreams seem very normal when they are happening: it is only on reflection that you realise how strange they actually were. In Eyes Wide Shut, Kubrick was probably aiming at an apparently realistic surface, but with subtly surrealistic undertones.For me it didn't work. The surface is just too prosaic to hold the interest and the undertones are too studied and too calculated to be unsettling. As a result, the movie is cold and clinical when it needs to be passionate and engaged.Ultimately, there is too much thought and too little feeling: too much technique and too little instinct.I would draw a somewhat artificial distinction between movie artists and movie entertainers. It has nothing to do with quality: there are lousy artists and great entertainers. The difference is that artists make the movies they feel they have to make. Entertainers make the movies they feel their audiences want to see. Unquestionably, Kubrick was an artist. He always followed his own Muse. For a long time I was happy to go along for the ride, but eventually his Muse took him to places where I couldn't follow.From my perspective, his career after 2001: A Space Odyssey was mostly a story of decline and fall.",3,3,7,17 June 2009
War of the Worlds," Unsolved problems
","Wells's book was a sensation. Partly, I suspect, because of the timing. The end of the Nineteenth Century was a period of great optimism and confidence. Technological advances were transforming the world and Britain was at the heart of these developments.The British Empire spanned the globe and to many of Wells's readers it must have seemed as if the Pax Britannia would ensure order and progress for the foreseeable future.Wells set about puncturing that complacency. He envisaged intelligences greater than ours: 'vast, cool and unsympathetic.' The Martians sweep aside Britain's military might as easily as swatting flies. By the end of the book one character, the Artilleryman, is speculating that the only future for Mankind will be to burrow underground and live like rats in a Martian sewer system. It was this startling new perspective on Man (reduced to vermin to be casually exterminated) that must have shocked Wells's readers. Of course, this fate is averted, but not by our efforts. We are saved by bacteria: 'the humblest things that God in His wisdom put upon this Earth.' I suspect that the irony and bathos of this ending were always part of Wells's scheme for the book, but what works on the page does not always work on the screen. From a film maker's point of view the book has three problems.Firstly, it is a piece of archaic science fiction. If you update it, our own military technology is already more advanced than what Wells envisaged for his Martians. Secondly, Wells's hero is essentially passive: he observes events but cannot shape them. Then there is that damp squib of an ending: the Martians catch cold and die!Spielberg's film is a combination of the book and George Pal's 1953 version. Like Pal, he updates the story. But now the Martians are confronted by the whole infrastructure of a modern military machine. Spielberg tackles this problem in three ways. Firstly, (like Pal) he equips the Martians with a defensive shield to negate the much more powerful weapons now arraigned against them. Secondly, he tells the story entirely from the point of view of an ordinary man, so he never has to confront the issue of exactly what weapons the Martians have or how successful the military are in fighting them. These devices work well, but I am less sure about his third strategy.Wells's capsules are fired across space by gigantic cannons and when they land are too hot to approach. Spielberg obviously felt this was too clunky for a contemporary audience, so his war machines are already here. This is scarcely any more plausible and has the disadvantage of robbing him of his first Act. In Pal's version the arrival of the first capsule gets the story off with a bang and waiting for it to cool allows him time to introduce his characters. Spielberg has to spend ten or fifteen minutes introducing the characters before anything happens.Spielberg's solution to the second problem is more satisfying. His character is not a shaper of events, but he has a purpose: he has to get his children safely to their mother in Boston. The movie becomes a story of survival and resourcefulness and generally works well. The only flaw is his treatment of the son, whose constant bickering soon starts to grate. We are supposed to applaud his eagerness to fight the Martians. Instead, we are exasperated by him for being so pigheaded and selfish that his sister is nearly lost as a result.Despite this cavil, this part of the movie works well. It is the ending that has disappointed most people. In Pal's movie the irony of Wells's ending is entirely lost. When the voice-over narrator repeats that famous line Pal invites us to conclude that Man has indeed been saved by divine intervention. Wells would have hated Pal's religiosity.Spielberg seems much more aware of the irony and wants to preserve it. Perhaps he saw a parallel between Wells's Britain and post-communist era America. Both countries were at the height of their power and needed taking down a peg or two. He retains the scene with the Artilleryman - but doesn't know where to put it. When it occurs, the movie seems to grind to a halt for 20 minutes. To compensate, he adds another big action sequence (not in the book or in Pal's movie) but, as other reviewers have pointed out, this turns his Everyman into just another action hero.Following the escape from this peril Ray Ferrier and his daughter trudge on to Boston. As they do so, it slowly dawns on them that the Martians are all dying. Finally, they arrive at the parent's house and we get the emotional climax where Ferrier redeems himself in his wife's eyes by restoring her daughter to her.This all falls a bit flat, because Spielberg has staggered his big action climax, the resolution of the plot and the emotional climax over about fifteen minutes. The movie just seems to peter out. Pal was more successful at orchestrating these three elements so his movie doesn't have the same sense of anticlimax.I feel Spielberg's movie was just made too quickly. It needed time to iron out the problems in the screenplay. Despite these reservations, Spielberg's movie captures the spirit of the book much better than Pal's version. Overall, it is not quite as successful, but is good enough on its own terms.It is no classic, but no turkey either.",7,0,2,4 July 2006
