The Avengers," Marvel superhero masterpiece
","One simple word AMAZING. everything from past MARVEL movies since Iron Man have led up to this great crossover movie with great heroes such as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk and others. The story is epic, suspenseful and fun. The action sequences are thrilling and well done with great cg integrated with live action. The characters are great abound with great acting from great actors like Robert Downey, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johanson, and Samuel Jackson. What else can you expect from great writer/director Joss Whedon creator of Buffy and Angel. Even if you are not a fan of comic books, go see this movie as a excellent way to kick off summer vacation. 10 out of 10 stars",Null,5,9,26 August 2012
Mission: Impossible III," Huge improvement over 'M:I 2', returning to the roots
","(Review in preparation for Rogue Nation) Ethan Hunt is now in semi retirement training new recruits and getting ready to marry his fiancé Julia Meade who is (naturally) completely unaware of his job as a spy. While at a party he receives an off the books mission to rescue an agent Lindsey Farris who was surveying an arms dealer named Owen Davian.Compared with 'M:I 2', this is a much better film that returns to the roots of what the series is all about while making things more personal for our main protagonist. The director this time is J.J. Abrams and in his feature film debut he breaths life into the franchise again and pays respect to the source material; focusing more on the team cloak and dagger dynamic of the franchise, injected with high octane summer action. Tom Cruise is great as always and he gives a much more vulnerable and human performance as Ethan Hunt. Ving Rhames once again comes back as Luther Stickell and he is given much more to do in this film than in the last one. The dialogue he shares with Tom Cruise gives you the sense that these two have been friends for a long time and I've always liked the banter about how marriage doesn't go with these agent's line of work. Michelle Monaghan is Ethan's wife and she does a good job of playing the innocent civilian unaware of her spouse's true line of work. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman easily gives his best performance as Owen Davian who is one of the best villains of the series. He plays the character as completely ruthless and he has one of the best lines that pushes our hero over the edge. Laurence Fishburne is great as Ethan's boss in the film and Simon Pegg has a small role as Benji Dunn who offers insight on the 'Rabbit's Foot' and some drool humor.(Pegg would reprise the role in the next film as a field agent.)Huge improvement over the previous film and a fun summer action film 9/10",Null,0,0,31 July 2015
Captain Phillips," Tense and Powerful Thriller
","'Captain Phillips' follows the story of the 2009 hijacking of the Maersk Alabama by Somalian pirates and the kidnapping of its captain. Its a very simple story but its one of the best movies that Paul Greengrass has ever made along with his great two 'Bourne' movies. The action and suspense is incredibly tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final climax of the movie.Tom Hanks gives one of his best performances as the everyman Richard Phillips. Hanks gives the character such emotional intensity that by the time the movie is over you might just be as in tears as he is. But the standout performance is newcomer Barkhad Abdi as the lead pirate Muse. Abdi portrays Muse not as a stereotypical villain but as a naive man who's very desperate to get what he wants so that he can leave his life of destitution far behind him. You cant help but feel some sympathy for him since you get the idea of what his situation and life is like early on in the movie. Hanks and Abdi play off each other very well and share some poignant scenes together especially towards the end of the movie.Greengrass's trademark shaky cam is used to very great effect without disorienting or confusing the viewer during the action scenes. He keeps things incredibly tense and when the movie slows down, the camera focuses on some powerful acting.I highly recommend this movie because it is just that good and I would definitely rate it as one of the best movies of 2013.",Null,0,1,22 January 2014
Gravity," Shows that space can be both beautiful and scary
","I just went to go see this movie today and I have to say that I was blown away by it. I was expecting what I saw in the trailers but instead I saw something totally great and suspenseful. When I saw the beautiful CG opening shot of the Earth and the space shuttle in space I was hooked. Granted it starts off slow but once the real meat starts its a non stop roller coaster ride in space. I wouldn't even call this a science fiction movie because the things depicted in this film can happen in real life right now.The beauty of this film is that it depicts space in the most realistic way that it can and that also the weight of the film lies on the shoulders of only two actors: George Clooney and Sandra Bullock. The special effects used for the space scenes are some of the best that I have seen in recent memory and out in space there is no sound except for muffled noises which adds to the realism. The cinematography is used to great effect with a lot of first person view shots which adds to the tension. The acting for the most part is great but Sandra Bullock gives an excellent performance as Ryan who gets stuck up in space with almost no way to get back down. When she acts you pretty much feel for her character.As I said before the movie starts off slow but once disaster strikes the pace picks up and almost never lets up and Cuaron's deft directing hand makes 'Gravity' tense, suspenseful and just plain beautiful due to the fantastically directed space scenes.(Couldn't expect anything less from the guy who directed 'Harry Potter 3' and 'Children of Men) (Easily one of the year's best films in my opinion.)",Null,5,9,20 October 2013
The Hunger Games," The Beginning Of the Next Teen Film Franchise
","In my original review of the hunger games, I said that it was a good movie and nothing special but after reading the source material and watching the film twice, I find it to be an ambitious and thought provoking film especially for the YA genre. As for the BA ripoff comments that people say, it is similar to BA in premise but thats where the comparisons end. It has more in common with 'The Running Man' not that its a bad thing. The plot is this: In the future North America no longer exists and is now called Panem which is separated into 13 Districts and the main Capitol but District 13 rebelled against the totalitarian government and as a result it was destroyed. As punishment to other Districts, The Hunger Games (which involves sending teenage boys and girls to kill each other and the last one standing wins) was formed to prevent other future rebellions.Our main character is Katniss Everdeen played by Winter Bone's Jennifer Lawrence who willingly volunteers to take her young sisters place in the hunger games after she is chosen. After viewing the film a second time after I read the book, I noticed that the movie was surprisingly faithful to the novel with minor changes and additions which make the story more interesting and emotional. The casting is great with the best being Jennifer Lawrence who manages to capture the book's Katniss Everdeen very closely. Not to mention, she's a more interesting and compelling character than Kristen Stewart's bland Bella Swan from the Twilight movies.Gary Ross's direction is great with introductions and building tension in the first half then exploding with fast paced editing and action in the second half. I'd say that The Hunger Games is a good movie franchise off to a great start. For those who are tired of Twilight see this but be warned. Despite the fact that this film is rated PG-13, it still has teenagers killing each other and is not for the feint of heart. 8 out of 10 stars",Null,2,6,26 August 2012
The Terminator," One of the most iconic and greatest science fiction movies of the 80s
","Often touted as one of the most influential and greatest science fiction movies of all time, 'The Terminator' still holds up very well after 30 years, 3 sequels (one of which is one of the greatest action movies of all time and one of my favorites), a TV show and much more.The story is classic science fiction involving a robotic assassin sent back through time to kill the mother (Sarah Connor) of the future human resistance before he's conceived. Following the terminator is a member of the resistance sent to protect Sarah and ensure her survival. Its the classic story of the battle between good and evil but its much more than that. Its also a coming of age story of direction-less young woman and how she gains the courage and resolve to face the unknown future. Also the film serves as a metaphor of what happens when our own creations turn against us namely the machines. Of course stories like this are cliché at this point but 'The Terminator' handles it very tastefully which helps keep it fresh.The performances are nothing short of remarkable, especially the iconic performance by Arnold Schwarzenegger as the relentless, unstoppable killing machine which jump started his career as an action movie star. The guy was perfect for the role with his build and robotic tone of voice; even his iconic line 'I'll be back'. Linda Hamilton in an early role gives a believable performance as the direction-less Sarah who's character goes through a great arc. Michael Biehn is also great as Kyle Reese, the man sent back to protect Sarah.The special effects in this film show their age but considering the nearly 7 million dollar budget and the fact that CG wasn't even around yet, I'm willing to let that pass. Besides, there's some really great camera-work and editing in this film. For instance, when Sarah is at a night club at one point in the movie both the Terminator and Kyle are there looking for her and when the terminator sees her, the action slows down in motion and the music in the club is replaced by the threatening terminator sound which intensifies the scene. And the soundtrack which is 80s synthesized music also dates the movie but the original 'Terminator' theme is still iconic because when you listen closely it sounds like a metallic heartbeat but I digress.Because of the success of this film, James Cameron went on the map as a filmmaker and went on to make other great films including his own sequel that surpassed the original in so many ways. But if it weren't for the success of this film we wouldn't have 'Terminator 2:Judgement Day'.",Null,1,2,13 April 2014
The Expendables," Cool action movie homage
","'The Expendables' is a nice little movie that unites an ensemble cast of old school action stars of the past few decades. Names like Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren and then some show up.This movie has all the ingredients to make an action movie: tough and bad ass macho men as our main leads who hardly take a bullet, cool and exiting action that never lets up, exotic locations and more emphasis on action than on plot and character just like an old school 80s action movie.The plot is pretty cliché and all the characters are one dimensional stereotypes not to mention some of the motives don't make sense especially towards the climax but in the end its a lot of fun watching old school action stars still kicking ass after the 80s have been over with for a long time.",Null,0,4,24 January 2013
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The best M:I film yet
","Out of all the films that have come out this summer 'Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation' has been the most hyped up film and early reviews by professional critics have said that this is a great film and the best to come out since the franchise's resurgence. Being a fan since I saw the first film when I was younger, it's easy to be skeptical that the film is really over-hyped and not as great as they make it out to be. Fortunately, I went into the film opening day with high expectations and got exactly what I wanted and more. I can safely say that 'M:I Rogue Nation' is the best installment out of the entire 'M:I' series to date and even better than 'Ghost Protocol'!Watching this film from the get go you know that this will be an intense and fun ride when the film opens up with one of the most hyped up images this summer of Tom Cruise hanging for dear life outside of an airplane. Watching that scene is heart pounding and intense especially knowing that once again Cruise performed that impossible stunt himself. (No pun intended) The guy can do no wrong when it comes to performing his own stunt work. But that is only the tip of what's to come as there are many other action sequences that employ excellent stunt work that live up to the franchise name of 'Impossible'; each of which are high octane action. In this film Ethan Hunt is tracking down the mysterious Syndicate and its leader Solomon Lane played by Sean Harris. Meanwhile, the CIA is questioning Ethan's sanity and his motives and whether or not the IMF should be permanently disavowed. Throughout the film, Ethan is working with Ilsa Faust played brilliantly by Rebecca Ferguson who we don't know if she is on Ethan's side or not and has ulterior motives. Most of the cast from the previous film reprise their roles along with Ving Rhames as Luther from the first three films. Simon Pegg is back and he has a much bigger role this time and his comic timing is great as always. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames share some great scenes together to bridge the gap between the old vs the new.What even makes this film better than 'Ghost Protocol' is the villain Solomon Lane. In 'Ghost Protocol', we had Cobalt who had very little screen time or depth and was a very generic villain. But in 'Rogue Nation', we have Solomon Lane who is very menacing, intimidating, has dimension to his character and is performed excellently by Harris. (A hero is not as good without a good villain.)Christopher McQuarrie's direction in this film combines suspenseful spy thriller with high octane on-the-edge-of-your-seat action scenes.I had a fun time with this film and is not only the best 'M:I' film yet but one of the best films of 2015. 10/10 See it!",Null,1,4,1 August 2015
Avengers: Endgame," An epic conclusion that brings everything over the last decade full circle
","So I just got back from the midnight premiere of 'Avengers: Endgame' and boy, I can not tell anyone enough just how epic and grand this movie was. It makes all the other Marvel movies over the last decade incredibly worth it, and brings the story that began all the way back in 2008 with 'Iron Man' full circle. I can confidently say that this movie is even better than 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'. And this is coming from a guy who attended the midnight double feature premiere of 'Deathly Hallows' on July 15, 2011.'Endgame' is just an epic, fun, and exciting film filled with fantastic action sequences, funny humor to lighten the mood, and excellent drama between the Avengers characters that audiences have come to know and love over the last decade. The acting is just phenomenal with everyone getting their chances to shine and my hat goes to Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark who arguably gives the best performance of the film and possibly the best out of the entire franchise. He just embodied the character of Iron Man with his quirky mannerisms and traits. He puts his heart and soul into the character that he is the character. The film is probably the most emotionally gripping out of all the Marvel movies and bonus points for extra emotion go to audiences like myself who have been watching these movies since the first 'Iron Man'. I can not explain enough just how amazing this film is and it serves as the perfect conclusion to the Avengers series. At the same time, I am kind of sad to see what I've come to know and love come to an end. But good things eventually do have to come to an end at some point.",Null,1,3,26 April 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," One of the best installments in the series
","(Re-review in preparation for Rogue Nation)After a bomb destroys the Kremlin during a mission, 'Ghost Protocol' is initiated which disavows the IMF and puts Ethan Hunt and his team on the run. His mission; should he choose to accept it is to stop the real culprit codenamed Cobalt who is on an extremist mission to destroy the world in the name of peace.'Ghost Protocol' is the first 'M:I' film to include a title rather than a number to mark its place in the series and boy is it one excellent movie. Everything about this film is fantastic: the action, the team dynamics, the set pieces and even the humor! In fact, 'GP' has probably the most humor out of all the 'M:I' films despite the stakes being so high and that's fine because humor doesn't hurt during an action sequence as long as it's done right. While the plot of a villain trying to destroy the world is cliché, it's the execution that makes the film so great. What's even greater is the fact that not everything goes to plan for the IMF in this film and their gadgets don't always work; adding tension to the action scenes.The cast does an excellent job with their roles. Each with their own unique personalities. Tom Cruise still proves that he's an action star and the sequence of him climbing the Burj Khalifa is one of the best parts of the film. He shows how much of a leader he has become since the first film. Jeremy Renner before he was on 'The Avengers' is an analyst with a dark secret. He shares some great banter and quiet drama moments with the team. Paula Patton is a beautiful and capable agent with a score to settle. Simon Pegg reprises his role as Benji from 'M:I 3' and he makes a great replacement to Ving Rhames as the computer expert and comic relief. His comic timing is impeccable. Animation auteur Brad Bird directs this film as his first live action feature. Much like J.J. Abrams before him, he breaths fresh life into the franchise. The cinematography is beautiful and the action sequences are breathtaking and pulse pounding.The only weak link to the film is the villain Cobalt played by Michael Nyqvist. Nyqvist's performance is good but his screen time is minimal and he has little personality or depth other than that of a generic extremist. But this is only a minor nitpick since the rest of the film overshadows this flaw.A great spy action thriller and one of the best installments in the series. 9/10",Null,4,6,26 August 2012
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Miyazaki's first epic masterpiece
","'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind' is often considered to be the first Studio Ghibli film. Technically 'Castle in the Sky' released two years later was the first Ghibli film. But 'Nausicaa' might has well have been the first Ghibli film, because it contains all the traits that both Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki are most well known for and had this film not been a success with audiences and critics, then Studio Ghibli never would have existed.'Nausicaa' was Miyazaki's 2nd film as a director and it was at this point that he had fully developed his craft and his traits as a filmmaker. The film is beautiful to look at filled with imaginative and creative ideas of a dystopian future and the people that exist within it. Environmentalism and anti-war themes feature heavily into the plot and it balances out nicely, never feeling too preachy unlike some Hollywood films and actually enhancing the plot. Even after more than 30 years since it's original release, the film holds up very nicely with its intriguing plot and likeable characters. Nausicaa herself makes for a strong leading female character, something that Miyazaki did quite often in his films. She has a very likeable personality and is a pacifist at heart but only turns to violence when pushed too far. There are some nice side characters too, my favorite probably being Lord Yuppa, an old badass swordsman who ocassionaly helps Nausicaa. Yuppa is voiced by the ever fantastic Patrick Stewart in the English dub of the film and his performance is probably the best and most memorable in the film. The rest of the dub is great too and of high quality compared with the bad 'Warriors of the Wind' release back in the 80s.The villains in the film are not one dimensional unlike some older Disney films and have understandable motives even if you don't agree with them.'Nausicaa' was the first collaboration between Hayao Miyazaki and composer Joe Hisaishi who would continue to work with Miyazaki for decades. The music goes incredibly well with the visuals and contains one of the better openings to a film I have ever seen, animated or otherwise.'Nausicaa' is an absolute epic masterpiece by the great Miyazaki. The film just draws you into its intriguing dystopian world with its beautiful visuals and epic story that only Miyazaki could create.",Null,0,1,15 January 2019
Transformers," A flawed but entertaining and fun summer sci-fi action flick
","7 years ago this movie completely blew me away. Everything about this movie was just awesome. The action was intense, the special effects were incredible and still looks great to this day. And the acting was so well done between the robots and the human characters that I almost believed that the Autobots and Deceptions were real. It was even because of this movie that I was formerly introduced to the 'Transformers' franchise. Of course after exposure to other incarnations, multiple viewings and other better movies, it's not as perfect as I thought it was but it's still a fun and spectacular special effects extravaganza.The first live action Transformers movie is about the ongoing war between the Autobots and Decepticons and how they bring their war to Earth looking for the Allspark cube and get us in the crossfire including a young teenager Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), his crush Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), a military unit and various other characters.Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox as Sam and Mikaela respectively make for good likable leads. 'Transformers' was the breakout role for both of them especially more so for Megan Fox since it launched her career as a movie actress and sex symbol. She played a good role since her character was rough, gritty, street-smart and incredibly gorgeous to boot. Shia also did well here too as the awkward and geeky teenager looking for a car so that he can impress the girl. He delivered some good lines including the classic 'I bought a car' line and had some good chemistry with Megan. Other mainstream actors like Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, Jon Voight, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and John Turturro were here but the most memorable was Turturro as the federal agent Simmons from Sector 7. Turturro brought a lot of good humor to the series since he knew what he was working with. But the biggest icing on the cake was bringing the original Optimus Prime 'Peter Cullen' back to voice the character since he had the commanding and noble voice that defined Optimus. As for Megatron, Hugo Weaving came in and he did a great job for the most part giving Megatron that sinister and menacing voice that Frank Welker originally gave even though his role in this movie was short. (Trivia: Welker couldn't come back to voice the character since Michael Bay thought that his current voice didn't fit but I've recently watched the newer TV series 'Transformers: Prime' and Welker reprised the role there and he was just as good as he was in the original show even though he sounded much older.) So I don't completely understand why he couldn't come back but that's a nitpick and Weaving still did a great job.Even after seven years the special effects and action scenes still pack an incredible punch and considering that most of the effects were done by Industrial Light and Magic it shouldn't be a surprise. And while Michael Bay is pretty infamous for making high octane popcorn films with fast edits and stylistic visuals, he was a 'decent' choice for directing this trilogy but with one criticism and it's the most clichÃ© thing to say now since everyone else before me has said it but I'm still going to say it anyways. (The human characters overshadow the Transformers themselves in their own movie trilogy.) Because of this, character development from most of the Autobots and Decepticons is minimal to none with most fan favorites reduced to cameo roles. And unless if you are at least familiar with the other incarnations including the G1 series from the 80s, you might not get some of the references or know the relationships with one another. Even the script is questionable at times with the robots doing things out of character like Optimus Prime saying 'Oops' or 'Sorry my bad' after accidentally trampling a backyard water fountain and a small garden or even Bumblebee urinating on Simmons when he refuses to talk. (I'm not kidding, he actually does that in the movie.)(These are more personal nitpicks because I like the 'Transformers' franchise and like other fans I'd like the characters to be more faithful to their original incarnations, much like the reboot of 'Star Trek' which modernized the franchise but remained faithful to the original series but I'm going off topic.)That all being said, 'Transformers' is a flawed but entertaining and fun summer sci-fi action flick that I still enjoy to watch every now and then.",Null,1,1,25 April 2014
Mission: Impossible II," Decent summer action film, bad 'M:I' movie
","(Review in preparation for Rogue Nation) It is a few years after the events of the first film and while Ethan Hunt is on holiday, he receives an assignment to recover a stolen virus called Chimera and recruit a third team member who had a prior relationship with the man who stole the virus; a rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose.Out of all of the 'M:I' films, this one is probably the most divisive and my least favorite of the series. I used to like this when I was younger and I don't think its one of the worst movies ever made but having grown up watching the original 'M:I' TV series and other films after this one it feels weaker and it strays too far from what 'Mission: Impossible' is supposed to be.Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt and in this one he sports a longer haircut and wears dark sunglasses during the action sequences. His performance comes across more like a James Bond type of character than the one from the previous film. Ving Rhames is back from the previous film but isn't given much to do. New cast is Thandie Newton, Dougray Scott, John Polson and Brendan Gleeson who all give good performances but Dougray Scott gets my pick as one of the weaker villains of the series since his character is just a rehash of the one from the previous film, just more younger and sadistic.In the directors chair this time is Hong Kong action director John Woo who's highly stylized and hip take makes 'M:I 2' feel more like a generic action film than 'M:I'. The action sequences are exciting but overblown with the over usage of slow-mo.The weakest installment of the series but a decent action film. 6/10",Null,0,1,31 July 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," Mankind's evolution and journey into the unknown
","What more can I say about this film that hasn't been said by everyone else. Most cinema fans already know about this film or have at least heard of it. No doubt its one of the most famous and influential science fiction films of all time not to mention one of the most unique due to its unconventional storytelling, use of classical music in space scenes, realism in space travel and groundbreaking special effects that still hold up very well. Yet despite all that when I first watched this movie when I was in my early teens I hated it mostly because I was expecting something similar to 'Star Wars'. Instead what I got was a slow moving art house science fiction film with hardly any dialog and mostly visuals with little to no action. As I've gotten older I've come to appreciate this fascinating film since my taste in movies has changed a lot since I was a kid.If there was any way to describe this movie it would have to be a 'journey of evolution'. Think about it. When you watch this film you're simply watching the evolution of humans into the people we are today and beyond. In the beginning of the film primitive human ancestors discover an alien object called the 'Monolith' which causes them to evolve to a point where they can make the first weapon and kill in order to survive. In a famous flash cut from the simple bone to a complex satellite millions of years later we have evolved to a point where we can leave Earth and explore outer space and the moon. Computers have also evolved into complex AI's that can feel most notably HAL 9000. The rest of the film focuses on the journey into the unknown which we nor our main character can comprehend. Science fiction has always been used as an allegory for the human condition. 'Where do we come from? Where are we going? What will we encounter when we get there?' are questions that '2001' asks us but leaves open to interpretation by the time that the movie is finished.For its time the special effects were groundbreaking in that it gave us a realistic view of what space travel might look like.(This was before Neil Armstrong landed on the moon.) Not to mention the famous 'Stargate' sequence that is a beautiful but creepy sequence of colors and scenery. Music was also used to great effect to represent the serenity and calmness of traveling through space or the creepy and scariness of the unknown. As for acting its good but the standout is Douglas Rain as HAL 9000 who gives him a creepy tone of voice that matches perfectly with the red electronic eye making him one of the most iconic science fiction movie characters of all time.As I said before this is a slow movie and there is very little dialog so unless you are into science fiction films about the philosophical and the journey into the unknown you might be bored due to the lack of action. Its worth it to watch this movie at least once to understand its influence and impact on the science fiction genre and how it begged the question of what might happen if we journey into the unknown.",Null,0,3,10 August 2013
The Artist," Love Letter to Silent Cinema
","Now this is a masterpiece. Surprising to say since its a modern black and white movie without sound. Most modern movie audiences would be put off by movies like this but what makes this work is the simplicity in its story and how it pays homage to the nearly forgotten film style of silent filmmaking. This is more or less love letter to hardcore fans of cinema and serves as a reminder to why we watch movies in the first place.The story is the simple but classic story of out with the old and in with the new. Its the late 1920s and the era of silent films comes to a close with the advent new style of film called the 'Talkie' and a silent movie star faces the end of his career when he cant adapt to the new form of art.French actor Jean Dujardin gives a fantastic performance without speaking a single word. Most acting nowadays doesn't involve emoting but Jean proves that acting can still be powerful without talking. His co star Berenice Bejo does just as great, not to mention shes beautiful as Peppy Miller who becomes a talkie movie star.The camera-work is fantastic old school and really looks like that it was filmed in the 1920s. The set design, costumes and cars all feel authentic to the time period making this a period piece. The music is just great and very emotional at times just matching the feel of every scene.I highly recommend this film to anybody who loves cinema. Just go into this with an open mind and don't be discouraged because its silent and black and white. Id say that this film is worthy of owning but thats me. 10 out of 10 stars",Null,4,7,26 August 2012
Mission: Impossible," The first M:I is still a great film
","(This is my first film review in a while and I thought it would be great to review the Mission: Impossible films in preparation for Rogue Nation) When a mission in Prague goes sour which results in the death of an entire IMF team leaving only one survivor named Ethan Hunt who framed as a mole and subsequently disavowed from his organization. In order to discover who the mole is and clear his name he must strike a bargain with the mole's reclusive employer Max and form a team to conduct a huge heist.Looking back on the first 'Mission: Impossible' film or 'M:I' for short, it is amazing how well that this still holds up as not only a great 'M:I' film but a great spy film as well. In the past many people have said that the plot to this film is either convoluted or hard to follow. This is true to some extent but that is only if you are not paying attention and it is great that a summer blockbuster requires you to think. I've watched this film many times over the years and I've enjoyed it for its great plot, atmosphere, suspenseful sequences that live up to the franchise name 'Impossible' and good acting by the entire cast including Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Béart, Henry Czerny, Jean Reno, Ving Rhames and Vanessa Redgrave. Tom Cruise's charismatic performance a Ethan Hunt proved that he could carry an action film and the fact that he does his own stunts makes the action sequences all the more engaging. The rest of the cast does a great job with their roles.U2's updated take on the classic theme song is still great and catchy. The director is Brian De Palma and he understands how to put suspense and atmosphere into a spy film. Many sequences are directed with refined style. One sequence in particular is the best and iconic part of the film where Tom Cruise is hanging from a wire. The combination of acting, music, camera work, sound mixing and camera work easily make this (in my opinion) one of the best suspense sequences put onto film. The rest of the film is great cloak and dagger intrigue with good plot twists. 9/10",Null,0,0,29 July 2015

",Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece. The plot is aired out of sequence and chronicles the lives of criminals over a period of a few days. The humor is dark but incredibly funny especially Samuel Jackon's infamous 'what' scene or 'I Just Shot Marvin In the Face'. A star studded ensemble cast with great performances all around. This is definitely an art house film which means that this film wont be for the casual viewer like his previous film. Like 'Resevior Dogs' this film has strong graphic violence and constant strong language enough to make this an NC-17 instead of an R but still one of my favorites.

","Halloween night is a night of spooks, scares, and fun. It is also a great night to watch John Carpenter's masterpiece of terror. Interesting enough since it takes place on the same night adding atmosphere and suspense.'Halloween' is probably one of the greatest horror films of all time and what makes it work so well is that it relies on suspense and atmosphere in order to scare the audience instead of blood and gore like most modern horror films do. In a way this could very be the spiritual successor to Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' since it takes many inspirations from that film. The classic story of a deranged mental patient escaping from a mental institution and then stalking teenagers on Halloween night has still managed to retain it's scares and tension even nearly four decades later. The film has been so influential that it popularized the slasher genre and gave rise to imitators throughout the 80s and beyond. While some of the imitators are mildly entertaining, none of them compare to Carpenter's classic film.Carpenter's direction is superb as it creates an eerie mood. The usage of a piano melody is iconic since it is simple and very effective at generating scares especially whenever the killer is on screen. The usage of lighting rather than blood and gore is very effective at creating an unsettling atmosphere for the film which is something that few horror films duplicate nowadays. It does a great job at making a feeling of uncertainty as we never know when Michael Myers is going to pop up on screen and kill someone.The acting is great across the board. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a good early performance as Laurie Strode. It is because of this performance that she is known as 'the' scream queen. But it is Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis who steals the show whenever he is on screen. Loomis is probably one of the best characters in a horror film since he knows what Myers is capable of but few people take him seriously and he has to take matters into his own hands. The rest of the cast is serviceable at best especially the other teen characters which only serve to be victims of the killer. Nick Castle as Micheal Myers is excellent as he is a very imposing and intimidating figure. He never speaks and only breathes very heavily. He comes across as more of a supernatural figure than a person and that makes him all the more terrifying.'Halloween' is a classic and a must see for horror fans. It created an iconic villain in the form of Micheal Myers and popularized an entire genre of film which has since become cliché. But the original film still remains terrifying thanks to Carpenter's excellent direction and usage of atmosphere. Its a great film to watch on Halloween night.",Null,0,1,10 October 2017
Blade Runner," Sci-Fi noir classic
","Of all the science fiction movies that came out in the 80s from George Lucas's Star Wars to Robert Zenekis's Back to the Future, this one seems to be of the more talked about, high rated and influential. Even 30 years after its initial release you can still feel its influence in most science fiction films to this day. The story is adapted from Philp Dick's novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep and it is a very loose adaptation with events and characters from the novel either changed or omitted but the film takes a creative approach to the novel giving it an art-house feel. Unfortunately most modern audiences who haven't read the book or seen the movie for the first time might be bored by its slow pacing and lack of action since it was advertised as a sci-fi action film.In order to appreciate this film you have to understand the time period in which it was released. Back in the 80s sci-fi was at its peak with releases such as The Empire Strikes Back, Star Trek The Wrath of Khan, and E.T which were all box office hits at the movies with their fantasy and adventure approaches to their stories. Blade Runner on the other hand had a more unique approach with its dark and depressing depiction of the future L.A., pollution, overpopulation and Eastern culture influences with a touch of noir mixed with philosophy, a noir narration spoken by Harrison Ford and an atmospheric soundtrack by Vangelis. Not to mention Ford playing a dark anti-hero role rather than the big screen hero role that most audiences associated him with. All this led to its failure at the box office and it wouldn't be heard from again until its revival in 1993 with the release of a directors cut which the director Ridley Scott was not involved that omitted the narration and changed the ending which led to its popularity with cult audiences. In 2007 Ridley Scott returned to Blade Runner and added some clean up to the movie, added a few extra scenes and minimal CG to create his definitive edition of Blade Runner.The performances in this movie are great with Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer as the standouts. The production and setting design is well done giving it a great and unique noir atmosphere which has been highly influential in most science fiction movies since then. And the action scenes are great and intense even emotional at times. As for story its both hit and miss. Its got a great and thought provoking premise and a great setting to put it in but some of the characters are underdeveloped but maybe they are supposed to be that way because of the ideas that the movie presents to the viewer of the differences between emotional man and unemotional synthetic human and what it means to be human.Its a great movie but not for casual audiences who want fast paced action and adventure. Since there are multiple versions of the movie go for the Final Cut for the better experience. 9 out of 10 stars. Despite this films flaws. I never get bored with this film no matter how many times I watch it. It's that good but that's just me. You have to figure out for yourself if this is a great film or not.",Null,1,4,14 August 2012
Rear Window," Hitchcock's Voyeuristic Masterpice
","How do you take a simple story that remains in one place for the duration of the movie, never leaves the room and only looks outside into the neighborhood without leaving whilst still remaining suspenseful? You get Alfred Hitchcock as director and you get Rear Window.It follows the story of a wheelchair bound photographer played by Jimmy Stewart who starts to suspect that his neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) across from his apartment has committed murder. Through the story he gets the help of his beautiful girlfriend (played by Grace Kelly) and his nurse (played by Thelma Ritter) to solve the mystery.They don't call him 'Master of Suspense' for nothing. Hitchcock takes his audience on a journey of voyeurism through a tiny neighborhood that was built on one set. Whatever Jimmy Stewart sees in his neighborhood the audience sees because the movie makes us voyeurs just like he is. Most of the camera work and cinematography involves panning and tilting inside the neighborhood without ever entering any of the other apartments hence the theme of voyeurism. When its not looking outside it stays in the one apartment that Jimmy Stewart always stays in. In most movies this idea would be boring because not much would happen but with Hitchcock at the helm and great writing by both John Michael Hayes and Cornell Woolrich, you get a fantastic suspenseful film.Performance wise, everyones great all around. Jimmy Stewart is great as Jefferies (the wheel chair bound photographer). Grace Kelly is great as Jefferies girlfriend who uses her intuition to help solve the mystery. Thelma Ritter is great as the down to earth nurse and Raymond Burr is great as the mysterious neighbor Thorwald.For a movie thats nearly 60 years old it has that timeless quality to it making it all the more better as a classic and one of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies. 10 out of 10 stars.",Null,0,1,19 September 2012
The Matrix," Happy 20th Anniversary to one of the most epic science fiction films of all time
","Today marks the 20th Anniversary to the The Wachowskis epic masterpiece 'The Matrix' and I just got done watching my midnight showing in 4K HDR and I have to say that watching it like this is like watching the film for the very first time 20 years ago today. I was too young to have seen this in the movie theaters back in the day and didn't watch it fully until I was older. Now it is one of my favorite films of all time.What is the Matrix?That is the question literal office drone Thomas 'Neo' Anderson is asking when he questions his reality. He finds out the answer the hard way when he discovers that his reality is a lie, nothing more than a computer generated dreamworld known only as The Matrix, designed by a race of machines in order to keep what's left of humanity under control and to serve as a power source. When he learns the truth, he follows his destiny as 'The One', the one human who would show humanity the truth and free them from the machines grasp.'The Matrix' is one of the most innovative films of the last two decades and it holds up beautifully unlike some other films released in 1999. The film was highly innovative for its slow motion action sequences, kung fu and a special effect known as bullet time where you see a bullet flying through the air in slow motion even leaving behind a ripple effect. While action and special effects hold up nicely, the thought provoking story adds more icing to the cake. The story involves philosophy, noir, religion and the very nature of humanity. It asks the audience questions and it does it in a very smart way under the guise of a summer action blockbuster. Most action movies are dumb mindless fun, but not 'The Matrix'.The acting is great across the board. Keanu Reeves is stoic as Neo but he does a great job of pulling off the role. Everyone else is fantastic from Laurence Fishburne as Neo's mentor to Carrie-Anne Moss as Neo's love interest and action girl. But the best performance goes to Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. Weaving is menacing and calculating in the role. He plays as a villain that you absolutely love to hate but can still understand.'The Matrix' is a film that comes as close to perfection as possible. There are minor flaws and possible plot holes but the film is so well crafted and immersive that those flaws aren't substantial enough to tamper with ones experience when watching this film.This film is quite possibly one of the best science fiction films ever made on par with the original 'Star Wars' from 1977. Even if you haven't seen it, please by all means watch it at least once in your life.All I can say now is Happy 20th Anniversary to 'The Matrix' and thank you to the The Wachowskis for making this epic masterpiece and allowing it to endure.",Null,1,1,31 March 2019
Godzilla," Solid reboot for one of the most iconic movie monsters of all time
","I just recently got out of the movie theaters seeing 'Godzilla' and for the most part, I thought it was good. It managed to bring another dead franchise back to life after the 1998 'Godzilla' supposedly killed it.Its got great action and really detailed special effects (the ones we expect from high budget CG movies nowadays) on the monsters especially Godzilla himself even though his screen time is limited and overshadowed by the human characters in the film and the main monster villains: the MUTOs . But when he does appear on screen, the whole thing becomes really intense and heart pounding. The way that everything is shot builds up the suspense to reveal the monsters much like 'Jaws' did in 1975 and Gareth Edwards understands this.The movie has some nice touches that pay homage to the original 1954 classic. One of the characters is named Serizawa after the original one who played an important role in the original film. Godzilla is portrayed as a destructive force of nature although he becomes ambiguously heroic by the end of the film. The tone is very dark much like the original film with very little camp. The cast is okay; Aaron Taylor-Johnson gives a good performance as the main protagonist but his character is bland compared with Bryan Cranston who plays his dad(who unfortunately is killed off not even halfway through the movie). Ken Watanabe adds a nice touch as Dr. Serizawa and he's always great in a lot of the roles he plays.'Godzilla' is a solid franchise reboot that modernizes one of the most iconic movie monsters of all time for newer audiences. It has its problems but the good outweighs the negative and it manages to be an entertaining monster flick.",Null,2,6,22 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Sci-Fi fantasy classic and a childhood favorite
","In 1977 'Star Wars A New Hope' formerly just called 'Star Wars' was released in the movie theaters and cinema was never the same since then. To this day 'Star Wars' remains not just a classic but an experience for generations of moviegoers. If I had to pick which movie trilogy that truly introduced me to cinema it would be the original 'Star Wars' trilogy.(Granted it was the 'Special Editions' I grew up watching in the 90s but I think that the theatrical cuts are better because it shows all the hard work they did without CG.) So in a way I'm thankful that I watched this movie and that the original trilogy opened my eyes to movies.The original 'Star Wars' is an epic yet simplistic story of Good vrs Evil influenced by Joseph Cambell's hero mythology and others like Akira Kurosawa films and Flash Gordon serials. The story should be familiar to everyone by now since its part of our pop culture.(But if you have never seen it, GO SEE IT. Watch the trilogy and share it with family and friends because it has something for everyone.) With the exception of Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin and Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan 'Ben' Kenobi who were already well established actors, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia were unknown actors that became household names because of the popularity of this movie and everyone plays their parts well. Anthony Daniels is a robot named C-3PO, Kenny Baker plays as R2-D2 and Peter Mayhew is the Wookiee Chewbacca. Lets not forget the most iconic character that has embedded into cinema history as one of the best movie villains ever Darth Vader played by David Prowse and voiced menacingly by the great James Earl Jones.When you watch the theatrical cuts you have to appreciate how groundbreaking the special effects were at the time since they were creating new technology for effects while filming. Everything was done using models and props and it all still holds up very well. The soundtrack just screams epic since its done by John Williams. As for writing and dialog ask anybody if they have never heard of 'May The Force Be With You' and you'll get the picture.George Lucas made a masterpiece for the modern age. Its just a shame he wont re-release the original theatrical cuts since he claims that the newer versions are his true vision. In the end 'Star Wars' remains one of my favorite films from my childhood and an influential classic for the ages.",Null,0,0,22 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Bigger, Better and Darker Star Wars
","After the huge success of the first 'Star Wars' a sequel was inevitable and this time George Lucas stepped down and sat mostly in the producers seat and co wrote part of the script while he handed the directors reigns to his former USC professor Irvin Kershner. Unlike Lucas who was a special effects visionary, Kershner instead focuses on story and characters, most notably the human face.The story takes place most likely a few years after the first film. With the Death Star destroyed Luke and the Rebel Aliance is forced to go on the run and into hiding on a remote ice planet Hoth. Meanwhile Darth Vader does everything in his power to find Luke and bring him to his Emperor in order to train him to become the next Sith apprentice. Afterwords many things happen: Romance is formed in the middle of battle, Shocking revelations are discovered that change everything and new things are discovered about 'The Force' that are almost zen like by a new character named Yoda (performed and voiced by the great Frank Oz).Everything about this movie is phenomenal. The story takes a darker and more personal turn leading to better character development. The action scenes are amazing, epic and well shot and the dialog is so memorable that its embedded into our pop culture. Anybody who knows 'No...I am your father.' or 'I know' should know what I'm talking about.(Give some credit to George Lucas,the late Leigh Brackett(who also co-wrote the original 'The Big Sleep') and Lawrence Kasdan for delivering a great script.) As for acting its just excellent. James Earl Jones and David Prowse give their most menacing combination performance that reminds us why Darth Vader is one the most memorable villains in cinema history. Mark Hamil's Luke is angsty but a little more mature from the last movie. Carie Fisher and Harison Ford share great chemistry. Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker are great comedic relief as always giving some levity to even the most darkest of times. Frank Oz does a wonderful job as Yoda who becomes Luke's new mentor in 'The Force'. Alec Guinness returns as Obi Wan Kenobi who guides Luke to Yoda in spirit form. Billy Dee Williams stars as a new character Lando Calrissian. Elaine Baker's face and Clive Revill's voice give us a very chilling first time view of the Emperor and lets not forget the one scene wonder bounty hunter Boba Fett played by Jeremy Bullochband voiced by Jason Wingreen. (Combination performances seem to happen a lot in 'Star Wars' Hmmm) One last thing I should mention is the amazing score by John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra which gives us one of the more memorable and chilling music pieces for Darth Vader the 'Imperial March'. 'The Empire Strikes Back' stands as one of the best sequels and one of the best movies of all time. See it and share it with everyone.",Null,0,0,7 February 2013
The Godfather," One of the best movies ever made
","One of the best movies ever made. I definitely agree with that statement. Francis Ford Coppola made a masterpiece that defined what cinema is all about. Iconic quotes like 'Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse.' and performances by excellent actors make this movie.The story follows the Corleone gangster family and all the tragedies and events that change the family forever most notably Michael Corleone and his father Don Vito Corleone both played brilliantly by a very young Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in iconic performances. James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Cazale,Talia Shire and Diane Keaton also co star in memorable performances that contribute to the story.The transformation of Michael from a man who wants nothing to do with his crime family to ruthless gangster is one of the most subtle and disturbing elements of cinema. I like to think of it as the dark unconventional side of the Hero's Journey. The film is just epic in scope, spectacle and storytelling. From the well shot cinematography to the haunting score by Nino Rota to the engrossing yet tragic story, 'The Godfather' remains a timeless classic.",Null,0,1,13 January 2013
