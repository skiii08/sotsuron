First Man," Terribly slow and boring
",First of all there should be a warning about those flashing lights. I am glad that I am not epileptic. I don't believe that man landed on the moon and for me the Apollo landing was a hoax. But this did not affect my judgement. Without being an art critic I can recognise a good film with a good plot. This film was one-paced and painfully slow. A documentary of the events would have been more interesting. Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to cry and have a mental breakdown through out the film.,1,0,5,19 October 2018
