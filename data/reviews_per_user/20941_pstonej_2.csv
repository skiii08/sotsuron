Catch Me If You Can," CRAP ME IF YOU CAN
","Leonardo Dicaprio unfortunately marred and tainted his career for life by choosing to do titanic. If I had the chance to make multi-millions and be an international sex star I probably would sell out too. His performance in this along with the rest of his films is superb. Unfortanetly Tom Hanks does exactly what he always does, act poorly. He always plays tom hanks playing someone else, he's not playing the FBI agent, he's playing tom hanks as the FBI agent. Tom Hanks AS Tom Hanks AS some character. Once again, Spielberg also is merely mediocre. He has no edge nor directorial creativity and hardly does anything but tell an interesting story in a very bland way. The best part of the movie was the opening credits which was a throwback to the classic graphics of the opening credits of the 1950 (eg. anatomy of a murder) Walken plays his role quite well though. Overall, the movie was pretty mediocre but DiCaprio and Walken make it enternaining enough for for me to have stayed awake amidst the tired work of spielberg and hanks.",1,10,31,19 January 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," eh...
","Yeah, the movie was visually stunning but it was def not as good as the first one and def not the best summer sequel. I'd say the best would be X2, but I'm not posting about that. Some of the fight scenes were cool to watch but I had major issues watching it look like some of the scenes were done by PIXAR. I was also somewhat disappointed that keanu reeves did not say 'woah.' The entire film. The plot was tired, heavy-handed, pretentious and predictiable since it's all given away before they ever leave Zion; but we're not really going for the plot, are we? Furthermore, it was very closely paralleling star wars at many points and even some of the angles were the same. I wouldn't be suprised if Neo and Trinity were brother and sister.However, it was definitly worth seeing and I would def. recomend it. Overall, too hyped up for yet another hollywood sequel to a hollywood vehicle.",6,0,0,21 May 2003
