Captain Phillips," Hanks is back to his best, Abdi's debut is as good as anyones
","If you thought Pirates died out in the 1700′s and only reappeared in Jack Sparrow's adventures then your very wrong.Piracy is very much still a huge problem, so much that in 2011 there were 151 reported attacks on ships off the shores of Somalia. There is an estimated 3000-5000 operating out of Somalia. In 2009 a group of these Somali pirates boarded and attempted to hijack the MV Maersk Alabama.The film Captain Philips follows the events of the attempted hijacking of the container ship off the coast of Somalia. Tom hanks plays the captain of the ship Captain Richard Phillips. Hanks is back and back with a bang in this movie as he is simply flawless throughout. The film is filled with suspense and tells the story in such a realistic way, if you ever wanted to know what it feels like to be held hostage by terrifying Somali pirates armed with AK47′s then just watch this movie. Surprisingly the stand out performance does not come from hanks even though he is magnificent. The stand out performance comes from Barkhad Abdi. Abdi plays the leader of the pirate group. His performance is worthy the Oscar nomination its received.'Look at me, Look at me, I am the captain now'One line from a performance that will stand out for a very long time.Director Paul Greengrass as made a fantastic portrayal of this story that deserves to be told.",7,1,1,16 February 2014
Gravity," The best 3D film yet
","GravitySuch a Marmite film, you either love it or hate it, but either way its hard to not appreciate the beauty of the film from a directional perspective. Alfonso Cuaron has made a masterpiece of a film in the way that is a first of its kind. Id go as far as to say the best 3d film yet and the start of a different age for films. Its epic and beautiful and you really do feel like your their with the characters in space. What the film lacks is depth to the story line, having just two characters makes the film slightly boring in my view and I do not think bullock can carry a film on her own. At times boring and at times magnificent. I really don't want it to win the Oscar for best picture but I feel it deserves the award for Director as Alfonso Cuaron.Its a good watch and probably better seen on the big screen so you can witness the 3D brilliance.http://raroe.wordpress.com/",8,0,1,16 February 2014
Lone Survivor," As gripping as a death match on Call Of Duty
","A gripping action packed war film. The Hurt locker meets Saving Private Ryan.An high octane all action war movie, now I am not in the army and have no knowledge of what its like to be in a situation of life or death but this film seems to me the most realistic portrayal an actual war zone then most other films of the same genre in recent years. The film starts off quite slow but be patient because after half hour you wont be able to take your eyes off the screen as your thrown into the heat of battle. Its just as gripping as being in a call of duty death match. The hairs on the back of your neck will stand up as you feel the fear the soldiers are feeling as bullets reign down around them. Mark Wahlberg leads a group of four American soldiers stranded without a radio connection behind enemy lines as a mission goes wrong deep in Taliban controlled Afghanistan.This film is based on true life events, if you love war films there is no reason you wont love this one.http://raroe.wordpress.com/",7,0,2,16 February 2014
American Hustle," O. Russell nails it once again
","David O. Russell's Gimmicky Tale of crime and corruption. Set in late 70′s New Jersey, Two con artists Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser are forced into helping out on an FBI investigation lead by Richard 'Richie' DiMaso that unveils corruption and bribery at the highest level of congress and throughout the Mafia. O. Russell brings together Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence again who he worked with in his last movie 'Silver Linings Play book' hoping they can bring to this movie what they did the later and propel it on to award after award. It turns out they can, the film is receiving nomination after nomination. Pairing Cooper ad Lawrence up with Christian Bale and Amy Adams, well you might just have a masterpiece.This movies not quite a masterpiece but its close. A fantastic tale shot in a fantastic way with fantastic actors, there is not too much to say bad about this movie except maybe its a tiny bit too long. You can loose interest for a moment at times but then your brought straight back into it. Lawrence continues her flourishing career with a scene stealing performance, you live the cinema remembering her part more then any of the others. Not to say the others are not great because they are. OH and look out for a little cameo role from a familiar face.",8,3,7,17 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," McConaughy gives the performance of his career
","Film Review- The Dallas Buyers Club (2013) by raroeMatthew McConaughey for a long time as been one of my favourite actors, anything he is in I tend to enjoy (except for the numerous rubbish rom- coms but hey every ones got to pay the bills) this was no different.The story of Ron Woodroof who is diagnosed as HIV positive in the 1980s, The film explores Ron's attempts to not only survive his situation but make a lot of money from it buy selling unapproved medicine. Over the years there as been some great transformations from actors becoming a character but I do not know any iv seen that is better then McConaugheys, both physical and mental transformation is explosive on the screen. Acting at its best.I have not even mentioned the supporting performance by Jared Leto, who also plays a man suffering with HIV. who also physically transformed into his character who happens to be a transsexual. Leto is believable and brilliant.My favourite film this year. Also my nod for the Oscar for best picture.http://raroe.wordpress.com/",10,3,5,16 February 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Vast improvement on the first Hobbit movie
","Now I am sat in quite a bias position here, as ever since I was in my early teens I would be first in line at the ticket office for any of the Lord Of The Rings movie's. Now I am in my twenties its been the same with the first Hobbit movie and now this one. I am what you would call a big fan of the Tolkien book's movie franchise's. Im just a sucker for an elf to be honest.I think this movie is a little more grown up then the first Hobbit movie. The first was a little slow getting into the movie but this one throws you straight into the action. Its a big imrovement on the first movie. Better characters are introduced as the first movie's characters lacked depth this one makes up for it. Overall its still dragged out to long and you still come away with the feeling that they should of cut the trilogy down to just the one movie. Legolas is back, looking much more sinister then I remember him being in the Lord of the rings movies, Gimli is even mentioned. But what disappointed me most was no gollum. Benedict Cumberbatch voices Smaug the dragon and thats probably the highlight of the movie. As a piece of cinema its not the best, no where near the heights of The Lord Of The Rings but much better then the first Hobbit movie.Martin Freeman puts in a comfortable performance.http://raroe.wordpress.com/",5,2,4,16 February 2014
12 Years a Slave," Simply Brilliant
","Now this films receiving a lot of hype and credit. do not get me wrong it deserves it. Is it the best film of all time?, like some critics are claiming it to be, in my opinion no. It is what you would expect from a Steve McQueen film, who I believe is the best director to come out of the UK in recent years, its powerful and gritty and hard to watch and of course Michael Fassbender stars in it. At one point my girlfriend asked me to it off, I refused.12 years a slave tells the story of Solomon Northup a free black man living in the north of America who gets kidnapped and forced into slavery in the south for as you can guess 12 years. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays the lead character Solomon his performance could not of been bettered in anyway. when he says one thing on screen you know he is saying something else just by his eyes. very much a multi layered performance.I must also mention two other performances, Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o is breathtaking she deserves every award she receives and I this is just the start of a long career. It wont be the last time you see Nyong'o nominated for an Academy Award.Michael Fassbender. wherever a Steve McQueen masterpiece is found Fassbenders not far behind. The director/actor partnership combines yet again. Fassbenders horribly brilliant. He plays a vile slave owner but he plays it great.Although I think this film is good, its very good. Three fantastic performances by a fantastic director producing a very good movie. is it better then Dallas Buyers club for the Oscar in my view no, will it win it? Probablyhttp://raroe.wordpress.com/",9,0,2,16 February 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Scorsese's best in 15 years
",I went into this movie expecting a Scorsese a dramatic film about crime and corruption. At times that is exactly what you get when watching this movie and for the rest of the time its just plain hilarious. The story follows Jordan Belfort's rise to riches through corruption of the stock market its a very funny roller coaster ride. DiCaprio is on fire in this movie as he always is when teamed up with Scorsese. For such a long film your never not gripped. Jonah Hill is equally great as Belforts side man Donnie Azoff. You actually wont believe some of the things these guys get up too and the fact its based on a true story makes it even funnier.5 stars ***** The accidental comedy of the year.The only thing wrong with this film is Matthew McConaughey is not in it long enough but for the time he is in it he is chest beating great. http://raroe.wordpress.com/,8,0,3,16 February 2014
