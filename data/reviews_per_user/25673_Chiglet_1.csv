Howl's Moving Castle," An animated feature about a young girl, curses, and finding one's dreams
","Hayao Miyazaki's 'Howl's Moving Castle' is one of the best motion pictures I have seen in 2005. Even better than his last movie, 'Spirited Away', 'Howl's Moving Castle' draws the viewer into a world where magic and technology have developed along side each other. While appealing to audiences of all ages, This film is reminiscent the heart and spirit of the early Disney films. I normally see a movie only once in the theatres, and even fewer do I consider/plan to purchase. I definitely plan on seeing it (again) in the theatre at least one more time, and will be one of the first in line when the DVD is released for sale.",10,7,10,3 July 2005
