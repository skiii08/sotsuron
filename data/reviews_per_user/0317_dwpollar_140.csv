The Blair Witch Project," Amazing find of documentary...
","1st watched 10/19/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez): Amazing find of documentary put together by three film students in search of the `Blair Witch'(A local legend near Burkettsville, MD).  This movie is itself a documentary and that's what makes it `so' scary.  What starts as a search for this elusive witch becomes a fight for survival for the threesome amongst  weird occurrences and finds that give you the feeling that some satanic cult is in hiding causing havoc.   I know one thing, after watching this movie, you'll never see me venture into any woods alone for any reason(especially around Burkettsville).  Is there a Blair Witch?  Who knows and who cares.  One thing's for sure is that this group was hunted by someone or something and that leaves you with a very eerie feeling after the movie's over.",8,0,1,19 October 2003
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Despite lunacy of plot, entertaining movie...
","1st watched 1/20/2008 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Jon Turtletaub): Despite lunacy of plot, entertaining movie. In the follow-up to the 1st 'National Treasure' where Nicholas Cage and the gang try to uncover hidden secrets in U.S. landmarks looking for a treasure hidden from the British soldiers during the civil war --- a twist is thrown in right from the beginning where the Gates family of treasure-hunters names could be darkened forever by a rumor that an ancestor was part in the assassination of Lincoln. This put Cage and company back on the trail of the treasure to prove that it's real and there is no truth to the rumor. Of course, there is an antagonist other treasure hunter, played by Ed Harris, portraying an ancestor of John Wilkes Boothe who wants his rumor kept in place to free up his family's evil past. This begins the ever increasingly complicated series of clues leading eventually to a literal goldmine(hint, hint). Of course, Mr. Gates has the same companions as the first movie with added ones, like his Mom, played by the Queen portrayer, Helen Mirren, who can read ancient lost Indian symbols and is sought after once an artifact is found leading to more answers. The bottom line is this movie is overblown, idiotic, non-sensical Hollywood-fare but has a sense of humor and a pace that gets increasingly harder to turn from and makes it a watchable and entertaining movie. One of the highest forms of escapist entertainment because of it's absurdity but if that's what you're looking for it's perfect. There are also some wonderful sets and puzzles that have to be solved as the movie goes on that reveals a very well-thought out and executed thriller to enchant and entertain the masses. Which this definitely does despite it's silliness.",7,0,4,4 February 2008
Angels & Demons," Good puzzle-solving mystery type movie...
","1st watched 11/23/2010 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Ron Howard) Good puzzle-solving mystery type movie for about ¾ of the film with a confusing ending. The ending was convoluted but the rest of the movie and the search was good enough to make up for this flaw. This movie is a sequel to the Ron Howard/Tom Hanks original Catholicism thriller called 'The Davinci Code' with the same author penning the book, Dan Brown. The movie does a great job with pacing and keeping the viewer interested and that's why I recommend the film. The Hanks' character is slightly more agitated and perturbed than in the original but keeps those feeling at bay long enough to care for people in general and help stop the murders of four potential new pope's. The story starts with the current pope dying and the electee's being kidnapped by an anti-catholic group called the Illuminati. Hanks' character is called in to help the church find them and stop their extermination. A side character is an anti-matter expert and helps find a bomb in the Vatican that could potentially blow up the region. Another side character, played by Ewan McGregor was the pope's assistant and the filmmakers play a juggling act with him, as far as how the viewer's perceive him. Other than this, no side stories are introduced and the pacing is quick which helps the movie. Overall, this was a good sequel(in the vein of the National Treasure movies) that was better than the original – in my opinion.",6,0,0,26 November 2010
Vertigo," Classic Hitchcock thriller with excellent performances...
","1st watched 10/28/2001 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): *Spoilers*Classic Hitchcock thriller with excellent performances by Jimmie Stewart and Kim Novak.  This movie is a unique experience to watch because as a viewer you are in Stewart's shoes until the reality of the situation is revealed to you by Hitchcock and of course Stewart is the kind of star that we're always routing for(so we're hoping for the best till the very end).  Guess what? We don't exactly get what we're hoping for, and that's what makes this is a special film in my eyes.  It goes against the grain by putting likeable characters who actually don't come out on the good side.  This makes for a horrible viewing experience in some people's eyes, but to me it throws a twist into what should be expected from these viewing experiences(Now when I see Jimmie Stewart, I don't always expect him to get the girl -- in a way). The movie is technically well done as well with even some animation thrown in for a dream sequence.  All in all I believe this is one of the (if not the best) Hitchcock movie which has influenced many future movies by other directors and will probably continue to influence more.  Bravo!!",9,4,5,28 October 2001
Howl's Moving Castle," Complicated and inventive fantasy...
","1st watched 7/26/2009 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-Hayao Miyazaki): Complicated and inventive fantasy from legendary Japanese animation director Miyazaki entertains the senses and the mind as well as the heart with this one. The story is about a moving castle lived in by a wizard called Howl as kind of a way of escaping from the responsibility of serving in a war he doesn't believe in. A young girl becomes attached to the character after a spell from a witch makes her old and she goes into the castle. These and other characters are very likable and include a mute scarecrow, a talking fire that moves the castle and more. The animation is wonderful even though sometimes the story is hard to follow. It's also a romantic movie about the young character and Howl, although this doesn't really kick in til' near the end. The female character teaches Howl eventually about not avoiding responsibilities and he learns to deeply care for her. All in all, a very complex story that really is fun also. A winner from this heralded Japanese director.",7,1,2,23 August 2009
Alien 3," overall just not as good as the first two
","1st watched 10/20/2000 - 5 out of 10 (Dir-David Fincher): Not as suspensful as the 1st, not  as action-filled as the 2nd, and overall just not as good as the first two although the ending is full of action, but there is an awful slow lead up to the last 1/2 hour.",5,10,16,25 March 2001
Antz," Very good story and unique computer animation ...
","1st watched 5/1/1999 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Eric Darnell & Tim Johnson): Very good story and unique computer animation are only part of what makes this an excellent movie.  Not really for kids with it's deep story, and some adult language and humor, but very well done despite.",8,0,0,21 March 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Capable, much-awaited prequel to the star wars series...
","1st watched 9/12/2000 - 6 out of 10(Dir-George Lucas): Capable, much-awaited prequel to the star wars series delivers in the same type of way that the original did.Surprising you visually with every scene and delivers with the same good guy fighting the bad guys cowboys in space theme. Bring it on Episode 2 !!",6,1,4,23 March 2001
The Sound of Music," Excellent uplifting musical...
","1st watched 9/21/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Robert Wise): Excellent uplifting musical with good realistic storyline based on an actual troup of family singers who escaped Nazi reign in Austria just prior to World War I.  There are many singable and recognizable songs in this movie, but there also are well-done characters brought to light by Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer.  Sometimes the story gets faded by melo-dramatic romantic moments, but what the heck(it is a musical, you know). Cinematically beautifully captured mountains and Austrian landscape also lend to the appreciation of this play brought to film.  There definetly are not many movies like this that bring together drama and music so well.  I guess this and many other reasons are why this movie will be loved for a long time.",8,2,9,21 September 2002
Spartacus," Sprawling inconsistent epic movie...
","1st watched 12/6/2014 -- 5 out of 10(Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Sprawling inconsistent epic movie directed by Stanley Kubrick with a very good performance by executive producer Kirk Douglas as Spartacus and good cinematography, but a story that has it's good parts and bad parts but not enough of the good to carry it over the top. The story is about a slave in Italy who starts an uprising that eventually rises up to fight against Rome itself. Douglas portrays the main character with passion and a performance where the camera just placed on his face tells his character's story. Jean Simmons portrays another slave that tweaks his romantic interests at a gladiator training facility, which he is transferred to after being bought by Peter Ustinov's character, that trains slaves and treats them like Gods until they are transferred to another facility where they have to fight to their death's for entertainment purposes for Roman citizens. Laurence Olivier's character, who is a wealthy influential person, visits the facility and forces the caretaker to prematurely do a couple of fights to the death including Spartacus. He survives, of course, but then starts the uprising upon hearing that Simmon's character is being sent to another location. This is where the film doesn't do a good job, in my opinion, because it makes it look like it all started over a lover's spat when obviously Spartacus had a bigger idea in mind. Douglas and Simmons carry on a very powerful screen romance but this overpowers the bigger story. He then commands the slave army to try and accomplish the task of freeing all the slaves in the whole of Italy. The political complexities in Rome and the conflict between the Roman characters actually slows down the movie. Olivier's character's motivations are never explored so the conflict between him and Spartacus is not a watchable piece of entertainment. There are some wonderful moments of cinematography especially the initial fight between the Romans and the slaves but these small moments don't sustain a full 3 hours plus. Not a worthless piece of entertainment, but not good enough to keep your full interest throughout the whole length of this long epic.",5,2,5,20 December 2014
Deepwater Horizon," Well done recreation of the BP oil rig that blew up in 2010...
","1st watched 10/15/2016 :
Well done recreation of the BP oil rig that blew up in 2010 and started a major investigation. The movie is 'not' about the investigation, but about the oil rig(called 'Deepwater Horizon'), and the people who worked on it and were a part of the disaster. This movie shines because it focuses on this aspect of the incident(the disaster itself). It stars a bunch of capable actors including Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, John Malkovich, and Kate Hudson - who encompass a story, I believe, that people want to hear. The workers knew they weren't in for a cakewalk when they boarded the hovering ship. Right away - the 2 big dogs(Russell & Wahlberg) question the lack of a concrete stress test. The bigwigs are interested in getting the drilling done as quickly as possible, but the ones that know what they are doing won't easily falter. Eventually - after a few stress tests - they allow the drilling to happen, but things soon fall apart. The rest of the movie is the action of the disaster - unknown by most folks, without seeing this movie. This is why the movie is so interesting and effective. Not to be missed.",8,0,0,10 May 2020
Deja Vu," Good start but non-sensical...
","1st watched 5/28/2009 – 5 out of 10 (Dir- Tony Scott): Good start but non-sensical ending destroys what could have been a good detective story. The movie is basically about a terrorist setting off a bomb on a New Orleans ferry and a detective from the ATF, played by Denzel Washington, trying to figure out who did it and why. Once he's added to a secret team to work on the issue, he's introduced to a machine that looks back four days in time and is able to do surveillance, somehow. But we find out later that the machine isn't just capable of surveillance but is also a time machine. It's not been used much for real interacting with the past(they've only sent small object back) but they try it with a piece of paper that will hint the past cops as to what's happening – it doesn't quite work but gives Denzel's character the idea to try more. He gets attracted to a victim and after the case is solved he decides he wants to send himself back to save her and possibly stop the event from ever occurring. This is where the story gets goofy as the machine has never been tested with humans and it makes no sense that they would allow him to do this. The rest of the movie is ridiculous as most movies that explore time travel are and destroyed what could have been a good movie. Of course, the gimmick had to be used for this purpose to appease our action-oriented, gimmick-driven, good guy gets the girl American movie audience but this is what makes it fall apart. Too bad because it definitely was compelling in the first half.",5,2,4,8 June 2009
It," Excellent scary story about a small town haunted by disappearances...
","1st watched 7/14/2018 :
Excellent scary story about a small town haunted by disappearances. The story begins with the disappearance of the young brother, Georgie, of the main character - Billy. Than, 1 by 1, we are introduced to the cast of outcast kids and their real-life fears. A scary clown, named Pennywise - is the reason for all the disappearances every 27 years, but - of course - only the group of outcast kids are revealed this - while the rest of the town ignore the issue. This movie works in a lot of ways - 1) As a scary movie, 2) As a story about facing your fears, and 3) a coming of age tale. There is no major stars in the film, but it is played out and directed almost flawlessly. It is all portrayed from the perspective of the kids - as the adults in the movie are mere window-dressing. Every child in the group that determines to confront the evil character has a backstory, and a reason for their fears except one who just fears clowns and we don't know why. As the kids each have strange visions they begin to come together sharing these stories. They determine the epicenter of the issue being a well, in town, which is now located in an old deserted house, and they visit it together to confront Pennywise. The ideas of togetherness and facing your fears is evident in the story, and these things become important to the conclusion of the movie. A must see horror/drama - being one of the better Stephen King interpretations brought to the screen.",8,2,3,13 June 2020
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Mostly unfunny movie...
","1st watched 6/4/2001 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Terry Jones): Mostly unfunny movie based on a child born in a manger next to Jesus called Brian.  Some of Monty Python's humor comes through, but it doesn't seem to work too well in this setting.  I think that if it wasn't in reference to Jesus Christ they could have made this movie funny.  The movie itself does not make fun of christians or Jesus but rather things in the time like stonings, lepers, and the Romans.  The funniest scene in my opinion just happens to be the last of the movie where one of the crucified breaks out into song about looking at the bright side of life.  There were not enough funny scenes to recommend this movie.  Their best in my opinion is still their earliest 'The Holy Grail.'",3,15,96,3 June 2001
Erin Brockovich," Feel good story with good performances...
","1st watched 6/6/2001 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Steven Soderburgh): Feel good story with good performances from Julie Roberts & Albert Finney make this tug-at-the-heart film work.  We know from the beginning that there will be a happy ending which lessons the realistic quality that it could have had.  This is definetly a Hollywood picture and good causes are usually received well these days both by the public and the Oscars.  I recommend this as a good Hollywood movie, and Roberts does a good job with what she has but I've seen her better. She probably won the Oscar for her career, but oh well why not.  Back to the film--- a well-made cleanly drawn picture of a real person who probably was not quite as impressive in real life as the character was, but that's the way this type of movie is usually made otherwise we wouldn't want to watch it would we, but this one we do.",7,1,2,10 June 2001
Fight Club," Off-the-wall strange production...
","1st watched 2/16/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-David Fincher): Off-the-wall strange production that is basically about a middle-of-the-road man trying to change things in his life and the world around him by becoming his ultra-ego.  Yes, it is about a fight club and it does have Brad Pitt in it and this is basically all we're told about this movie by the sales people.  This movie is so much more than that!  It is definetly one that needs to be seen again to get a full understanding of what's going on. It seems simple enough in the beginning, kind of.  The middle-of-the-road guy meets an off-the-wall free spirit in Brad Pitt and then becomes further and further involved in his life.  They start a club together to basically get out our frustrations from daily life by pummeling our fellow man and then living to go another round.  The association becomes more and more complex and increasingly more specifically focused on corporate america until a wild finale with the two men, who are really one man, duking it out on each other to the very end until one side wins over the other.  The romantic interest, played by Helena Bonham Carter is kind of just thrown into the middle of this whole mess but sticks with the one man until the very end.  If I've confused you, I'm sorry.  See the movie and you'll know why I'm confused!! But it's a good kind of confusion that I like to see in films of unique quality like this one and the more publicized Memento.  It's amazing that this was distributed by one of the big boys(20th Century Fox) despite it's uniqueness.  I guess, Brad P. threw some of his money in on this one.",8,1,3,16 February 2003
Memento," A one of a kind event...
","1st watched 1/26/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Christopher Nolan): A one of a kind event is what this complex drama/thriller is.  It's basically about a man who lost his short-term memory after his wife's death and then gets used by people under the disguise of him killing his wife's murderer.  The unique filming from present to past with shots almost like the main character views them confuses the audience but at the same time keeps you watching.  Watching this movie is almost like solving a complex puzzle where you know there's a solution and you have to keep trying to find it.  The problem is you have to think through everything you saw to even figure out the puzzle once the movie is over.  The performances are wonderful from top to bottom even though I don't even remember the names of the stars(uh, oh - maybe I got it now.).  But seriously, the filmmaking and the performances make this a must see at least for a couple of viewings and then some good discussion afterwards as well.",8,0,2,26 January 2003
Underworld," Action-packed battle...
","1st watched 2/5/2006, 6 out of 10(Dir-Len Wiseman): Action-packed battle from beginning to end in this initial showing of the feud between vampires & lycans(the werewolfs). Not as good as the following, but plenty to keep your interest. Despite the comic book fantasy storyline and loads of action, the director(Len Wiseman) does a good job of pulling you in by keeping your interest in the characters involved. Beckinsale & Speedman are very believable in their portrayals of the death-dealer Vampiress and the confused human in the middle of this battle. Another thing I liked about this movie is that by the end, you're not sure who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, although at the beginning the Lycans appear to be the bad folk. All in all, this is a unique twist on the horror/action genre that is well done technically and flows well with maybe a little too much gun fighting when you figure that these creatures should have more to battle with because of what they are. But definitely a tad better than the normal action movie and a nice idea that should be able to be built on in later movies, TV shows etc..",6,0,0,5 February 2006
Coraline," Disturbing & creepy animated feature...
","1st watched 10/18/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir- Henry Selick): Disturbing & creepy animated feature from the Director who brought us 'The Nightmare B4 Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach.' This story is about a young girl who is not happy with her current life and the lack of attention she gets. She is given a doll that looks suspiciously like her by a neighbor's grandmother and then while asleep is introduced to another world thru a hole-in-the-wall where everything is the way she'd like it to be(except everyone has buttons for eyes). She likes this other world until she's told they have to give her buttons for eyes as well, and she would prefer this not to be done to her. At this point in the story, this alternate world becomes very evil and the other world's mother is revealed to just want to possess her(which she's apparently done to many other children). This is where the story becomes out of whack and never really recovers. I think the other problem with this movie is the lack of humor. There aren't any characters that provide this, so you're treated with this crazy girl's mixed-up reality that goes haywire but nothing brings you out of it. The animation is really well done and very unique at times but the story doesn't have much of a heart. What's lost is the 'why' behind everything. The girl really doesn't learn any real lessons and no characters are very interesting except maybe the cat that talks in the alternate world. So basically, this movie is technically well made, but not a good movie.",4,3,9,14 November 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Good love story in this highly awarded film...

12 Monkeys," Weird and hard movie to follow about the future...
",1st watched 9/10/1996 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Terry Gilliam): Weird and hard movie to follow about the future.  Similar in this sense as an earlier film by him called 'Brazil.'  I personally couldn't figure out the purpose behind all of the madness happening on the screen.,4,3,17,26 March 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Action-packed sequel to the Disney-ride original...
","1st watched 11/26/2006 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Gore Verbinski): Action-packed sequel to the Disney-ride original in an obvious 2nd out of 3 movies in this series. We follow our favorite anti-hero Pirate, Jack Sparrow thru his goofy exploits on the sea as he tries to recover a key to open the chest that houses the actual beating heart of the un-dead computer-animated octopus-faced 'Davy Jones'. His reason for recovering it is to pay him back on what he owes him. Jones is the leader of a ghostly gang aboard the floating Dutchmen that terrorizes the ocean seeking souls to join his undead crew. There are, I think, another 3 or 4 people looking for the same object for different reasons(all for their own safety I must say). The action is definitely almost non-stop with a couple of humorous sets and a couple of good lines from the Rolling stones impersonating Pirate, played by Johnny Depp. The problem with this movie is that we know who's going to make it out of every hair-raising situation so there's no suspense. And as far as drama, forget about itinstead we have a few people searching for an elusive trinket to help them out of their own particular predicament and people getting into situations way over their heads for the sake of their own interests. But of course, everything will work out for all of our most popular swashbuckling characters, as long as you keep watching even through the 3rd movie of course. There was definitely a lot of money put into the computer-animated special effects and the choreography of the fight sequences had to take some work, but who really cares?? In my opinion, this is just another Hollywood money-making machine so let's all join the cause and wait until the 3rd one is available for free somewhere before we watch it Who's with me??",4,1,2,26 November 2006
12 Angry Men," Excellent story and acting ...
",1st watched 9/26/1998 - (Dir-Sidney Lumet) Excellent story and acting in this jury room drama almost entirely based in this locale.  Definitely you become more interested in watching the process rather than caring about the outcome in this textbook example of how a jury must go about deciding on a case.,8,0,1,10 March 2001
The English Patient," Well-written and played out story ...
",1st watched 9/2/2000 - (Dir-Anthony Minghella): Well-written and played out story that starts out involving a badly burned pilot and his care mostly given by Binoche.  Everything really revolves around the Binoche character although there are plenty of mini-stories built into the movie and all of them are interesting. Very much like a modern Doctor Zhivago.,10,1,3,15 March 2001
Balls of Fury," Funny, inventive comedy...
","1st watched 1/29/2008 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Robert Ben Garant): Funny, inventive comedy without the benefit of big name comedians. This movie did very well from beginning to end of moving the story along and providing funny and captivating characters every step of the way. Usually a gimmick-type movie stalls about ½ the way thru, but this one does not let up and is not happy with just a few jokes repeated over and over again. The story revolves around an Olympic table tennis player who lost a big game and has been in exile since that loss. An FBI agent, played by comedian George Lopez, seeks the ping-pong player out to compete again so that he can get to a wanted mean guy by being invited to his tournament after all his wins. It doesn't start out very well as he loses his first tournament but in typical 'rocky-style' he gets focused with the help of a trainer and picks up the pace. This happens fairly quickly, which is the only down part of the movie in my opinion. A blind, karate-kid style mentor helps him believe in himself(believe it or not). Next steps in the evil and feminine tournament organizer, played by Christopher Walken, as the long big name in the movie. He is hilarious in this role and helps the last half of the movie continue in it's fun onslaught. Yes, I am a fan of table tennis(aka. Ping-pong) and I was looking forward to this movie because of this, but it exceeded my expectations as a funny movie from beginning to end. Don't miss it.",7,0,0,8 February 2008
Hot Fuzz," Funny tongue-in-cheek spoof of American action movies...
","1st watched 10/30/2011 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Edgar Wright): Funny tongue-in-cheek spoof of American action movies with Simon Pegg playing a cop that's too good for the big city of London – so he's promoted(aka. Demoted) to be a sheriff of a small village because he's making everyone look bad. The same team that made 'Shaun of the Dead' was involved in this British farce that sometimes goes a little overboard late in the movie, but for the most part is laugh-out-loud funny. They kind of do an-overdone last half hour action scene but add gags in the middle of everything to help you realize that even the drawn-out action is part of the farce. The perfect police officer finds people to arrest in the new village the night of his arrival, even before he's officially on the job. A few deaths then start to occur and he starts suspecting something fishy is going on. Of course, the locals, say the deaths are just accidents because the village is going for 'village of the year' and couldn't have the 'm' word(murder) happen in their little bungalow. His partner, played by Nick Frost, is about the only one who believes him and plays a great sidekick to the straight-laced Pegg. The rest of the cast does their part, but the writing and Pegg's straight-lace portrayal is what makes the movie work. The movie really isn't about one-liners but instead just the idea that the ones making the movie are laughing in their heads and keep straight faces so we can do the laughing. This is definitely not a perfect movie but as a comedy it is one of the better ones I've seen lately.",7,0,1,1 November 2011
The Mummy," Good fun throughout
",1st watched 12/31/1999 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Stephen Sommers): Excellent action film made similar to the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' type of films in it's style.The goriness that it has is mixed with humor with a perfectly matched couple in Fraser & Weisz who don't know what their doing but seem to do it very well in hunting for the mummy. Good fun throughout.,7,0,0,23 March 2001
Dead Poets Society," Excellent story and superb direction...
","1st watched 4/7/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Peter Weir): Excellent story and superb direction by Weir make this drama work.  There have been many movies about teacher's who relate to their students in greater ways than what normally is expected but this one is more about the students than the teacher.  Robin Williams plays a new English teacher for a very high-brow preparatory school and doesn't follow the book to teach his kids.  He emphasizes that they 'Sieze' every day because it may be their last and teaches them how poetry is about passion of life rather than just a subject in school.  Some of the students grab a-hold of his teaching and form a secret soceity that reads poetry in a scary cave near the school. The philosophy bleeds into their lives and starts to reek havic on their normal everyday lives but they for once are truly learning about themselves and learning from their life experiences. A tragedy occurs with one of the students and this is where the story takes a turn and life starts to be the judge as to whether the students really believe what they think they do. Excellent performances and a compelling story keep you involved with the characters till the end.  In my opinion, the ending left a lot to be desired but the rest of the movie was a typical well-done Peter Weir directed story.",7,0,1,7 April 2002

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Plenty of action, comedy, and romance but overall a pointless movie...
","1st watched 9/2/2007, 4 out of 10(Dir-Gore Verbinski): Plenty of action, comedy, and romance but overall a pointless movie-going experience once again from Gore Verbinski and the gang trying to turn a Walt Disney amusement park ride into a third movie for all the kiddies and adults to dish out their money on. There is a little more of the comedy aspect in this one than in the second turning the Johnny Depp character, Jack sparrow, almost into a silent comedian-type with all the shtick that he goes thru. The movie makers teased us with the upcoming Keith Richards cameo as Sparrow's father and the romance of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters blossoming into a marriage but these were very minor parts of the overblown and overlong 3 hour + movie that this one turned out to be. This adventure started in Singapore as pirates around the world(representing free men) are trying to unite against the evil British-like empire(representing the oppressive slave-based upperclass). Jack Sparrow is in Davy Jones's Locker going mad as he commands a crew of his own look-a-like's which leads to some funny scenes. Bloom & Knightley and others are trying to find him and free him from this other-worldly grave for one reason or another. They are successful, of course, and the battle begins. kind of. There are so many other elements to this movie too numerous to mention that just confuse the heck out of the thing to the point where you realize that all the dialogue is just going to lead into an action-filled climax, so as the viewer you kind of give up on the particulars and wait for this. This, in my opinion, is the fault of the director(if he can't make us understand the plot why include it at all??). Pieces of these specifics include a witch turning into A giant force of nature, the return of the Davy Jones ship and it's crew siding with the Brits, and a guy-girl romance with the hint of jealousy over Jack Sparrow, of course. All of this is thrown together into a money-wasting overblown swashbuckling adventure leaving the viewer looking at this watch wondering when it's all going to end. Oh Hollywood, when are you going to believe that the American audience is smart and has a heart instead of peddling us this junk as entertainment?? -- I guess never because we keep shelling out the dough so that another one can come out with the same senseless stuff as the one before(don't be surprised if there is a number four in this series and more...).",4,0,1,3 September 2007
The Prestige," Amazing, complex story of trickery and deception...
","1st watched 1/1/2007 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Christopher Nolan): Amazing, complex story of trickery and deception put together by a Director who appears to be becoming a master in this field, which he started in his first movie, Memento. Christopher Nolan starts off with a simple story of a man accused of the murder of another man. They both happen to be in the same field of magic and we're major competitors in this arena. We then are taken backwards to the events that led up to this supposed murder. This is where the movie becomes extremely complex and is driven by the wonderful subtle performances of everyone involved. This is one of those movies where you don't want to miss any points of dialogue because you're afraid you'll miss out on something important, and with Nolan, you will be. He is able to sustain a mostly dialogue-driven movie for over two hours and your mind is still racing as the final credits roll. The magicians', played by Hugh Jackman & Christian Bale, personal battles are the major focus which started when Jackman's character's wife is killed during a failed magic trick where he blames Bale's character. But also entering unto the scene is the idea of performing the ultimate illusion by possible using 'real magic', which in this case is electricity re-directed to transpose a person from one place to another. This is being tested by a man named Tesla, played wonderfully by the rock star/actor David Bowie, as the government & Thomas Edison vehemently tries to pull the plug & funding to shutdown the experiments. This subplot was a personal revelation to me because of a song by a group coincidentally called Tesla, called 'Edison's medicine', which suggests trickery & under-handed things being done so he could gain the rights to electricity. Anyway, back to the movie--- All of these elements are blended together so well that the only reason I didn't give the movie a 10 is because of the confusion at the end(wish was actually part of the fun of the movie, but could be distracting to some). It would amaze me if a better movie was made in 2006, but it probably won't win the Oscar because it's too thought-provoking, which is too bad. I will be anxiously awaiting another Christopher Nolan movie though, as I'm sure many other people are as well.",9,2,4,1 January 2007
The Terminator," Non-stop action thriller...
",1st watched 5/12/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-James Cameron): Non-stop action thriller not unlike Alien except 'Arnold Swarzenegger' is the unstoppable alien(this time it's a Cyborg from the future).  Arnold is perfect for this role and Biehn is also good as Sarah Conner's(Linda Hamilton) protector.   Keeps you interested from beginning to end which to me is a good indication of a good action/thriller.  It does what it's supposed to do and Cameron does a good job of keeping the pace up.,7,1,3,12 May 2002
Cloverfield," Scary and uniquely filmed story...
","1st watched 7/18/2009 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-Matt Reeves): Scary and uniquely filmed story about a group of friends and their perspective of an attack on New York City from what appears to be an alien. The movie is shown from the perspective of a hand-held camera owned by the main character in the story and guided most of the time by his friend(who he gave the job to at his going away party). The story is really about a group of friends and what they go through to stay alive and together thru this attack. The whole movie is a government-supported film that was found in the aftermath of the incident and starts with a couple enjoying their day then we're sent to the going away party and the calamity starts. We never really see what the creature attacking the city looks like til halfway thru the movie and not close-up til the very end. What we see instead is the destruction that's caused which makes for a very different movie of this type and adds to the interest. The ending is also very unique in that we don't really know what happens to the main characters or the creature. Although this isn't popular film-making it adds to the intrigue. If you like 'Blair Witch Project', you'll like this one – it's really kind of a monster movie version of that one-of-a-kind film. But again, it's not for all tastes similar to the previously mentioned movie.",7,0,2,9 August 2009
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Well-done 3rd entry in the Star Wars series...
","1st watched 4/4/2001 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Richard Marquand): Well-done 3rd entry in the Star Wars series(Episode VI in the script), despite disgusting scenes at the beginning involving Jaba the Hutt.  Once the action moves away from him is when the movie picks up speed and starts to look and feel like the other Star Wars entries.  Before the movie's over you feel like you never want it to end, and that's the way these films capture you.  Because they are so well done in sound, visuals, and the building of the characters it feels great to be a part of this experience. The simple story seems to take a side-track to the technical expertise which gives you the warm and fuzzies. How sweet it is !!",7,0,1,5 May 2001
MASH," Quirky, sometimes hilarious spoof of war...
","1st watched 8/4/2001 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Altman): Quirky, sometimes hilarious spoof of war, life, and death.  The movie takes serious subjects and laughs in the face at them and we laugh as well. Altman picks at religion, women's lib, suicide, homosexuality, marraige, death, and the war in general.  Gould and Sutherland have a tremendous repertoire for humor with every other character having his or her own quirkiness that gets exploited before the end of the movie.  Strange abrupt ending almost seems to beg for what comes next - A TV series!!",7,0,2,4 August 2001
Pan's Labyrinth," Excellent dark storytelling...
","1st watched 6/3/2007 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Guillermo del Toro): Excellent dark storytelling from Director Guillermo del Toro in this much heralded fantasy film from Mexico. There are really two stories in this film. The first concerns fighting in the Spanish civil war between the established government and rebels. The second involves a little girl and her mother who's expecting and arriving to live with their new father and husband. He happens to be a ruthless & prideful General for the government who will do anything to stop the uprising of the rebels and to have a son and heir to his throne, apparently. The girl finds a labyrinth on the grounds and starts encountering different fantasy characters as she explores it. The movie is a combination of the harsh reality of the situation and the endearing fantasies of a little girl who's trapped in a reality that's almost too hard to bear. This is definitely not a children's movie because of the intense emotions depicted and the things that happen to the character's throughout. This is a very hard movie to get through but it is a great bit of storytelling and worth it to work thru it if you can.",8,1,3,5 June 2007
Alien," Well-constructed scary movie...
","1st watched 6/2/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Ridley Scott): Well-constructed scary movie where the murderer just happens to be an alien. Tremendously paced & photographed by director Ridley Scott, keeping you on the edge of the seat till the very end.  Sigourney Weaver is not necessarily the star in this movie, she just happens to be the only survivor, and then goes on to be the star in the many sequels that follow. There are many well done things in this movie including the transition of the alien itself from the attached lifeform on John Hurt's character's face to the almost human-like appearance that it has near the end.   The story itself is simple but the characters are very down to earth and believable enough that you do care for them unlike some cheap horror movies where the characters are so stupid that you want them to die.  It is no doubt why the movie started a trend of these type of pictures because of it's obvious box-office appeal and the quality that was put into it.  It's successors of course do not come close to the type of all-around quality that is displayed in this picture.",8,0,1,2 June 2001
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Twisted and morbid dark-comedy musical...
","1st watched 3/26/2009  4 out of 10(Dir-Tim Burton): Twisted and morbid dark-comedy musical about a barber, played by Johnny Depp, who's taken away from his family by an un-just judge. He changes his name and decides to have vengeance against this judge, somehow  someway! His vengeful ways get twisted about half-way thru in the movie after he opens a shop above a meat-pie baker, played by Helena Bonham Carter, and he starts taking out anyone that comes to his shop, The baker then starts profiting from his extra meat, if you know what I mean. This movie was a valiant effort by Tim Burton to try and bring to the screen this sad and demented musical. Depp is good as usual but he can't redeem the story and the character that he had to play. At first, he appears justified in his actions, but he kind of goes off the deep end. This is where the movie lost it's appeal, in my opinion. Burton probably didn't want to stray from the story but something should have been done to make us care a little more for the character. There is a side story about Todd's daughter, who is held prisoner by her step-father, played by Alan Rickman, and is adored by Todd's friend to the point of wanting to rescue her. As you can tell the real story here though is Todd's attempt to reconcile with his family but it's not really pursued very well and instead it's about him slicing as many necks as possible to benefit the baker below. Too much gruesomeness and not enough soul-searching. The songs are fine and the film looks good but again the story can't redeem the overall movie experience.",4,1,3,30 March 2009
Taxi Driver," Disturbing and well-crafted docudrama...
",1st watched 7/6/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Martin Scorsese): Disturbing and well-crafted docudrama about a taxi driver who feels compelled to take matters into his own hands and clean-up the 'filth' surrounding him.  Deniro is excellent as the disturbed Travis Bickle and carries the picture.  Scorsese's direction is unusual but effective and although at times we don't feel like the story is going anywhere we don't care because this film is more about the life of a disturbed man rather than a 'movie' about the life of a disturbed man(if you know what I mean).  A very realistic depiction of a man acting out what his feeling's are without holding back anything.  On this level the film works because it's not preaching at us but letting us observe and come to our own conclusions.,7,0,2,6 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Strong entry in the popular sci-fi saga...
","1st watched 1/11/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-George Lucas): Strong entry in the popular sci-fi saga with a good mix of action and romance.  Lucas continues to add more variety and uniqueness to landscapes, creatures, and machinery that boggles the imagination and keeps your eyes open on every frame.  The story is somewhat typical good guys/bad guys Star Wars, but there is an added twist of a romance occurring between young Anakin SkyWalker and the newly elected Senator Nabia of the Republic. Something else that actually is better than the original entries is the acting.  The cast does an excellent job and it is obvious that most of their careers will not be trapped in Star Wars(unlike some of the actors in the original).  Again, because of Lucas's uniqueness in this and every  entry in this saga the much awaited grouping of all of them in their original intended order will be a sight to see once their all done.  Keep on Mr. Lucas !!",7,0,1,11 January 2003

"Monsters, Inc."," Funny and well made animated film from the Pixar group...
","1st watched 12/29/2012 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Pete Docter & David Silverman): Funny and well made animated film from the Pixar group with a simple story, but technically well executed. The story is about an alternate world where monsters gain energy for their existence by getting screams from children by scaring them after entering their world from their closet doors. The company, 'Monsters, Inc', captures this energy and Sully, voiced by John Goodman, is the highest energy producer for them. His friend Mike, voiced by Billy Crystal, is his assistant. The evil character is the runner-up color-shifting monster that is behind Sully in energy points, but is found out to be cheating by capturing kids and extracting the screams out of them with a machine. One kid, named Boo by Sully, escapes and Sully and Mike have to figure out how to get her back to her real world and expose the evil monster's doings to the company. They do a lot of retread simple 'TV show'-type of humor around this story which makes the movie not as good as it could have been, but the animation is superb and unique enough to keep you interested until the end. The 3D is good and not over-bearing showing the perspective and size of some of the animated sets where the characters work in. This is not the best of the Disney animated films because of the simplistic story, but there is the usual expert craftsmanship that has definitely gone into this like so many of the others. The computer animation is very good despite it's 2001 release and I have to say that this is a worthwhile effort in the Disney cannon despite it's shortcomings in the story.",7,0,1,1 January 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," OK action & chase movie...
","1st watched 3/27/2009 – 5 out of 10 (Dir-Paul Greengrass): OK action & chase movie where there is basically one storyline. Jason Bourne, played by Matt Damon, is trying to determine his initial identity before working for the C.I.A. The CIA is trying to find him and terminate him before he figures this out. There are some subplots like a secret initiative where the CIA can kill anyone who gets in the way, a possible prior romance with a CIA agent played by Julia Stiles that is barely followed, and that's about it. The reluctant hero this time isn't given very many lines this time he just does a lot of running, jumping, hitting, killing, driving a variety of vehicles and is basically given the line ' we've got to go' too many times. This is OK for an action movie, but this one has very little substance to any of the characters, which doesn't make you care much for them after the movie is over. In the first movie, Damon's character was established and we got to see him try to have a romance with another woman who was kind of on the run also – which made it interesting. In this one, he doesn't have much time for anything else but his ultimate goal – find out who he is!! A little more sympathetic agent, played by Joan Allen, late in the movie tries to help Bourne after finding out the corruption in the CIA which makes things a little more interesting, but by the time she gets involved the movie's about over and it doesn't do much to help it overall. So, if you like action movie's this one's OK , but don't expect much else.",5,0,1,1 April 2009
10 Things I Hate About You," Formulaic older than teen high school movie...
","1st watched 8/14/2004 - 3 out of 10 (Dir- Gil Junger): Formulaic older than teen high school movie that had very little going for it except for the music sounded good on surround sound. The talent was wasted with this piece of TV-like fluff. Julia Stiles & Heath Ledger have a lot of talent but apparently not very good agents to allow them to be in this. This is basically about two sisters who are very different and want to date boys but daddy won't let them unless they both do it together. Soooooo, basically they work it out so that they both live happily ever after by the end in their high school heaven. And the title doesn't work at all for this movie because this isn't about chicks putting down guys, but this was a poem brought up near the very end of the movie that the Stiles character didn't even believe. Nuff said, please avoid this loser.",3,3,6,15 August 2004
Oblivion," Very good story...
","1st watched 5/4/2013 – (Dir-Joseph Kosinski): Very good story about a drone repairman from the future named Jack Harper, played by Tom Cruise, who believes he is protecting the current Earth from a group called the Scavs – whom they won a war against --- and are gathering resources so that the remaining humans can transport to Titan due to the current Earth being destroyed by nukes. His memory has been erased supposedly, I guess, so the horrors of the war and how the Earth used to be won't cause too much depression, but he has dreams that later reveal some in-accuracies in what he believes to be true. The movie is visually very appealing, and has very few flaws that you really have to work to find, but it's definitely not the type of story to get the Academy's attention(except at a technical level). Despite that – this is the best movie I've seen released in 2013. Jack's dreams eventually connect to an incident where a spacecraft crash lands on the devastated Earth and he saves one girl(who just happened to be in his dreams as well). To say much more would reveal spoilers, and I would rather you watch this movie and see the complicated twists that happen to turn Jack upside-down and make his purpose of existence much different than what he originally thought. Do not miss this one – you will not be disappointed in this graphic novel based future fantasy & sci-fi film.",9,1,4,7 May 2013
The Bourne Identity," Excellent action movie...
","1st watched 12/18/2008 (Dir-Doug Liman): Excellent action movie about a man named Jason Bourne(or at least that's one of his names) who is found at the beginning of the movie floating in the ocean, who is alive but has been shot. He doesn't remember who he is, why he got shot or anything else about his past. He finds a chip embedded inside him with a Swiss bank account number on it and he ventures to try and find out who he is. He also has the unique ability to defend himself and is almost computer-like with his self defense mechanisms and he doesn't know why this is either. We find out later that he is being tracked by the CIA and they are trying to get rid of him. This is the basic storyline of the movie, but despite the simplicity of the plot Matt Damon is excellent in the role and is very believable in this character. His cohort and female love interest played by Franka Polente(a German actress), is also very appealing as the drifter who attaches to the wandering anti-hero, carrying some of her own baggage as well. There is a bevy of other capable actors and actresses who co-star and also help the movie. I won't give away any more of the plot for those who want to watch the movie, but that's really about it! Have fun watching it like I did and enjoy this simple but well played story! Watching this definitely makes me look forward to the next installment.",7,0,1,19 December 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Well made qwest movie...
","1st watched 10/24/2009 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-Peter Jackson): Well made qwest movie based on the classic book by J.R.R. Tolkien. This is the first in an obvious trilogy created by Peter Jackson and is made appealing enough to want you to watch the others.(In fact you have to if you want to find out how it ends) The story revolves around a ring originally owned by the evil king of Moldore and has the most power of the 15'ish original ones. This ring is the only one left and is owned by a hobbit named Baggins who passes it down to his son Frodo, played by Elijah Wood. Frodo then skips town so that evil pursuers can't wreak havoc on his native townspeople hoping to get further instructions from the wizard Gandorf. He has to improvise for a little while after getting some help from a ranger but then lets the decision be made by a group of elders of middle earth—who don't decide – and then he makes the decision to take the ring with a group(called the Fellowship of the ring) to the mountain of Moldare to be destroyed(which is the real quest in the movie). This movie has a good pace and really doesn't get boring despite it's three hour length. It has interesting characters who show us their hearts which makes us care about them. Yes, it's an action movie with plenty of that but it's heart is what sells it for me. The effects and settings are well done and the acting is also very good. The obvious non-ending didn't bother me too much knowing that there are two more movies to tell the whole story and it was initially intended that way. Overall, a well done effort by Peter Jackson(former independent Australian director) and his company.",7,0,0,14 November 2009
Man of Steel," Well done re-imagining of the Superman legend...
","1st watched 6/29/2013 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-Zack Snyder): Well done re-imagining of the Superman legend with an excellent portrayal of the new 'man of steel' by Henry Cavill. What makes this movie work is that it gets to the heart of what the character meant to the surrounding earthlings in the story as well as those who experienced it the first time in the DC comics. A moral backbone to a superhuman person that's able to do anything but chooses what's best for all is the 'man of steel's' longtime montra and core of his existence. The movie is fun to watch until the last half hour when it starts to become a typical action flick with one very corny scene that should have never been included referring to the man of steel as 'kind of hot'. I think the filmmakers were trying to infuse a little humor into what up unto that point was fairly serious, but in my opinion it wasn't needed. Overall this is a good piece of filmmaking by Zack Snyder despite the subject being done so many times. He breaks out of the mold with the story a little bit putting some twists to the retelling including a different perspective from the Lois Lane character that might turn off the hardcore fans, but I think in the long run this one did well for the franchise and for the movie-going public.",7,0,1,4 July 2013
Footloose," Fair dance movie...
","1st watched 7/1/2010 -- 4 out of 10 (Dir-Herbert Ross): Fair dance movie with good music and dancing but underdeveloped storyline(that should have been set in the 1950's) that ruins the whole experience. The movie is about a smalltown that abolishes dancing and a few other things after an accident on a local bridge that killed a few kids including the preacher's son. A young pup, played by Kevin Bacon(in a good role for him, actually) arrives in town from Chicago wanting to change things. The preacher is played by John Lithgow(who does a decent job), and has personal reasons for keeping the law in place. His daughter, played by Lori Singer, in some ways is trying to go against her father but in other ways is trying to reach out to him, but can't seem to since the incident. Singer is not very convincing in her role and she just doesn't match up to the other actors as far as her skill level and this weakens the film. The main problem, though, is a script that's inconsistent. The first half of the movie plays like a few MTV moments and outside of the music it's trying to introduce the distance between the characters. The last half tries to bring the characters back together and has more drama, but each half doesn't do a very good job -- although the 2nd half is better. Sure, there's a nice danceable happy ending but you really don't get a feeling like real changes were made. For a summer kids flick this did well, but for the discerning adult this movie doesn't have much appeal. Buy the soundtrack -- enjoy the music and dance to it, but don't worry with the film.",4,1,7,2 July 2010
American Psycho," Dark comedy that is worthwhile...
","1st watched 3/9/2009 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Mary Harron): Dark comedy that is worthwhile but loses it's thunder in the last ½ hour due to the filmmakers turning us in strange directions. The film is basically about a 80's yuppie who has a secret obsession to kill while spouting off reviews of popular 80's music. Christian Bale is wonderful in the twisted role of a VP for a wall street firm who knows how to say all the right things and has the right acquaintances but can't stand it when one of his comrades has a better business card than his. This jeolousy and overly-perfect perspective leads him to kill those who he thinks deserves nothing and anyone who might get in the way of his own ego. He loses his ability to be cool around all this after a detective starts asking him questions about the disappearance of a colleague that he killed. At this point in the movie the dark comedy tries to take a direction towards whether or not Bale's character will make a mistake and be caught. This is where, in my opinion, the movie goes downhill. His 'don't care about anyone' mentality is challenged but is never really taken anywhere. The way the movie ends also doesn't make sense and we're left with a good movie that could have been much better. The movie is unique in it's dry attempt to make fun of this yuppie generation and Bale's portrayal lifts the movie above mediocrity but the lack of a good conclusion lessons the films impact. Still, it's a movie to watch and enjoy for the most part.",6,1,2,13 April 2009
The Shining," Excellent portrayal of descent into madness by Nicholson in this Kubrick directed scary film...
","1st watched 5/28/2001 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Excellent portrayal of descent into madness by Nicholson in this Kubrick directed scary film based on a novel by Stephen King.  What seems to be lacking to make this a great film is some consistency in what was truly possessing Jack to do what he was doing.  We get clues that there was a murder in 1970 at the same hotel, and later that something similar must have happened around 1921 with the strange coincidence that the top dog of the hotel back then looked like Nicholson.  We also have a series of strange hallucinations seen thru the eyes of Shelley Duvall's character that lead us to believe the place has been haunted for awhile.  This type of uncertainty seems to prevail in many of Kubrick's movies so I guess I should have expected this, but it seems that more information(possibly in  King's novel) should have been included.  But as a scary movie, with a knockout performance by Nicholson, as well as most everyone involved,  there ain't too many pictures of this type that beat this.  Sometimes the way to determine whether a scary movie does it's job is if you don't want to watch the movie again -- which happened to me, so I guess Kubrick did what he intended.",7,0,1,28 May 2001

Apocalypse Now," Weird portrayal of insanity that prevailed in different forms by those who fought in the Vietnam wars...
","1st watched 6/3/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Francis Coppola): Weird portrayal of insanity that prevailed in different forms by those who fought in the Vietnam wars.  This is much more than a war movie.  It is about 'the horror'(as Brando's character echoes) that consumes human being when they seek after power and meaning in a totally messed-up world. Coppola usually works with extremes which reveals what he is up to in his movies.  The real star of the movie is Martin Sheen because he is there from beginning to end, although Brando got more attention.  Sheen's character is a man who knows nothing but the war and could not leave to go to any other setting.  He is summoned to hunt down Kurtz in Cambodia(outside of our war zone) and is told that he has lost his senses and is leading a group of natives and basically has become their God.  Sheen and a few navy people head up the Nam river to find Kurtz and run into a few strange people along the way.  One (an officer played by Robert Duvall) is more concerned with surfing than being an officer in the war.  What makes this picture works is that the insanity doesn't end.  Kurtz is found and after Sheen's character spends some time with him, he does his duty.  This is insanity in itself because he realizes that Kurtz is no worse than anyone else when he gets there but does not stop himself.  Weird, long but absorbing movie that tells a great story and deserved more attention than it got.",8,0,0,3 June 2001
The Battle of Algiers," Fascinating portrayal of Algerian revolution...
","1st watched 11/30/2007, 6 out of 10(Dir-Gillo Pontecorvo): Fascinating portrayal of Algerian revolution in the late 50's and early 60's from France's occupied police-rule. This is one of those movies that takes you places American audiences aren't used to seeing and brings you a perspective that is sometimes hard to swallow. This is a very good recreation of a true story about a country of people who will go to all means to bring about their independence including terrorist bombings on innocent people to get their point across. For us, it's initially hard to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys because both groups use similar methods to try and control the other group. The movie starts in the middle of the conflict(it's really not a typical battle) at a point where a member of the rebellion after being tortured gives away the hiding place of the last leaders in the city of Algiers. It then goes backwards to the beginnings of the rebellion and kind of shows how the main core of the group is formed and where they came from. There is an obvious slant toward the Algerian rebels despite some of their not so kosher cleansing process and terrorism tactics, but their oppression from the French government is shown as needed to be toppled at any means. The movie then continues up through the initial scene until the eventual independence that occurs, but not without many casualties. This realistic, documentary-like movie does not back away from actual violence and it's after-effects, but keeps us interested with a linear American-like story. There is definitely a little lacking in the portrayal of the characters at the expense of the story but overall it keeps your interest. The movie is definitely not like most battles, but instead is a calculated series of incidents done by both sides until someone has to give in. Eventually the French find all the leaders in the rebellion in the city, but the rebellion leaks to the countryside where it wins out in 1962. Again, the interest of this movie for me was learning a new society, it's history and it's ways more so than seeing an action-filled movie experience.",6,3,3,30 November 2007
Disturbia," Tittalating yet affective teen-focused thriller...
","1st watched 2/27/2009  6 out of 10(Dir-D.J. Caruso): Tittalating yet affective teen-focused thriller with the newly christened big star, Shia Lebeouf. He's good enough to carry a movie despite his early goofball beginnings with his Disney channel comedy, 'Even Stevens.(which I have to admit I liked) This movie is similar to other peeping tom movies where they see something they shouldn't but this one's a little more complex. Shia's character is on house arrest by punching his teacher after he made a comment about his recently deceased father. After his mom pulls the plug on his xbox, Itunes, and TV he runs out of things to do and starts spying on his neighbors. At first he just entices his hormones by watching a teasing neighbor girl, but then gets interested in a neighbor who appears to be doing questionable things.(like possibly killing a woman he brought home?) He ties his suspicions in with a killer he read about in the newspaper and starts believing this is him. Sarah Roemer is very flirtacious as Shea's lust, I mean love, interest and he also has an Asian friend to do some of his dirty work for him. This group of teens are fun to watch and you never really know if their inklings are true until near the end. Then, of course, you get the good old chase with the main psycho character at the end. Despite the movie's similarities to other movies of this type the movie is fresh and exciting to watch mainly because of the new talent and they play out their characters well. This is not a great movie, but a good one and enjoyable even for an old guy of 44 like me.(OK, maybe it's because I'm an old guy of 44??)",6,0,2,4 March 2009
The Patriot," Ok drama about the reasons for fighting a war, I think...
","1st watched 4/6/2001 - 5 out of 10(Dir-Roland Emmerich): Ok drama about the reasons for fighting a war, I think.  The setting is slightly before America gained it's independence from England in the south. Mel Gibson plays a colonel who has decided that fighting a war is not the best way to gain something, but then changes his mind when the British kill some of his family members and are rather brutal in their methods.  To me this was a confusing film because it's not about Patriotism, it's not a history lesson about the civil war, but rather a way of putting a revenge movie in a different setting.  We are never given enough time or information as to why Gibson doesn't want to fight until after he starts fighting again. I believe the picture was trying to show that love for family should be greater than love for a cause, but I honestly don't think it did a very good job at this either.  Emmerich seems to have a 'hit or miss' directing style and this one for me was a miss.  More dramatic than most of his efforts, but after this he probably needs to go back to mindless effects-filled action.",5,0,2,7 April 2001
Rocky IV," Badly made, weak entry in the series...
","1st watched 5/11/2002 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Sylvester Stallone): Badly made, weak entry in the series places the 'Italion Stallion' against a supposedly invicible Russian fighter 'Ivan Drago' after he kills Rocky's best friend(Apollo Creed) in an exhibition match.  Typical, no holds barred fighting exchanges with just a different opponent with the un-stoppable Rocky batlling back at all times.  Stallone in an attempt to star, write & direct doesn't seem to want to do anything much different with this unbelievable one-sided view of Good Americans vs. Bad Russians.  He attempts to show that even Russians can route for the wonderful good American who never stops, by having the crowd change their chanting for Drago to Rocky midway in their match. Yuck! Gag me with a spoon! Stallone should dump this character and scenario.  It's definetly run it's course by this fourth entry.",2,4,10,11 May 2002
Being John Malkovich," Off-the-wall, sometimes funny, sometimes thought-provoking...
","1st watched 4/12/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Spike Jonze): Off-the-wall, sometimes funny, sometimes thought-provoking trip into how far people will go for eternity.  Yes, the title is `Being John Malkovich' but it's more about  being reborn into another person and therefore living forever.  Cusack plays a puppeteer who can't get work in this profession until he finds a portal in his new job's office that leads him into the title character's mind.  This soon becomes a profitable experience for him and his partner and lust/love interest and they are selling tickets for $200 a pop to enter in.  There is much more to this movie including Cusack's attempt to hold on to his wife and later his girlfriend.  His wife, played by Cameron Diaz, and her trip and discovery into being a lesbian thru Malkovich's mind and much much more.  What makes this movie good is it's complexity although it's direction is confusing.  It starts out as a comedy, but ends as an eerie supernatural thriller.  I believe it would have been a better movie if they would have picked one or the other.   Despite this, the movie is definetly a unique experience to be seen.",7,2,4,12 April 2003

Spider-Man," Well put together playing of the Marvel comic book character...
","1st watched  1/12/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Sam Raimi): Well put together  playing of the Marvel comic book character and his beginnings by Director Raimi.  He made some very good choices in casting including the humble Tobey McGuire as soft-spoken Peter Parker(aka. Spider-man) , and Willem Dafoe as the nemesis Green Goblin.  As someone who was familiar with the original story it was good to see them not overdo it for the screen and pretty much followed the line of the original comic book. The special effects throughout the film was great with almost a video game feel when spider-man flies through the city.  The decision to make the Goblin almost like a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger-like villain is probably the weakest element of the film but this doesn't detract from the appeal of the film overall.  There is also a very well-done on-again off-again romantic element added with Parker, his best friend, Spider-man and the Kirsten Dunst character(kind of a 3 on 1 thing).  There is some very good dialogue spotted throughout the movie which also keeps you grinning and an obvious lead-in to a sequel is thrown in at the end(which is good for us fans.). And of course who can forget the TV theme song to end the film which was a nice added touch tying in another media and it's rendition of the source.",8,0,0,12 January 2003
Ratatouille," Unique & funny computer animated film...
","1st watched 11/28/2008, - (Dir-Brad Bird): Unique & funny computer animated film from Brad Bird & Pixar again takes us to worlds rarely seen. This time it's the world of rats and more precisely a rat who wants to be a cook and create instead of steal like most of the rats do. This breaking out of the nest philosophy isn't unique in films, especially animated movies, but a rat that wants to be a cook is. Humans usually shriek when rats are near food or call the health inspectors but Bird brings us one who not only touches food but makes it wonderfully tasty with it's touch. Bird uses wonderful camera positions to make us feel like we're looking from the rats point of view. This incredible animation along with a very unique story made for an enjoyable movie-going experience. I've basically already outlined the main story but also involved as the patsy or puppet human is a young man who wants to cook but doesn't have the knack for it. He's hired on as a janitor for a world famous restaurant and after botching up the soup recipe he notices a rat putting various ingredients in and the customers love it after his special touch. He's amazed by this and the human gets the credit but he can't duplicate it without the rats help. They scheme together a plan where the rat controls the human through his hat by pulling on his hair to direct him.(OK, so this is a little weird but in animation anything goes) There is a subplot involving the restaurant owner who thinks the boy named Linguini is the original owner's son and is afraid he will inherit the restaurant. This eventually is the case and there are some funny scenes where the owner notices the rats' involvement in the process and others think he is crazy, of course. This is an unusually convoluted plot for an animated movie but this is what makes it enjoyable for adults. Kids will like it too despite this as the movie is an enjoyable experience throughout. Bird & Pixar keep kicking out new material that continues to surprise and they probably will both be at it for a very long time, god willing.",6,0,1,2 December 2008
54," Unspectacular rendition of the 'Studio 54' nightclub...
",1st watched 12/15/2000 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Mark Christopher): Unspectacular rendition of the 'Studio 54' nightclub and it's allure from the perspective of a nobody who becomes a bartender there. Characters don't have much to them and the music is almost non-existent as a force behind this 70's piece of nostalgia.,4,1,3,26 March 2001
The Lego Movie," Un-necessarily complicated and unfunny movie...
","1st watched 3/22/2014 --- 3 out of 10(Dir-Phil Lord & Christopher Miller): Un-necessarily complicated and unfunny movie based on a created Lego world with interesting animation trying to simulate what it would be like if Lego creations were alive. The story is about a normal guy being given the title of savior of a soon to be destroyed world(which is a much used theme). This Lego person named Emmett is a construction worker in a very formalized society who basically has to now think for himself as the savior and new master builder. This is not an easy transition for him and the movie uses this for comedic effect. Will Ferrell provides a voice over of the evil character in the story who wants things to stay the way that they are. Ferrell also has a brief real-life cameo and provides the best thing, in my opinion, in the movie â€“ a song that rolls during the credits about darkness that he ad-libs as he goes. When a credits song is the best thing in the movie than you know it has problems, and this basically is my resolve(it is one big problem). An idea for a movie, complicated and without humor then becomes an overly expensive mess. My question is why was this movie even made ?? I really don't even think kids will get thru the movie without becoming bored. The animation may hold them for a little while but the complications in the plot will drop them from caring very quickly. Avoid this one.",3,6,14,24 March 2014
Aliens," Very good sci-fi action movie...
","1st watched 7/3/2014 -- 8 out of 10(Dir-James Cameron): Very good sci-fi action movie in this second film starring the perfect alien life form created in the original 1979 movie. This movie doesn't try to imitate the original but just makes a good fast moving scary film that gives us more information about the creatures and introduces us to the big mama who is making all the eggs. It starts with Ripley, played again by Sigourney Weaver, and her cat being picked up by a salvage team after flying around for 56 years in space. When she shares her encounter about the Alien species it's initially dismissed, but when they are unable to contact a group of residents living on the planet where the alien ship was first found -- she's asked to join a bunch of marines on a trip to the planet. There are some homages to the original including the initial title screen, and the scene where the crew wakes up from their longtime slumber, but Cameron definitely has his own way of doing things. He doesn't take too long to turn the movie into action fare, but does also a good job of establishing Ripley's motherly instincts that helps us understand her motivation to kick ass later. Newt, a small child lone survivor, becomes kind of Ripley's adopted child since her real child is already deceased. There are a couple of silly dialogued scenes and some unintentional humor brought out from Bill Paxton's character because he is so caricatured, but other than this the movie is well done. Some of the broadly drawn typecast characters are a negative, but Michael Biehn's characters provides a combat person with a heart which is nice to see. Paul Reiser, plays the nice guys who turns bad and we wish it wouldn't happen, but it does. As an action alien movie it would be hard to get much better than this one...so dismiss the character imperfections --- enjoy this, and wait for the next one!!",8,1,2,6 July 2014

Flashdance," Fair simple, rocky-type story...
","1st watched 8/27/2010 -- 3 out of 10 (Dir-Adrian Lyne): Fair simple, rocky-type story about a young woman from Pittsburgh who is a steel worker by day, a dancer by night, and wants to get into a local dance school following the example of her grandmother. Jennifer Beals plays the busy and feisty 18 year old with the dream in this Adrian Lyne directed video-like story. The movie is full of music and video snippets without a whole lot of dialogue and this fills up the movie instead of a story. You never really get a chance to understand the characters because of this choice by the director. You understand what the characters want, but you never really get a fully-developed 'why' for any of the characters. There are some other minor characters that carry dreams as well -- like a cook who wants to be a comedienne at the local bar where the Beals' character dances. So the real purpose of the story is to show you not to stop reaching for your dreams, but the shallowness of the characters do not help you care. Beals is sexy and enticing at times but is never really given much of an opportunity to act, and when she's given it she doesn't do it that well. The boyfriend, played by Michael Nouri, is just an older middle-aged guy honkering for a younger chic and the Beals' character fits the bill for him. So, overall, you have a very shallow movie about reaching your dreams and never giving up that just doesn't quite cut it despite some good music and OK dancing.",3,0,2,31 August 2010

Gone with the Wind," Wonderful portrayal of a couple of people who refuse to be happy...
","1st watched 4/27/2014 -- 8 out of 10(Dir-Victor Fleming): Wonderful portrayal of a couple of people who refuse to be happy in the anti-heroes of Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, and Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivian Leigh. Yes -- the movie is about the downfall of the old South, how people learn to survive thru desperate times, but mostly it's a saddening portrait of lost souls, in my opinion. The movie begins as 2 plantations in the pre-Civil war south live a life of grandeur but it is soon challenged by an inevitable war that threatens to ruin the fantasy world that they lived in -- and thus is 'Gone with the Wind.' Scarlett is a character that is used to getting what she wants due to her prestige or her good looks -- but she definitely can't handle things initially with they don't go her own way. She learns to manipulate and do whatever it takes to attempt to have her needs satisfied but constantly is denied her main pursuit which is trying to get her sister's fiancée to love her, and she pursues this up to almost the end of the movie. Rhett Butler is a wanderer who is really a lot like Scarlett but does eventually learn primarily because of having a daughter. This movie, based on the Margaret Mitchell novel, is mostly about character and shows us the examples of good and bad and the results of each's actions. The good souls are portrayed by Maureen O'Hara and Leslie Howard. Maureen as Scarlett's sister rarely does any wrong and Howard's character continually fight's off his temptations, but the other main characters do very little right. With so much sadness in this movie it's amazing it is so well liked. I believe the deeper meaning comes thru and people cling to that as I did while viewing this very uniquely filmed movie which does some amazing things with shadows with the cinematography overall being excellent. Despite the long length of the movie it keeps your interest, but I believe it would be a hard movie to watch more than once...I'm glad I gave it the once, and I understand why the movie was so critically acclaimed.",8,2,4,1 May 2014
Twilight," Very well executed story about a young girl...
","1st watched 4/16/2009 – 8 out of 10 (Dir-Catherine Hardwicke): Very well executed story about a young girl leaving her mother in Arizona to move in with her father in a small town in the state of Washington and her encounters in this new environment. Her main encounter is with a strange albino-like young boy, played by Robert Pattinson, that appears to be repelled by her at first but she is infatuated by him. The girl, played by Kristen Stewart, eventually finds out that he is part of a family of vampires that just recently moved into the area. He becomes protective of her and has his own fascination because he can't read her mind but can read everyone else's. She falls in love with him and things get a lot more complicated. Upon visiting his family, who survive on the blood of animals instead of humans despite their thirst for this, she is picked up by a tracker(who once smelling a human's blood won't stop til he's made a kill) who belong to another group of vampires who do feast on humans. She then has to run and hide from the tracker without letting her father know what's going on. The movie is really kind of a twisted love story for girls but is also enjoyable for others since the characters are so well played and the story flows so easily. There is definitely more than romance in the story for all types to enjoy as well. There is a side conflict with a local Indian tribe that is introduced near the end of the movie to open up the definite sequel. The ending also more than hints at this. This is definitely OK by me because I'm looking forward to how this story evolves and what else happens to the characters. Yes, I have to admit I'm now just as interested in this series as my daughter who's read the books! This movie is very captivating and expects much money and praise – so go see it!!",8,1,6,22 April 2009

Frozen," Fun, thought-provoking Disney winner...
","1st watched 2/28/2014 – 7 out of 10(Dir-Jennifer Lee & Chris Buck): Fun, thought-provoking Disney winner as they continue the tradition of entertaining animated family-oriented feature films. This is a story about two sisters who are separated from one another at an early age due to the older one's special powers accidentally harming the other. The parents are told to do this to protect the younger one, Anna, by an elder rock-troll after healing her. The parents(who are King&Queen of a town called Arondale) then die in an accident, but the separation is kept in place until the elder of the two sisters is coronated as Queen of the city. During the celebration, the elders ice-creating powers is revealed and she banishes herself up a mountain and unknowingly brings upon a frozen winter-like condition to the area. The movie is based on the Hans Christian Anderson story 'The Snow Queen', which is what she now makes herself isolated from other people. Anna, then decides to seek her out in a quest up the mountain to hopefully reverse the process.(By the waya perfect movie for the horrible 2013-2014 winter season that doesn't want to go awayalthough I don't think Disney knew this was going to happen while making it) This is a song-filled(almost too much so at times) new classic that, in my opinion, doesn't deserve it's PG-rating. The movie even has a meaningful theme by the time it ends, with some added laughs primarily from a re-animated snowman named Olaf, romance, action and some mystery as we try to figure out how the happy ending is going to happen. Some of the plot twists don't make a lot of sense, but this is only a minor flaw to an otherwise well done new Disney film that I'm sure will be enjoyed by families for awhile as it's promoted to home video offerings.",7,1,6,4 March 2014

Ghost Rider," Fun and well-made comic book adaptation...
","1st watched 12/2/2008  (Dir-Mark Steven Johnson): Fun and well-made comic book adaptation that was much better than I expected. I had heard a lot of bad talk about the movie and Nicholas Cage's performance in the title role but it definitely wasn't the case to me. Cage plays the older version of the main character who made a deal with the devil(played wonderfully by Peter Fonda) when he was a young so that his dad would get better. Unfortunately, the devil kills his dad during his next motorcycle stunt and the young ghost rider is stuck with being a helper for the dark one for the rest of his life. He's called to bring back the son of the devil back to hell and from this point on at nighttime he turns into the fiery-skulled character from the comic books. There is a side story about a caretaker(a former ghost rider), played by Sam Elliot, who protects and mentors the younger ghost rider and another side story involving an attempted romantic involvement with an old flame who becomes a reporter, played by Eva Mendes. She just happens to be following and reporting on Johnny Blade, who is a popular stunt rider and Cage's normal daytime character. These extra stories add to the piece, but the basic storyline is really all that is necessary to make this an entertaining movie. Cage's performance is dead-on and this unique storyline makes for a different superhero movie. Sure, Mendes isn't much more than nice to look at and Elliot pretty much plays the same character that he's done in hundreds of movies but overall the movie was a positive experience which I'm afraid won't have a sequel although I'd like to see one",7,3,4,4 December 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Well made 2nd edition in the Lord of the Rings trilogy...
","1st watched 11/22/2009 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-Peter Jackson): Well made 2nd edition in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is perfect in it's technical rendering of the middle Earth world. The characters also have plenty for the viewer to hold onto in this epic battle of good against evil. In this episode, Frodo and Sam are still seeking Moldor to destroy the ring and are following Gollum, played by Andy Serkis with some digital help. There are a couple of side stories as we follow a couple of Hobbits with their tree friends, a couple other members of the fellowship as they try to help Gondor fight off their enemies, and the rising of the wizard of Gondorf. All of the stories follow the same theme of good versus evil and they flow together well despite their complexity. Another amazing technical achievement by director Peter Jackson with an excellent story that doesn't fade throughout the movie. I'm looking forward to watching the final film and will probably weep when it's over because the characters stuck with me so much. This trilogy is up there with the Star Wars films in it's majesty and spectacle and possibly surpasses them.",7,0,1,12 December 2009
I Am Legend," Will Smith end-of-world vehicle falls just short...
","1st watched 7/3/2009, 5 out of 10 (Dir – Francis Lawrence): Will Smith end-of-world vehicle falls just short of being a completely satisfying movie experience. It's definitely an interesting concept with Will's character being the possibly last survivor of a virus brought about by a cancer cure that backfires. He is also a doctor who is still daily working on a cure. The problem with the movie is that it's an obvious attempt to put his face in front of us for 2 whole hours and I get the feeling he wants us to like it. He's a good actor but he can't carry something like this that depends on him solely. There are also human-feeding, night-dwelling, very fast living dead types that come out and he has to protect himself against them. He has learned this and he and his dog have a pretty regimented daily routine. In the daytime they do their shopping(aka. Looting) and search for others who might still be alive and then they board themselves up in the evening. Later he comes across a couple of others who save him and he's egotistical enough to not believe there are others in another location alive. The ending was interesting but still not enough to completely recommend the whole movie.(unless you just can't get enough of Will Smith)",5,1,1,21 July 2009
Back to the Future Part III," Fun and watchable last entry...
","1st watched 12/19/2008 - (Dir-Robert Zemekis): Fun and watchable last entry in the 'Back to the Future' series of movies. In some ways, I actually liked this movie more than the original. This movie provides the first time I ever noticed Christopher Lloyd given a chance to expand his character beyond typecasting and he actually does a very good job with it. His character is given a love interest, who is played by Mary Steenburgen, and he then becomes the main part of the story instead of the Michael J. Fox character. The plot is a twisted mess as usual as it is a time travel story and anytime people move back and forth in time you can never keep track of everything. Of course, this series of movies doesn't take itself very seriously and that's why it works. Its' fun to watch the characters even go so far as making fun of their original characters created in the first movie. An example, is an excellent scene where each character mimics the other by using the other character's patented line. After seeing this, we know we've come full circle in the series. Most of the time in this one is spent in the 1880's(the old west) with Fox's character penning himself as Clint Eastwood and this joke is carried throughout this time period. Doc is a blacksmith(aka. inventor) and their main purpose is getting him back to the future before he's killed in a gunfight. They have to find some way of making the Delorean time machine go at least 88 mph and they use a train to push it up to that speed(with the help of some invention from Doc, of course). Everyone lives happily ever after, as you'd expect, and the series ends on a positive note as far as the movie and how it was received, at least by me.",7,0,0,23 December 2008
Patton," Powerful Oscar-winning performance by George C. Scott...
","1st watched 8/5/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Franklin J. Schaffner): Powerful Oscar-winning performance by George C. Scott carries this film from a so-so war film to a well-done chronicle of the ultimate fighting man. The other performances in the film are not near as convincing, but they really don't need to be because this is a film about Patton from beginning to end. His perspective is always first rather than the war at hand.  The complexity of this man only grazes the surface but Scott's near perfect performance shows some of the perculiaraties of a deeply religious man who uses God's name in vain without flinching.   His belief in reincarnation also rubs against the Bible which he so confidently proclaims that he reads every day to a group of priests in one of his most telling scenes.  For such a great man, his career ends without much fanfair but he will be remembered for a long time because of what he has done.  The movie will also go down in history as one of the better historical biographies alongside Ghandi and others.",8,2,4,5 August 2001

Children of Men," Dreary and bleak future view effectively portrayed...
","1st watched 5/20/2007 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Alfonso Cuaron): Dreary and bleak future view effectively portrayed by director Alfonso Cuaron, although it doesn't make for a fun time at the the movies, it does what it's supposed to do. The story is about a world in the year 2027 that hasn't seen a human birth in 18 years and doesn't have any answers as to why. Clive Owen is a government worker who is mourning with the rest of the world when the youngest person alive dies giving a world with little hope already, less. He is then kidnapped by a group of rebels, led briefly by Julianne Moore's character, who needs help transferring an illegal alien safely out of the country. Illegal aliens are normally captured by the U.K. government and put into refugee camps, but this one needs special treatment because she's carrying a child that could, of course, save the world as they know it. Owen & Moore just happen to be former mates who tried to have a baby 20 years ago unsuccessfully and therefore they are connected personally as well as professionally, and she knows he will be sympathetic to the cause of protecting this woman. The rest of the movie is a qwest to get this important woman to a secret organization known as the Human Project. The tone and the set design for the entire movie is very grey and war-like with very little clues that we're dealing with a future society. This is obviously by design as the director is trying to make a parallel to today's society and what might happen if we continue the direction we're going. This glum look on life is hard to make into an enjoyable movie experience but it does shed some light on reality and opens our eyes to how we can try and make this a better world -- with this Cuoran, accomplishes what he wanted.",6,2,7,21 May 2007
Mission: Impossible II," Catchy action/adventure movie...
","1st watched 5/5/2001 - 6 out of 10(Dir-John Woo): Catchy action/adventure movie from action-director John Woo and big-money making star Tom Cruise.  It has been obvious with John Woo in his directing career that he can keep you going with the action that he directs, but when you can also have good acting and a script that keeps you interested he comes out looking much better.  This movie has enough twists and turns to keep you watching despite long-overdone ending(which is typical of these kinds of movies).  Cruise and Mission Impossible really make a good modern/cool James Bond type which I think can be explored in future movies.",6,0,1,5 May 2001
World Trade Center," Emotionally exhausting and extremely well done...
","1st watched 3/13/2009  9 out of 10(Dir-Oliver Stone): Emotionally exhausting and extremely well done accounting of the personal perspective of two New York cops during the 9-11 disaster. The story is a personal account directly from these individuals and is not intended to be an exhaustive account of the incident and why it happened etc.. This is a little different type of movie for Oliver Stone but he executes it flawlessly. We see how they got involved, John McLaughlin(played by Nicolas Cage in a wonderful downplayed performance), is a Sargeant in the group that goes to the towers to help evacuate the buildings. Will Jimenez, played by Michael Pena, is one of the crew who volunteers to go with John into the lobby between the towers and assist with the goal further putting himself into danger. They get trapped when one of the buildings go down as they jump into the elevator shaft(since it's supposed one of the strongest parts of the building). The rest of the movie revolves around their survival as they humor and get to know one another despite their horrible circumstances. We then jump to scenes with the rescuers and each of the families. This is a personal story despite the grand scale of the event and is done with integrity by all involved. Oliver Stone proves he doesn't have to create a controversy to make a good movie, and this is exactly what he's done here -- except, I dare say, it's a great movie in my opinion that should have gotten more accolades than it did.",9,3,6,18 March 2009
Rudy," Kind of an Indiana film for Football...
","1st watched 12/23/1999 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-David Anspaugh): Kind of an Indiana film for Football, similar to what 'Hoosiers' was for Indiana basketball ironically written by the same screenwriter.  Well done & touching story of a young man's obsession with Notre Dame football and his desire to be a part of it.This film does exactly what it wants to do- nothing more, nothing less.",8,1,2,19 March 2001
Singin' in the Rain," Charming and wonderfully made musical & dancing extravaganza
","1st watched 12/21/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Gene Kelly & Stanley Donen): Charming and wonderfully made musical & dancing extravaganza with a background built on the movie-maker's entrance to talkies.  What makes this movie unique is it's wonderfully staged numbers from 'Singin in the Rain' to wonderfully funny songs with Kelly and Donald O'Conner.  Kelly has a knack for using props and he does this with wonderful results especially in the use of water for the title track.  Oh, if life, we're only as perfect as a musical such as this(then we truly would be singing and dancing in rain, snow, sleet or hail).  Movie magic definetly puts us in this place for this feature which is what gave this picture such a broad appeal and will make it last for a long time in movie history.",8,1,4,21 December 2002
Toy Story 2," Fast-paced fun sequel....
",1st watched 2/14/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-John Lasseter): Fast-paced fun sequel that stands up to the original with no problem. The Toys are back and this time the'yre trying to rescue Woody from going to a museum and being taken away from the love of Andy(his owner).  There isn't a lot different about this except there is the absence of the deranged neighbor kid which is probably for the best and instead the enemy is the owner of Al's Toy Barn who plays in the commercial in a chicken costume. Al steals `Woody' for his collection and Buzz Lightyear and the gang come to the rescue.  Fun for all without any scary elements.,7,0,1,15 February 2003
Chariots of Fire," Excellent character portrayal of two men ...
",1st watched 9/22/2000 - (Dir-Hugh Hudson): Excellent character portrayal of two men hoping to win at the Olympics but approaching it from two different perspectives.(Christian vs. Worldly) Neither perspective is put above the other which helps the movie. Excellent music and camera work also gives us some of the best track & field racing sequences ever on film.,10,0,1,12 March 2001
A Clockwork Orange," Strange futuristic story...
","1st watched 8/10/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Strange futuristic story of a 'ultra' violent gang whose leader goes to jail and is rehabilitated by the government.  His rehabilitation is basically just to make him sick whenever he is about to be violent or have sex. They also made a little mistake in making him sick as well whenever he hears his favorite piece of music(Beethoven's 9th).  There is much controversy about the lewdness of the sexual perversions and the violent beatings that happen in the first half hour of the movie and this is about all we hear from the public, but the movie really becomes interesting after he's caught(at this point the perversion and most of the violence stops.)  The rest of the movie is a sometimes funny, very sarcastic look at how criminals are treated and how our government and ourselves react to varied things like the media and the fate of those who have murdered. There is so much discussion that can follow after this movie ends and I believe that's where Kubrick is when he's at his best.  Just like in '2001;A Space Odyssey'  again he has pricked our minds and our senses to a strange, comic, dark, play on our soceity and given us much to think  about and much to learn from as we look at our present human condition.",8,0,0,11 August 2002
Eyes Wide Shut," Revealing journey...
","1st watched 8/7/2011 – 8 out of 10(Dir-Stanley Kubrick): Revealing journey about what women and men go thru when dealing with sexual infidelity whether it be real or imaginary when couples are married. This last movie by Stanley Kubrick is not perfect, but makes you think while it takes you through one couple's warped experiences after the wife reveals that she was thinking about being with another man sexually during a very important point in their relationship(the couple's engagement). The man, played by Tom Cruise, then has a night where he encounters a prostitute and then a weird sexual cult. He never is unfaithful – just as the wife isn't – but these occurrences in many cases would still split couples up eventually. The deception that Cruise's character has to go through is almost a bigger sin then his encounters and the wife, played by Nicole Kidman brilliantly in a unique part for her, kind of pays for her blatant honesty. The pacing is definitely Kubrick-like(slow and methodical) and not for everyone, and some of the scenes don't make sense -- but overall this is a compelling probe into human sexual existence and how male and females play with it – almost to our own destruction.",8,0,0,9 August 2011
Pretty Woman," Well put together romance...
","1st watched 8/17/2010 -- 8 out of 10 (Dir-Garry Marshall): Well put together romance is one of the better ones in this genre, in my opinion. The story is about a rich man, played by Richard Gere, who's personal life is falling apart and picks up a hooker, played by Julia Roberts, on Hollywood Boulevard initially just to get directions but then ends up keeping her around for a week and of course pays for it. He's the type of person who is married to his job and does it well, and Julia's character works a job where love is out of the question with her clients(no kissing on the lips, basically). They are both hard nuts to crack in different ways but each helps the other to overcome their issues. Although the story is somewhat like a prince rescuing a princess story, it varies in that both parties are really rescuing each other. Garry Marshall, the director, does a good job of telling the story without adding too much cliché-driven jokes or side stories but instead just lets the story happen. Gere and Roberts bring their natural charms to the roles and they are a perfect fit for their characters. I usually don't like sappy endings but this one was really well written and it lifted the movie up to classic status, in my opinion. Bravo to Marshall and the gang for making this movie tasteful yet still for adults.",8,0,1,20 August 2010
Jack Reacher," Disappointing retread of a vigilante-style cop movie...
","1st watched 12/25/2012 – 3 out of 10(Dir-Christopher McQuarrie): Disappointing retread of a vigilante-style cop movie with Tom Cruise producing and starring, and again showing me that when a star gets too involved in a project it goes to his head. Cruise stars as the lead character, Jack Reacher, who is a former military intelligence person who doesn't go by the rules when going after his prize(aka. Dirty Harry, Charles Bronson in a bunch of movies and others). The interesting part is that it takes forever for us to understand that this movie is a retread of those types because of it's mystery story approach as we try to determine who's at fault for the initial shooting, and it's consistently confusing us all the time(which for me—was not a good thing). There are some good chase scenes and, of course, lots of rough violent scenes(I'm amazed this movie got a PG-13 rating because of this). Considering this was released shortly after the Connecticut school killings and being about a shooter of innocent folk just walking about around Pittsburgh – it should be box office poison, but from the ending it appears Cruise is attempting to have sequels but I personally don't think this is going to happen, or at least shouldn't.",3,28,56,27 December 2012
The Da Vinci Code," OK mystery-drama from Director Ron Howard...
","1st watched 1/7/2009 (Dir-Ron Howard): OK mystery-drama from Director Ron Howard. With all the hype leading up to this movie you'd think that Ron Howard was removed from the good-old-boy club due to him movielyzing issues that question Jesus and the Christian doctrine. The problem is that this has been done before with other movies like 'Last Temptation of Christ' and others without all the hoopla because those movies weren't mainstream. Despite this, the movie has to be reviewed for it's merit as a movie instead of what it reveals that's shocking. The movie is basically a quest for the holy grail and answers to who Jesus really was; a Deity or just a man. A secret society is supposedly holding this answer and making it secretive and a grand master of the cult tries to reveal the answers to his niece before his death. Where the Tom Hanks character comes in, is that he reads religious symbols and is brought in to help determine why this man died and who killed him. The movie is not unlike adventures like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'National Treasure' except the answers could bring down a religion. Audrey Toutau plays the niece who finds out more about why she's involved the longer the movie goes forward. The chemistry between Toutou and Hanks isn't that great and since they are the main characters it makes the movie less interesting. The revelations about Christ's possible mortality and descendants is kind of presented as just part of a mystery and therefore isn't that shocking. The movie is entertaining to a point, but nothing new. All the hype, again, doesn't make for a good movie --- but it's not bad, just not good enough to recommend.",4,3,7,13 January 2009
Titanic," Excellent big movie, for a big event...
","1st watched 8/6/1998 - 10 out of 10(Dir-James Cameron): Excellent big movie, for a big event involving a big boat with directing of Titanic proportions(stop me please!!).  Tremendous detail on Titanic's sinking with a believable love story attached.",10,2,4,23 March 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Inventive fantasy film...
","1st watched 11/20/2001 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Chris Columbus): Inventive fantasy film that appeals to young school-age kids in many different ways.  As I watched this movie in the theatre, surrounded by middle school kids, I understood  why they are captivated by this character, Harry Potter.  Not having read any of the books, but only having brief information fed to me by  my 9-year old I was unprepared for what this movie was really about.  I believe this character appeals to kids because #1 - he's from a broken home (like many young kids today), #2 - he's fighting against the evils of the world everyday(like many kids are at this age - trying to figure out what's right and wrong), #3 - it's fun (there was a tremendous game played at Hogwart's where the characters are flying on broomsticks where the pace is very fast like many video games that kids play today), #4 - the class mentality displayed at Hogwart's(similar to school rivalry's just blossoming with kids these days), and finally #5 - Harry wins and wins by playing by the rules(most of the time).  This is even fun  to watch for old-timers like myself (even though I had to get tips from my 9-year old every once in a while about what was happening on-screen, which she gave me unsolicited every couple minutes).  All in all this movie is basically a good time had for all.  Not taken seriously it is very appealing to people of all ages.",7,0,0,22 November 2001
The Untouchables," Well put together film...
",1st watched 4/21/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Brian DePalma): Well put together film about the Elliot Ness/Al Capone battle that took place in Chicago during prohibition.  What makes this film work is the style it is made in with good performances by Robert Deniro & Sean Connery in supporting roles.  There are some wonderfully photographed action sequences and good development in the story that keeps the movie interesting and keeps us routing for the good guys despite it's lacking in depth.,7,3,7,21 April 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Over-blown attack on the senses...
","1st watched  5/26/2003 - 3 stars (Dir-Andy & Larry Wachowski): Over-blown attack on the senses.  To me, what this sequel does is take an interesting idea and screw it up by  overloading our senses with pictures, action and sound.  I was so distraught by watching this movie and trying to figure out what it was all about that I really didn't want to watch it to the end.  I was able to take a couple bathroom breaks and the theatre had a few false fire alarms which made it a little more bearable, I guess.  And what's worse is that they end it with a `To be continued.' (which means, of course, that I may have to bear this again).  I'm sorry but I didn't like the first one and I don't like this one either.  What makes movies interesting to me is the stories not wondering how they accomplished the technical things.  This is the only thing interesting about this movie(the special effects- the wow, how did they do that? thought), but by the end your saying - who cares?  As you can see, I didn't care for this but I have to admit that the effects were spectacular(even Oscar-worthy).",3,1,2,29 May 2003
Die Hard," Excellent action picture with humor...
","1st watched 4/14/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-John McTiernan): Excellent action picture with humor and well-played good guy by Willis and bad guy by Alan Rickman.  This director has a flair for keeping you on your toes and also making the characters smart.  Willis is not just a killer, but a smart maneuverer and the fact that Rickman is pretty much the same makes for a wonderful cat and mouse game.  One of the best of this type of movie ever made.",8,1,3,14 April 2002
Psycho," Scary and strange classic Hitchcock movie...
","1st watched 1/27/2009 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): Scary and strange classic Hitchcock movie provides plenty of reasons to watch and enjoy. Janet Lee plays a woman who decides to steal a large sum of cash and escape with it. The problem is she stops off to stay at the Bates Hotel overnight(which was definitely a mistake) and runs into the Bates family -- or at least it appears this way. Anthony Perkins is excellent as the disturbed son of the messed up family who covers up for his supposed mother's mistakes in the true good son fashion. The mystery behind the movie is determining who did the evils to Janet and others in the Bates Hotel. Hitchcock brilliantly keeps us guessing til the end as well as providing the shocks that we expect from the movie. This is the ultimate weird family scary movie that others have tried to imitate(some well and some badly), but they never match the excellent direction done by the master storyteller. There is the much imitated shower scene, but the overall movie in general is well written and put together and the one scene shouldn't make the entire movie(which it doesn't here). Viva La Hitchcock!! You have done it again!!",7,0,0,30 January 2009
Hercules," OK Disney animated feature...
","1st watched 3/28/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir-John Musker & Ron Clements): OK Disney animated feature about the son of the great Zeus and his silly adventures. This a kind of wannabe A-list Disney movie with it's attempts at songs, sidekicks and silly romances but it just doesn't quite hit the mark despite James Woods doing a good job with the Hades role. The movie is about the birth of the young boy to Zeus and his wife, his loss of his godly position at the hands of Hades, and his attempt to become a mortal hero to win back his spot with the other Gods at Olympus. His road to hero-dom isn't easy as he's a pretty clumsy goof at first, but he's given a hero trainer voiced by Danny Devito who's kind of a short devil-like character(why he trained hero's I don't know??). He becomes a hero but supposedly still misses the heart necessary to get back to Olympia. This is gained, of course, because he goes googly-eyed over a women who is one of Hades's helpers and does stuff to get her out of his clutches(yeah I know, this doesn't make sense but it's Disney not Shakespeare). The movie is narrated by a 60's like Gospel group, who end every song with 'the gospel truth.' I'm sure this didn't make the religious right very happy about this movie(but they never really made movies for them anyway—but don't tell 'em). All in all, the movie is watchable but not the kind of Disney fare that we've come to expect from them. The same formula just not executed as well as some of their other movies.",4,7,12,2 April 2009
30 Days of Night," Disturbing and scary vampire/zombie-like scarefest...
","1st watched 1/15/2009, (Dir-David Slade): Disturbing and scary vampire/zombie-like scarefest about a foreign speaking group of bloody folks who overtake a town in Alaska during the 30 days of night experienced by this area during every winter. The small group left to fight or hide(really) from the predators all know each other, of course, because they live in a very small town. The sheriff, played by Josh Hartnett, is also the leader and makes the decisions necessary to survive. This type of movie definitely has been done before and in some ways it resembles 'Night of the Living Dead' movies, except the vampire/zombies are more disgusting and speak(although it's in a foreign tongue  from what country we don't know). It's also similar to this movie in that the survivors realize that waiting things out is better than blasting the ghouls with a bunch of firepower. If they wait 30 days then the sun will come and burn them up and they're used to the winters around there so it shouldn't be that difficult, right?? Well it's not that easy and, of course, we get many opportunities to see the creatures suck the blood and devour their next victim. I guess the reason I liked this movie is because it does what it intended to do,, scare you!! The creatures aren't that smart --- for some reason they don't check the attics where the people are hiding out and they aren't that unique when it comes to movie creatures but they are scary. This one factor is really what measures these type of movies, so if you can handle the blood and gore, enjoy it!!",6,1,2,16 January 2009
American Gangster," Good crime story based on a true story...
","1st watched 4/22/2009 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Ridley Scott): Good crime story based on a true story about a drag trafficking African American man, played by Denzel Washington, in the late 60's who started a heroin business smuggling drugs from Vietnam through military personnel. He worked with his cousin to find the purest form of the drug and get it smuggled in shipments to the U.S. and employed others in his family to distribute it. He formed a company around his family similar to other mafia groups and used some of the same violent tactics to keep himself on top. Russell Crowe plays a detective who puts together a group to sniff out the drug lords and the characters run parallel to each other in the story until near the very end. The story is gritty and told well with good acting although there's not a lot of positive things to hang onto(I guess that's the nature of the story, though). The matter-of-fact way of storytelling works at times but not at others. The movie is slow at the beginning but it eventually pulls you in and gains your attention. I also like the way the director showed how each character didn't really receive their due rewards till the very end. The good guy had bad times and the bad guy lived it up most of the movie which is unfortunately more the way it is in real life. The ending is a little bit corny when the characters hook up to put bad cops in jail, but I guess they had to throw in something positive. All in all this was a good movie, but not great.",6,0,1,22 April 2009
Stranger Than Fiction," Well executed comedy-drama...
","1st watched 10/14/2008 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Marc Forster): Well executed comedy-drama about a man who's life is really just a character in a book that is currently being written. Will Farrell brilliantly underplays the main character as he goes thru his mundane life as an IRS agent, but then suddenly starts hearing a voice narrating his every move. He first goes to a shrink that thinks he's schizophrenic and suggests pills but then suggests visiting a literary teacher played by Dustin Hoffman. The teacher tries to help him figure out what kind of story he's involved in. Hoffman plays the role brilliantly like most of the cast. The only downspot in the casting is Queen Latifah as the novelist's assistant. She doesn't do well underplaying, and just doesn't bring much to her role. Emma Thompson is wonderful as the voice in Will's head who eventually meets up with the character. The music and pacing is very well done and the movie even makes you think as well as being comedic. A storyline like this is bound to have a few flaws, but overall the execution makes up for it and the experience of viewing the movie was fun and thought-provoking with even a little romance added in to spice things up. I am definitely looking forward to this director's next movie and it also showed the acting ability of Will Ferrell when given good material.",8,0,0,17 October 2008

WALL·E," Excellent animation movie with a message...
","1st watched 10/10/2009 – 8 out of 10 (Dir-Andrew Stanton): Excellent animation movie with a message. The story revolves around a world left in ruins to be cleaned up by robots(aka. Wall-E's) while the humans find refuge in an outerspace station where they are pampered and grow fat. Wall-E is getting a little bored of his routine where he day-in and day-out turns refuge into blocks and disposes of it. He gathers relics(similar to Ariel in 'Little Mermaid') to make his time more interesting and has a friend in a roach with antenna's. Then arrives another robot searching for plantlife for the humans named Eve. Wall-E becomes infatuated with her but her prime directive is notifying the humans when she finds a plant and then staying in the spot until they return to pick her up. The idea here is when she finds it, they can come back to Earth to re-colonize. There is very little dialogue in this movie yet we understand the emotions of the characters, which shows us how amazing the animation is by the Pixar people here. There is a lot of slapstick similar to old Warner Brothers cartoons giving us plenty of laughs with a plus being a message about us taking care of our motherland, the Earth. This is a real step up for a cartoon studio and it's all done really well. It's amazing how such a small idea was expanded out to make this very well done movie. Another triumph for Pixar as they pick up from Disney's ways to rule the animation world in the movies of this current time.",8,1,3,11 November 2009
Carrie," Excellent horrorfest which raises above every attempt to imitate...
","1st watched 12/10/2006 - 9 out of 10(Dir- Brian DePalma): Excellent horrorfest which raises above every attempt to imitate that followed. Brian DePalma does an excellent job of building up the suspense leading up to the prom thru slow motion, split camera effects, music, brilliant close-up shots and excellent direction even when you know what the final outcome is going to be. This movie started a series of Stephen King efforts brought to the big screen but for me the real star was the director. No other modern director could have done what DePalma did with this material, in my opinion. The movie is about an oppressed young girl, played by Sissy Spacek, who is made fun of because of her inability to fit in with those around her. Most of the problem is because of her bible-toting overbearing mother who chooses to close her eyes to the real world and blame everything on sin and the devil. Carrie, as she is known in the movie, in the meantime is starting to discover her telekinetic powers and is physically becoming a woman as well(which is seen by all in the famous shower scene that opens the movie). A few folks at her school are on her side and try to bring something positive in her life by hooking her up on a date to the prom. The problem is that others are scheming to setup a disaster but are unaware of Carrie's abilities to take revenge upon them. The rest of the movie, I'm going to leave up to you to see. Again, DePalma masterfully hooks us thru excellent characterizations, story and build-up in what I consider one of the best movies of this kind ever made.",9,3,5,10 December 2006

Shrek," Funny anti-Disney...
","1st watched 2/27/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Andrew Adamson & Vicky Jenson): Funny anti-Disney, anti-cute fairy tale, computer animated, ugly ogre wins all story.  This starts out from the beginning as a big slap in the face to the usual Disney princess gets rescued by the handsome prince charming with many references to that other animation studio throughout.  And Dreamworks truly has gone another direction by adding some adult humor, cursing, and even sex references to it's recent movies like this and the well-made but overlooked Antz.  It's still ok for kids, but also bearable for adults and that's where I think they have really got something different in the way of animation.  There is also a lot of great music whether it's a remake or a new tune(for the most part not sung by the characters but a background to the story.)  All in all this movie is a pretty fun way to spend an hour and a half with a pretty basic story but humorous and entertaining throughout.",7,1,2,27 February 2002

Casino Royale," OK, action-filled Bond movie...
","1st watched 3/31/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Martin Campbell): OK, action-filled Bond movie with usual over-the-top action but with very little humor to give the viewer a break. Daniel Craig is fine and manly enough for the role and he also adds a little more edginess to the sometimes placid character to make him more complex for the modern movie going audience but doesn't add much in the humor area. Because of the nature of these films, the added humor is important and we don't get much here. There is a short romantic interlude that doesn't last very long(because you know--Bond's girls usually don't last very long in the plot--poor James!!) The movie is like a 2 and ½ hour roller coaster ride for the most part which just overwhelms the viewer who can't wait for things to slow down. I came into this movie expecting good things because of what I've heard and read about the movie but left disappointed. I really believe that Bond movies should be a thing of the past now that the material(the Ian Fleming books) have already been used up but they keep giving us more. And I guess as the audiences poor in we'll get remakes and more remakes just to keep the series going----sigh",4,1,2,1 April 2007

Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Well-made chronicle of the protestant Queen Elizabeth I ...
","1st watched 12/16/2007, 7 out of 10(Dir-Shekhar Kapur): Well-made chronicle of the protestant Queen Elizabeth I and her struggles against Catholic Spain as well as her innermost struggles of being the 'virgin' queen. Cate Blanchett once again does a good job of portraying the complexities in this historical character and let's us see what many probably didn't get to see in her day(which of course were her private struggles amplified in this film). The movie is partly about the entrance of Sir Walter Raleigh in her life, played by Clive Owen, who is a swashbuckling handsome type from Spain who comes to get on the Queen's good side and permission for his exploring, but instead tickles her fancy and the Queen would like to have him in other ways. The other part of the story is the conflict between Spain and England and how it got it's start. Sir Walter falls for one of her suitors which causes the queen knipchens and makes her make irrational decisions like denying Walter's exploration and keeping him around as captain of the guard, in hopes that things might happen between them eventually. This is where the story is interesting. The war part, in my opinion, is not done very well and just brings down the movie. Elizabeth is very successful historically in this area, but in the movie she gets help from Sir Walter and her expertise in this area is not expanded or portrayed very well. For the most part, though, this is an entertaining and well executed movie with good acting and interesting conflicts. One suggestion though --- hone up on your history before watching it, as I didn't, and you may understand the movie a little better.",7,1,2,18 December 2007
The Deer Hunter," Absorbing drama about friends ...
","1st watched 3/18/2000 -  (Dir-Michael Cimino): Absorbing drama about friends from a Pennsylvania steel town before, during and after the Vietnam war.Tremendous performances lead you into the lives of the characters and make you want to stay to know how things went after the movie.",10,1,2,12 March 2001
Identity," Complex psychological thriller...
","1st watched 3/20/2004  - 7 out of 10(Dir- James Mangold): Complex psychological thriller that ends up being a story-within-a-story. I don't want to give away too much so all I'm going to say is that this is a well-done scary movie that starts out as a drama about a bunch of people and how they end up stopping at the same motel and then 1-by-1 those that are present start dying.  Eventually we find out that they all have something in common(I'll leave that for the viewer).  The director does a good job of re-directing our focus so that we have no idea what's going on until the final surprise half-hour.  Known for his cop movies, this is a departure for him but he does an excellent job with the material.  The acting is credible enough but it's the story that's really the star in this movie.  It's similar to a TEN LITTLE INDIANS type of plot but it doesn't go the same direction.  All-in-all this is scary well-done escapism with a twisted ending.",7,0,0,21 March 2004
Speed," Exciting but predictable action gimmick movie...
","1st watched 9/7/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir- Jan De Bont): Exciting but predictable action gimmick movie is OK if you like these kind of movies, I guess. After seeing so many of these no-holds-barred, action-without-cease movies, you start knowing what's going to happen next and then it's over. The premise of this one surrounds around a man who wants money but is challenging the L.A. police department's bomb squad at the same time, for some reason(we find out later why). The enemy is played by Dennis Hopper and he isn't given much to work with in the role(he's a typical scumbag). The good guy(played by Keanu Reeves) is a maverick cop who gets in the way of him making his money after he puts a bomb in an elevator and it backfires. Sandra Bullock becomes the driver of the bus that has to stay going fifty miles an hour or it blows up(the 2nd challenge to the bomb squad). The cop knows what's going on and tries to save everyone as a maverick cop would normally do(especially if played by Keanu Reeves). There are a lot of holes in the silly plot and in my opinion, that' s why the movie doesn't work. Sure it's exciting, but the story behind it doesn't really come across as very believable. Also, technically there are some issues -- like background scenes behind the bus going way too slow for the bus to be going 50 miles per hour. This happens way too often. Sure, it's only a movie, but you'd think the director would think the audience might pick up on this. Something other than the action has to pull us in as well, and it doesn't. The actors aren't given much opportunity to act and the character's are not fleshed out at all. So we go home as an audience not really learning anything except we know we've been on a roller coaster ride for 2 hours(and I for one don't like roller coasters). If you like roller coasters, you might like this one--maybe.",4,3,6,9 September 2009
Thor: The Dark World," Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart...
","1st watched 12/4/2013 – 5 out of 10(Dir-Alan Taylor): Technically superb Thor sequel that is missing a heart or a reason to care. Visually this movie has a lot to offer, but about halfway thru a realization comes that the fluff isn't enough to sustain a seasoned movie-goer. I had a similar reaction to the Harrison Ford epic 'Blade Runner' and other movies that have a lot of style, but very little heart. The story revolves around a matter hidden deep beneath the Earth called 'Ether' that can change compositions quickly and is sought after by an evil elf-like creature from a world before there was light, Aka. The Dark World. He believes this Ether has the power to bring back his world. Natalie Portman, plays Jane Foster, a companion of Thor and a scientist – who comes upon this substance during an investigation and it possesses her. The evil creature is then after her and Thor(played by Chris Hemsworth), and he, of course, wants to protect her. The settings in the movie consist of Asgard – ruled by Thor's father Odin(played by Anthony Hopkins), London, and the dark elves' world.the movie jumps back and forth between these worlds partially because of a weird warp found during the investigation that transfers items across these worldsbut Thor seems to be able to go in and out no matter what. There is plenty of action to be had, decent acting, and a little humor but other than the expected battle between good vs. evil there is no real reason or emotion to stay with the movie to the very end. The movie should probably win some visual effects awards, but I'm looking for a complete experience and in my opinion – this isn't one. It is a good try but not quite good enough for my approval.",5,8,12,6 December 2013
Amélie," Quaint little piece about a sheltered French girl...
","1st watched 10/11/2014 – 7 out of 10(Dir=Jean-Pierre Jeunet): Quaint little piece about a sheltered French girl named Amelie, played by Audrey Toutou, who attempts to turn her dreamlike life into reality through following a path of doing good deeds after finding a young boy's memory box behind a wall in her room. Her good deeds start happening after she delivers the memory box to the grown-up person --- who then pursues his ignored daughter and grandson. The complexity of this story and it's characters are actually too much to discuss in this short review – but I'll do my best. Her adventures start as a young child who loses her mother and is left with a father who does not relate to people, and therefore keeps her locked up as well until she is able to move away. She then tries to pursue life and love despite her faults and this movie portrays this journey. She works as a waitress in a local bar and is helped in this journey by an elderly painter who lives in her building. A mishmash of characters are introduced telling us their likes and dislikes showing us the director has a backstory for everyone of them. The one that Amelie eventually pursues is a man who has supposedly had the opposite experience in life by having too many people in it. He keeps a scrapbook of folks who take pictures in airport picture kiosk's and is obsessed with this. Her positive approach to branching out also benefits her in a personal way as she changes herself also -- before the end of the movie. This is more of a light comedy than a deep serious piece, but there is definitely meaning behind it the film. The dreamlike approach taken by the filmmaker makes it so you never know what's going to happen next and this is part of the joy in the film. This is a definite gem that should be treasured by moviegoer's throughout the world and hopefully opens the world up to this kind of cinema.",7,0,1,11 October 2014
The Sixth Sense," Good psychological thriller with a surprise ending...
","1st watched 3/2/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-M. Night Shyamalan): Good psychological thriller with a surprise ending.  This is a well-told story about a boy  who `sees dead people', and is counseled by the Bruce Willis's character in an attempt to do better than he had done before with a similar child.  The best things about this movie are the pacing and the way the director moves us through the story and the performance by Haley Joel Osment as the boy.  Willis does his usual good  job, but Haley is superb. I won't give away the ending because I shouldn't, but in a way I'm kind of tired of surprise ending that throw the whole story out of sync and this is really my only real gripe about the movie.  Other than this, it is a very well done first effort for writer/director Shyamalan, which of course, brought about more to come for him.",7,0,0,2 March 2003

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Lesser sequel to the original Hunger Games movie...
","1st watched 11/22/2013 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Francis Lawrence): Lesser sequel to the original Hunger Games movie doesn't have the bite or allure of the original. The setup and lead-in to the games is very flat and sometimes downright corny. The viewer also doesn't see the purpose behind everything that is happening as clearly as with the original. There is really nothing terribly wrong in the performances with Jennifer Lawrence in the lead as Kat, but the direction doesn't seem to pull in the emotions or necessity for the story. The main characters emotions are very evident – almost too much so – but the other characters are pretty bland as far as their direction towards their purpose. The story starts with Kat being called out of her hunter's life to leave her current boyfriend to go on a victor's tour with her winner & co-partner for her zone – which quickly becomes a tournament to cover up the actual turmoil and possible revolution in the real world. The game provides a little bit of puzzle solving as it is setup like a clock, but not enough to make it very interesting or much fun. There is a hardness to this movie that is actually pretty tough to take in – a world that makes the normal folk kill each other as entertainment for some reason that is not real clear. Overall this is a just a pretty un-satisfactory movie experience for a franchise that promises at least two more movies.hopefully they pick up their game or it will lose it's audience despite the book series popularity.",4,35,72,26 November 2013

Godzilla," Amazing adventure monster movie ...
","1st watched 5/31/2014 – 8 out of 10(Dir-Gareth Edwards): Amazing adventure monster movie where the main attraction is the monsters and the humans are just along for the ride. I'm not saying the movie doesn't have a good human story that keeps you interested – it does, but we understand who's in control when the movie is over and I think that was the original intention of the Godzilla legend when it was created in 1956. This 2014 version is visually almost perfect and has a storyline that keeps you interested with a twist making Godzilla not necessarily the enemy of mankind. Early in the movie some other monsters are discovered hatching in a couple of areas of the world being disguised as seismic activity, and they start feeding off the energy sources around them. Some of the Japanese folk are aware of Godzilla's existence and these occurrences happening before – so they are called in for assistance. An American who used to work for a company that originally discovered the first monster believes this 2nd occurrence is a cover-up and him and his son, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, become involved. Godzilla is then awakened basically because these creatures can upset the order of nature including destroying mankind but also being higher on the food chain then the before mentioned Godly, King of the Monsters. The creators of this film, with Director Gareth Edwards, have now re-awakened the classic monster movie and upgraded it for this generation not necessarily because of the special effects, but because of the great storytelling. The monsters are not really that unique conceptually for this age(I even wondered if Godzilla was partially played by a man in a suit like some of the early films but don't believe it was), but a lot of care was taken in making the story unique and quick-paced. I don't believe those connected with the genre will be disappointed and neither will newbies. An overall triumph despite the many different variations of these movies that have been made over the years from this classic monster.",8,1,3,6 June 2014

Cube," Unique film...
","1st watched 3/24/2001 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Vincenzo Natali): Unique film about people who find themselves trapped in a contraption that turns out to be somewhat like a moving Rubik's cube. Personalities clash, people change both from good to bad and bad to good, from worthless to having much worth while the cube continues it's consistent pattern.  The people are left to figure out this puzzle.  The movie is worth something because it is very thoughtprovoking and you wonder what the thinking is behind the makers of this film. The playing out of the film is sometimes ok, sometimes not, but that doesn't really matter because there seems to be a bigger purpose to this whole thing(maybe).",6,1,2,23 March 2001

Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Hilarious Monty Python comedy...
","1st watched 6/31/2001 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Terry Gilliam & Terry Jones): Hilarious Monty Python comedy that slows down on the laughs about 3/4 of the way thru but overall displays their unique style of comedy better than any of their movies that I've seen.  In this movie, they also don't seem to be extremely concerned with disgusting their audience but rather making them laugh.  The 'Meaning of Life' had many disgusting scenes and 'Life of Brian' wanted to slap religion in the face from beginning to end.  Here we get British comedy at it's best with Python's weird mix of animation, live action, and interaction with the audience of some sort.  There are many memorable scenes which could be viewed again and again and still be funny. This is what makes this a classic comedy in every sense.",7,0,0,1 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Formidable 5th entry in the stars wars saga...
","1st watched 7/23/2005 - (Dir-Irvin Kershner): 6 out of 10 Formidable 5th entry in the stars wars saga, keeps the story moving pretty nicely with good character building of the friendships between the main three and add a 4th in Lando Calrissian who can only be somewhat trusted. Introduced are many well-done stop motion animation sequences and Yoda created by the Jim Henson people and the voice being his counterpart, Frank Oz. What this movie does(which was originally the 2nd star wars film) is takes the good formula of the space cowboys epic and gets you to care about the people involved. A nice little love triangle is hinted at between Leia, Han and Luke and the bantering between the stars seems more natural than in the 1st movie. We are also setup for the next entry with a rather hokey ending but nevertheless the movie, for the most part, is fun like the original with slightly different settings, and the same battle between the good side of the force(the rebels) and the dark side(the empire) with Darth Vader taking over greater control and becoming more obsessed with his personal issues(mainly the turning of Luke to the dark side). We know this battle will continue and this movie helps us look forward to this if nothing else.",6,0,8,23 July 2005

Incredibles 2," Action-based CGI entry from Pixar doesn't have much more than this...
","1st watched 8/12/2018 :
Action-based CGI entry from Pixar doesn't have much more than this, and therefore disappoints. In this sequel, the movie starts with 'Super Heroes' being against the law, and the family trying to hang as 'just' a family. A high-falooting business man has an idea to bring them back in the fold and hires the mom(because she destroys less stuff) to do some work to help turn the tides on the idea of bringing them back. Therefore dad has to do some of the normal mom stuff like taking care of a baby who has newfound powers. For some reason - Pixar added very little humor to this movie. The baby did some funny things, but that was about it. There was some unique animation(including one seen with the evil character) which could invoke seizures in some, but sorry that's not enough for a good movie. I have seen a lot of action scenes, and pretty much anything can be done in computer animation so it's ho-hum if there is not a story you want to follow and characters you care about. This had neither. A lot of time and effort was put into creating this sequel, but in my eyes it wasn't worth it.",4,1,2,16 June 2020
Gladiator," Overly rated but good action/drama...
","1st watched 5/7/2001 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Ridley Scott): Overly rated but good action/drama from director Ridley Scott.  The cinematography was great, and Joaquin Phoenix as the Caesar was excellent(which should have won him an Oscar), but of course Crowe won for an ok performance as best actor.  The film was directed well by Scott, but our appeal to the characters was lacking as opposed to a similar Oscar winner in 'Braveheart' in that it had a lot of violence but Gibson was wonderfully captivating where Crowe was again just ok.  It seems like Oscar always tends to like a overly-produced epic know matter how good it is these days.  I hope that it returns to simple storytelling for it's best picture winners (aka. Chariots of Fire, Driving Miss Daisy etc...) in the future.",6,0,1,6 May 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Fun action and witty dialogue abound...
","1st watched 4/6/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Steven Spielberg): Fun action and witty dialogue abound in this final(we think...) episode in the Indiana Jones three-some.  What this movie lacked as far as special effects it didn't lack in the witty charm brought to the screen by the pairing of Connery & Ford.  From the very beginning to the end it's hard to keep your eyes of the screen following these outrageous adventures and that's the allure of this series.  This film actually tried to put some serious spiritiual overtones into the storyline by searching for the Holy Grail(the cup that Jesus drank from at the last supper) and the myth that it would give everlasting life to those who drank from it.  There are the usual puzzles and hoops that Indiana has to go through to finish this journey(which make no sense from a realistic perspective), but it's obvious from the very beginning that we're watching an un-realistic hero in a movie and that's okay.  All in all this one is a fun ride for the movie-goer which is the ultimate purpose in this one by the ever-entertaining Steven Spielberg.",7,3,4,6 April 2002
Back to the Future," Silly and corny, but likeable and sometimes funny...
","1st watched 5/5/2002 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Robert Zemeckis): Silly and corny, but likeable and sometimes funny time travel comedy.  A major hit when it first came out which I think had more to do with how well it was marketed then how good of a movie it was.  Michael J. Fox carries the film with his charm and his ability to do physical comedy.  The story jumps back and forth from serious to silly which keeps us giggling and the good guys win in the end which usually makes for a winner at the box office. The focus of most of the comedy has to do with Michael trying to get his parents together despite his unexpected intervention into their lives and being his mom's flame for awhile putting a damper on his real mom and dad getting together.  It all works out in the end of course and we're ready for part ii in the series which is predicted by the 'To be continued...' as the credits roll.",6,5,29,5 May 2002
The Birds," Strange yet hypnotic psychological horror movie...
","1st watched 3/9/2007 - 6 out of 10(Dir-Alfred Hitchcock): Strange yet hypnotic psychological horror movie from the never predictable Alfred Hitchcock. The movie starts out as the lead character, played by Tippi Hedren, meets the male lead in a pet store and then begins an almost stalker-like obsessive trek to find this man(ala. Jimmy Stewart going after Kim Novak in Vertigo except the sexes are reversed). Once she finds him in a small bay town and gives his sister a gift of two love-birds, the local birds start acting strange; first attacking her and then everyone and everything else. Along the way, we find out bits & pieces about many of the character's lives turning it into a bit of a drama until the final attacks of the birds in the last third of the movie. At this point it becomes more of a standard horror flick until the end. The question keeps coming up about why the birds are doing this and why now?? We never find this out and the movie ends extremely abruptly lending us to wonder what this was all about. Despite this, the movie does more than most movies these days -- it keeps your attention. Hitchcock seems to always be able to do this no matter what the subject is. This time it just happens to be birds and relationships in a small bay town, the next time maybe a weirdo in a hotel??",6,0,4,10 March 2007
Princess Mononoke," Complex and slow-moving battle between humans and the forest gods...
","1st watched 9/12/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir- Hayao Miyazaki): Complex and slow-moving battle between humans and the forest gods didn't really play that well to me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm not that in tune with the Japanese culture, but I just have to call things as how I see them and this animated movie by famed director Miyazaki didn't cut it for me. I think the main problem is that he didn't make us care for the characters involved and any movie that misses this part, I usually don't recommend. Miyazaki definitely winds an inventive story with unique animation and interesting demons and creatures as he usually does but the heart comes across missing. The story is about a group of humans who want to take the forest back from the animal gods who currently inhabit it and sometimes cause havoc with they turn into demons. This situation occurred early on and the prince of the story becomes infected to the point of having a curse on him that will eventually cause him to die. He's sent west to a forest area to hopefully get cured by the Deer God. He then meets up with Princess Mononoke, who is a half-human, half-wolf protector of the forest and tries to combine with her to help the cause, eventually. Battles ensue, and we do end up getting a happy ending – which we knew we'd see eventually, but two hours of the preparation for it was too much for me. I think the purpose of the story was to get us to see how we need to protect the forest, which I think we know, but the slow moving narrative ruins the purpose. So, a beautiful film again by the director but this one didn't hit home.",4,6,18,13 September 2009

The Wizard of Oz," Perfect fantasy entertainment...
","1st watched 6/10/2007 - 10 out of 10(Dir-Victor Fleming): Perfect fantasy entertainment with singable songs and danceable tunes fit for the whole family. Prior to this viewing, I'm sure I saw the movie on television when I was younger during one of those annual viewings, but this is the first time I've seen it in it's entirety since taking on the challenge of reviewing movies and I must say this is the first time in a long time that I'm having a hard time finding any fault in a movie. It is fun from beginning to end even to a 42-year old, with excellent portrayals of all the well-loved characters from the L. Frank Baum novel. The closest thing to an issue I had was the cowardly lion's 2nd song about being the king, but even it had it's merits. The version I watched was at a special Turner Classics movie presentation with added sing-a-long titles that just added to the fun for the audience allowing them to participate. We all know the story, but I'll recap it here. It's about a girl Dorothy from Kansas(played by the immortal Judy Garland) having struggles at home being noticed(in black & white), then a tornado comes, she goes into a fantasy world(in color) where a lot of her family is portrayed behind the Oz characters. She eventually learns that there is no place like home after struggling to get back there thru many trials & tribulations mainly coming from the evil witch of the west. This is the basic story, but it is told with such inventiveness with excellent set pieces, songs, costumes and storytelling that keeps you interested to the very end(which changes to black & white). After watching this, I now understand why this movie & it's stars have been immortalized in filmdom for all time.",10,7,9,10 June 2007
From Here to Eternity," Well told drama/romance military movie...
","1st watched 12/01/2001 - 8 out of 10 (Dir-Fred Zinnemann): Well told drama/romance military movie with a cast that played their roles out very well.  Lancaster as the tough Sergeant,  Montgomery Clift as the young man trying to hold onto his ideals despite strict Army treatment, Sinatra as his friend, with Donna Reed and  Deborah Kerr also playing characters that have stories(but their's aren't explored as much).  Not a real good picture of the Army, but still got the Academy Award for Best Picture and did well at the box office after World War II despite this.  I believe this was because of the story-telling and the high-level of acting involved around that story(based on a book by James Joyce).   Many familiar faces in supporting character roles are also aplenty in this film epic that should have it's place in the film-world eternity(DVD release??).",8,1,2,1 December 2001
V for Vendetta," Disturbing and complex story...
","1st watched 9/27/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir-James McTeigue): Disturbing and complex story about a terrorist/freedom fighter named V who plots to take down a falsifying government of the near future in jolly old England in a setting where the U.S. has tumbled under itself. England is ruled by a dictator similar to '1984''s Big Brother(who is played in a weird twist by John Hurt who was the victim in the latest movie version of the book). The character V was one of the subjects of the government's experiments with chemical weapons and was disfigured in a fire when they decided to shut it down but he survived and now wears a mask to cover the burns. He now has vengeance and justice in mind for those who caused the fire and for the government. Natalie Portman's character comes on the scene when she is used by him to get into the nationally controlled television station and make his own announcement. The announcement concerns him celebrating a late freedom's fighters attempt at blowing up parliamant and getting hanged for it on the anniversary of the event. It's amazing how complex this movie is considering it's based on a graphic novel where only the illustrator get's credit.(I'm sure the Wachowski bro's who wrote the screenplay added some things) Overall, the feeling of the movie is that we're supposed to think that violence is the only way to bring down this type of nation. This is truly a disturbing thought, although it might be true. It is an interesting story that brings much thought as to what matters most to your mind when it ends, but it's not that great of a movie. The Wachowski brothers still don't do much for me( I'm maybe one of the few that didn't like their Matrix movies), sorry -- but I have to say things the way I see them.",4,1,10,30 September 2009
Semi-Pro," Silly comedy about a fictitious ABA basketball team...
","1st watched 7/28/2011 – 3 out of 10(Dir-Kent Alterman): Silly comedy about a fictitious ABA basketball team out of Flint, Michigan and their quest to be merged into the NBA. This merger actually happened in real life back in the 70's but the ABA wasn't considered semi-pro but was equal to the NBA. The movie contains many un-truth's concerning this actual event(but for comedy's sake they get away with it). Will Ferrell, plays the owner, coach, announcer, player, promoter and motivator for the team that isn't doing well statistically or financially. They bring in a new point guard(whom they get in a trade for a washing machine for the Kentucky Colonels), played by Woody Harrelson, who is washed-up as far as a player, but knows the game and eventually takes over the coaching duties. There are funny bits in the movie but they are too few and far-between, and the movie ends up just playing out like a silly cliché-driven underdog sports movie that we've seen too many of. I personally wish they wouldn't have used the ABA because too many of us know the truth's about the league, which wasn't nearly as bad as the movie portrays it being. And please!! – Will Farrell starting on a professional basketball team?? He should have considered getting a little more in shape before taking on this role then maybe we would have believed him in the role a little more. But back to what the movie was supposed to be, a comedy – well, all-in-all the movie just wasn't that funny and therefore I definitely don't recommend it.",3,0,0,30 July 2011
