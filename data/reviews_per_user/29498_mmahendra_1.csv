Skyfall," Is this a 007 movie?????????
","WARNING - MAY CONTAIN REFERENCES THAT CAN SPOIL THE MOVIE EXPERIENCEAfter a huge disappointment 4 years ago I was eagerly waiting for the next Bond flick; I am sorry to say the latest installment is no great shakes. If I remove the 007 / James Bond tag... this is less than ordinary movie. In short, its been down hill for James Bond Franchise since Casino RoyalI was surprised to see a 8.3 Rating last week and went and watched the movie; Guys I respect IMDb review and reviewers who write it - but this was a total anti climax; I guess most of the reviews here are emotionally written and got carried awayI do love Bond movies and have been watching them for ages; I was bit disappointed when I heard they were running out of budget for future flicks. And then they announced SKYFALL - was really looking forward to watch it; looks like the franchise wanted to bring out something soon to ensure James Bond spirit alive, but not this way!!! you guys could have done a much better job I concur with some of the reviewers here, the plot is very weak - I must say pretty strait forward and recycled in many movies.Lot of loose ends - like the plot / detail of blowing up MI6 building, Javier's escape from most secured MI6 prison / captivity, how does Javier's computer hacks the MI6 and may more... I think lot of this was left to viewer imaginationAnd as someone said Home Alone ending... I bet most of you agree at least Home Alone had a better ending plotAnother disappointment - James bond is know for gadget, women and some tough villains - all three were missing in this movie except - a potato gun and a transmitter that did not even see daylight for more than 10 seconds in the entire movieI wish next James Bond Flick comes with more substance....Wishing for a bright future for James Bond FranchiseSadly signing off.....",3,22,45,10 November 2012
