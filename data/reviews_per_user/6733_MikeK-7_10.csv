The Devil's Advocate," Vanity, definitely my favorite sin!
","I loved the movie. Everything from its claustrophobic atmosphere, to lovely Charlize Theron's role as Keenau's disturbed wife. I don't think I've see Al Pacino in a role this good since Scarface. He plays a real bastard, and he knows everything. If you have a weak stomach or are strong in your religion, don't see this movie, you'll have nightmares.",10,1,1,27 June 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Sadly, somewhat disappointing
","I was very anxious to see this movie. It had been a long time since I had a good scare. 'Scary as hell' the poster read. So finally in November, I bought a copy. Well, it's not all its cracked up to be. 90% of the film is boring talk that nobody really cares about, the characters are uninteresting and hateful, and some of the lines sound like they weren't really putting up any effort. I've heard from many people that this film was ripped off by Ruggero Deodato's 1979 film CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Although I haven't seen that film, I'm guessing this could be true. I will give THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT credit, however, for the last ten minutes, which are terrifying, but I won't spoil it for those who (unlikely) haven't seen it.",5,0,1,15 December 1999
Fight Club," You are not a beautiful, or unique snowflake!
","Clever doesn't begin to describe how ingenious this film is.  The saddest thing is that most people who haven't seen it, but have just heard about it, are going to misinterpret it as just another brainless 'man' movie. But it's much more complex than that.  If you haven't seen it (you'd have to be from Outer Space), see it, and if you've seen it, SEE IT AGAIN!  I have spoken.",10,0,1,4 December 2000
The Beach," Just gorgeous!
","The movie looks beautiful!  Shot in Thailand, featuring the best looking locations I've ever seen.  Virginie Leyoden's first American film and she looks great, plot wise, however, the movie falls a bit short.  Made by Danny 'TRAINSPOTTING' Boyle, it features the same kind of cinematography which I cannot explain but those who have seen both know what I mean.  Leo does an alright job, nothing spectacular.  If you love tropical locations (and who doesn't!) see this movie at once.",8,0,0,23 March 2000
American Pie," Great Movie
","I heard this movie was really great, so I saw it and was glad I did.  It's not as 'shocking' nor as 'repulsive' as I heard from many.  I think this movie accurately portrays a teenager's struggling life and the situations that occur.  All of the characters in this movie are funny, and likeable. The pie scene wasn't too explicit, but the implications were there.  The DVD contains tons of extra so if you like this movie I'd highly recommend it. However, subject matter in this movie isn't exceptable for young kids, but I think 14 and 15 year olds can handle it.",8,1,2,29 December 1999
American Psycho," Sus-sus-sudio
","The film was a flat out riot!  Never has the 80's been portrayed in such a nihilistic fashion.  The satire is almost too extreme at times, but those who have a true taste for cinema will be able to appreciate this film.  It's understandable if a lot of people hate it, because the protagonist is so dispecable. I'm gonna make sure that I read the book.",10,3,6,4 December 2000
American History X," Grab your handkerchiefs
","I think about this movie everyday, it is so sad that it will have you thinking about it days after you've seen. Very realistic, and powerfully moving. The ending shocked me like an electric chair. I'm trembling as I'm writing this, and I don't think I've ever seen a better movie. The Academy really screwed Edward Norton over, he deserved the best actor award more than anybody. The best movie of recent years. The second I buy a DVD player I'm going to get this and see the director's cut.",10,0,0,23 June 1999
Once Upon a Time in America," Long, but not overlong
","The running time would make most people say they don't want to see it, but don't let that stop you. Robert De Niro and James Woods give their greatest performances, and Ennio Morricone's music is fabulous. I would not recommend the 4-hour version for mainstream movie-goers. Start off with the short version (which is still about 2 and a half hours), then save a day for the long version.",10,3,6,26 September 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Madness....I like it
","The movie is a gem, and it has real genuine terror. The movie's protagonist Alex isn't supernatural, he's a human monster. From attacking people to rape to home invasion to prison, Alex does what he wants, when he wants. When released in 1971 most people considered it too strong for most stomachs, too ahead for it's time. The background pieces are wonderful and the cinematography is lovely. Every year on Halloween I dress up as Alex even with the eye lash. Definitely Stanley Kubrick's best movie.R.I.P. Mr. Kubrick.",10,0,0,17 June 1999
Trainspotting," 'Lust for Life...da da da...'
","The most fascinating movie of the year. This movie is definetly is not for mainstream moviegoers. I really love this movie, from its Scottish slang, to its crazy antics, everyone in here is in top form. Ewan McGregor is great but Robert Carlyle is even better as the psychotic, and totally unpredictable Begbie. I can't hardly wait, in one week I'll have the rare green box version, with the director's cut...... CHOOSE LIFE, CHOOSE THIS MOVIE !",10,1,2,5 September 1999
