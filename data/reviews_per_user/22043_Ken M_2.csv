The Ring," Surprisingly good
","The Ring surprised me. I have to admit, I didn't expect much. My son rented the movie from Netflix, and before I sent it back I thought I would check out a few minutes. I was expecting a teen slasher movie. However, I was quickly hooked by its stylish imagery and interesting characters. Some of the scenes were very David Lynch. I like a story where the characters behave (more or less) believably in unbelievable circumstances, and I think they did a pretty good job in that regard. The pacing of the movie is very good. I never felt the story was dragging or jumping to far ahead. Extras were minimal on the DVD. I would have like a directors commentary, or 'making of' segment. Maybe there is a second disk I didn't have???",8,1,1,28 March 2003
Memento," Brilliant & original
","Just when I thought everything had been done in film, Memento proves there can still be original ideas. It has a brilliant plot device, an outstanding script, and terrific acting. I loved  it from beginning to end. Or is that from end to beginning?By the way, the memory condition Leonard has is indeed very real. Over time these sad people do come to know what their plight is, and some things can be absorbed into memory. But they say it just like you woke up in a strange place, not knowing where you are, every moment of your life.",Null,0,1,13 May 2001
