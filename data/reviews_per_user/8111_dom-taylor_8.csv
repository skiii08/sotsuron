Catch Me If You Can," Not a typical spielberg movie, but enjoyable (Spoilers)
","I enjoyed watching this movie, despite it features one of my least favourite actors, Leoanrdo Di Caprio. Tom Hanks gives a good peformance, although, compared to his performance in 'Saving private Ryan', it sucked.The movie has an excellent twist, as we see how the main character 'Frank Abagnale' cons thousands of people, when he relentlessly continues to pay for expensive purchases, when the amount cannot be obtained from his account.   Although I thought the film in general was fairly good, it didn't seem to be a movie made by Spielberg. To me, Spielberg seems to create superb master pieces again and again, for example; Schindler's list, and saving private ryan; and, this film seemed to be directed by a more novice director.Having said that, the characters, acting and dialogue are very good, and the movie concludes with a big thums up!",7,0,1,15 June 2004
American History X," An excellent, and visual portrayal of consequences of racism.
","The movie, of which is probably Ed Norton's best is extremely harrowing, and moving, with a lot of very harsh dialogue. Although enhances an excellent story, plus to add to it, a film in which has only very occasionally been done before, director Tony Kaye has created a master piece, which sets an extremely good example of what may happen to racist people. Having said that, the black and white scenes are unnecessary. Spielberg created 'Schindler's list' in black and white in 1993, and this worked beautifully, setting the field of a dark chapter in human history. This film is completely different, and should always be in colour, sticking with Norton's different hair styles to embark in different sessions in the character's life!Overall rating: 8.5/10",8,0,0,27 May 2004
Die Hard 2," Along with Die Hard 1: the two best action films I've ever seen
","The twist between the characters, story line, and especially the constant action made Die hard 2 a superb achievement in 1900. Now, enter 2004, where we have the pleasure of experiencing Dolby 5.1, which, when coming to movies like this will baffle your ears, resulting in the movie been 10 times better when introducing smashing windows, harsh dialogue, passing aeroplanes and sudden explosions. This movie, although probably isn't suitable for young children, will provide most audiences with a very entertaining couple of hours. Giving the fact the director is different for this installment of the Die Hard trilogy, Renny Harlin has provided the audience with a gripping couple of hours, continuing the Die Hard genre in much the same way as director John McTiernan. Personal ratings: 9.5/10",7,1,3,26 May 2004
Saving Private Ryan," A very accurate war epic, with a inaccurate storyline
","Saving Private Ryan is a superb war epic that will probably be remembered in the far future, revising the Second World War very accurately. It begins with the title character, James Ryan as an old man surrounded by his family; whereby are visiting the grave of a very important person in Ryan's life. The film then very quickly takes a new approach, as we begin to learn the story of the beginning of the film, and just who this person is.Moving onto the famous D-day landing; an event that very few war films have portrayed, especially in such graphic detail, then moves beyond the beach, and through wrecked towns and cities in France. The film then progresses as the title of the film is explained, and new characters are introduced and lost, demonstrating the real horror of war.The film in general is about a solider, who has been unlucky enough to lose three of his brothers in combat, leading to a special, dangerous mission. Captain John Miller, (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan, an American solider situated somewhere in France. The men question their orders, but continue to embark on the mission. As Ryan, becomes nearer, the mission becomes harder, and soon, most of the characters are suddenly killed, including Captain Miller, the name on the grave at the opening sequence of the film!Although very well acted, and involving a gripping story line, it is fair to say the story should be more realistic as this story is extremely unlikely to happen in the real World War 2.",9,1,2,18 May 2004
Schindler's List," An eye opener (Spoilers)
","'Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire', Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley)A film, one of Spielberg's best which details some of the horrific, and in human consequences of WW2 has been one of the best rated, and talked about movies about the holocaust in recent history. Schindler's list, presented in a black and white format enhances the visual wounds, and emotional feelings of this dark chapter in human history, without actually being involved in this era of time.   We begin the film by meeting Schindler, an excellent performance by Liam Neeson, of which we see he is a successful, generous business man. As the film unfolds, we see him changing as a person as the thousands of people are forced out of their homes, separated and sent to the camps, continued by mass killings, torture and larbour. The film also illustrates in detail the other horrors endured by the Jews, plus Schindler's friendship to Itzhak Stern, and eventually concluding by his speech, in which he announces the war is over, followed by Schindler breaking down after the years of murder he has just witnessed.The film as a whole then ends, returning to colour, making Spielberg successfully creating a field of depression in the 1940's, seperated against today's world: a more human place to live! It is here where Schindler is remembered, and the results of what he did are shown as how it matters today!Personal rating: 9/10",8,9,13,2 June 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Superb acting, superb story, the whole thing's superb!
","It has to be said, this is something different. Kate Winslet continues her usual acting techniques, which it seems in every film she has made, she has created a different character each time. (For example, from quills to titanic). Winslet's character would certainly not be the same character if director Michel Gondry had chosen a different actressBut, what amazes me most is the role projected by Jim Carrey. Most people will agree he has created a reputation of being a comedian; whether you find him funny or not, this is the genre of the film he usually works in....but here comes this movie, and my response is wow!It seems Winslet and carrey switch their usual roles, Winslet Portraying an out going, slightly odd but cool character, and Carrey a quiet, sensible person, who from time to time may become emotional.I was also interested in the choice of the theme of the film, its highly unusual, and has never been done before. It's not another installment of the Harry Potter or LOTR collection, or even based on a novel; its a brand new idea, very entertaining with many twists and turns in the plot which kept me extremely interested.Excellent job!7.5/10",7,0,1,18 October 2004
The Deer Hunter," Underrated
","An extremely powerful, and sensational epic, with a very emotional story, 'The Deer Hunter' was nominated for no less than 5 Oscars in 1978, including best actor, best director and best sound.The film begins by focusing on the daily lives of the main characters, most of which are very close friends, working in Pennsylvania as steelworkers. As the story unfolds, we see the film isn't about 'deer hunting' at all, but about the tragic consequences of the Vietnam War. Three of the main characters, Michael, Steven and Nick become captured by the Vietcong, and are forced to play Russian roulette, where bets are made on their survival. Eventually, most manage to make a close and gripping escape, but are suffering from terrible, emotional and physical stress. Michael later returns to Saigon to fulfill an old vow to one of his friends who was forced to stay behind, making a horrific discovery. It's a situation where Michael will either return home with his friend, or return home alone!The film, although extremely harrowing, will stay with you long after the film has finished, and is a genuine achievement in film making history!!Well done to the director!!!",8,0,0,18 May 2004
Apollo 13," Good movie
","First off Â– I have to confess I am an avowed space junkie and this tends to raise the bar in terms of my expectations of this movie, being familiar with the true life events that form the background of this movie. 	 In summary, the movie surrounds the near-disaster which surrounded NASA's Ill-fated 3rd  Mission to the moon. After two landings on the moon the missions had become almost commonplace and public interest in the space program was beginning to wane. This changed at 03:06 UT on 14 April 1970 when a malfunction in a heating coil caused an oxygen tank to explode, severely damaging the service module. The damage was so extensive that it forced the abandonment of the moon-landing and the severely compromised the ability of Astronauts Cpt James Lovell, John L Swigert and Fred Haise jnr to return home, a task they were able to accomplish only by jury-rigging their available equipment under the direction of Houston and suffering cold temperatures before they were able to successfully renter the Earths atmosphere in their spacecraft.Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon are eerily convincing as the astronauts and excellently manage to convey the tension of being in mortal danger in a malfunctioning tin can a quarter of a million miles from home, facing not only the bitter disappointment at not completing the mission of landing on the moon but the prospect of losing their lives in such an inhospitable and lonely environment. Of course nobody except the original astronauts knows what was going through their minds but Hanks et al allow the audience to appreciate the state of disciplined tension and terror that the voyagers were subjected to.Other performances worthy of note include a determined and gritty portrayal of Charismatic and forceful Nasa Flight Director Gene Kranz by Ed Harris.The film is well directed and the pace does not lack, despite the difficulty of portraying events in a tense fashion in a space not much larger than a large caravan, and the long periods of inactivity that form a large part of manned space flight.Summary : An excellent `true life' movie, successful  in portraying events both in space and the reaction of those left on the ground.Rating : 90%",7,1,2,19 July 2004
