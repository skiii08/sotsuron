The Incredible Hulk," Pretty Good For A Film About A Green Bloke Who Breaks Stuff.
","After seeing part of the original disasterpiece churned out by Marvel in 2003 I was quite pessimistic towards the new 'Incredible Hulk' movie. Yet again cinema screens would be going green as the new CGI superhero flexes his biceps for an hour, like some kind of perverse exercise tape. My opinion was swiftly changed however when I noticed that the cast included Edward Norton...and much to my surprise he had been cast as the weedier alter ego of The Hulk, Dr Bruce Banner. In my opinion Edward Norton has yet to star in a bad movie and contrary to my initial thoughts toward the new comic book flick, he maintains his ability to turn a potentially disastrous screenplay, into solid gold. Unlike the first attempt Marvel made at trying to bring the no brained, green lump to the big screen, this second try has clearly been thought through. The storyline was sharp and kept me interested past the first half hour, a feat many recent films have failed to do. The casting was excellent and Norton in particular steals the show as the disturbed scientist battling with himself to contain his hideous secret. The action scenes throughout were quite inventive, but used bits of car whenever possible, which quickly got old. I mean there's a limit to the ways a big green man can break more stuff with already broken stuff. The special effects as per se with comic book to film adaptations were brilliant and really brought the Hulk to life. The most amazing part in my mind however was the film's ability to make me like a character I've always hated as a child. I was never a fan of Bruce Banner and his large handed alter ego, but after seeing this newest addition to the marvel library I must say I have a new level of respect for the big guy.Unfortunately it isn't all good. As I said before, the action scenes basically involve a big green bloke throwing all manner of vehicles at more vehicles to make big explosions. The action isn't particularly stylish but then again...when did the Hulk ever go for ballet composure? Other then that small rant..I actually can't think of anything else to strike this film down with. I mean of course there are better action films, and better comic book films (Iron Man for example). But hell, there are far worse things you could spend an hour and a half on. Like blending your face for example.If your going to see this film purely for action purposes and pretty explosions then Im sure you will be satisfied. For the people like me however, who can't be seduced by flames and twisted metal, there is still light at the end of the tunnel. The acting is brilliant, the cast shine throughout and the storyline is well planned and interesting. The subtle use of humour in places also adds that crucial touch of variety that many action capers of late were crying out for.Overall a decent action film that won't cause mass uproar with the Marvel fanboys, as it sticks closely to its comic book origins. If you are looking for a film to go see and can't quite decide, check this one out. I did and I wasn't disappointed (for a change!).",7,3,5,16 June 2008
Silent Hill," Confusing, Linear and Titanically disastrous.
","Silent hill has been giving gaming fans sleepless nights since its 90's debut on playstation. The film adaptation however induced sleep as its steep crawl into some form of horror simply took a golden age. By the time anyone in the cinema knew what was going on, a man with a piece of toblerone attached to his cranium was pursuing the under developed characters of this dingy motel of horror film around a rust infested CGI set. This film can only be described as a very bad roller-coaster. It hurtles viewers from one enigma to another without explaining any key events whatsoever. As I have played the games, I had some answers to the questions my bewildered friends were asking, such as 'who the hell is he?', 'Why are they even here?' and the classic 'why has everything turned rusty?'. Unfortunately for anyone still in the dark as to the storyline of the games franchise, this rubik's cube of a film will cause you to develop narcolepsy for its entire running time, as trying to keep up with the endless hail of plot twists is overly tiring. Even the legendary Sherlock Holmes would be scratching his cap wearing head as to the whereabouts of the runaway plot line.Some of the finer features of the film include, rape with barbed wire, The fiery torture of a female police officer and of course a deformed and very undead paedophile janitor named Colin. Sounds interesting I know, but trust me. It isn't.The ending of this film should have been a masterpiece, a true Da Vinci of the horror genre. Instead, it is a cheap caricature of what could of been a amazing and truly frightening game to film adaptation. The storyline was already prepared like a fine cuisine. Instead the directors chose a cheap half baked finger buffet and destroyed any hope of dignity this film had left.The events that took place were summed up perfectly by one utterly baffled viewer in my screen, who at a blank and silent transition between scenes, expressed his outrage at the mystery narrative with a quite accurate 'What the F***!?'. This outburst however voiced what everyone was thinking and marked the steep decline of Silent Hill.An utterly disgusting display of film making that should not be viewed without some aspirin and an ice pack for the headache that will develop from trying to find some clue as to the storyline. Not recommended to anyone, ESPECIALLY fans of the game.",4,1,2,9 May 2008
Predator," I Ain't Got Time To Bleed!
","Arnie once again dons his self destructing shirt and large weapon for a brief spot of jungle warfare. After Dutch (Arnie) and his team are sent on a rescue mission, joined by Dillon (Carl Weathers) things get a bit hairy. As usual Arnie has been lead into a scrupulous situation filled with Rebels armed to the teeth with all manner of explosives and ballistics and some nice skinless corpses to decorate the trees, like Christmas baubles. Fortunately, Arnie (as usual) is prepared and flexes his biceps while firing more one liners than bullets. The film then takes a sci fi twist, and the team of elite soldiers are pitted against an alien warrior who finds hunting muscular strong men a form of sport.The balance of tension plus all guns blazing action work really well, and the use of some decent (yet a bit dated) special effects top off the experience. Although Predator isn't exactly artistic, it delivers its narrative effectively nevertheless. You certainly get all the bang you could want for your buck here, as usual with an Arnie film.The rest of the cast were also really enjoyable to watch and the subtle blend of humour and at times drama came across brilliantly. The characters weren't over developed nor were they linear and pointless. Each character had a role, unlike most action films in which the supporting cast are cast aside like a used tissue after a certain cinematic event.Overall, Predator kept me interested for its running time and unlike most modern action farces, didn't trail off in the last half hour, reducing me to a tearful and bored wreck. The soundtrack worked well with the events and the setting was well planned and coincided beautifully with the narrative.Action and Arnie fans should enjoy, yet if your after a more serious sci-fi horror/action try Alien/s",7,1,2,18 July 2008
Hancock," Good Comedy, Bad Drama.
","Hancock Is the story of a particularly useless superhero, who while hated by the general public, manages to befriend a floundering PR agent. This may sound drab, but to my surprise it was actually good fun and induced a few chuckles along the way. Hancock then gets slightly too close to his only friends wife, and things get....strange to say the least.After a good run, Hancock then gives up its comedy elements, and turns into some kind of melodrama. This then unfunny comedy drags on for the final half hour until its perplexing end that then concludes the rotting narrative concocted by its director.The gags in the first half of the film are priceless and had me writhing blissfully in my cinema chair. The clever jokes then turn into Farcicle crash bang wallop sequences, probably thrown in to amuse the ice cream clad screaming children, armed with snot and tears dragged into the screen by their parents.Will Smith as usual is brilliant and continues to shine with his humour. Charlize Theron looks stunning and her acting isn't that bad. The rest of the cast are forgettable unfortunately and didn't stand out or increase the narrative in any way.This film would have scored more highly if it had stuck to its guns and stayed with comedy, rather then trying to craftily swap genre and standing out like an amateur transvestite at a beauty pageant.Still worth a viewing, but prepare for bitter disappointment as this floundering comedrama simply runs out of funny juice after 45 minutes.",6,1,2,18 July 2008
Shooter," A High Octane Thrill Ride With Plot Twist's That Will Make You Sick With Glee
","The Shooter experience began for me, as a drab Sunday afternoon visit to my local cinema, with nothing in mind for viewing and a disappointing lineup on all screens. One of my compadre's noticed an action film called Shooter on the board and since none of us had heard anything about it, we decided to go and check it out. As with most films I see, my thoughts towards the mystery action film were pessimistic. Five minutes in however and I was spellbound. From the moment Mark Wahlberg began his sniping kill-fest on top of an Ethiopian hill, I was hooked.The violence was extra gratifying, as watching sniper bullets scramble the brains of mortar chugging rebels was right up my street. After enticing me in with this taster sample, Shooter then threw me hard into the main storyline. So far this out of no-where film was taking my breath away and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what was around the next corner. The story basically consists of a counter operation of a presidential assassination.As you may find however things in this movie are never straight forward, and the whole operation lands our hero Bob Lee Swagger into a big heap of dung. After being framed for the attempt on the presidents life and forced to go into hiding, the plot begins to expose itself more clearly and has more twists than spaghetti junction.The later action scenes are done beautifully, and the mix of Bullets, pipe bombs and napalm had me drooling with pleasure.Wahlberg and Glover both deliver solid and believable roles and bring the screenplay to life. Wahlberg Was a delight to watch and made his character Bob Lee Swagger more then just an average action protagonist.Although this film came from no-where and then departed just as quickly it really left an impression on me, and I recommend anyone who likes the combination of adrenaline fuelled action and a brilliant storyline from a genius director to grab a copy asap!One of the best action films I personally have seen. I really do suggest action fans to check this movie out.",10,1,5,17 June 2008
Iron Man," The Best Marvel Screen Adaptation To Date
","Ironman was always one of my favourite Marvel characters. Alongside Spidey and Wolverine, Tony Stark and his snazzy titanium Deathsuit ranked highly in my list of superheroes. Thats why I was initially aprehensive of Marvels latest big screen venture. I was excited to see what Ironman would look like in full CGI and whether Marvel would hit the nail on the head with storyline. At the same time however, I was terrified that they were going to slay a classic character like their previous Hulk incarnation had.After a bit of further research, I decided the Cast looked solid enough and the trailers looked impressive and so my mind was eased slightly. I waited anxiously for the day I would be able to feast my eyes on the shiny new comic book caper and kept my fingers crossed that Marvel wouldn't balls it up.I can safely say they did a stunning job of bringing Ironman to the big screen.Robert Downey Jr. played the role of slick playboy Tony Stark flawlessly. From start to finish his perfect portrayal of the woman eating studmuffin kept me captivated and his sleazy one liners kept me chuckling like a besotted school Girl. His On-screen connection with the lovely Miss Paltrow was electrifying, and made for a believable and quirky relationship. The supporting cast were all superb, and Colonel James 'War Machine' Rhodes, was also cast brilliantly.The storyline was as close to the comics as it could have been, and kept me on my toes throughout. It was well constructed, well planned and had an excellent screenplay to boot.The Visuals were none less then breathtaking and the action scenes were high octane and adrenaline injected. A beautifully made concoction that Marvel should utilise more often.This is by far the best recent Comic Book to Movie adaptation since Batman Begins, Lets just hope Marvel keep this winning formula for any further big screen escapades they splash out on.Ironman is one of the few films I cannot pick a fault with. This was 126 minutes of sheer entertainment and I recommend all filmgoers to go and check it out as soon as you can.",10,3,6,17 June 2008
Evil Dead II," Sheer Brilliance
","Evil Dead 2 was by far the best horror b-movie I have ever seen. Its cheap effects and terrible acting only serve to emphasize the humour and irony depicted by director Sam Raimi. Not only does Evil Dead 2 completely retcon everything that happened in its entirely serious predecessor, it does it on a very low budget, which always leaves room for laughs. I may seem to be picking on this great movie, But I assure you every moment was enjoyed. From the second the legendary 'Ash' cuts off his own possessed hand with a petrol chainsaw, I knew this film was destined for great things. Several buckets of fake blood and plenty of latex later I was not disappointed. Ranging from flying eyeballs, blood spewing walls, dancing corpses and of course a good old spattering of tree rape, Evil dead 2 completely re-writes the conventions of the classic B-movie. With its obvious tongue in cheek style and purposely bad narrative, this funny, action packed horror romp really did brighten my day. From start to finish you will be laughing and cringing at this masterpiece of film, and will want to watch it again and again.This beautifully made horror parody to this day remains a cult classic, so I recommend anyone reading this to go and invest in what I can only describe as sheer brilliance.",10,3,3,10 May 2008
