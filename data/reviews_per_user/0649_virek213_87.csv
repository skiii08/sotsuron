The Blair Witch Project," Horror And/Or Hype?
","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is one of those films that made history by shooting to the top of the box office while being made on a very paltry budget of just $40,000.  It also benefitted from all the hype surrounding its story of a group of teens who venture into the desolate Maryland woods to find out if the legend of the Blair Witch is fact or fiction.  As a result, this film went on to gross $130 million during the late summer of 1999.But while the premise of the story and the inventive 'Shaky-Cam' work of the filmmakers suggest a very chilling and suspenseful film, I am only able to give this film a '6' rating out of 10.The reason?  Even for $40,000, you think it would be easier for filmmakers Eduardo Myrick and Daniel Sanchez to come up with a better use of dialogue than you'd get in an average teen-slasher pic.  The pacing of the film is unquestionably inventive, and the atmosphere, the further the teens venture into the woods, begins to resemble John Boorman's 1972 classic DELIVERANCE. The stick figures used as the signs of the Blair Witch's presence (the witch herself, in a thoroughly brilliant move, is never, ever seen) are also good; and the lack of explicit gore is quite refreshing.  But the dialogue is so profanity-ridden that it gets tired after a while.  It is worse than any of the screaming done by the film's lead heroine (Heather Donahue) or her 'I'm-so-scared'-by flashlight scene.Unlike a lot of people, I wouldn't call THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT an overhyped low-budget disaster; in terms of premise, it more than lives up to the hype. Even the acting of this amateur group is worth sitting through.  But unlike others, because of the dialogue (the one and ONLY reason this film has its 'R' rating at all), I can't quite call it a masterpiece.  Still, it is a worthy film, if frustratingly uneven.",6,0,1,13 May 2003
Saturday Night Fever," Still Stayin' Alive, More Than 40 Years Later
","Where to begin??Is it the polyester suits? Is it the disco mirror balls? Is it the Bee Gees? Is it the charisma of John Travolta?Well, the answer to all four of these questions is YES.More than four decades since it was unleashed onto a not-entirely-unsuspecting world at the end of 1977, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER remains one of the cultural touchstone movies of the late 1970s, admittedly dated in some places (sometimes a bit too painfully obvious), but timeless in far more ways than one. Its story of Travolta's working-class New York City tough Tony Manero getting onto the dance floor at the 2001 Odyssey club and showing his stuff to escape his oppressive family life, but seemingly unable to commit to either one of the two women (Donna Pescow; Karen Lynn Gorney) that he finds there, is a true microcosm, not only of the era in general but also of the much-reviled Disco craze in particular. Nik Cohn's story 'Tribal Rites Of The New Saturday Night' provided a whole lot for screenwriter Norman Wexler to conjure up, and he had a lot of help from Travolta, who had first become a star on TV via the 1976 TV film THE BOY IN THE PLASTIC BUBBLE and the hit TV sitcom 'Welcome Back Kotter', then on the big screen as Nancy Allen's toady boyfriend in Brian DePalma's 1976 horror classic CARRIE. He is also helped by the sure-footed (to use a well-turned phrase) direction of John Badham, who had had many credits for television but, prior to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, only one big screen credit (1976's THE BINGO LONG TRAVELLING ALL-STARS & MOTOR KINGS). Besides all the great dance sequences, there is also the famous scene of Travolta and his friends playing a dangerous game of chicken on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge while a horrified Pescow looks on, set to 'Night On Disco Mountain', a discofied adaptation, by David Shire, of Modest Mussorgsky's terrifying 1867 symphonic tone poem 'A Night On Bald Mountain'.Made for what nowadays seems like a ridiculously low budget of only $3 million, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was not only a huge box office hit, grossing something like close to a quarter of a billion dollars, but also unleashed a 2-LP soundtrack album that went on to spend twenty-six straight weeks atop Billboard's album chart and sell close to 40 million copies, making it one of the most successful album releases ever. That the film should have been as successful as it was is kind of amazing even now, considering how rough the street language in it was, making it unsuitable for unaccompanied minors and thus warranting the 'R' rating that it got. Even so, it's hard to forget the impact it had on popular culture, with a wall-to-wall soundtrack that included not only the Bee Gees, but Yvonne Elliman, MFSB, Ralph MacDonald, Tavares, KC and the Sunshine Band, and many more-a soundtrack that still keeps selling like crazy even to this day.It is instructive to look back at this film, and realize that the craze it depicted was the subject of a lot of invective from the so-called 'Disco Sucks!!' crowd, a bunch of disaffected rock and roll fans of the time who railed against Disco as a 'threat' to their music, which, being a classic rock fan myself, I always found overblown. Rock music wasn't consumed by either the Disco craze or by this film and its soundtrack, far from it. Given that, and everything contained in it, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER remains a truly classic film, worthy of many viewings.",10,0,1,28 May 2019
First Man," Somewhat Cold And Detached, But More-Than-Worthy Look At Neil Armstrong
","On July 20, 1969, the history of the human race changed forever when Neil Armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the Moon, making 'one small step for man...one giant leap for Mankind'. What not too many people outside of the American space program may have known about, however, was the psychological strain that Armstrong's astronaut training and his ascension into immortality has on him and his family. This was detailed in the best-selling 2005 biography 'First Man' by James Hansen, which received that year's American Astronautical Society's prize for Astronautical literature. And in 2018, that book was turned into an incredible historical drama on the same name.The film follows Armstrong, portrayed by Ryan Gosling (who had starred in the Oscar-winning 2016 film LA LA LAND), during his first years as part of NASA's astronaut corps, as America races not only to catch up with the dreaded Soviet Union in putting human beings into space (after the humiliations of seeing the Soviets beat them with a pair of Sputnik satellites and Yuri Gagarin) but also to meet President John F. Kennedy's stated goal of launching a man to the Moon and bringing him safely back to the Earth before the end of the 1960s. The race to the Moon means he has to be quite psychologically detached from almost all considerations, including what would otherwise pass for a 'normal' relationship with his wife (Claire Foy), and still have it in the back of his mind that his chosen line of work puts him and others in NASA's manned space lineup in extreme danger during these missions. This is borne out when his flight on Gemini 8 in the spring of 1966 goes almost fatally awry, followed by the loss of his three fellow astronauts Gus Grissom (Shea Whigham), Roger Chaffee (Cory Michael Smith) and Ed White (Jason Clarke) in the horrible Apollo 1 flash fire on the launch pad on January 27, 1967. And then there is, of course, the media asking questions whether such risks are worth expending billions of dollars on (even as billions more are at the same time being spent in Vietnam on a war that is increasingly splitting the country apart). And in the final days before Gosling makes that trip to Kennedy Space Center to embark on Apollo 11, he has a confrontation with Foy about the possibility that he won't be coming back. The family strain is exceptionally palpable by this time. Nevertheless, the mission happens; and the rest, as they say, is history.While the Apollo 11 flight is likely the most examined case of human technological might in history, FIRST MAN, due to the combination of director Damien Chazelle (who directed LA LA LAND and WHIPLASH) and screenwriter Josh Singer (who co-wrote the screenplays for SPOTLIGHT and THE POST), makes for a hugely interesting film. What is strikingly unusual about the film is the fact that much of what is done is played out in a low-key and arguably cold, detached way. Such an approach, in an age where overemphatic acting and hyperbolic action scenes remain the rage in Hollywood, was one thing that seemed to turn off many viewers to this movie, even though it worked quite well for director Stanley Kubrick and his 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which FIRST MAN pays homage to. But anyone who read Hansen's book will know that such detached behavior among the astronaut corps was part-and-parcel for that time. Like Kubrick, Chazelle also knows a thing or two about how to make real the incredible silence one finds in space. And while some 'uber-patriots' severely slammed FIRST MAN for never showing the U.S. flag being planted by Armstrong and Aldrin on the Moon, the truth of the matter was that the Apollo 11 mission wasn't just strictly an American endeavor, but the ultimate Human endeavor as well.Justin Hurwitz, who provided the Oscar-winning score for LA LA LAND, provides another great music score (with the occasional '2001' references); and FIRST MAN rightly won an Oscar for its realistic special effects work. Gosling's portrayal of Armstrong is also spot-on, regardless of how detached one might say he is, as are Foy, Kyle Chandler, and Ciaran Hinds. And even if the approach it takes might turn off those who want a lot more of heat, sound, and fury, FIRST MAN should rank up there with films like APOLLO 13 and THE RIGHT STUFF in terms of depicting not only America but all of humanity itself at its absolute best.",10,0,1,2 May 2019
Scarface," Don't get high on your own supply
","Ostensibly a reworking of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic, director Brian DePalma's 1983 crime epic SCARFACE remains one of the most hotly debated movies of modern times.  Although I myself cannot quite call this a masterpiece along the lines of, say, the GODFATHER films, I do think it captures the life of a criminal as well as any film has ever done.Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay to SCARFACE, so it not surprisingly also has a political slant to it.  The film opens with the 1980 Mariel boat lift, in which Castro allowed as many as 125,000 Cubans to join their families in the United States, free from his totalitarian regime.  The complication is that twenty percent of those who fled to America were known criminals.  One of the latter is Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban punk who gets in on the ground floor of an increasingly lucrative trade in Miami's Cuban community; the buying and distribution of cocaine.  He works his way up the ladder of the American dream because of the advice given to him by his mentor (Robert Loggia): never underestimate the other guy's greed, and don't get high on your own supply.But even as he makes connections with the Colombian drug kingpins who supply him with what he needs, Pacino also becomes increasingly power-crazy, addicted to his own supply (against Loggia's advice), and paranoid.  He alienates himself from virtually everyone around him, including his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) and sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  In the end, he steps onto the toes of the wrong drug lord (Paul Shenar), who sends assassins to Pacino's Miami villa, resulting in a ferocious and hugely violent, blood-drenched showdown.To this day, SCARFACE remains a touchstone movie for a lot of very good reasons.  It is a withering critique not only on the excesses of greed, money, crime, and corruption, but also on our own anti-Communist paranoia which gave Castro carte-blanche to export his worst scum to our shores and thus accelerate the amount crime and death associated with the drug problem. The way the South Florida drug underworld lifestyle is depicted by both DePalma and Stone is very true to the essentials.  And although I personally found Pacino's Cuban accent to be overdone at times, his performance (four-letter words and all) was and still IS the center of this film.But SCARFACE is not necessarily the easiest film to like.  At two hours and fifty minutes, even with an interesting political undercurrent, it does seem longer than is really necessary.  The amount of times the 'F' word is used (or variations of it) is perhaps a bit grossly overdone (I lost count of the number at around two hundred), although this too is perhaps close to the truth of its story.  Finally, SCARFACE is still one of the most violent films ever to have come out of Hollywood.  The chainsaw scene in the Miami apartment, the hanging from the chopper, and the ultra-gory shootout rank among the most violent sequences ever filmed.  I can recall of only four films that have this kind of nerve-shattering violence: THE WILD BUNCH, SOLDIER BLUE, TAXI DRIVER, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Still, Pacino's performance and a fairly good, albeit slightly cheesy, music score by Giorgio Moroder are worth giving SCARFACE a '7' rating.  But this is definitely NOT a film for young kids; it is rated 'R' for some very good reasons.",7,1,2,7 January 2002
Frost_Nixon," Battle Of Two Giants In The Political Media Arena
","It may not have seemed too much like it back in the spring of 1977, but the lengthy interview between British talk show host David Frost and former president Richard Nixon from Nixon's San Clemente home base is now considered one of the defining moments where politics and the media came together for compelling and dramatic results. Peter Morgan capitalized on the event in his play 'Frost/Nixon'; and now, that play, expanded into a feature-length film by Morgan himself, has succeeded well on the big screen as well, under the aegis of director Ron Howard (BACKDRAFT; APOLLO 13).Michael Sheen and Frank Langella recreate the roles they created onstage (which was done at Howard's insistence) as, respectively, the erudite British talk show host and the brooding ex-president. What could have been a talking-heads kind of show is instead turned into a riveting and, on more than one occasion, somewhat satirical look at the shallowness of the media. That last aspect is quite brilliantly looked at, as Frost was largely the British equivalent of Johnny Carson back in the day, and was thus not deemed worthy by American television to interview the disgraced former commander-in-chief. On the other side of the coin, of course, there's Nixon, of whom millions upon millions of words continue to be written and spoken about. By the time he was interviewed by Frost, he was resigned to a life of continuous brooding and still unwilling to repent for the sins he did in office. With this true-life setup in place, Sheen and Langella engage in a very taut verbal duel that reaches a chilling climax when Langella's Nixon explains to Frost, 'When the president does something, that means it's NOT illegal!' Under Frost's rather withering cross-examination, Nixon was finally forced to admit that he had let the country down; and while there was no admission of remorse, no 'I'm sorry' ever spoken by the man, it was clear he needed to make some kind of repentance if he ever wanted to be seen by future historians in a better light.As was the case with Anthony Hopkins' performance of the 37th president in Oliver Stone's 1995 film NIXON, Langella's performance in FROST/NIXON is a performance of incredible darkness and complexity, much like the real Richard Nixon himself. The toughness that Nixon displayed also revealed the demons that drove him to order the crimes that got committed under that all-encompassing Watergate umbrella. Frost, meanwhile, was heretofore taken far more seriously in America for taking on the challenge of getting Nixon to come out with the admission of personal failure, if not with an out-and-out apology. Howard's direction is as effective as it had been in APOLLO 13; and Sheen and Langella are incredible, as are supporting players like Kevin Bacon, Patty McCormack, Oliver Platt, and Sam Rockwell.In the end, I found FROST/NIXON to be an incredible piece. David Frost came out as a TV personality who fought against enormous odds and won, while Richard Nixon came across as being quite sympathetic, given the magnitude of the kinds of crimes he committed as President. This is a film that should be seen for anyone interested in how politics and the American media have intersected throughout modern history.",10,4,7,27 December 2008
The Monuments Men," The Half-'Dirty Dozen' Of The Art World
","Among the many horrific things about Adolf Hitler and his nightmarish visions of a Third Reich, which began with destroying everything Jewish (including the Jewish people themselves, of course), was the fact that the German army, under his orders, was stealing every piece of art from every museum in Europe, intending to display them all in his so-called 'Fuhrer Museum' in his hometown of Linz, Austria or, in case of his country falling to the Allies or him being found dead, to burn and destroy all of that art, thus eliminating one thousand years of human history and creativity from the books. Into this fray stepped a half-dozen Americans with backgrounds in art. They are the subject of what is one of the best World War II-era films of recent vintage, THE MONUMENTS MEN, based on the book of the same name by Robert M. Edsel and Bret Witter.George Clooney, who co-wrote and co-produced the film as well as directed it, is the man leading the charge to save as much of this priceless art as is humanly possible before Hitler and his goons send it to the flames. Matt Damon, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, Bill Murray, Hugh Bonneville and Jean Dujardin are the art experts that go along with him on this mission, a mission that began within a month of the D-Day landings that commenced the liberation of Europe. In short order, they manage to recover many great works of art stolen from the great art museums in Amsterdam and Paris, with some of the information coming from the contact that Damon makes with a French art curator and resistance member (Cate Blanchett). But they soon learn that huge quantities of art are being stored in various mine shafts in the interior of Germany, making their task even more pressing, and especially given that Hitler's defeat is nigh. In getting into the heart of Germany, going along with convoys of U.S. and Allied forces, the team must engage in firefights with German soldiers they had hoped to avoid. Finally, they get to the mine complex where the biggest and most important works of art in human history have been stored and hidden by the Nazi regime. And they don't have very long to get it.Clooney and his co-writer/co-producer Grant Heslov would be forgiven if they had designed this as a combination of World War II 'impossible mission' films like STALAG 17, THE GREAT ESCAPE, and THE DIRTY DOZEN with various 'heist' movies; but since this is a true story that few people in the world had ever heard about prior to the publication of the book the film is based on, it adds realism to the piece. Instead of being tough-nosed hard cases like we've seen in many classic World War II movies, the men involved, even Clooney, are closer to the 'Everyman' archetype that most audiences can readily identify with the best. The film is not without its moments of humor, of course, given that solid seriocomic actors like Goodman and Murray are involved; but Clooney doesn't avoid some of the slightly grimmer aspects of the story either, such as the discover of a whole satchel full of gold fillings, knocked out of the teeth of Jews in the concentration camps. Some of the laconic dialogue among the guys is reminiscent of what we got in THE GREAT ESCAPE; and even the score by Alexandre Desplait has a main title theme that has the jauntiness of Elmer Bernstein's score for that classic 1963 film.All the cast performs admirably in the film, especially Clooney, given the fact that he is doing double duty being both in front of and behind the camera. Although the horrors of war are largely de-emphasized, the scenes of the bombed-out and burned-out French and German towns do have the feel of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Clooney and Heslov also give the Germans a more nuanced but no less frightening portrait of venality and greed in the manner of what we saw in SCHINDLER'S LIST or CROSS OF IRON; they are not all the stereotypical goose-stepping goons. And while it is never easy to talk about too much of what went on during World War II as being 'good' in the standard sense, THE MONUMENTS MEN is a film that proved that it's possible. Given that its subject is about saving the greatest works of art of the entire human race from the madness of one man's dreams of global empire and destruction, that is indeed saying a lot about us as a race that can only be described as 'good.'",10,3,7,19 February 2014
Miracle," Victory On Ice
","With a professional and intense performance by Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks, MIRACLE, the story of the U.S. Olympic hockey team's miraculous win over the vaunted Soviets at the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York, is by far one of the best true-life sports movies ever made.Russell definitively captures the intensity of Brooks, who in real life just missed the cut on the 1960 Olympic hockey team at Squaw Valley (where the Soviets last lost) and has now been given the task of fielding what the U.S. Olympic Committee wants--the best team of hockey players.  But Russell is after something more--like the RIGHT team of hockey players, the right combination that will ensure not only competitiveness but also give a winning edge to the squad once the Olympics start.  Though he resorts to cajoling, temper outbursts that would nearly rival anything Bobby Knight ever did, and extremely strenuous skating exercises, the team gradually grows to respect him and, in one of the great moments in sports history, Brooks' team defeats the vaunted Soviets 4-3 in the Olympic semifinals, setting themselves up for the subsequent gold medal win against Finland.Aside from Patricia Clarkson (as Brooks' wife) and Noah Emmerich (as Brooks' assistant coach), the main cast of MIRACLE consists of real-life hockey players, not actors.  This adds a great measure of realism to the proceedings, as do the television news flashbacks to a turbulent post-Vietnam America and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan only two months before Lake Placid.  But MIRACLE is not a jingoistic sports film that tilts the balance so heavily in favor of 'our side'; it is simply a story of America getting itself something to be proud of at a time when we so desperately needed it.The real-life Herb Brooks, sadly, didn't get to see this film; he passed away shortly after principal photography was completed, and MIRACLE is thus dedicated to him.  He would no doubt have been as proud of what this film accomplished on the big screen as what he and his Olympic squad did on the ice nearly a quarter century ago.",8,0,0,10 May 2004
Captain Phillips," 'They're not here to fish'
","While we were fighting terrorists in two different theaters of war after the 9/11 attacks, nobody could have anticipated than an old-world form of terrorism, namely high-seas piracy, would come back in style. But that's what befell the crew of the American cargo ship Maersk Alabama in April 2009, when four Somali pirates took over their vessel, resulting in a three-day ordeal in which the captain of the ship, Richard Phillips, was held hostage for a $10 million ransom. That ransom was never paid; and a team of Navy Seals managed to end the crisis by killing the four pirates, who had been holding Phillips hostage in an escape boat less than two hundred miles from the Somali coast. Phillips and his crew, however, all survived the horrific ordeal, shaken but alive. This is the true story told in the movie CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, based on the book 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea' by Phillips and co-writer Stephan Talty.Effectively directed by Paul Greengrass, whose penchant for docudrama was perhaps best established in the much-lauded, and intense, 2006 9/11 film UNITED 93, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS stars Tom Hanks in the title role, of the captain who, aware that armed Somali pirates were present in the waters of the Indiana Ocean some six hundred miles east of Somalia, urges his crew to keep a lookout for any skiffs that seem to contain armed men. One such group, led by Abdi, approaches them; but through some skillful maneuvers, they manage to evade them. The next day, however, the Maersk Alabama isn't so lucky. Armed with automatic weaponry and with a better knowledge of American cargo ship tactics, Abdi and his four companions board the ship and hold Hanks and a few others hostage (this while Hanks has managed to get the rest of his crew below deck and out of sight. When one of the hijackers gets his foot badly injured by broken glass, Hanks urges them to get help, and leaves with them in the ship's escape boat. The pirates believe that Hanks is willing to be a hostage in an act of self-sacrifice; but all along, his crew on the Maersk Alabama, are tailing him and his captors; and the decision is made from Washington to end the crisis by the use of the Navy's elite Seal Team Six (the same one that would, in 2011, track down and kill Osama Bin-Laden). It all comes down to a fierce confrontation within a hundred miles of the Somali coastline.The same sense of realism that infused UNITED 93 also informs CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, with Greengrass and his director of photography Ackroyd doing things largely in the same documentary, almost cinema verite, style that had worked for both UNITED 93 and Greengrass' 2002 docudrama BLOODY Sunday. Just as much of the success of the film, however, is also owed to the incredible Everyman performance of Hanks in the title role. His ability to do the Everyman role, exemplified in his portrayal of astronaut Jim Lovell in the 1995 Ron Howard classic APOLLO 13, works out quite well for him; and Barkhad Abdi makes for a particularly great adversary. There is a real sense of Greengrass, as he had done on UNITED 93 (as well as Hanks on APOLLO 13) of not wanting to do everything in CAPTAIN PHILLIPS as your typical Hollywood action blockbuster, and the end result, along with an intense score by Henry Jackman (which also interpolates the climactic cue of John Powell's score for UNITED 93) being the icing on this cake, is a tremendous piece—indeed, one of the best films of 2013, in the final analysis.",10,16,27,18 October 2013
Catch Me If You Can," Making A Dishonest Living
","Once again, director Steven Spielberg pulls another one of his patented surprises with CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, a juicy crime caper film set in the 1960s and based on the exploits of Frank Abagnale Jr., a young man who ran away from home and went on a three-year spree of check forgery amounting to over $4 million.  Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Abagnale, who managed to impersonate a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, and pretty much every other legitimate line of work to make himself rich before FBI agent Carl Hanratty finally caught up with him.As played by the always-reliable Tom Hanks, Hanratty is a dedicated and cunning foil for DiCaprio's con-man Abagnale.  The two men find themselves locked into a deliciously suspenseful game of cat and mouse that frequently resembles Hitchcock's great caper films of the 50s.  The main titles sequence is priceless in its own right (if one didn't know better, one would swear this film had actually been made in the early 1960s), and John Williams concots a jazzy score redolent of Henry Mancini's classic 60s film scores.  Featuring co-starring turns by Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen, and Jennifer Garner, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is yet another triumph for Spielberg, one of the greatest directing geniuses in Hollywood history.",9,1,1,28 December 2002
The Ring," Unsettling thriller
","I've always felt that the most effective horror films are not the ones that have tons of blood and gore, or ones that just give you scare after scare, and the effect wears off when the lights come up.  The truly effective ones are the films that leave you shuddering for days after.  THE RING is a case in point.Naomi Watts stars as a Seattle newspaper writer who delves into the mysterious deaths of four friends of hers who apparently died after watching a strange videotape on a TV at an isolated mountain cabin.  When she watches it for herself, she sees the tape's grainy, nightmarish black-and-white images, beginning and ending with a mysterious ring.  It is immediately followed by a phone call, where the mysterious caller intones 'Seven Days'--implying that she too will die, like her friends, within a week of having seen that videotape for herself.  She and her boyfriend (Martin Henderson) begin a search for how the tape was made, who made it, and why it was made.  The result is an unsettling mix of psychological and supernatural horror, with implications of Satanic imagery scattered throughout.Though it is a reworking of a 1998 Japanese film, THE RING manages to succeed on its own.  At first, it seems to start out as yet another teen-horror slasher film; but as time goes along, both director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger fashion a heart-pounding, chilling, and disturbing thriller.  There are a number of great shock effects, but none that are particularly gory.  THE RING is largely fashioned as a horror mystery.  In that case, it is much like THE SIXTH SENSE, even down to the details of Watts' son (David Dorfman) who knows more than what he's telling.Watts gives a very effective performance as the reporter; and the suspense is well-handled by Verbinski.  The score by Hans Zimmer is equally chilling, and at many points uses a variation the celebrated 'Dies Irae' (Day of Wrath) theme, one that had been effectively used before in such films as THE SHINING and POLTERGEIST.  THE RING is not a scream-laden fest, but one that gets under the skin and into the mind.  On that count, it is extraordinarily effective.",Null,0,0,11 November 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," 35 Years Later: It's Not The Years, Honey; It's The Mileage
","Where to begin? Writing this review, it has now been thirty-five years since this crazy Steven Spielberg/George Lucas homage to B-movie adventure serials of the 1930s was unleashed on an unsuspecting world in the late spring/early summer of 1981; and even with the three sequels that it has spawned (thus far) and the myriad imitations it has spawned, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK still has to rank as one of the high points of the action film genre's entire history. There's no question that there are elements of the film that are very dated nowadays, not to mention ethnic stereotypes that were wrong then and are even more wrong today. But for sheer artistic and cinematic verve, this still ranks as a Hollywood popcorn extravaganza par excellence.There's no need any longer to go into plot, as we all know it involves Harrison Ford as the intrepid archaeologist Indiana Jones battling the Nazis in a race to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant and the unspeakable power locked inside it. But it is instructive to remember how big a deal this film was to all involved. Lucas had already struck a colossal gold mine with the first two STAR WARS films that had Ford as Han Solo; and Spielberg could boast having made two huge hits of his own in JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. Spielberg, however, had also gone well over schedule and budget on both of those two; and he did it again on his 1979 World War II comedy '1941', so much so that that film's poor critical and commercial finish almost finished him as a director. It was important for him that he deliver a film that could stick to both schedule and budget, yet still be good enough to be a hit. Fortunately, Lucas gave him that chance here; and with careful execution, all of the intended goals were achieved, and then some.The two big action sequences, Ford's outrunning a rolling boulder in the famous opening prologue, and the truck chase across the Sinai Desert (eight minutes of hair-raising tension created in no small part by Ford doing his own stunt work) still must rank as some of the best of their kind ever pulled off. It also helps that Ford shows the kind of honest human vulnerability you don't find in most other action heroes (Stallone; Schwarzenneger, etc.); as he tells his girlfriend (Karen Allen): 'It's not the years, honey; it's the mileage', which is more than a little true. There are moments where the violence, tame though it is by 21st century standards, did make some audiences back in 1981 a little squeamish (the face-melting that takes place in the opening of the Ark at the film's climax is still a tad bit sick); one must remember that this was rated 'PG', and the controversy surrounding the violence here and in its immediate sequel INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM led to the creation of the 'PG-13' rating. But there is also a certain amount of comedy relief as well, involving Ford's squeamish behavior around all forms of snakes, and the famous split-second shooting of an Arab swordsman, improvised downward from a big sword fight because Ford had eaten some bad local food on the day the scene was shot. The Nazi villains are, of course, cardboard villains (since the film was set in 1936, before anyone knew what Hitler and his minions were really up to, it was easier to do it that way); but Ford's nemesis Belloq (Paul Freeman) and the devious Toht (Ronald Lacey) are a couple of really nefarious heavies that give Ford's Indiana Jones something to chew on. And it wouldn't be right not to acknowledge Allen's slightly sardonic contribution to the film as well, especially when she knocks one knife-wielding goon cold with a skillet in the basket chase scene, an hysterically funny moment.And finally, no review of this film would be complete without giving a nod to John Williams, whose score here, like many of his other contributions to the art of film scoring, gives the film its voice, from the famous Raiders March to the brass-choired Nazi theme during the truck chase. The end result is a masterpiece of the entire action genre that holds up even to this day, both real in other ways and fanciful in others, but with a balance that most of today's $200 million-plus sound-and-fury 'blockbusters' may never be able to match.",10,0,0,27 July 2016
Deepwater Horizon," The Blowout In The Gulf
","With the emphasis on producing alternative forms of energy in the 21st century to avert the consequences of climate change and global warming, the drilling for oil and natural gas nevertheless continues to be a real thing—and, inevitably, a real problem, in terms of oil spills. The massive 1989 Exxon Valdez catastrophe off of Alaska, and the blowout of an oil rig off of Santa Barbara, California in February 1969 all demonstrated how catastrophic the consequences of oil drilling can be, not only to the people who work in such a profession, but also (and much more importantly) to the animal life that is destroyed. But the most catastrophic example in this arena occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, fifty miles off of the Louisiana coastline, when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig suffered a massive blowout on the evening of April 21, 2010. The blowout, which basically destroyed the rig, lasted eighty-seven days before it was fully contained; and in that time, eleven workers on that rig died, and some 210 million gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf, and eventually onto the Gulf Coast itself, destroying tons of marine and other forms of animal life, and severely crippling the region's economic livelihood for years to come. That story is the basis of DEEPWATER HORIZON.Mark Wahlberg and Kurt Russell portray, respectively, Mike Williams and Jimmy Harrell, two of the most important workers on the Deepwater Horizon, who are mightily and rightly concerned about the safety corners that have been severely curtailed by the cost-cutting measures of the rig's owner, British Petroleum, whose American representative (John Malkovich) agrees with the orders coming from the company's main headquarters in London. Despite being a $186 billion company, British Petroleum, or BP, apparently either can't afford to, or finds it totally unnecessary to, run the necessary safety tests in order to ensure that something catastrophic doesn't occur. And then on that fateful night, during a pressure test, mud and a little bit of crude oil start gushing onto the top part of the rig, whose pipes extend some five thousand feet into the depths of the sea. Then a monstrous blowout occurs, and the entire rig becomes a flaming pyre on the surface of the Gulf. Both Wahlberg and Russell are badly injured in the blast, but Wahlberg does manage to rescue the systems captain Andrea Fleytas (portrayed by Gina Rodriguez, the star of the TV sitcom 'Jane The Virgin') in time. Though most of the workers do get off the rig before the worst occurs (albeit barely), eleven of their colleagues are left to perish.In its depiction of this environmental horror story, DEEPWATER HORIZON does a fairly good job of showing how a typical crew of oil rig workers operates fairly far away from the shoreline; but it also points out how corporate greed can also trump safety and why, even though it is the right of the workers to speak up about safety without fear of losing their jobs and their livelihood, it can sometimes be just a little too easy to look the other way. Wahlberg, Russell, and Rodriguez, along with the colleagues they are responsible for, have a huge amount of qualms about the integrity of the cement casing of the pipes that is supposed to protect the right, along with the electronic and mechanical safety procedures; but their concerns are ignored by Malkovich until it is basically too late to stop an environmental and human catastrophe of staggering proportions. The screenplay by Matthew Michael Carnahan (who did the script for Robert Redford's 2007 film LIONS FOR LAMBS) and Matthew Sand doesn't exactly paint the workers as being without fault, and Peter Berg's direction almost seems to say as much,. Despite that flaw, the horrific disaster itself is well staged, and the video clips of the real-life incident well integrated into the editing.Both Wahlberg and Russell, not surprisingly, are quite good, as is Malkovich in what could be called the 'heavy' role; but it is Rodriguez, normally thought of as a comedic actress, who really seems to stand out among all the machismo, providing a more human (as well as feminine) face amongst the testosterone. Even more, DEEPWATER HORIZON, besides being an (albeit mild) indictment of corporate malfeasance, is also very much an indictment of the dismissive attitudes of the oil/gas industry towards the harm their activities do to other peoples and businesses, and why such an industry perhaps needs to be shut down forever.",9,1,3,4 October 2016
United 93," UNITED 93--An Intense But Moving Film
","Like Pearl Harbor, Vietnam, Watergate, and the assassination of John Kennedy, the events of September 11, 2001 are burned into the American soul for all time--the day in which a four-pronged terrorist plot using hijacked commercial aircraft killed at least three thousand people. But one of those hijacked flights did not reach its target because the passengers on board had other ideas. And it is that part of 9/11 that is explored here in UNITED 93.United Airlines Flight #93 was en route from Newark to San Francisco on that day, when four Al-Qaeda operatives stormed the cockpit, killed the pilots, and took control of the craft, aiming it for a specific target, which may very well have been the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington. What the hijackers hadn't counted upon was that the passengers on board, using both their cell phones and the phones already installed inside the passenger area, were made aware of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. As such, at least a dozen of them made a valiant effort to retake control of the craft. And while their efforts were doomed to end in a field sixty miles outside of Pittsburgh, they saved perhaps tens of thousands more in our nation's capitol.British-born director and writer Paul Greengrass, who directed the 2004 Robert Ludlum adaptation THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, is scrupulous in detailing this intense and deeply moving saga. Though of course he can only speculate as to exactly what went on inside United 93 as the nightmare unfolded, by using the very same civilian and military air traffic personnel that were on duty that day and found themselves faced with an apocalyptic reality, he is able to depict in a microcosm what all Americans were going through on 9/11. Greengrass also wisely does not populate UNITED 93 with big-name stars portraying the passengers, the terrorists, or crew, thus largely avoiding charges that he would exploit these events for the almighty box office dollar. And by avoiding the political rhetoric that the tragic day has been used for since, he puts our focus squarely on the ordinary, average people simply fighting for their own lives and maybe thousands more, irrespective of false patriotism or jingoistic flag-waving.Undoubtedly, and understandably, many will complain that it's too soon for a film to be made about that day. But when *WOULD* be the appropriate time to do it? One must remember that films about the 1978 Jonestown cult massacre and the 1976 Entebbe hijacking saga were made either for the small or big screen within under two years of those events; and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN was released twenty months after the Watergate scandal ended with Nixon's resignation. And while there's no way for Greengrass to avoid the violence of the situation he's dealing with in UNITED 93 (hence the 'R' rating) and still be truthful, he is never exploitative in his approach. It is unquestionably an intense and quite painful film, one of the most intense films to have been made in many years, but it is also a deeply moving film about pure human heroism in the midst of a paralyzing nightmare, and it is an honest tribute to those who died on that day in general, and this flight in particular.",10,0,2,9 May 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," E.T. Phones Home A Billion-Dollar Movie
","Nearly twenty years since it was first released on the world, Steven Spielberg's 1982 sci-fi/fantasy masterpiece E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL remains one of the greatest movies ever made.  This is one of those films that makes us feel and think at the same time.Its story of a very benign alien being accidentally left stranded on Earth and protected by a ten year-old boy (Henry Thomas) from government agents is so well known it doen't really have to be discussed.  E.T. is, alternately, magical, fantastic, suspenseful, and sometimes even a bit terrifying.  And sprinkled throughout the film are singular moments that really stand out as some of the most unforgettable scenes in cinematic history; by this time, I think we know what those are.  For me, perhaps the most priceless scene is the introduction between E.T. and Gertie (Drew Barrymore), where she screams her head off,  It is one of the very few times where I've wanted to laugh and scream at the same time!Spielberg's film, though scripted by Melissa Mathison, is almost painfully autobiographical, given what the director has said about his childhood. Like Spielberg, Thomas' character goes through life minus a father, even though his mother (Dee Wallace) does her best.  He feels isolated and picked upon in school, as Spielberg frequently did.  There is also plenty of religious symbolism that probably doesn't need any analysing and was probably unintentional.  In any case, looking past the fact that it won four Oscars--for sound, sound effects editing, special effects, and John Williams' legendary music score--and has grossed over $1 billion, E.T. is a masterpiece of the cinema, pure and simple, and it will always be that way.",10,1,2,27 December 2001
Minority Report," A Man On The Run From A Crime He May or May NOT Commit
","Spielberg's latest opus is a tremendously energetic science fiction/suspense thriller set in the year 2053 that is extremely timely now given the current climate of fear and paranoia in our country.Tom Cruise is the head cop of a unique Washington D.C. law enforcement agency known as Pre-Crime.  The agency's purpose is to stop crimes before they have a chance to be committed, and there are three Pre-Cogs (pre-cognitive beings) that can see these crimes of the future.  Max von Sydow is the CEO of Pre-Crime who is anxious to take his creation to a national level, given that it has reduced the D.C. murder rate down to zero. But an ambitious assistant attorney general (Colin Farrell) has put a flaw into the system, and the Pre-Cogs envision a murder to be committed by Cruise himself.  Soon, Cruise is on the run, trying to prove his innocence but also needing to know how things are going to turn out.Based on a 1956 short story by Phillip K. Dick, whose writings provided the basis for TOTAL RECALL and BLADE RUNNER, MINORITY REPORT, even at 135 minutes, is energetic, fast-paced, and hugely suspenseful.  Under Spielberg's usual top-notch direction, Cruise gives another fine performance as the hero of the piece; and Samantha Morton is equally fine as the Pre-Cog named Agatha, who assists him.  The visual effects work of Industrial Light & Magic is quite incredible, the look of the film is stunning, and John Williams contributes another innovative score of the same stripe he gave to A.I., Spielberg's previous and  unjustly maligned movie.Combining the obvious science fiction futurism with elements of the crime and psychological thriller genres, MINORITY REPORT is a film that must be seen more than once for the viewer to absorb every little nuance, because there are many such nuances throughout this film.  The result is the finest film of the year 2002.",10,0,0,25 August 2002
Gravity," The GRAVITY Of This Outer Space Situation
","Probably about as original and realistic a film as one could be that is set in the vastness of space, even if it is just above the Earth's atmosphere, that Hollywood has made after films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, MAROONED, and APOLLO 13, films that it resembles quite strikingly at times, GRAVITY stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts doing a routine repair job on the Hubble Space Telescope who find themselves in the middle of a crisis when a huge debris field, created by the accidental missile hit on a Russian satellite, destroys both the space shuttle and the telescope itself, and the remaining shuttle crew. The horrifying incident leaves the two of them stranded some 300 miles above the Earth's surface, with only their spacesuits for protection against the airless and soundless vacuum of the void.Clooney sacrifices himself in order to get Bullock into the remaining Soyuz escape pod still attached to the heavily damaged International Space Station; but again, many further complications arise. Only after a hair-raising, eye-popping dilemma does Bullock get into the pod and head for the nearby Chinese space station, which itself has suffered tremendous damage. Bullock, understandably in a huge panic, has only a limited amount of time before she gets into the Chinese escape pod and survives the intense heat of re-entry, not to mention another debris field created by the Chinese space station as it re-enters the atmosphere.Whether seen in the regular wide screen format, in 3-D, or in the specialized IMAX 3-D (where it would share a further comparison with the 1987 IMAX documentary about the space shuttle program, THE DREAM IS ALIVE), GRAVITY succeeds as great science fiction; and while it is at times overwhelmed with the 3-D process and the avalanche of special CGI effects (though the budget stayed at $80 million), the effects don't overshadow the storyline or the characters, which is a marked and refreshing contrast from most Hollywood big-budget spectacles of the 21st century. What is perhaps most remarkable about GRAVITY is that it was a Mexican-born filmmaker, Alfonso Cuaron (who also directed 2001's Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, and 2004's HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN), who both directed and co-wrote it (along with his son Jonas). Even with all the ultra-high tech bells and whistles at his disposal, Cuaron in general has made a film that has a lot of the grace of '2001', the extreme tension of MAROONED, and the dogged realism of APOLLO 13, films that it can stand up to comparison quite well.Most of the film's focus is on Bullock using her intelligence and hard-won courage to ensure her own survival, which had best been hinted at before in the 1994 action blockbuster SPEED. Even Clooney is on for only the first 40 minutes of this 90-minute saga; and Ed Harris, who portrayed NASA flight director Gene Kranz in APOLLO 13, is only credited with being the voice of Mission Control. In essence, GRAVITY is an outer space character study, and Bullock is the character in question; and she carries that role quite well. All of these things serve to make GRAVITY one of the best films of 2013.",10,6,11,4 October 2013
Passengers," In The Cosmos With Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt
","Even with Hollywood's decades-long infatuation with CGI, which has caused the cost of such films to escalate into the $100-200 million range, there are moments of levity when such visual effects are put to solid use in the service of a story and not to the salaries of the effects men generating them, nor even necessarily to what studios think the audience might want. During the second decade of the 21st century, we have had at least three films that fit such a bill: 2013's GRAVITY (with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock); 2014's INTERSTELLAR (with Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway); and 2015's THE MARTIAN (with Matt Damon). And in 2016, there was a fourth film to join this illustrious group: PASSENGERS, a combination of intergalactic romance and science fiction.The setting is aboard the starship Avalon, on a 120-year journey across the galaxy to a place called Homestead II, a new interstellar colony. The crew number 258, and the total number of civilian passengers five thousand—all of whom are in a deep state of hibernation, to be awakened within four months of reaching Homestead II, which Avalon is traveling to at half the speed of light. But something on the ship has gone haywire, and one of the hibernation pods has allowed a deep-space engineer (Chris Pratt) to awaken a mere thirty years into the journey, meaning that he will almost certainly die before anyone else awakens. In spending a full year in trying to find the cause of the hibernation malfunction, he also awakens a female journalist (Jennifer Lawrence); and they work at figuring out what has actually gone wrong. In the course of exploring the ship, and despite Lawrence's extreme rancor at Pratt having awakened her way too soon, they not only try to find a solution to an incredibly complex practical issue, but also find the chance to fall in love with whatever time they have left. A third person (Laurence Fishburne), a member of the crew (all of whom are still somehow in hibernation), assists them in finding the cause of Avalon's malfunction; and unfortunately it is actually hundreds of little problems morphing into one huge intergalactic nightmare.Morton Tyldum, a Norwegian director whose previous credits included the highly acclaimed 2014 World War II docudrama THE IMITATION GAME, manages to make what could have been a potentially sticky and sentimental deep space film, courtesy of screenwriter Joe Spaihts (who co-wrote the screenplay for director Ridley Scott's 2012 sci-fi/horror opus PROMETHEUS), into something far more substantial and thought-provoking than a lot of critics, and even some audiences, have given it credit for. Certainly Pratt and Lawrence make for an appealing pair; and the potential for them having passionate lovemaking is there at certain points of the film. In the end, though, the focus is on survival and the inherent dangers of both interstellar travel and technology that doesn't always work the way we might want it to. Much like both GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR, PASSENGERS has a few distinct homages to director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, as well as to Steven Spielberg's A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT, and the 2008 Disney film WALL-E. But just for good measure, in the early parts of the film, there is an android bartender named Arthur (Michael Sheen), who looks like a dead ringer for Lloyd, the supernatural bartender portrayed by Joe Turkel in Kubrick's 1980 horror classic THE SHINING; and even the expansive set of the lounge has the look (albeit in the height of high tech) of the Gold Room in that film.The scattered action sequences keep PASSENGERS from seeming too cerebral and slow (a criticism still lodged against '2001' by critics who really should know better), but the spacious production design and the CGI depictions of deep space keep the film from being a testosterone fest, and grounded in a certain amount of reality, again much like GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR. Lawrence, known for her roles in the Hunger Games franchise and JOY, and Pratt, who starred in the 2015 box office smash JURASSIC WORLD, anchor the film's human element; and Newman, whose many scores include WALL-E and BRIDGE OF SPIES, among many others, provides a great music score of a very neo-futuristic kind. At a time when really good filmmaking that involves special effects work is hard to find, and total suspension of disbelief is all too easy to find, PASSENGERS illustrates just how well a certain sense of cosmic wonder, realism, and humanity can come off in 21st century Hollywood.",9,1,2,10 April 2017
127 Hours," Survival In The Utah Badlands
","True-life survival stories often make for compelling films, but it would seem after the idea of 'survivalist' was appropriated by the highly rated CBS-TV 'reality' show Survivor that this particular genre had run its course. As any discerning person will attest to, however, Survivor and other like-minded TV shows are really merely game shows or contests roughened up for the participants. Such a fact can be borne out by the artistic success of a film like director Danny Boyle's 127 HOURS, one of the best films of 2010, though it has caused some consternation among film goers for the very method of survival it depicts.The film is based on the experiences of Colorado-born adventurer Aron Ralston (portrayed by James Franco), who had gone out on a cross-country hike in the badlands of southern Utah in late April 2003. He hiked into isolated Bluejohn Canyon some thirty miles outside the Utah town of Moab and, while repelling down a cliff into the bottom of a canyon, dislodged a sizable rock and then slipped. The rock wedged his right arm between it and the wall of the canyon, and he remained stuck there for 127 hours, or just over five days in all. Braving temperatures that ranged from the lower 90s during the day to below 50 degrees at night, he had to be careful how he used his water, and he documented his story and his personal musings on his camcorder, trying very hard to dislodge the rock that was keeping him in place by chipping away at it with a rather cheap made-in-China pocket knife. It only seemed to prolong the agony, because the rock was never dislodged. With very little time left, and his water supply running dangerously low, he was forced to do the unthinkable with that very same knife.Although Boyle, known for such films as TRAINSPOTTING, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, and the grisly 2002 zombie flick 28 DAYS LATER, makes the same mistake his fellow British director Tony Scott has done on his films via the use of an occasionally loud industrial-type rock score by A.R. Rahman and sometimes jerky camera movements, he mostly sticks to the facts surrounding Ralston's life and ordeal. As portrayed quite well by Franco, Ralston comes off as a fairly cocky young man with a penchant for extreme adventure who found out how high a price can be paid for forgetting what it can often take to survive such an adventure. The film bears a significant similarity to ALIVE, the 1993 film in which where the participants of that true-life ordeal (the 1972 Andean plane crash saga) were forced to survive their ordeal in one of the worst ways possible, in that case by resorting to cannibalism. Here, of course, Ralston, totally alone, cut off from the outside world in an isolated chasm where few people would have ever dared to go by themselves, had no other choice but to do what he did, which meant losing the lower half of his right arm in the process.Although it is understandable that the scene in question would leave a lot of people extremely queasy, this is every bit as unavoidable an aspect of the story as was the cannibalism in ALIVE, even though it takes up three to five minutes near the film's climax. Boyle can sometimes be accused of going too far with the viscera in his other films; and the scene is still quite shocking, even when compared to the opening twenty minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Still, thanks in large part to the way Franco portrays the change in Ralston's behavior from happy-go-lucky adventurer to a survivor almost reduced to nothing, 127 HOURS is a compelling film, especially given the fact that Boyle decided to film it in the very locations in Utah where Franco's saga took place. Besides being a compelling, if somewhat uneasy, film, it shows us how precious life is, and not to take it for granted, as the real-life Aron Ralston did with nearly fatal results.",9,0,2,3 December 2010
Spotlight," 'They knew about it, and they let it happen'
","There are times when God can be used by people who ought to know better to justify doing horrible things to others. The sex abuse scandal inside the Catholic church, which may very well have been going on for decades under the table, was one of those things; and it was exposed perhaps for the first time in one of the most heavily Catholic cities in the world, namely Boston. And it was reporters from the Boston Globe who, undeterred by threats, both implied and overt, conducted a year-long investigation into the pattern of pedophilia and the subsequent cover-up of it by religious and government figures in their city and made it public, causing a worldwide firestorm that in many ways damaged the Catholic church irreparably. That is the story told in director Tom McCarthy's brilliant film SPOTLIGHT.SPOTLIGHT takes its name from that special investigations division of the Boston Globe that tended to uncover the less savory aspects of Boston's higher places of power; and it was that division uncovered the Boston sex abuse scandal. Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Ruffalo portray the three real-life reporters who, bit by bit, gather all the facts about this story, one that Boston's Catholic archdiocese knew about for decades but had successfully buried for an equally long time. What they find out, in ways and through situations that have fairly modest but nevertheless noticeable parallels to the Watergate scandal depicted in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, is that the pattern of priest abuse wasn't just limited to 'a few bad apples', but which involved at least ninety of the Boston archdiocese's 1500 priests, and hundreds, if indeed not thousands, of young children dating as far back as the early 1960s. At the end, once their story hits the front pages of the Globe, which happened just a week or so into 2002, thousands of victims come forth with their own horror stories of encounters with Catholic priests having done decidedly unholy things to them as kids and getting away with it. What had been a local story, and more importantly one that had been kept under wraps forever, would now explode with financially and spiritually catastrophic results for the Catholic Church.There are no 'big scenes', in the strictest conventional Hollywood sense, here in SPOTLIGHT; indeed, much of the story unfolds so methodically. Moreover, none of the three principals outshines the others, which gives the film a decidedly ensemble feel with Keaton, Ruffalo, and McAdams. Liev Schreiber and John Slattery portray the real-life editors at the Globe who urged a press-forward until the paper got a story that was solid and would stand up to any kind of scrutiny. But besides being a great film about an important and still timely issue in American life, SPOTLIGHT is also something of a tragedy, in that these kids continued to bear the scars as adults; and in a faith where God is everything, and priests are looked upon almost as Jesus Himself, those scars and the betrayal that came from them are permanent and damaging.The final victory for SPOTLIGHT is showing what a huge difference free and independent media in America, one beholden only to the news and the truth and not corporate and financial dictates, can make when it does its job. McCarthy and his cast should be roundly and loudly applauded for this film.",10,2,4,22 January 2016
Ready Player One," Spielberg + Virtual Reality = READY PLAYER ONE
","After the huge artistic and commercial success of his 1993 Holocaust epic SCHINDLER'S LIST, director Steven Spielberg may not have totally abandoned the style of action/adventure films he had initiated back in 1981 with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, but he was determined to balance both commercial properties with riskier artistic projects, a trend that has been quite successful for him, right into the 21st century. Films like AMISTAD, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, MUNICH, BRIDGE OF SPIES, and THE POST have balanced themselves alongside more crowd-pleasing fare as THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and THE BFG. And then in 2018, he came up with his most audacious project to date, the futuristic virtual reality action/adventure opus READY PLAYER ONE.Based on the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline (he also co-wrote the screenplay, with Zach Penn), and set in the year 2045, the film stars Tye Sheridan as something of a techno-geek whose only solace from his bleak 'real world' existence is in the futuristic virtual reality world known as The Oasis; and he is by no means alone. The Oasis is a place created by an eccentric video genius named James Halliday (Mark Rylance, who won a Best Supporting Actor in 2015 for BRIDGE OF SPIES) and another man named Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg); and just before Rylance passes away, he offers ownership of the Oasis and a mammoth sum of 'coin' ($250 billion, to be exact) if the right contestant can find the 'Easter egg' hidden inside the world of the Oasis. Sheridan takes up the challenge, along with Olivia Cooke, and three other players he calls the 'Hi Five' to get the three keys that will unlock the clues that eventually lead to Rylance's quarter-trillion dollar Easter egg. But in the meantime, they must battle an underhanded corporate tycoon (Ben Mendelsohn) who is equally anxious to get his hands on that Easter egg. In between the cross-cutting from the 'real' reality to the 'virtual' reality, Sheridan, Cooke, and company go on a huge, visually mind-busting sequence of adventures in the Oasis relating to examples of American pop culture from the late 1970s into the 21st century, including references to KING KONG, GODZILLA, the first two BACK TO THE FUTURE films (both of which Spielberg was executive producer on), A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and, even more shockingly (not to mention amusingly), THE SHINING.It has to be said that a film of this sort, being helmed even by a director known for frequent sensory impacts (including the 'Indiana Jones' films and the first two JURASSIC PARK projects), can seem a bit much; and indeed, READY PLAYER ONE is a bit like the ultimate in sensory overload. Sound-wise, READY PLAYER ONE may very well be the loudest film Spielberg has directed since the 1979 World War II comedy '1941', whose loud explosions, raucous dogfights, and insane mugging by the actors totally drowned out whatever comedy Spielberg might have indeed for that film. The earlier film was also the first instance of Spielberg playing homage to himself (references to DUEL and JAWS were there in '1941'); and apart from the occasional JURASSIC PARK and BACK TO THE FUTURE references, Spielberg stays away from those here (though Cline was known to be a huge Spielberg admirer). Instead, he chooses to highlight other aspects of 1980s culture (along with the Alan Silvestri score that sounds a fair amount like what he did for the BACK TO THE FUTURE series). The most prominent 1980s homage is to THE SHINING, notably its virtual reality recreation of that film's sinister Overlook Hotel and scenes like the horrific hag in Room 237 and the tsunami of blood.Spielberg actually had READY PLAYER ONE finished in the spring of 2017, intending it for a Christmas 2017 release; but once STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI was set for release, he held off until the Easter weekend of 2018, and instead polished off (with seemingly little haste) THE POST. The re-juggling clearly didn't affect the quality of this film (or THE POST, for that matter); and while READY PLAYER ONE can be faulted at times for its emphasis on sound and spectacle (a rare thing for Spielberg, but an all-too-frequent thing for a lot of other 21st century Hollywood blockbusters), it has to be said that Sheridan and Cooke make an appealing young couple; and Rylance turns in another fine performance as the eccentric video game genius. In the end, READY PLAYER ONE is a rarity in Hollywood, in that it's a blockbuster that requires a lot of concentration. But Spielberg, it seems, wouldn't have had it any other way.",10,0,2,6 April 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Who ARE Those Guys?!
","There are a lot of things that make BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID one of the greatest Western films of all times. Take a solid screenplay by William Goldman, put in a great director like George Roy Hill, and pair Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the two titular characters, and the end result is a hugely entertaining and witty adventure that takes us from the high plains of the West to the out-of-the-way jungles of Bolivia.Admittedly the details about the real-life late 19th century outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and their Hole-In-The-Wall gang are softened for purposes of entertainment (the real-life participants were among the most notorious badmen in the history of the Old West), but it is quite a thing to see Newman and Redford get away with so much because we can't help but like them. And when the Union Pacific railroad sends a posse after them following the blowing up of a payroll train, we fear for their lives (as they keep asking themselves 'Who ARE those guys?!'). The two men and their schoolteacher love interest Etta Place (Katharine Ross) hightail it down to Bolivia to continue their outlaw ways; but soon, they become wanted men again as 'Bandidos Yanquis.' Attempts by Newman and Redford to 'go straight' by getting into the employ of an eccentric payroll master (the always-colorful Strother Martin) don't go as planned; and then it all comes down to a standoff in a small Bolivian town.BUTCH CASSIDY was released in the same year (1969) as three other radically different Westerns: the more traditional John Wayne-led, Henry Hathaway-directed TRUE GRIT; Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH; and Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Although not anywhere near as violent as Peckinpah's, nor as surreal as Leone's, this film is still much more cynical than TRUE GRIT, since, like Peckinpah's film, it mourns the loss of the Old West, as progress and road agents are now strangling a once-limitless frontier and forcing outlaws and renegades south. And like Leone, it also shows even the railroad becoming more corporatized as the 20th century dawns. All of this is happening, even as Burt Bacharach's score (complete with 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head') plays on, and we see Butch and Sundance getting away with a whole lot of money and a whole lot of schemes. At the same time, however, after being told by an ornery sheriff (Jeff Corey), 'Your times is over! Don't you get it?!', they realize that they are probably not going to live much longer.As a result, BUTCH CASSIDY, for all the fun it shows us, is every bit as fatalistic as Leone's and Peckinpah's radical restructurings of the Western myths. And yet it is this dichotomy that makes the film such an enduring film of its genre, with Newman and Redford perfectly matched (as they would be again, and with Hill directing, in 1973 for THE STING), and superb cinematography by Conrad Hall. Nobody should miss this film, especially when it comes to being a fan of that most American of film genres, the Western.",10,1,2,18 July 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," The ultimate Cold War satire
","'I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, Communist indoctrination, Communist subversion, and the international Communist conspiracy, to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.'So says General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) in DR. STRANGELOVE, director Stanley Kubrick's ultimate Cold War satire. The film centers on Hayden's deranged general ordering a preemptive nuclear strike against Russia for those very reasons. Peter Sellers pulls off the impossible by playing three roles: President Merkin Muffley; RAF Colonel Lionel Mandrake (Hayden's executive officer); and the half-mad Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove. George C. Scott, in one of his two greatest roles (the other being PATTON), is hilarious as an equally committed (in more ways than one) anti-Commie general who speculates that a reduced retaliation strike against Russia would result in 'no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops!' Factor in the soon-to-be-revealed existence on Russian soil of a Doomsday machine, however, and things become somewhat different.All of these things come together in one chillingly hilarious package. So many great scenes and dialogue abound in DR. STRANGELOVE that this movie remains memorable. The exact political conditions that helped spawn the film no longer exist in the world now, but a new set of circumstances (the dangerous ideological divide between fanatical right-wing Christians in American government, and fanatical Islamists in the Middle East) still make this movie timely even today.What I don't think really gets mentioned all that much in relation to DR. STRANGELOVE is that Kubrick is working on three different tracts. First, of course, there's Hayden's anti-Commie paranoia about the fluoridation of water (a belief actually cherished in reality by the far right in 1950s America). Second, there's the chilling irony that those who are in the best position to prevent a nuclear war are also the ones most willing to start one too. Third is the theme of technology (in this case, the Doomsday machine) that Mankind is either unable or unwilling to control. This last theme would be the subject of many superb sci-fi and suspense films in the ensuing decades, including WESTWORLD, COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT, JURASSIC PARK, THE CHINA SYNDROME, A.I., and most especially Kubrick's next film, the magisterial 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.The end result is perhaps the most corrosive political satire of all time, a consistently hilarious and cutting-edge film about the most frightening subject of our age, and its continued popularity with film buffs and political pundits alike is to be appreciated for all time.",10,2,3,23 July 2001
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick In The Late 18th Century
","Stanley Kubrick was one of those directors who made the kinds of films that were so easily misunderstood and misread upon first viewing. From his first film, 1953's FEAR AND DESIRE, up to the 1960 epic SPARTACUS (which he really only had a modicum of control on, and which he basically dismissed), he stayed within traditional filmmaking bounds. But after LOLITA in 1962, he set out to push those filmmaking bounds out of the way; and from that point on, until his last one, 1999's EYES WIDE SHUT, he was a hero to a great many aspiring filmmakers, and a complete enigma to film critics. Most important of all, he never made the same kind of movie twice, which made him perhaps the most utterly unpredictable director of the post-war cinema. His 1975 costume epic BARRY LYNDON is a case in point.In choosing to do a lavish adaptation of the then-little-known book 'The Luck Of Barry Lyndon' by William Makepeace Thackeray, Kubrick invested his trademark sense of deep, dark irony in depicting an Irish rogue (Ryan O'Neal), who, after winning a duel, goes out in the world to find his fortune. After a series of adventures and misadventures alike, including a stint in Her Majesty's Army, he seems to find the fortune in the guise of Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), but he quickly runs afoul of his newlywed wife's stubborn stepson Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali). It all comes down to a duel between him and Vitali in the barn of the Lyndon estateand there can only be ONE winner.Among the many ways that Kubrick defied audience expectations, this film is one that doesn't movie especially fast. At three hours and four minutes, it's no MTV video; but pretty much after the stately interstellar mood of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, it would be part-and-parcel of this director not only not to give what the audience expects, but to give them something that requires total concentration. Primarily filmed in England and Ireland over a period of twelve to eighteen months at the mid-point of the 1970s, BARRY LYNDON was a fairly expensive movie, at a cost of $11 million, and was, at the time, perhaps Kubrick's most poorly received film; widely mixed critical and audience reactions in America and England resulted in only modest box office returns there, though the film did clean up in Europe.O'Neal has come in for a fair working-over for his portrayal of Barry Lyndon over the last four decades, but I think it is a very good performance, molded as it were under a thorough taskmaster like Kubrick; and the same could be said for Berenson as Lady Lyndon. BARRY LYNDON also features some excellent turns by such British character actors as Patrick Magee, Phillip Stone, Hardy Krueger, Steven Berkoff, Leonard Rossiter, Godfrey Quigley, George Sewell, and Anthony Sharp.The film justifiably won four Oscars: cinematography (John Alcott); costume design (Milena Canonero); production design (Ken Adam, who worked with Kubrick on DR. STRANGELOVE, and Roy Walker); and musical adaptation (primarily of works by Mozart, Paisiello, Schubert, and Handel) by veteran composer Leonard Rosenman (whose credits included GIANT; FANTASTIC VOYAGE; BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APRES; and A MAN CALLED HORSE). Particularly notable in the latter is Rosenman's bold orchestration of the Sarabande from Handel's Keyboard Suite #11, which has since become BARRY LYNDON's musical calling card, much as Richard Strauss' 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' had been for '2001.' And in terms of the photography, Alcott and camera expert Ed Di Giulio did a great thing by giving Kubrick the idea to use very powerful lenses to shoot a number of complex scenes lit only by candlelight, which has been tried by many a period film that followed in the wake of this movie.A great deal of patience is required for BARRY LYNDON; and, as with many a Kubrick film, this one requires many viewings to really understand the various nuances and themes. But a lot of times this is what great films demand, and BARRY LYNDON is an excellent demonstration of such.",9,4,7,15 July 2014
Interstellar," A Voyage Like None Other Seen In 2014
","Given how much Hollywood has been obsessed with mega-budget blockbusters based on comic books or franchise films in the 21st century, it is sometimes easy to forget that certain films of other genres, made on roughly the same budgets can have an impact as well. British director Christopher Nolan's immense and philosophical 2014 science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR is just one such film. It is a film that, much like 1997's CONTACT and 2013's GRAVITY, owes a significant story debt to director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, a debt that Nolan himself freely acknowledges Set in some unknown, far-flung future in which life on Earth is becoming increasingly uninhabitable due to out of control climate chaos, and where massive dust storms are commonplace, the film stars Matthew McConaughey as the chosen leader of an expedition to find new habitats for what's left of Earth's population in the vast reaches of outer space. But to do that, they will have to venture through a black hole that opened up within our own Solar System, around Saturn. They make that ultra-hazardous journey through the black hole, and find three worlds spinning along the vortex, one of which may very well support human life, and another one of which they find a survivor (Matt Damon) of a previous expedition. They are then confronted with the issues of the space-time continuum that was part of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity; and McConaughey is confronted with having left his family behind to face the apocalyptic devastation that he knows awaits him if and when he should return from the far-flung reaches of the universe. But following another trip through the black hole, McConaughey is in for an extremely big surprise, one as much inspired by The Twilight Zone as anything else.Nolan, whose credits include such comic-book smashes as THE DARK KNIGHT and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, as well as psychological thrillers like MEMENTO and INCEPTION, set himself an enormous task in making INTERSTELLAR. In a movie business so overrun with mega-budget movies with lots of CGI special effects, plenty of explosions, over-the-top stunts, and way over-the-top violence, all of which are supposedly 'sure things', he took an extreme risk by expending close to $150 million on a fantastic sci-fi opus that touches on genuine human, psychological, and philosophical concerns for the future of mankind. But as Kubrick, one of Nolan's favorite filmmakers, once observed, nothing is as dangerous as a 'sure thing'; and in making INTERSTELLAR the way he has, along with co-writing the screenplay and largely eschewing CGI for more traditional special effects work, some of which had been seen in CONTACT, he has sought to make his concerns every bit as real as humanly possible, and attempted, more than a little successfully, to follow in the footsteps of '2001' in showing us the possibilities of where Man was going in the universe, and his ultimate place in the cosmos. He has managed to do this in a film that runs slightly under three hours, or about thirty-five minutes longer than even the lengthy and stately Kubrick masterpiece. This will invariably try a lot of audience members' patience, but the truth is that not every film needs to be reduced to childish lowest common denominator simplicity to be very good.Even with so visual a story that INTERSTELLAR has, Nolan hasn't forgotten that people power films as much as the technicians; and having seasoned actors like McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, and Anne Hathaway, and veterans like Michael Caine and John Lithgow, in the cast is certainly something to be proud of. The scenes of the dust storms ravaging McConaughey's home farm in the opening section of the film are frighteningly impressive; and the passage that McConaughey's ship 'Endurance 'takes through the black hole have some of the mythical quality of the Star Gate in '2001', and similar ones in STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE and CONTACT.The keyboards/synthesizers/organ score by Hans Zimmer, who is one of the most prominent composers in film music in Hollywood during the 21st century, does a lot to enhance the immensity and the scope of INTERSTELLAR, as Steven Price's did for GRAVITY. And while it is easy to get wrapped up in the IMAX sound and the visuals of the piece, in the end the overwhelming sense to be gotten out of INTERSTELLAR is, like Kubrick and '2001', a genuine concern for not only film as Art, but the future of Man in the cosmos. That by itself sets it apart from a lot of Hollywood films of the 21st century.And in the final analysis, all of those things make INTERSTELLAR easily one of the best films of 2014.",10,1,5,10 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?
","Throughout his life, director Stanley Kubrick made films that got people talking, both pro and con.  FULL METAL JACKET is one such example.  Though far less emotional and much more analytical than any film about the Vietnam war, this film is nevertheless a brilliant piece.The first 40 minutes of this film deal with Marine boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina.  And they deal with it in a way that no previous film ever dealt with it, thanks to Lee Ermey's inventive and scathingly vicious, profanity-laden performance as Drill Instructor Hartman.  We see the recruits torn down and built up into remorseless killing machines, praying for war.  But one of them, the overweight Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), is about to show us how a remorseless killing machine can malfunction due to one slight imperfection.Once the scene shifts to Vietnam, we find ourselves in the middle of the Tet Offensive, and the realization, as seen by the characters portrayed by Matthew Modine, Arliss Howard, and others, that war is most certainly hell. The most horrifying part is when the platoon led by Howard is caught off guard in the bombed out city of Hue by a VC sniper.  It is there that the true mettle of these men is revealed.A lot of reviewers have mentioned that the first forty minutes of FULL METAL JACKET make the last 76 minutes seem routine by comparison.  I don't think that's the case.  Kubrick is very remorseless in his war scenes and how he handles the violence.  Certainly he takes his swipes at the military in a scathing way reminiscent of DOCTOR STRANGELOVE, and, thanks to Modine, even rips John Wayne's flag-waving patriotism apart ('Is that you John Wayne? Is this me?).  In truth, however, unlike a lot of war films, even PLATOON, Kubrick's film is not merely anti-war, it's apolitical; it does not take sides on the issue.  Complimented by solid acting and a faithful recreation of the Hue battle (filmed in an abandoned gas works plant near Kubrick's home base of London), FULL METAL JACKET is a riveting movie, a must-see for those who appreciate great filmmaking from a consumate master.",10,0,0,16 July 2001
American Sniper," Chris Kyle: Not A Hero Or A Cold-Blooded Killer, But A Man Doing What He Believed Was The Right Thing
","Iraq is a war that, like Vietnam, will continue to divide America for decades and generations to come; and any film that has ever focused in on any aspect of that war is bound to be controversial. So it is with American SNIPER, the 2014 war film from legendary producer/director (and former actor) Clint Eastwood that is based on the memoir of perhaps the most lethal sniper in the history of the wars that America has undertaken, Chris Kyle. Pundits from the Left and Right have had a lot of things to say about the film; but a very careful and clinical look at the film will find out that many of the rantings from each side about it are not necessarily accurate.Bradley Cooper has the very tough job of portraying the life that Kyle, a Texas native, had growing up, and how the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa influenced his decision to join the elite Navy Seals. It is 9/11 that inevitably sends him into a trajectory towards Iraq, where he served four punishing tours of duty and became a 'legend' (to his fellow soldiers there) for his accuracy at hitting 'the bad guys.' But as tough as Kyle was, he pretty soon got tired of being referred to as 'Legend'; and, given the gradual emotional distance between him and his wife (Sienna Miller), he, like hundreds of thousands of veterans before him, began to suffer from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Once he got back home after the fourth tour, during which he engaged in a firefight with an Iraqi militia leader who actually had a $180,000 bounty on his own head, he came back to do his part for veterans who suffered not only from PTSD, but the more obvious physical injuries that war often inflicts on the people who fight them as well. Unfortunately, on February 2, 2013, one of those veterans did what no Iraqi or Al-Qaeda militia fighter could to Kyle, which was to kill him. At the end of American SNIPER, Eastwood utilizes actual TV video footage of the massive funeral procession given to Kyle in his home state of Texas.Cooper doesn't have the easiest job in the world of accurately portraying Kyle, whose attitude toward all Iraqis in his memoir was that they were all 'savages', but he succeeds at this toughest of tasks quite well. For the moment, though, it is, inevitably, that 'savages' part of the memoir, which is slightly tampered down by Eastwood in the film, which is the most fiercely debated and spun aspect of the piece. I personally feel, having seen the film, that both the Left and the Right have gotten American SNIPER wrong in a number of ways. The mistaken criticism of the film by liberals is that Kyle was a product of American warmongers like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney and was 'made' into a killer, when those same liberals have to share some of the blame for allowing the Iraq war to go forward for fear of being branded 'unpatriotic' and 'supporting terrorism.' The more egregious championing of American SNIPER by those on the Far Right, especially wing nuts like Sarah Palin, is that Kyle should somehow be 'celebrated' as a hero for being trained into becoming the best 'killer' the U.S. military ever had, which unfortunately is a terribly dishonest distortion of what war really does, for those who must fight it (like Kyle) and those caught in the middle, both on a physical and on a psychological level. Kyle is not a man who should be either lionized or demonized, but should, like every man and woman who served, be given their due for doing what he believed was right, however much we may have bitterly disagreed with that war.The perception of Eastwood as a right-wing ideologue, which is not the whole picture, obscures the fact that both he and Cooper are even-handed in portraying Kyle, and what our men and women saw in Iraq. It would be enormously misleading to think that this film supports either that war or what Kyle did, because, for one, it doesn't; and for another, it does show what repetitious battle can do to the human psyche, even to one like Chris Kyle. That is how I hope, in the not-too-distant future, American SNIPER can eventually be seen, and not from too many politically distorted angles.",9,20,39,20 February 2015
The Thing," Extremely Gory, But Extremely Intelligent
","In an era where nearly every great horror film of the 60s and 70s is being remade for audiences weaned on horror flicks of today that are not too terribly good, it is instructive to look back at John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING, which itself is a remake--of a childhood favorite of the director's, Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi/horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film was not initially that big a box office hit when released in mid-1982, it has since garnered a very large following.In fact, Carpenter's film is less of a remake of Hawks' film than it is a reworking, as he goes back to the original idea posited by the source material, namely the John W. Campbell story 'Who Goes There?', in which a US scientific crew in Antarctica is menaced by a shape-changing alien thawed out from the ice after 100,000 years. Kurt Russell, who had starred for Carpenter in the director's 1979 TV movie ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, heads a cast of stalwart character actors, including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart, and Richard Masur, in this tension-filled exploration of paranoia, as the shape-changing 'thing', which first comes to their camp in the form of a guide dog a Norwegian team is trying to kill, takes over each of them one by one. It isn't long before everybody in the camp begins to mistrust his fellow man. The ending of the film, in which Russell and David are the only ones left, has a disturbing and chilling ambiguity akin to the similar codas to both THE BIRDS and STRAW DOGS.Almost universally, when the subject of THE THING is bought up, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects make-up and alien designs created by Rob Bottin, who had worked with Carpenter on the 1980 horror classic THE FOG, and on Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf film THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed quite spectacular and graphic, and even today, they can also be quite stomach-turning. But all of this would make Carpenter's film nothing more than a high-end splatter epic if the direction, the story, and the acting weren't up to snuff; and thankfully, each of them are. When he's not concentrating on the enormously gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter builds suspense in the same Hitchcock-influenced way that informed his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG, with cinematographer Dean Cundey's prowling camera-work, particularly through the corridors of the station, a significant help. The acting enhances an already-fine screenplay adaptation by Bill Lancaster; and we are also given a taut score by Ennio Morricone, whose work on director Sergio Leone's classic 1960s Italian spaghetti westerns is well known to all, including of course Carpenter himself. THE THING also features additional fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who worked on many Hitchcock films, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2.Carpenter's film was not the success it could have been because Universal chose to release this graphic shocker a mere two weeks after it had released Steven Spielberg's far more family-friendly E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the time favored Spielberg's excellent film over Carpenter's equally excellent but exceedingly different one). Also, most of the horror film box office business in 1982 was going to another Spielberg-produced film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, at a cost of $15 million, THE THING suffered from lack of attention in its time.Over time, however, many have come to see Carpenter's film for what it is--an extremely gory but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, done with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of its story. Though it is still quite gruesome, THE THING should be as much remembered for the skill by which the story is put together as it is for the gory alien designs and make-up effects; for it is the storytelling skill and the suspense that make it so memorable in the final analysis.",8,3,5,5 November 2006
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg And The Cold War
","The forty-five year period between 1945 and 1990 is one that the whole world knew as the Cold War. During that time, there was a huge struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union for control of how much of the planet should be free or under the yoke of the atheistic system that was Communism; and at several points, that war almost went from cold to hot. In the main, it was primarily a war of intelligence gathering; and the possibility of spies being captured on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain was always a possibility. Such an event is the subject of director Steven Spielberg's 2015 Cold War suspense thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES, the 27th film in this legendary director's career.Tom Hanks, who has made it his business of playing an Everyman, portrays the role of James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer who, in 1957, was thrown into the breach of the Cold War by being forced to defend a KGB agent named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) on three counts related to espionage activity. Although Hanks loses that case in court, Rylance is spared the electric chair because, as Hanks admonishes those in high places, the day may very well come when the Soviet Union might capture one of our spies behind their lines, and that a prisoner exchange might well be necessary.Three years later, in 1960, that very possibility comes to the fore when Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a U-2 pilot working for the CIA, is captured by the Soviet Union after one of their missiles downs his aircraft. Hanks sees a huge opportunity for both countries (neither Rylance nor Stowell have divulged anything to their captors); but this potential boon is tainted by the capture of an American graduate student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) on the wrong side of the newly-completed Berlin Wall in the winter of 1961. Hanks then gets a hard lesson in the bizarre nature of Cold War politics, as Rogers is being held by East German officials, and both they and the Soviets are on different pages when it comes to the Communist political playbook.With the help of some fairly cagey maneuvering on his part, though it is severely looked down by his fellow Americans in general, and his own wife (Amy Ryan) in particular, as coddling an enemy agent, he manages to set up the moment of truth for all three men on the Glienicke Bridge (the actual bridge that is known as the Bridge Of Spies) that separates Berlin from Potsdam, all of this without any shots being fired in anger.Given that these events happened half a century in the past, and that an entire generation has grown up not knowing what the Cold War actually was, almost any other filmmaker might have had a very difficult time making the story clear. But then Spielberg has never been just any other filmmaker, and, being part of that generation that did know the fear that life as they knew it could end in a matter of hours, he knew that this was a story with huge implications, both political and humanistic. BRIDGE OF SPIES is a masterpiece of tension and suspense, with Spielberg continuing to show the influence of Alfred Hitchcock in his work; and Hanks basically does a role not dissimilar to James Stewart in several of Hitchcock's classic films. The depiction of the Cold War is magnified in the way Spielberg depicts the way the Berlin Wall cut off both the eastern and western parts of that city, and how Soviet soldiers cut down those who tried to jump over the wall (not unlike similar scenes involving the Nazi death camps in the director's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST. Rylance gives a superb low-key performance as Abel, a man resigned to his fate whatever it is but willing to accept what comes from it, gaining a lot of respect from Hanks in the process. Spielberg also superbly recreates that horribly tense period of the late 1950s and early 1960s where America was at risk, probably less from its fears of the bomb than its own anti-Soviet paranoia.Because John Williams, Spielberg's long-time collaborator, was unavailable due to health issues, Thomas Newman, part of Hollywood's illustrious film scoring dynasty, stepped in to do the score for BRIDGE OF SPIES; and while it may not have the typical verve of Williams, Newman's score has a lot to recommend it, including the influences of both Shostakovich and Copland, avoiding the easy and (in some ways) expected patriotic cues. Sober and serious much of the time, but with the added wit and gravitas of Hanks' and Rylance's performances to keep the story from getting too grim, BRIDGE OF SPIES is another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces for Spielberg, especially in his collaborations with Hanks; and it is a film that reminds us that the Cold War, though a part of history now, is also still an important part of that history.",10,3,6,19 October 2015
Knowing," 'Knowing' That You Can't Stop It
","It's interesting to think of the extremes of reactions here to KNOWING, ranging from scorn to almost-uncritical praise. But while I'll admit it isn't the most credible science fiction film I've ever seen, even one of its sub-genre, that of the End Of The World, I know of quite a few others like it that are absolute clinkers.The premise of KNOWING, in that an MIT professor played by Nicolas Cage, has discovered a parchment hidden in a time capsule at his son's school that was buried there fifty years ago with a random set of numbers that foretold of horrors that would befall us between 1959 and 2009, and the ultimate horror that would eliminate the human race, is a brilliant and even frightening one. Indeed, this is a film that involves both science and religion, which often seem to bump into one another both in the reel world and the real world. Cage gets involved because one of the disasters told in that parchment was an apartment fire in Phoenix that killed his wife and eighty others a few years back; and when he comes into contact with the daughter (Rose Byrne) of the disturbed schoolgirl who wrote the parchment, he desperately tries to protect himself, her, and their two children (Chandler Canterbury; Lara Robinson). In the end, however, knowing what the numbers on the parchment mean can only lead to the conclusion that the film gets to eventually--that The End can't be stopped.Although admittedly imperfect, partly because of some occasionally lame dialog, KNOWING really does manage to merit a lot of scares. Its blend of science fiction and Biblical prophecy was, for me, rather interesting, because it did not totally dismiss the prophecy aspect out of hand, and yet it also avoided the ham-fisted soapbox shouting of the 'Left Behind' series. The special effects here, not surprisingly, are quite good, especially the climactic destruction of the world and its rebirth elsewhere in the universe; and the music score by Marco Beltrami interestingly appropriates the ominous Allegretto movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 at a couple of points in the film as a musical prelude to the inevitable.KNOWING probably won't go down as being among the best science fiction films ever, let alone of the End Of The World variety, but it works well enough, and it has provoked a lot of consideration about the impact of science and religion on the future of humanity.",8,2,6,29 March 2009
The Shining," 'Here's Johnny!!'
","What he did for science fiction with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, Stanley Kubrick did for horror with THE SHINING; he made a film that got people talking. Adapting Stephen King's superlative book, though changing it considerably, Kubrick made what I have always believed is one of the best horror films ever.Jack Nicholson is at his maniacal best as Jack Torrence, a failed writer who takes on the job of winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, located high in the Colorado Rockies.  He is advised by the hotel manager (Barry Nelson) that the big requirement for the job is that the person who takes it on should be able to handle five to six months of absolute isolation.  One past caretaker couldn't, and went insane, killing his wife and two daughters with a hatchet, and himself with a shotgun.Nicholson nevertheless takes on the job, and brings his wife (Shelley Duvall) and son (Danny Lloyd) up there with him for company.  But Lloyd, blessed (or cursed) with extrasensory powers (the 'shining'), is acutely aware of the Overlook's inherent evil, embodied in his mind by the ghosts of the two girls, and in Nicholson's ever-crumbling mind by a sinister barman named Lloyd (Joe Turkel).  And once the winter snows shut the Torrence family in, these elements combine with isolation and claustrophobia to turn Nicholson into an axe-wielding maniac.Shot primarily on one vast soundstage in England, THE SHINING has some of the most awesome cinematography and production design ever made for a horror movie.  The camera work (using the Steadicam, one of its first uses ever) is incredible.  Kubrick's choice of music is also very savvy: dissonant works by Bela Bartok, Gyorgy Ligeti, and, most ominously, Krzysztof Penderecki really give the film is epic sense of terror.  And of course, no one can ever forget Nicholson's celebrated 'Here's Johnny!!' during his final rampage.But perhaps the best shot in the film, and one of the pivotal moments in horror history, is of the torrent of blood spilling out of the hotel's elevators in slow motion, punctuated by the avant-garde rumblings of Penderecki's music.  It is one of the best scenes of its type since the shower murder in PSYCHO, and Kubrick should be commended for such a feat.Note to all book-versus-film folks out there: While the film and book versions of THE SHINING differ considerably, the basic structure of the novel is still in place.  I myself liked the book AS A BOOK, and I like the movie AS A MOVIE.  This is why I'd give THE SHINING a '10' rating.",10,0,1,17 July 2001
Dunkirk," Revisiting DUNKIRK
","British director Christopher Nolan is known for being an individualist when it comes to the films he does. Although he is known for doing 'commercial' films like BATMAN BEGINS, THE DARK KNIGHT, and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, many others have seen a more complex side to Mr. Nolan with such psychological thrillers as 2000's MEMENTO; 2002's INSOMNIA; and 2010's INCEPTION, as well as his 2014 science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR (a film to be placed up there with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY). Now, in 2017, he tackles the dark subject of the early part of World War II in DUNKIRK.The film essentially ties five different plot lines into the evacuation of French, Dutch, and British soldiers from the French city of Dunkirk in the late spring of 1940 as the German army is about to sweep in and annihilate them. This includes, among other things, British civilians evacuating as many soldiers as they can on the dangerous English Channel crossing, including one portrayed in usual brilliant low-key style by Mark Rylance. Apart from the appearances of Rylance; Kenneth Branagh as an English commander; and Harry Styles as one of the British soldiers caught up in the horror of this battle, most of the actors are young and anonymous types convincingly portraying average people caught up in an apocalypse that threatens to engulf not only England and Europe, but the entire human race. In an era where linear spectacle is the order of the day, Nolan does just the opposite, intertwining several different strands into one complete film, with a maximum amount of visual spectacle, but also putting this battle into focus in a mere hour and fifty minutes. While Nolan doesn't go into the graphic horror of the opening D-Day invasion of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, he nevertheless makes the tension palpable the entire time.Nolan wisely doesn't explain all that much, which is what any good filmmaker, especially if he has written and directed the film (as is the case here), should do.

Cross of Iron," Peckinpah's Politically Incorrect World War II Opus
","When it came to Sam Peckinpah as a filmmaker, there was never an easy way of doing things, and a penchant for doing nothing the way Hollywood wanted. When he wasn't battling with studio chiefs and producers (which was a great deal of the time), he was frequently battling with critics who liked to nail him for his graphic violence and the complex approach he took to that violence, especially with films like THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS. It earned him the fairly distorting misnomer 'Bloody Sam', which didn't really begin to explain the depth for which he cared about filmic art. And probably no other film of the fourteen he made was quite as infuriating as his 1977 World War II film CROSS OF IRON.Based on the novel of the same name by Willi Heinrich, the film is set along the Eastern Front of World War II, where in 1943 the battle between Stalin's Soviet forces and Hitler's German forces was becoming the personification of a meat grinder war. James Coburn, a Peckinpah favorite, gives another extremely probing performance as Sergeant Rolf Steiner, the leader of a vastly outmanned and outgunned platoon of German foot soldiers, who learns that his particular squad is about to be taken over by the very autocratic Captain Hauptmann Stransky (Maximillian Schell). For reasons that are quite selfish, namely the desire to get the German equivalent of the Purple Heart or Bronze Star, the Iron Cross, Schell forces Coburn to go into battle against a regiment of the Soviet army that literally cuts their platoon to pieces. As is par for the course in a Peckinpah film, we have two men in conflict with one another, both practically two sides of the same German coin, only one of them (Coburn) cares more for the lives of his men, and Schell just cares about getting that damned Iron Cross, and is so blatant about that ambition that he tells Coburn, 'I will show you how a true Prussian fights.' Coburn then retorts, quite rightly, 'Then I will show you where the Iron crosses grow.' It is not too surprising that the battle and action scenes in CROSS OF IRON are distinct from every other filmmaker that has ever lived; we are, after all, talking about Sam Peckinpah here. And he certainly doesn't make things easy; besides the carnage that he shows, he is as precise as ever at showing how the horrors of war affect the men that have to fight it, and how alienated and anesthetized they can be to death and killing on a mass scale we hope never to revisit. Coburn, of course, is brilliant in his role as the humane Steiner whose only concern is for the men he leads and not for the officer corps, especially not the vainglorious Schell (another fine performance). Both actors are supported by a great cast that includes, among others, Senta Berger (who played the love interest in the director's 1965 Civil War western MAJOR DUNDEE), David Warner, and James Mason.Unfortunately, CROSS OF IRON failed to find much of an audience outside of continental Europe because Peckinpah depicted World War II in such a politically incorrect way: from the point-of-view of German foot soldiers, as opposed to Americans and/or Brits, something that clearly seemed to alienate people just wanting to see a standard-issue war film where good guys and bad guys are clearly distinguishable. But that's John Wayne theatrics of the worst kind; and in real war, the line between good and bad is not only a thin one but it's a line that is also frequently crossed. In any case, Coburn, Schell, Mason, Warner, and their fellow German soldiers are frontline soldiers in the heat of battle, not the Nazi commandants who gassed six million Jews with impunity in the concentration camps. They may be wearing the uniform of a country and a leader with a (to say the least) unjust cause, but that by itself doesn't diminish the reality of the horrors they experience, and in that respect it makes them no different from the Americans, the British, or even the Soviets.Helped immensely by a crew that includes the great British cinematographer John Coquillon, who had already worked with Peckinpah on STRAW DOGS and PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID, CROSS OF IRON is one of those films that ranks with the best films about any war ever made, whether it's about World War I (ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT; PATHS OF GLORY), World War II (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), or Vietnam (BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY; PLATOON; FULL METAL JACKET). Even with a few flaws in it, this is a movie that needs to be restored to its full original, and extremely disturbing, glory and power, especially for how it adds to Peckinpah's reputation as an ultimate seeker of the truth of Man's contradictions, no matter how disturbing or politically incorrect he is in doing so.",9,1,2,14 March 2016
Die Hard 2," Die Harder--And More Violently
","The 1988 action thriller DIE HARD was such a huge critical, commercial, and artistic success that it was probably inevitable, given Hollywood's mentality that there is never too much of a good thing, that a sequel would follow.  The result, thus, is DIE HARD 2.Bruce Willis returns as John McClane, who on this Christmas Eve is at Dulles International Airport in Washington awaiting the arrival of his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) from Los Angeles.  Flights, however, are being delayed all across the board into D.C. by one of the biggest blizzards on record.  And when Willis spots Army mercenaries in sensitive areas of the airport where nobody is supposed to go, his cop instincts take hold.  As it turns out, these mercenaries are led by a hard-nosed right-wing colonel (William Sadler) whose aim is to snatch a known Latin-American drug dealer (Franco Nero) from the hands of U.S. justice agents.  Their reason, as Sadler puts it, is because he had 'the guts to stand up against Communist aggression.'  To prove his point, Sadler and his minions shut the entire airport down, putting all those planes in the snowbound skies over the nation's capital in mortal peril, until Nero's military plane arrives.  The result is a battle in more ways than one, as Willis must not only tangle with Sadler's gang, but also with an incompetent airport cop (Dennis Franz) who thinks Willis is a lunatic.Very solid acting from Willis, as well as Fred Dalton Thompson and Art Evans, who portray the two sympathetic airport officials, helps DIE HARD 2 remain leagues ahead of the majority of testosterone-laden action flicks. But many of the same flaws that were in DIE HARD 1 creep up here again.  To paint the airport cops as incompetent buffoons just so that Willis can be the hero of the piece is grossly inaccurate and offensive.  Even the media, in the guise of the ultra-obnoxious Dick Thornberg (William Atherton), gets slammed, and not in a very fair or accurate fashion.  And the violence and language in DIE HARD 2 are far more pervasive than the original, with at least two scenes (the icepick to the eye; and Sadler's ex-commander [John Amos] getting sucked into the engine of the getaway 747 at the end) approaching extreme in terms of bloodshed, and the use of the 'F' word approaching SCARFACE in terms of occasions when it is used.Still, there is plenty of suspense and tension to be had here, with the direction of Renny Harlin evincing, at times, the feel of a Spielberg or Peckinpah at their edge-of-the-seat best.  Michael Kamen's score, which interpolates Jean Sibelius' 'Finlandia' at the end, is also a plus.The verdict is that DIE HARD 2: DIE HARDER is not an unflawed film, but one can certainly do much worse.",7,29,42,2 October 2002
Saving Private Ryan," War is Hell
","I find some of the comments that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is another gung-ho patriotic John Wayne-type propaganda movie just a little bit laughable. This is NOT a John Wayne-type my-country-right-or-wrong tract, and director Steven Spielberg has seen to that.  True, Spielberg never fired a shot in anger--but then neither did the Duke!The whole idea is that war is Hell.  This is true the moment the characters played by Tom Hanks, Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore and others set foot on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944 and encounter massive German resistance in one of the most graphic and violent sequences ever captured on film, one that lasts a good twenty-five minutes.  The film then proceeds on as Hanks and his platoon are assigned to find a Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) who has lost three brothers in other theaters of World War II, and who is believed to have parachuted down behind enemy lines before the D-Day invasion.What Spielberg has done is very much in the tradition of Oliver Stone's PLATOON and Stanley Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, though in an obviously less iconoclastic fashion.  He has shown how war can bring out the best and the worst in the men who have to fight it.  Granted Spielberg's setting is World War II while Stone's and Kubrick's were Vietnam, but the feeling is the same.  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was well-deserving of the Oscars it received, and, like its two Vietnam counterparts, gave me a greater appreciation for what men who must fight these horrible wars, regardless of nationality, go through.  10/10 rating.",Null,1,2,11 July 2001
1941," Plenty of sound and fury...but where are the LAUGHS?!
","At some point, every film maker has his off days.  Steven Spielberg is fortunate enough that he's had only two films like that (the other being HOOK).  But '1941', being made when it was, in the wake of JAWS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, almost destroyed his career.  Having seen this film a number of times, I can see why.This is a high-budget farce about the hysteria that gripped Los Angeles after a Japanese sub was spotted off the coast (which actually happened in February 1942, but the story backdates it to a week after Pearl Harbor).  A lot of great comic actors--Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, John Candy, Tim Matheson, Treat Williams--are on hand here.  Robert Stack delivers a somewhat skewed but faithful impersonation of General Joseph Stilwell.  And three members of Sam Peckinpah's stock company--Warren Oates, Slim Pickens, and Dub Taylor--are also thrown into the mix.But given all this talent and the story's potential, '1941' still falls flat, because for all the sight gags, explosions, and comic mugging, the film rarely delivers on the laughs.  There are moments that are hysterically funny, but those are only MOMENTS.  Part of this has to do with the Bob Gale/Robert Zemeckis screenplay (they would later make the ultra-superior BACK TO THE FUTURE for Spielberg), but much of the blame must be put on Spielberg's shoulders.  Even HE admitted that this film was a mistake, stating once 'Comedy is not my forte.'  And it wasn't.  Critics and audiences hated it, and it's all too easy to see why.  When you've got a lot of sound and fury in a comedy but you neglect to get the audience to laugh constantly (as in AIRPLANE!), all you've got is a lot of sound and fury. John Williams' jaunty martial music may be the best thing about '1941'. Otherwise, this film would be a total waste--and as a longtime fan of Spielberg's, it isn't easy for me to say that.",5,0,1,23 July 2001
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," More terror and suspense with the dinosaurs
","I couldn't disagree more with those who say THE LOST WORLD is an awful movie.  I have seen it many times in the cinema and on video; and for my money, this is a fine continuation of the JURASSIC PARK story.  This time, it is revealed by ambitious billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) that the genetically engineered dinosaurs on Isla Nublar were actually bred on Isla Sorna, situated 87 miles from Nublar.  Thus far, the Isla Sorna dinosaurs have remained in isolation.  But the Isla Nublar disaster has resulted in Attenborough losing control of his InGen corporation to his unscrupulous nephew (Arliss Howard), who wants to bring the dinosaurs back to the as-yet-unfinished Jurassic Park complex in San Diego.The only people standing in his way are chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Goldblum's daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester), his girlfriend (Julianne Moore), and two other men (Richard Schiff, Vince Vaughan).  More terror and suspense ensue as both Goldblum's and Howard's teams come face-to-face with the island's dinosaur populace.  And while Goldblum only loses Schiff from his team and manages to get the rest off the island, Howard still manages to get one T-rex and her infant back to San Diego.  The mayhem continues there.I give this film a 9 rather than the 10 I gave to the original, because not all of the special effects work is exactly as great as before.  But I think those who condemn Spielberg's sequel out of hand are sadly mistaken.  This has enough Hitchcock-style black humor to satisfy; and the sequence of Goldblum and his team trapped in a trailer being overturned and pushed over the cliff by the T-rex is one of the most hair-raising sequences I have ever seen on screen.",9,24,40,30 July 2001
JFK," Crime Of The Century
","The assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas on November 22, 1963 probably ranks as the darkest day in American 20th century history. What makes it particularly sad is that nowhere near all the details about his murder have ever been released to the public.Before Oliver Stone ever came out with 'JFK' the movie, few people believed the Warren Commission's claim that Lee Harvey Oswald acted killed Kennedy on his own volition.  There was also a good case to be made that Oswald was nothing more than a patsy in a very devious conspiracy, and that he didn't even do it.  Note that all of this was BEFORE the release of 'JFK.'  The firestorm of controversy the film created only served to add to the debate.Stone's epic, 205-minute movie, which details the efforts of New Orleans DA Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) to unravel at least a part of the conspiracy by trying to tie in local business magnate Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones) to it, levels some pretty heavy judgments against those who would cling to the Oswald-did-it-alone-theory.  Not all of the theories that Stone espouses here are believable, but a number of scenarios are raised that could very easily have happened in reality.  Was JFK's murder possibly even an elaborate coup d'etat, a theory raised by Mr. X (Donald Sutherland)?  Was Kennedy actually trying to end the Cold War while in office, putting the military/industrial complex in fear for its very existence?  Would he have halted America's involvement in Vietnam?All the questions and theories get a thorough going-over.  Nobody's going to mistake 'JFK' for a documentary, to be sure.  And certainly there will always be apologists for the Warren Commission, like Gerald Posner, even as its theories have credibility holes big enough to drive a truck through. But in the end, 'JFK' is riveting filmmaking pure and simple, well worthy of the Oscars it got for cinematography and editing.  And get a load of the people Stone put into his film: Jack Lemmon, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, Sally Kirkland, Walter Matthau, Kevin Bacon, Ed Asner.With all of this, Stone, like Stanley Kubrick, made a film that started people talking...and one that they're STILL talking about after ten years. RATING: 8/10.",9,1,12,9 July 2001
2012," Doomsday, Roland Emmerich Style
","The same director responsible for previous mega budget extravaganzas as 10,000 B.C., INDEPRENDENCE DAY, GODZILLA, and the often-maligned DAY AFTER TOMORROW is at it again. This time, Roland Emmerich destroys the world with a specific date in '2012.' The whole premise of the film is based around the ancient Mayan calendar, which predicts the date of December 21, 2012 as signaling a profound change in our globe. Of course, this gives rise to all manner of speculation and debate among scientists and theologians alike. But in this film's case, it involves a severe solar storm somehow affecting our planet's geological plates to the ultimate extreme, and the arks that are being built to house as much of what will be left of humanity as possible. Among those caught up in the calamity, and those the audience can feel some empathy for while the world is being swallowed up whole, are a failed sci-fi author (John Cusack) and his family, and the geophysicist (Chiwetei Ejiofor) who saw this Apocalypse coming in 2009. In the meantime, during the 156-minute running time of '2012', save for a typically Hollywood nut job role for Woody Harrelson (as a Manson-inspired conspiracy theorist), we are witness to every disaster possible in reality, and possible only because of the special effects.As his filmography shows, Emmerich is more in the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay school of super destruction than the more refined nuances of a Spielberg or a Kubrick, so nobody should go in with any grand illusions that '2012' is another '2001.' It certainly doesn't have the poignancy of the earlier 2009 doomsday drama KNOWING. Still, the performances by Cusack, Amanda Peet (as his wife), Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, Danny Glover (as the last U.S. president), Thandie Newton, and, in a minor cameo, George Segal are at least enough to cover the frequent lapses in its credibility.In every sense of the word, '2012' is as insane a film as has been made in Hollywood in a very long while, and that's saying a lot. It's certainly not a masterpiece in the traditional sense. But in terms of extreme spectacle and CGI genius...well, it might as well be.",7,1,2,16 November 2009
Schindler's List," One of the most important films of modern times
","Some events in human history are of such a magnitude that no single film made anywhere, least of all Hollywood, can ever do them complete justice. But in 1993 Steven Spielberg put all his heart and soul into a film about the greatest injustice that Man has ever foisted upon his fellow man--the Holocaust.  SCHINDLER'S LIST is the result.This epic movie, shot in a somber, documentary-style black-and-white, focuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a savvy Nazi businessman who had opened an enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland after the Nazis basically overran it.  Schindler was every bit the womanizer and con man, and initially he saw the Jewish people of the Krakow ghetto as potential slave labor, nothing more.  But when it became rather clear to him what his fellow Nazis were doing to the Jews, he began to use his powers of persuasion to shield his workers and their families.  In doing so, he somehow managed to save twelve hundred lives from extinction.Spielberg clearly does not gloss over Schindler's gamier side, though he may be accused of romanticizing it.  But he also does not spare us the horrible fact of the Nazis wiping out at least six million people because they were Jews, and perhaps three times as many more of other 'inferior' peoples. Ralph Fiennes is about as chilling a villain as there could possibly be, since he's portraying the notorious Auschwitz death guard Amon Goeth.  This is a film about pain, death, and murder on a scale never before seen in human history (and, if we're lucky, which will never been seen again).  But it is also about redemption.  Oskar Schindler was no saint; and for each life he saved, at least 5000 more died.  But he did as much as he possibly could, and went broke doing it.  For that, there is a place in heaven for him.Winner of seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Director (which Spielberg clearly deserved long before this), SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of the most important films of modern times, a monumental statement against hatred from a master of the cinema.",10,9,26,31 July 2001
I Am Legend," Three Times A 'Legend'
","Richard Matheson's 1954 novel 'I Am Legend' is universally considered a touchstone in modern horror and science fiction literature. Its story of the last known living man on Earth trying to survive an onslaught of mutants bought on by a terrible plague has been the stuff of many cinematic variations (including NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD), plus two loose adaptations--1964's THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with Vincent Price); and 1971's THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston). And in our time, it is now Will Smith who has the burden of being that Last Man in this third version of 'I Am Legend', using the novel's title this time around.Smith takes up the role of Robert Neville, who had been a virologist in 2009, trying to contain a once-promising cure for cancer that instead became a violent plague and killed off practically the entire Earth's population. Now, in the year 2012, he roams around New York City (the novel has this set in Los Angeles), foraging for supplies during the day with his German shepherd Samantha, trying to contact anyone who might still be alive, and making it back to his townhouse before dark--because that's when other survivors come out, and they are the Infected, or 'Dark Seekers.' His main business is to try and find an antidote for the virus, which is the only way he keeps sane. And then his world takes a turn when an uninfected survivor (Alice Braga) finds him, and he sees some ray of hope.As with the previous two films based on Matheson's novel, I AM LEGEND does follow certain aspects of its source material: a plague killing off the population; flashbacks to the start of the horror; mutant survivors hounding for Smith's blood; and the appearance of uninfected people in Neville's world. On other points, unsurprisingly, this version of 'I Am Legend' really isn't any closer to its source than the other two were. In one sense, this version, directed by Francis Lawrence and scripted by Mark Protosevitch and Akiva Goldsman, reworks aspects of the John and Joyce Corrington script of THE OMEGA MAN in making Smith a scientist trying desperately to find a cure while maintaining his sanity in the same way Heston had done in that film.Obviously, die-hard fanatics of Matheson's claustrophobic and brilliant novel are not going to have warm and fuzzy feelings by the way I AM LEGEND has been amped up, even in contrast to the '71 version (let alone the Poverty-Row '64 LAST MAN ON EARTH). But Smith's performance, as he's on screen for better than three-fourths of the time, is every bit as credible (if in different ways) as Price's and Heston's in the earlier versions; and the sense of desolation in New York City creates a great deal of tension.It may be that Matheson's book, with posited the vampire myth in scientific terms, can't really be filmed the way it should by Hollywood; these days, vampires seem to be the stuff of B-movies. That said, however, this I AM LEGEND does work well enough just the same.",8,3,7,16 December 2007
The Longest Day," THE LONGEST DAY--A Review In Salute To Veterans Day (November 11, 2011)
","What is there to say about 20th Century Fox and its legendary and cantankerous studio chief Darryl Zanuck's monstrous 1962 World War II epic THE LONGEST DAY that hasn't already been said? Taken from Cornelius Ryan's excellent book of the same name (with Ryan and various others working on the screenplay) about the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, an invasion officially known as Operation Overlord, THE LONGEST DAY shows how numerous elements of planning and chance helped bring about the single biggest military campaign in history, one that led to the eventual end of Hitler's Third Reich. And for this, Zanuck had assembled a massive crew in which three directors (the legendary Andrew Marton for the U.S.; Ken Annakin for the Brits; and Bernhard Wicki for the Germans), special effects men, and a huge cast of Hollywood stars put themselves in service of this epic true story.While certain elements are inevitably fictionalized, notably elements of the landing itself (which, as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN's opening sequence shows, wasn't a cakewalk by any stretch of the imagination), the film does capture the behind-the-scenes planning amongst the top men and officers on both sides of the conflict, including the Germans, whose soldiers are seen accurately in this film as basic foot soldiers just doing their job, and not the goose-stepping Nazi goons in Berlin who sent twenty million people, including plenty of their own, to their deaths. At three hours, this still may be a lot for people to take in, even if their attention spans haven't been warped by the sound and fury of war movies past and present. On the other hand, if the length of the film is a bit much, and the film itself is old-fashioned by today's standards, there is always that unbelievable gathering of Hollywood heavyweights to keep one's attention focused: John Wayne (who, ironically, never served in World War II), Henry Fonda, Robert Mitchum, Rod Steiger, Robert Wagner, Edmond O'Brien, Robert Ryan, Sean Connery (just as he ascended to stardom as James Bond), Roddy McDowall, Red Buttons, Peter Lawford, Richard Beymer, Paul Anka, Fabian, Richard Burton, Richard Todd, and tons of others. All of this was done at what was then considered an exorbitant cost of $10 million (though Fox had poured $40 million into CLEOPATRA at the same time, and almost went bankrupt doing so), and it became one of the biggest moneymakers of its day, as well as the most commercially successful black-and-white film until Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST.Unlike a lot of war films of its time, THE LONGEST DAY, while stirring and stunning, doesn't make any heavy pretenses or apologies towards patriotism, because it was understood that Operation Overlord was an absolute necessity in order to save Europe and the world at large; as such, the gravity of the situation was enough to unite everybody. Those men who fought that day, regardless of their nationalities, are to be saluted for their courage and bravery; and even though it may have been surpassed by SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE LONGEST DAY still remains one of Hollywood's great war films, one to be remembered for many more decades to come.",10,2,2,11 November 2011
The Longest Day," Revisiting June 6, 1944
","There are just some dates in history that will live forever. July 20, 1969 was one of those days, when Man set foot on the Moon for the first time. November 22, 1963 was another such day, when America lost its innocence as the result of John F. Kennedy being murdered.Another important date in world history would be June 6, 1944. On that day, with the world still writhing in pain from a horrible war, an invasion force of three million soldiers from the U.S., England, and Canada stormed the beaches of France's Normandy coastline to start the freeing of Europe from Adolf Hitler's Nazi tyranny, which by that time had killed well over fifteen million people overall (six million of those for the specific reason of them being Jewish). The operation was known as 'Operation Overlord'; and the date itself became known as D-Day. But for those millions who stormed those beaches, and the tens of thousands of them who were to lose their lives in this great cause, it was THE LONGEST DAY. And eighteen years later, in 1962, the combined talents of 20th Century Fox mogul Darryl Zanuck, writer Cornelius Ryan, and tons of others memorialized that day on the big screen in one of the greatest Hollywood epics ever made.This nearly three-hour masterpiece doesn't just focus on the complexities of the D-Day landing itself; it also gives us a look at the men who had to fight it, and the Nazi commandants who were in charge of repelling the invasion (and who evidently slept at the switch, not thinking that such an invasion could ever be mounted). THE LONGEST DAY was the most expensive black-and-white movie ever made in Hollywood up to that point, at nearly $10 million; and in order to make this happen, Zanuck got practically every living actor in Hollywood, and some more from England, to participate. This meant that many of the actors were only on the screen for a short time; and it also meant that some were in roles that they arguably were a bit too old to be playing. Still, the presence of these actors and their star wattage made THE LONGEST DAY, among other things, The Biggest Deal. When you have a cast that includes John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Henry Fonda, Rod Steiger, Robert Ryan, Edmond O'Brien, Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Wagner, and Eddie Albert just for starters, then it definitely is a big deal.Of course, it is tempting for people to compare this film's depiction of the D-Day landing to the way it was depicted in, but was the opening salvo to, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. But such comparisons, while inevitable, are not necessarily fair or accurate. What was shown in unflinchingly graphic detail by Steven Spielberg in his 1998 masterpiece could not be shown in pre-MPAA ratings Hollywood. One can't hold this against either Zanuck, or the three directors (Andrew Marton; Ken Annakin; Bernhard Wicki) who helped bring THE LONGEST DAY to the screen. In the end, THE LONGEST DAY still gives one a feel of the scope of the way the invasion took place, and some of the foibles that occurred on and prior to June 6, 1944. The fact is that D-Day, while an enormous success for the Allies in the end, wasn't perfect at its inception, which was certainly shown to be so in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and acknowledged here.Still, the invasion was given its full measure of due here in THE LONGEST DAY; and that's why it remains indisputably one of the greatest films about the absolute last 'Good War' in history.",10,0,2,12 November 2019
Slap Shot," Puck You!
","What DOCTOR STRANGELOVE did for Cold War politics and nuclear war, and NETWORK did for television news, the 1977 film SLAP SHOT does for ice hockey: It skewers the sport in a way that is so scatological and blackly funny. And moreover, it got us to see and hear Paul Newman in a way that we had never heard him before.Under the assured direction of George Roy Hill, who directed Newman (and Robert Redford) in two incredible box offices smashes (1969's BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID; 1973's THE STING), and a truly explosive, four-letter-word-ridden screenplay by Nancy Dowd, SLAP SHOT stars Newman as the coach of the Charlestown Chiefs, a once-proud minor-league franchise that has fallen on a lot of hard times...as in, they haven't had a winning season in ages! Worst of all, the steel mill in town is getting ready to shutter its gates forever, leaving the few fans left in Charlestown without jobs, and hence without enough money to get to see a franchise that continues on the downhill slide towards obsolescence.But then the Chiefs' general manager, played by the inimitable Strother Martin, concocts a scheme that pays off dividends: He hires three brothers, the infamous Hanson Brothers (Jeff Carlson; Steve Carlson; Dave Hanson) who, how shall we put this, have a far different idea of how hockey should be played. It is with fists, brutality, and a bit of blood being spilled. Newman has already gotten into part of the act by baiting the opposing teams' players and coaches with all manner of imprecations, but the presence of the Hansons just ups the energy even more. The Chiefs suddenly become the toast of the Federal Hockey League and their hometown fans, especially when Newman, over the radio, offers a $100 bounty to knock the living stuffing out of the Syracuse coach during a game. But as it turns out, everything isn't quite what it seems....Even after having played some fairly non-conformist characters like HUD and COOL HAND LUKE, it isn't likely that audiences had ever seen anything what they saw in Newman in his role here as Reggie Dunlop. The man literally swears like a Marine in this film; and the stuff he says had to have been considered outrageous for the late 1970s. After films like SCARFACE, FULL METAL JACKET, and practically any Quentin Tarantino film you can name upped the four-letter-word quotient into the hundreds, it probably seems less so. But since it was a woman who wrote the screenplay, it's still a bit hard for some to take. The scenes of hockey violence, though far less gratuitous than what was to come, are still fairly savage, given that they are often spiked with the scatologoical language and humor, though the 'strip tease' thing at the end, done by the one Chiefs player (Michael Ontkean) who mostly refuses to indulge in the blood and guts aspect of the thing, does 'lighten' the mood up, so to speak.With some solid supporting turns by folks like Melinda Dillon, Lindsay Crouse, M. Emmett Walsh, Swoosie Kurtz, and Jennifer Warren, SLAP SHOT remains easily one of the most jaw-droppingly funny black comedies of all times. Just don't let the under-age set watch it unaccompanied.",10,1,1,18 March 2020
Ex Machina," Dark Psychological Thriller About Artificial Intelligence
","The history of computers and artificial intelligence seems like it's been a short and at a light-speed pace; but in truth, it has its beginnings in the development of ENIAC, the first so-called 'electronic brain' in the years following World War II. At that time, of course, such machines, consisting of vacuum tubes, could take up whole buildings. By the late 1960s, however, their size had been reduced to taking up mere single rooms; and in our day and age, that technology can fit onto one's arm or onto one's ear. And it won't be long before the kind of artificial intelligence that legendary sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke (of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY fame) talked about, where one wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a human voice and that of an artificial intelligence, will be possible. But as with any technology created by Man, the idea of artificial intelligence can have its dangerous drawbacks. That idea was explored in '2001' by Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick, and expanded upon in 2001 (ironically enough) by Steven Spielberg in A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. And in 2014, Alex Garland, who had written the screenplays of such films as 28 DAYS LATER and SUNSHINE, made his directing debut (again, also writing the screenplay) with a new study in artificial intelligence entitled EX MACHINA.In EX MACHINA, Domhnall Gleeson plays a computer programmer who ahs 'won' a contest to spend a week at the isolated retreat of his company's CEO (Oscar Isaac). But it's not like any 'vacation' that Gleeson has ever been involved with. Indeed, it's not a vacation at all, period. Gleeson will be put under isolation for a week (the most ironclad non-disclosure agreement, as it were, in modern history) as part of a study being conducted by Isaac on human interaction with artificial intelligence; and in this case, Gleeson will be studied in his interactions with one of Isaac's 'cyborgs', Ava (Alicia Virklander). The test, known as the Turing Test (named after the English computer scientist Alan Turing) is to find out whether Gleeson can detect 'real' feelings in Ava, who after all is an artificially created being. But Gleeson gets a little taste of confusion when Virklander, during each of the seven tests, automatically turns off the power in Isaac's mansion, and warns him that all is not what it seems in Isaac's 'experiment'. And indeed it isn't long before Gleeson finds out that his boss/mentor is in the business of basically 'reprogramming' artificial intelligence, which pretty much would amount to the technological equivalent of homicide. Very soon, Gleeson's wonder at Virklander, whom he believes has achieved actual human consciousness, has morphed into a kind of paranoia that Isaac is now a genius of the most dangerous kind, a kind of 21st century Doctor Frankenstein of the world of artificial intelligence and cyborgs.What is unique about EX MACHINA is that, while the technology and the special effects are seamless, Garland didn't exactly have a budget in the hundred million dollar range to fool around with in making it. Indeed, with only minor location shooting in Norway and the rest at Pinewood Studios in London, Garland made EX MACHINA for a ridiculously low $15 million, just $2.5 million more than what Kubrick expended on '2001' back in the late 1960s. And while EX MACHINA may not have ambitions or the scope of '2001' (something that Garland himself admitted very much in interviews, even going so far as to say that his film didn't go as high on the intelligence scale as Kubrick's had), it nevertheless has a lot more substance to it than most other films that are priced at five to ten times the budget Garland worked with. Gleeson and Isaac work quite well, sparring with one another over the issue of Virklander's 'humanity'; and Virklander herself makes for an extremely appealing cyborg. The design of Isaac's mansion is also quite scary at times as well, mirroring the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's 1980 horror classic THE SHINING.While the sex and language are a little bit much at times, and there is one brief but slightly graphic display of bloodshed, as Gleeson 'tears' his own skin apart, perhaps to see if he himself has become a cyborg as part of Isaac's weird 'experiment', EX MACHINA wisely sticks to the parameters about computer technology and artificial intelligence that were so daftly explored not only in '2001' and A.I., but also in past films as diverse as 1970's COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT; 1973's WESTWORLD; and the 1982 Ridley Scott classic BLADE RUNNER. EX MACHINA won the 2015 Oscar for Best Visual Effects, as they were very important in Garland's ability to create a real world out of man-made technology. Fortunately, he had also remembered to include the human element in the forms of Gleeson and Virklander; and those two, as much as the visuals make EX MACHINA a solid sci-fi/psychological thriller.EX MACHINA will get an '8' rating from me.",8,1,2,12 May 2018
Hidden Figures," African-American Women Making A Difference At The Dawn Of The Space Age
","One would think that NASA would be a government institution that would be immune from the social upheavals of the early 1960s. But in that period of time, three distinguished African American women from Hampton, Virginia named Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughn, and Mary Jackson, all of whom were incredible geniuses at crunching complex math problems, did indeed shake things up there, fighting not only institutionalized racism but also a touch of misogyny as well. At the same time, it was what these three women did that helped America's manned space program take flight by 1962, and set us on a course towards the Apollo 11 manned landing on the Moon in 1969. Their story is brilliantly told in the film HIDDEN FIGURES, based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Sheterly.Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janaelle Monae portray, respectively, Johnson, Vaughn, and Jackson, three women who, as young girls in a much more ultra-segregated South of the mid-1920s, displayed such an extreme aptitude for complex algebra and calculus that got them jobs at NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia in 1961. Being incredibly quick at complex math problems that are involved in getting the space program in a position where it could challenge the achievements of the Soviet Union, however, doesn't count for much when they are still made painfully aware of their 'place' (separate bathrooms and coffee pots) in a profession that, though becoming a technological juggernaut, is still stuck in an unsavory past. This is what they face from co-workers like those portrayed by Kirstin Dunst and Jim Parsons, though Kevin Costner (portraying NASA station chief Al Harrison) is duly impressed with their skill in calculating all the complexities of launches, orbits, and splashdown angles. The work of the three women takes on added urgency when, on April 17, 1961, Yuri Gagarin becomes the first human being to venture beyond Earth's atmosphere, putting the Soviets well ahead of America, while NASA's Atlas and Redstone rockets either keep going off course or blowing up on the launch pad. For Costner, this means that their work is essential, because he himself must take a lot of the heat from the powers-that-be in Washington for the enormous expenditures that NASA is incurring in such a risky proposition.The moment of truth comes on February 20, 1962 when, through Henson's lightning calculations, astronaut John Glenn is launched into space in the Friendship 7 space capsule. He manages to get through three orbits; but then, he and the ground crew receive indications that his heat shield may fail upon re-entry. Once more, Henson is put in charge of coming up with a quick solution to hopefully stop Glenn from burning up in the atmosphere, while the entire world holds its collective breath.What HIDDEN FIGURES tells is a story that only a handful of Americans, if any at all, have ever known about because of all the political and social tumult that went on during the 1960s. Henson, Spencer, and Monae have the tough jobs of portraying the three women's personality quirks, while trying gamely to hide their rage at being so slowly accepted by the white and (with the exception of Dunst) male NASA hierarchy because of being African-American women with sky-high IQ's. They give incredible performances in their roles, as does Costner in what, for any other actor, would seem to be a relatively minor role of the NASA director who is oblivious to his workplace's antiquated caste system until it interferes with America's ability to catch up with the Soviets.Theodore Melfi, who directed the quirky 2014 comedy drama ST. VINCENT, handles the proceedings quite well, getting solid performances from his cast, including Parsons (best known as the head 'geek' on TV's 'The Big Bang Theory'); and the film does a good idea at not only taking a pointed look at institutionalized racism, but also mocking it (especially in the ironic and funny opening sequence of an old white Virginia state trooper escorting the three women to Langley a few minutes in). HIDDEN FIGURES is not only a great film for its true-life story, but also a reminder of how much African Americans have always contributed to the greatness of our nation, a fact we still need to be reminded about in the 21st century.",10,3,10,22 February 2017
1917," '1917': An Extremely Honorable Look At The Horror That Was World War I
","It was the assassination of the Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand at the hands of Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 that set off World War I. When all was said and done, four years and six and a half months later, on November 11, 1918, as many as fifteen million people, civilians and soldiers alike lay dead on the continent of Europe.It remains one of the most misunderstood conflicts in human history's sadly long (and getting longer by the minute) series of wars. But it's a war that hasn't necessarily gotten as much attention from Hollywood as, say, World War II, Vietnam, or the wars America has fought since September 11, 2001. The best films about what Woodrow Wilson once called 'The War To End All Wars' have been Lewis Milestone's 1930 classic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, and Stanley Kubrick's 1957 magnum opus PATHS OF GLORY. One can now add director Sam Mendes' '1917' to that rather short list.In this movie, shot in one huge long flowing take lasting 119 minutes or so, young British actors Drew-Charles Chapman and George MacKay portray two British soldiers assigned to what could best be called a suicide mission. They have to deliver a message to a British force deep inside enemy territory to call off an attack against a supposedly retreating German battalion, which their commanders have labeled to be a deadly trap. Indeed, this deadly trap, if the Brits fall into it, will result in the loss of 1600 soldiers, including Chapman's own brother (Richard Madden). And in that time, a bond of brotherhood will develop between these two soldiers as they make their long trek across a wide swath of no-man's land, full of body-filled trenches, tripwires, German snipers, and all other manner of the horrors of war the likes of which humanity had never seen before.Mendes, whose directing credits prior to '1917' included the 1999 Oscar-winning AMERICAN BEAUTY, 2002's ROAD TO PERDITION, and the 2012 James Bond offering SKYFALL, both directed and co-scripted '1917', inspired by the stories his grandfather told him about this brutal part of human history, a war that proved most devastating to Mendes' native England, not only in the numbers of Brits who were killed, but also in the manner in which more than a few of them died; this was the first known instance, and by no means the last, of chemical weapons being used in military conflict. And while Mendes' film does not feature any uses of chemical weaponry like mustard gas in its story, the director nevertheless shows a great deal of the brutality and inhumanity of this war, and how Chapman and MacKay keep their humanity about them in a situation in which bloody death is a constant thing. That he was able to do this in one long single take from start to finish is indeed an incredible achievement; it is a technical marvel. But Chapman's and MacKay's performances as the young soldiers offer up the importance of how innocence is always the first thing that gets destroyed in war, helping make '1917' a masterpiece that goes beyond just the 'one-take' technical brilliance.Mendes is particularly good in the opening section of the film, creating the long flowing shots in the trenches, ones that are, whether wittingly or not, a nod to what Kubrick had done with brilliance in PATHS OF GLORY; and the avant-garde score by Thomas Newman (AMERICAN BEAUTY; BRIDGE OF SPIES) captures both the horror and the humanity of the situation at hand. While Colin Firth and Benedict Cumberbatch, both great actors on their own, do have roles in here, the focus remains on Chapman and MacKay throughout, ensuring that '1917' does for World War I what both ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and PATHS OF GLORY had done before it: find a spark of decency in one of humanity's darkest times.",10,5,8,13 January 2020
Lincoln," Spielberg On Honest Abe
","Given the difficulties of America in the 21st century, it is oftentimes difficult to remember that America has faced much more challenging and much more tragic circumstances throughout its history. The biggest challenge America ever faced was not a war for freedom in some faraway part of the world, but a war for freedom on its own soil. The Civil War, in which Southern states split off from the rest of the Union over the issue of whether African-Americans should remain enslaved, tore America apart between 1861 and 1865; and only one man was able to settle the issue. That man was Abraham Lincoln, our nation's 16th president. The last three months of Lincoln's life, in which he managed to accomplish so much only to have it end in his assassination, is what is detailed in LINCOLN, director Steven Spielberg's impassioned and highly involved American epic.Stepping into the shoes of 'Honest Abe' is English actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who essays a Lincoln not as we thought we knew him, with a stentorian manner of speaking, but a high, reedy-voiced man reflecting his origins in Kentucky and Illinois whose word nevertheless carried considerable gravitas, even as he presided over the messiest conflict America would ever see. Not only does Day-Lewis preside over the immense task, after having won a second term in office, of trying to end that conflict, but also to resolve once and for all the issue of slavery by the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. Making things worse for Day-Lewis, even members of his own cabinet, including Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn), are torn on the issue of compromise with ending the Civil War and passing the amendment with the required two-thirds majority needed in the House of Representatives. The task for Lincoln thus falls in no small measure on two prominent Northern politicians, Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) and Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), to not only keep his Republican majority in line, but also to cause twenty Democrats to defect from the hard line of keeping slavery in place, come hell or high water. The debate in the House, particularly with Jones commanding so much attention, is as bitter and rancorous as any we've seen in our modern era; and the final vote is 119-56 (with eight abstentions, it is just enough to allow the 13th Amendment to pass). In the end, Day-Lewis visits many of the Civil War battle sites and reflects, in the days before his violent demise, the cost of war and the battle of ideals.Spielberg had handled great American historical issues and eras before in such films as THE COLOR PURPLE, AMISTAD, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but LINCOLN was clearly a personal obsession for him; indeed, this project was twelve years in the making. And while he may not have been that much of a history buff either in grade school, high school, or while briefly a student at Long Beach State in the late 1960s, he nevertheless developed a taste for it throughout his career. The impact of the Holocaust as shown in SCHINDLER'S LIST is what almost certainly fired his imagination, to understand the why of that tragedy; and in LINCOLN, he does very much the same thing, in illustrating why Lincoln was so important to America, not only of his time, but of all time, leading up to the 2008 election of our nation's first African-American president. And here, he allows Day-Lewis to give a portrait of Lincoln that rates right up there with Henry Fonda's portrayal in John Ford's 1938 film YOUNG MR. LINCOLN, and Gregory Peck's in the epic 1982 TV miniseries THE BLUE AND THE GRAY. Sally Field is also superlative as his wife Mary Lincoln; and Holbrook and Jones, seasoned veterans both, are excellent as the men fighting the good fight.The usual excellent score by John Williams (with some period music thrown in) and the cinematography by Spielberg's usual DP Janusz Kaminski, along with the performances, make this 149 minute-long epic extremely breathless; and Tony Kushner's fine screenplay, based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book 'A Team Of Rivals', gives the cast and Spielberg plenty to work with. As LINCOLN proves once again, Spielberg is a director capable of bringing the most difficult subject matter to dramatic life and understanding more about ourselves as human beings and as a nation at large. Great filmmaking does that, and, without question, LINCOLN is an example of great filmmaking; and I would rank it as the single best film of 2012.",10,4,9,19 November 2012
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," TV's First Battle Royale: Murrow Vs. McCarthy
","Of all the embarrassments in American history, few can compare in magnitude to the witch hunt conducted in the early 1950s against real and alleged Communists by Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin. But there was at least one man who was willing to use the powers he had to call McCarthy's bluff on the issue, and do so on an embryonic medium called the television. That man was legendary CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow, and that televised battle royale between him and McCarthy is the subject of GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK, directed and co-written by George Clooney (who portrays CBS news director Fred Friendly) and so titled after Murrow's celebrated closing line at the end of his newscasts.David Straithairn does a superlative job of portraying Murrow, who, while realizing that his actions might very well jeopardize him, his colleagues and the entire CBS television network, nevertheless could not just stand idly by and see a demagogue like McCarthy persecute those he merely suspected of 'being Red' without a shred of evidence to back up those claims. Television was still a relative novelty when these events took place in 1953 and 1954, and because of this, the battle between the uncompromising newsman and the equally uncompromising junior senator from Wisconsin was one that helped make television news into an institution, and the first example of television's ability to influence the minds and opinions of people on matters of vital importance. GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK also shows how, even early on, the line between corporate profits and social values was one that needed to be trod with care, especially in the sometimes heated discussions Straithairn has with CBS chairman William Paley, played to brilliance by Frank Langella. In a very wise move on Clooney's part, he filmed this movie in glorious black-and-white and recreated the look of CBS News during the 1950s in such a way that one gets a true sense of the period. Straithairn accurately captures Murrow's clipped speech tones while reporting the news and commenting on McCarthy's heated Commie fishing expeditions. The ensemble casting is rounded out by folks like Patricia Clarkson, Jeff Daniels, and Robert Downey Jr.Though set in the early years of television, the story of GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK still seems hugely relevant today; and it is for that reason, plus the fact that his father Nick was a highly respected TV newsman in Cincinnati, that Clooney took this project on. Murrow was not afraid to hit hard at what he saw were wrongs being committed by such a tyrant as McCarthy--a kind of bravery that newsmen of today could learn from when dealing with those who say that to question the veracity and the truthfulness of the U.S. government with respect to the war in Iraq is somehow 'treasonous' and 'unpatriotic', and somehow 'gives aid and comfort to the enemy.' Unsurprisingly, this is the mark of liberal Hollywood film-making (and Clooney himself is an unabashed liberal), but then so be it. As a look behind a defining moment in American history, especially with respect to television news, GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK is a great singular achievement. It is also an example of the kind great, hard-hitting, issue-oriented film-making that Hollywood was so great at during the 1960s and 1970s--a trait that has only been reawakened the last few years with the Iraq war and post-9/11 paranoia. In short, this is by any stretch of the imagination a must-see movie.",10,1,2,31 March 2006
Jurassic World," Fourth Time Out With The Dinosaurs...And So Much More
","Michael Crichton, who passed away in the fall of 2008, may not have realized the kind of goldmine he struck when he published his dinosaur novel 'Jurassic Park' in 1990; but with director Steven Spielberg's help, that goldmine was open for business with the original 1993 film version, and then with its 1997 sequel THE LOST WORLD. Due to Spielberg being heavily involved in making A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE in 2001, the third 'Jurassic Park' film was left in the hands of director Joe Johnston, with Spielberg staying on as executive producer. Incredibly enough, another fourteen years would pass until the move-going public got the fourth in the series, JURASSIC WORLD.Twenty-two years after John Hammond's experiment at producing an innovative theme part with genetically-created dinosaurs on an island some 200 miles off of Costa Rica came crashing down with the dinosaurs consuming several people, now that same island, Isla Nublar, is now home to Jurassic World, a highly innovative theme park with bigger and better dinosaurs, and, hopefully, with greater controls. One of the workers, an ex-Navy seaman (Chris Pratt), has become especially attuned to a number of the raptors in the park, and has managed to earn their trust. At the same time, the park's principal supervisor (Bryce Dallas Howard) has been overseeing the creation of a super-dinosaur, made up of the DNA of the previous species of dinosaurs, including velociraptors, and tyrannosaurus rexes, that has guaranteed an up tick in revenue and park attendance. But as with anything involving the technology used in creating creatures that have been extinct from the Earth's surface for sixty-five million years, soon everything turns upside down. This doesn't stop the park's main security chief (Vincent D'Onofrio) from seeing a way to use these dinosaurs as a weapon of war, over the vehement objections of both Pratt and Howard, as well as one of the original scientists (B.D. Wong) from the original Jurassic Park. Upping the ante still further are the fact that Howard's two nephews (Nick Robinson; Ty Simpkins) have come to the island to be with their aunt; instead, they find themselves having to behave like responsible adults in the most horrible way possible when the mayhem created by the 'super-dinosaur' allows all the other species out of their enclosures. When D'Onofrio's megalomaniacal ambitions result in his death, it is up to Pratt and Howard to destroy the super dinosaur with all the weapons at their disposal.As with JURASSIC PARK III, Spielberg's involvement in directing another film (in this case the World War II spy thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES) led him to taking the role of executive producer, allowing Colin Treverrow, whose only feature film credit before this was the romantic comedy drama SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED in 2012, to direct it. With help from co-writers Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, and Derek Connally, however, Treverrow managed to cobble together elements of the first three films into a coherent, if not necessarily letter-perfect, science fiction/suspense thriller that, in some interesting twists, pays homage not only two its three predecessors, but also to Spielberg's 1975 classic JAWS (as the super-dinosaur eats a Great White shark to the amazement of the 20,000+ people in attendance), and to Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 horror classic THE BIRDS (as the avian dinosaurs attack the park visitors from the air with sometimes bloody results).It is not a mark against either the film or Treverrow to say that the film misses the verve and panache of the first two movies that were directed by Spielberg in masterful fashion, though one sometimes wishes he had concentrated as much on characters as he did on the mayhem. Nevertheless, Pratt (ZERO DARK THIRTY; GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) and Howard (LADY IN THE WATER) do really good turns as a pair, despite the rather clichéd bickering they do at the start; and Robinson and Simpkins make for as appealing a pair of kids as Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards did in Spielberg's original. Giacchino's score is impressive as well, and he wisely interpolates John Williams' themes from Spielberg's first two films while also incorporating some of his own ideas.The final verdict when it comes to JURASSIC WORLD is that, despite its tendency to fall into predictability in terms of the dinosaur attacks and some cardboard characters, it is far better than most summer CGI film fare, with enough Spielberg influence to keep it from being just another blockbuster, resulting in my giving it an '8' rating.",8,9,29,20 June 2015
World Trade Center," Hollywood Deals With 9/11 On Realistic And Human Terms
","It is unlikely that any film, documentary or otherwise, can depict the horrors of September 11, 2001 with the same kind of accuracy as those who were direct witness to the nightmare. But this year, Hollywood has shown a willingness to tackle 9/11 from a deeply human perspective, first through the TV film FLIGHT 93, then Paul Greengrass' excellent feature film UNITED 93, and now through director Oliver Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER.Stone, a native New Yorker, but also a polarizing figure of the cinema via his dark and controversial explorations of recent U.S. history and politics (PLATOON; JFK, etc.), has sought to focus on the true meaning of heroism by focusing in on Port Authority officers John McLoughlin and William Jimeno, who, along with their fellow Port Authority and NYC fire and police personnel, went into the World Trade Center towers to evacuate as many people as possible from there after the two jets were rammed into the buildings. The two men, however, nearly became a part of history right then and there when the towers crumbled. For twenty hours, both men were trapped under twenty thousand tons of steel and concrete, some twenty feet deep. They were the only Port Authority personnel who survived the destruction of the towers, and among only twenty people in all who got out in the end. Nearly 2,700 others weren't as lucky in the WTC puzzle of 9/11.McLoughlin and Jimeno are portrayed superbly in WORLD TRADE CENTER by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, who accurately depict the professional blue-collar ethic of the Big Apple's finest and bravest. Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello, respectively, portray Donna McLoughlin and Allison Jimeno, their wives who were on edge during the entire time of this apocalyptic crisis, wondering whether their husbands were going to make it out of there. Their stories, though individual, serve as a microcosm for the thousands of others there that day, both the dead and the survivors. This last point is something that Stone makes very clear: the kind of humanity in the face of so much inhumanity that day. It is something that has gotten lost in the intervening five years, in which opportunistic politicians have used 9/11 as a weapon to whip up false patriotism, scare tactics, and a bloody war in Iraq that had absolutely nothing to do with the attacks on America. Stone, however, stays away from the kind of political critique that was a hallmark of JFK and several of his other films, and shows us the kind of true heroism that the far-right has often accused Hollywood of deliberately avoiding, but which they themselves couldn't possibly manufacture even on their best day.Along with FLIGHT 93 and UNITED 93, WORLD TRADE CENTER proves that Hollywood is ready to respond with a clear, realistic, and human look at one of this nation's darkest days. So too is the American public, and the world at large. The question now is: Are our politicians willing to do so without resorting to name-calling, pointless propaganda, and macho warmongering? That in and of itself will tell us a lot, and WORLD TRADE CENTER should add to the pressure to force that issue.",10,23,44,18 August 2006
Everest," EVEREST--The World's Tallest Mountain...And The Most Unforgiving, As Well
","No mountain on Earth is taller than Mount Everest. Straddling the border between Nepal and China, in the Himalayas, it rises to a height of 29,028 feet above sea level, near the median height of where most commercial aircraft actually fly, and is perpetually covered in snow and ice even in the summer. While expeditions have tried to reach this lofty summit from either side, it was Edmund Hillary and his Nepalese sherpa climber Tenzing Norgay that made the first successful ascent to and descent from the Everest massif. Since then, dozens upon dozens of expeditions have made the trek up this dangerous mountain; and of all of them, an average of one out of four people have perished. One such incident that caused the deaths of several climbers was one that occurred on May 11, 1996, and which had been documented by Jon Krakauer, one of the participants in that ascent/descent of Everest, in his book 'Into Thin Air'. That same incident (though not adapted from that book) is also depicted in the 2015 film EVEREST.Filmed in IMAX 3-D, the film involves the group of expeditionaires, led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), who made the trek up the southeast slope of the mountain during what was, relatively speaking, the best time of the year, mid-spring. But Everest is not exactly a forgiving mountain, not in the ascent and certainly not on the descent, even in the best of conditions, because, even with base camps scattered along the approach, the air becomes considerably thinner as the altitude increases, and the weather can change sometimes within a matter of hours, if indeed not minutes. This is what the 1996 expedition, which included Krakauer (here portrayed by John Kelly), encountered. While many of them manage to get to the 29,028-foot summit with its icy, top-of-the-world view, on the way down, a monsoonal storm roars in off of the Indian Ocean and, as it ascends the Himalayas, envelopes the expeditionaires in an epic blizzard two thousand feet below the summit. Frantic efforts to rescue everyone, including an ambitious Texas climber (Josh Brolin), end in a wash; and by the time all is said and done, eight of them have died on the mountain, two of whose bodies are never recovered. Clarke is among those eight fatalities.Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur, working from an original screenplay by William Nicholson (GLADIATOR) and Simon Beaufoy (127 HOURS), shot a great deal of Everest in the Italian Alps, as well as on-location scenes in Nepal, not far from where the real Mount Everest is. In doing so, he captured a great deal of the sub-zero cold, treacherous climbing and weather conditions, and the frequent instability of the mountain itself (huge avalanches caused by the weight of thousands of tons of snow piled on). Actors like Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Worthington, and John Kelly (the latter portraying Krakauer) do a great deal of depicting the cockiness of their real-life counterparts prior to the start of the expedition, a cockiness that soon gives way to a stoicism amidst a very nightmarish white reality when the weather turns deadly just below the top of the world. In complete contrast to many previous films of this sort, there is no attempt by either Kormakur, Nicholson, or Beaufoy to melodramatize or make this story more exciting according to Hollywood standards; the facts themselves, and the physical details of the thing are plenty exciting enough, and, above all else, frequently terrifying.Just the physical attributes of this film alone, not just in the ascent and descent but also in the frequent changes in the mountain's stability, and the often crazy weather that can envelope both it and those that climb it, is enough to make EVEREST one of the most challenging and grueling films of any kind made so far in the 21st century. Instead of just being another high-octane action thriller with a lot of explosions and migraine-inducing sound-and-fury, EVEREST is a hugely entertaining and incisive docudrama, and one of the best films of 2015.",10,2,5,25 September 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," The granddaddy of modern science fiction movies
","Every director who specializes in the sci-fi/fantasy genre, from George Lucas to Steven Spielberg to James Cameron, has acknowledged the influence of this epic 1968 Stanley Kubrick/Arthur C. Clarke collaboration.  And it's very easy to see why.  It remains very daring, very probing, very mysterious, and, for many people even today, enormously enigmatic.2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY began life as a modest attempt by Kubrick and Clarke to make the 'proverbial good science fiction film.'  As we all know, it involved into something more.  Its lengthy metaphysical exploration of the forces that shape Mankind's destiny evolved into a $12 million enterprise that, once released in March 1968, set off a firestorm of controversy among critics and audiences.  But young audiences took to this film in such droves that it quickly became a cult classic.  Kubrick's use of classical music pieces for '2001', including the 'Dawn' sequence of Richard Strauss' tone poem 'Also Sprach Zarathustra', became equally legendary.Combining monoliths, malfunctioning computers, fears of technology dehumanizing people, and a sequence that, for my money, remains THE ultimate cinematic special effects display (the Stargate), '2001' is groundbreaking cinema at its most earth-shattering.  Sixteen years later, it would be followed by '2010', a sequel that is a far better movie than its detractors would have you believe.",10,0,1,14 July 2001
Selma," The 50-Mile March That Changed American History
","The civil rights movement that galvanized people of all ages, races, colors, creeds, and religions in the America of the 1960s was one of the most important parts of our history; and at the head of all this was the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King. Even after the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56, and the March on Washington in 1963, black churches in the segregated South were still being bombed; black people were still being lynched; and voting rights were still being denied to those who were neither White nor possessed of enough money. Meanwhile in Washington, even with the Civil Rights Act having been passed, President Lyndon Johnson was still vacillating over the issue of voting rights. To get the point across to Johnson that this was a moral issue, Dr. King and his people organized what became the Selma-to-Montgomery march in March 1965. That event and the things that led up to it are at the heart of director Ava DuVernay's powerful 2014 historical film SELMA.SELMA begins with one of the aforementioned church bombings that characterized the White Southern backlash against the civil rights movement following the killings of three Voting Rights workers in August 1964, and follows the efforts of Dr. King (portrayed here by David Oleyowo) as he attempts to organize a big event that would galvanize the nation. Even as he does this, with help from his wife Coretta (Carmen Ejogo), he is constantly being dogged by hostile forces—in a covert way from the machinations of FBI chieftain J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), and in a more overt and violent way from Alabama governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) and Dallas County sheriff Jim Clark (Stan Houston), plus the brutality from the white segregationists and Ku Klux Klansmen. And there is the issue of Oleyowo's infidelity towards Ejogo at this crucial time in his life and in the life of the movement that he is leading. But once he goes through all these elements, he remains resolute, even through the attempts by Johnson (Wilkinson) to have Oleyowo stop the movement (and supposedly stop the violence), Selma soon becomes the new epicenter of King's quest for equality. It comes at a bloody cost, first with the Bloody Sunday incident on March 7th, and then the KKK-administered beating of one of King's white supporters just a night or two later. None of this deters Oleyowo's quest, however; and on March 21st, he and 8,000 of his fellow citizens, black, white, Jewish, gentile, Protestants, and Catholics alike, make the 50-mile march from Selma, across the infamous Edmund Pettis Bridge, and through two very dangerous Alabama counties to the state capital in Montgomery to press the case.While it can be said that we have made incredibly great strides to get away from the overt bigotry of the past, even with an African-American in the White House at the time of its release, SELMA depicts a time in our history that, though long past, is still relevant today. Racism and bigotry are always going to be parts of certain Americans' DNA, especially since the nation, in the 21st century, is becoming much more ethnically diversified and less White. But it was not always so in Dr. King's time, when blacks often made up the majority of rural counties in the South, but only constituted maybe two percent of the eligible voting population, hemmed in as they were by regulations drawn up by segregationists. Both director DuVernay and screenwriter Webb depict this in very stark fashion, with Oleyowo giving a very stoic performance as the great Dr. King, and Ejiogo equally fine as his wife Coretta. Wilkinson and Roth do very good turns as, respectively, the old guard LBJ and the uber-segregationist Wallace. SELMA also features good turns from Cuba Gooding Jr. as one of the young lawyers arguing the case for the march, and Martin Sheen as the Alabama judge who, though perhaps more covert in his racial views, grants the order allowing the march to go forth.Having seen this film in a theater on Martin Luther King Day in 2015, it made me appreciate even more than I had before how big a part of the mid-to-late 20th century the civil rights movement was in America, at a time when we were going through the most turbulent period in our history since the end of the Civil War; and the lessons from that period are still being absorbed, even though more Americans of non-White ethnicity have entered the political arena in our time. In that sense, SELMA, along with the classic 1970 documentary KING: A FILMED RECORDMONTGOMERY TO MEMPHIS, will likely become required viewing in years to come in high school, community college, and university classes. While we have made great strides, America as a 'more perfect union' is still a work in progress, and SELMA, one of the best films of 2014, illustrates why this is still true even in the 21st century.",10,1,2,30 January 2015
La La Land," Once Upon A Time In (And Around) Los Angeles
","There are various kinds of reality about Los Angeles and its surrounding environs. One is the decades-long reputation it has of making dreams come true. Another, on the opposite end of the spectrum, is the equally long reputation it has of destroying those dreams. And still another is one where every wacky thing that can happen to any part of the human race, good or bad, does indeed happen: televised high-speed car chases; firestorms fueled by Santa Ana winds; incredible urban flooding; earthquakes; ethnic gang murders; riots; entertainment scandals (especially the latter, because...well, there's Hollywood). But in 2016, a totally unusual film came out that tried (and in many ways succeeded) in restoring a fair amount, if not all, of the reputation that L.A. has of being a proud metropolis. That film was LA LA LAND, a film that became one of the highest grossing musicals in Hollywood history and won a staggering six Oscars.Beginning with one of the most elaborate opening musical numbers ever staged for any film, done on location at the interchange of I-105 and I-110, the film charts an aspiring jazz pianist (Ryan Gosling) who finds his career going nowhere, forced as he is to find gigs in dingy bars and clubs in and around L.A., and being prodded by a friend (John Legend) to adjust to the changing times of the jazz genre. And then there is an aspiring actress (Emma Stone) who, in-between casting auditions that also go nowhere, is serving her time out as a barrista to the stars. No one would think that these two disparate souls with dreams that are either being stalled or going in reverse could possibly meet, let alone fall in love. But this being Los Angeles in general, and Hollywood specifically, it does indeed happen.Of course, nothing ever happens without some kinks. Even as Gosling and Stone find themselves falling in love, they also see their careers finally starting to rise, which in turn leads to their budding romance undergoing as much strain as one of the region's many earthquake faults. Stone is initially not even remotely fond of the jazz music that Gosling parlays his trade in; and Gosling is himself cynical of the acting business and even the approach of Angelinos to life in general ('they worship everything, and they value NOTHING'). Still, in between these foibles and acts of dissolution and disillusionment, both Gosling and Stone engage in wily banter and some of the most incredible musical numbers seen in any Hollywood film (outside of animated movies) for decades, including the wish-fulfilling 'City Of Stars'.Damien Chazelle, who wrote and directed the 2014 Oscar-winning drama WHIPLASH, was taking a sizeable risk in making LA LA LAND. He clearly wanted to bring about in the late part of the second decade of the 21st century the same kinds of emotions that one felt in past musicals like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, WEST SIDE STORY, and CABARET, but with something wholly original. But even with more recent box office hits like CHICAGO and DREAMGIRLS, musicals are as expensive to pull off as almost any other kind of film except for comic-book CGI extravaganzas; and some of the biggest ones, even if in the distant past, have been tremendous box office disasters. What Chazelle had going for him here, fortunately, were two extremely appealing leads in Gosling and Stone, as well as supporting turns from Legend, a devotee of old-school R&B and jazz music, and J.K. Simmons (who plays Gosling's boss, and who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in WHIPLASH). And even more to the point, Los Angeles and its satellite cities and landmarks serve as supporting characters themselves: the Hermosa Beach pier; the Griffith Observatory; the Rialto Theater in South Pasadena; the Chateau Marmont in West Hollywood; the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena; and the aforementioned I-105/I-110 interchange in South Los Angeles.Although it is at times a bit emotionally distant, LA LA LAND is still an entirely original musical in which the world, or at least L.A. itself, is the stage and the characters and the region itself all play their parts. This is never the easiest thing to pull off; but Chazelle and company managed to do it, and do it like gangbusters.",9,2,2,16 July 2019
Super 8," SUPER 8 Gets A '10'
","One of the things that make certain summers at the movies something more than just an endless stream of special effects blockbusters that promise a lot of bang for your buck, but in the end seem to offer precious little in the way of substance, is that sometimes there is that special kind of 'blockbuster' that has everything you could want, and something more. SUPER 8, from writer/director J.J. Abrams, who directed the 2009 STAR TREK and 2006's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III, is certainly one of those films for the summer of 2011. Abrams got a lot of help in bringing this film to fruition thanks to the generosity of his mentor Steven Spielberg; and while some will inevitably compare certain aspects of SUPER 8 to Spielberg's own directorial efforts, but the comparisons are just in the way that Abrams seems to understand that special effects alone do not a great movie make.Instead of going with a big-name cast, Abrams went with comparative unknowns, most of whom were young kids. The film is set in a small Ohio town during the summer of 1979. Several kids, including Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning, are in the process of making a zombie horror flick using Super 8-millimeter Kodak film when, one night, they witness a violent train wreck that involves a truck being driven by their biology teacher (Glynn Turman). The accident is caught on camera, and they really think nothing of ituntil the Air Force mysteriously moves in to seal the accident scene. Turman warns the kids that if they tell anyone about this 'incident', they and their parents may suffer some consequences too horrible to contemplate. The local police, led by Chandler, get precious little cooperation from the Air Force guys, including Noah Emmerich, and there's a good reason why. which is revealed step by step and not all at once. This is a film where a certain amount of brainpower and thought is required, even with a young cast in charge.Abrams clearly doesn't make things easy by setting this film back in 1979, nor should he. There are no Blue Tooths, Blackberrys, IPods, the Internet, or digital cameras; instead, the means of communication are traditional telephones, citizens band radios, and the titular Super 8-millimeter camera that the kids use--this, and the sight of souped up and loud Trans-Ams. Abrams does utilize several elements of his mentor's films CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and E.T., in the way things go haywire and the power goes out with the aliens' presence (the aliens remain mostly shadow figures until the climax). And as happens in E.T., the military and the law seem to be depicted in a much more sinister light than the aliens themselves (even with all the mayhem being caused), and the kids, including Fanning (who looks like a dead ringer for a grown-up Drew Barrymore), are far more sympathetic. However, he is wise not to be so overtly slavish of his mentor.The presence of such great 1979 hits as 'Heart Of Glass' (by Blondie) and 'My Sharona' (by the Knack) amidst Giacchino's dramatic score give us a good feel of what it was like back in those days. And while it is tempting in a film of this nature to hype up the special effects work, all of which is extremely good, the effects themselves don't swamp the movie. Even if the alien story part of the film is pretty much part-and-parcel of special effects blockbusters, it is what Abrams does with this plot that makes SUPER 8 more than just another high-budget blockbuster; it is a film worthy of comparisons to Spielberg himself.",10,3,8,11 June 2011
Snowden," SNOWDEN--Blowing The Whistle On Government Malfeasance, And Paying The Price
","By far the biggest story of U.S. government malfeasance was uncovered in 2013, when a young man named Edward Snowden leaked out to the media and the world at large that his employers at the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, besides spying on other countries, and terrorist organizations around the world, were also spying on all the electronic communications of everybody in the United States itself. These revelations made him a man without a country, and a fugitive charged under the Espionage Act of 1917 for allegedly revealing classified information that compromised the security and the lives of U.S. surveillance agents all over the world. It also made him perhaps the most dangerous whistleblower of government overreach in history, or at least since Daniel Ellsberg. And unsurprisingly, it was Oliver Stone, the director best known for his critiques of American political behavior with PLATOON, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, JFK, and NIXON, who stepped into the breach of this, maybe the most important political story of our time, with SNOWDEN.Based on Luke Harding's book 'The Snowden Files' and Anatoly Kucherena's book 'Time Of The Octopus', SNOWDEN stars Joseph Gordon-Leavitt as a young man who, both as an intellectual conservative and a patriot, worked his way up into the highest circles of the U.S. intelligence community during the first decade of the 21st century and the War On Terror, which involved less about stopping terrorism with military force but with the force of electronics and surveillance. This seems all good and fine to him, and he develops further programs to assist the intelligence communityuntil, as he looks up the data, twice as many communications have been monitored from within the U.S. itself as have been from even our most feared legitimate adversary, Russia. Much of the story is told in flashbacks and flash-forwards, as Gordon-Leavitt relates his story to documentary filmmaker Laura Poitros (Melissa Leo), journalist Glenn Greenwald (Zachary Quinto), and journalist Ewan MacAskill (Tom Wilkinson) in a hotel in Hong Kong (later detailed by the real-life Laura Poitros in her Oscar-winning 2014 documentary CITIZENFOUR). We see how his life, especially with his girlfriend (Shailene Woodley) and his problems with epilepsy, comes unwound, and how he must go on the run after his revelations are published in the British newspaper The Guardian, which Greenwald and MacAskill worked for. He winds up at Moscow International Airport just a few days after his story hits the Internet in June 2013, and in exile, a fugitive from what passes for American justice in the 21st century.Rather surprisingly, given his penchant for doing extremely controversial movies in his career, Stone was initially fairly reluctant to touch the Edward Snowden story in any way, shape, or form. But Kucherena (Snowden's real-life attorney in Russia) and Greenwald themselves convinced that it would be good for him to detail the story. Stone then agreed to do it, with Fitzgerald assisting him in the writing of the screenplay, and the result is one of the great films of 2016. Gordon-Leavitt is a near dead-ringer for the real-life Edward Snowden, who is seen at the end of the film detailing why he did what he did and why coming back to America would not result in his getting a fair trial. Although Stone had been well-known for doing films with quick-edged MTV-inspired montage sequences, including his notorious 1994 film NATURAL BORN KILLERS, he avoids doing much of that in SNOWDEN, instead concentrating on the inner workings of Snowden's work, and how much harm he may have been creating in the name of National Security, as opposed to merely keeping us 'safe' from any more 9/11-type terrorism.The subject matter that is broached by Stone in SNOWDEN, even with a relatively limited amount of violence and nudity (compared to other films of Stone's), is not easy to watch; nor is it necessarily easy to grasp in a lot of ways how the American people themselves, in the panic that followed September 11, 2001, basically acquiesced and allowed such mass surveillance to take place. Given the revelations in the early 1970s about Ellsberg's Pentagon Papers scandal, and those involving the FBI's Counterintelligence Program against anti-war protesters and civil rights activists, one might have thought that the people would have learned. But speaking truth against government power is a dangerous thing to do, and at the same time the right one; and SNOWDEN, its subject, and its maker, show it better than perhaps anyone else in Hollywood could ever do.",10,115,147,20 September 2016
A Clockwork Orange," Is the cure worse than the disease?
","Stanley Kubrick was a director who always had the knack for raising troubling issues, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE raises some doozies.Based on Anthony Burgess' controversial 1962 book, the film details the adventures of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a 'droog' whose obsessions include rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven (specifically the Ninth Symphony).  After he is caught by police for murder, he spends two years in a British prison before being selected to undergo the Ludovico treatment, designed to cure criminals of their baser impulses.The problem, however, is that this treatment also saps McDowell of the ability to defend himself against former victims who come seeking revenge. After attempting suicide in the home of a writer he once terrorized, he recovers in a hospital and, in a political ploy of unheard-of proportions, he is restored to health--all his instincts for violence once more intact.Not surprisingly, Kubrick was heavily criticized for his stylized scenes of sex and violence, which were so disturbing they briefly got the film an 'X' rating; slight trimming by Kubrick bought it down to an 'R'.  But beyond those elements, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE retains its unsettling aura for tackling the issues of crime and punishment, and law and order, which are your basic political code words.  He asks us to ponder the evils of brainwashing.  Is the cure that Alex is being given worse than the disease he has spread?  Do politicians have the right to dictate to people how to behave?  Is the price of free will the predilection of a very small minority to act barbaric?Accompanied by the music of Beethoven, Rossini, and others, principally in synthesized arrangements by Walter Carlos, those questions are bought forth in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE; and as is typical for Kubrick, he gives us no easy solutions.  For a diatribe against rampant right-wing conservatism, grab-ass politics, and law-and-order jingoism, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE remains extremely effective, and still timely after thirty years.",9,0,0,20 July 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick misunderstood again. So what else is new?!
","EYES WIDE SHUT was the last film director Stanley Kubrick worked on before his untimely death on March 7, 1999.  And given that virtually all of his films have been misunderstood on first initial viewings, it isn't surprising that this psychosexual drama, containing nudity and sexual content coming just within a stone's throw of being classified as soft-porn, should arouse widely divergent views.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are a very upscale Manhattan couple who, following a lavish party at the home of a good friend (Sydney Pollack), debate sexual infidelities after Cruise is spotted by Kidman flirting with a couple of models.  What follows is an odyssey of sexual tensions for Cruise, including a very strange, almost Edgar Allan Poe-inspired ritual at a Long Island mansion featuring many naked people.I really can't go into any further detail about EYES WIDE SHUT.  I believe it to be a fitting end to the life's work of one of the greatest post-World War II film makers.  But it is a very complex film, not easy to describe in simple terms.  Kubrick is deliberately ambiguous in his approach to the material (inspired by Arthur Schnitzler's 'Traumnovelle'), which I think is what really bewilders, if not angers, a lot of people.  Like everything Kubrick has made, it requires repeat viewings to get the full impact.  It is very lengthy, and its nudity and language make it very unsuitable for anyone under the age of 17.  Otherwise, however, EYES WIDE SHUT is at the very least one of the most intriguing films from a director who clearly inspired many other great ones, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Brian DePalma.",9,0,1,21 July 2001
Die Hard," Not perfect, but far better than anything Schwarzenneger could muster
","With the exception of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, DIE HARD ranks as perhaps the single best action movie of the 1980s.  This 1988 suspense thriller is not, in my opinion, a perfect film; but in light of all the morally rotten Schwarzenneger/Stallone shoot-'em-ups that we had been exposed to, and continue to be exposed to, it is as close to one in the testosterone action genre as there has ever been.Bruce Willis ascended to stardom as New York cop John McClane, out on Christmas sabbatical in Los Angeles to see his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia), who now works in the forty-story Nakatomi Plaza in the Century City district.  The two obviously are at odds, but both have agreed to try to reconcile following an office party on the 30th floor.But all bets are off once a group of heavily-armed terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), seize the building and hold everyone at the party, including Bedelia, hostage while they try to break open the company's computerized vault and its bounty of bearer bonds worth $600 million. Willis, however, has eluded capture; and soon, he begins his own one-man campaign to wittle down the terrorists' numbers not so much through bullets as with his own brains.DIE HARD has two flaws that I think keep it from being an all-out masterpiece.  One is that the LAPD captain in charge (Paul Gleason) acts totally idiotic, which is not anywhere close to being realistic.  Another is that the two FBI agents who take over the operation are so crazy that they make even the most unbalanced terrorist (Alexander Godunov) seem relatively sane.  It slows the plot down just enough to be irritating.That said, however, these slow points are at least righted by solid performances from Willis and Bedelia, as well as Reginald VelJohnson's fine perfomance as the Twinkie-eating cop Al Powell, who has a sympathetic ear to Willis' plight over the radio.  Rickman's performance is one of the best villain roles ever conceived in Hollywood history.  Loosely borrowing elements from such films as THE TOWERING INFERNO and BLACK SUNDAY, director John McTiernan boosts up the suspense extremely well, even though some of the violence and profanity are a bit much.  Michael Kamen's pulse-pounding orchestral score is fairly unusual for an action film, but very welcome, as is the uncredited (though not by the Internet Movie Database) of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.Not an unflawed film, but certainly superior to almost everything of its ilk before it, DIE HARD is extremely worthy as an action film of tremendous energy and skill.",8,1,2,19 September 2001
Psycho," At the Bates Motel, you can take a shower...AT YOUR OWN RISK!
","One can pinpoint with reasonable certainty where the modern horror movie really began.  It began in 1960 with the release of Alfred Hitchcock's all-time masterpiece PSYCHO.The story of Marion Crane stopping off at the Bates Motel and taking the shower which would live in cinematic history and infamy is so well known that no regurgitation of the plot is necessary.  But what is important to know about PSYCHO is the fact that it introduced a number of important elements to the genre that had never been used before.  It introduced us to the 'slasher', in the form of Anthony Perkins' off-balance Norman Bates and his 'Mother.'  It bought the horror film firmly into contemporary times by being set in the present.  It also took a very unique approach to psychology and murder in a way that no film had done before, and few films have done since.What is the most significant about PSYCHO's celebrated shower murder, besides the literal knife-edge editing and Bernard Herrmann's classic shrieking strings, is the way Hitchcock depicts this scene.  So many slasher films entirely miss the point of that scene, focusing only on the (limited) blood.  But Hitchcock manipulates the film in such a way as to make this scene LOOK much more graphic than it really is.  It is a brilliant feat of movie-making on the part of the cinema's ultimate Master Of Suspense.Even the much-criticized final scene involving the psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) isn't very bothersome; he brings up the first real honest-to-goodness explanation of a disturbed killer.  As he relates Norman's story, he tells the group there in the room, 'He was never all Norman.  But he was often ONLY Mother.'Scripted by Joseph Stefano from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, and loosely based on the case of Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Geinn (which also inspired the 1974 cult masterpiece THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), PSYCHO remains a masterpiece to this very day, even after more than four decades of sequels, imitators, imitators of imitators, and an atrocious remake.  No self-respecting fan of horror or suspense movies should be without a copy of this genuine fright classic!",10,1,1,27 April 2002
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs: A Troubled Genius Of Silicon Valley
","Genius is often a tough thing to define; and for the person that is frequently defined as a genius, it can lead to a feeling of invincibility, a feeling that you know more than anyone else, inherent insecurity, and indifference. A fair amount of that was very true of Steve Jobs, the co-founder, with Steve Wozniak, in 1976 of Apple, which over the ensuing two decades of turmoil and enormous growth became one of the biggest technological corporations on the planet. His death from a pancreatic tumor in the fall of 2011 at the shockingly early age of 56 led to a stream of films, documentary and feature alike. One of those was the 2015 opus STEVE JOBS.Based on Walter Isaacson's hugely successful biography that included a lot of interviews with the man, STEVE JOBS stars Michael Fassbender as the 'resident genius' of the explosive Silicon Valley technological scene of the 1980s always busy dreaming up new technological marvels, and parsing off blame on others when things don't go according to his own version of Hoyle. Indeed, his reactions to his former colleagues, like Wozniak (Seth Rogan) and former Pepsi chairman John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), and even his own marketing executive Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet), are ones of almost intolerable cruelty, including Daniels having axed Fassbender from Apple, and Rogan pointing out in graphic detail how much he, and not Fassbender, created the computers and operating systems that made Apple a technological giant in the first place. And then flesh-and-blood reality in the form of a former girlfriend of his (Katherine Waterston) and her daughter, intrude; and he Fassbender is eventually forced to confront the failures in his rise to the top that were caused by his cold obsession with 'changing the world'.Fassbender does not have an easy job in his portrayal of Jobs, largely because he has to get into the skin of the techno-genius, and that skin is clearly crawling with ego. Truth be told, Fassbender's portrayal really comes across as one of the bigger egomaniacal bastards seen on screen in recent times. This probably has a lot with the real Jobs having been so candid about himself with Isaacson in the book prior to his passing, though such a character, in what passes for today's Hollywood, can be seen as rather repellent. But that would seem to be what Steve Jobs himself was often like, especially during those times that the film focuses on, the roll-outs of new products of Jobs' own skewed creative mind that happened in 1984, 1988, and 1998. It also doesn't hurt that the direction of Danny Boyle (SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE; 28 DAYS LATER; 127 HOURS), and the screenplay adaptation of Isaacson's book by Aaron Sorkin (A FEW GOOD MEN; THE SOCIAL NETWORK) have both a marvelous technological sheen and a scathingly sardonic edge (peppered with a fair amount of profane bits of dialogue) to it.Nevertheless, despite (or maybe because of) the realistic, if frequently unsympathetic, portrayal of Jobs by Fassbender, along with Winslet's, Daniels', and Rogan's performances, the film is a very direct look at how being a 'genius' with an outsized ego to match can do funny things to those who have both. STEVE JOBS, as such, is worthy of a '9' rating from me.",8,0,0,17 May 2018
War of the Worlds," Cruise And Spielberg Go To WAR With The Help Of H.G. Wells
","Ever since its first publication in 1898, H.G. Wells' classic novel 'The War Of The Worlds' has intrigued and stunned audiences. When Orson Welles' did his radio version of the book in 1938, it scared half of the eastern United States almost to death. And when producer George Pal and director Byron Haskin adapted it for film in 1953, it cagily tapped into America's Cold War anxieties. And now director Steven Spielberg, after having made alien-friendly movies like CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and E.T., takes on Wells' novel with mega-budget special effects and terror in this new version, designed as something of a commentary on America after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS focuses primarily around Tom Cruise, who plays a deadbeat dad to his grown-up son (Justin Chatwin) and daughter (Dakota Fanning). Never all that much of a father, or for that matter a husband to his good wife (Miranda Otto), Cruise all of a sudden must assume that responsibility when alien invaders begin tearing apart New England and New York City. Their arrival is heralded by massive lightning storms over the Big Apple, and then the appearance of tripod-like spacecraft and lasers that incinerate everyone in site. It is up to Cruise to get both Chatwin and Fanning out of New York anyway he can and head towards safety in Boston, where Otto is. But they can't run anyplace the massive alien invaders can't find them. All the might of the military isn't enough to stop the aliens, but there is one thing nobody, not even the aliens themselves, had even counted upon...Given the weight of expectations, and the reputations of both Spielberg and Cruise, it is not surprising that there are a slew of naysayers regarding this take on Wells' novel, particularly its typically Hollywood happy ending. But as for me, I was riveted during the whole 125 minute run time of the movie; it was consistently suspenseful and hair-raising at all the right moments, and accurately captured the kind of paranoia and terror that might arise from an alien invasion of our planet, and that DID arise from the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Although it definitely reflects the post-9/11 paranoia that has gripped America, Spielberg, like Pal and Haskin before him, also shows a certain cynicism towards unilateral military action, a view held by Spielberg and those of his generation during both the Vietnam era and today.Marking its return on film is one of Spielberg's favorite themes--that of the irresponsible father figure who must assume total responsibility for keeping his children safe in the face of an overwhelming threat. Spielberg, not surprisingly, handles that theme better than anyone because of its personal resonance to his life; and Cruise plays that cocksure role of his to perfection. Chatwin, Fanning, and Otto do good turns, as does Tim Robbins in a cameo; and Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, the stars of Pal's 1953 classic, have brief cameos at the end as the grandparents.With an intense screenplay by Josh Friedman and David Koepp, Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS, all controversies aside, is a hugely memorable film and not just another mega-budget Hollywood spectacle.",10,1,8,5 July 2005
Man on Fire," Vengeance In Mexico City
","Although released among a flock of revenge-minded action flicks (KILL BILL VOL. 2; THE PUNISHER; WALKING TALL), MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always-watchable Denzel Washington, one of the best actors around today.In MAN ON FIRE, based on A.J. Quinnell's 1980 novel (first filmed in 1987, with Scott Glenn), Washington plays a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels, until his old partner (Christopher Walken) offers him a chance at redemption.  He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his American-born wife (Radha Mitchell). While he and Fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past.  It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed.  With almost any other stock action hero (Schwarzenneger; Segal, etc.), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before.  But Washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does.  Still, he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) out to expose 'La Hermanidad' (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction.MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work, nearly headache-inducing montage editing, and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), but which are not necessarily unique to him (witness Oliver Stone's use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films).  Still, Scott gets a very good performance from Washington, as well as Fanning, who comes across as far more than a typical movie-brat kid.  Harry Gregson-Williams' south-of-the-border Spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of Chopin, Debussy, and even Linda Ronstadt's classic 1977 country-rock version of 'Blue Bayou.'  Although the film overall is quite violent, it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years, and overall it is much better than most.",7,89,136,10 May 2004
Whiplash," Driven To Extremes
","Trying to be the best at anything can frequently come at a price for anybody famished enough to want to go for it. This is especially true when we talk about fame here in the United States, where it seems Vince Lombardi's mantra 'Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing' is something that is far too instilled in our culture. This is personified in the 2014 film WHIPLASH, the film that put its writer and director Damien Chazelle on the map in a big way.Miles Teller portrays Andrew Neimann, an aspiring 19 year-old jazz drummer who has enrolled himself at New York's Shaffer Academy, where he comes to the attention of music instructor Terence Fletcher, portrayed by J.K. Simmons (who snagged a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role, and rightly so). To say that Simmons' teaching methods are unconventional would be a monumental understatement. Simmons' character Terence Fletcher is the musical conservatory equivalent of Lee Ermey's drill instructor in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 Vietnam War classic FULL METAL JACKET, a man who is more than willing to push all of his students, but none more so than Teller, to their musical and even psychological extremes with a whole host of basically shouted scatological imprecations and more than a few choice four-letter words. Teller's own father (Paul Reiser), despite being proud of his son's dedication to the art of jazz drumming, fears for his son's own sanity under Simmons' near-psychotic dedication to the art of perfection, to the point where Teller's hands actually bleed onto the drum kit. Getting involved in a car crash (the same kind of incident that a previous student had while struggling to cope with Simmons' methodology, and which led him to hang himself), Teller finally goes to the authorities and finally gets Simmons 86ed from Shaffer...something that Simmons inevitably finds out about. But it is Teller who will have the last word.Based to a large degree on the experiences Chazelle had had in his high school's band, which led him into filmmaking, WHIPLASH is an often-exhausting film to watch...and at times, deeply unsettling. Simmons, gets results by hurling the most demeaning insults imaginable at the students in general, and Teller in particular, because it is his belief that he can get the next Charlie Parker out of these guys, something that, by his own admission, he had never been able to do. To him, the two worst words any teacher can say to any student are 'Good Job'; he'll accept nothing short of perfection, because to him Jazz is a dying musical genre in America. Chazelle, to his credit, even though he both wrote the screenplay and directed the film based on his short film of the same name, doesn't necessarily see perfection as a bad thing, but he doesn't exactly believe that Simmons' method of getting there is exactly a good thing either. Teller does a yeoman job of showing us how his character's dedication to perfection, having to somehow 'please' a tyrant who is all but impossible to please even on the best of days, drives him almost to the brink of psychical exhaustion and even a psychological breakdown. It is not hard to put ourselves in Teller's shoes, because some of us have been in this position a time or two, with a character like Simmons here (and Ermey in FULL METAL JACKET).But even with the experience of the first thirty minutes of Kubrick's great movie and Ermey's performance in there, the whole of WHIPLASH, with Simmons and Teller battling back and forth, is emotionally and psychologically draining, especially when compared to the carefree spirit of Chazelle's next film LA LA LAND, and the awe-inspiring FIRST MAN.WHIPLASH is a extremely masterful character study. But be prepared for its emotional extremities",9,0,0,2 December 2019
Jaws," The film that took a big bite out of beach business
","One of the most traumatic productions in Hollywood history also turned out to be one of Hollywood's greatest masterpieces of terror.  JAWS is often blamed (wrongly, I think) for starting this obsession Hollywood has with blockbuster hits.  I say 'wrongly blamed', because, besides grossing a quarter of a billion dollars at the box office (the first film to do so), JAWS is really a very great movie.The story itself is familiar: a New England coastal resort town terrorized by a Great White shark, a mayor unwilling to put his town's economy at risk so that the shark can be killed, etcetera, etcetera.  The problems they had with the mechanical shark are even more familiar.  But the fact remains that JAWS works, because Steven Spielberg has never been the kind to let go of a vision he is in the process of making into his own--and this was no exception.  Instead of making it into a visceral monster movie, Spielberg took to not showing the shark for the first two-thirds of the movie (although the fact that he had very little choice had more than a little to do with it), thus mandating an Alfred Hitchcock approach to things.  He is helped by the excellent performances of Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss, as well as John Williams' classic score.  The score, Verna Fields' editing, and the production sound team of John Carter and Robert Hoyt won Oscars for their work.And of course one must thank Spielberg for having delivered a truly terrifying and dramatic piece of cinema, and not just an ARMAGEDDON-style sound-and-fury event.  JAWS, even after a quarter century-plus of being sequalized, parodied, and ripped off, is still a Hollywood masterpiece.",10,2,4,6 August 2001
WALL·E," WALL-E: The Robot Who Saved Humanity
","Disney/Pixar has consistently outdone itself in every movie it has released since its collaborative history began in the mid-1990s: TOY STORY; CARS; RATATOUILLE; and FINDING NEMO, to name just a few. But in 2008, they really outdid themselves by creating a storyline set in the far future, in which the very existence of Earth and humanity itself rest in the hands of an unlikely hero. That unlikely hero was WALL-E; and his adventure, when it burst onto the big screen that summer resulted in an enormous box office windfall for Disney/Pixar totaling close to $600 million, plus a well-deserved Oscar for Best Animated Film.The titular character of the piece is, for all intents and purposes, a squat trash compactor, whose name WALL-E stands for Waste Allocation Load Lifter-Earth Class. His job, as has been the case for 700 years, is to clean up the mess that humanity left behind on Earth, compacting various bits of trash into cubes, and whiling away his spare time with a cockroach and a surviving VHS copy of the 1968 film musical HELLO DOLLY. Wall-E, however, has also gained a sense of of self-awareness and insatiable human curiosity, as can be seen by his consistently wan expression; and when he sees a small sprout of a plant poking up from underneath an otherwise polluted ground, he senses a change in the air. He is then visited upon by a female robot called EVE (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, who), upon learning of the existence of the plant in Wall-E's possession, takes both it and Wall-E up to the intergalactic cruise ship 'Axiom', now in its 700th year of existence, to prove that life on Earth is coming back.All of this, of course, is new to Wall-E, as are some fairly disturbing things, like the non-stop consumption of the passengers, fed to them by the same mega-conglomerate, Buy N Large (BNL) that fatally polluted Earth, and their morbid obesity; and the conflict between the ship's captain and the on-board computer named Auto, whose red eye is so much like HAL in director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. With Eve's help, however, and after many wacky misadventures, Wall-E helps the captain retake control of the ship, and steer it back towards Earth once the existence of the little plant becomes fact. In the meantime, Eve and Wall-E begin an electronic love affair that has been building from that first portentous meeting.The swath of digital animation films to come from Disney/Pixar has been nothing short of amazing, but they definitely outdid themselves with WALL-E. Apart from the genuine likability of Wall-E himself (as engaging a non-human character as any since E.T.), there are numerous homages to films as varied as SILENNT RUNNING (the 1972 ecological cult classic), George Lucas' low budget 1971 feature debut THX 1138; the Oscar-winning 2006 documentary AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH; Spielberg's A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT; and even Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi/film-noir masterpiece BLADE RUNNER. And one must also congratulate director and co-writer Andrew Stanton for slipping in the homages to '2001', with the AUTO/HAL connection and the uses of Richard Strauss' 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' and Johann Strauss' 'The Blue Danube', even if most children viewing WALL-E likely haven't seen that masterpiece or the other films this one references...at least not yet.There are also several ironic comments about human consumption and greed, personified by BNL's CEO Shelby Forthright, amusingly played by Fred Willard, and whose rhetoric of 'stay the course' should sound vaguely familiar to any adult viewer. The messages, however, are never delivered in a heavy-handed fashion; and the focus remains on the relationships that Wall-E develops throughout the film, both with his fellow robots, especially Eve, and with the humans on-board the 'Axiom'; and all of this is aided by Newman's fantastic and futuristic original score.The end result in WALL-E is a three-pronged success: a typically successful animated comedy; a science fiction voyage; and a reminder of how we can change our planet for the better while there is still time left to do so.",10,0,1,6 May 2011
The Terminal," Culture Shock
","Loosely based on a true story of a Middle Easterner stranded in Paris, THE TERMINAL is Steven Spielberg's latest film, and he manages to pull off something of a miracle--a series of comical moments integrating themselves into a good story.Tom Hanks, who was superb in previous Spielberg films SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, is once again sterling in his role of Victor Navorski, a native of the fictional East European country of Krakozhia who finds himself totally stranded at New York's JFK Airport when his country falls victim to a political coup.  The airport's homeland security chief (Stanley Tucci) can't get him on a flight back; and because the U.S. government doesn't recognize Krakozhia's current (if temporary) regime, Tucci can't even allow Hanks to take one step out of the airport's International Arrivals Terminal.  Thus, Hanks sets up 'home' at Gate 67 and subsequently makes life for Tucci and his security guards a living, comical hell, with his constant misunderstandings of American culture and political protocol, making friends with some of the airport's behind-the-scenes people, and attracting the eye of a romantically confused flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones).Spielberg's ability to get laughs from this film's situation far exceeds the below-average attempt he made twenty-five years ago with '1941.'  Yes, there are some slapstick moments, but they are better integrated into the story and are not the ENTIRE story, as they had been in '1941.'  Hanks and Spielberg, who have become our era's equivalent of James Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock, are of course matchless, and Zeta-Jones isn't too bad herself. Tucci makes for a very solid kind of heavy, and THE TERMINAL also pokes political holes at what constitutes 'Homeland Security' in the post-9/11 world we find ourselves living in now.Highly recommended for its quirky style, THE TERMINAL is yet another reason to treasure Spielberg as a cinematic American treasure.",8,0,1,3 July 2004
Platoon," The truth comes out
","It took Americans a very long time to accept the fact that our involvement in Vietnam, however well-intentioned it might have been to begin with, was in the end a tragic failure.  Not only were fifty-eight thousand of our finest young people killed, but so were two million more Vietnamese.But it took the guts and the intelligence of Vietnam vet Oliver Stone to bring this point home in his masterpiece PLATOON.  Pretty much autobiographical, PLATOON stars Charlie Sheen as a recruit who, upon entering country, is put into a rag-tag platoon patrolling the Central Highlands of Vietnam during the fall of 1967.  After some truly horrific first combat scenes, Sheen finally gets his bearings but then realizes the tragic mistake he made in joining to fight.  Soon, he becomes involved in an inter-platoon war between his two sergeants--Barnes (Tom Berenger), the personification of Death and Reality; and Elias (Willem Dafoe), the personification of Humanity.In the end, we come to the realization that the enemy was always staring us in the face; but instead of being Oriental or communist, that face was American.  It was us against ourselves, as Sheen points out in his closing narration.  Oliver Stone must be commended for portraying this misbegotten war for what it was: the death of a nation's innocence where we all found out just how imperfect we could really be.",10,1,2,31 July 2001
Prometheus," Ridley Scott Returns To Familiar ALIEN Territory
","The 1979 film ALIEN took the modern-day lead in alien invasion and/or possession movies with some fairly gruesome special effects (remember the alien bursting through John Hurt's chest?), and making it so that any film of this sort more or less has had to utilize those same methods from that point on, with the most noticeable example being John Carpenter's 1982 opus THE THING. And now, in a new century, thirty-three years after that huge box office achievement, ALIEN (and BLADE RUNNER) director Ridley Scott has returned to this theme with PROMETHEUS.Named for the Greek god who stole and gave the gift of fire and was cast out from Mount Olympus, the spaceship 'Prometheus' and her crew are venturing through the galaxy to find the origins of the strange lights in the sky that ancient Earth civilizations, including the Egyptians and the Mayans, reputedly saw some thirty-five thousand years before—an idea floated around by theologian Erich von Daniken. When they arrive on a planet hundreds of billions of miles from Earth, they find evidence of this in a huge hollow mountain on the surface. Unfortunately, what they also find is that this alien presence is extremely hostile; and one by one, they die very horrible deaths. In between, they come to realize that these aliens are actually intent on hitching a ride on 'Prometheus' and coming to Earth in order to either destroy or possess every living human being there. In doing so, they have to sacrifice themselves, often in the most horrible ways; and in the end, one of the female crew members (Noomi Repace), who had initially been infected and impregnated by one of the alien beings, manages to escape the planet in one of the various spaceships left over from the alien race. But there's something she doesn't know yet....In essence, Scott is going back to the basic premise of ALIEN, so much to the point that it could be argued that basically PROMETHEUS itself is a basic reworking of the 1979 blockbuster, with a 'Chariots Of The Gods' plot thrown in, and some up-to-date and extremely graphic alien special effects. The crew of 'Prometheus' here is far less well known than the cast that comprised the crew of 'Nostromo' in ALIEN; only Charlize Theron, who had won an Oscar in 2003 for portraying a serial killer in MONSTER, and Guy Pearce, who was in the 1997 film noir hit L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, have any real 'name value.' As a result, whatever success PROMETHEUS can claim, though it is substantial, must rest on how well the entire cast, the gruesome plot, and Scott's direction hold up under very close scrutiny.And given how many dozens of alien invasion movies there have been since he made ALIEN, one wouldn't understand what more Scott could do to make PROMETHEUS really stand out. And in truth, he really doesn't. But the one thing he does different from most alien invasion films is that he is given a good plot outline from Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (based on unused elements from the original Dan O'Bannon/Ronald Shusett script for ALIEN), a good cast, and credible production values, the kind that somehow seem to fly out the window in most blockbuster films because of the need to concentrate on spectacle. Therefore, despite some imperfections and a lot of gruesomeness, PROMETHEUS succeeds better than most others of its kind today.",8,0,7,14 June 2012
Halloween," A Masterpiece of Suspense and Horror
","Without resorting to buckets of blood, director John Carpenter made one of the best horror movies of the 1970 (and of all time, for that matter) with HALLOWEEN.  I rank it right up there with JAWS and CARRIE.Its story of a masked maniac who comes home to Haddonfield, Illinois on Halloween night to create more murderous mayhem after having been locked away for fifteen years has admittedly become a cliche.  It has been imitated hundreds of times over, usually with awful, bloody results (FRIDAY THE 13TH, SCREAM, etc.).  Still, what Carpenter managed to do with just $375,000 and with a relatively small cast and crew is far more remarkable than what a bunch of horror-film hacks can do with millions of dollars worth of gory special make-up effects.The homages to Hitchcock's PSYCHO are by now legendary: our heroine, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, is Janet Leigh's real-life daughter; the character played by Donald Pleasance is named Sam Loomis (the same as John Gavin's character in PSYCHO).  Like Hitchcock (and indeed like Steven Spielberg and Brian DePalma as well), Carpenter pushes the suspense angle very well. This, as much as anything else, is what puts HALLOWEEN head and shoulders above its atrocious rip-offs.",10,0,0,11 July 2001
Paths of Glory," Kubrick's Scathing Indictment Of War And Military Tribunals
","It is an unfortunate fact of humanity that few things seem to stimulate it more than watching hundreds of thousands die in war, no matter the enemy and no matter the necessity. But it is equally true that war has been commented upon time immemorial on the big screen, sometimes with utter jingoism being involved (as is the case with many a John Wayne film), but usually with a 'Man's inhumanity to Man' comment involved. Such is true of director Stanley Kubrick's 1957 film PATHS OF GLORY, set against the horrible backdrop of World War I and involving a criminal court-martial that, by itself, is even more horrible than the war itself.Based on Humphrey Cobb's classic novel of the same name, PATHS OF GLORY involves a French army regiment's charge against a heavily fortified German ant hill on the Western Front, instigated by an ambitious general (George Macready) who has been promised a promotion by his superior (Adolphe Menjou) should it succeed. Needless to say, despite the efforts of most of the men, the withering mortar fire of the Germans causes the attack to be a crippling disaster; and Macready, looking for someone to blame for an attack that was strategically pointless from the get-go, orders that three men (Timothy Carey; Ralph Meeker; Joe Turkel) who could not advance far out of the trenches be put on trial for cowardice, a charge that carries with it execution by firing squad. Kirk Douglas, who portrays the men's trench commander and who in civilian life is an attorney, is given the unenviable task of defending his men against charges that, just on face value alone, are extremely ludicrous, but he is prevented by the General Staff and the prosecutors (including Richard Anderson) from presenting exculpatory evidence. As a result, not even three days after the Ant Hill attack, the three men are executed. Douglas, however, uncovers evidence of Macready's complicity in the attack and the fact that he ordered other French troops to fire on the psychologically paralyzed men. He also confronts Menjou with Menjou's own complicity in this sick and pointless incident, verbally denouncing the general square in the face.Having achieved a great early standing with his 1956 crime film THE KILLING, Kubrick became internationally known on the basis of this masterful and scathing combination of war and courtroom drama that, as would be the pattern of many of his films, was also the source of controversy. Its depiction of the behavior of French commanding officers attracted a lot of scorn in France, so much so that PATHS OF GLORY was not shown there until the late 1970s; and several US bases in other countries in Europe weren't allowed to show it either until the early 1970s. As with so many detractors of Kubrick's films, however, the French and American military censors missed the point. The film does not dishonor the men who actually did the fighting in the war, but it does severely scrutinize the commanders who sit behind their desks in sheltered chateaus, prosecute wars and trials as if they were marks of manhood, and destroy those who won't follow the most ludicrous of orders. This can be said not only of World War I, but also of almost every military conflict that has come in its wake, from World War II to Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq. What is equally important is how Kubrick, often criticized in his career as a cold director, is able to depict the best of humanity (in Douglas and the three men he has to defend) against both the inhumanity of the kind of trench warfare that World War I was, and the basic inhuman bureaucracy represented by Macready, Menjou, and Anderson. PATHS OF GLORY, much like the similar Lewis Milestone classic ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, is a hard-hitting look at what war does; and unlike so many jingoistic films of the war genre, it shows how it damages soldiers and also how it absolutely corrupts commanders.Kubrick shot most of this film in the countryside outside of Munich, West Germany, and he gets the most out of his actors, including Douglas (in one of his most powerful and humane performances), while Menjou and Macready accurately depict the toadying commanders who plan and decide with only glory in their minds (but as the old saying goes, 'the paths of glory lead but to the grave'). The end result in PATHS OF GLORY was a milestone film for Kubrick as a director, and a signpost for Hollywood that it could no longer depict war as merely a flag-waving, patriotic venture or grist for political propaganda. It is a masterpiece of the highest order, one of many in Kubrick's canon.",10,0,1,18 December 2012
Carrie," Classic Mix Of Horror And Drama
","From Stephen King's very first novel came this classic 1976 horror film from director Brian De Palma. Alongside Steven Spielberg's JAWS and John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, CARRIE was a 1970s horror masterpiece.Granted, by today's standards of blood, gore, and guts, CARRIE may not seem like much. But almost none of today's horror films manages to be effective as both Horror and Drama as CARRIE is. Yes, there are the classic horror moments (the pig's blood; the firestorm; and the hand-from-the-grave shock at the end, inspired by the equally brilliant DELIVERANCE), and De Palma's direction effectively echoes Hitchcock without ever blatantly imitating the Master. But what makes CARRIE so effective in its story of a repressed high school student who takes telekinetic revenge on those who have humiliated and tormented her once too often is the devastating, Oscar-nominated performance by Sissy Spacek in the title role. There probably isn't anybody else who could have played the part with such devastating effectiveness. Spacek, in fact, may well have given the single greatest performance by an actress in a horror film right here.Pino Donnagio's effective score, which echoes not only Bernard Herrmann but even Stravinsky, tops off one of the most effective, indeed one of the most downright disturbing, horror films of all times. CARRIE is a film that will certainly be remembered long after SCREAM, URBAN LEGEND, and all their myriad clones have been forgotten. It is by any standard one of the most important and disturbing horror films of all times.",10,1,1,6 July 2001
Tombstone," Gunfight at the not-so-OK Corral
","The legend of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday has long been a staple of western movies time after time.  But the legend was brilliantly bought back to life in the excellent 1993 movie TOMBSTONE.Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer are excellent in their roles of the guilt-ridden sheriff Wyatt Earp and his tubercular friend Doc Holliday.  They, along with Morgan (Bill Paxton) and Virgil (Sam Elliott), come to the mining town of Tombstone to seek their fortune.  Instead, however, they wind up becoming not only gamblers but making a return as lawmen when the ruthless gang known as the Cowboys, led by the perpetually drunk Ike Clanton (Stephen Lang), turn the dusty streets of Tombstone red with the blood of innocent people. Frontier justice was never like this.Well directed by George Cosmatos (who helmed the infamous RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II in 1985), TOMBSTONE, like other films based on the legend (MY DARLING CLEMENTINE, GUNFIGHT AT THE O.K. CORRAL, HOUR OF THE GUN), sticks pretty close to the facts (**SPOILER**: the real shootout at the O.K. Corral lasted only about forty seconds, and the film is dead-on in accurately recreating that).  TOMBSTONE is further boosted by Dana Delany's efficient performance as Wyatt's future wife Josephine Marks, the excellent Bruce Broughton score, and the expansive cinematography from master cameraman William Fraker (BULLITT, ROSEMARY'S BABY).TOMBSTONE proves that there is still life to be had in the western genre; it is a shame that Hollywood seems to have forgotten that.",10,0,0,2 August 2001
Speed," 26 Years Later, Keep Being Ready For Rush Hour
","Since the 1980s it has been rare for action films to offer up something more than just testosterone-laden violence. But this was indeed what the 1994 blockbuster SPEED was: a sleeper hit and a breath of fresh air for the genre. While it may have much of the same violence and profanity of most action films, it also has a fair amount of suspense, tension, and black comedy as well. Above all else, it has characters one can identify with, plus an absolutely requirement for any really good action film: a credible and despicable villain. Coming from what had already become a disreputable genre among critics for the most part, SPEED actually got a huge amount of critical acclaim, not to mention a $350 million box office take on a budget of a mere $30 million-and this at a time when the cost of a typical Hollywood studio action film had already crossed the $75 million threshold.Keanu Reeves stars as an elite L.A.P.D. officer who, along with the help of his erstwhile partner (Jeff Daniels), defuses the bomb of a madman (Dennis Hopper) inside an elevator in a high rise in Downtown Los Angeles. Daniels is wounded in a brief standoff with Hopper; and Hopper escapes, having not collected the $3 million he demanded for those being held hostage in the elevator.Days later, Hopper plans his revenge against Reeves. This time, Hopper has placed a bomb underneath a commuter bus heading from Santa Monica to Downtown L.A. via the Santa Monica Freeway. The catch is that this bomb is armed the moment the bus hits 50 miles per hour, and that the bomb will detonate if the bus slows below 50. Hopper demands $3.7 million and warns Reeves that, if he tries to take any passengers off the bus, he will detonate the bomb regardless. Reeves is forced into quick action, hopping on the bus in the middle of the freeway and scaring the hell out of all the passengers. One of them, a scared Latino with a gun, accidentally shoots the bus driver, briefly causing the bus to go out of control. A female passenger (Sandra Bullock) is forced to take control of the bus, and is told by Reeves to do whatever it takes to keep going over 50. The bus's path takes it off the Santa Monica Freeway at Western Avenue, then south to the unopened Century Freeway (I-105), then to the runways at LAX. There, Reeves manages to outwit Hopper and evacuate the passengers, with a, how shall we say, a rather explosive result. But Hopper isn't quite vanquished even after all that.While there are admittedly a few of the plot problems normally associated with action movies, SPEED nevertheless delivers much in the way of suspense and camera work, with the influences of films like DUEL, ROLLERCOASTER, THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE, and DIE HARD flowing right through it. Reeves and Bullock make for such an appealing and believable pair that one can't help but be involved in their situation. Hopper makes for a credible enough villain, even as it's a role he could have conceivably done in his sleep. The most amazing thing about the film is the sureness of the direction of Jan DeBont, previously a cinematographer on CUJO, DIE HARD, and THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. DeBont clearly studied not only the films of Hitchcock, but also of Steven Spielberg, and even Sam Peckinpah, in the way action, suspense, and a certain amount of violence (none of the latter especially gratuitous) are combined to make a thoroughly memorable brew. There is also a winking nod to Stanley Kubrick as well, at the end.An Oscar winner for Sound and Sound Effects Editing, SPEED displayed a tremendous amount of energy in its execution and performance. But it also became a prime masterpiece of a genre that had very few masterpieces like it since the 1980s, and would have fewer still from 1994 forward.To this day, SPEED still warrants a '10' spot.",10,0,0,24 May 2020
The Sixth Sense," For me, the last great horror film of the 20th century
","Just for my money, the 1999 thriller THE SIXTH SENSE was the last really great horror movie of the 20th century--forget even the much-debated BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.What makes THE SIXTH SENSE so good is writer/director M. Night Shayamalan's decision to take this story in a manner which is totally the antithesis of today's horror films--i.e., no extraneous blood and guts or nudity--and build a spooky atmosphere.  The connection between the psychologist (Bruce Willis) and the young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who sees visions of dead people is one of the more honest adult-to-child connections I've ever seen outside of a Steven Spielberg film.  And no matter what anyone else says, the first time I saw this film, I did not see the twist ending coming, nor did a lot of other people either their first time around.  That coda is perhaps the best sting-in-the-tail ending since the original PLANET OF THE APES; and somehow, I have the feeling that Rod Serling, no slouch with sting-in-the-tail endings he (see 'The Twilight Zone' and APES), would have been proud of Shayamalan for it.Elements of CARRIE, THE SHINING, and POLTERGEIST, three great horror films all, are present in THE SIXTH SENSE--and yet, this doesn't feel too terribly derivative.  I'd put this movie very close to the aforementioned three movies in the horror film pantheon because of its deeply penetrating story and its psychological scares, which were all honestly earned.  In summary, THE SIXTH SENSE is a winner.",10,0,0,10 August 2001
The Purge," THE PURGE: We Have Met The Enemy...And It Is Us
","The premise behind writer/director James DeMonaco's film THE PURGE is indeed a fantastic and, perhaps at first, unlikely one: set in the year 2022, when unemployment nationwide is down to just one percent, and crimes across the board are at an all-time low. But what if the manner of getting it that was to allow a one-night 'purge', in which violent behavior was actually sanctioned by the United States government, and largely to rid America of the poor and the indigent? It is a premise that may seem outrageous; but so too was the idea of a surveillance state as depicted in George Orwell's classic 1948 novel '1984'; and what has America become since 9/11 but a surveillance state in real life? Under the right circumstances, it isn't totally out of the realm of possibility that something like THE PURGE might come to pass.Ethan Hawke portrays a security systems designer whose entire neighborhood, located in the hills above West Los Angeles, owes its very security and safety to his security designs. It becomes especially important during a twelve-hour time frame from 7 PM to 7 AM on March 21st and 22nd, 2022 known as 'The Purge', in which violent behavior, including murder, theft, and even rape, will be allowed—and no police or emergency first responders will be on duty. It is a thing that Hawke and his family, and their neighbors, have gotten used to; and they have also become largely callous when it comes to the potential victims of the Purge, namely the poor who don't have the ability to support themselves with any job or pay approaching anywhere close to what Hawke makes. But on this particular Purge Night, one of Hawke's children (Max Burkholder), out of the goodness of his heart and a conscience that the father has apparently lost, lets a wounded black man (Edwin Hodge) enter the premises, which upsets Hawke tremendously. To Hawke, Hodge is exactly the kind of target the Purge people want to kill; and when the leader (Rhys Wakefield) of one such Purge group comes to get Hodge, Hawke, his family, and their home come under siege from that group. Hawke at first advocates handing over Hodge to them (given that the Purge group has already totally crippled what Hawke had once proclaimed a foolproof security system), but his wife (Lena Headey), daughter (Adelaide Kane) and Burkholder, appalled at his descent into cold-blooded survivalist mode, force the issue. In the end, they are forced to endure much physical horror and psychological terror until the morning comesand does it really end there? DeMonaco wrote and directed THE PURGE on a budget of just slightly more than $3 million; and apart from the sometimes shaky and unsteady camera work (a trait that came from the quasi-documentary style of films like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY), every penny of that $3 million budget shows up here. There are a number of things that don't quite work the way they should; and some of the acting, especially by Wakefield as the chief Purge instigator, is overly hammy. In terms of what DeMonaco is basically trying to do with what is certainly a fantastic and crazy premise, however, THE PURGE is effective enough. Some would claim, in a rather ham fisted fashion, that DeMonaco is attacking the behavior of the Far Right in America and its attitudes towards those who have less than they do. But I have to wonder if any of the reviewers making those claims noticed that the upscale rich people in THE PURGE turn against their own in the end. This kind of has a Rod Serling-like twist to it if you really think about it hard enough--'The Monsters Are On Maple Street', anyone?. We have met the enemy, and it's really us.Besides that aforementioned 'Twilight Zone' reference, THE PURGE seems to derive its power and plot from many films: the original ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13; A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (the masks worn by Wakefield and his posse); THE BIRDS; NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; STRAW DOGS (the original 1971 Sam Peckinpah classic); and even THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND (Peckinpah's last, released in 1983). But these are films that have a kinetic and psychological power that very few other 'horror' or 'thriller' films of this kind can have without spiraling into hyper-violent absurdity, and they are films that DeMonaco clearly has learned a lot from.Hawke does a fairly good job of being a somewhat callous capitalist who grossly underrates the impact that the violent behavior of the night of the Purge will have on his family. Headey also does a credible job as his wife, who questions his motivations and his morality when, at first, he decides to hand Hodge over to Wakefield, instead of doing the right thing and fighting for his humanity. In the final analysis, and in terms of its credibility and plausibility, THE PURGE isn't necessarily the best psychological 'horror' or 'thriller' film that has ever been. But it is effective enough to deliver what it promises for its eighty-five minute running time.",7,0,0,10 June 2013
Munich," What Price Vengeance?
","Steven Spielberg's huge popularity means that he is frequently the target of critics, whether it is for shouldering the blame for the Hollywood 'blockbuster' trend that started with JAWS, for alleged audience manipulation (as in E.T.), or for the more weighty issues behind SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. But nowhere does it seem that criticism has been as fierce as it is with MUNICH. Here he is, the most popular filmmaker in Hollywood, tackling the subjects of terrorism and vengeance with the same consummate skill he tackled with sharks, the Holocaust, and aliens--and here are people slamming him not only for doing so, but for doing so in a way they don't agree with. Why is this? For starters, as the title indicates, he uses as a focal point the murders of eleven Israeli athletes by members of the ultra-violent Palestinian terrorist group Black September at the Summer Olympics in Munich on September 5, 1972, and the response by Israel. Eric Bana is one of five Israeli Mossad agents sent to track down eleven high-ranking Palestinians who are believed to have had a hand in planning the Munich massacre. The purpose of the mission is to send a message once and for all to the Palestinians that Israel will not be intimidated into ceasing to exist as a country. The team goes about their business throughout Europe, though their operations are not the most perfect (which is so often the case in missions of this sort), and are always bloody. Very soon, however, they learn of other Palestinian terrorist acts, including the hijacking of a Lufthansa jet in Germany, and they find themselves not only being the hunters but also being the hunted and the haunted as well. Near the end, after he has moved to New York, Bana openly wonders to his superior (Geoffrey Rush, in an incredibly direct performance) whether they really got the exact ones who plotted the Munich tragedy. It is a question that remains open-ended, as the film ends with a view across the Hudson River to Manhattan and the twin towers of the World Trade Center.No film about real-life acts of political terrorism will ever satisfy everybody, but Spielberg has come in for some extreme attacks. On the one side are those who criticize his stand as being too pro-Israeli; and on the other are those who feel he gives too much credence to the Palestinian terrorists. The fact is, of course, being Jewish, he is hardly going to go against the state of Israel on anything. But he also sees the troubling ambiguity of the aftermath of Munich in relation to the decades-long Israel/Palestinian conflict and, with respect to what Israel did to avenge Munich, he asks the question: 'What price vengeance?' How can a mission like the one Bana and his fellow Israelis undertake ever fully satisfy the need for vengeance for Munich without costing a huge price, in terms of human lives lost, and in human souls that are destroyed in the continuous cycle of bloody revenge killings? These are very troubling questions, and I think this is why certain people with extremist views are attacking Spielberg for MUNICH, even with its superb ensemble acting, taut editing, and compelling storyline. A lot of people don't want to deal with that painful reality; nor do they want to deal with the fact that the world doesn't work on a black-and-white/good-guys-and-bad guys level. Spielberg knows the world doesn't operate like that. And the film's final shot of the World Trade towers clearly states that the questions of vengeance and retribution are now being directed at his own country with respect to its war on terrorism, motivated by revenge for 9/11 and the price *that* war is taking on American lives and the soul of the nation.The consummate skill that Spielberg, his crew, and his cast put into making MUNICH work is what I think will outlast the attacks against the film. This is a film that is a must-see for all those who really care about where our world is headed, and how we deal with the always troubling subject of terrorism.",10,4,7,15 January 2006
Thirteen Days," On The Brink Of Nuclear Armageddon
","Based on that period known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, THIRTEEN DAYS is a brilliantly crafted and well-acted political drama that reminds us of just how close we were in October 1962 to the brink of a nuclear Armageddon.When faced with incontrovertible photographic evidence that the Soviets have placed strategic nuclear missiles in Cuba and aimed them right at many East Coast cities, including Washington, President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) is faced with decisions and options of enormous and staggering proportions, all of which could determine the existence of the planet. He, his brother Bobby (Steven Culp) and trusted friend Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), have to balance the possibility of losing politically if they cave in to the Soviets or setting off World War III if they act too aggressively.The result is one of the best historical and political dramas seen in some time; and the fact that it's based on actual events, albeit slightly fictionalized in the transfer to film, makes THIRTEEN DAYS all that much more powerful.Although the heavy Irish-Americans accents of the three leads may be a little distracting, Costner, Greenwood, and Culp do very fine jobs with their roles. The direction of Roger Donaldson (NO WAY OUT) and the screenplay by David Self (THE ROAD TO PERDITION) are both intelligent enough so that even those who don't remember the Cuban Missile Crisis too clearly or who were born too late to see it as only a footnote in history books will be both spellbound and want to read more about this unique and chilling period in the history of the world. Among the other great things about this film is Michael Fairman's great portrayal of UN ambassador (and former presidential candidate) Adlai Stevenson. His showdown with his Soviet counterpart at the UN General Assembly is a classic moment in recent film history.For those who like politically-charged films like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, THIRTEEN DAYS is the ticket. Even if political dramas are not your thing, this film should still be seen for the great acting and the story that is on display.",10,0,0,2 September 2002
Apollo 13," 'Houston, we have a problem.' This film DOESN'T.
","One of the most successful film of the 90s was this stunning recreation of the near-tragic flight of Apollo 13 to the Moon in April 1970.Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert were 200,000 miles from Earth at 9:15 PM on April 13, 1970 when an oxygen tank in their service module suffered an electrical short, ruptured, and exploded.  Two of their ship's three fuel cells were gone, their entire navigational system was thrown into a tailspin, and their life support was rapidly fading.  It was bad enough that their planned moon landing was scrubbed, but it was even worse to consider the strong possibility that they might not get home alive.  But with the help of all the brave people at Mission Control, this most perilous flight in the history of manned space travel ended happily with a successful splashdown in the South Pacific on April 17.Director Ron Howard (BACKDRAFT) recreates this true story with such technical and dramatic precision that APOLLO 13 is nothing short of a masterpiece, ranking it right up there with other such films as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, THE RIGHT STUFF and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.  Tom Hanks (as always), Bill Paxton, and Kevin Bacon give great performances as Apollo 13's crew.  Gary Sinise also scores as Ken Mattingly, who was to be the ship's command module pilot before a feared measles infection (which never materialized) beached him.  Kathleen Quinlan is good as Hanks' wife, and Ed Harris gives a very steely performance as Gene Kranz, the chief of Mission Control who urges his men on to find solutions to the complex problems that eventually came to surround this mission.Featuring an excellent score by James Horner, in the Copland tradition, APOLLO 13 won justly-deserved Oscars for sound and film editing.  Not to be missed, especially for those space travel enthusiasts out there.",10,1,1,18 July 2001
Moon," Industrial Malfeasance On The Dark Side Of The MOON
","If there is one thing that has become fairly pervasive in 21st century Hollywood filmmaking, it is the proliferation of films whose main attraction are compute-generated images (CGI). This can be seen in the enormous proliferation of comic book spectacles such as THE AVENGERS, THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN, and IRON MAN, as well as 'apocalyptic' films like THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, GEOSTORM, and '2012'. But the 21st century has also seen a fairly huge number of films that verge more on hard and realistic science fiction concepts. This particular sub-genre was likely started by director Stanley Kubrick and his groundbreaking 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and continued on into the mid-1990s by Ron Howard's brilliant 1995 saga APOLLO 13 (recreating the saga of that almost-doomed 1970 lunar flight). And on occasions we have seen how science fiction can be done on relatively spare budgets, but somehow not stinting on credibility. This was the case with the 2009 film MOON, a combination of science fiction and psychological thriller components that was the directing debut for the British-born Duncan Jones.In MOON, Sam Rockwell portrays a lunar mining engineer on a three-year contract for Lunar Industries, supplying fusion energy to an energy-depleted population back on Earth via helium and solar wind collection on the dark side of the Moon. His efforts, and those of his employers, have reduced the carbon footprint of Earth's atmosphere by close to seventy percent. But the three years of being at that base totally alone are taking their toll on Rockwell, given how absolutely homesick he is for his wife and family. His only real companion is a robotic computer (oddly) named Gerty (voice of Kevin Spacey); and absent a 'real' human voice, Rockwell seems to be slowly sinking into paranoia. An accident with the lunar harvesters leaves him in a coma for several days during the final weeks of his tour of duty. But when he comes to, he finds to his shock a clone in the process of doing all his chores; and his paranoia and madness increase further. In an effort to find out more, Rockwell and his clone, along with a little bit of help from Gerty, find a storage area where there are, in fact, literally hundreds of clones of Rockwell, ready for operation if the 'real' Rockwell ever got into an accident on the lunar surface (which he, of course, did); it was done as a cost-cutting operation on the part of Lunar Industries to ensure that the production of fusion energy not stop, even if Rockwell did. This will set up a showdown at the end once Rockwell is taken back to Earth.Jones, the son of the late British rock icon David Bowie (whose 1969 hit 'Space Oddity', after having been a British smash at the time of Apollo 11's landing on the Moon, became a belated U.S. hit in 1973, and jump-started his career), had a mere $5 million or so to toy with in the making of MOON, which was based on a story of his and scripted by Parker, a close friend of his. But much in the same way that Douglas Trumbull made a slim $1.2 million budget go a long way with his 1972 cult classic SILENT RUNNING, so too does Jones with MOON. And while it may be true that Jones' film takes its cue from a lot of science fiction films of previous decades, at least one can say that Jones borrowed from the better ones. Because Rockwell is virtually the only live 'human' character in the film, his character functions very much the same way Bruce Dern did in SILENT RUNNING, as a caretaker of a vast resource that will prove beneficial to Earth. And of course, Spacey voicing the computer Gerty has its roots in Douglas Rain's voice of HAL 9000 in both '2001' and its much-underrated 1984 sequel '2010'. MOON also ingeniously utilizes elements of such films as ALIEN, CAPRICORN ONE, and OUTLAND in its side plot of corporate malfeasance endangering its employees. The film is also helped out by a very good modernistic score by Clint Mansell, whose credits include '11:14', THE FOUNTAIN, and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM.While MOON is not necessarily the fastest-paced film ever made, and the idea of Rockwell being on the screen all by himself for extended periods of time may not be everyone's cup of tea, Jones nevertheless makes the setting of the film, and its depictions of the desolate lunar landscape and of space itself extremely convincing on a budget that would normally not pay even for just one set piece of most Hollywood blockbusters. The final verdict is that MOON should be counted at the very least as a minor gem of a genre, science fiction, that might seem passé (but emphatically is not) in the 21st century.MOON gets an '8' rating here.",8,0,0,12 May 2018
Born on the Fourth of July," Debunking a lot of dangerous myths
","In PLATOON, director Oliver Stone gave us a look at the Vietnam war from ground zero.  And in BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, he gives us another man's view of the war, like Stone a soldier who had become disenfranchised by the war.The man at the center of this true-life story is Ron Kovic, a Marine who believed in the myths of American might, the honor of serving one's country, John Wayne, and the threat that communism posed.  But in a firefight on a Vietnamese beach during Tet, Kovic was shot by a VC bullet and paralysed from the waist down.  As a result, he would never be able to walk again and would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.  Even worse, when he returned from Vietnam, his rehabilitation was painful, and so was his coming to terms with the fact that many of his friends in his hometown of Massapequa, New York had grown either indifferent or hostile to him. Once a love-it-or-leave-it patriot, Kovic came to realize he could be a force for Good by protesting what the Vietnam war had done, not only to his fellow servicemen but to America.This is what is at the heart of BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and Stone (with help from Kovic, who collaborated with the director on the screenplay, which was based on his 1976 memoir) brings all the memories back of those traumatic years in American history.  Tom Cruise gives a fine performance as Kovic.Even more so, Stone does the right thing by debunking a lot of dangerous myths about America's anti-communist paranoia and our worshipping of John Wayne.  Unlike a previous reviewer of this film, I am of the belief that America never fully understood communism as anything more than a threat to itself, and our inability to see beyond that surface to its inherent weaknesses is what led us to the utter tragedy of Vietnam.  Furthermore, basing our patriotism on an actor like John Wayne, who NEVER served his country in reality, also turned out to be part of the recipe for disaster.BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, in my opinion, is NOT an Anti-American film but a film fundamentally about the loss of human innocence.  It does not make service to one's country dishonorable.  But it does rightly destroy those myths that destroyed our innocence as a nation in the 1960s and 1970s.  And on those counts alone, it is an American masterpiece.",9,2,3,31 July 2001
The Social Network," Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook, A Billion 'Friends', And A Few Enemies
","Of all the Internet social platforms that have ever existed, Facebook is, and unless something better comes alone, will likely remain the best known. Initially a platform conceived by Mark Zuckerberg on the campus of Harvard University in 2004, Facebook was then later expanded to other Boston area institutions of higher learning, plus other Ivy League schools, and then to Stanford Univeristy, the latter which is, not coincidentally, located within driving distance of Silicon Valley. Zuckerberg founded the site with roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes; but as is the case with more than a few projects of this kind, Zuckerberg's ego got the best of him, and got him more than a few enemies in the process. This great saga of the Internet became the subject of the 2010 film THE SOCIAL NETWORK.Based on Ben Mezrich's book 'The Accidental Billionaires', directed by David Fincher (FIGHT CLUB), and scripted by Aaron Sorkin (of A FEW GOOD MEN and 'West Wing' fame), THE SOCIAL NETWORK stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg, who, along with his friend Severin (Andrew Garfield), Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzello), and Hughes (Patrick Mapel), came up with the social networking site that started life with a somewhat grotesque name called 'Facesnash', Eisenberg later changes the name to Facebook via a suggestion made by high-tech Silicon Valley hustler Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). But those efforts come to enrage the Winklevoss Brothers (Armie Hammer; Josh Pence), who had come up with the idea that may have inspired Zuckerberg's moves. And then later, other moves that Eisenberg makes on his own enrage the guys who helped him start it, resulting in the young Internet genius getting himself into legal hot water. And, as we have seen of late, it wouldn't exactly be the last time both Facebook and its creator would end up in hot water, both legally and politically.With numerous flashback and flash-forward sequences detailing the rise of Facebook and the legal entanglements that Eisenberg must go through, many of which were of his own making, THE SOCIAL NETWORK is noted for a huge amount of expository dialogue that, as is the case with more than a few films done from Sorkin's screenplays, is delivered in rapid fire and often blackly comic fashion. But the overall impression, layered in with a great neo-futuristic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, is one of a feeling of uber-superiority on the part of Zuckerberg getting the best of him, and in the process, even as Facebook gains a billion-plus 'friends' (as of 2018), making enemies for himself, mostly unnecessarily. And, as is the case with films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and WESTWORLD, to name just two, THE SOCIAL NETWORK is also about the rapid pace of technology outpacing our ability both to deal with it and not allow us to be thoroughly immersed in it. Eisenberg does a good turn as the resident genius Mark Zuckerberg, as do a lot of the other, mostly younger, actors in this epic film that will, in the future, be seen as a portrait of the world that was shaped in the first ten to twelve years of the 21st century.",8,1,2,21 May 2018
The Birds," Hitchcock in full flight and fright
","Following up an undisputed horror masterpiece like PSYCHO would have been a very hard bargain for almost every other director, but Alfred Hitchcock was not like 'every other director.'  THE BIRDS was the result; and while its special effects aren't up to snuff when compared to the CGIs we've got today, one should keep in mind that THE BIRDS is an early 1960s product.Although sometimes labeled as science fiction, THE BIRDS offers no explanation, scientific or otherwise, for why Bodega Bay, California and its residents and visitors should be besieged by half the avian kingdom.  The performances, particularly by Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren, sometimes seem very distant--which is not to say they're bad, quite the contrary.  But it does produce an emotional and psychological chill that hadn't been seen in the horror genre before.It is also clear that, despite its age, THE BIRDS has worn rather well as a movie and continues to be hugely influential.  The nighttime sieges at Taylor's house seemed to have influenced that aspect of George Romero's 1968 cult film NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  And certainly this film's influence is clearly felt by Steven Spielberg, whose great suspense thrillers DUEL and JAWS pay homage to the Hitchcock aesthetic.Thus, it should come as no surprise that I rate THE BIRDS a clear 10.",10,1,1,8 August 2001
Sully," Human Heroism Done Right
","It was an aviation event the likes of which few, if any, in the world could ever recall happening. On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549, bound from New York's LaGuardia International Airport to Charlotte, North Carolina, was hit by a large flock of birds just thirty seconds after takeoff. The bird strike disabled and damaged both of the jet's engines; and though it managed to keep flight for another three minutes, there was no way it could return to LaGuardia, or make any attempts at an emergency landing at either JFK, Newark, or nearby Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. The flight's captain, Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, made the split-second decision to ditch the aircraft in the Hudson River, rather than risk flying into any buildings. Incredibly, the aircraft, though damaged by the bird strikes and the water landing, stayed afloat long enough for rescue personnel to save the lives of all 155 people on that flight, an operation that took only twenty-four minutes in all. The incident has been into the highly engaging cinematic docudrama SULLY.Based on the book 'Highest Duty' by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow, the film, as directed by Clint Eastwood (who some time back traded his acting career for one focused solely on direction, though he had been doing both on and off since 1971's PLAY MISTY FOR ME), focuses in on the pressures that Sullenberger, excellently played by Tom Hanks (as always), underwent in the months following the crash. The media attention was enormous, but it was also highly scrutinizing as well. And in those months, Sullenberger and his co-pilot Jeffrey Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) went before a seemingly endless battery of hearings conducted by both the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transpiration Safety Board as to whether Sullenberger's judgment on that day was sound, given that flight simulations supposedly had shown that the plane could have accomplished either one of the four scenarios (return to LaGuardia; landing at JFK; Newark; or Teterboro) while achieving the same result that Hanks and Eckhart had achieved. But in the testimony the two men give, Hanks argues that the basic human element was totally left out of those scenarios. From the moment the bird strikes happened until US Airways 1549 ditched into the Hudson River, there were only 208 seconds (three minutes and twenty-eight seconds); and in that time, trying to fly the disabled craft onto a dry runway was totally unrealistic and could have resulted in the deaths of all onboard and even more on the ground.Since restaging the actual saga of Flight 1549 would be a matter of getting all the details right, helped out by Sullenberger's own book and his four decades worth of flight experience, it was really up to Eastwood's direction, and Hanks' ability to underplay, to get into the mindset of 'Sully' as he dealt with all the media and government attention that he, his wife (Laura Linney), and Eckhart went through in those months following what the media had deemed the 'Miracle On The Hudson.' Hanks deftly shows the struggles that Sullenberger faced, via flashbacks to that cold wintry day in the skies over the Big Apple, with respect to what he could have done differently (or what both the media and the government investigators think he could have done differently). But at no time during the actual FAA/NTSB hearings did Sully ever lose his cool and his composure. He merely pointed out that the human element needed to be taken into consideration, not just what some alternate computer simulation said could have been done, to facilitate the saving of everyone on Flight 1549; and the playback of the flight voice recorders clears up any questions as to the judgment and veracity behind Sully's decisions.That this saga, which, like 1995's APOLLO 13 (which also starred Hanks) and 2015's THE 33, had a hugely successful outcome, should have been made into a movie probably shouldn't surprise anyone. But just as importantly, and also just like those films, SULLY, thanks to Hanks' usual great Everyman portrayal of Sullenberger, the kind of heroism on display is that of common people, including Hanks, his crew, his wife, the passengers, and the rescue personnel of New York City, and not just some comic-book, super-patriotic depiction of heroism that too much of Hollywood has been about in the 21st century. Nothing about the saga of US Airways Flight 1549, or the resulting Miracle On The Hudson, was cut-and-dried; it was reality, and Eastwood and Hanks should both be commended for making it that way, and successfully so.",10,59,90,9 September 2016
Jurassic Park," Past, present, and future collide on Isla Nublar
","After pretty much hitting the bottom with HOOK, Steven Spielberg bounced back in 1993 with the double-barrel triumph of JURASSIC PARK and SCHINDLER'S LIST.  JURASSIC PARK would become only the second film to gross over a billion dollars (E.T., another Spielberg film, had passsed the mark prior to JURASSIC PARK's release), and win three Oscars in the technical fields (sound, sound effects editing, special effects).Spielberg collaborated with sci-fi writer Michael Crichton for this amazing and suspenseful look at how an ambitious billionaire (Richard Attenborough) finds a way to clone dinosaurs from fossilized DNA and turn this discovery into a reason for an island amusement park 200 miles off of Costa Rica. The problem, however, is what noted paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill) points out: because dinosaurs and Man have been separated by sixty-five million years of evolution and are now suddenly living together, 'How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?'Pretty much everything, is the answer, as Grant, paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and Attenborough's two grandkids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards) find themselves at the mercy of the dinosaurs when park security systems are shut off by the park's computer specialist (Wayne Knight) as he tries to smuggle dinosaur embryos off the island.  Not all the dinosaurs are to be feared, of course; but then, there's also T-Rex and Velociraptor to contend with.The 'PG-13' rating attached to JURASSIC PARK is very appropriate; there is intense suspense and brief graphic violence within.  But neither this film nor its two (so far) sequels are violent monster bloodbaths.  Neill and Dern are excellent in their roles, as is Jeff Goldblum in his role as chaos theorist Ian Malcolm.  John Williams' now-classic score seals the deal for JURASSIC PARK.",10,1,3,30 July 2001
All the President's Men," Just follow the money
","Lengthy and full of details but nevertheless one of the greatest movies ever made, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN still manages to work even twenty-five years after its release.As we all know, this film revolves around the efforts of Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Redford) of the Washington Post to get at the truth behind that little 'third-rate burglary' that happened at the Watergate building in the early morning hours of June 17, 1972.  Bit by little bit, a disturbing puzzle forms.  With some assistance from Redford's shadowy secret source known as Deep Throat (Holbrook), who tells Redford 'Just follow the money', the two men find a trail of lies, threats, electronic surveillance, and other forms of political chicanery that lead right to the Executive Office Building of the White House, whose occupant of course was Richard M. Nixon.Watergate, as they were to find out, was only part of a vast conspiracy within the entire U.S. intelligence community to sabotage not only the Democrats during the '72 election but to also crush ANY opposition of ANY kind to Nixon.  Once this whole thing was unraveled, it led to Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, the first time a president ever stepped down in disgrace (and, if we're lucky, the last).ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a combination of political drama and character study that remains compulsively watchable to this day.  Jason Robards won a justly-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar as the Post's avuncular editor Ben Bradlee, and William Goldman won Best Adapted Screenplay.  Also featured here in extremely effective roles are Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Robert Walden, and Ned Beatty.  The fine direction of Alan J. Pakula (KLUTE) is the icing on the cake.For a follow-up to this story, look for THE FINAL DAYS, a 2 1/2 hour TV movie based on the second Watergate book by 'Woodstein' that looks at Nixon's tumultuous collapse of power prior to his resignation.  In the meantime, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN ranks a solid and unequivoal 10.",10,1,1,17 July 2001
The Martian," Saving Mark Watney
","For all the hype about CGI, and such things as 'Real' 3-D, or IMAX 3-D, the fact is that Hollywood is throwing in a lot of ultra-expensive special effects and gimmicks to lure patrons into theaters as incentives to watch movies costing anywhere from $150 million to $200 million that are so much about the sonic and visual experience exclusively, and so precious little about the art form of the motion picture itself—primarily comic-book spectacles, and ultra-violent action. But there are still directors who like to do things differently. One of them is British director Ridley Scott. Known for such masterworks as ALIEN, BLADE RUNNER, GLADIATOR, and, in 2012, the Alien-influenced sci-fi/horror epic PROMETHEUS, Scott returned to the science fiction genre in 2015 with a film that is full of eye-popping visuals and sonic experiences, but rooted in realism. That film was THE MARTIAN.Based on the novel of the same name by Andy Weir, this film, which is a far-into-the-future science fiction opus in the manner of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (one of the films that Scott always considered a touchstone film), focuses on a manned expedition on the surface of Mars that goes horribly wrong for those involved when a severe Martian sandstorm envelops them. In a panic to leave, they unwittingly one of their own, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) behind on the Martian surface. The crew (led by Jessica Chastain) believe him to be dead, as does practically everyone at NASA, including its chairman (Jeff Daniels); but in fact, he is managing to survive on his expertise as a botanist and grow his own potatoes inside the sealed space lab on the surface of a planet where nothing can really grow naturally. Chastain and her crew only find out about this just as their spacecraft is making it home to Earth; and Daniels, a mission specialist (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and a British technician (Sean Bean) have to fast design a new mission for Chastain, Michael Pena, and their compatriots to quickly swing back to Mars for an incredibly dangerous rescue mission. Damon's knowledge of botany, and his somewhat caustic wit, are what manage to keep him reasonably sane through all of the difficulties; but at some point, luck will run out on him.As the bar for realism in terms of space flight and space exploration had been set by '2001', where both director Stanley Kubrick and legendary writer Arthur C. Clarke were in close contact with NASA, and was extended with films like that film's 1984 sequel '2010', 1995's APOLLO 13, 2013's GRAVITY, and 2014's INTERSTELLAR, Scott found it worth his while to follow in their footsteps when it came to The Martian. And although some slight inaccuracies were inevitable (Hollywood has a tendency to exaggerate reality for visual spectacle), in general, Scott shows an otherwise extremely high accuracy and attention to detail as Kubrick, one of his personal favorites and mentors, had done for his 1968 sci-fi masterpiece. And as with all good serious science fiction films, from '2001' onwards, the technology doesn't overshadow the characters or the plot; it is all in service of the story, as opposed to the other way around. Damon, of course, in his own sardonic way, is really good in his own sardonic way, as is Chastain (who was in INTERSTELLAR), Ejiofor, Daniels, and Pena. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams, who did the score for GLADIATOR, has an appropriate amount of futurism to it, as well as some moments of pure classical music and modern minimalism, to give the appropriate amount of tension (as well as lighter moments that use 1970s disco music, including Vicki Sue Robinson's 'Turn The Beat Around', Abba's 'Waterloo', and the O'Jays' 'Love Train').The vastness of the cosmos, as well as the red deserts and mountains that constitute the surface of Mars itself, are all vividly rendered by Scott, cinematographer Darius Wolski, and the visual effects team assembled for the project. With its combination of visual accuracy and stellar acting, THE MARTIAN joins GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR as a pre-eminent example of how great science fiction movies can still be made at a time when Hollywood has eschewed visual spectacle for visual reality, and sonic assaults for story immersion. Scott is one of those veteran directors who has shown that it need not be any other way.",10,4,18,6 October 2015
