The Avengers," Suit Up, This Is The Best Superhero Movie Ever Made.
","My friend took me to see the most hyped movie of the year and I have to say as a fan of superhero movies this is the best one by far.The film is about Nick Fury played by Samuel L Jackson who wants to assemble an army of 'Avengers' Consisting of Iron Man played by Robert Downy Jr, The Hulk played by Mark Ruffalo, Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson, Captain America played by Chris Evans, Thor played by Chris Hemsworth and Hawkeye played by Jeremy Renner who have to take out Loki Thor's Brother played by Tom Hiddleston from destroying the world with a device known as The Tesseract.This was such a great movie. The action was fantastic, has great special effects, Really funny moments like the guy playing Galaga on the job(if you have seen the movie then you know what I'm talking about), a fantastic Third act which some of the movie was shot in my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, There is a Cameo by Stan Lee at the end of the movie. and the only superhero movie I know that has a reference to Marijuana in it. The only complaint was that it felt like a 3 1/2 hour movie, but since the movie was that good I can let it slip. If you do not see this in Theaters than you have no personality.Rated PG-13 For Intense Sequences Of Sci-Fi Violence And Action Throughout, And A Mild Drug Reference.2hrs 22min/142min.****/****",10,11,22,5 May 2012

Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Toons. Gets 'Em Every Time.
","Warning: there will be spoilers. So the film starts out in 1947,oddly enough on a cartoon staring Roger Rabbit voiced by Charles Flesicher and Baby Herman voiced by Lou Hirsh. We find out when the filming for the cartoon ends that Roger just can't get his lines right and is kicked off of the set, Much to the onlooking eyes of private detective Eddie Valiant played by Bob Hoskins.Eddie later gets a case that will pay for his very large bar tab by his boss R.K.

Marvin had a safe dropped on his head and the paint from Rogers glove is on the rope. After meeting with Judge Doom played by Christopher Lloyd who can actually kill toons by dropping them in 'Dip', Eddie goes back to his apartment to find Baby Herman There. Bbay Herman tells Eddie that Marvin Acme had a will entitling ToonTown to the toons, but nobody can find it.The next day Roger appears in Eddies office because he is a wanted man. The Toon patrol which is a group of 5 weasels come to Eddies house looking for the Rabbit.After causing a mishap at a bar Roger and Eddie go to a movie theater and Eddie reveals that his brother Teddy was killed by a toon dropping a piano on hi head.

Spice World," A Guilty Pleasure.
","I have heard nothing but negative things for this movie. But A friend of mine on YouTube named Cinema Sickness recommended this movie. So I bought it for a whopping 25 cents and here are my thoughts.The film is just about the 5 Spice Girls who try to help their friend deliver her first baby all while they are trying to get ready for a very big live performance.This is pretty stupid but you know what I had a lot of fun with it. If you are taking this movie to seriously well than you are not going to have any fun with any other movie. Although it is a very strange idea to make a movie about the Spice Girls. But Hey they made a movie about Hannah Montana and Justin Bieber so anything is possible.Plus I think that this movie is a little to risquÃ© for a PG Rating.

Batman Returns," I Am Catwoman, Hear Me Roar!
","Director Tim Burton Gives us a very Violent Batman sequel With Batman Returns.After the success of Batman in 1989 Tim Burton was signed on to do a sequel. He was given full range to make whatever he wanted. So he did what he usually does twisted and imaginary film style.The film is about Bruce Wayne played again by Micheal Keaton who is discovering that now that he has defeated the Joker he has grown in more popularity.This time the film has 3 villains.The first villain is Max Shreck played by Christopher Walken an evil billionaire tycoon who wants Gotham City and all the popularity and publicity for himself.The second villain is Selina Kyle played by Michelle Pfeiffer who is thrown out of a window by Max and becomes Catwomn By(and I am not kidding you)being chewed on by cats. She wants to destroy Batman and claim he is the villain in all of this.The third and final villain is Oswald Cobblepot played by Danny DeVito who was abandoned by his mother and father and raised by penguins. For the rest of the movie they call him The Penguin. He wants to become the mayor of Gotham city. And by the way The Penguin is not a person who wants to become evil just for the hell of it he is just a sad and confused misfit who wants to fit in with society and everyone around him.This film is way more violent than the first but still has a very interesting story talented cast and is very entertaining. Fun Fact Mcdonalds was all set to do a happy meal line for the movie but canceled it because the movie was to violent. I can;t disagree because I can't even believe this got slapped with a PG-13 rating.

But then comes along a much more serious film in the series that was intended to start the whole franchise over with a new director Christopher Nolan who wanted intentions to start the franchise over.The film is about Batman/BruceWayne now played by Christian Bale who after his parents got killed wants to train to become a superhero to Gotham City. This training goes on for half of the movie. The second half is about him going after 2 villains Rhas Al Guhl played by Liam Neeson who goes by the name of Henry Ducard to hide his identity. The second villain is Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow played by Cillian Murphy who sprays people with a fear gas.This is a nice addition to the series but is too long And it drags but I still enjoy it enough to recommend it.Rated PG-13 For Intense Action Violence, Disturbing Images And Some Thematic Elements.2hrs 20min/140min.***/****",Null,0,1,8 November 2011
Bridesmaids," Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.
",Lately over the years I have noticed that action and horror movies are getting The PG-13 rating and comedies are pushing The R rating and frankly most of them are pretty bad. But I just came across one film that lived up to it's hype and made it worth my time. That movie is Bridesmaids.The film stars Kristen Wiig who plays Annie who is really depressed that her bakery shop Cake Baby has gone bankrupt and she has lost all of her money and has to move in with two people who are obnoxious and annoying. Thing get on the bright side with Annie when her best friend Lillian played by Maya Rudolph announces that she is getting married and wants Annie to be her Maid of honor. But things Get in Annies way when a fellow bridesmaid Helen played by Rose Byrne Steals every idea that Annie has come up with and took for her own.This is a very fun film but in my opinion this was a little over hyped. One thing that got on my nerves was the scene where Annie And Helen trade off Microphones. It just went on to long. All in all a fantastic movie to watch.Rated R For Some Strong Sexuality And Language Throughout.Thetrical: 2hrs 5min/125min. Unrated; 2hrs 11min/131min.Theatrical: 27 uses of the F-word.

Django Unchained," The D Is Silent(****Out Of****).
","Quentin Tarantino is my all-time favorite director. He makes very unique films like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds. He has come out with another film which is now tied with End Of Watch as being the best film of the year. Now I don't have to like everything Quentin Tarantino but every thing I have seen of him but I have seen everything he has done and they are all fantastic including this one.The film starts in 1858, 2 years before the civil war, with Dr. King Schultz played by Christoph Waltz who comes across a group of slaves and requires the help of one. That happens to be Django played by Jamie Foxx. Shultz is a bounty hunter and needs the help of Django to find The Brittle Brothers who had kidnapped Django's wife and took her away. They soon find and kill The Britlle Brothers(Not a spoiler because this happens 40 minutes into the movie) and find out that Django's Wife Broomhilda played by Kerry Washington has been taken to a plantation known as Candyland run by Calvin Candie played by Leonardo DiCaprio.Calvin and Shultz negotiate at dinner the selling of a slave fighter but Calvin's assistant Stephen played by Samuel L. Jackson notices that Django and Broomhilda seem to know each other. Calvin then sells Broomhilda to Shultz and Django after threatening to kill Broomhilda. (Spoilers Ahead. Skip to the next paragraph if you have not seen this film which shame on you, you should see it.) Shultz then shoots and kills Candie after Candie's behavior and then a brutal and bloody shootout which results in the death of Schultz. Django Then ,with Broomhilda, go back to the plantation and kill the remaining betrayers and blows Calvins house to smithereens as Django and Broomhilda Ride off into the night.There is a scene in Django Unchained Where Django executes a bloody shootout and when I say Bloody, I mean so gruesome that I am surprised that this got away with an R Rating but I am glad it did so I could see it. This shooting is not realistic but it is so good and a pivotal scene in the film and it is awesome.The film has great acting. I hope Jamie Foxx gets nominated for Best Actor and not 1, but 3 people going for Best Supporting Actor, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. Kerry Washington for best Actress. Everybody in this film does a great job and this is some of the best acting I have seen in a film.The music is fantastic with the original Django theme in the opening credits. While I really do not like, sorry, hate rap, I think the rap music fits very well into the film. The theme of Spaghetti Western music is great.The story is awesome. I love the time period it is set in and it shows you a movie can be good if it is not set in modern times or in the future. The film also has beautiful set locations and Tarantino did a fantastic job recreating a western location.A warning to the squeamish, this film has harsh usage of the N word, although it is scary for the time period this film is set in, and has a ton of blood and is very gruesome. If you do not like the sight of that then you might want to sit this film out but do not let that stop you from seeing this film.I am introducing a new thing called The Drinking Game where you take a drink every time something repetitive happens, although thats not bad for this film.. Take a drink Whenever some uses the N word(121 times).The final verdict for Django Unchained is 4 Out Of 4 Stars with My Seal Of Approval. Awesome story and acting, great music, nice set locations and stylized glorified violence with great character development. See this film do whatever you can to see this movie. This movie may be 3 hours long but is entertaining every single second. Although do not take a 9 year old to see it. Thats what happened at my theater.Rated R For Strong Graphic Violence Throughout, A Vicious Fight, Language And Some Nudity.2hrs 45min/165min.39 uses of the F-word.121 uses of the N-word.****/****",10,3,11,5 January 2013
Kick-Ass," The Anti Superhero Film(**** Out Of ****)
","Kick-Ass is a unique film. It is a film that definitely falls under the 'Take-No-Prisoners' category. The film is brutal and vulgar and it is deliciously demented. Kick-Ass is a brilliant comic book written by Mark Millar, and yes, there are differences between the comic book and film, but I don't go into a movie adapted from source material and nitpick if one character didn't do something he did in the book. However I do pay attention to see if it lives up to the book. Films like 'Percy Jackson And The Olympians The Lightning Thief' and 'Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker' are terrible adaptations of the original source material. Kick-Ass is one of the films that follows the book but makes changes, for a reason. If everything in the novel was in the film, than it would have been rated NC-17, which is the stamp of death for movies.The films follows Dave Lizewski played by Aaron Johnson is pondering the age-old question: How come nobody wants to be a Superhero? After the crime rate has gone up in his city he decides he wants to dress up like a superhero and take down some thugs. However, his first encounter does not go so well as he is stabbed and hit by a car. Miraculously, he survives and decides to have another go at it. He launches into worldwide fame after a video is posted online of him beating up 3 thugs, goes viral. He goes to do another job but the plan goes awry when the gang member gets the upper hand. He is then helped by Hit-Girl played by Chloe Grace Mortez and her father Big Daddy played by Nicholas Cage. The films villain Frank D'amico played by Mark Strong and his son Chris played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse devise a plan to kidnapped Kick-Ass by having Chris be a new Superhero named Red-Mist. The rest is for you to watch the film and find out for yourself.The films acting is very strong. Aaron Jonson is very good in his film debut as the title character. Chloe Grace Mortez is very good and vulgar in her debut as well. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is of course good as the sort of awkward kid who wants to make it big. Nicholas Cage is always great and fun to watch. He is especially hilarious as the gun toting nut Big Daddy.The story is different yet original. This is sort of the Anti Superhero movie. This film brings to light that Superheroes don't always win. I love it. It's a bold approach and it is different to see superheroes placed in more danger than the PG-13 cookie cutter comic book movies. I have nothing wrong with those movies but I would love to see something different.This film has two types of humor. The genuinely funny humor that happens from dialouge exchanges from characters, and the shocking humor. A perfect example is when Chloe Grace Mortez, who was 11 years old when filming is swearing all over the place with her saying lines like, 'Okay you C***s, lets see what you can do.' The character development is great and the characters of Big Daddy and Hit Girl have amazing back-stories. Hit Girl's mom died of a prescription drug overdose while her father was in prison. Big Daddy's motivation for going after Frank is that Frank put him in prison and left Hit Girl without a father for a few years. These characters have a motivation for getting their revenge.Laslty I want to advise a warning. This film is extremely brutal, vulgar and violent. The torture scene in the film is very brutal and hard to watch. I know this sounds crazy but the torture scene in the book is more brutal than the film. Also there is blood galore in this film but has the same amount or less amount of blood than in the book. They wanted to make this movie PG-13 but, honestly, it would not have worked. Also 80% of the violence is enacted by a child who is Chloe Grace Mortez. This may be hard to watch and that is understandable. Lastly there is a brief but painful scene where Hit Girl is getting strangled by Frank. By me awarding this film 4 stars, I am not promoting child violence or violence against children, as a matter of fact it sickens me, But this is a movie based off of a comic book. It is not realistic and It is heavily stylized. I understand if you find this material hard to watch, but lets be honest an 11 year old girl is not going to go on a murderous rampage. Roger Ebert famously gave the film 1 star out of 4 saying 'Should I be cool, or have a Heart?' I am not cool by rating the film 4 stars but I am being honest. So was Roger Ebert and I respect him for it.This film earns my 4 star rating. The acting is strong, the story is brilliant and the film is brutally fun and shockingly funny. Kick-Ass is a movie with brutality but heart. This is a comic book film not to be missed.Rated R For Strong Brutal Violence Throughout, Pervasive Language, Sexual Content, Nudity And Some Drug Use- Some Involving Children.1hr 57min/117min.112 uses of the F-word.****/****",10,4,5,8 January 2013

Moulin Rouge!," Hyper And Cluttered Film With Some Redeeming Factors
",This is a film that I have been hearing nothing but such great things about the famous movie Moulin Rouge so naturally I just had to check it out. But after watching it I am really starting to wonder if I saw the same movie.The film is about Christian played by Ewan MacGreggor who goes to a Broadway theater Known as Moulin Rouge. The Star Singer Satine played by Nicole Kidman who is the star the keeps everybody coming back. The two find themselves in madly in love(Trust me I should know because they say it every 5 seconds) and work together to save the theater from being demolished.This is a very poorly shot film. Whoever edited this must have been hopped up on Starbucks and Tic-Tacs because every shot lasts about 2-5 seconds. The Characters are very odd and very strange for a film set in 1899. Speaking of why is it that in a film that is set in 1899 do we have Christina Agulera songs? But All of the stuff done with Ewan MacGreggor and Nicole Kidman are very well done and are two wonderful singer. But that is not enough for me to like this film like everyone else.Rated PG-13 For Sexual Content.2hrs 8min/128min.**/****,5,0,1,30 November 2011

Pulp Fiction," And You Will Kow My Name Is The Lord When I Lay My Vengeance Upon Thee!
","Director Quentin Tarantino gives us a cinematic master piece with the film Pulp Fiction an anthology movie that is not told in chronological order which is what I think is a great idea to keep the audience on their toes to see what happens next.The first story titled Vincent Vega And Marcellus Wallaces' Wife follows Vincent Vega played by John Travolta who is told by Marcellus Wallus played by Ving Rhames to take care of his wife Mia Wallace played by Uma Thurman. They go to a 50's style restaurant titled Jack Rabbiit Slims where the famous twist contest happens. The story really escalates when Mia has a heroin overdose and has to have an adrenaline shot. Fun Fact: the scene with Vincent sticking the needle in Mia was done by having John Travota taking the needle out and running the film backwards because if he had actually jabbed it in He would have broken Uma Thurmans Ribs.The Second Story titled The Gold Watch is about famous boxer Butch Coolidge played by Bruce Willis who is supposed to throw a boxing match but does not and ends up killing his opponent. He and his girlfriend Fabienne played by Maria De Medeiors who are on the run by Marcellus Wallace. They eventually get kidnapped and get sexually assaulted by 2 psychos Zed played by Peter Greene and Maynard played by Duane Whitaker. Butch ends up stealing Zeds Chopper saying the famous line, Zeds Dead Baby, Zeds Dead. The Third And Final Story Titled The Bonnie Situation is about Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield played by Samuel L Jackson who end up killing their friend named Marvin played by Phil LaMarr and end up going to their friend Jimmies house played by Quenton Tarantino and get help from Winston Wolf played by Harvey Keitel to clean up the mess before Bonnie played by Pam Grier. They End up going to a diner which is being robbed by Pumpkin played by Tim Roth and Honey Bunny played by Amanda Plummer.

Scream," We All Go A Little Mad Sometimes.
","I am deciding to rewrite my reviews on the Scream franchise because I was not very satisfied with my original reviews. I really didn't express how much I loved these films. So I begin with the first film Scream.In the early to mid 90's, horror films were getting stale and people were not responding well to recent installments to Halloween, Friday The 13th and A Nightmare On Elm Street. In 1995 a young writer by the name of Kevin Williamson wrote a script for a film entitled Scary Movie. This script started a bidding war between different directors until Wes Craven decided to pick it up. The title was changed from Scary Movie to Scream.Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell is an aspiring girl who is just about ready to graduate High school with her friends. Her best friend is Tatum Riley played by Rose McGowan who is willing to take on anything that gets in her way. Then we have Randy Meeks played by Jamie Kennedy who is the big horror movie geek in the school. Stu Macher played by Matthew Lillard who is dating Tatum and is a big party goer. Finally there is Billy Loomis played by Skeet Ulrich Who is dating Sidney.One night Casey Becker played by Drew Barrymore gets murdered along with her boyfriend by a man wearing a Ghostface mask and the first on the scene is Gale Weathers played by Courtney Cox A reporter who will do anything to get the latest story and police officer Dewey Riley played by David Arquette who is shy and uncomfortable but has a big heart. After classes have been suspended for a few days Everybody heads to Stu's house for a party. One by one people get murdered including Tatum.Spoilers! After Sidney is attacked she finds out that Billy is the killer and Stu is his accomplice. Billy is driven By Maternal abandonment whereas Stu is driven to peer pressure. Stu dies from being electrocuted and Billy dies from being shot. The characters end there night by walking into the sunrise.This is a great horror film. The dialouge is well written because it is self aware. It knows it is making a mockery of horror flicks and has fun with it. The characters are nicely developed and the story is very original for a horror film.Rated R For Strong Graphic Horror Violence And Gore, And For Language.1hr 51min/111min.30 uses of the F-word.****/****",10,0,0,31 August 2012

","Day 9 Of My 31 Days Of Horror 2.So last night I finally sat down and checked out Thee Silence Of The Lambs. We are soon going to be watching this film in my high school's film club on October 29th. I wanted to see what everybody was talking about. I hear this film Quoted all the time and I know the famous Characters. So what did I think of the film? The film starts with Clarice Starling played by Jodie Foster as she is pulled from the training course and called to her boss Jack Craford's played by Scott Glenn office. She is told to go to the psychiatric ward to speak with Hannibal Lector played by Anthony Hopkins about the serial killer Buffalo Bill played by Ted Levine.She meets with Hannibal as he agrees to tell her information in exchange for memories from her unhappy childhood. As a child Clarice experienced Her father die in a hospital a month after an altercation with 2 burglars. She was then sent to live with her uncle on his farm. One day she tried to run away. As she was leaving she witnessed lambs getting slaughtered. She tried to save one but had to let it go because of it's weight.Hannibal eventually reveals that Buffalo Bills real name is Jame Gumb. His mother died at the age of 2 and started killing at 12 when he murdered his grandparents. Buffalo Bill has kidnapped Catherine Martin played by Brooke Smith who is the daughter of the Tennesse senator Ruth Martin played by Diane Baker.Clarice finds out that if she does not get to Buffalo Bill fast enough then Buffalo Bill will kill Catherine. He plans to starve he and skin her for his 'Woman Suit'.Meanwhile Hannibal has escaped his highly guarded cell by killing to police officers and disguising himself as one of the mutilated officers. He gets put in an ambulance unmasks himself and escapes.Clarice finds Buffalo Bill but does not recognize him at first but then realizes who he is as he runs away. they both go down to the basement where Clarice finds Catherine and goes after Bill. Buffalo Bill toys with her and turns the basement lights out. he pulls out a revolver planning a sneak attack but is killed when Clarice hears the sound of him cocking his revolver. She shoots him 6 times and is hailed as a hero.In the films final scene Clarice gets a phone call from Hannibal who says that he has respect for her and does not wish to kill her. He then spots a Docter who was rude and harsh with him and says that he will 'Be Having An Old Friend For Dinner.' This film is a masterpiece and held my attention the entire time. It is entertaining, Gruesome and disturbing but your eyes never leave the screen. The story is one of the best I have ever seen, The characters are well written. The film deserves all of its' Oscar wins. The performances done by Jodie foster and Anthony Hopkins are some of the best I have seen. Jodie Fosters character is sweet and innocent and Anthony Hopkins is calm and gentle but has violent cannibalistic outbursts. If there is some reason you have not watched this unless of course you are too young to watch this then I am shocked. This is a film I wish everybody would see.Rated R For Strong Grisly Violent Content Including Terror And Disturbing Images, Abberant Sexual Content And Language.1hr 58min/118min.16 uses of the F-word.****/****",10,4,8,9 October 2012
Speed," If The Bus Goes Below 50 The Bomb Goes Off!
",Director Jan De Bont gives a pulse pounding thriller with Speed. The film is about Jack played by Keanu Reeves being told about a bomb on a bus that has been planted there by retired bomb squad agent Howard Payne played by Dennis Hopper. Jack is told that if the bus goes below 50 miles per hour than the bomb will go off. The bus is being driven by a passenger named Annie played by Sandra Bullock who gets the passengers out of some very hairy situations. The films story is well crafted and played out very nicely the acting is very convincing and Dennis Hoppers performance is very sinister and is a well played madman. If you want a film that will hold you on the edge of your seat the whole time than I recommend Speed.Rated R For Violence And Language.1hr 55min/115min.13 uses of the F-word.****/****,Null,0,2,9 October 2011
The Sixth Sense," I See Dead People(****Out Of ****)
",Belated Day 26 Of My 31 Days Of Horror 2.This film is recognized as having the best twist ending ever put to film. While agree it is great there are far better twist endings that I have seen.The film follows a young boy played by Haley Joel Osment as he begins to start seeing strange visions of ghosts. His parents hire a psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis in order to find out just what has happened to the boy.This film is one of 3 good films by M Night Shyamalan the others being Unbreakable and for me The Happening. The film has a creepy vibe and good special effects.

Flight," Denzel Washingtons Best Performance Yet(**** Out Of ****)
","After 12 years of making animated films Director Robert Zemeckis returns with Denzel Washington to make one of the best films of the year filled with humor drama and entertainment.The film starts off with captain Whip Whitaker played by Denzel Washington as he is preparing to fly a plane from Georgia to Florida. But disaster arises when the plane malfunctions begins spiraling out of control. Whip lands the plane but it crashes in the process. He is put into the hospital due to his injuries.Meanwhile a woman named Nicole played by Kelly Riley is a broken down drug addict who is barely getting by. One day she missuses a drug that she buys from one of her friends and is hospitalized in the same hospital as Whip.The next day Whips friend and drug dealer Harling Mays played by John Goodman comes by to pay him a visit. Whip then meets Nicole and he promises her that he stop by for a visit as soon as they are both out of the hospital.When Whip is out of the hospital he meets with his lawyer named Hugh Lang played by Don Chedale who tells Whip that Whips alcoholism and Drug use in his system may have caused the plane to crash but deems it impossible because out of all the pilots Whip is the only one who knew how to land the plane. Out of 102 souls on the plane only 6 died.Whip and Nicole begin a relationship but it quickly strains due to Whips alcoholism. He is scheduled to trail in ten days.Warning: The next paragraph contains spoilers. Please skip to the next one if you have not seen the film.After going nine days without a drink Whip goes on an all night bender and has Harling come over to straighten him out with rugs. The trial starts off well but goes downhill when Whip says that he did drink that day on the plane. He is sentenced to 5 years in prison but is over 1 year sober and has a better relationship with his son and Nicole.This is one of my top 5 favorite films of the year. I loved Denzel Washingtons performance. I truly believed that he was portraying an alcoholic and drug addict. John Goodman is great as the comic relief, Don Cheadle is fantastic as the lawyer and Kelly Riley gives on of the best performances of the year.The film also has a great story and not once does the film ever become boring. Robert Zemeckis has struck gold with this film and I hope that this along with my favorite film of 2012 End Of Watch get nominated for best film of the year.Rated R For Drug And Alcohol Abuse, Language, Sexuality/Nudity And An Intense Sequence.2hrs 19min/139min.57 uses of the F-word.****/****",10,3,7,20 November 2012
Pitch Perfect," Pitch Perfect(2012) Film Review
","Rating: 1/2* Out Of ****.Rated PG-13 For Sexual Material, Language And Drug References.1hr 52min/112min.Pitch Perfect is a great contender for the most overrated film of 2012. This film is astonishingly bad. I went into the film with an open mind and had actually heard really good things. What I eventually thought of the film after watching it was that not only was it overrated but it was jawdroppingly bad. The film has absolutely bad jokes, horribly written dialogue, no memorable performances and surprising to vulgar for a PG-13 rating. The film was of course slapped with a PG-13 rating so that way 12 year old girls can watch 500 times and annoy everybody with renditions of The Cup Song Anna Kendrick does in the film. Let me take you through all of the problems I had with the film and why I think it's overrated.The film follows Becca(Anna Kendrick) who wants to go to L.A. to be a full blown record producer. Instead she joins an accapella group called The Barden Bellas who, four months ago, had a tragic mishap in which the lead singer vomited all over the stage. Among the group is Fat Amy(Rebel Wilson) Chloe(Britney Snow) and much more. They go up against an all male acapella group called The Treblemakers led by Nicholas(Adam DeVine) in a tough competition to see who is the best acapella group on the campus.First, there are two things that save the film from a Zero Star rating. They are Adam DeVine and Rebel Wilson. They have the smartest and best and funniest written dialouge in the film. DeVine is best known for his performance on the extremely funny Comedy Central TV show Workaholics and transfers to this film quite well. Rebel Wilson is sweet and funny but I feel like she is just the predictable comedic relief with the typical fat person jokes but she does it well. That's about all I liked of the movie. But they are not in the film enough to warrant a 1 star rating. Half of one star is all this movie is getting. Also the acapella singing of the Universal Pictures logo was a nice touch.First off, this movie has a fascination with vomit. It's gross and also wants to make me vomit. The dialouge is poorly written filled with some of the worst puns I have ever heard. 'Aca-scuse me?' 'We are gonna be Aca-Awesome!' ENOUGH! If I hear one more 'Aca' pun I'm gonna shoot myself in the foot! Anna Kendrick performance is surprisingly boring and is the least interesting character which surprises me since her performance, albeit a small one, was fantastic in End Of Watch. Here, it looks like she could care less. The MPAA should be closely evaluated. I think this film should been given an R Rating. They give Bully, a really good film an R for language(Later re-rated to PG-13) but this film has drug references and sexual references galore to warrant an R but Because 11-12 year girls want to watch BOOM, PG-13. The joke are really bad. The only one I laughed at besides the ones said by Wilson and DeVine is the Rape whistle joke. This movie should be banished to depths of Cinematic Hell. Before I go I just want to say that shame on you the people that told me that this movie was good and funny. This is a great case of over-hyped cinema. Talenteed actors like DeVine, Wilson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are wasted in this pile of Garbage. To quote the Schmoes of Schmoes Know, this movie STOINKED!",1,3,10,27 May 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Come To Freddy!
","Day 12 Of My 31 Days Of Horror 2011.Director Wes Craven gives a landmark horror film with A Nightmare On Elm Street. The film follows Nancy played by Heather Langnenkamp who is being visited by a mysterious disfigured man wearing a glove with knives on it in her dreams. Little does she know that if you die in the dream you die in real life. The film has a great shock value the special effects are amazing and the story keeps you in until the very end. Despite some slow spots the film is definitely one that I recommend.Rated R For Sequences Of Terror And Bloody Violence/Gore, Disturbing Images, Language, And Some Sexuality/Nudity.1hr 32min/92min.4 uses of the F-word.***1/2/****",Null,0,0,12 October 2011
Heat," You Need To Get In And Out Without Any Heat Following You.
","The film is about Neil McCauley played by Robbert DeNiro and his gang start creating violent bank robberies all around the town of L.A. This gets on the radar of Lt Vinncent Hanna played by Al Pacino who wants to make it his mission to put these guys in jail.Halfway Through the film Pacino and DeNiro can settle their differences and sit down for a cup of coffee together talking about their daily lives. This is a nice little segway from the film.This is really well done film. Both Vetran actors Pacino and Deniro are terrific in this one with the best scene being the one I just mentioned. The plot is really well done. I like how real the gunfights are. All you hear are the sound effects of bullets, no music like most movies do. The characters are well developed and The final chase is great. This film is a must for Pacino, DeNiro and Gangster Fans alike.Rated R For Violence And Language.2hrs 52min/172min.56 uses of the F-word.****/****",10,0,1,17 May 2012

Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Worse Than Revenge Of The Fallen!(1/2* Out Of ****)
","I really like the first Transformers movie. It was fun and entertaining. Revenge Of The Fallen was a terrible movie riddled with problems. So when I saw that this film grossed $1,123,746,996 when it was in theaters, Than it has to be good right? WRONG! This is one of the most frustrating movies I have ever sat through. This film has more problems than Revege Of The Fallen. Here are the Top 10 Reasons why I hated Transformers Dark Of The Moon.#10: A Horrible Experience At An Unbearable Length. Not only is this film terrible but why do I have to sit through it for 2hrs and 35min?!!? Its bad enough just having to sit through the second one with Skids and Mudflap.#9: Story, What Story? The films story is so confusing, especially If you have not seen the first two. This movie jumps around so much that by the time it was over I felt like I had just gotten off of a trampoline with 20 other people. The plot that I understood is that the Decepticons are going after a Cybertronian space craft.#8: My Parents Are Not This Bad. The parents in this film are annoying and useless. All they seem to do in every movie is bring up something Sexual and uncomfortable. They bing absolutely nothing to the movie and are just pointless filler. Speaking of which.#7: What Are We Going To Put In It? Half of this movie is just pointless filler. Whether it's Shia LaBeouf whining and crying about not having a job, Him trying to get a job or pointless humor it is not needed. Even the last hour of the film with the Chicago fight is so tedious to watch.#6: We Won't Use Them For Anything Important. Some of the cast in this film is wasted. People Like Peter Cullen, Leonard Nimoy, John Turturro, John Malkovich, Alan Tudyk, Francis McDormand and Tyrese Gibson are all in this movie and are wasted because they serve no purpose. The only two who serve a purpose are Peter Culllen who voices Optimus Prime and Leonard Nimoy who voices Starscream.#5: We'll Call Him Deep Wang, Because It's Funny Right? There is a character in this film named Deep Wang played by Ken Jeoung. All he does in this movie for the 7 minutes of screen time he has is talk ghetto. An that's Funny right. Wrong because he serves no purpose to the story whatsoever. You can also check out Ken Jeoung in the soon to be destined classic, Big Mommas Like Father Like Son.#4. What Is Misogyny? This film thinks that Women are just in these movies to be Sex symbol's. I hate to be a broken record but Rosi Hunnigton-Whiteley Serves no purpose. They just show her in her underwear and is completely forgettable. Showing her in her underwear is not needed in a Transformers movie. (Although it was nice) It still was not needed. Also the female characters serve no purpose they are just there to show themselves off and thats It. Oh by the way for those who do not know what Mysogyny is, it means a hateful or stereotypical view of women.#3: Ehren Kruger Writes Better Than You (NOT). Literally 90% of these robots I could not recognize because they don't say who they are. Idid not know until this movie is over and that is an example of how well the writer, Ehren Kruger who wrote a good movie Arlington Road, Introduces these characters for people like me who do not have an encyclopedic knowledge of Transformers.#2: You Know, For Kids! This movie is so Vulgar, Rauncy and Violent that I cannot believe that some parents took little 6 year old Timmy to see this movie. This movie is riddled with Sexual Content and Innuendo plus Too much senseless murdering by the robots in this film.#1: Shia LaBeouf. I Really hate this actor. All he does in this movie is whine and cry about how he does not have a job and how he saved the world twice when it was all the robots doing the saving and boo hoo this and boo hoo that. I hated him in Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull, Wall Street Money Never Sleeps and Transformers 2 and 3, Because that is all he does. Quite frankly I hope I don't have to sit through another movie with him again. I wanted to shut this movie off because of Him. If you Like Him, fine but me personally I just can't stand him.Well there you have it. The Top 10 Reasons why I hated Transformers Dark Of The Moon. Runner up is invoking images of 9/11 and The Challenger Explosion and the fact that I know What The Challenger Explosion is at age 14 is impressive. The only Character That I was invested in was Optimus Prime. Even though he is awesome That really should not happen.Rated PG-13 For Intense Prolonged Sequences Of Sci-Fi Action Violence, Mayhem And Destuction, And For Language, Some Sexuality And Innuendo.2hrs 35min/155min.2 uses of the F-word.1/2*/****",1,3,8,29 November 2012
