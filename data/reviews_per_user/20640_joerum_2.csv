The Blair Witch Project," Good movie overwhelmed by hype
","The Blair Witch Project was a good movie, but totally overwhelmed by the hype surrounding it.I first became aware of Blair a while back when one of their promo trailers ran on a cable access channel here in Brooklyn.  It left me questioning whether this was a true story or some put on.  It was very well done and really psyched me for the acutal movie.  However, all the hype became totally out of hand once the movie was released.Now, to the movie itself.  The plot line was very well developed at the beginning of the movie and was able to sustain itself for the initial foray of Heather, Mike and Josh in the woods.  However, the mid section with everyone running around in the woods became extremely tedious and even annoying at time with their ineptitude.  But, this was rectified with the truly spooky ending, the type that will always haunt you (if you got into the movie that is).  I really appreciated a horror story built around the psychological elements of fear as opposed to a lot of overrated special effects.My rating - 7.",7,0,1,24 October 1999
The Matrix," Beyond the flash, not too much substance
","The Matrix is the typical hyperactive action movie that once you look past its flash there is not too much substance.  With a really good movie of this type, the questions will not arise until after you've been on the rollercoaster ride.  However, the Matrix doesn't live up to that standard, which is why it deserves only a 6.Some questions I had while watching the Matrix: 1.  Why do the machines need humans as a source of energy?  Fossil, nuclear, thermal even cows, wouldn't be better source? 2.  If the entire Matrix is computer generated by the machines, why do they run around shooting bullets instead of just bending the situation to their needs? 3.  How are the 'warriors' fueling/repairing their ship? 4.  What sort of power has made Neo the One?  God? The Force?Overall, the typical one man fight against 'them' and all the evil 'they' personify yet in no way exploring what the alternative is once everyone is freed from their pod.  I would guess The One enslaves them all and has them erect a temple to his glory.  I'd rather stay in my pod.",6,0,1,20 April 2000
