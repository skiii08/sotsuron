Gremlins," I couldn't stop laughing (after I turned thirteen)
","Well, I saw this film twice. The first time was in grade six... lets just say I had a week gut. Now, the kitchen scene, as well as the melting scene at the end, and the scene in which billy is shot in the stomach with a mini crossbow and then attacked with a mini chainsaw has scarred for life MANY kids that I know (including a boy who will remain nameless who can't walk into toys R us because he's afraid of firbees). At eleven years old, i picked it up in the family section of my local Hollywood video and was pleased to see a 'PG' rating. The first misleading bit of info. Then I popped it in and actually watched it... and long story short my already-eaten dinner wound up on my bedroom floor during the microwave scene. For two years I went hating the movie. Then, I found the magic of slasher movies.Well, once I could stomach freddy VS jason, I decided to give It a second chance. I watched it, laughed until I felt like I was going to puke, watched it again, bought the second one and well... I became a gremlins fan. The only problem with this movie is the fact that it is made out to look like a children's film (don't believe me, watch the trailer). It really should be released with a more mature rating (pg-13 maybe...) for those violent scenes.But if you have a good stomach and get joy from the pain and suffering of fictional characters, you'll love this movie!",10,0,2,8 April 2007
