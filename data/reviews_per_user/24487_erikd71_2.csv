The Ring," Good, but unnecessary remake
","After seeing the fantastic original 'Ringu', I watched this remake suspecting it would be a noisy, gory slam-bang hollywood rehash. Fortunately, I was wrong. The Ring is a well made remake and follows the original quite closely, even in atmosphere. It's close enough to say that if you hate this movie, you probably won't like the original either. Some sequences are even shot-by-shot the same. Acting is adequate, cinematography is excellent, the pace is good. Unfortunately, there are some issues with this remake imho.
<ul><li>They replaced some important storylines of the original with that really lame horse nonsense.</li></ul><ul><li>The 'scary' make up effects are overdone and not scary at all.</li></ul><ul><li>The 'samara' character is too flat and too young. She's just plain evil in this flick where in the original she's a 18ish teenager with a more complex and sad background (see Ring 0: Birthday) which makes it more thought provoking and believable that she became what she is.</li></ul><ul><li>The ending is not as satisfying as the original.</li></ul><ul><li>While pacing is good (I'm glad it still has the quiet pace of the original), it's not as good as in the original where its momentum gradually builds up until it's firmly stuck under you skin.</li></ul>Now I still think it's quite good, but it doesn't add anything over the original to make it really worthwhile. If you don't mind watching a subtitled japanese movie, definitely go for the original Ring (aka Ringu).",Null,8,14,7 April 2004
"I, Robot"," Don't compare it too much to the book
","I've heard many comments about the movie having nothing to do with the book. Actually movie never claimed to be a complete movie adaptation of the book. I see it as a big blockbuster movie loosely based on Asimov's ideas and I feel that it has been maintaining many key aspects of Asimov's short stories. The three laws, the mystery plot, the robot's dream, it's all there. The movie then takes the premise of that robot's dream further and explores what could have happened in a very clever way (in the book, the robot was terminated after he told about his dream and the story ended there).But, add to the clever plot lots of slam bam action sequences and explosions, impressive special effects, a slick look, plus a wisecracking Will Smith doing his best to be ultra cool (his usual routine) and you have a blockbuster movie. While this works in a way, it makes the movie a bit uneven as it tries to please too many crowds. While I personally could do with less of the blockbuster qualities and would liked to have seen a more focused approach to the material, the movie actually works quite well and is still pretty enjoyable.A faithful book adaptation? Not really, but still worth bearing the same name as the script is largely written in the same spirit. And why should a movie follow a book exactly? Would Blade Runner be the classic it is if it would have followed Dick's book closely? I don't think so.",7,0,1,17 December 2004
