The Hangover," No Idea???
","No idea how everyone thinks this movie is so funny. Lame humor, predictable, but then again I don't find Bob Saggett or Robin Williams funny either, maybe it's just me??? It was like one of those people who try to be funny all the time, the jokes are forced and just don't work. I can honestly say that I didn't find any part of this movie truly funny. It is amazing how the media can make the public do what it wants. Just goes to show how most people are just puppets of the media. They hype it up and give it high reviews and tell you how hilarious and super funny it is, then people review it and say its hilarious and super funny!! Unbelievable, I just wish more people could think on their own and form their own ideas and thoughts besides being told what to do and think.",1,6,13,23 February 2011
