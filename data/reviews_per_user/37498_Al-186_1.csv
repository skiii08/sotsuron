Raiders of the Lost Ark," My Favorite Movie Of All Time
","This is with out a doubt my favorite movie of all time. Star Wars was good but this has to be the greatest series of action films ever made. It has everything including great storyline, probably some of the greatest action sequences of all time, great directing, and great music. Harrison Ford does a great job playing the character of Indiana Jones. I'm praying Indiana Jones 4 comes out in the year 2001.",Null,0,0,3 June 1999
