","I don't know how in the right mind someone could rate this movie more then 3 stars, yes the acting was great, top notch even I admit, but the story is soo out of context. It does not make sense once you know what going on, I mean you think you know, it just looses the whole mystery and becomes unwatchable. You know sometimes some horror movies we at least get to laugh at little and enjoy the dark comedy but this movie completely misses on all that. I don't know how anyone connecting the dots here but trust me there is nothing to connect.",1,0,2,25 August 2018
