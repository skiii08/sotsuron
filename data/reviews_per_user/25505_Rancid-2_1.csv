Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Meant to be Watched Multiple Times
","When I sat down to watch Episode 1 at the 12:05 am showing opening night at the Ziegfeld theater in Manhattan, I knew there would be a chance of disappointment. With all the bad reviews and bad press it had been getting, the only thing that kept my hopes high was that I knew around 6 people who went to press screenings before opening night and loved it.I also LOVED The Phantom Menace after that first showing. Yet there were many things I didn't like about the movie at first. It was only later that day, when I saw it again, that I realized what a spectacular creation I had watched.After seeing it once I loved it, it was ahead of ROTJ in my list of favorites. After seeing it twice I thought it was AMAZING. I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I've seen it 6 times so far, but plan to see it many many more times. every time I watch it I notice new things, that is one way I know that this is truly a Star Wars movie.And for those of you who didn't like the movie, I urge you to see it again. It is much better the second time around.",10,0,0,24 May 1999
