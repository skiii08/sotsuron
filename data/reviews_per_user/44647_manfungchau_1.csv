Catch Me If You Can," An interesting chase movie
","When his parents separated and he had to choose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jr. ran away from home. He warned his money from cashing fabricated cheques, posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor. As the numbers went up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty started tracking him in a cat and mouse game. Based on a true story, I think this is a good film. The plot starts from the end and jumps back to see why and how Frank Abagnale Jr. was captured by Carl Hanratty. It is the reason why the two hours goes by very quickly. The presentation is good. The opening credits impressed me and attracted me to continue watching this film. I also enjoyed watching the exciting game of cat and mouse. The cast is good as all of them acted very well. I think DiCaprio is good, he acted well and he made a lot of expressions. Hanks has also done a good work. His character is quite dull but I really thought that he did better than DiCaprio. Both of them gave a fine performance. On the whole this film is an interesting chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is slightly more enjoyable for being a true story. This film was excited and interesting to let me staying on the seat for two hours.",9,2,3,23 February 2005
