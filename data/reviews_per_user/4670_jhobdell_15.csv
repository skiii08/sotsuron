The Incredible Hulk," Fantastic!
","Finally! I think this is the film I've unknowingly been waiting for this year. I don't think I can fault any part of it. I was sceptical at first - I often am with sequels where EVERY SINGLE cast member has been changed - but this was refreshingly good for a sequel, and I think it worked better than the original.The opening is especially good to look at - covering parts of the story in the interim period since the first story (with some overlap I suspect). The story begins in a favela in Brazil, and the imagery of that 'suburb' was amazing to me - it seriously looks like a small, highly compact town made of lego or different coloured boxes. A brilliant choice of location. Norton and Tyler have great chemistry, I think, and Hurt steps into Sam Elliot's steps brilliantly as General Ross. Tim Roth is brilliantly psychotic, increasing as the film progresses, and for once, the 'showdown' at the end of the film isn't a disappointing series of flashing images. It actually touches on many points that were not quite clear in the first film: although he is to bullets, Hulk is not completely invulnerable. And even the use of the line 'Hulk Smash!' doesn't seem inappropriate.Beyond the film, it is clear that something big is in the making at Marvel: the cameo from Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark (tie-in to Iron Man) is very intriguing, and a little research will show films of The Avengers team (Wolverine in 2009, Thor in 2010, and Captain America and The Avengers in 2011). I'm drooling just thinking about it!",10,2,9,13 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Hooray for Jack Black!
","Oh this was great! Right from the get go you can tell it'll be hilarious and a little wacky. Jack Black is perfect as Po, the main character Panda. Similarly, everyone is great in their individual roles - Angelina Jolie, Dustin Hoffman, Ian McShane. There are some great funny moments as the totally inept Po attempts to train as the omnipotent Dragon Warrior.The best thing, for me, is the philosophical element, totally in keeping with the period of Ancient China. Although the fun of the movie will obviously appeal to children, and there is enough visual humour to keep everyone entertained, the philosophy, particularly of Master Oogway, means that there is something for the adult mind to latch on to and take away from it. Maybe that's too intellectual a standpoint for this kind of film but that's what I took from it.This was great fun - go enjoy it!",8,1,2,9 July 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Better than 1 but still not up to scratch
","First things first: let's be honest, the first film was rubbish. For me the glaring oversight was not having a brilliantly stonking heavy metal (ish) soundtrack: the film was crying out for something gutsy to push it up. The soundtrack here was no better but it wasn't so obvious. There is a fascinating plot, and enough story development left over for a third film if del Toro fancies it. The special effects of all the characters were fantastic, particularly the Forest Elemental.All that said, however briefly, this film was still hugely disappointing to me. There was little, if anything, about it to make you jump up and say 'That was a brilliant film'. I know I've said it already, but for me, this genre of film NEEDS a rock/metal score. There needs to be more emotional connection with the main characters, and someone needs to give Perlman a chance to use his huge range of acting ability, rather than being an overgrown adolescent with red skin.To conclude, I'd say go and see it, but keep your expectations low if you want to really enjoy it.",5,1,4,25 August 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Interesting
","There can be no doubt that this is a very controversial subject area. Child abduction is a horrible thing for any parent or relative to contemplate. The film is very interesting in the line it takes and the head it reaches is a thought-provoking (if rather bizarre) dilemma.Casey Affleck is great as the young detective to investigate the disappearance of a young girl in his neighbourhood (the oh so subtly named Amanda MacCreadey is the girl's character). But of the two, his partner, played by Michelle Monaghan, is far more believable. Morgan Freeman is solid and does a great job of portraying his character during his brief appearances.Overall though I think my hat is off to Ed Harris, who plays a seriously tough police detective, and is actually quite terrifying at times.I think the film is a little too on the 'band wagon' - the parallels to the Madeleine McCann story are too in your face - but it is presented sensitively, and there can be no denial that it has a delicious twist, and the ultimate question is left hanging in a very poignant manner. I'll be interested in seeing how Ben Affleck's directing skills progress.",7,0,0,13 June 2008
21," A mini 'Ocean's 11'
","I had above-average expectations of this movie (that is to say I was hoping it would do more than just entertain me!) and to begin with I was afraid it would be a massive disappointment. I'm not sure of the timescale exactly, but the first 'section' seemed very slow-moving and frankly rather dull. But credit to the whole crew: it picked up very nicely in line with the excitement of the college students and their professor heading for Vegas, and his descent into 'insanity' certainly stirred feelings of frustration from me.Beyond the quality of the story and its realisation, Spacey is in fine form, as is a rather menacing Laurence Fishburne. The younger actors are unquestionably good, and a semi-naked Kate Bosworth is always worth a look! Hang on in through the initial brush-strokes: the outline is boring, but the colours are dazzling.",8,1,2,19 April 2008
Wanted," Inspiring and very, very cool
","This is another film I've been looking forward to since it was first advertised. I was actually worried it might not live up to the hype, such as it's been, but I was very pleasantly surprised.McAvoy definitely wouldn't have been my first choice as a male lead for a film like this, but then that's without the benefit of knowing how the film starts off. We get a very good look at his life, pre-The Fraternity, and it is an excruciating and demeaning one, like most of ours if we're honest. His terror and anxiety attacks complete the picture, and the transformation to cold, calculating assassin (via cocky school boy attitude to his training) is done extremely well. By comparison, Jolie seems to be there for her looks more than anything - she says so little it's almost shocking. That said, her character's depth is still portrayed well with looks and gestures, besides Jolie's undeniable screen presence. David O'Hara is a brilliant addition for the opening assassination sequence and Morgan Freeman, as always, is the man.The story builds up well enough, although I might have gone a more flashy route with the whole assassination/execution area. That said, it's the conclusion that makes the film for me: like many great works of art/entertainment, it is a very simple and direct idea, 'hidden' inside an elaborate piece of work. And in the words of that conclusion, 'What HAVE you -or I- done lately?!'",10,12,26,25 June 2008
Tropic Thunder," Utterly stupid...I loved it!
","To be fair, the seven-star rating is possibly a little unfair. It's hard to know how to rate this film after seeing it only once. I laughed uproariously and that was enough.The premise of making a more war-like atmosphere for filming a war epic was pretty good, even if the inevitable descent into an actual war-like environment was hopelessly predictable. With that out of the way, this film goes on to spoof every war epic for the last 30 years: Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Predator, Rambo, The Dirty Dozen and Forrest Gump to name but a few. There's even a hint of Proof of Life.The film is utterly bizarre and totally brainless but all the random elements somehow hang together to make a vaguely coherent whole that is absolutely hilarious (although I'm still not sure how Tom Cruise's cameo fits in!)",7,0,2,21 September 2008
Quantum of Solace," Magic!
","Well as Marc Forster has frequently been quoted as saying: following Casino Royale was always going to be a tall order. A lot of people seem to have struggled with the idea of the story continuing on any and every level, from the quality of the film, to the development (or lack thereof) of Bond's character.For me, this film was all about the psychology of the situation: that Bond has been viewed as a cold-blooded, ruthless killer only serves the aftermath of Vesper's death. The 'inconsolable rage' drives him far and deep into his grief and in a darker vein than Casino Royale, it paves the way for Bond's traditional character: the serial one-night-stander trying to forget, the pithy humour masking his torment, the violence that outlets his rage, masking as duty to Queen and Country. And just for the record, if you doubt the development of Bond's character, consider both his return for the girl, whom he doesn't sleep with, his frustration at the death of Fields, and most importantly the moment of touching intimacy that he shares with Mathis.For me, this film was never going to be about equalling Casino Royale and always about making the continuation of the story realistic and believable. In that regard I found little to fault here, from the opening chase sequence to the maturity of Bond's actions in the conclusion.In all honesty my only gripe was the title song. If anything it was worse than the unbearable, tinny 'Die Another Day' by Madonna: the only decent bit of melody was the guitar riff that only features twice within the song itself. Something better next time, please!",9,4,9,7 November 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," Reasonably entertaining but...
","Oh good grief! How are the mighty fallen? I feel compelled to comment on this title, having seen it again last night. I've been disappointed by it every time. I think my biggest problem with it has to be around the character of Jean Grey/The Phoenix. At the end of X-Men 2, they hinted very heavily at her realisation as the character of the Marvel comic books and I was expecting/anticipating it right up until the moment she re-appears in the story. I was expecting her to be the ultimate weapon in the X-Men's arsenal, against Magneto's growing army, not a largely innocuous member of Magneto's 'Brotherhood'. As a result, Magneto's army seems pitifully small, the action confined to the USA, when the development of the so-called cure could have been a catalyst to something far more widespread and exciting.There are many things to recommend the film but for the most part I can't get past the continuing focus on two totally undeveloped groups of mutants, the idiocy of not using The Phoenix as more than an obscure figurehead (so much more could have been made of the class 5 mutant idea), and most especially a Famke Janssen who looks positively jaundiced!",4,0,1,21 April 2008
The Dark Knight," Mixed feelings...sort of
","This is only the second film I've reviewed that I've given 10 stars to, and to be honest that is mostly based on Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. In some ways I feel the film has suffered as a result of Ledger's death and all the hype around this portrayal and you cannot help but ask, how much of the adulation and the Oscar rumours are due to his untimely death back in January. That said, I've been looking forward to seeing this film since I Ledger's death and the comments on his performance, particularly from Michael Caine - some of the praise from such an established actor about someone still so fresh, relatively, is staggering.I was absolutely delighted by Ledger's performance - that at least wasn't ruined by all the hype. His psychotic hilarity is delicious. The disappearing pencil trick is quite horrific, the more so because of the intense, aggressive indifference he manages to conjure up. But for me (and I urge everyone to look out for it), that defining moment of the performance is the video that Alfred and Bruce watch together: the strangled roar 'LOOK AT ME!!!' is so unnerving it defies belief.In summation, I think this is a fantastic film. It lives up to the ambiance of its predecessor, and I believe Ledger's cult status is well deserved. Go see it and enjoy it, I promise you won't be disappointed!",10,6,13,29 July 2008
The Happening," Good, but...
","I'm really not sure about this one. Obviously nothing Shymalan does is likely to live up to his initial, innovative success with The Sixth Sense, but they're all very imaginative and original. The premise underlying this one is particularly chilling, I think, because it has a basis in reality. I don't think anyone has ever lived whose bones never break (the basic premise of Unbreakable), but evidently plants are capable of changing rapidly to defend themselves, even if the extent to which this idea is carried in Shyamalan's new film seems quite ridiculous.Personally I'm not sure about Wahlberg's acting - he seems either lethargic, apathetic or simply not involved a lot of the time. That said, there are some great moments: particularly the scene where he and the little girl, Jess, comfort each other, seen from a distance. I think the best character has to be the psychotic old Mrs Jones.The full horror of what happens when subjected to the 'threat' is always hinted at but never fully revealed, in line with the certificate no doubt. The ending is suitably chilling for me, but overall the driving force behind the idea for the film is clearly the environmental band wagon.It's a good film, but there's a slightly galling aftertaste.",7,8,18,14 June 2008
Hancock," Smith is the man!
","I loved this film! As you can see, 9/10 is good and it's not far off a 10. The only let down, for me, was the lack of development. There was lots of potential, but the film was kept short (perhaps rightly so) and some of the ideas just didn't flourish as they might have.That said, Smith's on screen presence is undeniable, and there was some great chemistry between he and Theron. Bateman was clearly the main comic relief and was great with it, but Smith has some brilliant comic lines too, especially early on. I totally didn't see the main plot twist coming, and the detail was covered, if (as I said) not fully developed, perhaps.The action scenes are exciting, there are some real 'laugh out loud' moments, and the conclusion of the film is wonderfully bittersweet. It's especially moving to see the truth of Hancock's character coming out: moving from embittered loner to awkward hero/star and Smith pulls it off marvellously.I have a sneaking suspicion there may be a sequel, but perhaps that's just wishful thinking!",9,3,8,2 July 2008
Never Back Down," A new 'Karate Kid'
","Perhaps my descriptive summary is unkind to this film. I enjoyed it so much because it depicts a young man learning to deal with his emotions, rather than being ruled by his fear of them. It is quite remarkable, the strength of character he ultimately develops, and his interactions with his instructor are gratifyingly free of the childish morality one dreads in such a film, or the typical oriental platitudes that often hallmark them because of the origins of martial arts. At the root of this, I think, is the film's willingness to observe and comment on the 'problem' emotion of anger. Rather than leave it festering, or simply transform it 'as if by magic', the audience can almost see the transformation in the main character, through his physical exertion, which eventually leaves him free of its destructive role in his life. For most, if not all, these reasons, I enjoyed the film because it resonated with me quite closely, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea.If nothing else, I for one will be researching the possibilities of training in mixed martial arts!",8,52,84,19 April 2008
Iron Man," Bravo Favreau!
","Right from the start (perhaps even beforehand) I was expecting this to be quite special. As usual entertainment is my only requirement of a film for me to like it and this was fabulous. There are so many elements that make it work. In terms of the storyline, there is at least just enough of everything to make it hang together well: enough background to qualify Stark's naivety and arrogance (plus enough of Downey Jr's boyish charm to make him a believable celebrity industrialist!) besides his genius; enough of the water torture scene to make his submission acceptable (and enough visible anger to both drive and carry his deception); there is enough chemistry between Downey Jr and Paltrow to hint at the relationship that never quite blooms; and finally there is enough left hanging to betray a sequel possibly already on the table. Downey Jr largely carries the film in terms of the acting; Paltrow is on fine form but hardly used to her full potential (for a rare but wonderful glimpse of this I recommend 'Proof'). Favreau's almost Hitchcockian cameo is downplayed sufficiently for it not to seem either contrived or haphazard. Ultimately, though, I think my hat is off to Jeff Bridges as possibly the most hate-able villain of the Marvel franchise so far.The use of heavy metal-esquire music for the soundtrack is quite appropriate given the title! And to conclude, the transformation/revelation of most of the characters is remarkable: Stark from self-involved to regretful, Potts from indulgent and condescending to affectionate, Stane from colleague to nemesis. I recognise the possibility of a sequel justifying it, but this didn't quite get to 9 for me purely because the ending is a little too unclosed. That tiny thing aside, this was magic; enjoy!",8,16,29,1 May 2008
Pineapple Express," Bizarre...and refreshingly oddball funny
","I wasn't sure what this was going to be like at all before seeing it. I'd seen the clip with Franco's foot stuck through the car windscreen of course (it's about the only trailer bit I could remember) but that wasn't much preparation. I've not really seen a stoner movie before (not and 'understood' what was going on, so to speak) so this was a revelation of sorts. I'm from England, yet I have no doubt that this film is dripping 80s (and possibly even 70s) US TV nostalgia, in a similar sort of way to Son of Rambow over here.The characters are all slightly deranged, but the observation on their little idiosyncrasies are quite delightfully done. In the end, the film is mostly about the eternal friendship that seems to pervade the stone-head's 'psyche' (such as it is) and its presentation is hilarious. For some reason I found the bit where 'Red' shoots off one of the dead guys' feet with a shotgun, for no apparent reason of course.If you're not a fan of stoner's, obviously, stay away; if on the other hand you are, or you're not sure, this will probably amuse you a great deal!",7,4,9,21 September 2008
