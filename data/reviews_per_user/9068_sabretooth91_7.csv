Black Swan," Seriously?
","I'm sitting here reading all of these reviews about people who are blown away by this 'masterpiece'. Maybe it is a masterpiece, and I just can't see it. Maybe if my master's degree was in theater, instead of engineering I'd 'get' this movie. I went out of my way to see this movie after hearing others talk about it, because the previews did nothing for me. But I value what others have to say, so I went for it. Maybe my girlfriend would like it. I was expecting something along the lines of The Usual Suspects, where I'm sitting at the edge of my seat, paying attention to every little detail to see if I can figure out the twist at the end of the movie.That is exactly what I did. I was wide-eyed, while my girlfriend fell asleep. The first time I realized whatever just happened was just in her head, I was really excited. How much of it was really in her head? How do I figure out what was real and what wasn't? I almost re-started from the beginning right there. Then, I realized if I wasn't expecting a twist, I'd be really bored right now. Ohhh, there better be an awesome twist! Is she being drugged this whole time? Is this girl trying to help her, have sex with her, take her role, or even kill her? Did she kill her mom by accident? Did she kill that girl? I was glad that I stayed awake for the sex scene. Thank you for that.The end of the movie absolutely crushed me! Oh you mean, she's just a stupid, crazy ballerina, who thinks ballet is real? Come on! I dated one of those! They all take it way too seriously! Sigh..... I wanted some logical explanation for all the crazy stuff that was happening, and maybe tie in her mom's history a bit more. Something that explains WHY all of this stuff was happening. You can't just say 'oh, she's crazy' What a cop-out! This had all of the creativity (story-wise) as Trick-r-Treat.With that said, the cinematography, was some of the best I've ever seen! If not, it was the best! I may re-watch this just for the cinematography. The lighting, camera angles, camera movement, position on the screen! Everything! It just set the right mood and contributed to the story and the feeling. Absolutely epic! So, the cinematographer saved this movie for me. Other than that... crazy ballerina loses her mind? eh, seen it. With a different ending, this movie could have gone down in history. Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe I don't have the necessary vision. Maybe the incorrect half of my brain is functional to 'get' this movie. Maybe it will go down in history as a great. If it does, someone please explain to me why. I want to understand. Seriously, I don't get it.",6,1,2,16 May 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Great Action and I enjoyed the stories
","I can't believe some of the people trashing this movie. I thought it was great! The action was loads of fun. The mermaids were incredible. The stories and side-stories kept me interested in the characters. It is funny, some people thought there was too much time spent on secondary characters while others wanted more. I thought it was just right. I still feel a little uneasy about how the mermaid romance ended. I would think that a devoted Christian wouldn't dabble in pagan magic, correct? Anyway, all the main characters were incredible, and I didn't miss the actors who didn't come back one bit. I wish the fate of Blackbeard would have had a twist. A man with one leg would kill him. We all knew it would be Barbosa, of course. Wouldn't it have been great if someone else had killed him during the fight who just happened to have one leg? Perhaps lost in that very fight? That would have been sweet. I loved the ending to the movie. I think Sparrow has grown throughout the Pirates series. Some people think he should be more selfish. I think not. I thought it was brilliant, and the only way to end the movie at that point. Allowing her to keep her self-respect and show her willingness to give her own life, while exposing Blackbeards selfishness. Awesome. I hope we see another Pirates with Commodore Jack Sparrow!",9,0,0,6 June 2011
The Hunger Games," Not truly accurate to the book, but a great movie
","The Hunger Games was done really well. I had been waiting for this movie for as long as it was announced it was coming out. A year? I am a huge fan of the books and I know many others who are as well. This is a brilliant reflection on the human species, our society, and our government.I can't stand people who try to compare this to other movies, because this isn't trying to be another movie. This is telling Katniss' and Peta's stories. And the stories of the struggles of the districts.Anyway, the cinematography is great. The make-up and clothes of the capitol are right-on. The differences in the quality of life of the districts and the Capitol are portrayed very well. As far as I can remember, the action at the Games seems about right. I was glad to see that they didn't focus on the gore. That's not really the point. I'm glad there was time spent on Rue and District 11.Now my gripes. Why did you half-ass the CG of the dogs?!!! WHY!? I wanted to see that SO bad! For those who don't know, the bad-ass dogs are actually supposed to be some kind of man-made mutt, where each dog resembles an individual dead tribute. It royally screws with Katniss' head, and she has trouble killing them. And I wanted to see what a make-up artist imagined them to look like. So boooo! I had a couple minor gripes about little things that happened differently in the book. I imagine that they were changed for the movie because they don't have a major impact on the plot or story, and there really wasn't time to develop another character just to give Katniss the Mockingjay pin. Just little things which weren't a really big deal (that I noticed anyway) What carries this movie is the story. The people are being oppressed and controlled by the Capitol. I'm glad Katniss wasn't made up too much in the movie to be too beautiful (with make-up etc). The mood seemed right. Everything was pretty dark and dreary. Everyone seemed oppressed and depressed. That was right on. There were some quick scenes that reveal Katniss' past and that of her family and District. I'm not sure if someone who hadn't read the books would have noticed what they meant. I don't think it was pointed out that the Mockingjay became the symbol of the previous revolution, and Katniss was wearing it during the Hunger Games.I went to see this at IMAX with a bunch of friends. Must of them hadn't read the books. They seemed to enjoy this movie the most: probably because they didn't know how it would end. They had wide-open eyes and big smiles after the movie. Then, we all had a great discussion afterward. Unfortunately, my friends are perpetually tardy, so we had to sit so close, I couldn't fit the entire screen in my peripheral. I'll have to go see it again to appreciate it better.In closing.... Go see this movie. You won't be disappointed.",9,2,7,30 March 2012
Shutter Island," Great 'thinker' movie with a great twist
","This is a great movie to watch if you're good at paying attention to the little details. I was told there was a twist in this movie, which I'm sure everyone is aware of. I did predict what the twist would be before sitting down in the theater, however. There were points during the movie where I was second-guessing myself about the twist, and hoping I was wrong. The little clues throughout the movie will point you in the right direction. Regardless, you will find yourself confused, trying to sort things out, you may even feel like you belong on Shutter Island. It is not overly gory. It is not really scary, and I am a sissy when it comes to scary movies. There are a couple suspenseful parts, but nothing too bad. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time, trying to piece together the clues. This is a great movie for those who like plots and cinematography. Watch this with a friend. Before the movie, write down what you think the twist might be based on the trailer. Afterward, you will have a great intellectual discussion. The only reason I gave this a 9 instead of a 10, is because I was able to predict the ending before the movie began.",9,0,5,28 February 2010
Bad Teacher," Good for some laughs
","I read the reviews for this, and was instantly turned off. However, it was my girlfriend's turn to pick the movie, and she picked Bad Teacher. I wasn't looking forward to the movie after the reviews I read. The theater was quite empty, too. First of all, I agree that there will be no prize for a brilliantly written script. The morals were absolutely horrible, and no one still in grade school should be allowed to watch this movie. It is for adults, and adults who understand that this movie does not depict actual teachers. In fact, a vast majority of teachers are closer to the goody-goody teacher, Miss Squirrel (who annoyed the h&!! out of me by the end of the movie) The real problem with our public school system is with the lack of support at home regarding discipline and backing up the teachers from the parents (but I digress). There may not have been laugh after laugh in this movie, but the funny parts were really funny. I laughed out loud quite a lot. Much more than I thought I would. The gym teacher was my favorite character/actor, by far. Diaz did very well with what she was given. I found myself rooting for this shallow, poor excuse for a human being. I think only Diaz could make me do that. yeah, the moral of the story was horrible and it painted teachers in a bad light. But it was funny, and it isn't meant for people who still need morals to be taught to them. So, while I don't suggest it as your first pick, there's no reason to dread seeing Bad Teacher. I don't know why it is so funny to hear gorgeous blonds and little kids swear, but it is.... and it doesn't hurt to look at Diaz for a couple hours. (thank you, car wash scene!)",Null,1,4,12 July 2011
Bridesmaids," It was OK, it wasn't THAT good
","I want to start off by saying this is a good movie and I would recommend it to others. I just read all of these glowing reviews and I must have had some really high expectations. I wasn't blown away like all of these other people were. I saw it with my girlfriend. We both laughed and had a great time. After it was over, we moved on though. We weren't quoting the movie or talking about it for hours.The character development was great. I enjoyed the originality of the jokes and situations the characters were placed in. For the most part, it wasn't stupidly predictable, although there were parts where I knew what would happen later in the movie.This is a fun, witty comedy. I think it was geared toward the female audience. (I'm male) While I did get some really good laughs, I could tell some jokes were just not meant for me. I just sat there, rolling my eyes, like I was sitting at some sort of girl slumber party that I wasn't invited to. The older, female audience was practically wetting its pants, however. Maybe they're just not used to the crude, in-your-face humor, reminiscent of so many 'guy' movies just like this.There were some scenes that went wayyy too long. OK, I get it, it is an awkward moment, lets move on..... There's no reason to waste 10 minutes of a movie to stress how awkward a moment is. And of course, there HAD to be a musical moment where everyone breaks into song and dance together, as if they all got together the day before and rehearsed. This single moment turned this movie into a 'chick-flick' for me, sorry.On a more positive note, the acting was great! My favorite character/actress was the groom's sister! By far! Kudos! Sorry, I don't know anyone's real name. Seriously, its far too much to keep track of.If you're a female, go see this movie. If you're a guy who wants to see a movie with a girl, you could do much much worse than Bridesmaids. I did enjoy myself, and left with a smile on my face. The completely packed theater was justified. I just didn't think it was quite as good as the other reviews are saying. I was expecting to see a movie that we'll be watching and re-watching for years, judging by what others said. If my girlfriend gets it on Blue-ray, and its a rainy day outside, I'd gladly watch it with her again. I just won't go out of my way.All-in-all, I'd recommend this movie. I think most people should see it, and you can judge for yourself what you think of it. I don't want to scare anyone away because it was good. Just not THAT good (in my opinion).",7,2,5,16 May 2011
Fast Five," Excellent F&F
","The action was awesome, the cars were incredible, and it had a great storyline! There was character development. There were twists. There was some predictably, but that is to be expected. However, I don't think anyone saw the awesome twist at the end! I also really liked the falling action after the climax.Most of the characters from the other movies were in here and played important roles. There was even a new big character. And of course the ending was awesome, while still leaving an opening for a sequel.Especially if you are a 'car guy', you have to see this movie.",9,0,1,16 May 2011
