United 93," When my daughter is old enough and asks why September 11th is important....
","I lived in NYC in 2001. I saw the North Tower from my apartment. I lived too far away to hear the first impact, but I witnessed the second impact and the collapses.I had been in Tower One many times in early to mid-2001. And I met many people who didn't have a chance on that morning.This film does by far the best job of capturing the feeling of that morning. First the 'what a bad accident' to the second hit and the realization was clear what was going on, to the thought that a crash in PA was unrelated and not knowing what happened on United 93 for a day or two. And the sheer joy when they announced that all planes were grounded.And learning what happened on United 93 was almost the worst - because they knew what was happening. They knew what they faced while so many other victims that day either were obliterated or died not knowing exactly who was responsible or why.When my daughter (born after 9/11) is ready to know what happened that day, this will be the DVD (or whatever we use to play movies by then) that I will play. Hopefully she will understand the threat we face and she will hopefully ask why so many of us are taking it so lightly.An excellent film. Unexpectedly powerful and real. I wept.",10,0,1,17 April 2007
The Departed," Marty would have won the Oscar if he used trained chimps in this movie...
","I didn't see the HK original, but I was still dissatisfied with the picture.Plot holes, inconsistencies, the female lead (Jack is always fun, but is always Jack being Jack...it didn't work for me here). Damon was monochromatic, Sheen was marginal, Baldwin and Wahlberg were cartoons, (and Wahlberg has had much better performances elsewhere like Perfect Storm).The screenplay didn't use its time wisely - too much time on stuff that didn't matter and too little on stuff that did. It was like a speech where all the bullet points are treated equally and the speaker rushes through it without stressing which ones are really important.Holding it up to GoodFellas, which Scorsese really should have won for, this was NO GoodFellas. (The use of Gimme Shelter seemed like an homage to it). Marty is an Oscar caliber director. But this is not his best and was a pity Oscar. He was going to win it this year even if this was a feature length film about Tennessee Tuxedo.Oh, And the rat on the railing at the end made be laugh out loud. Subtle, that.",4,10,17,26 March 2007
