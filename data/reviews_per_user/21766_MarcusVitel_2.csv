Requiem for a Dream," Rhetoric
","Well, I'm going to write a quick review of this even though this movie isn't worth of this 5 minutes. First i'd like to say that i only watch this till the scene the guy goes to the hospital and his mother is being forced to eat some hospital food. Then I realized it was time to find something else to do.This is a plain bad movie. There is no plot. There are no characters. There are no interesting dialogs. All the scenes are in vain and yet they repeat themselves many times. I could tell this movie has lame arguments, but actually, there is no such thing here. This movie reflects nothing, all it tries to tell the watcher comes ready, like an instant noodle, nothing to think about. There is no more than a single point of view here, and a very questionable one. What is the point of this movie, seriously? Screaming stuff like 'drugs are bad' during 2 hours? This is all they do during 2 hours, screaming in a loud megaphone because this movie is exaggerated and unbelievable. Ugh. This is supposed to be a movie, to give you something to think about. I wont even write here what didn't sound real in this movie. Nothing does, actually, because the plot always develop like this: People need drugs -> Randomly, all goes wrong -> People burn in hell Avoid this and watch a real movie, this one is useless.",1,7,16,13 September 2005
Resident Evil," Yea, right..
","This movie is actually very funny while its supposed to be scary. The acting was terrible and weak, the scenes were very unbelievable, the cheesy dialog was that kind of 'filler' dialog, because they only stated the obvious. Now the even worst part of the movie: the plot, which is based in some kind of high risk experiment, in a bunker with high technology, blablabla.. Why create such a fantasious scenario? To look clever? I don't think it worked. This is why movies like this fall into joking subject. It bullsh!ts itself until nobody give a damn about the story anymore.Now the highlight of the film: the zombies! They are hilarious, none of them look to be taking this movie seriously. Many of them were laughing or trying to look scary in an Addams Family style, how fun must it have been to be a zombie in this movie!",1,0,3,31 October 2005
