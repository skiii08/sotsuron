Sucker Punch," Surprisingly dark and sad movie, but also entertaining
","Saw the movie today. It's super fun, I loved the visuals that Zack Snyder put into it, great fantasy sequences. Original plot, even if it is too simplistic and somehow muddled. The girls were super hot too, especially the main blonde chick, she's stunning Oscar Isaac as the villain is absolutely fantastic in the movie, amazing performance I think the main problem with this movie, and why I think critics didn't like it, is that it takes itself too seriously - not in the action sequences but the 'real' scenes. It puts on too much drama and deep thoughts that could be acceptable if it wasn't a fantasy action movie with hot girls shooting around all over the place! It has some philosophical lines with some deep meanings that the movie couldn't achieve by itself, so it was very pretentious on that account. There were some things that didn't make much sense to me but... F-ck it. I wish there would be 1 or 2 more fantasy sequences. Not a fan of the soundtrack either, it stood out but in the wrong way In conclusion, well made film with great visuals and nice concept that often takes itself too seriously and overly dramatic but never loses the fun 6/10",6,8,10,15 January 2015
