The Avengers," A Masterpiece of Superhero Cinema
","Perhaps the highest praise I can offer The Avengers is that it is exactly like a classic comic book story come to life. The epic scope, the hopelessly outnumbered team of heroes fighting for our lives, the diabolical villains, and action, action, and more actionit's all here in one incredible live-action package. Is The Avengers the best superhero film ever made? Maybe not, but considering the grand scale and everything that had to come together just to avoid a bomb, it's hard not to dismiss the few minor weaknesses and simply applaud what does work, which is after all nearly everything.True, The Avengers is a very long movie, and if you haven't seen the other Marvel superhero films (especially Thor and Captain America), it may take you a while to figure out exactly what's going on. But this isn't rocket science, it's a comic book come to life, and it won't take even a complete newcomer long to get up to speed.Director and screenwriter Joss Whedon has to get a lot of the credit for making the film such a success. Whedon clearly knows and loves the characters he's working with, and he wisely takes his time exploring each hero's personality. Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.) , Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) could have easily just been heartless blockbusters, but Whedon instills each of them with personal style and spirit. The banter between the various heroes as they slowly—and painfully—learn to work together is nearly as exciting as the inevitable showdown between the forces of good and evil.Nearly, that is. The climax is one of the grandest spectacles of mayhem ever filmed, far surpassing the similar final battles that have been the apex of the various Transformer movies. As in the comics, the Avengers are brought together by the machinations of Loki, Thor's evil brother, once again played to brilliant perfection by Tom Hiddleston. But this time Loki has an army of extraterrestrials backing him up, and it is suggested that there are other forces involved that may be even more wicked than Loki himself.Throw in Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, head of the clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D. organization, and you have everything a long-time Avengers aficionado could have hoped for. Incredibly thrilling, very well-acted and directed, with a witty script and heroes you can really believe in, at least for a couple of hoursThe Avengers is an instant action classic.",10,2,7,24 May 2012
Star Trek," Star Trek Torpedoes the Competition
","Trekkies rejoice! After nearly a decade of languishing on the sidelines while the Star Wars franchise enjoyed a grand resurgence courtesy of a string of prequels, Star Trek fans finally get the rejuvenation they've been waiting for. In fairness, the last two Star Trek features, 1998's Insurrection and 2002's Nemesis, were not nearly as bad as reputation would lead one to believe, and the latter was in fact quite good. Be that as it may, both were big disappointments at the box office, and with the TV series Enterprise fading away sooner than expected, many longtime fans feared the voyages of the Starship Enterprise were at an end.Not so! The new Star Trek, directed by J.J. Abrams, is a galvanizing reboot of the long-running franchise that is making big waves with old-school Trekkies and new fans alike. Taking a cue from Star Wars, the filmmakers have taken Star Trek back to its roots to tell the story of how the legendary Captain James Kirk, Mr. Spock, Dr. 'Bones' McCoy, and their supporting cast were all thrown into the maelstrom together for the first time. Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman carry out this difficult assignment with admirable respect for the many storytellers who have come before, and develop the characters and plot lines that are an integral part of Star Trek lore with great care and attention to detail, and Star Trek is full of many subtle (and not-so-subtle) homages to past films from the series.It goes without saying that in terms of visual extravaganza, the new film blows away all of the previous Trek movies. Special effects have evolved exponentially since the first attempted reboot of the saga with 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and the numerous aliens, space battles, and fantasy sets all possess an enhanced level of visual spectacle. Director Abrams manipulates all the action and drama to great effect, and if he is clearly determined to pay his respects to the movies that have paved the way for his film, he is nonetheless unafraid of taking the story in bold new directions.But a movie dealing with so many well-loved characters whose individual personalities are indispensable to the Star Trek experience couldn't succeed without some great casting. After all, William Shatner *is* Captain Kirk; Leonard Nimoy *is* Spock. How could anyone else fill their shoes with any credibility? Thankfully, the casting is near-perfect. Chris Pine has perhaps the biggest challenge of all the cast, playing the immortal James T. Kirk, but pulls it off with aplomb and brings to the part all the unconventionality and love of adventure which a young Kirk should have. Praiseworthy as Pine's performance is, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban are even more impressive as Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy, respectively, so much so that it's honestly hard to imagine any actors doing a better job unless somebody actually cloned Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley. Both men nail their roles with unerring accuracy. The rest of the cast is for the most part outstanding as well, including John Cho as Mr. Sulu, Simon Pegg as Scotty, and Zoe Saldana as a very sexy Lt. Uhura. The only question mark is Anton Yelchin's Mr. Chekhov—not only does he not look the part, his version of the character is written very differently from the original. But overall, the casting is remarkable.None of which is to say that Star Trek is flawless. There are some curious liberties taken with the space-time continuum, and the plot relies upon some conceits which don't necessarily hold up well upon reflection. More glaringly, the film's antagonist, a crazy Romulan called Nero, is a rather generic sci-fi villain who, while serving the plot well, doesn't hold a candle to his obvious inspiration, the great Khan from Star Trek II. That film is surely the best of all Star Trek movies, followed by the likes of The Voyage Home, The Undiscovered Country, and First Contact. But if it's not the very best in the cycle, Star Trek is certainly a very good all-round adventure film, and one that has restored the luster to one of the genre's most influential series.",8,0,7,1 June 2009
World War Z," Fun but forgettable
","World War Z is a movie about zombies. Lots of zombies. Enough of them, in fact, to literally take over the world.It starts with an unknown patient zero somewhere in Asia. Then there are bizarre reports of Indian soldiers fighting what they call the 'undead.' Gradually cases of a strange disease which re-animates the dead infiltrate major metropolitan areas. Our movie picks up with a sudden outbreak in Philadelphia, and we witness a generally peaceful city transformed in minutes into a sea of chaos, fear, and terror.One of the survivors of the Philadelphia outbreak is Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt). Gerry was once a troubleshooter for the United Nations, and once it becomes obvious that zombies are literally infesting the planet with incredible speed the U.N. wants Gerry back in the field. If he can discover the origins of the disease, then perhaps a cure will follow. Reluctantly, Gerry agrees. He leaves his beloved family behind on an aircraft carrier and flies off to South Korea with a team of Navy SEALs.South Korea proves to be merely the first stop on what will be a globe-spanning odyssey for Gerry, however. As he travels from one international hotspot to another, Gerry slowly pieces together a little information about the zombie threat. But can he come up with a solution before the whole world is ravaged by the undead? To its credit, World War Z tries to be more than your average zombie film. Most films of its type aren't very good, typically being badly written and grotesquely gory. World War Z isn't especially gory, and the shocks it generates are more likely to be generated by suspense and surprise rather than splatter. Pitt is a solid lead, and he clearly delivers his best effort, so that Gerry comes across as a real person rather than a superhero impersonator.Sadly, none of this elevates World War Z above the mundane. For starters, the movie fails to deliver the scale its premise dictates. With the exception of a great scene set in Jerusalem, the movie never captures the magnitude of what is supposedly happening to the entire world. The film keeps us focused almost entirely on what Gerry is experiencing, presumably to establish viewer rapport with our protagonist. But for a movie about a World War, you don't see much of the world or the war.Perhaps more importantly, the film really isn't very scary, and only haphazardly interesting. As mentioned above, there are a few suspenseful moments and it's nice to see a horror movie where something is left to the imagination, but the movie is very slow and has lots of down time where the zombies aren't directly involved in the action. The result is a movie that just sort of rumbles along, hitting a few high points here and there but ultimately failing to reach a suitable climax. Even though World War Z isn't quite two hours long, it feels closer to three.World War Z is one of those films that isn't an outright failure, but it isn't anything special, either. If you really like zombies then go ahead and give it a go—you've most likely seen worse. Otherwise, you should probably just save your money.",5,6,11,3 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek Launches Into the Darkness
","After rejuvenating the venerable Star Trek franchise in 2009, director J.J. Abrams follows his first highly successful film in the series with this year's highly anticipated sequel. Star Trek: Into Darkness is, as the title suggests, a somewhat more dangerous movie than its predecessor. Fans needn't worry, though—if the new film is darker, it's no less fun. In fact, it might be the second-best Star Trek film yet produced (the best, of course, being 1982's The Wrath of Khan).Abrams certainly has a fine eye for spectacle. Into Darkness has some of the broadest, most expansive set pieces you'll see this year. The reaches of space and hyperspace are epic vistas against which Abrams throws numerous fantastic action sequences that leave the viewer dazzled and breathless in equal measure. And when the action descends to earth, leaving the monolithic star ships behind for more solid footing, Abrams knows how to handle the smaller scale as well. The result is almost constant excitement and near total audience absorption.Amazingly, none of this comes at the expense of characterization, and really a Star Trek film that doesn't help us learn more about the iconic protagonists Trekkies have followed for so many years can't be counted a success. True, Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock are the main characters, but the rest of the ensemble cast gets quite a bit of time in the spotlight as well. Dr. McCoy, Mr. Sulu, Scotty, Lt. Uhura, and Mr. Chekhov each get a chance to shine, and every one of them adds something of value to the plot. The cast does a great job from top to bottom, starting with Chris Pine as James T. Kirk. While the 2009 film showed us Kirk's ability as Captain, Into Darkness finally forces the reckless, egotistical young man to actually grow up. Zachary Quinto is just as good as Spock, who continues to struggle with his dual identity as both emotional human and coldly logical Vulcan. Alice Eve is a welcome newcomer to the crew of the Starship Enterprise, and she imbues her character with both beauty and depth.But the finest performance unquestionably goes to Benedict Cumberbatch as the movie's villain. It's been a long time since any Star Trek antagonist has so successfully evoked pure evil. Cumberbatch embodies the darkness of the title with an eerie malevolence that must be seen to be appreciated. Every time he's on screen, he dominates the moment and every other character in the film.There are a lot of factors that make Into Darkness such a fine movie: suspense, an intelligent script, virtuoso direction, great acting, and a villain for the ages. The only marginal flaw in the film is that the script occasionally interjects humor where more sobriety would have worked better, momentarily breaking the tension. But overall, this is a great summer blockbuster and more than that a great science fiction extravaganza. Star Trek fans of all stripes should love it, as should anyone who enjoys a good action film or space opera. J.J. Abrams and his cast and crew have done the near impossible: they have created a sequel that is superior to the 2009 original in virtually every way.",Null,2,5,7 June 2013
Orphan," Be Careful Who You Take In
","It's easy to write off horror films. In fact, it often seems like many of the professionals who script, direct, and produce horror films have already done so. Many potentially good scary movies have been ruined by the very conventions of the genre: cheesy monsters, stereotypical characters, derivative plots, New Age mythology masquerading as religion, and monstrous levels of gore do not a quality production make. I think the filmmakers behind most bad horror films—which would be most recent ones—know perfectly well that what they're making is schlock, but as long as there's a paying audience, why should they change the formula?Fortunately, the filmmakers behind Orphan actually cared enough about their movie to invest some time and effort in it before turning it loose on the cinema public, and the payoff is one of the best thrillers of the past ten to fifteen years. Director Jaume Collett-Serra has taken a familiar genre plot—the wicked child who turns its home into a purgatory—and reworked it into a multi-faceted nightmare that consistently surpasses every expectation.Screenwriter David Johnson deserves much of the credit for creating a clever, spellbinding script that features strong, believable characters that are far more than victims just waiting for the axe to fall. The main protagonist, Kate Coleman, is a recovering alcoholic haunted by the stillbirth of her last child, Jessica. Kate, played with conviction by the excellent Vera Farmiga, is an extremely likable heroine that we desperately want to see achieve victory over her many inner demons. She loves her husband, John (Peter Sarsgaard), but there are problems in their relationship that are hard to overcome, and if it is clear that the two care deeply about one another it is just as plain that both have wounded one another many times before and that the scars from those wounds are always itching just beneath the surface. It is one of the most honest and believable portrayals of marriage any movie has given us in the last couple of years. But whatever their problems, both Kate and John have a lot of love to go around—not only for one another, but for their two surviving children: Daniel (Jimmy Bennett) and little Max (Aryana Engineer). But the death of their previous child has left a void in their hearts, one they hope to fill via adoption.Enter little Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a charming (if somewhat precocious) nine-year-old who establishes an instant connection with Kate and John. Esther bonds quickly with the couple, and soon all the paperwork is signed and the young orphan goes home to a new life with the Coleman's. Max finally has the big sister she's been praying for Anyone who has seen the trailer or heard Orphan's tagline already knows 'There's something wrong with Esther', but even so the magnitude of the horror ahead is shocking. It would be a crime to say anything more about the plot, but suffice it to say that Orphan is a consistently surprising, genuinely scary movie that puts most of its recent genre competition to shame. Thanks to careful story construction, realistic characters that are easy to identify with, and fine performances from every major cast member, Orphan proves that it is after all possible to still make a good horror movie.",9,1,2,28 June 2012
Pacific Rim," Pacifc Rim: Action on a Giant Scale
","Pacific Rim is the latest would-be blockbuster with anger issues. Once again, we have a movie that seems determined to show as much urban destruction as possible. This time, the combatants aren't opposing armies or even superheroes and super villains, but giant troll-like monsters and the equally mammoth robots designed to fight them off.Director Guillermo del Toro tries hard to distinguish his film from similar movies (Transformers, Avengers, etc) by not only the scale of the action—which is incredible—but moreover by devoting a lot of screen time to the characters behind all the on screen mayhem. The script delves rather deeply into the psyches of our principal heroes, Raleigh and Mako (played by Charlie Hunnam and Riko Kikuchi), a pair of pilots who operate the aforementioned giant robots, and this is a wise move: when their war machine goes toe-to-toe with a ravenous behemoth, we know there's actually someone of flesh and blood inside all that metal. This increases not only viewer empathy but suspense as well. And Raleigh and Mako are genuinely interesting characters. Raleigh is a has-been veteran who may have lost the will to fight, while the winsome rookie Mako simmers with pent-up rage and fear beneath her calm, prim facade.Though both Hunnam and Kikuchi, as well as the extensive supporting cast (which includes Ron Perlman as a shady businessman who sells monster parts on the black market), are excellent in their roles, the standout performance goes to Idris Elba as the enigmatic Stacker Pentecost. Pentecost is the commander of the world's small army of robotic defenders, a man of iron discipline and penetrating insight who will do anything to defeat the monsters that have crawled up from the ocean's depths. Elba has always been a fine actor, but this is his best showing to date.Pacific Rim's biggest flaws are a slow middle portion and the fact that the story doesn't do as much with some of its main characters as it could. The script really lets us get to know these men and women as believable individuals, but then loses them in the mechanics of the plot. At 132 minutes, Pacific Rim couldn't have been any longer for theatrical release, but I'd be curious if a future Director's Cut DVD might flesh out some of the subplots that are left dangling in the movie as it now stands.Pacific Rim isn't far from being a really excellent action film, marred only by the above weaknesses. Those points do hold the film back from true greatness, but it's still a highly entertaining thrill-ride. Where else can you see a giant robot bludgeon a lumbering ogre into submission with a boat?",7,7,11,22 July 2013
Man of Steel," A Superman with Soul
","So the aliens have arrived and are about to destroy the world. You can pick one superhero to pin all of Earth's hopes upon. Who do you go for? It's a no-brainer, isn't it? When it's all on the line, you want Superman.The last few years have seen one big-budget comic book adaptation after another, many of them quite good and a few of them truly great. But Superman, the very first superhero, has been strangely absent. Until now.And it's been worth the wait. Man of Steel is a great tribute to the most iconic comic book character of them all, and superlative summer entertainment besides. The cast—spearheaded by Henry Cavill as Superman, Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Michael Shannon as General Zod—is outstanding, with Cavill's interpretation of the character rivaling Christopher Reeve's classic performance from the 70s and 80s. Cavill grasps the heroic spirit, instilled in him by his earthly parents the Kents, that separates Superman from almost every other costumed hero, and does a fabulous job of bringing that spirit to life. Cavill's Superman is selfless, sensitive, and willing to sacrifice himself to save others if that's what it takes. The fact that Superman is more powerful than the other superheroes we've seen on the big screen lately isn't really what makes him a greater hero—it's his soul.And Man of Steel's script goes to great lengths to explore just how Clark Kent becomes Superman. Clark doesn't know where he's from to start out with, but he does know he's very, very different. He's naturally faster, stronger, and more durable than everyone else. His parents (played by Diane Lane and Kevin Costner) don't have all the answers, but strive to raise their adopted son from the stars to be moral and upright in every way. It is Clark's gradual evolution into Superman—aided and abetted by a certain beautiful reporter named Lois Lane whose interest in our hero melts into something rather more personal-- that forms the basis for the Man of Steel's plot.But there's plenty of action too, action of a caliber perhaps never before captured on film in terms of scale. The climax does indeed pit Superman against alien invaders who happen to be criminals who survived the destruction of Krypton, led by the diabolical General Zod. Zod, played with a brilliant malevolence by Michael Shannon, wants to recreate Earth in the image of Krypton, and he has the means to do it. His ultimate battle with Superman in Metropolis makes similar scenes from the Transformers movies and The Avengers look like low-grade dress rehearsals. If you're a longtime Superman fan like I am, you'll love this movie. If you're simply a fan of good action movies, you'll still love it. Man of Steel is a tremendous cinematic achievement, one that puts Superman back in his rightful place as the preeminent superhero in the world. Here come the aliens. Looks like a job for Superman.",10,3,8,3 July 2013
Ender's Game," At what price victory?
","The heading for this review could easily be the tagline for the new science fiction film based on a popular young adult novel by author Orson Scott Card. Though definitely a great action/adventure film, ENDER'S GAME is more concerned with ideas and values than flashy special effects.Not that there aren't quite a few visual treats, of course. ENDER'S GAME is an alien invasion film—sort of—and a series of short but powerful flashbacks tell the story of a nearly-successful colonization of Earth by an insect-like species known as the Formics. Nearly wiped out, the people have Earth have lived in constant fear of a second invasion in the decades since. Human technology has advanced considerably in the interim, and our space fleet has set up a perimeter around the Formic homeworld, waiting for the inevitable second war.As that war seems to draw ever closer, the veteran officer Colonel Graff eyes a young boy named Ender Wiggins. Ender displays a special military genius in the computerized wargames that are used to train potential new leaders, children being especially targeted as their younger brains adapt to new information more quickly. Graff is convinced that Ender is the key to defeating the Formic forces once and for all, and sets about meticulously orchestrating Ender's development so that the boy can ultimately fulfill his destiny.But what about Ender? How does he feel about this destiny? Is he as gifted as Graff thinks he is? And even if he is, is the life of a soldier really what he wants? Does what he wants even matter? The question of freedom is a big part of ENDER'S GAME, as the characters constantly struggle with the reality of living under the shadow of possible extermination at the hands of a merciless and literally inhuman adversary while nonetheless retaining basic human needs for liberty, personal satisfaction, and family, all of which are often at odds with the martial demands of a culture consumed with battle readiness. Moreover, the script deftly addresses our human tendency to de-humanize the enemy by basing Ender's special talent for strategy upon an apparent contradiction. As Ender himself says, 'In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.' ENDER'S GAME is well-produced, paced, acted and directed. Colonel Graff is played by the great Harrison Ford with chilling authority, while Asa Butterfield brings Ender to life with an expert performance which belies his young years. An all-round excellent science fiction that combines thrills and adventure with a rare thoughtfulness and insight, ENDER'S GAME is a must-see for any sci-fi fan.",8,2,5,8 November 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," An Amazingly Successful Reboot
","The Amazing Spider-Man marks the return of one of the most popular of all superheroes to the big screen, and for the most part it is a triumphant one. Director Marc Webb seems to have a great handle on the story and everything that should go along with it, while the script successfully addresses almost all the major plot points that a worthy Spider-Man film has to have.The lead casting is nearly perfect. Andrew Garfield is great as both the geeky, outcast Peter Parker and his flamboyant, daredevil alter ego. Peter Parker has to be exceptionally likable and good-hearted, but somewhat flawed, basically a typical teenager who may not really be ready for the power Fate bestows upon him, and Garfield nails the part with apparent ease. Emma Stone is just as fine as Gwen Stacy, Peter's love interest. Stone makes Gwen smart, vibrant, and attractive, so much so that she captures the viewer's heart along with poor smitten Peter's. Dennis Leary is perhaps cast somewhat against type as Gwen's father, a policeman who is out to arrest the mysterious Spider-Man, but he handles the role so well that it would have been a shame for anyone else to have gotten the part. And Rhys Ifans does a great tragic turn as the reluctant villain of the story, Dr. Curt Connors, whose risky scientific adventures give birth to the monstrous Lizard.The film looks terrific from beginning to end. Special effects never fail, from Spider-Man's mind-boggling feats of superhuman agility to the Lizard's bestial transformations from man to monster and back again. Action isn't quite as prevalent as one might expect—the story is heavily character-oriented, built around Peter's evolution as a person and his relationships with Gwen as well as his beloved Aunt May and Uncle Owen. But when the action does break loose, it's wild and crazy, and certainly never disappoints.But still, there are a few problems, and for the record I don't think The Amazing Spider-man ever quite equals the Sam Raimi film from ten years ago. The biggest flaw is that the new movie doesn't address the problem of personal responsibility to the degree that a Spider-Man story should. Comic fans may be disappointed to learn that the immortal words 'With great power, comes great responsibility,' are never uttered. The idea is dealt with, but a bit ambiguously, and lacks the concentrated gravitas that that simple phrase has always imparted to Spider-Man's rather tragic origin story. Less significantly, Peter's Aunt and Uncle are portrayed as a bit too young (though played by great actors, namely Sally Field and Martin Sheen), and while the Lizard is a neat villain, his grand plan seems a bit too far out, even for a comic book movie.But what works about The Amazing Spider-Man outweighs what doesn't. It's an exciting story, but one made dramatically stronger by its clear affection for its characters. Evidently the first installment in what could be a trilogy of films, The Amazing Spider-Man is a welcome addition to the Spider-Man legend.",9,2,5,20 August 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," At last, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings
","Peter Jackson's long awaited adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved fantasy novel is finally here, nearly a decade after the last installment in Jackson's magnificent Lord of the Rings trilogy was released to cinemas in 2003. That's quite a wait. The question is, was it worth it? It would be hard to say no. Jackson's film is a fine one, boasting many of the same strengths invested in the Lord of the Rings movies. The script tries hard to capture the vital essence of Tolkien's classic prose, and quite a bit of time is spent developing the story's characters, particularly Bilbo Baggins (the eponymous Hobbit) and a very angry and frustrated dwarf prince named Thorin. The fantasy world of Middle Earth is brought to a wondrous semblance of life courtesy of impressive special effects and brilliant set design, and the many terrific races and monsters of Tolkien's imagination (brutish orcs and trolls, stalwart dwarfs, angelic elves, etc.) are realized so perfectly that it takes almost no suspension of disbelief to get caught up in their otherworldly drama. Acting is terrific, and includes several of the cast from the Lord of the Rings (notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf and, Andy Serkis as the benighted Gollum). Martin Freeman is a fine Bilbo, and captures the conflicted spirit of the little Hobbit destined to redefine the very concept of heroism.But all the same, The Hobbit is a different animal than Jackson's previous Lord of the Rings films. The tone, for instance, is quite altered. One must remember that the source novel is actually a children's book, and as such rather more lighthearted than the Lord of the Rings trilogy to which it is a precursor. Jackson has to some degree emulated the book's more innocent spirit, and the film has a high humor factor as a result.The script also incorporates several of the rather silly songs that Tolkien interspersed throughout his books, musical interludes that would have seemed out of place in the darker milieu of the Lord of the Rings but which ring more true here.More, while The Hobbit includes quite a bit of violence, the action is at times given a more freewheeling, slapstick feel than it ever had in the Lord of the Rings. This doesn't always work, and sometimes matters of life and death come across as merely absurd.Also, lovers of the book should be aware that some changes have been made. These do not spoil the original plot, by any means, but are designed to strengthen the ties between this film and the Lord of the Rings trilogy. They do, however, take that original plot down a few unnecessary tangents here and there, and make for a film that is somewhat longer and more convoluted than it really needs to be.But if The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is not quite as good as, say, The Fellowship of the Ring, it is still a very good film that fans of the Lords of the Rings trilogy and lovers of quality cinema in general should certainly enjoy. And if it inspires a new generation of fans to go back and read Tolkien's inimitable original novel, so much the better.",9,2,6,21 March 2013
Prisoners," Evil is everywhere...even in ourselves
","Some people are comparing PRISONERS, the new dramatic thriller starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I don't really see that, not only because the two movies are quite different, but because PRISONERS is a much better film than the generally overrated SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.PRISONERS is the story of a man obsessed with finding his missing daughter. Apparently kidnapped along with another young girl on a rainy Thanksgiving Day (and isn't Thanksgiving the most depressing of all holidays anyway?), little Ana seems to be gone without a trace. The only clue to her whereabouts is the description of a strange RV the girls were playing on shortly before their absence. But when the owner of the RV is found, there is no trace of the girls, no sign they were even in his vehicle. The police, represented by Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal), can't find any justification to charge the man, so they let him go. But Ana's distraught father, Keller (Jackman) knows better. And if the police won't do what's necessary to find his daughter, then Keller is more than willing to take matters into his own hands.PRISONERS is an absolutely stunning film. Visually, everything is starkly understated and dreary, much like the plot. The drama is heavy and morose, which is only appropriate given the subject matter. The script delves deep into the minds of people who have lost their children and are struggling with the unbearable burden of that loss, but it also shows us what the police who are charged with solving the most heinous of all crimes have to go through. Keller is the heart and soul of the film, and we feel his pain, rage, and frustration simmering throughout the whole movie. Keller is painstakingly detailed as a good man, a fine husband and father and devout Christian, and so the questionable moral choices he makes later take on the added weight of believable pathos.Detective Loki is likewise presented as a determined, essentially noble and sympathetic cop who is nearly as obsessed with finding Ana as her father is, though unlike Keller he understands procedure and desperately wants Keller to leave things alone so the police can do their job. Without question, each role shows Jackman and Gyllenhaal at their best, and both actors certainly deliver the finest performances of their excellent careers.PRISONERS is full of twists and turns and unexpected plot revolutions that at times threaten to devour one another in their labyrinthine dungeons, and so it is almost amazing that in the end everything comes together so logically and satisfactorily. Though a great thriller, PRISONERS is even more than that. It's a movie about the moral choices we make and the line between right and wrong, and where those choices may lead us. In short, PRISONERS is a new classic of suspense.",9,1,2,31 October 2013
Mama," Who--or What?--Is Mama?
","Victoria and Lily. Two young girls discovered in an abandoned cabin in the woods, far from any other humans. The girls are wild, filthy, and have learned to walk crab-like on all fours. And they claim that while they were out there, they had a guardian MAMA, starring Jessica Chastain (ZERO DARK THIRTY) and Neill Cross, is a far cry from most modern horror films. It's not a slasher film, and the plot is built as much around character and drama as it is scares. There's little blood, and director Andres Muschietti relies upon shadow, careful framing, and the power of the viewer's imagination to generate scares instead of cheap of shocks.For the most part, it's a winning formula. Ghost stories succeed because of a certain eeriness which other types of scary movies usually lack, and Muschietti wisely devotes a great deal of screen time to building a foreboding sense of mystery around his characters and the situation they find themselves in. And those characters are believable as people, not merely victims-in-waiting. Chastain and Cross are excellent as the young couple struggling to give Victoria and Lily a home after they are rescued from their primitive existence in the forest, and naturally neither they nor the girls' doctor (Daniel Kash) believe the children's stories of 'Mama' who supposedly took care of them while they were in the forest. Gradually, however, the makeshift family seems invaded by a strange presence, a dark form that comes and goes at will and which only the girls can see.For the first half of the film, MAMA is gloriously scary. The fear of the alien and unknown is played up to great effect, and there are a number of very subtle but chilling moments when Mama's presence is definitely felt even though nothing is seen. Later, as the film builds towards its somewhat ambiguous yet moving climax, the movie unleashes a barrage of rather artificial computer generated effects that undo a great deal of the underlying mystery. Frankly, Mama is scarier when you can't see her than when you finally can.MAMA isn't one of the great horror films, but it is worth seeing. It creates a menacing atmosphere that is a world apart from gorier horror films and the storyline is inherently life affirming and a great testament to the value of family and power of love to inspire and surprise us. If you like horror films but don't want to leave the theater splattered with blood, MAMA may serve up the more subtle chills the genre often lacks.",7,1,3,4 February 2013
The Conjuring," A Movie That Conjures Up Nightmares
","So you think you like scary movies? You might want to think again.The Conjuring, based on the case files of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, is nothing if not scary. The story of a family haunted by a particularly evil spirit with plans to kill them all, The Conjuring is almost certainly the most horrifying movie that will be released in 2013.And it is superbly executed on all counts. Director James Wan lets the unfolding nightmare speak for itself, and dispenses with many of the cheap blood and thunder effects often associated with films of its type. In fact, the whole film looks a lot like a documentary, which is appropriate given that it is based on a supposedly true story. The script treats the subject matter with respect, and while I don't know if any of the filmmakers are Christian themselves, the plot retains the inherently Christian worldview underlying the narrative from beginning to end. The cast is superb, particularly Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Lorraine and Ed Warren, the devoutly Catholic couple who spent much of their adult lives investigating supernatural events and helping those plagued by otherworldly afflictions. In many ways, The Conjuring is perfectly made.But while I give The Conjuring high marks in every fundamental area of filmmaking, it's still hard for me to recommend it to the general audience without some serious qualifications. As a long-time horror devotee who has watched countless genre films of varying styles and who is always up for a good scare, I have to say that I'm not sure The Conjuring qualifies as a 'good' scare. It's not a monster movie. It's not a slasher film or really even a ghost story. The 'monster' in The Conjuring is something far worse than any of that, and the result is a film that isn't merely scary but often genuinely disturbing. The fact that it's based on real-life events and that something at least generally like the movie's plot really could happen makes it all even more terrifying.Here's a good test. If you've seen The Exorcist and it didn't bother you any more than a typical horror film, then you can probably enjoy The Conjuring. Otherwise, you're probably better advised to spend your money elsewhere.Again, I'm not saying The Conjuring isn't well done. It is. Not only is it technically well made, but more importantly it actually conveys a strong pro-Christian message, which is increasingly unusual in the movies today. The plot is involving, the characters exceptionally empathetic and at times the film is genuinely moving in a way few films of any genre often achieve. But for all that, it's not really an entertaining movie. It's scary, but it's not very fun. And I think even a 'scary movie' should be entertaining as well. Let the buyer beware!",7,0,1,29 July 2013
Prometheus," Ridley Scott and Aliens, Again
","Prometheus marks director Ridley Scott's return to the world of the sci-fi classic Aliensort of. Prometheus is a prequel to Alien, though in fact the two films are related by only a few shared elements. Viewers who haven't seen Alien won't have any trouble following Prometheus, while those who have will get to see how certain plot strands from the older film originated, but both groups should be able to enjoy Prometheus for what it is: a surprisingly intellectual thriller that will scare the dickens out of you.Prometheus is the story of a band of future explorers led by archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charles Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). Shaw and Holloway have discovered a series of ancient cave drawings that they believe are an invitation to venture out into space and meet the extraterrestrials who may have seeded life on prehistoric Earth. The powerful Weyland Corporation finances the adventure, under the direction of the cold, imperious Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and the enigmatic android, David (Michael Fassbender). The crew of their ship—the Prometheus, of course—is in the dark regarding the nature of the expedition, and when they learn alien life forms are at the heart of it all they are extremely skeptical. But their skepticism turns to fear-tinged certainty as the idealism of the star-struck archaeologists evolves into horror, for the crew of the Prometheus does indeed discover alien life—ruthless, predatory, and virtually unkillable.Prometheus takes up several divergent themes, most of them never fully answered. Where did human life come from? If aliens made us, then who made them? Does science refute God, or point the way to Him? And why might our unearthly creators decide that making us was a mistake, to be mercilessly corrected? The script deserves a lot of credit for exploring these sometimes contradictory questions, though it fails to ever really answer them. Indeed, much of the plot itself remains opaque, and the viewer walks away unsure of just why certain things in the movie happen. In short, the story doesn't make total sense.But it is never boring. Prometheus is essentially a horror film, and if it fails to equal the original Alien—a tall order, indeed—it is still one of the best thrillers the big screen is likely to give us this year. Like Alien, Prometheus gives us a strong female protagonist with whom to identify, and Elizabeth Shaw is a likable, even admirable woman who we want to see survive the chaos that her dreams have turned into. In the end, while her questions remain unanswered, she holds onto the faith in God that her comrades lack. And that is perhaps the film's most important lesson, even if an unintentional one: when logic fails, when our questions go unanswered, it is faith that nonetheless sees us through.",8,1,7,26 June 2012
The Woman in Black," Traditional Ghost Story Done Right
","The Woman in Black is an homage to the traditional ghost story. This is not merely because of the film's Edwardian setting, but due to how it is made. It is not gory, nor even violent. Atmosphere and character come first, and scares are generated more by suggestion than in-your-face shocks. Shadows conceal dark figures hiding from the light, figures that vanish before you're even sure you saw them, leaving doubt and fear in their wake so that even harmless, everyday objects are contaminated by the aura of inexplicable fear.Directed by James Watkins and based on writer Susan Hill's celebrated novel of supernatural dread, The Woman in Black is not going to please everyone. Some horror fans will be disappointed by the lack of blood. But others will be glad to find a scary movie which doesn't feel the need to hit them in the face with the same.Daniel Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, a young solicitor and single father who has never recovered from his wife's death as she gave birth to their son. Kipps is despatched by his employer to a small village and the foreboding Eel Marsh House, former home of the deceased Alice Drablow, to sort through any remaining legal papers. Kipps arrives to find the Eel Marsh estate in a grim state of disrepair, and discovers new documents to go through under every cubbyhole.But Kipps soon learns that his real challenge is nothing so mundane as legal drudgery. He hears a carriage that isn't there wreck in the bog which surrounds the house, and is a mute witness to a terrible tragedy's phantom re-enactment. And then he sees a strange woman dressed all in black walking around the house's estate, a woman who clearly isn't normal. What is the secret of Eel Marsh House? And what does the woman in black want? The Woman in Black is a dark, Gothic mystery that succeeds in producing scares without sacrificing its dignity to do so. The script isn't altogether logical, but it is at least serious, and the cast never wavers. Radcliffe is fine as our protagonist, and does a good job of conveying the appropriate sense of gloom and despair that the picture requires. Eel Marsh House itself is a Gothic marvel, a derelict structure alone on an isolated road which floods every evening, cutting it—and anyone unfortunate enough to be within—off from the rest of the town til morning. There could hardly be a better place for unquiet spirits to haunt.And the Woman in Black herself is a very unquiet spirit, one driven by a single all-consuming passion that justifies every fear the local villagers have. The lack of blood doesn't mean The Woman in Black isn't frightening—at times, it is terribly unnerving in that subtle way that only ghost stories can achieve. If you're in the mood for a traditional ghost story that eschews modern horror clichés, look no further than The Woman in Black.",7,0,0,28 June 2012
The Wolverine," The Wolverine
","A follow-up to the 2009 feature starring the eponymous hero, THE WOLVERINE is a significant improvement over that film. The sequel is better written and, despite its comic-book origins, manages to remain at least somewhat within the realm of believability. But the main factor which makes THE WOLVERINE successful is the attention to character this time around. The hero has decided he doesn't want to be a hero anymore, and the plot revolves around our protagonist's quest for a life of meaning even though he's not at all sure he wants to go on living at all.The movie starts off with a flashback to a Japanese prison camp in Nagasaki just before an atomic bomb decimates the whole city. An American prisoner—yes, that would be Wolverine—saves a young Japanese soldier from being killed in the conflagration. The years go by, and in the present day Wolverine receives an invitation from the Japanese soldier's family to visit him in Tokyo. The years have been kind to the former soldier, who went on to found a huge technology corporation worth millions. But now that he's dying of old age, he claims he has found a way to take Wolverine's mutant powers of healing from him. But though he's world-weary and ready to be done with life, Wolverine can't bring himself to agree to the strange offer. And so the old man dies. And that's when things start to get really interesting.The story works because it not only incorporates the necessary high-level action required for a summer blockbuster, complete with ninjas, serpent-like women and huge armor-plated samurai warriors, but also due to its inherent dependence upon characterization. This time Wolverine isn't just a fighting machine with a bad attitude, but a wounded man trying to rediscover a purpose in life.Hugh Jackman deserves a lot of the credit for making the plot work. Jackman is eerily well-cast as the iconic Wolverine. He doesn't just look the part, but he captures all the nuances and subtleties involved in essentially becoming another person when on screen. Jackman has the strength of personality to carry the film, and he deserves even more credit or making one of Marvel's least likable super heroes into a genuinely appealing character.Fans of the original X-Men movies should really enjoy THE WOLVERINE. It ties up some loose ends from that trilogy and eclipses the mediocre 2009 Wolverine film. While it's not one of the best super hero movies, it is quite good, and very much worth your time and money on a lazy Saturday afternoon.",7,1,4,16 August 2013
Beowulf," Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time
","The first problem this film has is that it simply isn't BEOWULF. It may be inspired by the classic saga of a Nordic warrior and his battles with diabolical monsters (Grendel, Grendel's mother, and a particularly wicked dragon), but it certainly isn't a faithful adaptation of that seminal poem. The script makes huge alterations in both the plot and characters, resulting in a story that has only vague similarities to its source. Grendel isn't a very formidable monster in this film, and his mother, as essayed by Angelina Jolie's CGI avatar, is transformed from a loathsome goblin to a devilish seductress. As for the CGI animation, I've seen both better and worse. The dragon comes across very well in animated form, and is actually one of the most fearsome looking fire- breathers the movies have given us, but the humans all look quite fake and even rather silly. Beowulf isn't the man he is in the original saga, either, where he is portrayed as an honorable and even God-fearing warrior of Good. In this film, he is not merely flawed, but duplicitous, and certainly no Christian (for whom he has little respect). Unfortunately, the film as a whole shows a similar disdain for the poem upon which it is based. Better film adaptations are the also unconventional but basically honorable efforts of BEOWULF AND GRENDEL starring Gerard Butler and THE 13TH WARRIOR featuring Antonio Banderas. As for this film, it is an unreserved failure, save perhaps as a parody of the great work from which it is spawned.",4,0,1,29 May 2014
The Cabin in the Woods," Produced By Fans, For Fans
","The Cabin in the Woods isn't one of the best horror films you'll ever see, but there aren't many genre films that are more novel. There are any number of horror movies that are undeniably scarier, or more insightful, or better directed, but at least compared to other films from the last ten years or so, probably none that are more original.Ironically, the film's originality actually derives from its awareness of horror stereotypes and its willingness to play around with them. Anyone who has watched a handful of horror films—especially so-called Slasher movies—is familiar with these stereotypes, and will probably bring certain expectations into the cinema with them to watch The Cabin in the Woods. But even as it celebrates these stereotypes, the script (by genre favorites Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon) uses them to invert the audience's experience. Everything from the cast of characters to the jump scares to the setting and expected resolution are played according to formula—to a point. But then the formula is slowly shot to pieces, exposing several unexpected subplots that turn a very conventional horror movie into something very unique indeed.The less one knows about the plot going in the better, so I won't say anything more about the script. The direction and production values are, however, excellent, and the cast (which includes Kristen Connolly, Anne Hutchison, and Chris Hemsworth) is wonderful, and the actors all totally sell out for their roles. The result is that characters that fit all the horror archetypes—the Jock, the Bad Girl, the Nerd, etc—are also believable and distinct individuals with their own personalities. Connolly is especially noteworthy in her portrayal of Dana, the obvious Final Girl, and this could easily be a breakout role for her.None of which is to say that The Cabin in the Woods is perfect. The big reveal is a shocker but also undercuts any underlying morality the film might pretend to have, if it were trying to do anything but put a novel twist on tired conventions. The dialogue is sometimes a bit too much 'on the nose,' as though Whedon and Goddard didn't always know when to let a train of thought go while they were typing the screenplay. And while the trailer doesn't really indicate it, the film is as much a comedy as it is horror, and the transition between the two emotional highs isn't always seamless.But fans of the horror genre will want to see The Cabin the Woods no matter its weaknesses, because the film is, if nothing else, a strikingly original reinterpretation of a formula that badly needed it. Time will tell if The Cabin in the Woods is really the best horror movie of 2012, but it will almost certainly reign as the year's most unique genre entry.",7,2,7,28 June 2012
