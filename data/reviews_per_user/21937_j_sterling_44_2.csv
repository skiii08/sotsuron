First Man," Waste of time
","Pure garbage with constant annoying shaky camera ala 'Blair Witch'. Absolutely no character development with Neil a sullen, introvert who fails at one thing to the next, while never talking to coworkers or family. But with an unsupportive bitchy wife acting like you should be on the way to divorce court, why would you want to talk to her. Trifecta of terrible director, writing and camera work. The only people praising this movie must be related to the stars or crew.",1,47,92,14 October 2018
Midway," Hard to describe how bad this was
","I guess Dennis Quaid, seeing his future as just an esurrance spokesman wanted to go out and prove he could be part of a movie worse than Jaws 3. I went in with expectations so low, I figured I'd have to be pleasantly surprised, but with acting worse than Daytime Soaps, ludicrous action scenes, and annoying a-hole characters, I was actually happy when the Japanese killed them, which I didn't think could ever be possible. This movie is a cliff note version of early WWII naval action made for video gamers with Attention Deficit Disorder with too many faults to mention. Terrible movie from the opening flight scene to the last cornball line. The only reason I didn't walk out of my empty theater, is that I wanted to see if the next scene could possibly be worse, and here, the director didn't fail. Crap building on crap that Hercules couldn't shovel. Purely an absolute waste of time. A complete joke.",1,39,73,17 November 2019
