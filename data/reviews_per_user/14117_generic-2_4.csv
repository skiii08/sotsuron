The Blair Witch Project," Total Crap
","I estimate that I have seen an average of 200 movies a year for the last fifty years and this is the absolute worst that I have ever seen. There is nothing worthwhile in this entire film(?). There is nothing scary, nothing interesting, nothing clever, in fact totally nothing. Why anyone would say that they liked this movie is totally beyond imagination. Most of the people who gave it a good review must have been shills for the producer. It truly is total crap.",1,3,6,26 September 1999
The Blair Witch Project," The absolute WORST movie I have ever seen. Total RIP-OFF
","This has to be the absolute worst movie that I have ever seen. The acting was awful, the story non-existent, the horror total absent. There is no reason at all to waste any time seeing this piece of utter trash. Total waste of time and money.",1,1,3,13 August 1999
The Insider," An absolute magnificent movie - best I've seen in years
","This is an absolute magnificent movie, in fact probably the best I've seen in years. Pacino and the actor who plays Wegand are superb. The action builds up and implants a real sense of impeding doom and amazing amount of realism. A really great, great movie.",10,0,0,26 December 1999
The Matrix," Terrible, terrible movie
","We read all the raves and the box office records and since we love sci-fi we went to see the Matrix. The first half of the movie was awful and we found absolutely no reason for it being made except for special effects. The story was somewhere between inane and non-existent. The second half was exciting and continued the non-existent story line. I guess there was a story of sorts but it was stupid. Probably the WORST movie we've seen in many, many years.",1,9,22,23 April 1999
