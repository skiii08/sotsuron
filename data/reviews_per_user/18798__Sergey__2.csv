The Blair Witch Project," Worst movie ever pretended to be called a movie!
","Made for $20K. I wonder what they wasted the money on making this 'masterpiece'?.... It is not worth more than $100 (price of wasted 8mm tapes).Cons: 1. Cheap (should be in 'pros' section)Pros: 1. Worst acting I have ever seen in a movie (Heather is the best they got); 2. Most brainless plot; 3. Most disappointing movie-going experience I've had; 4. Absolutely not scary, more like a funny spoof; 5. And so on, everything sux in this movie.A must see for everyone? NO: A must not waste time for anyone!My vote: 1 out 1000 This piece of wasted footage should not even be called a 'movie'.",1,2,5,30 October 1999
Titanic," Not worth the money spent on it! The first movie in the history that cost $200M and made for children!
","Very disappointed with this one. The worst ever casting simply adds more stupidity to the already thoughtless plot. I would expect more from the movie that cost more than $200,000,000. The special effects are very expensive but primitive and not really necessary for the movie.Do not get me wrong, the movie is not SO bad. It is just not worth (art-wise) the money spent on it. The movie's qualities are of a middle level. There are hundreds of movies like this one. The only thing that is special here is the budget.Bottom line: I watched the movie once (well almost once, it is way too oversized, I could not make it through the whole movie) and this is enough for me!",1,4,9,3 July 1999
