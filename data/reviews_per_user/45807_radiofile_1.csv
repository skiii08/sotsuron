Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Fantastic.. (BEWARE spoilers below)
","I'm called Bill ... and I read some hype about these films and thought - s%^t - a silly film, by an over hyped QT...I accidentally watched KB 2 and was blown away by it.. I watched KB 1 and was less impressed - but could see the point that the extreme violence has a comic book character to it. The only really jarring note to me is the end of KB1 how Oren - Ishi (SP?) is 'finished' in the beautifully snowy garden.But KB 2 has a depth and a maturity to it that still sends tingles up my spine. OK, it's not the real world but what do we watch movies for. All the actors are great .. I don't know why people dislike Pei Mei by the way, I find him an 'old school Gentleman' - merciless, but with his own rigid code of honour. He does nothing that is sadistic or out of character..oh and the humour is there also, in the first fight scene with Uma.. The music is fantastic, and it took the second or third viewing for me to appreciate the humour (maybe graveyard humour, but humour nonetheless..)Uma crossing the road after emerging from the dead, with dust flying off her clothes and calmly sitting down and asking ' may I have a glass of water please'... The first fight scene with Kiddo using a frying pan as a shield.. etc etc.. And her 'rising from the dead' was a bit of the film I have watched over and over..I am new to all this and this will do, but suffice it to say - I initially thought QT was over hyped, violent and shallow (not really knowing much) - now I would rate him are one of the all time greats. I think this is shown by the fact people either hate or love these movies.",10,0,1,31 January 2005
