The New World," Great Visuals, poor direction
","I remember seeing previews for this movie last year, and wanting to see it. It fell out of my memory until a recent trip to blockbuster where I decided to rent it. Within the first minute of the movie I could tell how the style and direction of the movie would ultimately ruin what had a lot of potential. We have all heard this story, its not new to us, but this movie portrays it in some what of a new way although fails to show what could have made this movie great. The movie focuses to much on romance, and not enough on the huge conflict that is present there. While yes the movie does include battles, starvation, amongst other things, its main theme is the relationship between a women and two different men. What makes this really painful to watch it that, the relationship is so boring, no character is established, its too predictable, and nothing really happens, thats really one of the big problems with this movie, the plot is very loose, undefined, and meaningless.This movie suffers from to much pointless narration. Mostly coming from the two main characters, Pocahontas, and John Smith. What they say has little or nothing to do with the story, and does not even do a remotely good job at establishing character for themselves, its pointless, if you want to tell a story cinematicaly, then show it!! Don't try to have the characters recite it for us, it's not a play. It would be different if the narration was helpful at all, but it is completely and underly pointless.Another huge problem with this movie is the editing. I do like jump cuts, and breaks in continuity, but they have to have a point, or benefit the story in some way. In this movie, there are horrible cuts, that break continuity, and have no point. They are obviously mistakes. Some of the characters will be having a conversation, then a cut occurs, and the blocking, lighting, and sound is completely different.My biggest problem, is the direction. In the opening scene, the movement of the 'naturals' as they observe the boats coming in, is horrible. They are human beings not apes. They dance around almost on their hands and legs like they are animals at a zoo. I understand the director is trying to make a cultural distinction between the Indians and the English, but making the Indians move like half idiots and half apes really reinforced the idea that I was watching a movie, it took me away from trying to focus on the story and I felt as if the movie was very fake.The movie does have some good visuals, and good overall photography, some good steadicam, and some decent acting, however these good things are completely shadowed, by poor story, poor direction, and some of the worst cutting i've ever seen in my life. Saving your money, trust me, go watch a better movie, there are plenty out there.",2,0,4,3 July 2006
