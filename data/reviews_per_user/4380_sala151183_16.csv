Vertigo," Near perfect Psychological thriller
","I've just watched this for the first time, I was genuinely hooked, james Stewart really pulls you in with his brilliant acting and Hitchcock really proves he is one of a kind.
Near perfect Psychological thriller as you're gonna get.
Vertigo has an incredible screenplay and the two lead actors have great chemistry.
I give vertigo 9/10",9,8,10,7 April 2019
Rocketman," Rocketman is a solid film.
","Rocketman is a solid film, Taron Egerton plays Elton John in a role we see him pull it off, I never felt he overwhelmed himself filling such shoes and doing such a great job using his own voice to sing the songs of Elton's.
I never felt the film dragged but if I had a slight negative with the film it's when they make some of the musical numbers feel a little distracted from the film and I felt a disconnect a couple of times due to this.
It's gonna get compared to Bohemian Rhapsody and rightly so, for me Rocktmen I felt the film and mostly the story was better but the musical numbers not so and that's where bohemian rhapsody came alive.
I give Rocketman a Generous 8/10",8,2,6,26 May 2019
Us," I Got 5 On It....
","Here we have a film that tries to give us a real case of classic and original horror but sadly for me this film is over thought and never quite does what we want it to do.
There are good moments from Jordan Peele, they just don't sustain their promise.
I give 'Us' 5/10",5,8,18,24 March 2019
Forrest Gump," Tom Hanks at his very best
","Forrest Gump is Tom Hanks best performance, This is NOT up for debate. It's the most Unbelievable believable film i think i ever did see, I watch Tom Hanks and i don't see him the 'Actor' in this role i just see the character that is Forrest Gump and to me this is a testament to Mr Hanks greatness. Forrest Gump makes my top 5 list of the greatest films i have seen and i have seen a million or so. This is just one of them films of only a few they i can watch over and over and it be as great as it always was. Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks are great duo but this is there very best to date. Perhaps Forrest Gump may not be Hanks best film because i believe that title is The Green Mile, Tom Hanks as an actor was a generation best and still continues to be great.",10,3,4,28 November 2015
Bohemian Rhapsody," Crowd pleaser
","I can see why this film is getting a lot of love from the public, it's a crowd pleaser.
The Music & Rami Malek is what carries this film, when the film isn't performing in its music numbers I feel the film becomes a little lacklustre, a decent film but not a great Biopic.
I give Bohemian Rhapsody 7/10",7,0,1,3 April 2019
Yesterday," Crowd pleasing....
","Unfortunately not Danny Boyle's best work, not even close.
what we get here is a crowd pleasing and predictable film.
The film wasn't all negative though, Lily James played her role well and the songs
keep this film from drowning in a 'yellow submarine' (excuse the pun)
At times it's almost feel good and maybe for some it'll be just that.
So go and enjoy this film and don't expect a slumdog millionaire.",6,0,4,29 June 2019
Toy Story 4," As great or better than previous 3 films.
","Of course we were all apprehensive about Toy Story 4 but when you've watched it you'll soon realise why on earth did I feel that way.
Toy Story 4 is not just a great film it's also as good or better than the previous 3 films.
They really capture moments with Woody in particular and the new characters fit into the film like we've always known them.
You thought Toy Story 3 ending was emotional, Errrrrr wait until you've seen the ending of toy story 4.
It's so rare to find such a great trilogy but for them to introduce a 4th film and it being just as great as the previous 3 is unlike anything before.",9,1,3,21 June 2019
Saving Private Ryan," A triumph in cinema
","A triumph in cinema, not only is this a beautiful film it's also the best war film I've seen.
This must be watched by any series film fan, the shock of the reality sets in quite early on in the film, getting to grips with such devastation makes for a hard watch at times especially D-Day the beach landing.
Tom hanks gives a truly blessed performance and the story holds up throughout.",10,0,1,9 June 2019
Aladdin," A Like for Like remake of an animated classic
","From production to the set then to the musical numbers, Guy Ritchie really captures the whole Aladdin theme.
Will Smith really adds his own flavour to the genie, Naomi Scott is near perfect as jasmine and Mena Massoud plays a like for like version of Aladdin himself.
For me this is the best live action Disney film they have remade so far.
I give this a 8/10",8,160,352,25 May 2019
Hotel Mumbai," A real intense film
","I waited what seemed quite along time for this film to finally come out and now it's here I finally watched an intense film.
I wonder how much of the film is Fiction because some parts of the film felt a little Americanised, maybe this is what I felt slightly let the film down.
Hotel Mumbai was a good film with Dev Petal and Armie Hammer who both are wonderful acting talents and in this film they deliver solid performances.
I'm glad I watched it, opened my eyes to a real life horror and just showing how powerful film can be.",7,13,40,8 June 2019
Midsommar," Could be the best thriller of the summer
","When we watch films 'like' Midsommar I have a feeling I'll go completely south in the third act, like it goes a little too crazy and a bit far.
Yeah it did go like that but it wasn't just all madness and no method which for me made this film better than some films like this one.
Midsommar I totally was all in from the start, for its long running time it didn't feel as long as that, we must credit the film for setting a good pace.
2 scenes in this film had me quite shocked, when you see you'll know exactly what I'm going on about.
Midsommar was a good film, a little madness towards the back end which was slightly too much but a part from that I quite enjoyed it.",7,0,2,13 July 2019
Beauty and the Beast," Disney did it again!
","I was very apprehensive about a couple of things prior to seeing Beauty & the Beast, the first was Emma Watson playing Belle and the other was Lafou also how the songs would flow but within 1-2 minutes of the film I was at ease and even brought tears to my eyes they captured it almost perfectly. Emma Watson Didn't disappoint me nor did the Lafou character I even enjoyed both. The show stealers though for me were Gaston & The Beast portrayed by Luke Evans & Dan Stevens. I even thought 2hrs 10 minutes ish was a long running time but it flowed along brilliantly and I was amazed at how beautifully the film was filmed from scene to scene. Better than the classic original? no! but almost a like for like remake into a live action animated film.",7,2,10,18 March 2017
It Chapter Two," So much Material
","It felt long and stretched out in parts with so much material, too much even.
Let me say I didn't hate he film or really like it, the acting, cast is what was best about the film for me.
I like my scares subtle but this just went a little too far especially in the third act.
Pennywise has his moments like the first film but it seemed they just tried to make too much of him and what was happening.
I can honestly say this film I didn't jump once although the film was aim to make for that.
I was saying it's not a bad film and the production was great, you'll probably get some loving this but unfortunately me I didn't.
It's never easy trying to follow a solid first film.
Always go and make your own opinion without making conclusions from others, listen to the reviews but don't make it your final verdict without watching it for yourself.",6,1,2,8 September 2019
Trainspotting," Did i just watch Danny Boyle Masterpiece?
","It's November 7th 2016. It was the first time watching Trainspotting I waited 20 years, was it worth the wait? The answer to that is simple! Yes! As I sat down watching the opening scene I felt oh good this will be a great film, thinking oh it won't be better than Slumdog Millionaire and when I got half way through I soon realised I was watching a great British classic and indeed it was that. With an hour or so gone I felt this was a solid 8/10 however by the end it was an obvious 9/10 and surely be in my top 30 greatest films. The cast was solid and the scenes were disturbing, Boyle has made something brilliant. It's a must see and a great piece of honest film making.",9,0,0,8 November 2016
Godzilla," Am I watching a 90's film?
","I only recently watched this film in 2019 and to me this felt very similar to how a 90's disaster movie felt back then.
I'm being a little kind giving it a 6, when it's dramatic it's too dramatic and I hoped we left that in the 90's.
It's harmless and can be ok if taken lightly.",6,0,1,30 May 2019
Green Book," Perfect Blend of Emotion and Humour
","Let me start by saying I'm basing my review on watching the film and not based on the actual facts of the true story.
Green Book delivered!!
I went to see the film twice and wanted to see if I felt the same both times, I can say It did.
Perfect blend of emotion and humour with great acting from Viggo and Ali, Viggo Mortensen's character is portrayed brilliantly in his over the top display.
Mahershala Ali Gives another great performance and maybe best of carter to date.
what I enjoyed about this film was the acting and the screenplay which had me smiling throughout especially when Viggo & Ali we're on screen together with the chemistry they engaged.
Green Book is a must see and now an Oscar winner.",8,0,4,30 March 2019
