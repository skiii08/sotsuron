Source Code," Um.
","Well, if you liked Groundhog Day and you like time travel movies, then maybe this one will appeal to you. For some reason it left me feeling a little empty or something at the end. I won't spoil the ending, but I didn't find it very fun. Also the time logic doesn't always hold together for me, especially at the end. I prefer a movie where the logic is consistent all the way through. The characters are well acted though, and the story is relatively tight. It's also a terrorism story, which isn't all that fun either, it pretty much implies immediately that it's going to be a super serious story. However, it's not a bad movie, and if you're on a time-travel binge then go for it!",5,0,2,11 June 2014
12 Monkeys," Good but Dark
","This time travel movie is definitely up there in my favorites! Brad Pitt is amazing as the crazy side character he plays. Bruce Willis completely pulls off the confusion and disorientation of his time traveling. Terry Gilliam does an excellent job crafting a heck of a strange world for us to explore.I am starting to notice a trend in time travel movies, where they end up dark and horrible. I guess maybe this is just a natural extension of what might happen if we actually did discover time travel was possible, but whatever it is, I like it! In a world of commercial movies where there's a lot of emphasis on having a happy ending, this movie (as well as Timecrimes, and some of the others in this genre) aren't afraid to show us just how scary things might get. For anyone interested in time travel movies, I recommend this one for sure!",8,1,1,11 June 2014
Interstellar," OK, but it's no 2001
","This movie is undoubtedly beautiful, there's no denying that. And the performances are good. And a lot of the plot twists are smart and I didn't see them coming.***A few spoilers ahead***However, I have several issues with it overall. For one, it takes itself awfully seriously. This is part of Christopher Nolan's thing I guess, but if you notice, all of his movies have very little humor, and freight all the cool sci-fi or thriller stuff with really, really heavy emotional things. Memento? Guy's wife raped and murdered. Inception? Dude's wife commits suicide. This movie? All of humanity is in danger of extinction and a guy is estranged from his daughter. I guess you could write these things and still let the audience have some fun, but Nolan doesn't want to let you much for some reason. Watch a few other space epics, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and marvel at how much more fun the suspense is.And also, the science gets kind of ridiculous at a certain point (near the end). It's especially egregious when it's trying to force a happy ending on us.",7,0,3,23 December 2014
Groundhog Day," Perfect.
","I don't often say a movie is perfect, but this movie is perfect! The premise seems so simple - a man repeats one day over and over - but the execution was incredible. Bill Murray is amazing. Harold Ramis did such a fantastic job of making us care for this jerk, and then follow him emotionally through this journey. One would think that the premise would lend itself to a very repetitive experience, but wow is it fun and interesting to see things develop.Ms. McDowell is great too, a very charming but also very strong female character, who shows integrity and really serves as a kind of feminist moral compass throughout the story, which is wonderful.I recommend this movie 100% to anyone interested in romance, comedy, or time travel / sci-fi.",10,1,3,19 June 2014
In Time," Overall Liked It
","I liked this movie, for the most part. I guess I felt like something more could have been done with the concept, but in the end it was neat and fascinating and a fun sort of sci-fi crime movie. I like Amanda Seyfried in it! And Justin is pretty good too. The rest of the actors sort of fade into the background for me, not bad but not that memorable either. I guess that's a good sign of a good movie. The effects worked well too, the numbers on the arms look great. The practical futuristic locations aren't exactly mind blowing, but they don't need to be for this story to work. I would probably recommend waiting for this on DVD / VOD, rather than seeing it in the theater, but I certainly wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it. Especially if you like sci-fi!",7,1,1,15 June 2014
Back to the Future," Pretty Darn Awesome
","So I guess I'm not the first person to say this, lmao, but I love this movie! It's such a gem. It has a really sweet sense of humor, and romance, and adventure to it that you don't get in movies that much anymore. Well maybe that isn't totally fair, but you know what I mean.And for a Time Travel movie, it doesn't really mess up too badly in terms of continuity or paradoxes. The movie handles it all pretty much in stride. I can get kind of nitpicky about stuff, and I never felt betrayed or hornswaggled by the filmmakers on this one.I will always suggest this to friends, and if you haven't seen it then put it on your list!",9,2,2,9 June 2014
