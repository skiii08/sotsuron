Blade Runner 2049," A truly worthy successor to one of the great science fiction films ever!
","Blade Runner 2049 is the long awaited sequel to Blade Runner, over thirty years in the making. Blade Runner is not only my favorite Ridley Scott film, one of my favorite science fiction films, but one of my favorite films period. Rarely enough, it was a movie I initially hated, due to my faulty expectations. I went in thinking it would be a sci-fi action piece, like Star Wars or Total Recall, but Blade Runner is not that at all. It's the same with this sequel. If you go into this thinking action you will be soundly disappointed.I went into this film expecting a sequel to Blade Runner, and got exactly that. This might be one of the best sequels ever made. That's difficult to say, as there are a lot of amazing sequels out there, but it makes that list of greats. I still like the first Blade Runner more, but this is for sure a worthy follow-up. Virtually everything works about this movie.2049 does what a great sequel should do. It maintains the feel of the first, but does its own take, as opposed to rinse and repeat. It also expands on the original in every aspect; the world, story, characters, and the theme of what it means to be human.The effects are astounding. You can tell the budget is on the screen. This film looks as good if not better than the original. It's bleak and atmospheric, as a Blade Runner sequel should be. The score is also great. It's not quite as memorable as the first movie's score, but it still fit the film beautifully.The cast is great. Everyone gives an amazing performance. However, the standout performance is Jared Leto, in my opinion. The only other film I him from, off the top of my head, is Suicide Squad, of which he did nothing to impress me. I thought he was the worst on-screen Joker (in live action) to date. However, he truly brought his a-game. That was the one thing I wish there was more of in this movie; more Jared Leto.The fact that this movie exists actually makes the first Blade Runner an even better movie. 2049 took the one thing I did not care for in the first film and built its narrative around it in a very creative way. One thing people might not like is that, while Harrison Ford is in all the marketing, and has second billing, below Ryan Gosling, his character does not appear until more than halfway through. I actually prefer this though, as this story does revolve around Ryan Gosling's character. This film manages to be its own contained story, while also leaving the door open for future installments.I'll admit, the movie's run time did worry me at first. I thought this would not earn its length, and be too loaded with filler, and the pacing would suffer. Some might feel that way, but I did not. Every scene in this film felt necessary, either for the plot, or expanding on the theme and/or characters.Like I said before, between the two, I do prefer the original slightly more, for a couple reasons. First of all, while the music in 2049 is amazing, I found the music in the first Blade Runner more memorable still. Secondly, the first film had one of the greatest, and most iconic, villains in movies. While Jared Leto was great he was not the main threat. The main antagonist of 2049, to me, did not measure up. That does not mean the villain was bad, just not as good.Overall, if you love Blade Runner like I do, 2049 is an outstanding sequel you should definitely go see. If you don't like the first film, then don't bother with this, as it's very much the same in terms of its feel and tone.",10,2,9,8 October 2017
John Wick," Modern Action Classic!
","John Wick is easily the best action film since Skyfall. I might even like this more than Skyfall actually. This is better than any of the Expendables films, even Expendables 2. John Wick is a badass revenge flick that knows what it is and goes all-out with it. This film doesn't try to be something it isn't or be overly complicated to try to appease a certain audience. This film is really what the film Machete should've been. Machete was advertised as an awesome revenge film that brought back classic action films, but it really wasn't. It tried to be deep and relevant with constant preaching about the border and it really detracted from what the film initially was supposed to be and it was very boring and quite disappointing. This film knows what it is and it is really refreshing. Keanu Reeves brings his A-game, as does all the side cast. The action is great and well-choreographed. The villain is badass and humorous at the same time.The story is simple and straight forward. John Wick is a former Hit-man but has been out of the game for five years. The film starts with his wife sadly dying and there is a funeral. Then he finds a dog on his doorstep which was his wife's final gift to him. Shortly after all that these mobsters start screwing with him. One of them is the son of the main villain, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), who John once worked for. Eventually the beat him up and kill his dog, which was a huge mistake. John then snaps and goes on a killing spree to get these guys back.The character, John Wick, is definitely a badass you don't want to screw with. He doesn't talk much and he doesn't need to. He lets his actions speak for him and he's merciless. He doesn't screw around at all. He reminds be a lot of Liam Neeson in Taken. This film has a very similar feel to Taken. For example, I like how it's basically John Wick verses everybody for the most part. Dafoe helps him out a bit but it's mainly John by himself wasting an army of mobsters just like it was Liam Neeson by himself wiping-out a ton of bad guys with no mercy or hesitation. There is no pointless love-interest, goofy sidekick, or stupid comic relief characters put it. It's just John Wick by himself which is how it should be. However I like this film more than Taken for a couple reasons that I'll get to.What's particularly cool about Wick is just the amount of build-up and praise he gets by everyone in the film including the main villain. What I like is that all the characters in this film seem to know each other particularly John himself. Everyone in this film respects John Wick and/or fears him which makes all the more badass. This shows that Keanu Reeves is great if given the right role. Many people trash him but I never found him a bad actor.Another thing that makes this film awesome is its side characters. William Dafoe has a smaller role as John's old friend and fellow Hit-man. Dafoe is always awesome in any role he's in. You can put him in a lame Goblin costume straight from the set of Power Rangers and he'll come out awesome. The rest of the cast is equally memorable. The side characters don't get much time but they make the most of what little they have to do and all of them have presence.The villain, Viggo, is also quite strong. I like that him hand Wick know each other, have worked together before, and that Viggo has a respect for John and is even quite scared of him. The way he describes John in the beginning and his constant uneasiness when he finds out he's back I find quite funny and awesome at the same time. He could've just been a nothing villain that was basically just a punching bag for Wick, but he has some pretty badass moments and has a presence to him. This is the reason I like this film more than Taken. In Taken the side characters weren't very strong and neither were the villains but that is not the case here.The action is great as I said earlier. The fights are well-choreographed and there is hardly any shaky-cam. It's R-rated so they go all-out and it gets bloody. The film looks great and has an atmosphere to it. The length is just right for the film this is. If it was any longer it would've felt padded-out as some action film of late have.Overall, John Wick is a new modern action classic. It is definitely worth checking-out if you're into action films.",9,9,23,29 October 2014

Unbreakable," Shyamalan's Best and Most Underrated Movie
","Unbreakable, I find to be an underrated M. Night Shyamalan film. I find the Sixth Sense to be slightly overrated, I find this film underrated. People are mixed about this film. Some love it, some hate it. I admit when I first watched this film, I did not really care for it. However, as I viewed it again and watched people's reviews on it my opinion changed. I think this Shyamalan's best film. I personally enjoy this film more than Sixth Sense and even Signs. I am a fan of superhero films as well. I like that this is a new take on superheroes at the time.The movie revolves around this man named David Dunne, played by Bruce Willis. There was a train crash where no one survived but him. Later you find out he is basically unbreakable. You also have Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a character named Elijah Prince a.k.a Mr. Glass. He is essentially the villain to Bruce Willis. He is the one who tells David about his gift. He might be one of the best villains in superhero movies.The acting is good all around. I think Bruce Willis does a better job here than in Sixth Sense. I really like his dynamic with Samuel L. Jackson's character. My favorite scenes of the movie are when those two characters are talking to each other. The other characters are alright, though I personally found David's wife to be annoying at times.The film has amazing atmosphere, which is one of Shyamalan's strengths as a filmmaker. The direction cinematography is great. Some of the ways he shoots a scene, from the way he frames a shot, to how he positions or moves the camera in certain segments made for a very unique experience you don't normally get in big Hollywood films. However, I could forgive it because this is supposed to be a darker and more realistic take on a superhero. I also really like the theme of destiny that is played up in this film. In this film, unlike in most film, destiny is played up as not such a good thing. I'm not a fan of the destiny theme in most movies, but here I think it's done right.Overall see this movie if you haven't already. It deserves at least one viewing. It is easily Shyamalan's best film.",9,1,1,25 January 2019
Captain Marvel," Not Great, But Certainly Not Horrible Like Many Say
","Captain Marvel is the newest MCU movie highly anticipated by some, and dreaded for others. This film has been getting a lot of backlash on social media long before it even came out due to the main actress, Brie Larson, being an open feminist spouting controversial comments on Twitter. The makers even admit the film is a feminist piece. Honestly I could care less about all of that. Both sides of the spectrum I find highly toxic and stay away from. I'm not highly knowledgeable with Captain Marvel comics, as I've never read them. So, I'm judging this film solely as a film on its own.So, is the film worth all the animosity it has garnered? The Short answer is no. The film is fine. It's harmless. In fact, I enjoyed it. It's not great. It's far from being the best MCU film, but it's not horrible or even the worst in the line. I can say I like Captain Marvel more than Iron Man 2 and Spiderman Homecoming, the two MCU movies I flat out don't like. I think it's better than Iron Man 3. I would put it on the same tier as the Ant Man films and the second Thor movie (yes I like that film). It's a movie that's quite entertaining when watching it, but plays things quite safe, and not especially memorable. I was struggling to think if I liked this as much as Black Panther, but I still have to say I like that film a bit more.There's a lot this film does well. The effects and cinematography look great. The acting I thought was fine. I didn't have a problem with Brie Larson's performance. Regardless of her political views, I liked her in King Skull Island and I liked her here. Samuel L. Jackson as a younger Fury was a welcome addition. He's the best part of the movie in my opinion. It's nice to see him be a main character in one of these again. Although, the big revelation we get about how he lost his eye we got was pretty lame I thought. It was cool to finally get the Skrulls in the MCU, even if their origins are quite different here.On the other hand, the villains are incredibly lame and forgettable. The big twist you could see coming a mile away. The action is okay, but nothing great. The final climax especially felt a bit underwhelming.Overall, Captain Marvel does not deserve the visceral hatred it's been getting. It's a fine entertaining film, especially if you want a good female superhero movie. It's nothing special for Marvel films. It's not quite as good as Wonder Woman was, but compared to the dark ages of female superhero flicks like Supergirl, Catwoman, and Electra Captain Marvel is a godsend.",7,3,12,14 March 2019
World War Z," A Fun Underrated Zombie Flick
","World War Z, I thought, was a nice new approach to the zombie apocalypse. I will say that this is now my third favorite zombie movie (first two being Zombieland and Scooby Doo on Zombie Island). World War Z has a much different feel to it than most zombie films, at least ones that I have seen.Brad Pitt does a good job in this movie. I think this is his best performance in a while. I like his character, Gerry Lane, because you can easily sympathize with him, and he is proactive. I like how Gerry has a military background which plays a big role in the story.The other characters are not really worth mentioning. Gerry's family is not given anything to do after they escape the city in the beginning of the movie. They just sit around on a ship for most of the film and occasionally give Gerry a call to remind us that they are still in the film. The majority of the other characters are introduced and then killed off just as quickly. The other 'supposedly' major characters do not appear until the third act, and we do not know anything about them.There are a lot of things that make World War Z relatively new and refreshing compared to previous zombie flicks. First is that rather than starting the movie off in the midst of the zombie outbreak (which most zombie films do) this movie shows us the beginning of the zombie apocalypse and all the chaos that ensues from it. Also, most zombie films take place in relatively remote locations and revolve around a small group of civilians trying to deal with the new reality. The movie starts out like that, but once they escape New York the movie shifts gears. Rather than just showing the effects of the zombie apocalypse in one area this movie takes place over several locations and how the people in each location are dealing with the outbreak.We also get a lot of scenes involving the military and how they are dealing with the situation, which we rarely see in other incarnations. There are also many action scenes with the military vs. zombies which are the best scenes in the movie. The film is titled World War Z, so I expected lots of action, and I got that. I also like how the main character is trying to find a cure throughout the movie. Usually in zombie movies it is just people in the midst of the zombie outbreak and them dealing with it. By the end he more or less does find a solution. I like that it was not all in vain. This is one of the few zombie movies to end on a somewhat triumphant note.The effects are alright. There are many instances of obvious CGI with the zombies. However there are also scenes that use practical effects which I am thankful for. The score was okay, but nothing great.People have said that the 3D is not that good. However I did not see the film in 3D, so I cannot comment on that. I also have not read the source material, so I cannot compare them. However, I have heard that the film greatly deviates from the book. Fans of the book might not like this movie.Overall, I think World War Z is pretty good zombie film. It is definitely one of my favorites of the genre. Fans of the book should use caution when viewing this, because it is not really like the book. However, I do recommend this to all who are fans of zombie movies.",7,4,5,28 June 2019
Zootopia," Surprisingly Good!
","Zootopia is the latest Disney animated film from their own animation studio. From seeing the advertising for the film I had no ambition to see this movie in the slightest. However, after seeing the positive reviews and the praise the film has been getting from people I decided to give it a look finally. I have to say this is probably the most mature animated film from Disney since the Incredibles, which is saying a great deal.Now, I thought I was in trouble with this film at the very beginning. Honestly, the first fifteen to twenty minutes is my biggest grip with the movie. You have Hopps dreaming of being a police officer and everyone else putting her down saying it's impossible, even her own parents, and she has to prove her worth. It's a theme that's been done to death in movies, especially kids movies. It's not even especially bad in its execution, but it's just very heavy-handed and formulaic.Fortunately, once we get past those first twenty minutes and we get into the mystery angle of the movie it gets much better. The mystery angle is easily the pest part of this film. The whole 'don't judge a book by its cover' theme is still present but I think it's handled in a much better way. It even goes to a place that I did not expect a film like this to go. Though, they do kind of go back on it by the end I was still amazed they went there at all.The second best thing is the characters. I really do like the two leads, Hopps and Wild. Wild is my favorite character definitely. The side characters are also a lot of fun.The animation is on-point, as well as the voice acting. Every voice fit their respective character perfectly. The action is also quite well-done and engaging. I also loved the artwork, especially of the city itself. The humor is also quite good. There were some jokes that were typical but most hit. There was this one scene where they straight-up parodied The Godfather and it was hilarious. It was the funniest thing in the entire flick.I also loved the design of Zootopia and its various sectors it has. The colors are so vibrant and the animation is great. From that to the people and their interactions with each other really brings this city alive and makes it feel like a real city.Overall, Zootopia is the best animated film from Disney since Frozen. It has a great cast of characters, a great mystery, great action, great art and animation, and a good portrayal of its many themes, adult themes, even if it felt fisted at times. I think this definitely a great film for the entire family.",7,0,0,25 December 2019
Knives Out," Harmless Fun
","Knives Out is a who done it mystery thriller directed by Rian Johnson. The same director who did The Last Jedi, and has garnered an infamous reputation because of that film as well as his reaction to fan backlash. However, this movie is much more in Johnson's wheelhouse than Star Wars. He excels in more grounded thrillers, which is what this film is. Rian Johnson is a competent director if given the proper material.This is the first mystery thriller of its kind to come out in theatres since Murder on the Orient Express I believe. I liked that film better, but Knives Out, while not great, is a fun time with a stellar cast. You have amazing actors like Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon. Daniel Craig and Chris Evans steal the movie for me, mainly because I love those two as actors. If I had to pick Daniel Craig is the stand out performance here. Yes, his southern accent is over the top, but I think was intentional. Ana de Armas does good in the movie as well. I like her in Blade Runner 2049, and I like her here too.The film is very well shot especially inside the family mansion, which looks fantastic and gives off a great sense of style and atmosphere. Being inside this house gives you the feeling you're watching a period movie, even though it takes place in modern day. Unfortunately, the outside shots don't invoke the same kind of atmosphere.This film, for a who done it story, takes a very interesting turn. It starts out as your typical who done it mystery. But then it gives you significant info early on to make you think you who the culprit is throughout the entire second act, only to spin it around again at the end. It really plays on your expectations. Though, if you were expecting a more straightforward mystery story this might not be for you.The film does get a bit slow in the middle. I'm not saying those scenes didn't need to be there, but I'm just saying the second act is slower isn't as interesting as the first and third acts. Plus a couple of the characters feel pretty stock and disposable.Overall, Knives Out is a fun mystery flick. It's not a masterpiece, but it's style, cast, and character interactions make it a fun time at the movies.",7,4,11,28 November 2019
Spider-Man 2," The Best Spiderman Movie!
","Spiderman 2 is, without a doubt, the best Spiderman film that has come out so far. That is not to say that the movie does not have its problems because it does. However, despite its issues, this is the Spiderman film that, has the best effects, has the best action, has the most heart, and most importantly stays true to the spirit of the character the most.This film almost embodies Spiderman almost perfectly. This is definitely Tobey McGuire's best performance as Peter Parker/Spiderman. I cannot say it is his best performance period because I haven't seen all of his films, but it is definitely his best performance as this character. This film really captures Spiderman and people love him even now. Everyone hates Spiderman and regard him as a criminal despite all the good he does, him trying to balance his life as Spiderman and his personal life, and no matter what he does things just never seem to go his way. That's Spiderman and that's what made him so relatable in the comics and why so many people gravitated towards him even to this day.They also handle Harry and his ark perfectly. In this film he is still trying to get revenge on Spiderman for 'killing' his father in the last film. This has become an obsession it virtually consumes his life where he does nothing else. At the end of the film you see where that ultimately leads him.
Rosemary Harries gives an amazing performance as Aunt May like in the last, except she is even better here. The scenes where Peter is talking to her about Uncle Ben's death and when she gives her speech about heroes they are amazing and the best scenes in the movie. I do not care what anybody says, Rosemary Harris is Aunt May not the one from Amazing Spiderman.Doc Oc, I think, they actually improved upon from the comics. In the comics he is just a stereotypical mad scientist with four robotic arms. In the film they make him for of a three-dimensional character. You can feel sympathy for him and see where he is coming from which are almost always the best villains.The action is also top notch in this. This film has the best action scenes of all the Spiderman films to date. Spiderman 3 had some great action as well but this, in my opinion, still takes the cake. The fight between Spiderman and Doc Oc on the clock tower and the train are phenomenal. It is the best fight in the entire franchise. The effects are amazing and really help make the action amazing. Some of the effects in the original were a bit off which hurt the action a little. The effects in Spiderman 2 beat the crap out of almost all the other films including the new ones, which is sad. Spiderman 3 had slightly better effects but is still quite close.The film, however, is not without its faults. The film, while coming close, does not capture Spiderman perfectly. Spiderman still does not use his wit enough. He does use it but not often enough. Mary Jane is still a very poorly written character. I still think Kirsten Dunst, while a good actress, is miscast. This Mary Jane is still not like the Mary Jane from the comics, is still annoying, and is still just there to be Peter's token love interest and the person he saves. She also comes off as a bit selfish in this film as well. It is not as bad as the third film but is still annoying.There is also the plot point of her and Jameson's son. That goes nowhere. I am not too familiar with the Spiderman comics but I think he had a bigger role there. Here he is simply a throw-away character. Weak!The plot-point of Spiderman losing his powers, while not, seems a little weird to me. Not-to-mention it is taken almost beat for beat from another film. I swear Sam Raimi ripped off Hayao Miyazaki. The same plot point was used in the 1989 Miyazaki animated film Kiki's Delivery Service which is an awesome movie by the way. It does not bother me too much since I saw Spiderman 2 before Kiki, but I still find that quite amusing. I wonder if it was because of Kirsten Dunst. Dunst who plays Mary Jane in these movies also voiced Kiki in the dub of Kiki's Delivery Service, which is her best performance in my opinion. Did she have some creative input she was not credited for?Overall, Spiderman 2 is the best Spiderman film easily. If you are a fan of Spiderman then definitely see this film. It has great action, great effects, great story, and it comes closest to the characters in the comics than any of the other films. You really do not even need to watch the first movie before this. I would recommend you do, but it is not required to understand this. This film is pretty self-contained.",9,2,11,5 July 2019
Aquaman," The DCEU As It Always Should've Been
","Aquaman is the latest entry in the DCEU movie list. I was excited, but nit extremely enthused about this film given the track record with the DCEU. However, I can now say I love this movie. This is now my favorite DCEU movie, even over Wonder Woman, and is now my second favorite film of 2018 behind Infinity War. This film hit every mark. It's not an overly deep or complex film, but it isn't trying to be. It set out to be an entertaining and outlandish comic book film, and it goes full throttle with it. It's essentially your average MCU movie, though I enjoyed this more than many of the recent Marvel films.The story is relatively simple. Arthur Curry/Aquaman is a half breed. His mother was a queen of Atlantis and his father is human. Now, his mother has disappeared and his brother, Orm/Ocean Master, the king of Atlantis is threatening to invade the surface. Now, it is up to him to challenge his brother to become the rightful king.The best word to describe Aquaman is spectacle. This film is a great visual and action spectacle. This is easily the best, most colorful looking DCEU movie to date. The action is a thrill and it never sops going. The film is almost two and a half hours, but it doesn't feel it like some of the other movies do. There were a couple pacing issues, but overall I was never bored watching this film.Unlike, Batman, Superman, or even Wonder Woman, I was never that big of a fan of Aquaman growing up. It wasn't until I read Geoff John's brilliant comic run in the DC New 52 that I really appreciated the character. Throne of Atlantis especially is one of my favorite stories in comics. This movie felt very much like an adaptation of that run, which isn't much of a surprise as Geoff Johns was also a writer for this film, and a producer.The cast is spectacular too. You have a cast of Jason Momoa, Patrick Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren, and Nicole Kidman. Jason Momoa especially did a fantastic job here. He was badass, funny, charming, and even charismatic. I was never sold on his version of Aquaman. His performance in Justice League didn't do much for me, but he killed it in this film. Seeing him the traditional Aquaman costume near the end was great, and it felt earned here, unlike in Man of Steel.Overall, Aquaman is a great superhero film, and just a fun movie all the way through. I can't really think of much wrong with this. Again, it isn't a masterpiece like the Dark Knight, but not every film needs to be like that. It set out to be an entertaining ride, with just enough heart to it, and it works. Even if you don't think Aquaman is cool, give this a watch anyway. You might change your mind.",9,1,2,31 December 2018
X-Men," Basic, but Quite Entertaining!
","The first X-Men movie is an entertaining film but an extremely basic film. It is definitely not bad, but it is not great either. I spoiled myself by watching X-Men United first. After watching that brilliant film a number of times watching this film for the first time felt very underwhelming. After watching in a number of times after that I came to enjoy the flick. I also thank the film for helping to open the doors to a long chain of superhero films throughout the 2000s and still going strong. If it was not for this film or the first Spiderman film, we might not have nearly as many superhero films as we have today let alone great ones. However, it is still basic superhero film compared to films compared to later movies like X2.Most of the cast does a good job. I like most of the characters. The majority of the actors fit their characters perfectly especially Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Patrick Stewart (Professor X). Famke Janssen does a good Jean Grey and James Marsden does a really good Cyclops. One thing that this movie does right that the other after it does not is have Cyclops be relevant. This is the only movie that we get to see Cyclops do anything.Some actors were miscast though. Anna Paquin does not do a good job as Rogue. I think she would have been better a Kiddy Pride. The character of Rogue in this movie is a far cry from the character in the comics and the TV shows. Rogue is supposed to be a spit-fire. This Rogue is the complete opposite of that. Halle Berry does okay as Storm, but there are plenty of people that could have played the role better.The villain Magneto is a great in this film. He is played brilliantly by Ian McKellen. McKellen is one of my favorite actors. He does great in every movie he is in whether the movie is good or bad. He got the character of Magneto down to a tee. Magneto is one of the best parts of the film. I like him because he is not really a full villain but more of an antagonist. You feel for him and can see where he is coming from. I even like his ultimate plan in the film. It is really not that bad of a plan if it wasn't for an unfortunate side effect. The other villains are very one-note and not worth talking about.The score is nothing special. The fight scenes are well done and entertaining. The effects are quite good too. I also love the social commentary the film presents, which X-Men is primarily based around.Overall, I think X-Men is a decent and entertaining superhero film. If you are a fan of X-Men definitely check it out. However, do not expect anything too deep about the film. Watch X2 for that.",7,0,1,25 June 2013
Cloverfield," A Very Innovative Monster Movie
","Cloverfield is a mixed bag. I enjoyed the film, but there are problems that I had and that others might have with the film. Cloverield is another attempt by America to do our own original monster movie. This time they used the found footage format to make it their own. Compared to other American monster movies or monster movies in general, I'd say that this is my second favorite. Though, as I said the film has problems.With Kong Skull Island being first, I'd say this is my second favorite American giant monster movie. I like this more than most Godzilla movies, and I like Godzilla. I even like it more than Pacific Rim. What makes it good for me is the different approach they took. Instead of focusing on the monster attacking and the military fighting it they focus only on a select group of average people trying to survive, get out of the city, and find out what's going on.They focus all of it on the civilian point of view of what they're going through and they show the immense destruction and casualties from that angle, which you rarely see in other movies like this. It's supposed to be more real in this is what it would really be like if a giant monster did attack a huge city. Plus it took place entirely at night which evoked a greater sense of despair and atmosphere in the film which added to the realistic angle they were going for.They also kept the monster mostly in the background or in quick clips until the end which evoked a sense of mystery of what it was or where it came from. The latest Godzilla movie tried something similar but it didn't work. It worked in this film and not that Godzilla movie in 2014 because we already knew what Godzilla was, so keeping him in the shadows the entire movie is pointless, other than to save on the budget. Here it works better because we know nothing of the monster so there's more mystery behind it. Also the character in Cloverfield, while not that great either, were still more interesting than the ones in Godzilla 2014.One complaint I have is the found footage format. I like that they tried a different approach to making a monster movie, but it did not always work for me. The point was to get a sense of realism and put the viewer right in the action like you're actually with these characters during this major attack. It was trying to be a more real experience.However, the camera was too shaky and it often did not focus on a shot long enough for the viewer to completely take in what was happening. Though I could buy it in the beginning, as the film went on, I found it hard to believe that they would not drop the camera. It would've been better if it had just been a regular movie revolving around these people trying to survive a monster attack.Another problem is the characters. I did not find them annoying, but I thought they were bland. I did not find one of them especially interesting. They weren't terrible characters. I got with them enough to be invested in the story and what happens to them, but there's nothing much to them either.The effects were good. I thought that the design of the monster was cool and looked very original. There was a ton of hype surrounding this film when the teaser first came out. People were wondering what this thing was that was destroying New York City. Some were probably let down by the fact that it was a monster. I did not get into the immense hype this film generated so I was okay with it. This film also had a great atmosphere to it as well.Overall, I did enjoy this film. However, it is not for everyone. If you can't stand the found footage style or you're not a fan of giant monster flicks, for both, than this isn't for you. If you got into the hype like so many did and wanted something more than just a monster than you'll be disappointed. However, if you just want a fun and slightly more realistic take on a monster movie then check this out. I admit I didn't like this film when I first saw it but it grew on me. Now I actually think it's fairly good despite its faults.",8,1,3,10 February 2019
Moana," Cliche But Still Fun
","If you're a fan of Frozen or other Disney classics of the past you should enjoy yourself. Just do not expect anything new story wise or tropes wise. The film doesn't have any deep societal messages like Zootopia either. However, just because something is formulaic does not automatically make it bad. It's all in the execution and if it's able to bring something fresh and unique to the table to make-up for it. Disney, Pixar, and Marvel have been able to this and Moana is no exception.The story and characters are basic and nothing you haven't seen in other Disney films, or just other adventure films. You have the title character Moana that lives with her family and tribe on this remote island. She dreams of going out there and exploring beyond the island but everyone, including her family, tells her not to. But eventually an evil threatens their home and one of her family members dies. Now she has to venture out and face this threat along with her comic relief animal sidekick (who surprisingly does not speak in this) and trusted partner Maui (Dwayne Johnson). At first the two of them do not get along but eventually grow to respect one another. It hit virtually every Disney trope.However, the film manages to make-up for this in other areas. The visuals, music (some of it), and culture the films portrays is actually something new for Disney. The lore the movie presents is also quite different and interesting. Most of all, the film has heart, which is something Disney almost always has in its films.The acting is on-point from everyone in the cast. The visuals are stunning and the score perfectly complements them. The songs are great too. They're not as memorable as Frozen or other Disney classics, but they're above average. There is one song that, in my opinion, is on that level though.Overall, Moana is definitely a Disney film, in a good way. Again, if you like Frozen, Big Hero Six, or other Disney films like them you'll enjoy this. Children will definitely love it.",7,0,2,25 December 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spiderman's Solo Debut in the MCU
","Spiderman Homecoming is the long-awaited Spiderman movie from Marvel Studios. This is the sixth Spiderman film and the third Spiderman continuity in the last fifteen years. That's crazy! After the disappointment that was the Amazing Spiderman 2, Sony was finally desperate enough to share the rights to Spiderman with Marvel Studios. Many have been waiting for Spiderman's big solo debut in the MCU. Was it worth the wait? In my opinion it was.Is Homecoming the best Spiderman film to date? In my honest opinion, no. I think Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 is still the best Spiderman film we've gotten so far. I might even enjoy the first Spiderman movie by Raimi more, even though Homecoming is objectively a better film. Homecoming is still a good movie though. It's definitely better than Spiderman 3 and TASM films.With that being said, I think Tom Holland is the best portrayal of Spiderman we've seen yet. I like Tobey McGuire alright, didn't care for Andrew Garfield, but really like Holland. He embodies Peter's shy insecure side and his confident witty side as Spiderman perfectly.The plot is very simple. A villain who calls himself the vulture is stealing and building alien tech, left behind from the Avengers, to sell on the black market. Spiderman must stop him while dealing with the trials of high school life and try to prove himself to his mentor Tony Stark.It hits all the beats of a typical MCU film. It's lighthearted and fun, but gets serious when it needs to. It's your typical stop the bad guy shtick. If you've gotten sick of the Marvel formula you might be bored by this film, but if it's a formula that works there's no need to fix it. Plus, Spiderman, more than any other marvel character, fits with this formula. This is very much how the classic Spiderman stories were told.What works about this movie, besides Tom Holland's performance, was the villain played by Michael Keaton. As MCU villains go he's really good. He's not my favorite. I still think Loki and Zemo are the best MCU villains so far, but Vulture is still fun. This is to be expected, as Spiderman has one of the best rogues gallery in all of comics, along with Batman. I also like this film's version of Mary Jane. It's a very unique take on the character, and she was fun.The effects naturally were great. You can always expect above average effects in an MCU property. The action was also fun. I still think the action Spiderman 2 and the first Spiderman was the best, but the action here was definitely on par, if not better than the fight scenes in TASM movies.Now we get to my personal gripes with the movie. First of all, with the exception of MJ, I felt the supporting cast was weak. I did not care for Peter's best friend, who was the obvious comic relief. Occasionally he got a laugh, but mostly I found him irritating. The love interest is generic and forgettable. The other supporting characters aren't even worth mentioning.The film was a bit too long as well, and felt very padded in places. Not to mention the story is entirely predictable. You know pretty much how everything will play out. The music was there, but it was not that memorable at all. I had the same issue with the score in TASM movies. The music in the Raimi films was amazing and you could easily listen to it by itself.Overall, if you were excited for Spiderman's solo outing in the MCU this film should give you what you were expecting. Tom Holland is the best Spiderman yet, the villain is fun, and the action and effects are above average. The supporting cast is weak, and the film can drag, but the film is still a really solid Spiderman and MCU film.",8,16,27,10 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," My Personal Favorite Fast Film
","Fast and Furious 6 is my favorite film in this franchise thus far. I will say I enjoyed it even more than Fast Five. While Fast Five, from a critical standpoint, is better I had a bit more fun with this film. It is amazing to see where this franchise has gone throughout the years. This franchise went from films about street racing to straight-up action and adventure films, starting with Fast Five. Some people might not care for the change but I, personally welcome it. This film continues in that direction and I found it to be the most entertaining. There is nothing deep about this film. This film will not win any awards but it is not supposed to. This film, as well as the other Fast and Furious films, is meant to entertain, and I think it definitely succeeded.The cast from the previous films all reprise their roles here. The characters are all still enjoyable and play off each other very well. I love the banter between the characters. I thought this film had some of the best comedy of the series.Unlike the previous films, this film feels more like Vin Diesel's movie. In the first two films Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) was definitely the main protagonist. In Fast and Furious and Fast Five I felt Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were dual protagonists. Here Toretto feels more like the main protagonist. I do not mind this because of the plot of this film and because I like Toretto better than Brian anyway. I especially like his scenes with Letty. Brian is still important though, and goes through his own arc as well.Letty, played by Michelle Rodriguez, is back in this film. The way they explain how she survived in Fast and Furious, I thought was lame and implausible. However, she does have more to do in this film. In the first film she was one of the side cast and did not do much. In Fast and Furious she was only in the opening. However, in this she is given more screen time, more to do, and a pretty decent in the middle and end of the film. The scenes she shares with Toretto I liked as well.The villain Shaw I really like in this film. He's easily one of the stronger villains. This is probably because he has so little competition. The Fast franchise's main problem was its villains. The villains have always been weak and uninteresting. Shaw, I think is a big step up. I like that they make Shaw the antithesis of Toretto and his code. The incorporation of Letty makes this a very personal story for Toretto like Fast and Furious, which I like.The action is very loud, fun, and intense like in Fast Five. The effects are great too. There is CGI, but I think it is used effectively. Like in the last film, this film puts more emphasis on action and gun fights rather than racing. However, there are still one or two races that are incorporated, which I found to be enjoyable. Since my theater only shows movies in 2D, I cannot comment on the 3D aspect of the film.Overall, this was a great time at the movies. If you are a fan of the Fast Franchise, definitely check this one out. The ending scene during the credits was also amazing. Like Fast Five it won't win any awards but, for what it is, it's at the top of its class as far as action movies today.",8,1,1,17 August 2019
Interstellar," I Good Space Adventure
","Interstellar is basically the more intellectual version of The Core from 2003 with much better effects. The story is very similar. In both movies the Earth is dying. To save it a secret organization funded by the government assembles a team of scientists, of which most are used for cannon fodder, to save the planet. The only differences are that instead of traveling to the core of the Earth they go into space. Plus, Interstellar is a more intellectual and thought-provoking piece than a summer blockbuster which was what The Core was. There are many similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey as well. I think Nolan really tried to make this the modern 2001 and his fans really want this to be too. Interstellar is definitely an ambitious movie for Nolan even more than Inception was. I think it succeeds in most of what it set out to do, but does fall a bit short in a couple areas.The main selling point is the effects which are breathtaking. Like films like Gravity or Jurassic Park this is a film that you should see in theatres just to experience the awesome effects. The film sounds great and has a terrific score; though it can get make scenes seem too over-dramatic at times. I will say that this is a better-looking movie than Avatar. Plus, unlike Avatar, Interstellar has more to offer than just the spectacle.The acting is also superb. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast all do fantastic performance-wise and I did like all of the characters. I even enjoyed the side cast even though most of them were there just to die and provide drama. I think this has to do with the actors and how well they sold the characters.However, I do have a couple issues in regards to the story. The story itself is great but it could've been executed better in some areas. While I enjoyed the side character, most had no reason to be there and were basically used for cannon fodder. Also the film was too long. There were many scenes and story elements that felt irrelevant. When they go through the worm hole and enter the other galaxy they have three worlds to choose from and they go to every single one which takes at least twenty minutes for each. While, from a visual perspective, it was amazing seeing all these different worlds and it did provide some drama. However, in terms of the overall the story it felt mostly like padding. The point is the movie did not need to be almost three hours.Lastly, there was one story element I was not really a fan of which ties into the ending. I know it has to do with time which is one of the main plot elements of the film. However, the way it's presented in the film is a bit weird and silly compared to the rest of the film. Plus they didn't explain it as well as they should've making it rather confusing. I know complicated is virtually Nolan's trademark, but I still felt that he made the film more complicated than it needed to be. It is already a strong film without the twist at the ending. It really felt like Nolan was trying for a 2001 ending. Even though I like this film more I do think the ending to 2001 was done better than the ending of Interstellar.Overall, Interstellar is a pretty well-done space adventure. It was an amazing visual ride, the acting was great, I liked the majority of the characters, and it had some intriguing ideas and good drama. However, some of its ideas aren't explored or explained enough I felt. Many of the side characters, while likable, feel shoehorned in. Plus the film went on a bit too long and the ending could've been better. Even with those issues I still highly recommend the film and suggest you see it in theatres. It's a great experience.",8,0,0,25 April 2019

This film has better character thus more of a reason to be invested. Interstellar is definitely an ambitious movie for Nolan even more than Inception was. I think it succeeds in most of what it set out to do, but does fall a bit short in a couple areas.The general story is very simple, though it gets vastly more complicated towards the climax. The Earth is slowly dying due to pollution and the only viable food growing now is corn. A farmer named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former astronaut who dreams of going into space, is recruited by NASA who the public think is shut down but is secretly still getting funded by the government as a back-up plan. Cooper and a team of astronauts, including a woman named Brand (Anne Hathaway), travel to Saturn where an artificial wormhole in space has opened-up that will take them to another galaxy.

Oblivion," My Favorite Tom Cruise Film In Years
","Oblivion is an interesting and refreshing entry in the Sci-Fi genre. Lately the Sci-Fi films that have come out are mainly style over substance. The Transformers films are ones that quickly come to mind. I am a big fan of science fiction! Oblivion and the new Star Trek movie are the two movies that I wanted to see most this summer. I was not disappointed with this film! Oblivion is a film that makes you think. When I watched this film in the theater I did not fully understand what was going on. When I thought about it more on the way home I began to piece everything together. I like science fiction films that can do that. This kinda film reminded me of films like Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of the atmosphere and tone. It also reminded me of films like Wall-e and I Am Legend.The special effects of this movie are fantastic. This film is able to create a beautiful looking world, and immersing the audience in it. The action scenes, when there are action scenes, are very well done.The character of Jack, played by Tom Cruise, I found to be likable and interesting and wanted to know more about. Morgan Freeman's character is also likable. The other characters though are pretty bland.Oblivion is also quite slow and has a slow build especially at the beginning. There is not much action in this movie either. The common movie viewer might not like this film, because there is not a ton of action in it. The trailer built the movie up as an action-packed Sci-Fi film with Tom Cruise, but that is not what this is. However, I find Oblivion a very refreshing and enjoyable Sci-Fi film.",8,2,2,28 June 2019
Justice League," Fun and Entertaining
","The long awaited DCEU Justice League movie has arrived, and I enjoyed it more than I expected. This film is getting critically panned and is under-performing at the box office. It's sad, because I was actually hoping this film would actually do well, despite everything plaguing it, given the surprise success of Wonder Woman. I feel that if this film had come out ten years ago it would have been praised as an amazing achievement, and would have done unprecedented numbers.However, in a world where we've now had two Avengers movies, and Civil War, many people see this as a generic, by the numbers flick, which is a valid argument. I understand those who feel that way. Even so, I found myself having fun with the movie, and I feel there are some genuinely good things about it.The plot is the same as the Avengers, so there's no point in going over it. First, I'll discuss what I like about Justice League. The film looks good, in my opinion. There are instances of sub-par CGI particularly with Cyborg, but overall I like the look of the film. When the action kicked in I was having a good time, especially during the climax.Ben Affleck as batman was really good here. I always liked Ben Affleck as an actor, and felt he could play a great Batman. His character was just characterized so poorly in BVS. Thankfully, I liked him a lot more here. You can tell the events of BVS are weighing greatly on him, and is trying to make a change for the better. I also like his costume more here than BVS. His outfit was awesome here, and he gets some good moments and fight scenes.Gal Gadot was Wonder Woman was also a plus for the movie. I liked her in BVS, her own movie, and she was good here too. She had some good banter with Batman and the others, and her action scenes were always entertaining.Jason Momoa as Aquaman was okay. I actually liked more than I thought I would. I'm still not totally sold on the look, but I found him fun enough. Though, he did have his annoying bits. Cyborg was there for me. I didn't dislike him, but I did not really care much for him either.Now I discuss the things I don't think worked about Justice League. Firstly, I'm not a fan of this version of Barry Allen/The Flash. I don't think the actor was that good, and I found the character more irritating than anyone else. I'm not even comparing him to the CW Flash series, as I'm not a fan of that either. In my opinion they have yet to get the Flash right in a live action adaptation.The villain was there. He looked cool, but there was nothing else to him. So he's basically the average MCU supervillain.The thing is, aside from Superman, Batman (sort of), and Wonder Woman, none of the other heroes have gotten their own solo film developing them as characters. Due to this it makes it more difficult to get invested in them. Much of their backstory is shoehorned in this film as long exposition. I know much of this film found itself on the cutting room floor, so there probably are more scenes in the movie dedicated to developing them. However, that can have the effect of making the film too bloated and unfocused, like BVS was. Whether you like the MCU or not, there way was the more effective when it comes to setting up characters.The final issue is with Superman. Henry Cavil is a great actor, he looks good in the costume, and I think he could play a great Superman. There are moments in this film where the Superman as he should be does come through, even if it is little. The problem is that this Superman has been characterized so terribly throughout the DCEU, especially in BVS.What's so weird about this film is that everyone is constantly saying how much of a selfless hero superman was and how much the world needs him, including Batman. Everyone keeps saying how superman is a symbol for hope and justice. Yes, Superman is supposed to stand for those things, but with how he's been handled in these movies, including this one, those claims are entirely unfounded. Even in this film Superman still seems like a muscle headed idiot who only listens to Lois Lane.In BVS everyone, including Batman, hated and feared Superman. Not to mention, Superman himself does not seem to care to much about being a hero. He even admitted it to Lois in BVS. Even in this film he still does not seem to care that much. Nowhere is that demonstrated more than in the opening scene of the film, where he gives one of the most awkward and unconvincing heroic speeches ever. From that scene, and the montage that followed, I thought this film was going to be a disaster. Of all the DCEU movies, this one had the weakest opening sequence, other than maybe Suicide Squad.Overall, Justice League is a fun popcorn movie. There are some glaring faults, with a couple being major. There are really bad things in this film, but the film as a whole is okay in my opinion. It's probably even my second favorite of the DCEU line under Wonder Woman, though that doesn't say much. It's definitely better than BVS and Suicide Squad. I'd even put it over Man of Steel (though I like MOS alright) because Justice League had more fun, was not as long, looked far more colorful, and didn't take itself so overly serious.",7,0,1,7 December 2017
Split," Shyamalan's Big Comeback
","Split is deemed as M. Night Shyamalan's big comeback as a filmmaker, and I'm inclined to agree. To say Shyamalan has had a hit or miss career would be an understatement. His first three films, Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, were all quality movies, but afterward the man entered into a fifteen long year slump starting with The Village up to The Visit. So, when Split came out we were all pleasantly surprised to find out it was actually good. Yes, Split is a good movie. Is it Shyamalan's best? In my opinion, no. Unbreakable is still his best work. Sixth Sense is also better, though I enjoyed this movie a bit more. However, this is still a solid movie; certainly the best the man has put out in over a decade and a half.The plot is pretty simple. You have three girls leaving a party but get abducted by James McAvoy's character(s), The Horde, a man with twenty-three personalities occupying his mind. Now these three must try to survive and escape their tormentor. Meanwhile James McAvoy's doctor is notices that The Horde is acting peculiar, and is attempting to determine what's happening.What carries split, and makes it as good as it is James McAvoy's character(s). Seeing this man playing all these different personalities so brilliantly is great to watch. His performance should have at least easily nominated him for an Oscar, which never happened. The film has an eerie look and atmosphere to it' something Shyamalan has always excelled at even in his bad movies. The score isn't one of Shyamalan's best, but it complements the film pretty well.Once we get to the third act it becomes a thrilling survival horror film, which is when the film is at its best, in my opinion. Usually, the third act is when most Shyamalan movies fall apart, but here it's the best part of the movie.I do have some issues with Split, however. It does feel slow in spots. Some of it does feel like padding. The film is just under two hours, when it could've been just an hour and a half. Also, while James McAvoy is a lot of fun, I didn't care much for the three main girls. The main heroine is okay, but the other two girls are nothing characters. The scenes between McAvoy and his doctor were far more interesting to watch, or when the doctor is trying to explain The Horde's condition to the other scientists.Overall, Split is a good film, and was a good comeback for Shyamalan. I hope he can keep the momentum going, though Glass has been pretty divisive so things appear shaky once again for him.",7,1,1,27 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Easily One of My Favorite Spider-Man Movies
","Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is the latest Spider-Man movie from Sony. I was somewhat wary of this film initially, because Sony's track record with Spider-Man films since Spider-Man 3 hasn't been too hot. Even Spider-Man Homecoming I can't say is that good, and that was done by Marvel Studios. I initially liked it when it came out, but it's only gotten worse over time. However, I'm pleased to say Into the Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2.The story follows Miles Morales as he learns to adjust to his new school life and him getting spider powers after being bit, just like Peter Parker. However, soon Perter Parker/Spider-Man and other spider characters join up with Morales in order to stop the King Pin, the main villain of the story. Any more explaining would dive into spoilers.Of all the Spider-Man films we've gotten over the years, this one is the most fun, in my opinion. This is mainly due to the fact it feels the most like a Spider-Man comic, which is no surprise as that is the point. The film's unique art and animation style, and the usage of comic mechanics, like thought boxes, makes the film feel like a comic come to life. It's a blend of several Spider-Man continuities each from the comics, some even I've never heard of before like Spider-Man Noir played by the awesome Nicolas Cage.The way they explain each character's story is done in a way that will make diehard Spider-Man happy, while also appealing to more casual fans (like myself) or just casual moviegoers. It truly feels like a comic event story in movie form. There was an event in the comics called Spider-Verse by Dan Slott a couple years ago (which I haven't read) which this film most likely is somewhat based on.The voice acting is good all around, though some voices took some getting used to. I didn't care for the voices of Peter Parker (both versions) at first but they grew on me. The action scenes are great; easily the best since the Raimi films. The music is also pretty good, especially the song that played when Miles Morales finally dawned his Spider-Man costume.Overall, Into the Spider-Verse is one of the best Spider-Man movies to come out easily. In my opinion, the best Spider-Man film is still Spider-Man 2 (from a pure quality and nostalgic standpoint) but this is a close second. If you're at all a fan of spider-Man, or just fun action movies, then give this a watch for sure.",8,3,6,21 December 2018
Dunkirk," Dunkirk is Okay but Underwhelming
","Dunkirk is the latest film by Christopher Nolan. As usual people are praising his film as a masterpiece. I'm a fan of Nolan so I wanted to love this film like everyone else. However, I have to be honest; this is one of his weaker films, in my opinion. I'm not the biggest fan of war movies, so that doesn't help either. I would put this over The Prestige and The Dark Knight Rises, but every other film he's made I think is better. I would even put Interstellar over this. I'm not the biggest fan of war films, so that doesn't help either. Though, this is certainly not the best war movie I've seen either. The film isn't bad, but it's painfully average.The plot is very simple. The Germans have pushed the British and the French back to the beaches of Dunkirk. Military vessels and plains are in short supply so civilian boats are mobilized to rescue the stranded troops on the beach. The rest of the film is the soldiers surviving on the beach as the civilian vessels make their way there.The film does some things well. From a technical aspect Dunkirk is amazing. The film looks great, and the effects are amazing, as one would expect from a Nolan film. It has the typical gray, bleak look to it, like in most Nolan movies, but it fit the tone of the film and gave it a good atmosphere. The music also fit very well.The action scenes are alright for what they are. This is not action-heavy war movie, but a survival war picture. Do not expect wall-to-wall action in that sense. I also like how the Germans are never seen throughout the flick, but there presence is still heavily felt. The few fight scenes we do get are okay at best. Some of the action gets confusion, and becomes difficult to tell who is fighting who.The issue with this movie is that it gets dull. This is one of Nolan's shorter films, at two hours, yet you can still feel the length at times. Some scenes feel unnecessary or are dragged out for too long.The characters are also dull. That's the film's main problem is that all of the characters are boring. The acting is fine, but the characters they are not that interesting; none of them. Cillian Murphy, a great actor, is wasted in this role. It's not that I hated any of the characters, but I wasn't invested in any of them either.That's a problem, because characters are essential getting invested in a story. If you have good characters the viewers are on that journey with them and feel what they feel. Since I wasn't invested in the characters the film did not hit nearly as hard with me as it should have. The message of Dunkirk is the same as any war film. It wants to convey to the audience how terrible war is. However, there are so many war movies that do this better because they have a better cast that resonates with you.Overall, Dunkirk is a mixed bag. It's an okay movie that's worth one watch. However, there are better war films, and certainly better Christopher Nolan movies, out there.",6,9,14,25 July 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," An Horrible Unnecessary Reboot
","Amazing Spiderman is the unneeded reboot of the Spiderman movie franchise. The very fact that this movie was even made annoys me. Firstly, I think it was way too soon to reboot the franchise. Amazing Spiderman came out in 2012, which is only five years after Spiderman 3 came out. Originally Sam Raimi was working on Spiderman 4, but due to the bad reception of Spiderman 3 Sony decided to abandon that project in favor of this movie.Honestly, I would rather have gotten Spiderman 4 than a reboot. The fact that Sony decided to reboot everything because of one misstep annoys me. The X-Men franchise has had multiple stinkers but they have yet to reboot everything. The majority of the Transformers films are bad but they still continue to be made. Despite the negative reception Spiderman 3 had the highest gross of all three Raimi movies. As you can guess I did not like this film at all. I just felt it was a very boring retread that was done better the first time with the Raimi films. Say what you want about the other Spiderman films but I will take them any day (including Spiderman 3) over this film. Those movies had problems (especially Spiderman 3), but, at least, they were entertaining and had heart.There are a couple things I like about the film that they improved on from the original films. Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, does a better job as Peter Parker, performance wise, than Tobey McGuire. I like Tobey as Peter Parker/Spiderman. I blame the writing for most of the issues I have with him. However, there are times when his delivery felt very forced and/or corny. Andrew Garfield has few of those moments, except one scene which felt very forced. Plus he looks much more like Peter in the comics nowadays as opposed to Tobey McGuire who, like the Raimi films in general, is trying to capture the old school Spiderman from when he was first released in the 1960s.Also, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy does a great job and plays a much better main female character than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Kirsten is a fine actress but she did not capture the essence of the Mary Jane from the comics at all. Not-to-mention she was just a token love interest/damsel in distress in all three Raimi films. At least Gwen Stacy was able to defend herself and was not the damsel in distress here. Plus Emma Stone does a better acting job. Some of the action scenes are also fun to watch, but they are few and far between. The action in the original movies is miles better.The biggest problem is the story. This movie is basically a retread of the original from the origin to even the villain. There are some changes but they are not even noteworthy. First of all, why did you have to retell Spiderman's origin? Spiderman's origin has already been done before (and done better I might add) in the very first film as well as various animated series that have come out over the years. The majority of people, whether it'd be comic book fans or the general public, already know the origin. There was no reason to go over it again, and there was definitely no reason for it to take up about half of the film. The origin in Raimi's film only took a half hour or a bit more while this took over fifty minutes. There some alterations but they are pointless and, in my opinion, lame. When I watched this film I was bored out of my mind in the first half.Unfortunately the second half did not do much for me either. The villain is lame and boring. He is basically a poor retread of Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) from the first film. The Lizard (Dr. Connors) is basically Green Goblin but without the energy is his performance. They were both scientists experimenting with unstable concoction that ends up giving them enhanced abilities and they end up becoming super villains. They are also both green (though The Lizard is a mutation while Norman just wore a suit). This film even ripped off the split personality thing that Norman had and had Connors exhibit it as well. Can you not come up with anything new? Unlike Green Goblin, the Lizard is just a bore. Green Goblin at least had energy and you loved to hate him. The only thing the Lizard had over Green Goblin is that his motivations are clearer. Ultimately, his main goal is just a stereotypical comic book villain plot and nothing more, which would not be so bad if the villain was more interesting and more fun. I have problems with the Green Goblin in the first film but he is a much more entertaining film and Willem Dafoe brings his A-game unlike the guy who plays the Lizard who was sleepwalking through his role.This film is also guilty of false advertising. The trailers advertised that Peter's parents would be in the movie and would play a big part in Spiderman's origin. This actually got me excited when I heard about it. Peter's parents had never been explore or even mentioned on screen before. Even in the comics they are rarely touched upon. I thought that this would be a great addition to Spiderman's mythos and would help this film stand out from the others. Instead this plot point was only teased to us in multiple parts of the film (mainly the beginning) and is left to be explained in the sequel. No! That's unacceptable. You cannot advertise such a large plot element in the trailers but do nothing with it. That's called false advertising.Even though I like Andrew Garfield as Peter I do not like this Peter Parker. People complain about Peter in the Raimi films being too whiny but this Peter is just as whiny. He also comes off as a jerk to everyone a number of times throughout this movie especially to Aunt May and Gwen. He is too downbeat is the problem. Tobey McGuire was more upbeat than him. Peter Parker/Spiderman is supposed to be a more upbeat character that uses his wit with villains to cope with his situation, which he barely does here. All of the advertising that was released was promoting a wittier Spiderman and everyone constantly raves about how Spiderman is actually witty in this, but he's not. He tells like four jokes in the entire film. Tobey McGuire used his wit just as much in the first film. Tobey's Spiderman did not use his wit nearly as much as he should have but it is not like he never used it. I can think of three or four times in each of the three movies where he tries to be witty and funny, which is about as many times as Andrew Garfield did. This is another case of false advertising. Also, I do not like the new costume Spiderman has. If there was one thing that the Raimi films got right 100% it was the costume. The new costume does not look as nearly as cool and it is too dark, much like the film itself.I have the same problem with Peter as I do with the movie in general in that he is too dark. Another major issue with the film is that it is too dark. Amazing Spiderman feels very much like Batman Begins from the majority of the film focusing on origin to the overall look of the film to the very tone of the film which is too dark. The film might as well be called Spiderman Begins rather than Amazing Spiderman. Spiderman is not Batman. They are two completely different characters. Just because The Dark Knight Trilogy is popular does not mean you can use the same tone for every superhero. Marvel Studios understands this so why can't other studios understand it. You can say that the other film (especially the first one) is too campy but they felt much more like Spiderman than this movie did.Peter, in this film, is not only too dark but he is also a moron. He is supposed to be a genius but he does not come off as smart at all in this. After he discovers his abilities there are several scenes where he shows he has powers in public places whether it'd be in a subway or his school. There are also a couple scenes where he is web-slinging in the middle of the city without his costume where everyone can clearly see him. Really Peter!? How it that none of these people put it together that he is Spiderman? There are scenes like that in the original film but they are done subtler than it is here. He also puts his name on some of his personal belongings which is how The Lizard figures out he is Spiderman. Both Gwen and her father both find out his secret too. He cannot keep his identity a secret to save his life. I know he is supposedly a teenager but he is a complete idiot in this film.Some of the casting does not work for me either. I like Martin Sheen as an actor his take on Uncle Ben did nothing for me and I did not care for Sally Field as Aunt may at all. To me, Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are the definitive Uncle Ben and Aunt May.On another note, the effects are subpar. I cannot believe that this film cost more than the Avengers. Some of the effects look pretty good but most of them are on par with the first film which came out a decade prior to this. The effects of Spiderman 2 & 3 beat the crap out of the effects in this movie. For example, the CGI for the Lizard himself is god-awful. He looks almost as silly as the Green Goblin's costume in the first movie. The score is completely forgettable. Say what you want about the score for the other three movies, but at least it is memorable. I do not remember the music for Amazing Spiderman at all.Overall, I did not like this movie at all. I know I am in the minority but I do not care. Hopefully Amazing Spiderman 2 is actually good. Say what you want about the original film, but that film is timeless, it has heart, and it is, above all, fun. I like all of the Sam Raimi films better than this film. Yes, I even prefer Spiderman 3 over this. That film was, at least, entertaining. This movie is boring, a retread of the first film, too dark, and is not that fun at all, in my opinion.",3,0,4,5 July 2019
The Fast and the Furious," Not Great But Solid
","Fast and the Furious franchise is one of the best examples of vicarious entertainment in the movie industry. Anyone who likes action, nice cars, racing, women etc. will find enjoyment from this movie and this franchise in one way or another. This film is a basic popcorn flic. There is not deep plot or deep characters here. So people looking for those elements in this film will be disappointed. However, most people probably knew not to expect such elements from a movie like this anyway, from the title to the trailers. I knew what I was getting when I watched this. So I enjoyed this film alright.The story isn't the most original. It's essentially Point Break, but admittedly done better, in my opinion. The characters are not great, though the characters are not what people are looking for in this movie anyway. The film stars Brian O'Conner, played by Paul Walker (RIP), who is an FBI agent. Paul Walker does fine overall in the film. His character I rooted for. However, I do not by for one second that this guy is an FBI agent. Nothing about his character makes be believe he would qualify for the FBI. When he tries to sound professional, it's not believable.Vin Diesel does good in the film as well. I am a fan of Vin Diesel as an actor. He is one of my favorite aspects of the film. Michelle Rodriguez is also in the film, but does not have that much to do. The side cast is fine. I did not really care for them, but I never found them annoying.The action and racing is the highlight of the film and it's done well. The races are fun, and the action (mainly car chases) will have you at the edge of your seat.Overall, I enjoyed the film. It's not a deep movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a popcorn flick meant to appeal to guys, and especially teenage guys. That's why I call it vicarious entertainment. Every guy secretly dreams about being an action hero, driving a nice car, getting all the women. So many guys secretly would envision themselves as Paul Walker or Vin Diesel's character, or one of the other character in the film. That's why I say this is vicarious entertainment.",6,1,1,17 August 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An Emotionally Satisfying Conclusion And New Beginning
","Avengers Endgame is simultaneously the final chapter and a new beginning for the MCU. It brings to a close many of the stories and character arcs that have been built-up since the beginning with Iron Man. As a grand ending, is the film worthy? Yes it is. It's a great closing chapter as well as the start of something new. As a whole the film is good, though not without problems. I think this film is inferior to Infinity War, as well as the other MCU films the Russo Brothers have directed.I thought the first forty minutes and the last hour of the film were fantastic. The acting is superb from everyone. The action scenes are great. The final fight of the film is the most phenomenal and rewarding action scene of the MCU or any superhero film. There's one scene involving Captain America that truly made me smile. With Cap being my favorite MCU character, this was my favorite scene of the film. The music is good. The effects are gorgeous. The epilogue is great. I loved what this film did for both Iron Man and Captain America. This was their film above all, and I was ultimately satisfied where their characters ended up at the end.However, the middle portion of the film is definitely the weakest link of the movie in my opinion. The film is long; the longest comic book movie ever maybe. The first and third acts felt very fast, but in the middle portion I started to feel the length. It does get a bit boring. That's not to say the second act doesn't have any exciting or touching moments. It does, but it fails to live up to the first and third acts.That's mostly due to my expectations and personal preferences. The film does go in a direction you would not have expected from the trailers in the second act. Honestly, this was the last place I would've wanted the movie to go. Not that the film does it badly, but this is a plot point that's been done so much to death in fiction, from movies, TV shows, cartoons, anime, manga, and especially comics. Most of the time it's used as crutch for writers to get themselves out of a corner they put themselves in, and I'm just sick of it. It's also something that's so easy to screw-up and makes your entire story convoluted. In this film they try so hard to make everything make sense, and it mostly does, but there are still a couple things that you call into question.I honestly think it would have been better if they just adapted the original Infinity Gauntlet comic more faithfully. They should've introduced Adam Warlock and the universal concepts. That would've been insane. They even teased Adam Warlock in one of the past MCU films. I guess they're saving them for future movies.There are also a few blatant logical issues. Infinity War had this too, mainly revolving around Thor, but this film even more so. One plot point near the end completely negates the importance of the Infinity Gauntlet itself from Infinity War. It does lead to arguably one of the best moments of the movie, but it's still a pretty big leap in logic.The last major issue I have is what the film does with two major characters; Thor and Hulk. These two characters go through dramatic changes in this film. Now, these changes do make sense from a story sense. It wouldn't bother me as much if they did more in the film. Thor doesn't do that much until the third act, which is disappointing given how awesome he was in Ragnarok and Infinity War. Hulk doesn't contribute anything fight wise, which is even more of a disappointment. Hulk was barely in Infinity War, so I was expecting a big comeback in this, but that's not what happened.Overall, Endgame is a good film, and a good ending/beginning chapter of the MCU as a whole. It's not my favorite MCU movie, or even in my top 5. It's definitely the weakest of the Russo Marvel films. The film is a bit long, and I would've gone a different direction with it. There's some questionable logic in the film, and I'm not a huge fan of where they took Thor and Hulk's characters. However, despite all that, I was mostly satisfied by the end. If you're a big fan of Cap and Iron Man like I am (especially Cap) their resolutions are emotionally satisfying. I almost don't want to see anymore MCU films after this because this wrapped everything up pretty well. Everything from the first Iron Man to now has felt like a giant continuous story arc, and now it has finally come to a close. It's the end of an era for sure.",8,1,2,4 May 2019
District 9," Good, But Not For Everyone.
","District 9, in my opinion, is Avatar done right. Both movies deal with themes of discrimination involving aliens and the main character eventually siding with the aliens and having to fight against his own people. The story and themes in both films has been done to death, but District 9 manages to do it in a way that does not feel so cliché. They both have amazing special effects. However, District 9 produced great effects with a much smaller budget.The main character, Wikus (Sharlto Copley), while I do not like him much at first, does not feel like the stereotypical hero like Sam Worthington's character in Avatar does and he feels more real. I bought his plight more and his transition from a naïve person to liking the aliens feels natural.Plus the film is very violent which makes the action more exciting for me. When I first saw it I was jarred at how dark it was so I didn't like it. However, I saw it again and enjoy much more. I still think the dark nature of the film is a bit extreme but it didn't bother me a lot once I got used to it. I definitely recommend this film, but I would caution in letting your children view it. The film is very dark and intense and not for everyone.",7,1,1,25 November 2018
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," One of the Most Underappreciated Sequels Ever
","The Lost World is a movie I feel is largely underrated by many people including myself initially. When I first saw this movie as a kid I disliked it. I found it quite boring until the 3rd act in San Diego. I've watched the film a few times in my later years and still held to that mindset. I'm 22 now. Upon watching this film several times recently I strangely found myself really enjoying it and changing my opinion on it. This movie got much better with age and now I think it is a great film while still inferior to Jurassic Park. However, there are still some issues with the film that can't go unmentioned.The story is quite different from the first film. Four years after Jurassic Park Hammond reveals to Malcom (Jeff Goldblum) of a second island called Site B where more dinosaurs roam free in the wild. Hammond's cousin named Peter has taken control of his company, Ingen, from him and is planning to take the dinosaurs off the island and put them in a zoo. Malcolm and a team of others including his girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) and daughter Kelly must go to the island to observe the dinosaurs in secret and stop Peter. However, things go awry very quickly and it becomes a battle for survival like the first film.The effects and overall look of the film is still breathtaking like the first film. It looks every bit as good as Jurassic Park despite some people saying otherwise. John Williams also delivers another amazing score that is extremely catchy especially the main theme. It's not as iconic as the first film but good in its own right.The cast is pretty good. Granted the cast isn't as memorable as the first film but I still like them fine. Some are a little bland but enjoyable and there wasn't anybody I inherently disliked. The best character is definitely Malcom who returns from the first film but is a fairy different person which is no surprise considering what happened to him in the park. When I first saw this film one of my complaints was how vastly different Malcom was and how brooding he was throughout the entire thing. However, when looking back it was a logical progression and he does still make some jokes here and there. I did find myself missing Dr. Grant who is my favorite character in the first and third movies but that's a nitpick.Many people complain that this is too different from the first film and that it didn't capture the magic of it. First of all, a sequel is supposed to be different from its predecessor and go in a slightly different direction which this movie did. Secondly, the magic of the first film can never be completely duplicated. Jurassic Park was the first of its kind to feature such lifelike depictions of dinosaurs on screen. However, now that it has been done the bar has been raised to such a high degree that nothing can hope to reach it. The Avengers has a very similar problem today. I think The Lost World comes as close as it can to recapturing the magic while not retreading the same waters.However, there are things wrong with this film as well. There are a couple cheesy action bits like when Kelly kicks a raptor out a window with her gymnastics background. There are also scenes that don't make any sense like a scene in San Diego in the 3rd act where the ship carrying the T-Rex crashes into the doc and the entire crew had been eaten by something. We never find out what ate the crew. It's never addressed.Also, there's this really boring and drawn-out scene in which one characters is stocked in the woods and eventually killed by these smaller dinosaurs that I can't remember the names to. It was supposed to be a nod to a death scene in the Jurassic Park novel I guess. This scene drags out for almost ten minutes or, at least, it felt like it. It'd be one thing if it was a major character but it's this stock bully character we don't care about. He only had like three scenes before that point.There is also this hunter named Roland who is probably my second favorite character in the film. I wish we got to learn more about him but we really don't. There's a deleted scene where he's approached to head the expedition by Ingen which they should've left in.Overall, Lost World is an underrated gem that deserves a second chance. It's not as magical as the first film but it really is impossible to be. Jurassic Park was lightning in a bottle in that it was the first of its kind. Even if the effects in future films are as good if not better and has the same feel it would still not fully recapture the first film. For those who don't like it please give it another look. For those who haven't seen it in a good while you might be surprised if you keep a more open mind.",8,5,11,11 January 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A Decent But Slightly Overrrated Film
","Rise of The Planet of The Apes is the first film in the new rebooted Planet of the Ape franchise. I am not that into Planet of The Apes. I had only seen the original before this. This movie is not as good as the original but it is still a well-made film regardless. I'm glad I saw it and am looking forward to the new film coming out next year. The film stars a scientist named Will Rodman (James Franco) trying to develop a cure for Alzheimer's because his father Charles (John Lithgow) has it. He starts by testing his new drug on apes and one of them does very well and is vastly more intelligent. Will tries to get the board to give him more funding but one of the apes goes out of control and gets killed. That ape was pregnant with a baby ape which Will adopts and names Caesar. Caesar inherited the drug from his mom so he becomes much more intelligent as he matures. However, he causes an accident and has to be put in an ape shelter. There he gradually befriends the other apes while getting treated horribly by the workers there. They eventually stage a revolt with Caesar as the leader.The film is well-made. The acting is good. I am a fan of James Franco as an actor. This is not his best performance that I've seen but he does a good job. The cg looks good in many places. The story is good and I think it is a decent start to a new franchise. It is taking what the original setup but doing something different. Instead of war paving the way for the takeover it is a virus caused by the drug James Franco's character invented. I thought that was a good way to distinguish itself. I thought the action at the end was fun and well executed, especially the scene on the bridge.This film does have some problems that do not ruin the film but are noteworthy. Firstly, the CGI of the apes, while very good in many spots, was very noticeable in some spots, especially the cg for Caesar. While the film is under two hours it feels longer. The pacing kind of drags in the middle. Aside from Will and Caesar none of the other characters are that interesting. They are very one note characters that mostly serve to make us feel bad for Caesar. Some characters had no business being there like Will's girlfriend Freida. Lastly the film is a bit too heavy-handed. The film is good but it is not something I would re-watch all the time. This is due to the fact that the film is sad throughout and it tries a bit too hard to pull on your heart strings. Again, the bad guys are very one-dimensional characters that are just there to advance the plot. This suffers from some of the problems Avatar suffered from, though this film is better.Another issue is the constant references and homages to the original Planet of the Apes. Whether it'd be uttering the classic lines or showing references like the space shuttle going to Mars. One or two callbacks are fine but six or more is not. A reboot should be able to stand on its own without drawing any references from the original movies.Overall, Rise of the Apes was a decent start to the new Apes franchise. The film is a bit heavy-handed, and some of its characters are quite bland. Despite that the film does have things that keep you invested. The acting is fine. James Franco and Andy Serkis as Caesar are good character you come to invest in. The action scenes at the end are fun to watch. The story is competent and I like this new angle this film takes on a classic story. If you like Planet of the Apes then you should check this out and the newest film coming if you like it.",7,0,1,17 July 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Worth The Six Year Long Wait
","Avengers Infinity War is the long awaited confrontation of the entire MCU, built up since phase one. Ever since the first Avengers this film has been hyped up; six years of hype. Is it worth it? For the most part yes, in my opinion. I will say this is by far the best Avengers movie. This probably now in my top favorite MCU along with Civil War and Winter Soldier, which the Russo Brothers directed all three. I will say, Civil War is still probably my favorite MCU movie, but Infinity War is close. It's either number two or three.The general plot is simple. Thanos is on a crusade to obtain the infinity stones so he can destroy half the life in the universe. Now it's up to the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop him. That's the simplified plot.There's so much this movie does right. First of all is the size of it. This is a huge movie, which it should be since it's based off a huge story arc. This movie felt like a comic book event story come to life, which no other comic book movie has done before. The effects are on point. The action is on point, particularly the big fight in Wakanda. Everyone gives a solid to a great performance, especially Josh Brolin as Thanos. The music was good as well. It perfectly served the film.The film does a great job balancing characters too. Having to balance a cast of this size, from all these other movies, is a daunting task, but the Russo Brothers managed to pull it off for the most part. There were a couple characters I wish had more time, but mostly the characters were all well utilized.Thanos is the easily the best villain in the MCU. Before it was Loki and Zemo, but Thanos blows them out of the water. He is easily the most powerful villain in this universe thus far. The sense of danger is always present with him. This guy has a body count; a high body count. He's not your typical one-dimensional villain either. He's an actual character with some depth, like Loki and Zemo.The ending is also quite ballsy for Marvel. Given that MCU films up until now have been fun and have played things fairly safe, with the possible exception of Civil War, I was surprised they ended like this. I'm equally shocked Disney approved it. If this ending actually sticks going forward; if it's permanent I will commend Disney and Marvel for having balls of steel, but it won't be. We all know this ending will be undone in future movies.However, even Marvel knows they can't just undo the ending and call it a day. What would be the point then? People would say it's a major copout, and would render this film irrelevant. There has to be more. I'm curious to see how Marvel will handle this down the line. I honestly don't know where this is all going, which I guess is a compliment to the film.I do have grievances with the film. In the grand scheme these are minor complaints, but they bug nonetheless. First is the lack of Hawkeye and Ant Man. They do mention both of them, but neither appears in the film, which is a disappointment. I know Ant Man and the Wasp is coming out, but I would still like them to be here since this is supposed to be the movie to united all the heroes from the MCU so far. They were both in Civil War, so they should've been here.The Hulk doesn't appear much either, which was really surprising for me. He has a cool moment at the very beginning, but then never appears again. There are some scenes of him in the final battle, but they're not in the movie. That sucks, because the Hulk is one of my favorites. He did more in Thor Ragnarok.On that subject, this film does make the ending of Ragnarok irrelevant. I don't love Ragnarok, but I do like it, so it was slightly disheartening that Infinity War essentially made that film irrelevant. Also, Thor's power level was kid of all over the place in this film. This guy was able to survive in space with no air and without freezing. I didn't know he could do that. He also took the force of a dying star and lived. The man has some insane plot armor on him in this film.Thor's entire subplot in this film felt a bit pointless. If there was a slightly boring and filler-like bit in this film it would be Thor's quest. It ultimately didn't amount to much.There were a few plot contrivances too; one involving Star Lord and his group. I can't get into that without spoilers. Another is an issue that always comes up in any story when you introduce a villain like this. When you have a villain this powerful, where he's essentially God, there shouldn't be a fight. Thanos should destroy everybody with no struggle and the movie would be over in ten minutes. But they have to nerf him a bit to give the heroes a fighting chance. That's really a nitpick, but it just bugs me a little.Overall, despite my issues, Infinity War is an amazing ride. It's one of my favorite MCU films to date now. My problems are really minor, and mostly my personal grievances. The film was very much worth the hype.",9,0,2,25 November 2018
Frozen," Disney's Big Comeback In Animation
","Frozen, in my opinion, is probably the best Disney animated movie not made by Pixar to come out since the Lion King. The Lion King was the peak of Disney animation. After that Disney animated films were on the decline and Pixar took over for a while. However, that could be about to change. If Disney continues to put out movies as good as or better than Frozen then we may have another Disney golden age.Frozen is the story of the Ice Queen but told from a different angle. When you think of the ice queen you think that she is the villain. However, in Frozen she is not evil but more misunderstood, which I did not expect. This story could be really fun or feel really forced. Fortunately this movie was extremely fun, well-paced, well-acted, and well animated. The characters are really fun and relatable.Most of the songs were also good. One of the things I love about this film is that it is a Disney animated film not a Pixar film. Frozen is a Disney 2D animated film in 3D animation. While in 3D animation this film is not a comedy like most of them are. It has much humor in it, but it places focus on the story and the dramatic moments more than humor. Plus it is a musical like the old Disney films, which is a welcome change. I also like how they make fun of past Disney tropes like a prince and princess falling in love instantly without getting to know one another.There are some issues I have with the film, though most are minor. Firstly, I kind of wish this was done in 2D animation. I do not dislike 3D animation, but I do like the 2D style of animation more. Plus, I am so used to pure Disney animated movies like this in 2D that seeing one in 3D did not entirely click with me. That one is more of a personal preference I know.Another problem I have is with the villain. The problem is that they reveal who the main villain is in the third act. To be honest it really comes out of nowhere. Not to mention the villain is very bland. I have seen this villain in many Disney films and even films in general. I get what they were going for with the reveal, but I still did not really care for it and thought it was too out of left field.Overall, Frozen is Disney's best animated films of the decade (maybe two decades) that isn't made by Pixar. It is fun and funny when it wants to be and dark and serious when it needs to be. The characters (save one) are all likable and fun to watch. The effects were amazing and very well done. I do have some gripes but they're really just nitpicks. I recommend going to see this and I highly recommend taking your kids to see this.",8,1,3,25 December 2019
1917," A New Film Experience
","1917 is the latest Oscar bait war movie to come out, though this time set in World War 1. Most of these films like to be set in World War 2 or Vietnam, or even Iraq. The only other film in recent memory set in WWI is Wonder Woman, which barely counts as a war movie. I'm personally not the biggest fan of war movies. They can get boring, and many of them tend to feel the same. The last war movie I saw in theaters was Dunkirk, which everyone adored except me. I thought movie was a boring slog. There are some war films I really like though, such as Apocalypse Now and We Are Soldiers. The ones I enjoy the most tend to be ones like Wonder Woman and Overlord where the war is just the backdrop. It isn't the main story. Apocalypse Now could fall into that category as well.Is this movie good? Yes. As war movies go this one is definitely solid, if not above average. The performances were good. The cinematography is amazing. The score, coupled with the set pieces, give the film a very eerie and tension-filled atmosphere.The thing that stands out the most about this film is the way it's shot. This film is made to seem like it was filmed in one take, or at least two takes, even though that's not the case. I don't know how they did it, but they truly made it look like they shot the entire film all in one go. I don't think I've seen another movie shot like this. This sets 1917 apart not just from other war movies, but other films in general. Because of this it truly feels like you're taking this journey along with our lead characters, and it almost never gives you time to breathe.If you're looking for lots of action, which is typical for a film like this, you're not going to get much of it. While it has its action, this is much more of a thriller than an action piece. I find it funny that a movie like Dunkirk had much more action in it, yet I was more engaged by this movie than that one. This probably because you're with the characters much more in this film and you get to see them constantly struggle against overwhelming odds all alone. Dunkirk was much more focused on its massive action that the characters got lost in all of it.There's not much characterization here either. However, because we're with these characters for literally the entire film I was able connect with them and their plights much more. The performances by the lead actors helped as well. I felt the acting was pretty flat all around in Dunkirk.Overall, if you like war movies then this is definitely a must see. If you just want to see a good thriller then this is worth checking out as well.",8,7,10,16 January 2020
Big Hero 6," Disney Animated Marvel Movie
","Big Hero 6 is essentially the animated Guardians of the Galaxy. Both movies were based on obscure comics that few people knew about but became very successful. Even the cast in this film, very much, reminds me of the characters in Guardians. All-in-all Big Hero 6 is a very fun ride with memorable characters and a brilliant looking world. However, there are a couple issues that prevent it from being perfect.First of all, the film looks amazing. This really uses its 3D animation to the fullest. The designs are awesome and so is the science being employed here even if it is out there. However, this is a world where this type of science is possible so I rolled with it. The film has a great score and soundtrack which really helps get you pumped especially during the action scenes. When this film gets going it's a very fun ride.However, what truly drives this movie is its characters. Now, the main character, Hero, I actually thought was rather bland. He was, by no means, bad, but I found him the weakest of the primary cast. Hero's friends are all awesome. You have a superhero fanboy named Fred, a neat freak named Wasabi, chemistry whiz named Honey Lemon, and an adrenaline junkie named Go Go Tamago. Wasabi and Tamago are especially awesome to me. Tamago reminds me of Raven from the Teen Titans animated series. Wasabi is my second favorite character. His jokes, to me, were hilarious and he can be a badass too.Lastly you have Baymax who is my favorite character in the entire film. He is hilarious, badass, and just very lovable. The way him and Hero play of each other is also very well-done. His design is also great. It's simple but effective.Now, I do have a couple issues with this movie. It is a Disney film and you can see their fingerprints on this. Some of the classic Disney animated tropes are here mainly in the beginning and the end. There is a character who you know is going to die the minute he's introduced. Also it's pretty easy to guess who the villain is. They try to throw you for a loop with who it is in the first half, but it wasn't that hard to guess. In the beginning it really came down to two possible people and I could easily guess which one it was long before we got halfway through which brings me to my next point.The villain himself I thought was weak. I love his costume, but, as a character, I didn't find him that interesting. He has a typical revenge motive which I find tired. In Disney films the villain's motive is usually revenge or to gain power. The motivation wouldn't matter as much if he had more presence to him. Disney villains of the past had flimsy motivations but they leave a big impact on you like Jafar, Scar, Maleficent, and so on, but he doesn't.Also, the ending could've been trimmed down a bit. There is one scene after they defeat the villain where they have to go save this one character that has only had one scene prior so we have no emotional attachment to. The scene only seem to have been there to have a heartfelt moment where you think one of the main characters is dead but he comes back almost immediately after which makes that scene pretty much pointless. Unless that character they save becomes important in the sequel I see not importance to that scene other than to have a token heartfelt moment that every Disney film needs to have.Overall, Big Hero 6, like Guardians of The Galaxy, is a fun ride that both children and adults can enjoy. The characters are memorable, it looks amazing, the action is good, and it has plenty of funny and heartfelt moments. If you like films like Guardians then definitely give this a look.",7,1,1,25 December 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Modern Day Star Wars
","Guardians of The Galaxy, while not the best film released by Marvel Studios, is probably one of the most fun Marvel movie to date. This is probably the second most enjoyable of these movies to me below Thor. This film was a surprise and I'm glad that this seems to be catching on. This is Marvel's most risky project by far. Not only was this subject matter virtually unknown to the public eye before this but it is also not really a superhero film which Marvel has been associated with up until now. This is basically a Sci-Fi adventure flick set in the Marvel Universe.However, while this film may seem like just a side story unrelated to events in the other movies so far, it is actually necessary in that it further elaborates on certain elements introduced in the other movies in this universe like Thanos and it serves to expand the Marvel Universe and make it more of an actual universe. You also have The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) who cameoed in Thor TDW make a cameo here as well. In that aspect this was a great subject matter to adapt while a risky one and it seems to have paid off.Guardians of The Galaxy is the Star Wars of the current generation. It is a basic science fiction/fantasy adventure story which is sometimes all you need. Lately we've become so wrapped-up in complicated and dark stories that it is nice to have a simple and fun movie that everyone can enjoy if it is done right. That's one of the reasons why movies like Star Wars, Titanic, and The Avengers were so successful and why this one will most likely be a success. Beyond that, this film is very similar to Star Wars in many aspects. You have a group of unlikely heroes going up against a galactic tyrant.The main characters are all great. All of them are memorable, fun, funny, and badass in their own way. I think everyone in the cast does a fine job. There is no one of the main characters I inherently disliked. The side cast was alright though we really do not spend time with them. This is mainly all about the Guardians which is fine.If there is a weak point in the cast and the movie itself it would be the villain. Ronan is really a nothing villain. He looks cool but that is all. He has no character or motivation other than to destroy the cosmos just because he is the bad guy. The way our heroes defeat him in the end is lame as well. This is why Thor is better for me. They are both fun movies but Thor had a better villain in Loki which made the film more enjoyable. Here it's just a cookie-cutter villain plot just like in Thor TDW. However, it didn't bother me quite as much there because this film was more fun. Thor was fun as well, but you had lame humor and some of the characters I did not care for this time around. Here the characters are all likable and the humor is more hit than miss so it isn't as much of an issue.The effects are great. Some people say it is like the Star Wars prequels in that regard but here you actually has characters you care about so it isn't a big deal. The soundtrack is also well put together. There are a lot of songs from the seventies played throughout the film. Sometimes it seemed like Zack Snyder was directing this. The songs were good, well integrated, and added to the tone and atmosphere that the film was building.Overall, Guardians of The Galaxy is a must see movie if you are a fan of the MCU so far or if you are just a fan of good Sci-Fi adventure stories like Star Wars or Star Trek. It definitely is modern day Star Wars. It seems like this will be a hit. It is nice to see previously unknown material (that's good) get the recognition it deserves. I'd like to see where they go from here with this material.",8,0,0,4 May 2019
Jurassic World," An Entertaining, But Unnecessary Nostalgia Trip
","Jurassic World is the fourth installment (you can say second considering it actively ignores the previous two sequels) in the Jurassic Park franchise which is one of my favorite franchises. I like all the installments for various reasons, film or literary, no matter how bad some can get. The first film is one of my favorite movies period. The Lost World, while inferior to the first film definitely, is still a worthy sequel and I feel is a very underrated film. I'm also a fan of the books by Michael Crichton of which the first two movies are based on. Jurassic Park 3, while certainly not a good movie like its predecessors, I can enjoy as an entertaining monster movie.I wasn't expecting too much going into this film. I knew it wouldn't be as good as the first film or even the second one. I was only expecting it to be an entertaining monster movie like the third film and that's exactly what got.The story is very simple. Twenty years after when the first film took place the park is officially opened (had been for years) and tourists are flocking to it by the truck loads. However, people had become desensitized and bored by regular dinosaurs so the owners and scientists in their infinite wisdom decided to create a genetically modified hybrid to up the wow factor. However, the hybrid escapes and starts wreaking havoc around the park and freeing other dinosaurs from their containers and everything goes awry.The film does have a few things going for it. It is quite entertaining as a straight forward monster movie and it did give me feelings of nostalgia. I like it mainly for the same reasons I like Jurassic Park 3 in that it's a fun monster movie.I also like that it tries to do something different with actually having the park up and running along with the incorporation of the dinosaur hybrid which is a cool monster with a nice design. Easily my favorite thing about this film is the Indominus Rex. It's a cool design, and it was enjoyable watching it work. The park itself also looks very nice and it was cool to actually see the park actually functioning.Chris Pratt also does a good job as the lead and I liked his character. I was worried from the trailers of him being a raptor whisperer. However, I think they handle it fairly well. It further establishes that these dinosaurs are not monsters (besides the new hybrid) but animals as the first two films made clear. I also like that they establish he's not in full control and the relationship has to be constantly tested. He's like a lion tamer.However, that's where the praise ends. Firstly, the CGI is horrible. It's been over twenty years since the first film yet the effects are easily the worst out of all the films. JP 3 had better effects than this. The effects for these films should be getting better not worse. The dinosaurs all look so incredibly fake it's not even funny. All the other films used animatronics along with the CG but this it's obviously 100% CG. If they did use animatronics then they definitely used CG over them.Also, the cast is subpar. Chris Pratt's character is good but he's the only one in my opinion. All the other character I was not invested in at all. Granted there was no character I adamantly disliked but no one I really cared for either besides Chris Pratt. The villain is also very one-note but, thankfully, he doesn't play a major role.Not to mention there are so many nods and even scenes reenacted from the first film it's ridiculous. I know this is the first film from this franchise in a long time and some nods are fine but there were so many of the same beats being hit it got a bit annoying. The final battle especially felt a lot like the final battle from Jurassic park with the raptors.Overall, Jurassic World is not a worthy sequel to the first two movies. I'd say it's on par with JP 3. In fact, I like JP 3 a bit more because of my nostalgia for it. However, if you're a fan of Jurassic Park then there's no reason not to see this.",5,0,1,11 January 2019
Elysium," All Style, But Little Substance
","Elysium is a decent movie, but it could have been much better. Elysium is directed by Neill Blomkamp, the same person who directed District 9. I personally thought that Elysium was a bit of a step down from District 9. It has great effects, good action, and a great main villain. However, the characters besides the villain I thought were a bit bland and the acting felt phoned in sometimes. Plus I did not find the film very enjoyable, at least until the final act.The effects for the film are great. The effects here are on par with District 9. The film has a very similar look to it as District 9, which is not surprising since it is the same director. I like all the technology employed here. The action scenes are good particularly the fight between Matt Damon's character and the villain played by Sharlto Copley. The score was decent as well.
The villain, Kruger, is a great villain. Sharlto Copley proves that he has great range as an actor. He seemed like one of the only characters that had any energy or passion. He is definitely the best part of the film.However, the film has many issues. The main characters, sad to say, were not very memorable. Matt Damon is okay in the role. However, the problem is that he is just okay. There is nothing that stands out in his performance, and there is no energy to it a lot of the time. I think that anybody could have played Damon's role. His character is more realistic and I did buy his plight, but I just did not find him very engaging. Alice Braga and the little girl were quite bland as well.Jody Foster plays the secondary villain of the movie. Foster does fin performance wise but I found her character very one-dimensional. She is not even a very fun villain like Copley is in this. William Fichtner is also in the film. However, he really has a nothing role and his character gets killed halfway through the film. He is basically just a plot device. Any actor could have that role.Another big issue I have with the film is the obvious message. This film tries to hammer home the message of 'don't pollute the environment.' It is a good but, like with Avatar, we have seen this message being conveyed in tons of other movies. I do not mind films having big messages, but I'd wish they would find a new way of telling it. I've seen the same message conveyed better in films like Wall-E, which is very similar to Elysium.On top of all that the film is not that enjoyable to watch, in my opinion. It is not a bad film. It is actually a pretty decent movie. However, it is not a film I would re-watch. I have the same problem with District 9. District 9 is a good movie, but it is not something I would watch again. I think it mostly has to do with the look of the look of both films. Both movies have a very bleak and dirty look to them. The world that is depicted in these two films is not very fun to look at. I understand that that was the point, but I still do not care for the look of these films. It is too depressing for my taste.Overall, Elysium is a decent film and is worth at least one viewing. I also think it is worth seeing in theatres if you have the chance, but I would see at matinee price.",5,1,3,25 November 2018
Avatar," All Style But Little Substance
","James Cameron's Avatar is probably one of the most overrated movies of the last decade. Avatar is the textbook definition of style over substance. The film is cool visuals and decent action and that is all. The film has no interesting characters, the villains are all comical stereotypes with no dimension at all, and it is predictable from beginning to end. The plot of this film has been done to death in tons of other films, so there are no surprises. This film does not deserve to be the highest grossing film ever. Plus the film is way too long. Many scenes could have been cut and it would have been the same movie.The biggest problem is the plot, which is extremely predictable. From the first ten minutes I could guess how the film would play out and I was right. The plot is basically the plot of Dances with Wolves but with aliens instead of Native Americans. You have a soldier who is hired to drive the natives off the land. However, as the film goes on he befriends the natives and learns of their culture. Eventually he joins the natives and fights his own people. I would not be so upset if they just took a few elements from Dances with Wolves. However, Avatar is Dances with Wolves, just with aliens. There is almost no difference at all.What's worse is that the characters are really lame. Sam Worthington's character is generic and not interesting at all. Sam Worthington does not do a horrible job performance wise, but half of the time he looks like he is ready for lunch. His character is the stereotypical good guy and the fish-out-of-water. He is also kind of an idiot. For example, that scene when he first is transferred into the avatar body and has legs is cringe-worthy and goes on for too long. He just behaves like a little kid that got his new toy. The supporting characters are boring as well. Many of them are just devices used to move the plot along like Michelle Rodriguez's character. Sigourney Weaver is in this too. She does fine but she cannot save the cast.The villains are even worse. They are unbelievable stereotypical and one-dimensional. One of the villains played by Giovanni Ribisi is just the stereotypical rich guy who only cares about money. The other big villain played by Stephen Lang is the over-the-top one-dimensional general who wants to destroy the Navi civilization for no other reason than he is the bad guy of the movie. These seem more like Captain Planet villains than ones you would see in a supposedly adult film like this.It is a shame because James Cameron used to know how to write good characters. He wrote Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Hudson from Aliens. He also created iconic characters like Sarah Connor and John Connor from Terminator. Cameron could also write good villains like the T-1000 from Terminator 2 or Burk from Aliens. Now he seems to care more for the effects and the spectacle of a movie rather than the story and character. With both this and Titanic before Cameron has given us oversimplified characters that are mostly there for forced drama and/or to drive home a message that you see on countless after school specials. He had fifteen years to work on Avatar, so there is no excuse for a predictable story and bland characters like what we have here. He obviously cared more about making the effects look amazing (which they do) and the story and characters were just an afterthought.There are good things about the film. The effects look amazing. Pandora is very colorful, unique, and pleasing to the eye. I have not seen it in 3D, but I heard that it was pretty good. The acting is fine except from Sam Worthington. It also has some decent action, particularly at the end with the final battle. The film has some entertaining parts like some parts at the beginning and the final fight. Many people who defend this movie say that it is more about the experience of being on Pandora.Yes, it is a good experience in the theater, but that does not mean that the film is good. A film needs more than spectacle to be good. There are lots of films where I had a good experience watching the film in theaters, but as I thought about it more and watched it again at home I find that the film is not that good. X-Men Origins Wolverine is a film that quickly comes to mind. I did not even have that great of an experience watching it in the theater actually. It was fun to look at, but the story and characters were too bland for me, and I was just bored. I found this to be a very boring movie.Overall, if you want to sit through two hours and forty minutes of eye candy then by all means see the film, although most people have seen the film by now. I personally, found Avatar to be an extremely long, predictable, simplistic, boring movie.",5,1,1,4 May 2019
Super 8," Gave me Feelings of Nostalgia
","Super 8 gives me feelings of the nostalgia. When I watch this film, I'm reminded of when I was a kid watching the Goonies. Super 8 was obviously J.J. Abrams' omage to films like the Goonies. Personally, I think he did a good job. I liked this film just as much as the Goonies. The characters were mostly likable and funny (mainly the kids). The plot is interesting. There is this feeling of mystery and adventure, like the Goonies had. There were some minor problems. Many of the adult characters I did not care for. The design of the alien was not that great. Plus there was one thing that happened in the movie that made absolutely no sense. Overall, anyone who's a fan of the Goonies or Scifi films, check this out!",8,1,2,26 April 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Nice Follow-Up To The First Film
","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the long awaited sequel to the surprise hit Guardians of the Galaxy. No one thought that film would be good, or be a success, but it was. Is this film good too, or did it crumble under the immense pressure. In all honesty, this film is actually a little better than the first. There's one simple reason for that; the characters and their amazing interactions and development.Practically everything that made the first film fun and appealing is in this film; the action, the effects, the spectacle, the adventure, the humor, the music, the great characters, everything. The one thing this film does differently is the story. The first movie had a very straight forward narrative that you knew where it was taking you.In this film you don't know where the plot is going until the third act. Some might have an issue with this, but I actually didn't mind it. With the first film you knew exactly how it was going to play out in terms of the plot. Here it could've gone in any direction, which makes it a bit more fun to watch.What truly makes this film better to me is the character development. The first movie basically just set-up the characters, their personalities, and motivations, but focused more on the story. In this the story takes a back seat to the characters and their development and interactions. This is fine, because the characters are more important than story. The story is important, but the characters are why you care.The character who gets the most development is star Lord, but everyone gets their development and chance to shine. Gamora, Rocket, Nebula, even Yondu all get great development. The only two major characters who lack development in this movie are Drax and Groot. Though, to be fair, there isn't much more that can be done with them, especially Drax.The new characters are also good. Kurt Russell as star Lord's father is really good. Silvester Stallone also has a cameo in this, which was cool. The villain is another improvement over the first film. He's not an amazing villain, but he's made automatically better by the fact that he has a more personal connection with our heroes.The one issue I had was some of the humor. The first film had good humor. I'm not saying this one did not, but there was an overabundance of it. Many sequels to films praised for their good humor will add more humor, which is usually detrimental to the movie, like Transformers 2 or Sherlock Holmes 2. This film does have that, especially in the first half. There many jokes that hit, but many that don't as well, especially Drax's humor. Drax I actually find to be the week point of this movie. Not only is he not given any real development, but most of his jokes I found lame.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun time, especially if you enjoyed the first movie. Everything you love about that film is in this one, and then some. The comedy is hit or miss, but that's just me. Comedy is subjective.",7,0,0,4 May 2019
Thor," Very Underrated MCU Film.
","Thor is the fourth superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. People are somewhat mixed on the film. Some love it, while others do not care for it. I personally really enjoyed this film. I thought Chris Hemsworth was the perfect choice to play for like Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Iron Man. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant like always. Natalie Portman also gives a great performance. The villain is a very cunning and very sympathetic villain. The effects are amazing and the action scenes are awesome.The story is quite simple. Long ago Asghard, led by Odin (Anthony Hopkins) fought an enemy known as the Frost Giants. Asghard won the war. Years later Frost Giants invade Asghard but are thwarted by Odin. Our hero Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his friends including his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) invade the Frost Giant homeland and pretty much start another war. For his actions Odin banishes Thor to Earth in order to become a more mature person. There he meets a girl named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her family and because of them gradually grows as a person. Then the main villain Loki sends forces to Earth to kill Thor he needs to regain his powers and defeat him.The story is basically a coming of age story. The story is generic, but sometimes generic works. I for one got invested into the Thor character and enjoyed following him on his journey. The character of Thor is very arrogant and quick to anger in the beginning but not to the point where you do not like him. As the film goes on he becomes more mature and humble and you really believe it.Natalie Portman does a good job here as well. Natalie Portman, in the last five years has truly proved herself as a great actress. She was given a bad name for the longest thanks to the Star Wars prequels. She was pretty bad in those movies, but that was more George Lucas's direction than anything. People say that the stuff on Earth was fairly boring, but it was necessary. The stuff on Earth is there to make Thor grow as a character. Natalie's character was definitely necessary in that. I do agree, however, that the scenes on Earth could have been a bit shorter.The villain Loki is also great. Of all the villains in these Marvel movies in this universe, I think that Loki is the best one, at least in this movie. He is made into more of a generic bad guy in the Avengers, but here you really buy his motivations. You find out that he is actually the son of Asghard's enemy. Plus, Odin always held Thor in higher regard than him and he wanted to prove himself. You do not condone what he does but you see where he is coming from.The effects of this film are great. Though I don't mind the Earth scenes for the most part, I just love when they are in Asghard or in the Frost Giant realm. The CGI is simple beautiful. The action scenes are also great particularly the one where Thor and his friends fight the Frost Giants in their realm in the beginning of the film. I did not see the film in 3D so I cannot comment on that.Overall, Thor is a good coming of age story. Before this movie came out I would have never thought that Thor could work in live action. However, this film and the Avengers definitely proved me wrong. If you are a fan of the Thor comics or are just a fan of the MCU them definitely check this out.",8,2,2,11 November 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog Day With Aliens. I'm sold!
","Edge of Tomorrow was a pleasant surprise for me going in. Of the big blockbuster movies coming out in the summer of 2014, Edge of Tomorrow was one of the ones I was looking forward to least, but I ended up really liking it. In fact, it is probably one of the better movies of the summer so far. They took an unoriginal premise and actually made it work. Tom Cruise does a great job. The action and effects were also very well-done.The story revolves around a man named William Cage (Tom Cruise) who is a Major in the American army. However, he is mostly a public speaker and is not used to combat. He is suddenly forced into this huge battle with an alien race which up until now have been unmatched by any military in the world. This was supposed be the deciding battle for the humans but it goes horribly. However, when Cage kills an alpha alien and dies he gains their ability. Now whenever he dies he repeats the same day before the big battle over and over again until he is able to destroy the aliens' power source. To do this he must get the help of a soldier named Rita (Emily Blunt).The film does many things amazingly. I like the way they handle rinse and repeat type of story. I have seen this many times so I was not expecting too much going in, but I thought it was handled well. I love how Cage is able to take everything he has experienced from his countless repeats and use it to his advantage, whether it comes to his combat skills, to him relating and reasoning with the rest of the cast. The film is also very funny in how Cage repeats everything. I love how he gets wasted countless times in battle or by Rita herself. I especially love the training sequence where he constantly gets seriously injured and Rita kills him and he has to start over. This film really does feel like a video game where when you die you start the mission again, except I am watching instead of playing.Tom Cruise does a great job in this. His character is the driving factor in this film. If not for him I would not like this film nearly as much as I do. I like how he starts out as a wimp in the beginning (which I am not used to seeing) and steadily grows more and more badass as the film progressed. Cruise has done many Sci-Fi films in the last few years like Oblivion. I like Oblivion a bit more than this, but this is still well-done. I also love Bill Paxton in this. I like his character and his performance is great. I have not seen Paxton in a major film in years so it was great to see him back.As I said before the action and special effects look nice. The design for the aliens is something I have not quite seen before. I also like their ability that they gave to Cage. I have seen better looking aliens but I think they look fine.I do have a couple issues though. Other than Cruise and Paxton's characters I did not find the rest of the cast to be that memorable. Rita is okay and Emily Blunt does a good job performance-wise. However, despite having some cool moments, I was just was not that invested in her. When her and Cage are having their romantic and dramatic moments I did not care. The other important characters are the people in Paxton's platoon. I do not remember any of these people. At first I thought this was going to be like Aliens where you have a group of very like able and badass marines, but that is not the case. They are boring and ultimately pretty irrelevant.Overall, Edge of Tomorrow is an entertaining Sci-Fi movie that takes a premise we have seen many times and puts a relatively new spin on it. I think you should definitely check it out. Unfortunately, like with Oblivion, it seems that the film is not doing very well in the US which is a shame.",8,0,1,25 November 2018
Kong: Skull Island," A Very Fun Ride
","Kong Skull Island is a summer blockbuster at its finest. It's a great looking spectacle with fun action, and an all-around entertaining flick. There isn't much to it beyond that, but it's not trying to be anything more either. For what the film is it works fine, though could have been improved in some areas. I was cautiously optimistic about seeing this film as it's supposed to be in the same universe as Godzilla 2014, which was one of the biggest letdowns in recent memory, in my opinion. Also, I am not a big fan of Peter Jackson's King Kong. It's good, but not really my cup of tea. It was a great looking film with some good action, but it was far too long, and got really boring in places for me. Thankfully, this film definitely more entertaining than Godzilla or King Kong (2005), but does have some of the same issues as the former.The story is very simple. A new island is discovered via satellite and is dubbed Skull Island. A team is sent to the island to study the geography and wildlife. They then get attacked by King Kong, as well as other giant creatures that call the island home. Now our main characters must survive and find a way to get off the island.What this film definitely has going for it is the spectacle. The film looks great, from the cinematography to the score, to the special effects. Unlike Godzilla 2014, which only showed Godzilla full-on for maybe two scenes that only last a few seconds, this film shows us Kong in his full glory very early on and we do see quite a bit of him throughout the movie. Though, I wish we could've seen him more. Also unlike Godzilla 2014 where all the Godzilla action is in the background, when we see Kong in action it's in the forefront and it is very pleasing to watch. All of the action was well-done I thought. If you want to see giant monster action like I did you will get your money's worth. If nothing else, this is an entertaining movie.The movie has good pacing too. It wastes almost no time in getting to what the audience came to see the movie for.The characters aren't the strongest. This was one of the things that killed the Godzilla movie for me. Not only was there barely any Godzilla in favor of the humans, but the characters were some of the blandest I've ever seen. A block of wood is less bland than they were.I think the main issue in this film is that there are too many characters, and many of them get lost in the shuffle. Some characters you forget are even in the film like John Goodman's. Though, the cast here is better than Godzilla because of the actors. Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, John C. Reilly, and John Goodman all do a good job performance-wise, though the script lets them down a little. Samuel L. Jackson's character goes through an arc in this film that I did not entirely like and the film could've done without.The characters here are definitely more fun here than Godzilla, despite my issues with them. I was with them enough where I wasn't bored with the movie, which is something. The movie does attempt to be more fun, unlike Godzilla which was entirely joyless. However, while some of the jokes land others fall flat. Some of the humor comes off as quite awkward and conflicts with the tone of the film.Overall, Kong Skull Island was a fun experience. If you're looking for a fun monster movie you should have a good time. If you want anything more you might be disappointed. It has great monster action and is a beautiful looking film. The human characters aren't the most interesting, but are still pretty fun to watch. It certainly did not kill the movie for me like it did Godzilla.",8,1,2,10 February 2019
Arrival," Nice Original Alien Invasion Film
","Arrival is basically a combination of Contact and Signs. It has the atmosphere and feel of Signs and the story of Contact. Though, I think it ends up being better than both those films. This is mainly due to the ending. Both Contact and Signs started out really interesting and engaging, but then started to lose it by the third act, and then the ending ruins it. With Signs the ending was just lame; with Contact the ending was both lame and confusing. With the amount of build-up this film gives us in the first and second acts the ending could have been a complete letdown just like those films were. Thankfully, this film does not drop the ball on the ending, which makes Arrival a cut above the rest. Despite that I would not call Arrival a phenomenon like most praise as. It's definitely a good movie, but I was not blown away by it.Like I said earlier, the story is very similar to contact where humanity finally has contact with alien visitors and the main character Louise, played by Amy Adams, is trying to find a way to decipher their language and communicate back to them. The differences that, unlike Contact where the characters are deciphering a message and we never actually see the aliens, here the extraterrestrials actually come to Earth and the humans communicate with them directly, which makes the film more visually interesting.The film also has a very gloomy atmosphere to it, very much like Signs or a Christopher Nolan film. If I did not know the director and people said Nolan directed this movie I would believe it, especially with the ending, which is something he would concoct.The movie looks great in spite of the gloomy atmosphere. The effects team did an amazing job with the visuals. The score, while not the most memorable, also did its job at setting the mood of the scene.The main thing about this film that prevents it from being a masterpiece for me is the characters. Amy Adams is fine but the rest of the cast I thought was lacking. The one thing Signs does better than this film and Contact, in my opinion, is the characters. I was invested in Mel Gibson and his family more than the cast in Arrival and Contact. You got good actors like Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, but their characters were rather bland. Jeremy Renner's character felt rather pointless in the film until the very end when his role becomes clear. Even so, the film does not make him a compelling character and his chemistry with Amy Adams felt a little forced.Plus, while you understand their importance by the end, there are many scenes that drag and drag down the pacing a little. Also, while the ending is good, there are a few scenes that feel odd or didn't really make sense with what the ending was going for, which I won't reveal to avoid spoilers. That's more of a nitpick, but it bugs me.Overall, if you enjoyed Signs and/or Contact, or even aspects of those films you'll like Arrival. If you like Interstellar, Inception, or just about anything directed by Christopher Nolan you'll enjoy Arrival. I'd say it's definitely one of, if not the best alien invasion film to come out in a long time. I didn't think it was spectacular like most did, but it's definitely solid.",8,1,1,16 January 2020
Wonder Woman," The First Good DCEU Movie
","Wonder Woman is the newest entry in the DCEU line-up. Amazingly, it's the first truly great film in this universe; I'm surprised and delighted to say. Man of steel I like, but it has its glaring faults, especially in the third act. BVS has its moments but it is a bad film overall. Suicide Squad is just horrible. It was one of the worst movie theater experiences I've had. Thankfully, this film is legitimately good. It not only has great action, but also a plot that makes coherent sense, characters with personality I actually like, and heart. Wonder Woman is basically a mix of Richard Donner's Superman and Captain America the First Avenger. Like Superman, the film is an epic that covers the highlights of Diana's (Wonder Woman) life on her isolated island of amazons, up until becoming a superhero. The film is also a period piece, taking place primarily in a war-torn setting, like Captain America. This time, it's World War I instead of WWII. When Steve Trevor, the first man to set foot on the island, crash lands there he tells Diana about the war outside in the world of man. Diana decides to go with him to destroy Ares, the God of War and stop the war. The rest of the film is basically that, with some character expansion and growth in between. I cannot think of a major fault with this film. It delivered in every way it was supposed to. One minor complaint is that the battles, especially early on, were very slow-motion heavy. Slow-motion has been milked to death since the Matrix, and I'm getting sick of it. It's not a huge issue, but it bothered me a bit. The villains are not the strongest either, which has been a trend in superhero films lately. Other than that the action was on-point, as was the effects, cinematography, and music. Wonder Woman's them in particular was amazing. I think it's one of the best superhero themes to date, up there with Superman's and Iron Man's. The acting is on-point in the film as well from everyone in the cast. I've always been a fan of Chris Pine. He did fine in the new Star Trek films and he was great in Unstoppable, which is underrated. I will say this is probably his best performance yet. Gal Gadot ultimately does a good job as Wonder Woman. I found her a bit wooden in BVS. She was still a bit wooden in the beginning of this film as well, which had me somewhat worried. However, as the film progresses, she does come into the role and gives a worthwhile performance. What this film truly has in its favor is that it has heart, which has been sorely lacking in the DCEU movies. What makes the majority of MCU movies loved my many is that they have heart to them. The characters feel like people rather than plot devices like in BVS or Suicide Squad. While the majority of the film had a rather downbeat tone, it had an upbeat message and feel, which the other DCEU movies up until now didn't really have. Overall, Wonder Woman is certainly a step in the right direction for the DCEU. Let's just hope Justice League doesn't screw it up. As a fan of the character I'm glad to finally have her adapted on the big screen, and done well.",9,5,13,14 June 2017
Black Panther," Good, Though A Tad Overrated
","Black Panther is the latest MCU movie. After he appeared in Civil War, there was much hype for Black Panther getting his own solo film. After seeing it I think this is the best MCU movie since Civil War. Is it the best MCU movie? No. I feel like every time one of these comes out now everyone praises it as the best in the MCU. Critics said that about Thor Ragnarok when that came out. I liked that film, but really it was an okay film at best. Black Panther is definitely better than Ragnarok. I'd it's actually a genuinely good movie, but not without its faults.The general cliff notes plot is as follows. With his father dead, T'Challa/the Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is now the king of his home country of Wakanda, the most advanced, and secluded, nation on Earth. However, our main villain Killmonger challenges the new king's reign and attempt to use Wakanda's advanced technology to dominate the world.First I'll delve into the positives. Firstly, I really like the Black Panther as a character. I was already impressed with him in Civil War, but I wanted to hold off judgement until he got his own movie. Now I can say Black Panther is my second favorite MCU character behind Captain America. The side characters were pretty decent too.The film has great cinematography as well. The majority of the film takes place in Africa/Wakanda and it looks fantastic. Not only that, but the film does a fairly good job delving into the culture of Wakanda and its inner workings, backstory, and political stances and issues.Most of the action was good and shot very well, with a couple exceptions, which I'll get into. I also like the style this film has, from its opening and closing aminations, to its score, to even way of using text and credits. You'll know what I mean when you see the film.Killmonger, in my opinion, is one of the better MCU villains, up there with Loki and Zemo. His goal is rather basic, but his motivations are understandable to where you can sympathize with him to a degree. Michael B. Jordan does a great job in the performance as well.The film is not perfect though, as I've stated. The movie has the same issues the Thor movies do. The scenes in Wakanda are great, but the scenes in our society, while not bad, don't measure up in comparison. While most of the action was good there were a couple underwhelming scenes. The opening action in particular was shot too dark and filmed with much shaky cam that it was hard to enjoy. The final fight between Black Panther and Killmonger was also too short and underwhelming.Lastly, the minor villain played by Andy Serkis I did not care for at all. Andy Serkis is a great actor, but this was definitely not one of his best performances. I don't blame Serkis, but more the lines and direction he was given.Overall, Black Panther is a very solid entry in the MCU. Is it the best like so many say it is? No. Is it revolutionary, like many claims? No. Nevertheless, it's still a good movie that's worth seeing if you're a fan of the MCU or just comic book or action movies in general.",8,5,9,25 November 2018
Blade Runner," Not just one of my favorite science fiction films, but one of my favorite films period.
","Blade Runner is a sci-fi masterpiece. It has almost everything in a good sci-fi flick; breathtaking effects, a deep and philosophical story, good characters, amazing atmosphere, and a great cast. Harrison Ford brings his A-game with this one. This is probably one of my favorite performances of his. In my opinion this is Ridley Scott's best film, and one of my favorite movies period. Admittedly, when I first saw this movie I hated it. I gave the film another chance though and I grew to love it. The reason I didn't like it at first was because I wasn't in the right mindset for it. I was expecting a film like Star Wars which this is definitely not. You really have to be in the right mindset to view this. Blade Runner is not the movie you just pop in for a casual viewing to kill time or if you want to have a fun time. It's dark, atmospheric, philosophical, and has a downbeat tone throughout. This is most likely why Blade Runner didn't do well in theaters. This film came out the same year as E.T. Everyone wanted fun sci-fi which this film clearly isn't. Fortunately, over the years, it has become a cult classic, which it deserves to be.The film takes place in Las Angeles in the dystopian future of 2019. We follow a retired cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is called back to the force temporarily. Several human-like androids called replicants have gone rogue and it is Deckard's job to bring them down.As I said, the film looks brilliant. I think the special effects are on-par with the Star Wars trilogy. Yes, it's not the most colorful looking film or very fun to look at, but that's the point. The film is going for a very realistic dystopian future with overpopulation, pollution, and very cultural. The acting is great particularly from Ford. The only characters worth mentioning are Deckard or the main replicants, Batty (Rutger Hauer). The story is told from their different perspectives. From following both of them we see both of their views on what it means to be human which is one of the main themes of the movie.There are things that can be seen as flaws with the film. When I first saw the movie there were many things I didn't like about it until I tried to see things differently. Firstly, the film moves at a fairly slow pace or, at least, it felt that way. This is a trait you see in most Ridley Scott films. The atmosphere and overall feel of the film is a little too good if that makes sense. If you are the slightest bit sleepy this film can easily put you to sleep. I just about fell asleep on my first viewing. I'd watch the director's cut or the final cut of the film if possible. In the theatrical cut you have Harrison Ford give narrations throughout the movie, and it just made the film even more of a snore fest. The film is trying to build atmosphere and enthrall you into the world it's created, but some people will probably have issue with it. It's not bad but I do think people will think the film is too padded-out.Another thing is the action scenes. The action in this film is not like Star Wars or Indiana Jones. Deckard is actually not a very good fighter. He gets his butt handed to him quite frequently by the replicants. This did really bother me on first viewing. However, I don't feel that way now. I think that the way they did the actions scenes made them feel more real. Besides, if they were to have Star Wars or Indiana Jones type action in this then it would conflict with the tone of the rest of the film.Overall, Blade Runner is a classic movie that should be seen at least once. Just go in with the mindset that this is not like Star Wars, Total Recall, E.T., War of The Worlds, or any of those sci-fi films and you'll be fine. It's sad that it didn't get much recognition when it was first released, but at least it is getting the treatment it deserves now.",10,2,3,8 October 2017
Thor: The Dark World," Not as Good as the First, but still Entertaining.
","Thor The Dark World is a very action-packed, visually pleasing, and entertaining time at the movies. I ultimately really enjoyed the movie. However, the film does have some notable issues. In some ways Thor 2 is superior to the first film, but in most it is inferior. The film takes place sometime after the Avengers. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has been locked up in the prison in Asghard for what he did in New York. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and everyone else are fighting to restore peace to the nine realms. Meanwhile the villain named Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his race called the Dark Elves have returned from their slumber. Their goal is to obtain a substance called Ether to destroy the nine realms and return everything to darkness. Meanwhile, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her friends come across a dimensional anomaly. This is happening because all nine realms are lining up which happens every-so-often. Because of this she is transported to Asghard and back and is infected with Ether. Thor must now save Jane and all nine realms from the Dark Elves with the help of Loki. The film has many great qualities. The effects are amazing. The effects in the first film were already great, but this film ups the ante. The effects are twice or even three times better than the first film, as is the world building. This film showcases more of the nine realms, and also fleshes out Asghard better than the last film did. The film spends more time in Asghard and in the Dark Elves' home world than on Earth which I was okay with. I did not dislike the time spent on Earth like many people did, but I just found the scenes on Asghard and the Ice Realm to be more interesting and fun. Lastly the action scenes are greatly entertaining, especially the Loki prison break scene. The action is another thing that is upped in this film. I also love the design of the Dark Elves. I also like the technology employed by both the Dark Elves and Asghard. This film does a better job at showcasing the technology and mythology of these different realms.However, where this film excelled in action and effects, it unfortunately drops the ball when it comes to character. There is really no character development in this show. Thor is now a wise leader that puts other first. Other than having to defeat the bad guy there is no conflict he has to deal with, and he does not change or grow. Granted, I would rather have a character remain static than regress and forget the lessons they learn from the previous film like in the Iron Man sequels. However, I would like some form of development for the characters, especially the main ones, but we really do not get that. Thor, as well as the other main characters are still likable and they never irritated me, but I felt that their characters never went anywhere. Odin and Thor's friends in Asghard are given even less to do than in the first film which is saying something. Those characters did not get much to do in the first film, but I can kind of understand because the film is about Thor learning his lesson and about Loki's jealousy. However, here they are given less to do which is a big missed opportunity. I heard a lot was cut from this film, which might include more of Odin, Thor's friends, and the villain, which the film needed. I hope we get to see that footage when the film comes to DVD. The villain is extremely boring and lazy as well. He is probably the weakest kink in this film. He is a generic villain that wants to destroy the world and the hero must stop him. He has no dimension or charm like Loki does. Compared to Loki in the first film and the Avengers this villain is weak. Even in this film Loki is better, because you constantly question whether you can trust him. Also, they threw in this very forced humor that does not work. This mainly occurs when we are on Earth. When we are on Asghard and the other realms the humor they had felt natural and was funny. Occasionally you get a funny joke, but whenever we are on Earth we are treated to unfunny humor. We had quite a bit of humor on Earth in the first Thor but, in my opinion, it was not as forced and was actually funny. I feel that this becoming a thing with these Marvel movies, where they feel the need to through in forced and unnecessary humor. The Iron Man sequels definitely have this problem.Overall, Thor The Dark World is a very entertaining film. There is not much dimension past the action and scope, but the characters are still likable and fun and the action and effects are breathtaking. It is not quite as good as the first film, but is a good movie nonetheless. I think it is definitely worth a viewing in the theater.",7,1,1,11 November 2017
The Sixth Sense," One of Shyamalan's Best But A Tad Overrated
","Sixth Sense is a good film, but I find it very overrated. Everyone and their mother praises this film as being not only one of M. Night Shyamalan's best films but one of the best thrillers period. On the cover it of the DVD it even says; 'The Best Thriller Ever!' No. When I finally saw the film many years ago I was quite underwhelmed. I found it to be a decent suspense/horror film. The acting was fine. Bruce Willis does a good job in the film. However, I do not see it as the masterpiece that everyone thinks it is. I recently re-watched the film without any of those expectations, and I liked the film even more. I do think this a really good movie, and one of Shyamalan's best. However, I still don't think it's Shyamalan's peak. In my opinion, his greatest film is Unbreakable, which deserves more recognition.Bruce Willis plays a child psychologist named Dr. Malcolm Crowe. Crowe meets a Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment. Cole claims to be able to see dead people wherever he goes.Another preconceived notion I had when I first viewed the film years and years ago was that I thought it was a horror film, because I had heard that so many people found the film incredibly scary. I saw the film under that notion and didn't find it scary in the least. But this not a horror film at all. It's simply a psychological thriller with supernatural elements. We don't even see any supernatural things happen until more than an hour in. At first you think it's all in the kid's mind.Bruce Willis and Haley do a fine job acting wise. I did like these two characters. I thought they were both likable and had energy, which is more than I can say for the character in Shyamalan's latest works. The story was and how the final twist is handled is some Shyamalan's best writing. I often forget how talented of s story and character writer Shyamalan could be given some of his later work. It's like in between Signs and Split all of his writing talent was just sucked out of him by some unknown force, and he somehow got it back.Overall I liked the Sixth Sense, but I do not think it is as good a people make it out to be. It is a film that should be seen at least once though.",8,0,1,29 January 2019
Godzilla," Overrated!
","Godzilla 2014 is a big disappointment for me. The film is a decent movie but, in my opinion, not a good Godzilla movie and just a lackluster film in general. There is barely any Godzilla in the film and instead focuses mostly on the human point-of-view. That is not necessarily a bad approach except that the human characters are not that interesting. When we see Godzilla and the other monsters wreak havoc it is awesome and there is some good action and great effects. However, when we finally see Godzilla wreak havoc and fighting the other creatures it is short-lived until the very end. Plus, the film is very padded out.The film is not god-awful. There are a lot of things that the film does very well. The effects are amazing. This is probably the best looking Godzilla movie so far. The movie, especially at the end fight has a very grand and epic feel to it. Everything just feels so huge and when the action scenes happen they are epic from the great effects, to the action, to the great set pieces. This must be an amazing film to see in 3D. I did not see it in 3D though.I also really like the design of Godzilla as well as the other monsters. Of all the films I have seen I think this one has my favorite design of Godzilla. Fans of the original Godzilla from Japan will be happy to know that this film stays true to the original film and lore right down to Godzilla's look. A good chunk of the film also takes place in Japan. For me personally, I do not care about that as much.Unlike most people I was introduced to Godzilla through the 1998 film and grew up on that, so I will always like and look to that movie first. I know I am in the minority but I enjoy the 1998 Godzilla movie. Honestly, I even like that film more than this film. I am not asking for anyone to agree but that's how I feel. I like the characters more, I like the action scenes more (though they did not feel as epic), and I like that Godzilla was used much more. The film felt a lot more like a Godzilla movie because he was in it much more and felt like a more realized character. I actually felt for Godzilla in the 1998 film, while in this one it was hard to get invested in Godzilla because we do not see him enough.One of the big issues I have with the film is that we barely see any Godzilla. The most we see of him is his spikes sticking out of the water. We do not see Godzilla in his full glory until near the end. We see the other monsters more and even then not much. When Godzilla or the other creatures wreck a city when he is fighting the other creatures we only see a little bit of it then it cuts away and then you see the end result until the end fight, which bugged me. When we see the monsters wreaking havoc it looks amazing, so I wish I could have seen more of it. When the trailers hinted that other monsters besides Godzilla would be in the film I was expecting something along the lines of Pacific Rim with lots of monster action, but that is not what we get. I do not want to hear people say: 'A movie with lots of monster action is not realistic.' This is a movie that has giant monsters. What is realistic about that? What I like about the 1998 film is that they have fun with the monster.The entire film is from the perspective of the humans which is not always bad but it is in this case. The human characters are not interesting enough to keep me invested for the entire film. The characters in the 1998 film, whether you like them or not, have more personality and are more memorable than the people in this. The only interesting character in the film is Brian Cranston's character. When he was there I was more invested and I thought he was going to be the lead considering he was marketed as the main character in the trailers. However he is killed off halfway through the film and the lead role shifts to his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and there is nothing to this guy. He is not interesting and has only one expression on his face throughout the entire film. He just looks very bored even when everything is coming down around him. The other characters are extremely forgettable, if you can even call them characters. The only other somewhat decent character is Dr. Ishiro played by Ken Watanabe. However, most of his screen time consists of him standing around not doing anything so it does not matter.Overall, Godzilla 2014 is sadly an underwhelming movie in my opinion. It can be considered a good or even great movie to fans of the original Godzilla. For me it was a disappointment. There are things the film does well or even amazingly well. I guess I was expecting a somewhat different film then what we got. You don't have to think that way though. I think many people will enjoy the film. Many people who have seen it did enjoy it.",5,2,3,10 February 2019
Deadpool," Everything Deadpool Should Be
","Deadpool might be the most original and innovative comic book movie yet. Not innovative in terms of the story or most of the characters, but in the execution and the title character, Deadpool. Now, I was not very familiar with Deadpool before this film. I first learned of the character's existence when playing the video game, Marvel Ultimate Alliance. Ever since, I've seen the character hyped-up like mad in the geek community, which surprised me considering I didn't even know of the character until recently at that time.The first attempted to bring this character to the big screen was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which did not go over well to say the least. They didn't seem to get the character at all. I didn't even know much about Deadpool then, but I knew enough to know they dropped the ball in portraying him. This film feels very much like an apology for that train wreck.Well, apology accepted! Deadpool was an extremely fun and exciting film. On the surface it seems like another superhero/revenge movie like The Punisher, Dirty Harry, Deathwish, and so on, but that's not the case.It sounds incredibly formulaic on paper but it all comes down to execution, which this film does right. It doesn't take itself that seriously. This film is as much a comedy as it is a superhero/revenge flick. In fact, it's more of a comedy. I think it's great how this film can poke fun at all the clichÃ©s of these kinds of films and, at the same time, embrace them. This movie reminds me of the anime One Punch Man in that regard, and it works for many of the same reasons.This time around, the studio truly nailed what the character, Deadpool, is from the costume to his dark sense of humor. There is no doubt we're going to much more of Deadpool in movies in the future which I'm fine with. It's great that Marvel isn't the only studio that is taking more obscure characters and making them mainstream. I might have to read some Deadpool comics now.The production values are great as well. The action is top notch, the violence is on point, the effects are great, and it's competently shot. They even got two X-Men in the film which I did not see coming. But they turned out to be welcome additions that brought some good humor and action scenes. These X-Men look more comic book-esc than the X-Men in any of the X-Men movies thus far. In fact, this might be 20th Century Fox's first comic book film that is the closest to being a comic book yet. The closest being the first two (official) Fantastic Four movies.The film has a couple minor issues for me. There's quite a lot of raunchy humor in the film which I didn't care for. While I know it's a part of Deadpool's character, I'm not the biggest fan of that type of humor. I think it's the lowest form of humor, second only to fart humor. But, fortunately, there were plenty of other jokes to offset it. Most of the other jokes hit, particularly the fourth wall jokes.Overall, Deadpool is definitely the film the character deserved. The film is not for everyone. If you're squeamish or don't like raunchy humor this is probably not for you. If you know what you're getting into you should enjoy yourself.",8,0,1,4 May 2019
Fast Five," The Best Fast and Furious Film
","Fast Five is without a doubt the best film is the Fast franchise. I enjoyed the Fast and The Furious as a popcorn film. I did not care for either 2 Fast 2 Furious or Tokyo Drift. I thought Fast and Furious was a step up from the previous films. However, Fast Five is on a whole other level. I enjoy Furious 6 the most, but Fast Five is a better film.The characters are the best aspect about the film. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker reprise their roles here. I think they turn their best performances here. Jordana Brewster returns as Mia. She does a good job with what she is given. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) gives his best performance in a long time in this movie. To me this is the Rock's return to action movies not Faster.
All the other cast members from the previous films return here. Tyrese Gibson comes back as Roman Pierce. I did not care for Gibson in 2 Fast 2 Furious, but I do not mind him here as much. This is probably because he is a supporting character in this film, and not a main character that has to carry the film. Ludacris (Tej) and Sung Kang (Han) return as well. I never cared about those characters but they did fine in this movie. Gisele, played by Gal Gadot comes back too. She had a small role in Fast and Furious that is not even worth noting. However, I thought her character was awesome here. The character of Vincent is back from the first movie as well. I did not like his character at all in Fast and the Furious, and I did not care for him here either. He is one of the only characters that I did not like in this film. I loved seeing the cast of all the Fast films together. The interacting they all have with each other is great and very fun.The villain, I will say is weak. That should not be a surprise at this point. The Fast films have always had weak villains. Though, I will, say, this villain is one of the stronger villains of the franchise, though that is not saying that much.The action is top-notch! The action scenes trump anything in the other Fast films before it. The action is different than the other films too. It focuses less on races (though there are some) and more on fist fight, fire fights, car chases, etc. This film is more of a heist movie than a racing movie. The effects for the film are also top of the line, and better than all of the other movies. The ending scene alone is worth seeing the movie for.Overall this is a must watch for all who are fans of this franchise. This is easily the best Fast film in almost every category whether it is characters, story, action, effects, etc. It's not Oscar material, but, as far as action films go, it's one of the best of the past decade; maybe two.",8,1,1,17 August 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Somehow Surpasses The Original
","John Wick Chapter 2 is the sequel to the surprising hit action movie John Wick. Most sequels are inferior, but this was one of the few sequels that was not only good, but to actually surpass the original in some ways. The story was more interesting, the action was even better (and that's saying something), and the stakes are even higher.Keanu Reeves returns to play the title character and gives an equally great performance as the first. What elevates this film higher than the first is that it further elaborates on the world and culture John and the people around him live in and the code they operate by, and it's fascinating. The action is also faster and more thrilling, and there are more action scenes here.The film also introduces some new characters. The best one being Lawrence Fishburne's character. While he's not in the movie for very long, his presence was a very welcome addition. I hope we see more of him in Chapter 3.If there was a weak point in this film it would be the villain. He has a strong introduction, but afterwards failed to impress me. He has a history with John Wick that's never fully elaborated on (maybe in Chapter 3). I just found him very bland and boring. The villain in the first movie was not amazing either, but he was definitely more memorable.His female underling named Ruby Rose was more interesting and imposing than he was. I'm not sure if that name is a nod to RWBY or just a strange coincidence (most likely the latter). She's because not only does she kick ass but has a unique gimmick in that she's mute so she speaks via sign language.Overall, John Wick Chapter 2 is one of the best action films to come out since...the first John Wick. Both movies are the best action films to come out in a long time and should definitely be seen if you're a fan of the genre. If I had to choose which one is superior I would probably still have to go with the first film. While this movie does improve on elements from John Wick, the first film had a better villain and it was a self-contained piece with a definitive end, while this is clearly setup for the next one, even though I like the setup.",9,0,1,22 May 2019
Jurassic Park," One of My Favorite Movies Period
","Jurassic Park is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of all time. If I made a list of my favorite movies Jurassic Park would be in the top twenty or even top ten. It's an amazing experience that everyone should see if you love cinema. The characters are great and fun, it's grand, it's suspenseful, and the effects look monumental. These are among some of the best effects I've seen on film.The music is also iconic and has a lot to do with why the film is as good as it is. John Williams, in my opinion, is the greatest composer to come out of Hollywood. He's done some of the most iconic themes in movies. You have Jurassic Park, The Lost World, The Star Wars films, The Indiana Jones films, Superman The Movie, Home Alone, among others. He is a legend in the world of music.The cast is great as well. I often feel like these people are very underappreciated. Of everyone in the cast the one who has gone on to do the most by far is Samuel L. Jackson. Jeff Goldblum was big for a bit after this film but he pretty much went nowhere by the 2000s. He also gets a lot of crap from critics now which I feel is undeserved as I actually like him as an actor.Sam Neil hasn't done much either in the 2000s at least as far as American films go. He's done some TV shows which went nowhere. I feel he's one of the most underappreciated actors as he's personally one of my favorites.The same applies with Laura Dern who's probably one of my favorite actresses. Richard Attenborough also does a great job as John Hammond. He is greatly missed. The rest of the cast does good work as well.Overall, if you want a grand and epic experience or just want to see a great monster movie than here you are. Hell, if you're a fan of dinosaurs in general than this is the movie to watch. This and Land Before Time made me fascinated with dinosaurs as a kid. It was one of my favorite films then and now.",10,2,2,11 January 2019
Furious 7," A Good Sendoff To Paul Walker
","Furious 7 is a solid entry in the Fast and Furious franchise but it's, by no means, spectacular. I know you shouldn't expect too much from one of these movies, but, while, I liked and had fun with the film, I still think it's not on the same tear as the previous two movies. This is now the highest-rated movie of the franchise on Rotten Tomatoes and I don't think it warrants that. While I can definitely say I enjoyed this more than the first four installments I think it not as good as Fast Five or Six. The story has two main faults that put it bellow those films for me.The film does many things right. It is a lot of fun despite by grips with it. Vin Diesel and the rest (for the most part) reprise their roles here and they do a pretty good job. The effects, like in the last two films are very well-done as well.I also love what they did in the end. I loved the tribute to Paul Walker at the very end. It was sweet and served as a nice send-off too him. I'm glad he went out on a fairly high note. I didn't even notice it was his brother doing many of Paul's scenes. Whether it was the effects or the way it was shot, they did a good job in that regard.The action is a lot of fun as insane as it is. I warn you will have to suspend your disbelief immensely to enjoy the action here. This took the over-the-top nature that the previous films had and intensified it to the tenth power. The action seems to get crazier with each film. However, despite it was still highly entertaining. This film might have the most and greatest action scenes of all the movies; even Fast Six.However, as I stated before I have two major problems. One is that the film seems very unfocused. The previous films all had a simple structure and a basic singular goal. In this movie it starts out with Jason Statham's character hunting Toretto and the group. However, then it shifts to this completely out-of-nowhere plotline regarding the God's Eye and Djimon's character for the entire middle portion and Statham gets put on the backburner. Statham occasionally shows-up to remind us he's in the movie but not much focus is given to him.Statham should have been the main villain and focus. He's the more interesting villain and one presenting the most personal conflict for the heroes. It's like they needed this other plot just to give the rest of the cast something to do and to show more over-the-top fights. Instead he's played as more of an afterthought for most of it which is my second big problem. Also the way he gets beaten is extremely underwhelming as well. Kurt Russell is there but he doesn't get to do much either. That is more of a minor grip but it irked me.Overall, Furious 7 is an entertaining film with some great action. If you like Vin Diesel and the rest of the Fast crew (except Han) you won't be disappointed. I don't think it's as good as the previous few installments but still found it serviceable and a good send-off for Walker. If you like this series then check this out.",7,0,0,17 August 2019
