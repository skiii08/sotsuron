Black Swan," Not a bad film but overrated
","I was excited to finally see this film, I had a mild desire to see it in theaters but never got around to it. I rented it at Redbox and am happy I finally got around to it and to see what the buzz was about.In my years as a very big movie fan I have seen a lot of very good movies and a lot of movies while good aren't particularly moving for whatever reason. Either it is because of poor direction or a script or acting it just doesn't always come together for me. This is one of those times.First off, let me say that this is not a bad movie, it is however not a great one either. It is however technically very sound, the cinematography is fine, the score is effective and the lighting is good. Editing is not an issue here but what is the issue for me is an overall lack of soul that I continue to find in the work of Darren Aronofsky's work. The parts are all there to be good and overall product just doesn't seem to come together for me. Maybe it's his use of the camera and it's bouncing around that is intended to make the viewer feel like they are with the characters and in my case did the exact opposite.Natalie Portman does a fine job in this role. Her character is so stunted from her overbearing mother and her obsessive need to be a great dancer that she has no friends and no life outside of her self made shell of a life. Mila Kunis in a very interesting role plays Lilly the yang to Portman's Yin and representation of all of the repression that that overwhelmed her, a physical embodiment of all that Nina has chosen not to experience.I found the most interesting character to be the role of the ballet director Thomas. He is self assured, cocky and a great manipulator, both professionally and personally. His role is well acted by Vincent Casell and is the most entertaining character in the film. Watching him try to pull the vigor and emotion from Portman's Nina and his attempts to seduce her are the most interesting thing in the movie.The film ranges from melodrama to thriller and almost borders on horror in a few parts. It goes from straight forward storytelling and as the film progresses it attempts to show the loss of sanity of Nina becomes more and more surreal and the effect is uneven at best.My thoughts have always been that Aronofsky is a sound director but never very moving. Good but not great, he doesn't elevate the material he touches but I don't feel he brings it down either. A fine movie but once the credits roll it is not haunting and not all that memorable.",6,0,0,16 May 2011
Skyfall," The best Bond in 40+ years
","Let me say that I am am James Bond fan. I have seen all of the movies and multiple times. They have been a part of my youth from seeing For Your Eyes Only in a theater as a little boy and almost every other movie since then the same way. They hold an important place in my familial history as it's a common love of a good number of my clan who may not agree on much but sure love 007.Skyfall is the single most entertaining Bond movie I have seen in theaters ever. I can say this because as I am 34 I wasn't alive to see the Connery movies and of course they are considered (rightfully in my opinion) to be the gold standard.The ongoing problem I had with the franchise as a whole was that from my perspective the movies had become dull and boring. They were becoming parodies and Pierce Brosnan has just so smooth and snarky he just didn't fit the bill for what I wanted to see anymore, the issue was that I didn't know what it was I wanted until I saw Casino Royale.What I got in CR was Daniel Craig as a (dare I say it?!) rebooted Bond. He was newly minted in his double '0' status and learning his way through things. But Craig brought a brutality and a menace to Bond, something I'd always wanted because after all he is a KILLER first. I remember hearing the groans when he was hired and how the internet blew-up with scorn and fear and I kept hearing about Layer Cake and how that one movie had gotten him the gig. So, I jumped up and rented the movie and was simply riveted by the performance he gave; cold, calculated and straight-up cool. After that I knew that I was interested to see what they did and boy I was happy with the outcome.Skyfall sees Bond as a well footed and established agent, he isn't learning the ropes now, he's maybe now a bit long in the tooth for a field agent and coming to grips with what he and others wonder if he can do it much longer. It is this sense of humanity that I love so much about the movie. Bond is shot in the first 10-15 minutes and thought dead. He comes back to MI6 when Silva (Bardem) attacks and threatens the lives of M (Dench) and deep cover agents true identities around the world (typical Bond plot so far right?). The kicker here is that Bond is weakened and unfit for active duty but it is his resolve and intensity that is called for to save the day.To say that Craig is my favorite modern Bond is pretty obvious, he is amazing in a modern age in a franchise that has embraced a more realistic approach (no invisible cars here). It is Javier Bardem's Silva who is the truly remarkable performance here and needs to be seen to be appreciated. My thoughts on the matter are this: Silva is Bond's Joker in that he is the perfect mirror image of him. A former agent himself and just as cold blooded he is a true menace and a match both physically and mentally for Bond. Not sense Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight have I been this entertained by a villain. It should be noted that this is the first post-Dark Knight Bond movie and I think it shows in the writing and in the execution. We like seeing our hero's struggle with their own mortality and the days of capturing spacecraft with another spacecraft to try to start WWIII are over. This is a Bond movie that knows the history of the franchise and respects it but is throughly modern in it's approach.Some will say the movie lacks action, and while I don't feel it misses it I can see why they say it does. This isn't a ton of car chases or gadgets and crazy evil plan movie that people have become accustomed to and for that I think it's the reason so many are turned-off to it. It's more human and for the first time in any of the Bond movies makes James and M actual people. There is history here and there is a soul and that is the most compelling part of the movie.In summation this is the first Bond movie that isn't a traditional Bond movie. This could have been a stand alone film and stood up just as well without the connotation or expectation of what a Bond movie is. Sam Mendes should be commended for strong direction and for making this better than a Bond movie 10/10.",10,41,68,14 February 2013
The Big Lebowski," Quite possibly the greatest movie of all time
","Let me say first off that I HATED this movie the first time I walked out of it. I did however watch it again over the years and I have to think it was just my age at the time (I was 19) and now being the ripe old age of 32 I have to say I might enjoy this for repeat viewings more than anything else.So, what makes this movie great? First off, it has one of the single best scripts I have ever seen. It is funny, weird and incredibly quotable. The characters are well drawn and so odd that you can't help but love them. The Coen brothers have made some very good movies but nothing compares to the utter genius displayed here.The Big Lebowski exists on the plain of earth that we just don't inhabit. In this film LA is a magical place that walks the along edge of lunacy. A bit mythological and just subversive to keep us coming back again and again for a great movie that never loses it's sparkle.The Dude Abides...",10,1,4,3 March 2011
The Aviator," Just wonderful
",I cannot say enough good things about this film. It is wonderfully acted and the direction is top notch. Dicaprio does an excellent job in his portrayal of Howard Hughes and Cate Blanchett is truly perfect casting as Catherine Hepburn. The photography is so reminiscent of the old techni-color films and lends so much to the time you almost get swept up in the film which is written so well. It is quite long but really truly worth it. If you love old Hollywood run out and see it you will LOVE it! The flight scenes as so beautiful and so well crafted that I want to see Scorsese do something else relating to flight to see what else he can do. This really should win him his first Best Director Oscar and achievement is well deserved.,9,3,14,27 December 2004
Bridesmaids," Hell yes!
","You know what makes a movie like this so good? It is that the movie is funny. Not funny in a ha ha, that was good way but you look at the person next to you and you are both equally shocked at how good the movie really is. Do the actors do their job? is the script funny? is the direction good? The answer to all of these questions is yes.We have seen over the last 10 or so years some really funny movies, and all of them feature women as secondary characters who might be a little funny but the focus is never on them for too long. Here the movie takes what could be another piece of garbage about girls doing the things they do before they get married and elevates it to a level of greatness that only the best of comedies can achieve.Kristen Wiig wrote and stars as Annie, a down on her luck 30-something woman in Milwaukee, WI who is looking for stability after her bakery shut down. She has a job she hates working at a jewelery store selling wedding rings to people in love. She lives with the most vile brother and sister possibly ever and her best friend who she has known from childhood Lillian is getting married in Chicago to a rich guy with a great job. Lillian is still the same great friend that she has always been and no matter how much money or influence her new social circle affords her it doesn't change how she treats Annie and that is commendable and a nice change.The movie is great, it isn't afraid to be dirty and raunchy and it loves the weird stuff that the women all do. It makes the women here equals with anything you might see in other Judd Apatow/frat pack movies and it gets the tone right. It could be done wrong on so many levels but it doesn't go for the cheap way out and it makes the movie fun and inventive and very good.Cons: It is too damned long, I don't know why this is the case with all Apatow movies her either directs or produces but damn, cut it down please. The subplots are a bit much in a couple of places and could be tightened up but this is a minor flaw in comparison.Go see this movie, it will make you laugh and it will do it often. Great flick!",8,2,5,16 May 2011
Drive," Not for everybody but I LOVED this movie
","I am a movie geek and I have been my whole life. This movie represents what I love in movies. Well crafted story, great writing and great direction. I rented this movie yesterday at Redbox and found it to be so well crafted that I watched it again (I don't usually do that.I grew up in Los Angeles and when I loved about this movie is that it gives you a real sense of the city and it's dirty underbelly that is usually missed in more common films.Ryan Gosling is so good in this movie because he isn't the prototypical bad ass that you usually would see in a movie like this and that is what I loved about it. Here is a character who is equally quiet but nice guy who obviously has a lot of history but nothing is mentioned or anything acknowledged up front.The tone is fantastic and I love that the director avoided the classic clichés that are so rampant in movies like this by giving us what is essentially a 'B' movie and fills it with great actors and allows them to do what they do best. WOW!Albert Brooks is the Oscar snub of the year by far and I don't know how. Here is a guy who is always good at what he does and is a brilliant comedian but here he is a former small time movie producer who has deep roots in the criminal underworld and is so convincing that you have a hard time believing that this is the same guy from Lost in America or Nemo's dad. Nuance is the best tool in the performance and I can tell you that this is an understated performance that is so layered you just can't help but feel for the guy even though he is a brutal killer. He wants to be a nice guy but his actions and his business don't allow him to be.No movie was as cool and more riveting from start to finish than this one. It is my favorite movie of 2011, case closed.",10,19,28,1 February 2012
Ghost Rider," Why oh Why did they make this so bad?
","I like comic book movies, I however do not live them or know everything about them. I did read Ghost Rider as a kid/early teen and it was cool. By far one of the Best looking characters ever created, but this movie took all that was great about the comics and the character and made them just lame!First there is Nicolas Cage, I personally wasn't thrilled with his casting but I didn't hate it. He was fine in the movie good deadpan delivery and he is a good actor. But here he is just so flat and boring to watch. Eva Mendes is drop dead, sell your should to Satan hot but her character is so poorly constructed that you just don't care about her.The story is so redundant, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) is looking for a scroll with the names and souls of a bunch of people that will give him ultimate power to Ahem, RULE THE WORLD!!!! So he naturally needs to enlist the power some boring glorified movie extras who possess useless powers of Earth,Wind and Water OHHHHH I am so scared!Ghost Rider kills the minions in literally a matter of seconds with no build-up or fight just a couple of hits a bad line and then poof the bad guy is vanquished. The part of the movie that is so bad is that you never care about anyone at any time throughout the movie.The great part about other Marvel movies is that you feel for these people and want to see them succeed here you don't care because there is almost no feeling in the writing at all!Effects are good but really not close to great, the editing is kind of sloppy and the writing is just so lame. This one wasn't quite as bad as Daredevil but it is close.Last but not least the one thing that really doomed this production is the fact that it drowned in it's fear of being offensive, violent and have any edge at all. Something like maybe a tortured character like Blaze really is would be cool or some real fight sequences would help a lot too.Just too many things to deal with here and no real redeeming qualities.",3,0,2,19 February 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Sony steps in to ruin Spider-Man....again
","Simply stated, this movie is a bloated mess. Too many characters, too many plots and no real reason for most of it. I really liked The Amazing Spider-Man. I thought it was a welcome departure from what had become of the Raimi franchise after Sony stepped in and sabotaged the narrative to shoehorn an underdeveloped Eddie Brock/Venom and unnecessary comedic elements. With this version of Spider-Man we got a better Peter Parker and we actually got a true Gwen Stacy. We saw Gwen become Peter's first love and knew that her eventual demise would become the next defining moment for Peter to become the hero he's destined to be. Instead we are short changed by a flabby screenplay that attempts to spin too many plates and leaves the viewer feeling short changed. First off, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are great together. Good chemistry is not the issue here, bad writing is. The foreshadowing of her eventual death is so heavy handed at times that when it finally does happen it's poignancy is lost. Jamie Foxx is a good actor but he is given very little to work with in terms of depth of character so immediately he just feels one dimensional and flat. Dane Dehann shows up as Harry Osborne and is suddenly thrust into this plot that just doesn't have enough room for him to develop as he should. Action is fine when it occurs and Garfield's wisecracks and personality are still the highlight of the movie for me. He and Stone work great and you believe in their relationship. It's the villains that have no motivation or weight. Their expository dialogue pushing the story forward but never giving a real reason to hate the web slinger.Stone is smart, fearless and a welcome addition to what is usually a thankless role for most women in these types of movies. She doesn't have the powers of Peter Parker but her existence in the film is more than just damsel in distress. Sony is to blame for this movie because like in SM3 they tried to fit in too many characters and didn't develop them like they need to be. Here the push for The Sinister Six and for a Venom movie are so obvious that feels like one big commercial for the next movies instead of a compelling story in this movie now. This idea of an expanded universe poisons the plot and gives us almost no emotional stakes or interest as this whole movie feels like a 2 hour trailer for another movie. It's a shame. but this movie just simply isn't that good and that's just too bad.",6,11,24,24 April 2014
