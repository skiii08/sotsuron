The Ring," In seven days...
","I'm glad I could make it home safe after watching 'The Ring'. The movie itself was not that frightening but the ending was so stunning and scary, I walked out of the cinema like a ghost with my eyes opened unusually wide. Not easily scared by movies,  I don't know how much time will it take until I touch a video tape again. The movie is about this mysterious video tape, that whoever watches it, gets an immediate phone call where he's being notified about his death in seven days. If he or she doesn't believe it, well, they will one week later, after experiencing one absolutely terrifying encounter with a TV. But if he DOES believe it, he will try to prevent his own death, exactly what Naomi Watts' character, Rachel, did in the movie. This was the was the first time I saw Naomi in a movie and I was definitely impressed by her performance. Being a professional reporter, Rachel has no problem breaking into strange people houses, killing horses, stealing things - the usual stuff reporters do, but this time not only for the article in a newspaper, but also for her and her 'family' lives.  David Dorfman plays Rachels son, unsuccessfully trying to make the second Haley Joel Osment, but he definitely brings some thrilling, unforgettable lines('Don't You get it, she never sleeps').  Daveigh Chase, the voice of Lilo in 'Lilo & Stitch', plays exactly the opposite role here in a performance that would even scare the hell out of Stitch himself. Gore Verbinski , the director, makes it up here for his disastrous 'The Mexican'. Hopefully, he's on the right way. Go see this movie. Don't worry, You won't die in seven days after seeing it.",9,1,2,18 April 2003
