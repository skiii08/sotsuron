Despicable Me 2," Good film, but inferior to the previous installment
","I had the chance to watch both the first and second film on a flight from Seoul to Singapore. The first one came out in 2010 and I was busy doing my national service hence I never had the chance to watch it. The first one was a pleasant surprise and I loved the idea of focus on a bad guy turning good of sorts. The second installment tried to expand on the story and foundation based on the first one. It worked alright, but it was predictable at times. Also, I always felt that the minions steel the thunder from Gru. It could have been better if the bond between Gru and his adopted daughters were explored further. In the end it's natural movie goers will get a spin off of the minion movie. It's a fun movie to watch with a child, but there is was no two times the charm.",6,1,1,5 February 2014
