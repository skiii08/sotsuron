Blade Runner 2049," I like Arrival but not Blade Runner
",-Too much negative emotion. No sense of humor along those dark atmosphere. -Soundtrack is too much build-up...especially in the ending credit it's very very annoy me and kick people out of cinema right away. (cuz normally I'm the one who watch credit in the end) -It's like I stay in hell for a long time but I haven't learned or found something important much. - Maybe I'm stupid or something but I don't get key message.ps. I haven't watched the old blade runner.,4,10,21,8 October 2017
