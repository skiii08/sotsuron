","Behind the racing car is the vanity fair under the influence of capital. The real driver is always chasing the pure speed and the integration of man and machine. At the end of anti climax, the reality is so treacherous.",9,2,3,22 April 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America: The Winter Soldier
","There's a humility in Captain America that many superheroes don't see. The captain of the United States deserves your cheers and cheers, because he keeps his integrity and clear mind and sticks to his position.",8,1,1,14 June 2020
Doctor Strange," Doctor Strange
","It's actually a story about time. The cycle of time goes beyond endless time. But for all the people, the most important thing is undoubtedly the passing time symbolized by that watch, which is more precious because it's gone forever. The whole is fresh.",8,0,0,20 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood
","At the end of the movie, the director made a bold, creative and plausible treatment, which put a warm veil on the bloody and cruel historical facts, just like the path towards the Polansky mansion with full moon light. Let all the simple, beautiful and vivid stay on the screen, which is the most unique and attractive charm of the film.",9,0,2,22 April 2020

","Many people may be imprisoned by their own cages! No light, no tomorrow, no hope! Maybe you will sink because of this, but also may break through it, defeat it, and finally win the self sublimation! This movie seems to tell us that! Every time I watch it, every time I feel touched, I can have a lot of hope!",9,0,1,20 May 2020

","Three groups of families, a total of ten characters, everyone is indispensable. Put the furniture and structural features of a house to the extreme. The huge gap between the upper class and the bottom floor is materialized by the height of the living space. The scenes of going up and down the stairs repeatedly, though straightforward, are just right. What's terrible about the director is that he has excellent directing skills and the ability to write stories. When he conceives the plot, he always thinks about how to present it to the audience.",9,1,1,14 April 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Knight Rises
","Nolan has never let me down. Even the personal heroism that has never been interested in has been interpreted reasonably and acceptably. I can't imagine Batman's better performance. Even if there is no beautiful soul, no wonderful story, more than 100 minutes belonging to the film is enough to relax and intoxicate. Maybe the reality is boring and tiresome, which is more compared with the dream and graceful appearance of the film.",9,0,0,16 May 2020

","A good movie is never responsible for setting up three views, but only expressing it, and then leaving the rest to the audience to choose.",7,0,0,12 May 2020
