First Man," A TV Movie on Huge Budget
","Ryan Gosling seems able to do just about anything on screen successfully. For director Damian Chazelle, he got La La Land - an otherwise unmemorable film musical - across the finish line admirably, even though he did not receive due credit for it. In First Man, he tries valiantly, but in the end the production values and the enormity of the story weigh him down, a burden he pushed aside in La La. First Man is only incidentally about the moon mission. Principally, it is about Neil Armstrong the man himself. The film practically ties itself in knots - unnecessarily, in my opinion - to show Armstrong as single-handedly committed to making the Gemini/Apollo program a success. The script carefully portrays Armstrong as somewhat one-mindedly committed to his flying career, cleverly linking it to Broadway musicals in his youth - a monomania for some theatre wonks. (He even revered Gilbert & Sullivan, the Holy Grail for true musical nerds). Gosling seems to be finding his balance between the pilot-Armstrong and the family-Armstrong several times , only to be interrupted by NASA wizardry, which would have been better served by being more tightly delineated. Claire Foy ably assists in a role which should have been more a principal focus. Foy's portrayal of Neil's wife, Janet, could have been seen as the home front spouse who nurtured Armstrong's familial side which she surely did. But the only dynamic indications of this we see come across as angry more than determined. However, First Man is Gosling's charge, and he does everything possible to bring it home. Chazelle could have helped a lot had he seen the project as more Whiplash - a virtually perfect film - than La La Land.",6,33,75,7 October 2018
A Star Is Born," Title might better have A Star Falls
","Bradley Cooper - Producer-Director-Writer-Star - dominates the screen, except when Lady Gaga is singing. His performance is a tour de force, surely worthy of award nomination. However, the title - now in its fourth iteration - is A Star is Born, and we don't get to see too much of that. We already know how brilliantly Lady Gaga's singing is, so that comes as no surprise. The focus needed to be on how this acknowledged songstress overcomes other obstacles. Instead, we get to see how her mentor (Cooper) unravels, no spoiler as it is obvious from the first frame of the film. Aside from singing - always glorious - Lady Gaga isn't given much to do; what there is, she acquits quite well. Cooper got the film he wanted, and he doesn't disappoint. But it deserved more.",5,8,15,7 October 2018
Lion," A Winning Effort for Dev Patel
","Dev Patel saves this film which would otherwise be a bit of a muddle. There are many winning qualities - the beautiful cinematography, the apparently accurate but still sympathetic portrayal of the Indian condition, the sweeping feel of the narrative itself, and most especially the winning portrayal of young Saroo as a 5-year-old. But without Patel these qualities would not be enough. Realizing that this is an Australian film (Australian story-telling techniques often utilize different formats than American), the loose ends are still distracting. Characters and details are presented and then dropped without regard to continuity. Continuing characters go through changes that are not even hinted before they are portrayed. The screenplay is based on a memoir by Patel's character; the book itself is often described as a novel. So we are left to question just how much was truly remembered and how much was supplemented. (Patel's alter ego did not write screenplay.) No matter. Patel hurtles through all of this and makes it work. Now he needs to start finding some non-ethnic roles; he certainly has the chops.",6,5,12,7 November 2016
Jackie," Creepy, or just detached?
","This film shows a Jackie Kennedy that we did not know. While there is nothing revealed of which we weren't already aware, albeit in fits and starts over the years, assembling it all as 'Jackie' does is certainly a fresh approach. One must decide if we are watching a dissection or a hit job, for in many ways, it is not flattering. Natalie Portman's acting chops are well displayed. Her portrayal is certainly not a mirror image. She actually looks less like Jackie than many of the actresses who have preceded her. But since many other actors in the film only vaguely resemble their actual characters, a look-alike image was probably not intended. Her voice suggests Jackie's very unique sound and speech pattern, but it is not the same. Again, probably not intended to be. The film's scenario covers the week following the President's assassination with strategic flashbacks interspersed. It is difficult to discern whether the actual dialogue can be confirmed, or if it has simply been re-imagined with some degree of hoped-for accuracy. Director Pablo Larrain is Chilean. Reportedly, he speaks little English. This isn't necessarily a handicap, but it certainly could make for some very unusual choices - Among them: Vice-President Lyndon Johnson was surely not the hapless bystander that he is portrayed here; Attorney General Bobby Kennedy did not defer so eloquently to Jackie (we know that from several sources; they didn't even like each other very much); the Kennedy children couldn't possibly have been so detached from the proceedings. The script may have allowed for that interpretation, but the director would have needed to secure it. And where were the rest of the Kennedy clan? They barely appear in the film, and this is not at all like them. Writer Noah Oppenheim's two previous scripts - Allegiant and The Maze Runner - are nothing like Jackie. It had been on the Hollywood Black List (well-regarded screenplays which can't seem to get a green-light) as early as 2010. Darren Aronofsky, to direct and/or produce, had been attached early on; he is hardly a mainstream choice. Portman herself had been approached as early 2012. (Rachel Weisz, the earlier choice, dropped out when she and Aronofsky split up.) She wouldn't even commit until knowing who would direct. Larrain was chosen even though he didn't like doing bio-pics and had no experience as a women's director, to say nothing about never having directed an American film. Aronofsky stayed on as the producer. The main interiors were shot on a soundstage in Paris. The designers and crew mostly Europeans. In short, Jackie is a non-traditional package -- and it comes off that way. It is beautifully done in exquisite detail. Virtually nothing is out of place. The score, from Mica Levi whose previous film credits are eerie, makes a very intense statement. And it is relentless. As a bio-pic, Jackie is an outlying member of the Jacqueline Kennedy canon. As a mainstream film, it is unsettling... even creepy. It will be interesting to see how the Kennedy partisans receive it. My guess is.. not well.",6,4,10,3 December 2016
Rules of Engagement," One wonders what the reviews would be if this were released today
","'Rules of Engagement' is NOT 'A Few Good Men.' But it is also not the travesty that many reviews have made it out to be. The film was released in 2000, prior to the events of 9/11/2001 in New York City. Much has transpired since then, and Americans are slowly coming to the realization that, while not all Muslims hate us, the haters are all Muslims. And that is becoming increasingly significant, especially given the results of the 2016 election. 'Rules of Engagement' takes a crack at explaining how difficult it is to fight Muslim extremists, whose tactics violate all the 'rules' of warfare. Muslim extremist gunmen constantly use 'innocent' civilians as shields, knowing full well that American troops will find it difficult to shoot back. 'Rules of Engagement' revolves around this dilemma. Considering when it was produced and exhibited, this was not destined to be well received. Screenwriter Stephen Gagnan and story writer Jim Webb (yes, that Jim Webb) are not fanatics; their resumes show them both to be thoughtful and respected. It is unlikely they would be telling a story they did not believe in, just as director William Friedkin would not be bringing it to the screen if he did not believe it had a valid point to make. Before 9/11, the pacifist persuasion in the United States was imposing a heavy hand of deterrence on the American military. 'Rules of Engagement' basically advocates that the enemy has to be taken out, even if it means collateral damage. Of course this elicited hoots of derision in 2000. A year or more later, with a lot of collateral damage in downtown New York, the reaction would undoubtedly have been much different. Many reviews have pointed out inconsistencies, factual errors, glib script devices, even casting anomalies. True, but inconsequential. 'Rules of Engagement' is intended to point out the folly of the United States' approach to its enemies in a war unlike any other - a war we are still fighting 16 years later. It made its point, just a year too soon.",6,21,27,21 December 2016
Green Street Hooligans," Is all British football this awful
","There must be something redeeming about British football, but I have yet to find it. Media representations, both factual and fictional, seem largely concerned with bad behavior by young (and not so young) males. (To be fair, male American football fans aren't a whole lot better, just less violent.} Elijah Wood portrays Matt, a young American student at Harvard who is falsely accused of drug-dealing and expelled. That plot gets lost early on, but it does get him to London, where he bunks with his sister (Claire Forlani, a Brit, herself playing an American), now married to a Brit. Her brother-in-law, Pete (Charlie Hunnam), a football hooligan, is also on the scene. He is delegated to help Matt adjust to life in London, an assignment Pete is initially not thrilled about. Events spiral downhill from there. Wood is well-cast as the straight arrow Harvard boy who (for whatever reason) takes the fall for his well-connected, politically ambitious, drug dealer roommate. He is thrust into the violent Hooligan culture of London and takes to it. Hunnam, who has been criticized for his accent, realizes that film is an international commodity, and English is the language of commercially successful films. Actors have to be understood everywhere, not just locally. Most of his mates don't get that, and it makes much of the dialogue problematic. Forlani is given little to do and does little with it. This could have been a brilliant film; Wood always has the potential to make his vehicles be so. But it does not achieve that goal, and British football is the culprit. It is hard to sympathize with anything which finds its inspiration in a sport typified by the unruly behavior of its advocates.",5,2,3,15 November 2016
Joker," For Joaquin fans, this is a field day...
","...for the rest of us, not so much. Does Warner Bros really want to take its franchise down this road?",5,3,16,6 October 2019
Arrival," Midnight Special did it better
","The new Sci-Fi effort, 'Arrival', isn't exactly a new idea. Going back to '2001-A Space Odyssey', and most recently 'Midnight Special', stories about communicating with aliens haven't lacked for examination. In this piece, aliens arrive at various sites around the globe, and (surprise!) they don't have any known language. Amy Adams, as a renowned linguistic prof, is recruited to communicate with them. She is in a race with other 'communicators' to find out why the aliens have shown up; the various governments aren't good at cooperating. No spoilers there. To my only very basic linguistic-trained experience, the linguistics in this instance are spot on. The science seems at least a bit shaky. The fantasy... well, it's waaay out there. In spite of all that, thanks to Amy Adams, the film does work on a storytelling level. Her character uses linguistics, along with her partner (played by Jeremy Renner), a mathematician, to decode the aliens' language. The task is time-consuming, and of course belligerents around the world get impatient. Can she beat the clock? That is her assignment, and she knows it from the very beginning. Adams, as always, is terrific. (Like Jennifer Lawrence, there doesn't seem to be any role Adams can't bring off.) Renner's subtle but positive influence is significant. He doesn't have a lot to do, but he makes good use of his assignment. Forest Whittaker, as the sympatico but hard-pressed military commander, is good but forgettable. Without Adams, there would be no film. Director Denis Villaneuve realizes this and makes good use of her. He would have been well assisted with a more cohesive script.",6,10,30,16 October 2016
Annihilation," ANNIHILATION isn't long enugh.
","At least half of the films I see need cutting. Most film stories can be told in two hours or less; this one can't. I haven't read the novel; I didn't know that it is the first of a trilogy. But it's not just a matter of restoring fifteen minutes of cuts. I'm guessing that the missing material isn't on the cutting room floor; I'm fairly confident that it was never filmed - or even screen-written - in the first place. The science - reference to which is fleeting - is barely exposed. And yet it is at the heart of the mystery of the film. The character development is spotty, leaving it mostly to what they say about themselves; this is almost never complete enough, always unreliable. Lena does divine their truths, or at least enough of it to get by on, but although it seems to satisfy her, it does not satisfy the film. Too many loose ends - or worse, too many surprises. Shock value may be horror film fodder, but this film aspires to greater things which it should have achieved. Too many plot lines are left hanging, and the penultimate sequence is just plain bizarre. (I can't call it disconnected because the unexplained events up to that point are not really connected, either.) No spoilers here, but just exactly where does it come from? Natalie Portman is competent but predictable (in a film that isn't, depending on your expectations). Oscar Isaac seems to have wandered in from some other film (which according to scuttlebutt at the time, he actually did.) Gina Rodriguez seemed to be warding off Jane the Virgin. She only partially succeeded; elements of her TV character kept creeping in. Jennifer Jason Leigh found her character masterfully, but then had very little opportunity to develop it. This did not make her last appearance easy or credible. In short, ANNIHILATION needed to be a limited series on Netflix, Amazon or Hulu. This rendition at least needed too much exposition for a feature film.",5,1,2,19 March 2018
