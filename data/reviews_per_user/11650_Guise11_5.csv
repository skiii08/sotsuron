The Blair Witch Project," Pretty good
","I got this movie as a Christmas present in 2000. I watched it the next day, and at first I hated it. I really hated it. Maybe it was because I was watching it in broad daylight, and things didn't seem as scary as they would have at night. Also I hated the way it was filmed, I really hated it. But then as time went on I watched it again. And again. And it grew on me. I began to appreciate the innovative style in which the movie was filmed, and allowed myself to suspend disbelief which resulted in me enjoying the movie and finding it quite eerie and spooky. I understand why a lot of people might not like this movie, as after all I was one of them once. Also I understand why a lot of people will hate it because you don't see anything attacking the students or you don't see the Blair Witch. I guess this is the sort of movie that you either love, like or hate. I like it. But avoid at ALL COSTS the sequel - Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows. Don't touch it with a 10 foot cattle-prod.",Null,0,1,27 June 2003
Scary Movie 2," Death Defying Action!
","Scary Movie 2 was described by the Producers as being full of Death Defying Action. Oh really! Well I'll say this. The only 'Death Defying Action' which you'll experience during watching Scary Movie 2 is managing not to die of boredom! As many people have already said on the comments page here, I was a big fan of the first Scary Movie. It was very funny. Unfortunetly, this sequel is neither funny, nor interesting. It has no real plot and although it starts brightly, it quickly runs out of steam. Personally, if I were a main actor in this movie, I think I would lose a lot of credibility. Of course, Scary Movie 2 is not supposed to be taken seriously, which is why it doesn't appeal to many people. To get the jokes, u have to have seen quite a few horror movies to 'get' the jokes. Jokes? Hmmmm. Indeed, I spent 2 hours laughing so much at Scary Movie 2's hilarious gags and zany knockabout comedy that I: a) Split my sides laughing and am now carrying 25 stitches in my midriff b) Dislocated my jaw during the riotous masterpiece that was the 'clown under the bed routine' c) Was suffering from oxygen starvation due to protracted laughing. Uhh...no. Not really. In fact, this movie is FAR from funny. I'd rather set my new sofa on fire than watch this pile of junk again, so take my advice. DONT WATCH IT!!!!",Null,1,1,13 October 2002
The Exorcist," I've seen scarier cartoons
","Alright maybe I haven't but please, come on. This movie is NOT scary at all you pussies! I saw this in March 2001 on my own, in the living room at 11:30pm with a bottle of beer, expecting to be scared out of my wits. There I sat for the whole movie, waiting to be 'scared out of my wits'. It never came. In fact, when the movie ended I thought to myself 'Is that it!?!' I couldn't believe how overrated and overhyped this is. In fact, I found it more funny than scary. In FACT, this out to be classed as a comedy, because I sure as heck laughed more times in this than I have in any other so called 'Horror' movies. I almost laughed as much as I did when I came to this page, seeing the countless comments saying 'This movie scared me. It's terrifying! I can't sleep anymore! Help!!!' Gee guys, get a grip. Look at it as it is. It's not real. It's a movie. It's funny. It's not scary. All this bull about the 'curse' of the Exorcist, i.e. the production problems they ran into is preposterous. Of course, they shot it and made it for over a year. During that time it's very possible someone is going to get sick, someone is going to fall down in the shower and someone is going to die of natural causes. That's NOT a curse morons!! Oh man, the bottom line is that The Exorcist is NOT as scary as people make out. The Exorcist is pretty darn COMICAL if you have a view on life as I do. Thanks kids.",Null,1,2,20 October 2002
Ghostbusters," The Greatest Movie There Ever Was!
","What can I say about this masterpiece which already hasn't been said? I would have commented on this movie a long time ago, had my attention not been occupied by the ridiculous movies that deserved my verbal bashing, such as Scary Movie 2. Usually I only write reviews in order to pour scorn on the sad brainless authors, directors and actors, but in this case I make an exception. Quite simply, Ghostbusters is the best movie ever made. It is funny and entertaining. The music score is off the chart, the acting brilliant, the visual effects (for 1984) brilliant (even more so considering that at the time the most common notion of 'digital' was the wristwatch) and the outcome amazing. I'd say most people have seen this movie, but if you haven't i absolutely URGE you to watch this. Quite simply breathtaking. Murray is at his best here, he is my favourite actor and it's mainly because of his role in this film. Danny Aykroyd also super, Ramis also...EVERYONE! Believe it or not I have seen Ghostbusters over 300 times, and i still laugh at bits I never laughed at before. My favourite movie of ALL TIME! WATCH IT!!!",Null,0,1,24 October 2002
The Terminal," Would Somebody Please Slap Spielberg?
","The Terminal has 90 minutes of good film in it. Each and every scene is beautifully directed by Spielberg, the camera direction is pretty impressive!! The storyline is also good.. as are a lot of the scenes. However, as much as The Terminal has good things about it.. there are also bad things..Spielberg should have got a decent producer, like Michael C. Gross to slap him or hit him in the face with an iron wrench for every minute that he goes over 90. Basically this movie contains a lot of un-necessary scenes, which draws it out far too much. I got extremely restless after an hour and a half and just when I thought the movie was about to end, it carried again and again. Maybe this is a Spielberg flaw.. the fact that he feels every character that Hanks meets should have his/her own storyline. Nobody cares about them!! And what was with Catherine Zeta Jones.. nobody could possibly believe in a romance between her and Hanks.. thats just bad casting. Now, MAYBE if it was an actress who nobody knows about who isn't that great looking, that would be a lot more viable. And a lot cheaper to pay too!And what was with a female custom officer marrying a food trucker who she never even met before!! That was so ridiculous and un-necessary to the narrative of the movie. If The Terminal cut out all of these stupid scenes it would be a pleasurable 90 minutes which would please everyone.. So Mr Spielberg please bear that in mind for your next movie!Conclusively.. The Terminal is good.. but so long that the quality of this movie is diluted severely. 6/10",Null,1,3,13 September 2004
