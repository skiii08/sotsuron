The Devil's Advocate," Deliciously sexy!!
","I saw this film first about a year ago and then insisted that my boyfriend bought me it for my birthday (I know, cheeky).  It is such a brilliant film and I don't know if it is me but there isn't really that much sex and if there is it isn't particularly gratuitous.  Both Keanu and Al appeal to the audience in particular the female audience (ha!ha!).  It is amazing to think that Al was 57 when he made this film because in all honesty he is still sexy but I suppose I'm biased because I think Al is the sexiest bloke alive!!  Probably the most excellent aspect of this film is the way it deals with superficiality. The way Keanu's character embraces the glamorous New York lifestyle and women over his wife who after the 'make over' is not a beautiful as she once was but inside she still is beautiful.  Instead he fantasises about the mysterious italian character who in truth is dead inside.  Al's character constantly gives Keanu's character the opportunity to get out but regardless Keanu is striving for power and wealth over the pursuit of a happy private life.  Basically all I can say is this film is just excellent and just get it out on video however, if you're easily offended I recommend you leave it on the video shop shelf.",Null,0,0,15 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Please give us brits some slack!!
","Ok !!! I admit it you americans did liberate my grandad from a prison camp in germany in WWII but please why do you always make us brits out to be upper class fools.  I mean in this film Mr Spielberg decided we all would come strolling out and say 'Oh dear there seems to be a jolly awful rumpus going on lets have a cup of tea and a crumpet while the americans single handedly win the war for us' yeah maybe a large exaggeration but I'm sure many of you will have gotten the idea.  Apart from this the film was fair if not slightly over hyped and in honesty Tom Hanks grated a bit, then again he always does in my mind.  It would be unfair to call it a poor film because the film making does have its merits and apart from that is an extremely entertaining film",Null,0,1,15 July 1999
