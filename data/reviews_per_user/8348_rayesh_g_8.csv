Saturday Night Fever," Sex, Drugs and Dance
","'Saturday night fever' is not just a movie about dance or the usual Teenage lust for sex and drugs, in fact it is a well crafted biopic of an ordinary teenager raised in a dysfunctional family and who is struggling to find his true purpose. John Travolta stars as Tony Manero; a 19 year old kid who works at a paint shop in the daytime earning his petty cash to spend it during weekends to go to a disco club with his mates. At the club, Tony is treated as a king, the alpha male (a status he earned through his smooth dancing skills). Everyone notice him and greet him. Women are charmed by his moves and ask him to dance with them. Club goers compliment him by saying 'You know something, Tony? You always seem to be in control'. This attention and freedom that he receives at the club is far more pleasurable than what he experience at his house; his family life. There is no respect for each other in the family; they fight over the silliest matter when having dinner. His parents are overly proud of their eldest son who is a priest and this make Tony somewhat inferior, and he faces constant pressure over the decisions he has made in his life. It is not surprising that such a youth would hunt for some form of release to breakthrough from this misery. For some, it usually involves drugs and other abusive substances, but for Tony it is Dance, and Dance is what he could always think about. It is at this dance club where he stumbles upon Stephanie; another good dancer who is more mature in age, beliefs and attitudes than Tony. Even though they possess these contrasting traits, the way that life has dealt with both of them has never been more similar. They both depend on one another to make themselves feel better. This movie explores deeper themes than it appears on the surface. Matters we sometimes resist to tap into, and director John Badham has achieved these immediate goals. The pure film-making used to shoot the dance scenes encompassing funky tunes are another aspect to pay close attention to. One of the best films of the 80's.",8,0,2,24 January 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino does it again !!!!!
","Tarantino's war/comedy/western/action movie is quite simply one of the best movies of the year. Here he approaches the movie with the enthusiasm and energy that was shown in 'Pulp Fiction'. The screwy dialogues, beautiful cinematography, and wonderful performances which adds up to the definition of a trademark Tarantino movie are all evident here. It is so refreshing to know that there are directors with some juice in them who are capable of entertaining an audience in a unique and innovative fashion, during a time when movies have become merely another vehicle to make money. 'Inglourios Basterds' stars Brad Pitt as a man named Aldo Raine with a heavy southern accent who gathers a bunch of men to go behind deep enemy lines and do one thing and one thing only; kill the Nazis. These men with various aliases kill Nazi soldiers in the most shocking ways that one could hardly absorb the shock that these scenes contain. I myself was shocked at a sudden scalping in an early scene of the movie that I was terrified I would throw up. These instances can easily make you fall into the trap of expressing distaste about the violence and coincidently hatred towards the director, but I myself found that the shock those images created filled me with anticipation it made me aware how anything could happen in this movie. That sense of surprise and suspense is what makes Basterds a great movie. The most effective way to not glorify violence is to make it so shocking and sudden. There is a key scene involving a German spy, some basterds and Nazi soldiers, and it is so well constructed that makes you want to applaud the writing and the directing. The cinematography and the use of music are very well done that it creates more vibrancy. 'Inglourious Basterds' is not an easy movie to watch for everyone, it will definitely put people off for its use of sheer violence, but I urge you to watch this movie with open mind in order to be entertained and to be fascinated by a Wonderful director such as 'Quentine Tarantino'.",10,2,9,23 August 2009
No Country for Old Men," A great thriller and a subtle character study.
","'No country for old men' is one of the best thrillers that I've seen in years. This is the first movie of the Coen brothers that I came upon and there's no doubt that I'll reach out for more. Their innovative writing and masterful story telling techniques has made quite an impression on me to check out their much earlier films.The story follows a poor farmer (played wonderfully by Josh Brolin) who came across a suitcase of money in a drug deal gone wrong and his struggle to steer his life away from the villainous Anton Chigur. A man with a terrifying smile, who travels across Texas, carrying a cattle gun, destroying anything that would cause him any inconvenience when it comes to acquiring the briefcase. It is hard to even imagine such a man could exist, but then again its not. This may sound as quite a simple story but then again the great masters such as Ozu and Bresson used simple stories to create innovative work. It is through their simplicity that they evoked such powerful emotions in the characters as well as in the audience. Here the Coen brothers follow the same route. It is flawlessly shot to the point that it's suspense would without a doubt hold you at the edge of the seat. The photography of the stark beautiful western landscape and creative writing are two more aspects of the film that deserves much admiration.",10,4,7,15 August 2009
Grave of the Fireflies," A powerful experience..
","Grave of the fireflies is a fascinating animated story revealing the horrors of war. It is a movie so powerful that it is hard not to get emotionally choked up at the end of the movie (speaking through experience). It tells the story of a teenage boy along with his five year old sister made homeless by the bombings during the World War. They become separated from their mother during an air raid only to find out her dead a few moments later. Their father is a naval officer serving for the country in hostile waters. With no other place to go Setsuko (5 year old girl) under the loving care of her brother Seita, settles in their aunt's house. As time passes their aunt complains about Seita not doing anything to earn food, and starts treating them cruelly. Eventually the two siblings find themselves a cave to reside despite its poor conditions. Here he does whatever he can to feed himself and his sister, while acting as a father figure to her. This desperation to live; fabulously brought to screen will move you beyond anything imaginable. One of the greatest gifts this film has is its ability to show the emotionally draining scenes in an effective manner. We first get to see the playful, cute and cuddly Sestuko having fun only to see her lying helplessly due to starvation. I shouldn't write further for it might spoil the surprises. No other movie has moved me so deeply than 'Grave of the fireflies'. It is a masterful creation to be watched, dissected and most importantly to be learned from.",10,2,3,29 January 2009
Three Colors: Blue," Blue=Liberty or is it?
","Krzysztof Kieslowski's Blue is the first of the three part trilogy based on the three colors of the French flag, with the other two being Red and White. It follows a story of a woman;Julie, played by Juliet Binoche dealing with the pain and her life after the accidental death of her husband and her daughter. She is completely cut off from everyone else around her life, and she decides to deal with the pain on her own terms. After her loss, she destroys all music notes composed by her husband and sells anything in her house that would bring her memories from the past. She is sad and shaken. She tests her self whether she could feel any love by seducing the man who was working with her husband who was secretly in love with her. No she cannot. She settles into an apartment by herself to be free, to begin life all over again or to just avoid the urge to begin. Krzysztof Kieslowski, who was one of the most prolific filmmakers, was a devotee of such filmmakers as Bergman and Tarkovsky, who explored subjects of faith, philosophy and death. Kieslowski here too dives into these subjects in a fashionable way, playing around with some of the scenes to show the inner nature of the characters using beautiful cinematography and story telling techniques. The use of close ups in the movie has a profound effect in portraying the mindset of a character. We read their faces to understand what it says even though the words are not present to express it. Towards the end there is quite a surprise when she meets the mistress of her dead husband who is now pregnant with his child. How they deal with this discovery and most importantly how Julie deals with it presents a great revelation about her.",9,2,2,4 December 2009
Carrie," A Chilling and spellbinding horror movie from a master of suspense.
","Brian De Palma's Carrie is a unique gem in the genre of horror, made with love to offer a great piece of entertainment. De Palma who is without a doubt has been influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, often uses the great master's edgy mysteriousness mixed with humor to create a masterful character study. Carrie, the young protagonist is a pale faced teenage girl who is shy, quite, strange, weird and anything else that one could describe as a trait of an outsider. She is a sad result of extreme religious oppression, forced onto her by her overtly religious mother. A walking ghost, she wears the same generic clothes with no sense of style, wanders alone in school and hardly ever communicates with people. She is in a mental prison created by her mother, for she is not allowed to go to the prom, talk with strangers or experience the bliss that a young teenage girl meant to. This confinement causes her to tread more dangerous territories. She has a mysterious ability to control objects around her with her thoughts, and the inescapable abuse and hate she suffers causes her to use these powers with devastating results. De Palma, who went on to make a slew of classics after Carrie, is seen experimenting with the trademark visual styles that would propel him to the forefront of great directors. The opening credits sequence which is a slow motion shot of the girl's locker room is hypnotic and at the same time shocking for it's eroticism that makes one think that anything could happen in the movie. The director has an uncanny ability to manipulate images to create a certain emotional depth in the characters, simultaneously building surprise and suspense. The acting in Carrie is another if not the best aspect to appreciate in this movie. Most actors who are making their debut appearances are quite effective. Carrie played by Sissy Spacek, looks as if she had almost worked herself into a state of trance during the climatic scenes, making her portrayal of Carrie more shocking and real. Carrie's mother played flawlessly by Piper Laurie brings humor and craziness to her character. John Travolta, Nancy Allen and the rest of the supporting cast adds vibrancy that makes the movie flow according to its agenda. Carrie is an entertaining horror movie wonderfully made to give the audience the shock of their lives. It avoids all clichés of the horror movies of today which are nothing but gruesome portrayals of human torture. This very reason is why Carrie is filled with humanity, humor, suspense and surprise for it intelligently avoids letting the Butcher make the film.",9,1,1,22 August 2009
Trainspotting," A fine portrayal of the lifestyles of drug addicts and its consequences.
","Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting' is a brave attempt on showing the destructive lifestyles that drug addicts lead and its disturbing consequences on both them and society. What makes this movie different is its fashionable way of unfolding itself which really deviates from conventional film-making. Instead of looking from a viewpoint of a non-addict, it taps into the head of a drug addict and shows the audience the bizarre world of such individual. The disturbing images blended with psychedelic music create such a world effortlessly. The movie which is based upon a popular novel by Irvin Welsh is a about a group of drug addicts played energetically by a gifted cast. 'Renton' played by Ewan McGregor can be identified as the protagonist, who narrates the story and someone who will have no problem in diving down a filthy toilet in order to recover lost drugs. His fellow drug addicts include 'Spud' who is seeing as the ideal naive bloke who 'hurts nobody' but screws everything up; 'Sick Boy' who brags about theories and philosophies of life, but never follows them; 'Tommy' who was a newbie for the whole drug routine finds himself taking drugs too many and finally 'Begbie' who doesn't use drugs but is a screw up who bubbles with rage and cause havoc wherever he goes. They do drugs in an old warehouse, sleep wherever they can and then come up with ways to find money (preferably robbing, which is their only option) to score the next hit of drugs in order to cease the impending effects of heroine. Funnily enough, they even consider quitting and to find them doing even more drugs all over again. This movie is well made with memorable scenes, but it is not without its flaws. It sometimes gets caught up in the situation of dragging itself too much without engaging in something new. However this is not to say that it is dull or dreary, far from it, it is filled with memorable dialogues and performances which makes this a refreshing mind bender to any movie goer.",8,1,1,21 January 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," A breathtaking and visually stunning movie.
","I must admit that I was a little skeptical in viewing this movie due to the mass hype generated throughout the internet of 'Slumdog' as a feel good movie. To my knowledge there are lot of filmmakers who use emotions as a gimmick to make audiences embrace a movie despite of major flaws in other aspects of the movie. However it was not the case with Danny Boyle's brilliantly made film. From the very start to the end, I knew I was witnessing a phenomenon of a movie. Based on an acclaimed novel, this movie engages with the audience and keeps them guessing at every moment. Lively and energetic performances ranging from the much younger actors to Dev Patel and Freida Pinto keep this movie running without dying down. The cinematography mixed with great locations and music (composed by A.R Rahman) makes this an unforgettable screen gem of our time. WATCH this movie, in fact watch it TWICE, for you won't be disappointed. BEWARE of naysayers.",10,1,3,18 January 2009
