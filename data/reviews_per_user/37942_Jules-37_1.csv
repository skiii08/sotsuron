The Blair Witch Project," Best website of the year. Worst movie of the year
","First off Im not a special effects person who likes all the big budget stuff.  Im a story and charactor person.  I love good stories with good charactors this movie had none of this.  The acting was horrible with all the over acting and 'Im so sorry' scene made me want leave the theater it was so bad.  The story wasnt to bad but it didnt go anywere.  It seems like the movie shouldnt of ended there,  it had no resolution,  maybe the sequal and prequal will take care of this.  As for the scare factor well there was none,  there was nothing to be affraid of, stones,  stick men and a guy standing in a corner, Not scary.  I know what your thinking,  I have no imagination but I do.  Im a drama and and an art student and like to think of myself to have a very good imagination. The website scared me I must admit.  Thats the reason I wanted to see the movie.  It had so much cool stuff that they could of had in the movie but none of it was there.  In closing if you liked this movie its because the mass media told you to and if you dont like this movie good for you.  If you want to see a scary movie see The Shining or The Origional Night of the Living Dead. If you want to see an un origional,  bad acted, bad story peice of shaky stock footage see The Blair Witch Project.If you disagree with this Review feel free to e-mail me~Jesse~",Null,0,1,4 February 2000
