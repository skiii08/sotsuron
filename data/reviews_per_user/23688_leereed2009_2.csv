The Blair Witch Project," What's all the HUB-BUB?!
","This movie didn't even deserve the 1/10 I rated it, but 1 is as low of rating that IMDb allows. This movie is claimed to be terrifying and I heard that some people said they couldn't even sleep the night after. This movie was ridiculously not scary and deserves all the mocking it can get. In my opinion, one person liked it and all their friends just agreed. Then this trend just went on, until almost everyone declares it to be horrifyingly frightening. Those of us with IQ's over 55, know that this movie was a waste of time and although the idea of being lost in the woods is terrifying, you don't get credit for a pursuing the death of some teenagers. This movie was humiliating to everyone whoever saw it, and we are all now dumber for watching it. Thanks losers!",1,2,3,21 May 2008

","Way overrated! That is all I can say about this movie. As a huge fan of Will Smith, I was very disappointed. Expecting to go to the theater and see a movie that the critics call 'mind-blowing', instead I was given a mediocre film who's story line has been done before, but in different ways. It had an overtone of depression and sadness. The only brilliance of this movie is the acting of Will Smith and his slow slip into the cabin fever madness, which there was not even very much of. This movie pulled in millions upon millions, only due to the fact that Will Smith has reached 'A' list level stardom and people assume that almost anything he makes is good. I was very disappointed and I give this a 4/10.",4,2,2,5 April 2008
