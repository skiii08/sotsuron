Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Very disappointing
","The Star Wars movies have always been some of my favorites.  I find them very exciting, and the plot just seems to take me away, and makes me feel like I'm almost a character in the movie.  Episode I, on the otherhand, could just not keep my attention.  I actually (I swear to you I'm not making this up, lol) fell ASLEEP and missed the last half hour, so I had to pay another five bucks to see the whole thing again the last week, and found it even more boring then.  This is only the second time in my life that I've fallen asleep at a movie theatre.  The other time was when I was three, during some Disney movie.  Some people are saying 'this was just meant to introduce the characters..yadda yadda yadda'.  You don't spent two hours just introducing characters!  I wouldn't say this movie was the worst of all time, considering that a lot of people seem to really like it (though I don't know how).  I really hope Episode II is better.",Null,0,1,5 November 2001
