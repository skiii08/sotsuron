Lucky Number Slevin," Koreans got Oldboy, we got Lucky Number Slevin!
","Well the first half of this movie reminded me of Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' and I repeat again, only the first half. Then this film transforms into something different. Josh Hartnett stars as Slevin who is mistaken for someone else by two rival gangs. Obviously he is unable to prove who he really is and he has to find a way to get out of this mess. But just when you think you know it all the story suddenly takes another turn when a mysterious assassin (Willis) arrives. I just would like to say that Lucy Liu is so sweet in this movie.I just would like to say the less you know about this movie the better it is.",7,0,0,28 June 2009
A Walk to Remember," Emotionally exploitive? Yes, but that doesn't hurt
","This is a perfect movie to watch with your date/girlfriend/wife when alone. It basically retells the story of two opposites falling in love with each other. So even though this has been done to death what makes this so good? Simple - the chemistry between the two main characters is amazing and very believable. Add to that the fact that this takes place in a small town and all the characters being likable.There are several other romantic movies released in the previous decade that had better acting and original stories (Before Sunrise, The Notebook, Amelie). But I would include this movie along with them in my Top 10 Romance Movies of the Noughties.Once again, take my advice and watch this movie with your better half. Believe me, you would not regret it.",9,0,0,5 June 2013
