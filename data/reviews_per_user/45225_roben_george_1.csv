The Expendables 2," My verdict on The expendables 2
",i loved the movie because it had the best cast of action stars and lot of action.It was better than the expendables(2010). There are no twist or suspense in the movie just hardcore actions.The first 15 min of the movie is simply awesome.The performance of Stallone and Van Dam me is great.All other did their part well especially Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris.Liam Hems worth played his part well.The movie had less explosions comparing with Expendables(2010). The movie had such big cast all the actors did their roles well. During the climax there is a fight between Stallone and Van Dam-me which is good.So must watch movie for action movie fans.We can definitely expect a third installment of The expendables.......,8,3,6,29 August 2012
