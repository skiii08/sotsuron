The King's Speech," Manipulative Feel-Good Movie
","If Hollywood ever decides to bring the Hays Code back from the bad days of self-censorship, they'll use this movie as an example that castrated filmmakers can still make 'great cinema'.Colin Firth plays Bertie, also known as Albert and the Duke of York, the heir to the British throne. Bertie has a stammer and needs help to overcome this impediment because he needs to speak in public a lot. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), hooks him up with Lionel Logue, a failed Australian actor (the total opposite of the brilliant Geoffrey Rush), who's good at helping people with speech impediments. His assistance proves essential when Bertie becomes King George VI during World War II and has to deliver a worldwide war speech. Lionel coaches him and Bertie delivers it without problems. I'm not ruining the movie by spelling out the ending in the second paragraph, am I? It's not like the 'inspiring true story' bit from the trailer refers to Bertie's total and utter failure to deliver his wartime speech. That wouldn't be very inspiring, would it? 'True story' in recent times has become a code for predictable movies about insignificant historical figures involved in unmemorable events. These movies usually contain an uplifting ending, and if the reality isn't uplifting enough, they'll correct that in the screenplay. Yes, the good old days when only really remarkable people like Lawrence of Arabia and Gandhi graced the silver screen are gone. All hail the rejects who aren't even good enough for footnotes in an eccentric history guide to obscure historical figures.The movie, of course, works hard at selling the idea that Bertie is amazing, the one and only who could steer his country during the war. Although he's just a king he's so awesome he could double as the Messiah. Contrast is one of the best tools used in screen writing to flesh out character. So who is Bertie contrasted against? His father, King George V (Michael Gambon), who comes across as a jerk who looks down on the commoners; and his brother, King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), another jerk who fires eighty servants and buys expensive jewellery to his wife. Bertie is appalled. Bertie would never do that! No? He probably did too, but let's not dwell on it. It's important to sell the image that a strong leader is always morally irreprehensible. We don't want the masses to start doubting institutionalised authority.The Hays Code is very much alive.And what about the friendship between Bertie and a commoner like Lionel? This movie after all is about their friendship. The movie even ends with the crucial information that Bertie and Lionel remained friends until their deaths. Who wouldn't want to serve under this King? He even treats the little people like real human beings. In the sinister agenda of social control at the core of this movie it's important to reiterate that our leaders are just like us. Sure, they're rich and free to be irresponsible but deep down they're just like us.The movie goes to great lengths to show just how ordinary the aristocrats are. Although under the Hays Code they can't show sex, they can nevertheless show something just as familiar and enjoyable to the masses: toilet jokes. Consider the first meeting between Elizabeth and Lionel. She enters his office and what do we hear? A toilet flushing! And look how embarrassed she looks. What a clever way to break the ice! And then when Bertie comes in they do it again! In a movie by Adam Sandler people would call this puerile. But in the best movie of the year it's a scene of superb cerebral wit. It must be that British touch; everything's funnier when it's British. Even better is the scene when Lionel's wife meets the new royal couple. Look how awed she is. Isn't that just what all of us mortals aspire to? Hanging out with the famous? And in this fashion the movie progresses to its uplifting conclusion, at points stopping to generate fake conflict because, although we all know where the movie is going, it's important to give the illusion the movie is suspenseful. I know I lost count of the times Bertie furiously quit the treatment with Lionel only to come back. But nothing beats the scene when the Archbishop of Canterbury (Derek Jacobi) reveals that Lionel doesn't really have a diploma in speech therapy! Now let's stop and think. At this point in the movie Bertie is about to be crowned king. He's been with Lionel for considerable time already. He's improved; he's witnessed the effectiveness of Lionel's methods. But they needed an antagonist, and the Archbishop wasn't doing much in the movie, so why not, let's turn him into a villain for three minutes. Well, that crisis solved, the movie continues until the next time Bertie throws a tantrum at Lionel or whatever. This is writing that at best can only be described as garbage. David Seidler is going to win an Oscar over the much superior Mike Leigh. Think about that. Right now even Christopher Nolan's screenplay full of underdeveloped characters and expository dialogue is looking positively Shakespearean.Firth and Rush are very good. Bonham Carter is adequate in an undemanding role. The rest is execrable. Alexandre Desplat's score can't hold its ground every time classical music plays. The movie is visually dull. Hooper never gives his camera anything interesting to do or to film.Fans of simple messages who need to have restored their faith in perfect leaders and who believe that this world is the best of possible worlds and that hard work conquers everything, if you occasionally watch movies that weren't made seventy years ago, a mediocre director called Tom Hooper has just made the movie of your dreams.",5,19,36,24 February 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Ode to Superficiality vol. 2
","Kill Bill vol. 2 is the uninteresting continuation of the uninteresting Kill Bill.Although the characters continue to live their paper-thin existences, and the dialogue continues to be more cool than interesting, the viewer has the pleasure of finally enjoying David Carradine's performance as Bill, the only actual interesting character in this two-volume epic of superficiality.Although his role is short, Bill is one of those characters that suggests an entire life outside the action we're watching on the screen, and I couldn't help wishing I saw more about his life than The Bride's repetitive revenge.Otherwise, the movie offers nothing new. I will give Tarantino credit, however, for having introduced me to some new Ennio Morricone scores. Since this man can't even be bothered to hire composers to compose original scores, he may as well steal the best music around, and no one is better than Morricone. During the movie I was more excited whenever I heard a new track by Morricone than anything I actually saw.So for widening my musical horizons a bit more, and for giving me Bill at last, I rate this movie slightly above the first volume. But it's still an uninteresting piece of cinema.",6,0,2,9 September 2009
Vertigo," Hitchcock's Study of Madness and Obsession
","In my first viewing of Vertigo, the movie let me down. It wasn't until I watched it again that I began rejoicing in its beauty and artistic quality, and even if today it's not one of my favorite movies, at least I've grown to respect it.James Stewart plays Scottie, a San Francisco detective hired by an old friend to watch his wife, Madeleine: the husband thinks she's suffering from a mental disease in which she imagines herself being possessed by the spirit of a woman who killed herself. Scottie investigates her and eventually falls in love with her; he tries to help her overcome her belief that a spirit is possessing her, but in the end she kills herself just like the other woman.The first part of the movie is a tense thriller, but it's the second part that really makes the movie the masterpiece it is. In it we discover how far a man will go to recover the love of a dead woman. Necrophilia, although the word is never used in this movie, is never too distant.Stewart is amazing in the movie. The movie was a commercial failure and Hitchcock blamed it on Stewart's age, but for me the frail, slightly bumbling personality that he gave Scottie makes him one of the most interesting detectives in the history of cinema. And when he lets out all the darkness in his soul in the second part of the movie, then he reaches new heights of perversion.But Kim Novak also deserves recognition for her performance, in which she must display several personalities over multiple roles.This movie is not as exciting as Hitchcock's The Birds or North By Northwest: these are exciting movies that never stop; North By Northwest is a chase movie so it's always in motion; and The Birds has an atmosphere of dread that keeps the viewer on the edge even not much is happening. But Vertigo is Hitchcock doing a character study about obsession, love, insanity and jealousy.The first sequence in the movie, a chase scene on rooftops, is followed by slower, but tense, scenes of detective work in which time slows down so the viewer can appreciate Scottie's mind at work as he puts the evidence together in Madeleine's mysterious case. Little by little the movie picks up its pace until the becomes a roller-coaster of tension by the end.Two things stood out for me in the movie: the cinematography in its use of colors, especially green; we see it in all the key moments, whether in the trees, in Madeleine's costume or in neon lights. Also, the use of depth to portray Scottie's fear of heights - hence the vertigo of the title - was very imaginative.And secondly, one cannot disregard Bernard Hermann's tragic score for the movie. Built on the music for Tristan and Isolde, Herrmann's score is perfect for a movie about doomed love: it's melancholy and dreamy. The movie wouldn't have been the same without the score's tone of tragedy it brought to it.",8,3,8,17 February 2010
Black Swan," Derivative, Clichéd Psychodrama about Tortured Artist
","Repulsion. Suspiria. Shine. The Piano Teacher. These were four movies Black Swan made me think of without effort. Others have brought up Persona and Mulholland Drive. They work too. It doesn't really matter which movies people bring up in connection with Darren Aronofsky's movie, the bottom line is: they're all likely to be superior than this derivative mess. Imagine if Brion Gysin instead of cutting up newspapers to compose poems, cut up famous films to make a new one. We'd call it Brion Gysin's Black Swan.Natalie Portman plays Nina, a repressed ballet dancer with low self esteem who's dominated by her mother (Barbara Hershey), a former dancer who gave up her career to have Nina and who experiences glory through her daughter's success. And success arrives when Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), Nina's company director, offers her the roles of the White Swan/Black Swan in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. But Nina, the meek, virginal damsel, will have to get in touch with her dark side in order to play the role of the sensual, dangerous Black Swan. Will she manage it or will the pressure drive her crazy? This is a rhetorical question, by the way. There's really no suspense here: Nina is a basket case from the start. As soon as the movie starts she's already lost in hallucinations.There's also no explanation why Thomas, who's never seen Nina display a dark side, thinks she can play the dual role. It must be faith. Of course to help her he sort of sexually harasses her, taunts her in front of others and even suggests she masturbate to 'live a little.' Cassel, a provocative devil to the angelic Portman, is a delight to watch and delivers arguably the only good performance in the movie – sexy, bullying and arrogant; he'll destroy Nina's self if that will get a great performance out of her.The rest of the cast isn't up to much: Hershey and Winona Ryder, who plays an aging dancer forced into retirement so Nina can have her role, deliver efficient performances considering the weak material they got. Portman, desperate to prove her thespian talents, oscillates between hysteria and mediocrity. Watching her I didn't have the impression I was watching a tour de force but a little girl pretending to be an excellent actress playing a poorly-written character who's supposed to be a complex and tormented ballet dancer.The movie makes a big deal about how Nina's dancing style must change to suit the Black Swan. It's seductive, looser and more uncontrolled. We're supposed to think that when she finally plays the Black Swan it'll be a transcendental moment – somehow she will marvel us with the perfection of her performance, a perfection she achieves at a very hard price and with much sacrifice. But it's exactly the way Nina plays every time in the movie. The audience claps fiercely, Thomas congratulates her, but nothing has changed.The cast, which isn't very remarkable, fails to salvage the script, which is awful. Is the movie at least technically good? I'm on the fence. The cinematography and editing are efficient. Aronofsky brings in interesting horror aesthetics too. I love all the tricks of the trade he employs to show Nina's madness: mirror reflections moving independently, her face projected on others, talking drawings. From David Lynch he lifts spooky sound effects that underscore tension and the fragmentation of reality.When the movie focuses on Nina's madness it's quite good actually. Her sense of persecution is quite believable, especially when she suspects that Lily (Mila Kunis), is trying to steal the lead role from her. Kunis doesn't do much either, but it's fascinating that the perception of her as an antagonist is not supported by anything she does but only by what goes on in Nina's mind.Sadly the movie also uses visual effects that cheesy B horror movies would only use at gunpoint. The scene of Nina turning into a black swan in the movie's climax looks distractingly fake in a way that a Cronenberg or Carpenter movie 30 years ago, with less money, wouldn't have.Then there's the simplistic colour scheme – Nina wears white because she's good and innocent; Lily wears black and if that's not obvious enough she has black wings tattooed on her back. When Nina starts going dark, she starts wearing dark. Perhaps Aronofsky thought the hearing impaired in the audience couldn't get the colour/concept association right from the countless times the screenplay spelled it out loud, so here's some nice visual support.Black Swan is as unbalanced as Nina's sanity – a poorly-written movie taking itself more seriously than its foundations on pop psychology, clichés about tormented geniuses and melodramas permit it. The result is over-the-top kitsch. Nothing stands out except Tchaikovsky's music, which, in comparison to the one by Clint Mansell, the fraud of frauds of film music, shows how low the standards in film music have fallen. A few composers could give Tchaikovsky a run for his money: Ennio Morricone, Georges Delerue, the recently deceased John Barry, but not Mansell. Here he seems satisfied with the tracks Angelo Badalamenti must have decided not to use in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. This is what the whole movie looks like: leftovers from other movies, half-good ideas, untapped potential. It aims at the magnificence of Swan Lake but it soars only to fall to its death like Icarus.",5,14,23,10 February 2011
In Bruges," Hit men With Consciousness
","Two hit men travel to Bruges after a botched hit. Ken, the older, more mature hit-man, sees this as an opportunity to visit the beautiful Medieval city and all its cultural artifacts. Ray, the young hit-man, is going crazy and can't wait to get back to the 'real world'. But they can't movie until they get a call from their boss, the mysterious Harry.This simple premise provides Martin McDonagh the room to create a blend of comedy and drama involving a drug-taking dwarf, obnoxious turists, a neo-Nazi and his girlfriend who rob turists, prostitutes, Bosch imagery and the beautiful city of Bruges. Through all the dark humor emerges a captivating movie about the importance of principles, the ability to change, sacrifice, regret and responsibility. Quite a tall order for a hit-man movie, but McDonagh pulls it off with delicacy and excitement.I don't remember a dull moment in the movie, one that didn't have something to hold the viewer's attention, whether it be the witty dialogue, the slapstick humor, or just the shots of Bruges.Much of the film's quality comes from its Oscar-nominated screenplay. But the three main characters each contributed a good deal to the wonder. Colin Farrell reveals some talent for humor and even drama, when need be. Ralph Fiennes continues to reward viewers with his intense performances. But the real star, the actor who should have won the Oscar for best supporting role last year but wasn't even nominated, was Brendan Gleeson. I haven't seen him in such a complex and promising role since The General. And it's obvious the role excited him because he gave one of his best performances ever, playing a middle-aged hit-man fed up with death trying to do some good for people at last, even if it costs him life.I gave this movie the pass when it came out, and much regret it has caused me after watching it on DVD. There can never be enough movies like this.",8,1,3,8 September 2009
Chinatown," The Most Perfect Movie Ever Made
","Chinatown is one of the few movies I consider perfect. I've seen it several times and when I start thinking about it, dismantling the several aspects that constitute it, I don't find anything wrong about it. Perhaps only Lawrence of Arabia has such an equal perfect synthesis of acting, writing, cinematography, editing, story, pacing, music and atmosphere.The movie starts with private investigator J. J. Gittes following a man named Mulwray, whose wife thinks is cheating on her. Gittes takes photos and they make their way into a newspaper. Gittes unknowingly became a pawn in a smear campaign. Furthermore, he discovers that Mulwray's real wife, Evelyn, wasn't the person that hired him. And then Mulwray shows up dead.Chinatown is a movie that simultaneously draws inspiration from the source of film noir and changes this genre. It is not a coincidence that John Huston, the director considered the father of film noir (The Maltese Falcon), plays a supporting role here. Roman Polanski knows his film history and knows how to give credit where credit is due. But Huston was also a good actor so his role here is more than deserved, indeed I could not conceive this movie without his performance: he plays an odious, disgusting, unrepentant bastard with such conviction it's difficult to see where the performance ends and the person begins.And then we have Faye Dunaway, playing one of the greatest femme fatales in history. She's a mix of untouchable angel and demonic temptress; she displays a cold reservation about the people around her, a misleading fragility that hides a dangerous mind. Although I've never liked Dunaway much, I think no one has come close to portraying hopeless despair and dread as she does in this movie.But Chinatown also modernises the genre. Not that film noir was ever bad, but the conception of realism is something that changes with time, and what was realistic in Out of the Past or The Maltese Falcon seems unconvincing nowadays. The tough Sam Spade gives way to J.J. Gittes, a down-to-earth private eye who worries if his involvement with murder suspects and his tinkering with evidence won't make him lose his license; and who wears a bandage in his face almost the entire movie after a knife cut. This frailty, this concern with mundane details was unthinkable in noir before Jack Nicholson. The '70s have my favourite performances by Nicholson – One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; the movie he made with Antonionni, Professione: Reporter; The Last Detail – and my absolutely favourite is his role as Gittes, an otherwise good-intentioned detective who gets involved in something that's too much for someone as insignificant as him to handle. For although he's the hero of the movie, he's that modern type of hero that achieves nothing.Chinatown is a movie where nobility and heroism meet a dead end. Fatalism, that other gift from classic noir, is much present here. Gittes is a man trying to do good in a world that has no conception of goodness anymore, and he only makes things worse, little by little, until the unforgettable (foretold) ending where everything is tied up. Few movie endings carry such a punch as Chinatown, but it's the only ending suitable.Roman Polanski and Robert Towne, the original screenwriter, deserve all the praise in the world for having created this masterpiece. So do the three main actors. And on a final note, Jerry Goldsmith also deserves recognition for his beautiful score, so beautiful and delicate in its melancholy, that it feels like the movie translated into musical notes. They all deserve to be forever remembered for one of cinema's masterworks.",10,12,23,14 February 2010
Inglourious Basterds," A WWII Fairy-Tale
","Inglourious Basterds is my favorite movie of 2009 so far. I never imagined I'd praise a Quentin Tarantino again, since I've only enjoyed Jackie Brown. But this extravagant WWII fairy-tale got hold of my attention from the first moment and din't let me go until the final deranged shot.Marketing promoted this movie as nothing more than American soldiers infiltrating enemy lines to spread terror amongst Nazis. As amusing as that could have been for the first ten minutes, it could never sustain a 150-minute-long movie. Fortunately Tarantino was at his most inspired here and developed a parallel subplot about a Jewish girl seeking revenge against the Nazis. And the fun becomes watching these two stories converge until the explosive finale.From a technical perspective, I think Tarantino's crew did a great work with the cinematography and editing and with bringing the 1940s to life (Tarantino even had everyone talking their original languages). This movie is a pleasure to watch just for the way each scene is shot.But it's the actors and the characters they give life to that really stand out. There are so many bigger-than-life characters here I don't know where to start. Perhaps with the one that's making everyone talk: Colonel Hans Landa, a sinister, charming, erudite, silly SS officer played by Christoph Waltz. He steals the show with the range of expressions and behavior his role demands: he can go from polite to homicidal in seconds. He speaks four languages fluently in the movie. His interrogation scenes are unforgettable and so is his coolness. A new villain is born.Mélanie Laurent portrays Shoshanna, a Jewish girl whose family was killed by Landa. Years later she has a chance to kill him and a theater full of Nazis in one of the most satisfying revenge plans cinema has concocted in a long time. Laurent, who for me is the main character of the movie (no matter what marketing says about Brad Pitt), portrays her character as a reserved but implacable woman in her pursuit of revenge. And if anyone gives Waltz the run of his money in this movie, that's Laurent.The rest of the roles are small but memorable. My third favorite would be Diane Kruger's. Knowing her only from Troy, one would think she's nothing more than a pretty but lifeless face. But when working with good material, she can lit up a scene. Her short role as Bridget Von Hammersmark, a German actress working for the Allied Forces, allows her to play a seductive, deceptive, restrained and deadly woman.Brad Pitt and everyone else who plays his Basterds are hilarious, but they hardly ever steal the show as these three actors do. I think Tarantino just put them there to draw unsuspecting American viewers into watching a movie that's not really about American soldiers.I must write a few lines about the music. Sadly this wasn't yet the time Tarantino and Morricone collaborated on a movie. Still the director almost makes up for it by filling the movie with Morricone tracks. It's great to know that music Morricone made forty, thirty years ago is still more explosive and epic than the music being made nowadays. Aurally speaking, Inglourious Basterds does sound like the Spaghetti Western Tarantino wanted to make.Inglourious Basterds is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. For me it's a true cinematic experience because it's not something I could get in any other artistic medium. This isn't a bestseller or video game or comic book adaptation; it's not a 'true story' full of distortions; in fact the last minutes will prove it's anything but built on history. Tarantino doesn't give a damn about realism. This is fiction at its most uncompromising best, and arguably a fine piece of film art. Cinema needs more movies like this.",10,3,11,28 August 2009
12 Monkeys," Intelligent & Creative Science Fiction Movie: Gilliam's Best Yet!
","Terry Gilliam's and David Peoples' teamed up to create one of the most intelligent and creative science fiction movies of the '90's. People's proved a screenplay with bizarre twists and fantastic ideas about the nature of time  I especially love the idea one can't change the past; it's a nice counterpoint to so many time-travelling movies which say otherwise  biological holocausts and the thin line between sanity and madness. Gilliam visualized his ideas with unique quirkiness, perfection and originality.The story itself is engaging: one man, James Cole (played by Bruce Willis in a heart-warming performance) travels several decades to the past to retrieve information about a virus that's wiped out mankind and left only a few survivors alive living underground: with the information he'll collect, scientists hope to find a cure so everyone in the future can return to the surface. But because their time-travelling technology isn't perfect, he ends up being sent towards different other pasts and complicating things. And from that a brilliant science fiction thriller with shades of film noir ensues as the multiple pieces of a huge jigsaw start fitting together to form a bizarre narrative involving animal right activists, end of the millennium paranoia, biological weapons, the perception of reality, and the definition of sanity. With such a complex movie, it was easy for Gilliam and Peoples to create a mess, but instead Twelve Monkeys is a thought-provoking narrative which will please those who like to be challenged and have patience to appreciate some crazy ideas.I watched this movie once around 10 years ago. It marked me a lot: I remember still thinking about many days after-wards; for my young mind this seemed quite mind-blowing and it was one of the first movies to make me appreciate cinema as something serious and important. I've re-watched this movie a few days ago on DVD and it's better than I remembered it. Brad Pitt still steals all the scenes he's in, playing Jeffrey Goines  almost a prelude to his Tyler Durden character in Fight Club  a rich kid with some anarchist/non-conformist ideas who's also crazy and, according to Cole, perhaps responsible for the virus. The scenes between Jeffrey and Cole in the madhouse are the best in the movie, Pitt's eyes, voice and quirky mannerisms convince you he's really a crazy guy locked in a warped logic only he understands. Pitt's Oscar nomination was well deserved! Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up. Cole is a rather ambiguous character, Peoples' tried to imbue some darkness in him, and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself: the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked. Ironically Cole didn't start as a crazy character, but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world, he's considered mad and convinced it's all in his mind, until he arrives at a point when he can't distinguish past from future, reality from fiction. Willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure, and it works perfectly. One of the fun twists in the narrative is when Cole's shrink, Dr. Kathryn Railly, finds undeniable proof he's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world. The screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace. Their relationship is also well-handed, although perhaps a bit compressed for time's sake. But I enjoyed watching Cole and Railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past. But then things end in a tragic/bittersweet climax at an airport, wrapping all the pieces together, which will blow many minds away.There are two great endings in this movie, a twist in the sense of Se7en or Fight Club, and a more intimate ending where Railly is crouching next to Cole who's just been shot and looking around for a younger James Cole who's witnessing his future self die; the two share a brief look, and she smiles at him. The twist is brilliant, but I prefer this ending for emotional impact. Madeleine Stowe is very good playing Dr. Railly, she drew many different emotions from me in her performance. The movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past can't be changed: this movie shows that in a terrifying way. It reminds me of Chinatown in that sense, the way Jake Gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help. Railly's character shares that fatalism, the more she tries to help Cole  first dealing with his 'madness' then helping him in his mission  the more they're sucked into tragedy.The twist ends with a hopeful note, though, with the feeling Cole's mission hasn't been in vain. Twelve Monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained; it's not supposed to be art, although it's more artists than many artistic movies. It's an unpretentious movie where all elements, from music to editing to costume design, etc., came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece.",10,19,24,20 February 2005
The Secret in Their Eyes," Disappointing Crime Drama
","The Secret of Her Eyes fell under my radar after watching the Oscar nominations for 2009. I had watched A Prophet and The White Ribbon and I was interested in seeing how this rather unknown movie competed with these two masterworks.Juan José Campanella's movie follows Benjamín Esposito's investigation of the rape and murder of a 23-year-old schoolteacher. It's a case that haunts him for decades and comes to define his existence. The movie is temporally fragmented, so the narrative jumps from past to present constantly. I should commend the makeup department for its ability to portray the ageing of actors Ricardo Darín, Soledad Villamil, Pablo Rago and Javier Godino. Without good makeup, this movie would have fallen apart quickly.Esposito's investigation takes many turns, meets opposition several times, comes to halts several times in the course of his life, ruins his personal life, and seems like it will never be solved. At the age of retirement he begins reminiscing about it and starts writing a novel based on the event.This movie addresses many topics at the same time: first of all, the craft of fiction, as Esposito struggles to make sense of the events in order to write his novel. But through this inner journey, the movie also discusses the importance of memory. It also explores the danger of obsession, as Esposito comes to realise that decades working on the case has only left him with a lonely, empty life.All these ruminations are disguised as a crime movie, a rather elegant one at that. The movie plays with genre a few times, the best one being that it reveals who the murderer is before the end of the first hour. By doing this the movie introduces a more interesting idea: what to do with a criminal who's politically untouchable? Is vigilantism ever justified? At times I reminded myself of Mystic River, which posed similar questions, although the stories are totally different.Ricardo Darín gives a good performance; in fact I have little to complain about the performances in the movie, but Darín stood out as the passionate, tireless investigator. Pablo Rago, who plays the victim's husband, also impressed me for his ability to portray loss so well.Since I watched this movie because of A Prophet and The White Ribbon, I have to ask myself: is it as good as those two? No, not by a long chance. The Secret of Her Eyes has quality and good ideas, but I never felt I was watching more than a good movie, whereas I consider the other two masterworks. It's worth watching, but it's hardly the masterpiece everyone is saying it is.On a final note, if this movie deserved another Oscar nomination, It should be for Federico Jusid's score, whose beauty will no doubt get him more exposure soon.",6,8,47,9 February 2010
127 Hours," Intelligent, Original, Audacious, Emotional Feel Good Movie of the Year
","In a year populated with mediocre inspiring true stories like The King's Speech and The Fighter, Danny Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy give a crash course on how to film a true story with heart which lifts up our spirits, with bloody graphic details and audacity and without manipulative sentimentality. 127 Hours is a perfect movie from the opening shot to the final note of the song 'Festival' by Sigur Ros which concludes it.Aaron Ralston (James Franco) gets away from the city for a weekend to explore the canyon in Utah. He has food, water and utensils. He's a cocky expert, he's done this before many times. So many times he even acts as a guide to two girls lost in the canyon, Kristi and Megan (Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn respectively). He knows shortcuts and cool places to visit. He's so sure of himself he doesn't even bother to inform friends or family of where he's going.Then he falls in a crevice and a boulder falls on his arm, trapping him meters below the surface in the middle of a lunar landscape barely visited by human beings. The movie chronicles his five days trapped there and his agonising escape, which involved cutting his arm with a blunt knife, climbing down a rock and walking until a family of explorers found him almost dead.So why is this predictable movie worth watching? Simple. No one makes movies like Danny Boyle, especially when he co-writes the screenplay with Simon Beaufoy, one of the finest screenwriters in the business (The Full Monty, Slumdog Millionaire).Boyle's detractors say he has an MTV style, but for me he's audacious and original in the way he plays with the camera and tries to find strange angles to shoot from. And strange angles abound in this movie. Who else would think of filming from inside Aaron's canteen to show his last drops of water entering his mouth? Who'd shoot from inside a arm to show a knife actually hitting a bone? Who would put a counter in the screen's corner showing the temperature in the cave dropping at night to show the conditions Aaron endured? And when Aaron gets trapped, who'd film, with wicked irony, an airplane flying very, very far, leaving a white trail in the air? Boyle is a madman, bless him! The camera madness starts right from the start, when the screen splits in three. This is a technique Boyle uses a lot in the movie, but the most effective use is the opening sequence. As the movie shows us Aaron preparing himself to leave his comfy apartment the split screen bombards us with images of crowds, brand names like McDonalds, traffic jams, neon lights. In one word: civilisation – everything Aaron is leaving behind. And when Aaron arrives at the canyon the cluttered split screen gives way to wide panoramic shots of dreary landscape. The contrast is amazing! Boyle continues to prove that he's a master of visual storytelling.The movie also boasts a career-defining performance by James Franco. Franco's performance crackles with joie de vivre, enthusiasm and cheerfulness. Sure we can think, Aaron is an idiot for going out there all alone without telling anyone, he's cocky as hell. But Franco gives Aaron such a humane personality that we can't help loving him.Aaron's time trapped under the boulder allows him to rethink his life. Although perseverance is an important theme in the movie, the real emotional power comes from Aaron recognising, almost too late in his life, his selfishness and the way he treats his family and friends, and realising that wanting to do everything alone got him in there. The most heartbreaking scene comes when he imagines himself in a talk show and chastises himself for not relying on people more often.But, amidst Aaron's growth, this movie puts forth a beautiful story about the power of hope. Not since The Pianist has cinema given erected such a monument to the triumph of the human spirit. The Pianist is a difficult movie, harrowing in depicting the atrocities of the Holocaust. The protagonist, the pianist Spizlman, superbly played by Adrien Brody, faces each new day of hiding in the Jewish ghetto as a challenge. Although we can't compare Aaron's experience to his, they find common ground in their refusal to give up, in their determination to live. 127 Hours starts with the song 'Never Hear Surf Music Again,' which says 'there must be some chemical that makes us different from animals.' This can only be another grim irony by Boyle. Consider. Foxes bite their own legs off to free themselves from traps. Aaron cuts his arm off. Survival prevails over everything else. Life is beautiful but it has a price that, most of us going through our ordinary lives, ignore until we meet extraordinary circumstances.Aaron's self-amputation scene is graphic and long, but the viewers who can stomach it will be rewarded with the most sublime ending of the year. 127 Hours is the feel good of the year, a movie so emotionally draining that the ending isn't just an historical fact but a psychological necessity for the viewer desperate for closure. It's a movie that intimately and tenderly pushes us towards the protagonist. Aaron's liberation isn't just the ending of a true story, Boyle and Beaufoy make this conclusion our deepest desire. If Aaron Ralston had died, they would have had to rewrite history because no ending short of Aaron freeing himself would satisfy the viewer who grows to love him, to laugh and cry with him. And there will be tears. Tears of despair and tears of joy, especially of joy. Anyone can film a true story, but not everyone can make the viewer anxiously wait for an ending everyone already knows in advance. Danny Boyle can.",10,0,4,27 February 2011
Dead Poets Society," Perfect for Anyone who Loves School, Books, Learning and Life
","Dead Poets Society is a fascinating drama about literature, friendship, growing up and pursuing independence. Its charisma lies in a great script and an unobtrusive directing which allows the cast - mostly young actors lead by the remarkable Robin Williams - to give out heartfelt performances.Professor John Keating (an obvious allusion here) returns to his school to teach his class literature. His students are normal teenagers, wrestling with the usual insecurities about love, their purpose in life and standing up to their parents for their share of independence. They think he's just another teacher, but rather than teaching great literature, he teaches them to think for themselves.In his student years, Keating had belonged to a student group called Dead Poets Society which celebrated poetry and life. Taking inspiration from this, some of his students resurrect the old group and begin discovering life for themselves.Although Robin Williams is the center of the movie, he never dominates it. His presence is felt as ideas that influence the students. But it's them that make the movie shine, as we follow their lives. It's a great collection: there's Todd (a young Ethan Hawke) who's struggling with shyness; there's Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who decides he wants to be an actor; there's the wild Charlie, or rather 'Nuwanda' (an unforgettable performance by Gale Hansen); and the love-struck Knox (Josh Charles).Another interesting idea in this movie is that no one every likes the idea of letting young people thinking for themselves. School is seen here as a place to train people for the future, not to teach them to think critically; of course if that's not thought at school, when will there be time? Keating upsets the status quo and when a tragedy occurs he's a suitable scapegoat. Not everyone appreciates new ideas and change. The denouement is one of the strongest I've seen in any movie.Dead Poets Society is a fantasy: in an ideal world, teachers would be cool and fascinating; and students would be receptive to knowledge and daring. As it is, this movie remains an alternative to our world full of conformity and tedium.",10,2,2,31 May 2009
The Prestige," A Fascinating Mystery
","Christopher Nolan's Memento didn't impress me, although I found the movie's structure interesting. Batman Begins downright disappointed me. Based on these two negative experiences I made the decision of not watching The Prestige when it came out in the theatres. I just knew I wouldn't like it.We all have mistakes we'd like to erase: The Prestige is my mistake. If I could go back in time and watch it on the big screen, I wouldn't think twice. I'd watch it twice actually! The Prestige is simply one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. I saw it on a Monday and on Tuesday I was watching it again. As labyrinthine as the plot may be, it's never hard to follow (good screen writing and editing deserve credit for this), but you will want to watch it again because it's just too damn good! The Prestige follows the rivalry between Angier and Borden, two stage magicians at the end of the 19th century, as each one struggles to come up with the ultimate magic trick. Rivalry quickly becomes obsession, and deceit, kidnapping and murder become the means they use to reach their goals. Science also plays an unexpected role in this movie, which contributes to one of its more interesting twists. Yes, plural: there are at least 4 major twists in this movie. Too much? Trust me, the Nolan brothers know what they're doing.The cast is superb: we have the always excellent Michael Caine, Christian Bale, who's enjoying a renaissance in his career, Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson. The editing and cinematography are great. I love the art direction: the art crew brings 19th London to life, recreates the magic stages of the time, and speculates on how some of Tesla's inventions would look like.But what I really love in this movie is the screenplay. It might be light on character development, but this is first and foremost a mystery movie. The Nolan brothers do everything to delay giving information and keep suspense alive for as long as possible; they use flashbacks, they use an ingenious diary-within-diary narrative, voice-overs and just a lot of intelligent, and honest, misdirection. If you don't crack the mystery on your own, you have yourself to blame; the movie puts all the answers right in front of you.Watching The Prestige is a unique cinematic experience. It's everything I want from a movie. It's renewed my interest in the Nolans again and has made me anxious about The Dark Knight. If you want to have fun, watch this movie.",10,3,5,25 February 2008
The Adventures of Tintin," It's full of adventure
","I was having a look at my shelf full of European comics (as opposed to my shelf full of American comics), and my suspicions were confirmed: I only have one Tintin album in my collection. And my memories of reading it are very sketchy. I probably enjoyed the art; I've always admired Hergé's style. The story I can't remember. Something about the young journalist never appealed to my reading tastes.So the prospects of a film adaptation never fascinated me. But I allowed myself to be dragged into the movie. Perhaps it was this lack of interest that resulted in such a fantastic experience for me.Throughout the movie I kept waiting to hear the Indiana Jones theme. That's how fast-paced and exciting the movie was. The Adventures of Tintin doesn't waste time setting up the first arc. As soon as the animated credits sequence starts we're promised adventure, mystery, dashing escapes, humour and action. And action is what we get in the form of naval battles, swordfights, feverish car chases, and much more. The movie plunges the viewer right into the story, with Tintin buying a mysterious model ship at a flea market only to be warned by a terrified man that his life is now in danger. With his curiosity roused, the intrepid journalist's investigation takes him aboard a ship where he meets Captain Haddock and Sakharine, a criminal in search of a sunken treasure.The movie is first and foremost an introduction to Captain Haddock, as well as his rehabilitation. When Tintin meets him, command of his ship has been taken away from him by a mutinous crew and the poor Captain is consoling himself with copious amounts of alcohol. We learn that Haddock descends from a long line of worthless ne'er-do-wells, with the exception of an ancestor who once loyally served the King of England and allowed a fabulous treasure sink rather than let a pirate get his hands on it. For someone who's mostly familiar with the world of Tintin through the 1990s animated series, uncovering Captain Haddock's mysterious background acted as a gripping way to reintroduce me to Tintin. I don't know what fans will think about this adaptation, but I believe the movie succeeds as a gateway to casual viewers.The motion capture animation originated many fears and has generated a lot of criticism, but I wish to assure viewers what director Steven Spielberg does with the animation surpasses Robert Zemeckis' disappointing forays into this technology. The movie is closer to Avatar than The Polar Express. The animated characters are expressive, fluid, slightly exaggerated, and always captivating. Spielberg is a filmmaker who knows how to use technology and has always been in the vanguard of new techniques, so I have no ideas how anyone could fear the animation will be anything less than stellar. The characters not only seem to be imbued with independent life, but the world Spielberg creates is full of little details and visual jokes that will keep viewers coming back for multiple sessions and, when it comes out in DVD, using the Pause button a lot. The first of such details is the affectionate cameo of Hergé in the first minutes of the movie, complete with a nod to his original artwork.I wrote I kept expecting to hear the Indiana Jones theme, but that's not just because of the similarities. Sadly this movie isn't perfect. John Williams fails to find a worthy main theme for Tintin. I don't believe anyone will come out of the theatre humming the theme he composed for the movie, let alone remember it after a couple of days. Being an avid film score collector, I made the mistake of listening to the music before watching the movie, and I found it bland. It works remarkably well in the movie, I later discovered, but it's not an iconic theme that sticks in one's memory. And that's a shame because Tintin is a hero who deserves a theme instantly recognizable as his theme, as easily as Superman is recognised by the theme Williams composed for him in 1978. I fear Williams' efforts will not dethrone the theme Ray Parker and Tom Szczesniak composed for the animated series, in the minds of fans.Is things movie going to be a success or a failure? I can't say. Motion Capture movies tend to fail at the box office, as Zemeckis can attest. And Tintin, in spite of being a mega-star across the world, is irrationally obscure in the USA, which is not yet a negligible market in this globalised world. But I urge viewers to give it a chance; if nothing else, for 107 minutes you'll be in the presence of Steven Spielberg's old magic, which nowadays is rare indeed. That was once a great selling point. I hope it can be again.And if there are any sequels planned, may they come as quickly as possible.",8,2,4,2 January 2012
Taxi Driver," Perfect, even for '70s standards
","Although I've seen Taxi Driver many times, on TV and on DVD, today I had the rare opportunity of watching it on the big screen, seated in a dark theatre room, the way all movies should be seen. No matter how many times I watch the movie, and in whatever conditions, I never cease to be amazed at this movie, at its boldness, at the fact it exists at all. The '70s are my favourite era of film, both in American and around the world, and for me Taxi Driver is one of its most magnificent achievements, so many decades later still towering over many of that decade's masterpieces, so ahead of its time the tribulations of the protagonist still disturb modern viewers by how prescient and immediate they are.Robert DeNiro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who can't sleep at nights and drives around, and so he may as well do that for money. Bickle is lonely, socially inept, almost always wears his army jacket, his name written on the back, a part of his identity he clings to tenaciously. Bickle is the proverbial nobody, but in his slowly-decaying mind he conjures thoughts of becoming a great man, of doing something important. His thoughts, though, are as blurry as his conversational skills and he's not sure what he wants to achieve, what ideas are those. Nevertheless constantly writes in his diary that he wants to clean up the city, which is an open sewer full of filth, and the movie slowly shows Bickle changing into a megalomaniac vigilante with delusions of grandeur. The movie, and Bickle, are preparing the viewer for a spectacular finale, and they don't disappoint.Although the movie makes it clear Bickle is slightly unbalanced from the first moment we see him, applying to a job as a cabbie (in a short but memorable scene with Joe Spinell), it doesn't bother trying to give reasons, or any background on his past life. His hatred for lowlifes, pushers, prostitutes and pimps isn't a cause but just something his already deranged brain focuses to release his anger. When he tries to be an ordinary man, and find love and companionship, we see how out of his element he is. His conversations with other cabbies are always tense and awkward. And when he tries to date Betsy, a woman (Cybill Shepherd) involved in a campaign to get Senator Palantine elected as President, she breaks up with him when he casually takes her to a porn movie. When his experiments at normalcy fail, he concentrates his efforts and money to remake himself into a vigilante with a confused plan to murder Palantine on vague motives (Bickle's mind is hazy, the movie never is – it just puts the viewer right in his head, which probably makes not a lot of sense even to himself) before becoming obsessed with saving a teenage prostitute (Jodie Foster) from her smooth-talking pimp (Harvey Keitel).Every scene and line in this movie is carefully thought to show Bickle's deranged state of mind and to carefully and thoroughly chronicle his descent into suicidal madness. Few movies are more perfect than Taxi Driver in bringing together all aspects of filmmaking into a perfect whole. Lawrence of Arabia, Chinatown and 2001: A Space Odyssey before, and a handful since. It's a marvel to see it unwind before your eyes: the dialogue, the performances of everyone, the shots of New York at night, Bernard Herrmann's half romantic half bleak score so often perfectly mirroring and enhancing Bickle's state of mind. Although DeNiro is to commend for this performance, undoubtedly the best of his career, all the other actors are equally excellent, from Shepherd to Foster, from Keitel to a young Albert Brooks in a short but wonderfully comical role. Martin Scorsese's direction was perhaps never this crisp and accurate again, and Paul Schrader never wrote such a remarkable screenplay again. It's clear on every scene that these men and women brought their best talent to the movie, and thanks to their hard work we've been graced with one of the best movies ever made.",10,0,0,10 April 2013
Shutter Island," A Heartbreaking Character Study Masquerading as a Mystery
","I watched Shutter Island a few hours ago and I'm shocked to imagine that I almost missed it on the theaters. The trailer made it look like a modern horror movie: full of silly jump scenes, dissonant music, grainy cinematography, fast editing. I found the trailer so disgusting to look at, I nearly missed the movie.Well, I'm glad I watched it after all, because I wouldn't hesitate to consider it a modern masterpiece. It's also the best Martin Scorsese movie I've seen by him since Casino.The movie, a mystery set in 1954, follows US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, as they arrive at Shutter Island, a desolate place that holds a mental hospital for the criminally insane. Their original mission is to find a patient who disappeared, but Teddy has a secret mission: he believes Shutter Island is keeping sinister secrets, involving experiments on the patients. And he took the mission to get on the island and gather evidence to prove it.To reveal more would spoil the movie.In recent years Martin Scorsese seems to have been making only Oscar bait - his historical epics, Gangs of New York and The Aviator were clear attempts at getting the prized statuette, and it's ironic that it was his least ambitious, more banal movie to date, The Departed, that finally got him an Oscar. But it seems that it released him from this obsession and he has gone back to making great movies without Oscar concerns. Shutter Island is his first movie in a long time to make a good combination of plot and character, and use pacing in an exciting way, drawing the viewer into the story slowly but hypnotically.Leonardo DiCaprio has improved a lot in recent years, taking more interesting projects. In Shutter Island he gives a great performance as Teddy, an ex-soldier who witnessed the liberation of Dachau, haunted by the horrors of the Holocaust, who became a US Marshall only to be hit by a tragedy in his own country. His face and body language, but especially his eyes, transmit the pain of a man who's seen too much and suffered too much and yet continues to cling to life. Although the movie starts as a mystery, it's in fact a character study of Teddy.The supporting cast is just as good: Mark Ruffalo is hit and miss for me, but here he hit it as Teddy's likable partner, Chuck. Ben Kingsley gives a great performance too as Dr. Cawley, a man who radiates nothing but caring for his patients and yet Teddy thinks there's something evil in him. Max Von Sydow, with less screen time than any of the others, is also perfect as a truly sinister doctor.The rest of the movie is in the hands of Scorsese's usual team: Thelma Schoonmaker, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo and Sandy Powell. I loved the cinematography throughout the movie, every shot was so well framed, so elaborate, the movements so fluid and unusual. I was quite happy to learn it was Robert Richardson (Platoon, JFK, The Aviator) in charge of the cinematography: he's one of the best DPs working in Hollywood nowadays.Another aspect that captured my attention was the music; it seemed so fit for each scene I was amazed to discover none of it had been composed for the movie. I especially loved the use of Max Richter's music in it; he composed one of the best scores I've ever listened to - Waltz With Bashir - and his non-film music can be quite good too. The piece used, On The Nature Of Daylight, was one of my favorite tracks in the movie.Shutter Island is an exciting, tense, and heartbreaking movie. Leonardo DiCaprio made Teddy Daniels such a likable person, the ending might leave some people sad over his fate. It's not death, but this movie shows that there are things worse than death in this world. And perhaps that's the best praise I can give this movie, that it shows new types of horrors we're not accustomed to think about. For that, Martin Scorsese and everyone involved in Shutter Island deserve a lot of praise.",9,4,8,14 April 2010
Fargo," Another Brilliant Coen Movie!
","I love the Coens for many things; it is especially for the unique vision and quality they put into their brilliant movies, but it is also for their uncompromising study of the darkest side of Mankind. Ever since they debuted with the superb 'Blood Simple,' the Coens have explored the worst in man's soul and psyche, the horrible things that makes him tick in disturbing ways, the things that leads one to violent, pointless things like kidnapping and murder. 'Fargo' is their darkest movie second only to their disturbing debut. A saving grace this movie has which the other didn't have is basically the dark humour in the right moments to lighten the tension in the air.Like 'Blood Simple,' the story is straightforwardly simple and linear: Jerry Lundegaard, in the middle of personal problems the viewer never figures out exactly what they are, hires Carl and Gaer, two inhuman criminals, to kidnap his wife Jean so his father-in-law will pay a ransom, a part of which will go straight into Jerry's pockets. It sounds too simple to be interesting, but 'Fargo' is really one of most gripping thrillers I've ever seen! The first half hour unfolds smoothly as one would expect  Jerry's plan working just perfectly to avoid innocent deaths  until an unexpected incident turns everything upside-down. Like Carl tells Jerry, 'the circumstances have changed.' And this is when Marge, the most unlikely sheriff to investigate a triple murder ever, comes into the picture and the movie reaches the heights of greatness and perfection.This movie is built on two very simple, well-achieved things. Sure, one can go on about the outstanding cinematography that captures the snow-white landscapes of Minnesota so beautifully, the smooth editing, and the Coens' use of the camera. But 'Fargo' owes its quality to an intelligent screenplay and a wide range of outstanding performances. The dialogue  clear, subtle and economical  transmits volumes of information in just a few lines; not a line is wasted or fails to humanise one of the characters. The story is so fast-paced within the first ten lines we already know what everything is about. Most movies don't really start until the end of the first half hour to comply with the three-act structure device of the plot point. Relationships are established quickly: one immediately gets the sense Wade thinks Jerry is a bumbling fool who can't handle too much responsibility; one sees Jerry doesn't like Wade just from the way he feels uncomfortable in his present. Carl and Gaer's relationship is built on the fact these two men know nothing about each other and have nothing to talk about, as Carl points out to Gaer; the former is the biggest chatterer around, the latter is silent: in essence, these are two complete strangers who just got together to pull of a kidnapping and get money. The quality of this screenplay is also evident in the way the Coens transmit so much information visually: so many things are left unsaid because strong images fill in the holes for the viewer. In the end, this screenplay is the one of the best and most economical screenplays ever written for modern cinema! The performances are consistently great, too! William H. Macy captures the pathetic existence that forms Jerry so well! His lack of determination, his little mannerisms, his idiolect, his hesitation, cravenness, his sense of insecurity; Jerry might just be the greatest human failure in American cinema and Macy played him brilliantly! Frances McDormand is also perfect as the unusual heroine  a pregnant small town sheriff looking for two criminals responsible for a triple murder. McDormand plays Marge wonderfully with all the local innocence inherent in the character, her good manners and strength, so opposed to Jerry's weakness which becomes his doom. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are well-cast as two cruel, greedy, ruthless criminals who recklessly kill and hurt people just for the ridiculous sum of $80,000. Human greed was never so well portrayed as in 'Fargo.' Stormare is great even though he remains silent throughout most of the movie; but Buscemi is just electrifying! He shines in every scene he's in, whether it be when he's collecting the money from Wade, when he's getting his ass kicked hard or just when he shows glimpses of his cruelty like when he snickers at Jerry's helpless, hand-bound, blind-folded wife trying to make her way across a frozen landscape. One last great performance was Harve Presnell's as Wade, the determined father-in-law who spells doom for Jerry.'Fargo' is consistently perfect throughout its 90 minutes: it's a small, but very intense and fast-paced movie. It's not as gripping as the Coens' debut, the movie which to me strikes more similarities with this one than any other Coen movie. But this one isn't as violent, there's also a fantastic dark, acid humour in every scene. The scene where the hulking Shep Proudfoot beats the crap out of a naked Carl is priceless! Like 'Blood Simple,' I originally didn't enjoy 'Fargo:' it took me a few viewings to finally love this movie; today it's one of my favourites! I'm constantly watching it on DVD, marvelling at the small details that make this movie so consistently good. It's another great movie for the Coens in what is an otherwise perfect career!",10,0,0,2 April 2005
Watchmen," Fails as an Adapation, Fails as a Movie
","I have some difficulty judging this movie. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' comic book has become one of my favorite books. I've been rereading it for some six years now, always reveling in the new things I find out or just enjoying the dialogue, action and characters. It's a dense, multi-layered, delightful piece of literature.So I dreaded the adaptation, and yet I couldn't resist watching it. I knew no movie could do justice to a work that was crafted so finely for the comics medium. We live in an age in which so-called writers write garbage that looks like scripts waiting to be shot. Dan Brown's novels come to mind. Watchmen was not that: every page had the language of comics on it.Mr. Zack Snyder evidently doesn't understand that medium nor the one he has decided to work on, for he confuses both. His confusion begins with treating the panels of Gibbons as storyboards. What works in a static medium doesn't work in another in which movement is the key-word. Obviously the movie sounds flat and lifeless, a bit like Sin City, another movie which just turned comics panels into frames.Then Snyder, being a mediocre director, can't even use his medium to good use. Someone should tell that man that just because cameras have an option called slow-mo it shouldn't be used. Everything stops in this movie: a guy jumps, there's a stop; a house explodes, a stop; a kick, a stop. I guess that's meant to be dramatic, but it's just silly.The costumes are mostly appalling. Most seem non-functional, too heavy and hardly suitable for superheroes. And some must have come straight from Batman & Robin's wardrobe; thankfully the nipples are absent. In an age in which superhero movies have come a long way since this awful movie, and has given us great costumes in Spider-Man, Batman Begins, X-Men, Iron Man and Superman, it's sad the costumes of Watchmen look so awful. Exception goes to Rorschach, whose shifting mask is great. Dr. Manhattan is also amazing, but then in this day and age CGI characters are hardly remarkable.The script is god-awful, and I guess David Hayter takes responsibility for that. The characters are one-dimensional (but then the actors aren't that great either) and the plot runs at a frantic pace. Patrick Wilson did a great job with Nite Owl, and I liked Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian. But most seemed to be spouting their lines just for the paycheck without ever believing their characters.In the end it's a fun, campy movie that takes itself too seriously without having any artistic substance to do so. A friend told me the fans won't like it, and the average viewers will find it boring. I don't agree: I think it can be enjoyed by either group, but for anyone who's read the comic it disappoints; and for anyone who likes cinema in itself, it disappoints too. But it entertains and I don't regret the 160 minutes I spent watching it.",5,1,3,14 March 2009
The Killing Fields," A Gut-Wrenching History Lesson
","In 1975 the revolutionary group Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia and initiated a regime that reportedly claimed two million lives. At the time the Vietnam War was still going on, Cambodia was a strategic territory for the American army and the country was full of journalists. The basis of the movie's story comes from the lives of two of them: New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, and Dith Pran, Cambodian photojournalist and interpreter who coined the term 'Killing Fields.' Written by Bruce Robinson based on their writings, the movie follows in fact two stories: one is the fall of Phnom Penh, the capital, and the evacuation of the international embassies, as witnessed by Sydney and Pran, and Sydney's return to the USA; and the second, more radical narrative, shows the horrors of the Khmer Rouge as witnessed by Pran after he's captured and sent to work in a Killing Field, and his epic escape to freedom.From Phnom Penh Sydney and Pran report the events of the civil war between the government and the Khmer Rouge, with the revolutionaries clearly gaining control of the country. The international embassies start evacuating their personnel. Sydney and Pran opt to remain, although Pran sends his wife and family away. As the Khmer Rouge revolutionaries enter the city, they're initially received with joy and prospects of peace, everyone tired of the war. Even Pran joins the festivities. However the Khmer Rouge, split in different factions due to internal power struggles, continue to fight in the capital. Sydney and Pran find refuge in the French embassy, until it's also evacuated and all Cambodians hiding there are turned over to the revolutionaries.For the time, the movie was quite revolutionary in casting a non-amateur actor in the role of Dith Pran. They found Haing Somnang Ngor, a doctor living in the USA, to portray Pran. Like Pran, Ngor had also spent four years in the killing fields before escaping. He won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1985 for this role. He played the role with naturalism and lightness, displaying a restraint in emotions in situations where an actor would typically go into melodramatic mode. The choice of Ngor is ahead of its time for another reason. Anglo-American movies tend to work on the logic that audiences can only care for the plight of foreign countries if the experiences are mediated through a character from their culture; that's why war correspondents are usually the main characters in such movies. Although now thanks to movies like Letters from Iwo Jima and Hotel Rwanda this is changing, casting a Cambodian actor to tell the story of a Cambodian prisoner of the Khmer Rouge was audacious then.Sam Waterston also delivers a powerful performance as Sydney, an authoritarian boss who blames himself for having used Pran to further his career only to abandon him. Back in New York he starts an international campaign to find his friend, always wondering whether he's doing enough for him. The movie is also helped with performances from John Malkovich and Julian Sands as two other journalists, Craig T. Nelson as the US Army officer in charge of the American evacuation, and Spalding Gray as the morally-torn American Consul, wary of abandoning the country to the revolutionaries.The scenes in the Killing Fields still have, decades later and after graphic violence has become generalised, the power to affect because of how the movie shows the psychological roots of the crimes. It's not that the images are excessively violent, it's that the movie depicts a philosophy of inhumanity. Regimes don't just producer horror for its own sake, the violence is just a tool to implement ideas. Rather than just showing the horrors, the movie shows the philosophy which the violence was used to enforce: the viewer is taken into the classrooms where children are being taught to hate the concept of family and any personal relationships that may threaten blind loyalty to the party; children are given power over life and death; intellectuals, teachers, journalists are executed for their skills; people are forbidden from growing crops, because that's a sign of free initiative, even though thousands are starving to death The movie confronts us with those ideas and we can't help but ask, 'How the hell did anyone ever think these ideas could work in a society?' Not everything holds up as well in the movie. Many good scenes are ruined by Mike Oldfield's intrusive cacophony of synthesizer noises. Nowadays, when we listen to electronic scores with less patience than our ancestors did back in the '80s, a lot of this music sounds horrible. Oldfield, one of my favourite living musicians, is by no means an inept film composer, however: half the score, when he turns to traditional orchestration, is majestic. 'Pran's Theme' and its variations are appropriately elegiac, and 'Requim for a City,' with its chorus of grieving voices, is a haunting attempt at showing through music the misery of the one million Cambodians forced by the Khmer Rouge to abandon the capital in a forced march to the countryside to work on the Killing Fields.Twenty-seven years later what the movie has to say about the darkness in the human soul, and the determination to overcome it, remains fresh.",9,5,5,13 January 2012
North by Northwest," Hilarious Thriller About Mistaken Identities
","North By Northwest is my favorite movie by Alfred Hitchcock. He may have made better movies, artistically speaking, like Vertigo and Psycho. But for me neither surpasses the entertainment this movie provides.This is a chase movie and follows Cary Grant as a New York businessman, Roger Thornhill, who's mistaken by spies as a secret agent and is forced to flee from them while trying to get in touch with someone who will help him clear the mess he got into. It's pretty much nonstop action filled with very tense situations and sequences. The movie is famous for the amazing airplane sequence, but there is more to the movie than that.This is also a delightful romance movie, when Roger meets Eve (played by Eva maria Saint) aboard a train and she becomes an ally in his mission. Their relationship goes through many twists, but the chemistry between Grant and Marie Saint is perfect and the happy ending is one of the most deserved I've ever seen in a movie.Ernest Lehman provides the screenplay, which is one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. Legend has it that Hitchcock merely gave Lehman a few key scenes and Lehman built the entire story out of them. What he achieved was a funny, lighthearted thriller full of humor and hilarious lines and bigger-than-life characters.I've never seen Cary Grant this dashing and heroic and amusing before except in a very Hitchcockian movie called Charade. He was an amazing actor who brought lightness and invention to the screen with ease, and here he gives perhaps his best performance.As far as thrillers go, North By Northwest remains one of the masterpieces of the genre, showing just what the genre can achieve when filmmakers are only willing to be original and inventive.",10,2,5,17 February 2010
Judgment at Nuremberg," This Is What They Call The Banality of Evil
","What could I possibly say in this meek review that does any justice to this amazing movie? Let's consider the cast to begin with: Spency Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Maximilian Schell, Montgomery Clift, Richard Widmark, Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich. When was so much talent together in a single movie? Then there's the enormity of the plot: a movie about the Nuremberg trials of Nazis involved in war crimes. It's a testament to Stanely Kramer and Abby Mann that this movie rather than being a simple condemnation of evil by a victorious country over a conquered country, is a complex, challenging analysis of morality, responsibility, duty, and patriotism. In fact the movie is downright cynical in its presentation of justice.This marvelous courtroom drama follows Hans Rolfe (Schell) as the defense lawyer of four judges charged with collaborating with the Nazi regime in the perversion of justice for political reasons. Rolfe puts up an amazing defense, one that pulls no punches. As wonderfully as Schell plays him, there's something repulsive about Rolfe in his use of logic for saving his clients. One watches him in awe, wondering whether the passion he exhibits is genuine or not.His opponent is Colonel Tad Lawson, a man who witnessed the atrocities of the concentration camps and is personally committed to having the four judges sentenced. Richard Widmark plays him like a man possessed, driven by the horrors he witnessed and disgusted with the idea that they may yet walk free. The acme of his performance is when he describes a movie shown in court, depicting the horrors inside a concentration camp. His chilling voice is so filled with anger and sorrow, one believes Widmark was really there.Of the four defendants stands out Ernst Janning. Burt Lancaster plays him with restraint, in fact he barely speaks in the whole movie until he breaks it in one of the most dramatic moments of the movie and then gives one of the best speeches in the entire movie. For the most part he plays his role with his eyes, expressive and full of pain and remorse. How he (and Widmark) missed an Oscar nomination is beyond me.Spencer Tracy was nominated for Best Leading Actor, eventually losing to Schell for his passionate performance. Tracy doesn't seem to do much but that's his role as Judge Haywood; he's a mediator, the voice of reason and order when Rolfe and Lawson go over the top. His role is to show restraint, up until the end of the movie when he has to give out the sentence. Then he outperforms everyone in the movie.Great supporting actors waltz through this movie and leave amazing performances too. Two that can't be forgotten are by Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland. I'm not sure if I'd ever seen Clift in a movie before, but the few minutes he was in this movie held me in thrall. I was in awe of the way he used his voice, hands and whole body to show the psychological marks left on his character, an innocent German who was sterilized on grounds of being mentally retarded.Judy Garland, whom I knew only from The Wizard of Oz, plays Irene Hoffman, a woman who in her adolescence becomes indirectly responsible for the Nazis killing a Jewish man she had befriended. Her testimony and confrontation with Rolfe mark one of the high points of the movie.In fact I'd say this three-hour-long movie is one long series of high points. There were so many amazing moments in the movie I pretty much lost count. It makes a good case of questioning the role ordinary Germans had in the Nazi atrocities, but also shows how easy it was to sympathies with an ideology that promised to save a country in ruins. More importantly, it's a chilling portrayal of what Hannah Arendt called the banality of evil - Eichmann, the subject of her book is ever mentioned in the a disturbing scene in which a man in charge of a concentration camp explains in a very casual way how easy it was to burn thousands of victims in ovens. As Judge Haywood says, what makes the four men on trial special is that they weren't maniacs or sadists, but ordinary men. This movie was quite ahead of its time, when we think that Hollywood is always criticized for making simple good vs. evil stories. What makes this movie so incredible is that the defendants weren't evil, they were just people doing their job. Even today some movies would be afraid of being so honest.So Stanley Kramer and Abby Mann not only deserve credit for having made a superb movie, perfect in pretty much all its aspects, but also for making one of the most interesting studies of the nature of evil in the history of cinema.",9,0,1,24 March 2010
The Battle of Algiers," Brilliant
","The '60s were full of great political thrillers thanks to the revolutionary atmosphere of the time; notions like colonialism were being challenged, and the former European colonies all over the world were fighting their invaders and claiming their autonomy. From this spirit of Independence came Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers, which chronicles with some drama the Algerian resistance against the French settlers.Mixing the genres of war and thriller, this masterpiece shows the messy business of fighting for freedom. What I loved about this movie was its balance in the portrayal of both sides. Civil uprisings are ugly, and Pontecorvo shows how both settlers and settled can and will use any means to achieve their goals.First we have the Algerian resistance, targeting initially policemen. As the French authorities retaliate against civilians, the resistance soon goes after French civilians too. And back and forth in an escalation of violence which soon brings in the paratroopers with their torture methods to smoke out hidden terrorists.The French soldiers of course seem monsters, but its representative, Colonel Mathieu, reminds people those were the same soldiers who fought in the French resistance against the Nazis and who employ torture because the French public opinion Algeria to remain French. In a movie without clear heroes and villains, Pontecorvo shows one of the tragedies of war: how normal people can easily lose their innocence for their beliefs.Besides being expertly written and directed, the cast is also excellent, with newcomer Brahim Hadjadj playing a very human terrorist, Jean Martin as the impenetrable Colonel Mathieu and Saadi Yacef playing Djafar, the head of the resistance.Ennio Morricone, who most have scored all Italian movies of this period, gives us another one of his impressive scores, dramatic, exciting, tense and melancholic in all the right places.Another great aspect of this movie is the editing itself. This has some of the best silent montages I've ever seen, from people searching for bodies in a bombed out house, to three terrorist women preparing themselves to blow up their bombs, to the French soldiers invading the Casbah and rounding up all suspects. This movie works in powerful visuals without the aid of words, making it a fine example of film language at its best.The Battle of Algiers is a film not to be missed. To do so would be to ignore of the finest war movies and political thrillers ever made.",9,0,1,7 June 2009
The White Ribbon," Mysteries Without Solutions
","The White Ribbon was one of the best 2009 movies I saw. My only previous experience with Michael Haneke had been 2001's The Piano Teacher, which I loathed. I didn't know what to expect from this black-and-white movie; I feared I'd hate it or find it boring. Besides, it's winning all the awards I was expecting to see A Prophet win, which for me was the best 2009 movie. Now I'm not so sure.The White Ribbon is above a well-crafted piece of cinema by a master of the medium. That's evident in the way he shoots the shadows and the outdoor light, playing with the contrasts and setting up beautiful frames; in the way he keeps the viewer in thrall without the need of music, wonderfully using silence as a part of the experience; in the way he recreates an era through dialogue, mannerisms, dogmas, social rules, costumes; and, for a movie centred on children, the way he gets amazing performances from the young actors, of several ages, who had to play complex roles. I haven't seen children and adolescents perform so well in a movie since Fernando Meirelle's City of God.The story seems not to amount to much, but in the hands of Haneke it's a gripping mystery. In a small German village mysterious incidents happen: a doctor falls off his horse because someone put a wire across the road; someone sets a barn on fire; the local Baron's child is kidnapped and whipped. Who's doing all this? Are the events connected? Are the children involved? And if so, does it have anything to do with the oppressive way they're treated? People who enjoy puzzles will certainly enjoy spending hours discussing this movie, trying to make sense of it, even though I'd say it's impossible to ever get down to the truth. For those that don't care about speculation, these mysteries nevertheless allow us to see the way the village works, with its prejudices, hatreds, secrets, envies, fears, strange hierarchies. In sum it allows the village to become a theatre about the human condition, although one that only depicts the worst in mankind.I've read interpretations that suggest that this movie is an allegory for Nazism; that it seeks to explain how Fascism appeared; that the children in the movie would grow to become Nazi generation. I think that's possible, but I think it's also too reductive and if that were so why Haneke bother with such a roundabout way of doing things? I think this movie mocks exactly such simple, reductive answers. Children are spanked and disciplined, and that led to Nazis! But the same generation that begot Nazis also begot Nazi opponents. The same educational system that created Hitler also created Einstein. And Germany wasn't the only country that used harsh methods to bring up children.This movie is a mystery in the vein of many great European mysteries. I think Europe produces mysteries that go beyond the mere fascination about finding clues. They even go beyond the psychological mystery, which is about finding clues in a person's mind or behaviour. No, these are anti-mysteries, movies that suggest that reality is just undecipherable, that logic and reason are not enough to explain everything. This puts The White Ribbon on the level of masterpieces like L'Avventura, Blowup, Professione: Reporter, and Mr. Klein. Good European cinema continues to exist.",9,7,22,20 January 2010
The Exorcist," Horror Movie That Celebrates The Best In Humanity
","Like many people I watched The Exorcist decades after it was made. Like many I grew up on the hype that it was the scariest horror movie ever made and found it tame and disappointing. Unlike most, however, I didn't let this affect my enjoyment of the movie. When I watched it a second time and judged solely as a movie and not the ultimate cinematic experience in horror, I discovered I was watching one of the best and most beautiful movies ever made.In an otherwise peaceful suburb, the young Regan becomes strange: first she starts talking with imaginary friends, then she becomes restless and violent. Her mother, Chris, takes her to the doctor but science can't explain her illness and strange phenomena surrounds daughter and mother: a nearby church is desecrated; the child starts talking in foreign languages, objects move without touch.There is never any doubt that this movie is about a demon that has possessed a child. But one of the distinguishing marks of this movie is the logical progression of the plot. There are several rational explanations for Megan's behavior that must be demolished before the exorcism becomes the only possible solution and salvation.We can say that the movie follows two different narratives for a while until they come together at the end: first Chris' struggle to find the cure for whatever is hurting her daughter. Seldom has a horror movie displayed such a loving and strong character as Chris McNeil, wonderfully played Ellen Burstyn. Her never-ending, tireless pursuit borders on obsession but also shows the love she has for Regan, the innocent victim.The second story concerns Father Damien Karras, a priest struggling with his faith. Jason Miller, an unknown actor, became one of my favorite actors after I saw his performance here. Beginning with his melancholy and tired face, Miller is the perfect actor to play Karras, a man who seems to carry the world's problems on his shoulders. He not only doubts his vocation and the existence of God, but he's tormented by the guilt of having abandoned his mother at an institution in which she killed herself and died alone. Furthermore, he's a rational, skeptical man. When Chris comes to him to ask for an exorcism, he mocks the idea considering the advances in psychology that has debunked all talk of demonic possession. But kind as he is, he nevertheless interviews Regan and slowly he becomes convinced that she is indeed possessed.Before these two stories begin, there is a prologue, a ten-minute sequence in Iraq, in which we're introduced to Father Merrin. This character is absent from most of the movie up until the moment of the exorcism, that some may think the prologue exists merely to introduce him. But the Iraq sequence pretty much explains the entire movie, not to mention it's one of the most beautiful sequences ever filmed.It starts with Merrin digging at archaeological site. He discovers a statue's head representing a demon. This leads him to think an old enemy has returned (we later learn Merrin once came across the demon in Megan). Cocophony abounds in the sound of blacksmiths hitting iron, the voices of the market and dog growls. Sound will later become very important in the movie. Small events lead Merrin to fear the worst, like a clock that suddenly stops, showing that the natural order has stopped too. He travels to outside the city, where two dogs are fighting each other. He climbs some ruins and stands before a demonic statue. Mortal and demon stare at each other; never has the battle of good versus evil been depicted in such clarity. Then the dog growls intensify as the sun turns red and the growls turn into the sound of airplane jets, in one of best transitions I've ever ever seen in cinema, and we arrive at Chris' house.The Exorcist, I said, is one of the best movies ever made. It has some of the best production values I've ever seen: the use of sound, for instance, is still unique. The cinematography is unforgettable too, capturing the world in shadows and dark tones. The actors are all good: Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, Jason Miller, Linda Blair, and also Lee J. Cobb as a kind police detective investigating a murder connected to Regan.The intelligence of the script is also unique in the history of horror. There's never a false step, nothing that makes the viewer scratch his head in wonder or that requires suspension of mental faculties, like many horror movies today. The movie takes itself seriously and respects the viewer's ability to think for himself and make his own connections.Finally, The Exorcist is just a great story about human goodness. For a movie about the Devil, it's amazing how much decency, altruism and heroism there is in the movie, how little nihilism it contains. I've already talked about Chris, the tireless mother, but credit must also go to Fathers Merrin and Karras, two of the best heroes cinema ever produced, as they selflessly confront evil beyond comprehension with nothing but their faith and goodness. If you ever need to watch a movie to restore your faith in humanity, The Exorcist is the movie to watch.",10,0,1,14 February 2010
No Country for Old Men," A Movie Directed by the Coens
","When I saw this movie at the cinema, I remember loving it. I still do. But as I was coming out and thinking about what I had just seen, I realized I hadn't seen a Coens movie. I had just seen a thriller that happened to be directed by the Coens.No Country for Old Men is one of the finest movies I've seen in recent years, and like most Coens fans I rejoiced in their winning the Oscars at last. But I wish they had been recognized for a movie that's more similar to their usual work. I have no complaints about the technical aspects of the movie: sound, editing, cinematography are all excellent. The acting is good, especially Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin's. Javier Bardem didn't impress me the way he did everyone else that year: I think cinema has enough one-dimensional, monotone pseudo-philosophical badass villains who behave like the Terminator as it is. But I can't blame the Coens. They're just following Cormac McCarthy's novel here.Most of my complaints spring from novel. The Coens, constrained by it, couldn't fill the movie with their usual brand of nonsense and quirky humor. This is a serious movie, more serious than a heart attack, although it's nothing more than a chase movie. Not even in Blood Simple, arguably the Coens most darkest movie, were they ever this serious; they counteracted it with a lot of off-beat humor.One of things I love in the Coens is how life is pretty cheap. Visser in Blood Simple can kill for just $10,000. In Fargo, Carl and Gaear can kidnap just for $80,000. Pathetic amounts when we think about the millions that usually pop in crime movies. But it shows how cruel people can. Not in this movie: $2,000,000 are at stake here, a sum worth killing for indeed. I can't blame Anton Chigurh (Bardem) for having so much trouble about it.Apart from minor quibbles, No Country for Old Men is worth watching. The things the Coens do with sound, silence and shadows in this movie is amazing. Roger Deakins deserved an Oscar. The first showdown between Moss (Brolin) and Chigurh is just a masterpiece of suspense.Tommy Lee Jones gives my favorite performance in the movie, as an aging, small-town sheriff who can't really cope with the dark modern world of Chigurh. Jones projects so much world-weariness and sadness onto his face, you feel he's really been a cop all his life.All in all, this is a tense, fast-paced thriller, worth watching as much for its story as for its technical aspects. It's a great movie. It's just not a great Coens movie.",8,1,3,9 April 2009
Batman Begins," Ridiculous Pseudo-Artistic Action Movie
","'Batman Begins' should have been one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen only I didn't have that many expectations to begin with. However, it managed to leave me mad. As I write this review, I've just come out from watching 'Sin City,' and in this Roberto Rodriguez movie you have everything that Christopher Nolan's movie tried to get right but failed miserably! What especially bothers me about 'Batman Begins' is its pretentiousness! It's because it perverts a movie's nature trying to make it be something it cannot be; it's pretentious because, for all the acclaim Nolan got with 'Memento,' he's not an artistic director with indie sensibilities; and it's pretentious because it's no more than a summer action blockbuster pretending to be an artistic movie! But neither Nolan has the intellect to pull off a truly artistic ambition nor can anyone make an artistic movie out of $150m budget. It cannot happen because no Hollywood studio that puts up so much money will ever allow it. So Nolan can fool how many people he wants with this ordinary action movie, this is not the great masterpiece being hyped on the internet and through word of mouth.It's no better than the 'Spiderman' and 'X-men' franchises: they in fact invented the formula and gave a better use; we're finally living in an era where superhero movies are being taken seriously and given the 'realistic' treatment. 'Batman Begins' tries to be painfully realistic and horribly fails  first of all, because at the end of the day it will still be about a man that dresses up like a bat; and because, unlike 'X-Men' and 'Spiderman,' its realistic moments are boring and messy. The ridiculous beginning with Bruce Wayne in a prison somewhere in Asia is just ridiculous. Starting the movie with dialog like 'I'm your demon,' 'no, you're practice' immediately destroyed my hopes. It then moves to a strange, gratuitous brawl.But let's start with the fine points  I must admit there are some. First of all, I enjoyed several of the flashback scenes predating Bruce's self-exile from Gotham City. The scenes with young Bruce playing in the garden with Rachel; his failed attempt to kill Joe Chill; his conversation with Carmine Falcone at the restaurant  those were all very good. And Christian Bale was very good in all his Bruce Wayne scenes. In fact, acting is something I can't complain about in this movie: Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, tom Wilkinson and Liam Neeson were all very good. Of course Gary Oldman was better than anyone else, but he's Gary Oldman: really, his performance as Jim Gordon was just superb. However, as good as actors they may be, they're still only playing mediocre, one-dimensional characters. Bale even got the chance to play two one-dimensional characters in a single movie! Now Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy  whom everyone is over-praising  were just plain dull! And this is where all the problems with the movie begin. Starting with Liam Neeson's character, the villain Ra's Al Ghul is just one cliché after another. Every line he utters is full of pseudo-philosophical pearls of wisdom. It's like he never stopped being a Jedi  'you must face your fears,' 'you've traveled all over the world but now you must travel inwards,' 'will is everything.' Honestly, with corny dialog like this, what claim does anyone have to complain about 'Revenge Of The Sith.' I didn't feel as embarrassed watching Lucas' movie as I did watching Nolan's.I won't even discuss the ridiculous plot. Now I'd discuss the action, only I couldn't make out anything of it, being so dark, fast-paced and full of close-ups. In an action movie not even the action they got right!? Gotham City is a city we've seen countless times in cinema over the past 23 years. It's basically 'Blade Runner' without the rain and Asians. I saw Gotham City a few years ago in 'The Matrix,' and before that in 'The Crow,' also in 'Dark City' and more recently 'Minority Report.' However I haven't seen a distinctive aesthetic like the one Tim Burton envisioned for his Gotham City lately. That was a unique vision, Nolan's is just derivative trash. Even the Batmobile is an ugly piece of metal. In its attempt to conform to the hyper-aggressive trend in modern superhero movies, we get a ridiculous tank with three wheels capable of silly stunts.I can't expect this to be worse than 'Fantastic Four,' but then that's another movie I'm not getting my hopes high for. In the end, 'Batman Begins' is just a big disappointing pseudo-artistic action flick: it'll disappoint anyone who wants action; it'll disappoint anyone who believed the hype about the complex characters and great dialog  people like me  and it'll disappoint people who are bothered to deconstruct this piece of trash and see it for the sub par movie it really is.",5,2,4,30 June 2005
The Princess Bride," The Ultimate Fantasy Movie?
","The Princess Bride is one of the most sincere and heartfelt fantasy movies I've ever seen. The movie is framed as a story that a grandfather reads to his sick grandson and it's a perfect idea for a movie that has some tongue-in-cheek takes on fantasy clichés.The story begins with Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and Westley (Cary Elwes), two farmers who fall in love. He decides to leave and return one day a rich man to marry her. Then she hears he was killed by a pirate and Prince Humperdinck decides to make her his bride. But when they least expect Westley returns for 'true love' and the story turns into one of the funniest and most fast-paced adventure ever. There are deadly eels, giant rodents, dangerous forests, giants, revenge-obsessed swordsmen, and miracles. The heroes are noble and fair, and the villains despicable. And true love wins in the end. A movie has never been more honest about its intentions than The Princess Bride.The cast is mostly great, especially Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin, a swordsman looking for the man who killed his father. Penn could have been a more interesting character than the usual damsel in distress, but I guess some clichés you just don't touch. Peter Falk has a short but adorable role as the grandfather trying to pass to his grandson some of the pleasure of reading books.The Princess Bride is a wonderful story that should appeal to anyone who never lost their sense of wonder and who still like to see the good guys truly win without compromises, something rare these days in mainstream cinema. It's a charming movie that has no pretensions about what it is and which does everything right. Watch it and love it!",7,3,7,31 July 2009
The Pianist," An Ode to the Triumph of the Human Spirit
","The Pianist is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. It describes the life of Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a meek, ordinary man living in Warsaw when World War II starts. His life up until then is a bed of roses: he's a young, attractive man, and he plays piano over the radio. People know him and admire him.The war changes everything and all of a sudden Szpilman, a Jew, becomes one of the many victims of Nazi Germany. What the movie depicts is the complete breakdown of his ordinary life and his struggle to survive in the Warsaw Ghetto, hidden from the authorities.Directed by Roman Polanski, the movie is evidently brutal in its depiction of cruelty, or rather the banality of cruelty. Polanski shows horrible acts in the most, non-dramatic fashion: wheelchair-bound people being thrown off windows; children being beaten to death; people being shot for asking questions. He shows Szpilman and his family breaking apart: they go to the camps, with the certainty of death; Szpilman manages to run and becomes a wanderer in the empty Ghetto, surviving thanks to the good will of people, and to his own resourcefulness. Hidden in an apartment, he witnesses the world from a window, waiting for the end. From here he witnesses the Uprising, a heroic but failed attempt by the Jews to fight back the Nazis.Bleak as the movie is, The Pianist also has a lot of humor, even some comic relief, as well as an emphasis on the brighter side of human existence. It's quite easy to create misery and draw pity from a viewer. But Only great art knows that life is never simple or reducible to one view. Darkness and light, ugliness and beauty, despair and humor always exist hand-in-hand. No scene shows that more accurately than the ending, in which Szpilman is saved by the most unlikely of people.Adrien Brody is magnificent in this movie. Although he's not an actor I like, because he seems to take a personal glee in choosing horrible movies to star in, he nevertheless gives life-defining performance here, as the embodiment of the human will to survive against all adversities. Thomas Kretschmann, in his short role, was unforgettable too.After decades making masterworks, Roman Polanski was finally rewarded with an Oscar. Not only that but he was rewarded for one of his best movies. Ronald Harwood, who adapted Szpilman's autobiography, also deserved his Oscar, as well as Brody himself. On a final note, Pawel Edelman, the director of cinematography, contributed to making this movie the wonder it is, in his composition of every shot. His work in this movie should put him alongside great DPs like Roger Deakins and Robert Richardson. Great movies are a synthesis of many aspects, and few movies bring them together so seamlessly and perfectly as The Pianist.",9,0,1,14 February 2010
Lawrence of Arabia," Cinema Reaches Its Zenith
","David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia stands, for me at least, as the greatest movie ever made. I wouldn't say it's my favourite – that title goes to Roman Polanski's Chinatown – but objectively I cannot conceive any movie superior, either on technical or acting matters. It's one of the few perfect movies I know. It's also one of the movies I'd gladly pay money to see on a big screen.Using the life story of T.E. Lawrence, Lean, and his masterful screenwriter, Robert Bolt, create an epic movie about a British officer fighting in Arabia during World War I, who becomes a legend in his own time, the man known as Lawrence of Arabia.The movie shows Lawrence befriending the Arabs, organising them in an army, leading a successful terror campaign against the Turks, becoming intoxicated with his own power and attempting to create an Arab state that would be free of any British influence.Unlike the mediocre biopics that today merely illustrate a life, without any artistic flair, Lean and Bolt's masterwork celebrates the enigma that was Lawrence: they show him as an apparently mediocre officer who surprised everyone by becoming a master strategist; an officer loathed by his superiors and admired by the Arabs; a man very close to treason in his ambition to create an Arab State, going against all the political aspirations foreign interests had for that area; a poet who hid a sadistic streak. Nothing is simple in this many-faced man's life. Just compare the complexity of this figure with the treatment Nelson Mandela gets in Invictus, for instance, to use one modern biopic. In less than 10 minutes Mandela is explained, he holds no mysteries, all the complexity of his existence was reworked for mass consumption. At the end of 200 minutes, people will continue to scratch their heads trying to make sense of Lawrence of Arabia's personality.As Lean develops the enigma that is Lawrence, he simultaneously rewards the viewer with some of the film-making ever. Ever shot is delicately composed, his camera captures the majesty and dread of the still desert, his characters are but ants in the wide canvases that he paints. One aspect of Lawrence personality that is much explored is his sense of superiority, and I can't think of a better way of ridiculing this than showing Lawrence as an insect on screen.Lawrence of Arabia gathers an envious cast of actors: a young Peter O'Toole, who dazzled the world with his performance; Omar Sharif, who plays a friend, or the closest thing Lawrence can have to a friend; Anthony Quinn as an Arab tribe leader; Alec Guiness as Prince Feisal; Claude Rains playing a man who represents British interests in Arabia; and Jack Hawkins as the manipulative General Allenby. There are other great roles for Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quayle and Arthur Kennedy too. I may as well name every actor since I can't think of anyone who was bad in this movie.The relationships between all these characters have provided some of the finest meditations on human nature and its complexity. There's nothing simple about these men: they're experienced citizens of the world, each one with his private interests that go from nationalism to political power to delusions of grandeur. Nobility, heroism, treason, ruthlessness, friendship are so pure, so serious in this movie that I have to go back to Homer to find an equal treatment of these topics in art. There's none of the self-consciousness that poisons so much modern art in this movie. The characters represent these ideas entirely without hesitation.Completing the perfection of this movie is Maurice Jarre's unforgettable score, a score so unique when one hears it one immediately knows its source. Jarre composed some of the bests scores for cinema working with David Lean, and Lawrence of Arabia is perhaps his greatest achievement. Like all else in the movie, it's perfection.",10,0,1,14 February 2010
City of God," The Best Movie of the New Millennium
","City of God is one of the most fascinating movies of the new millennium, a masterpiece in all aspects of film-making: cinematography, editing, writing and directing, assisted by solid performances by amateur child actors from Rio de Janeiro's slums.This movie, based on a novel by Paulo Lins, is about the history of the Brazilian slum City of God, where people born there have little alternative to crime and violence. Through inventive storytelling, the director Fernando Meirelles and screenwriter Bráulio Mantovani show the slum from its earliest days when it was just a suburb distant from the tourist attractions to the present days, when it's no longer invisible and has become an embarrassment for authorities.To show the development of the slum, the filmmakers follow the lives of two distinct young men: Rocket, a nice kid who wants out and dreams of becoming a photographer; and the ruthless crime lord, Li'l Zé, who takes over the slums and engages in open warfare in the streets with other gangs. Rocket and Zé's history is intimately connected from their early days as kids, when Zé, eager for killing, kills Rocket's brother, a member of a famous gang. The new takes over the old, that's the law of City of God.This movie is cruel and uncompromising. Armed children kill themselves in street wars, police corruption is everywhere, and, as Rocket discovers, being honest may not pay off. Zé's rise to power is meteoric as he uses the only language understandable: violence. He's one of the most charismatic villains of recent years; mean as snakes, without a single redeeming feature, enjoying evil for its sake, either you'll love him or hate him.The movie also benefits from other great characters: there's Benny, Zé's only friend, who behaves a bit like what remains of his consciousness and possibly the only person who can calm down Zé. Benny is the cool criminal, he doesn't want to get rich for its sake, he doesn't want to kill people. He just wants money to have fun and party with other people.Then there's the street vigilant Knockout Ned, a good man who just becomes fed up with the crime and decides to make matters into his rifle-holding hands. A trained soldier, he organizes an army against Zé in a war without truces to get control of the streets. It's amazing how a movie shot in the streets of Rio de Janeiro can acquire an epic feel that many epics lack nowadays.In the middle is Rocket, trying to live a normal life, doing what teenagers do: falling in love, trying to get a job, hanging out with friends. For a grim movie, it's amazing how the filmmakers also capture the finer aspects of adolescence, with a maturity that American movies sadly lack.All in all, City of God is one of the best movies of recent years that can't be ignored. I also admire it for having introduced me to a lot of fine Brazilian cinema being made nowadays. City of God is just the beginning, really. Movies like Tropa de Elite and The Man Who Copied await those who give it a try.",10,2,4,11 April 2009
The Lives of Others," Captivating Movie About Power, Altruism and Freedom
","'No matter how often you say it in your plays, people do not change!' an East Germany minister declares to playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) in the movie. This is an ironic statement considering that East Germany in 1984 was part of Soviet Union at the time, and communism is predicated on the belief that human nature is malleable and that people can be improved, even if one has to break a few eggs in the process. It also encapsulates the protagonist's arc: the moral rebirth of Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), a high officer in the secret police, the feared Stasi. Wiesler, entrusted by his social-climbing superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), to spy on Dreyman and his actress girlfriend, Christa (Martina Gedeck) in the hope of finding something that will destroy him so a minister can have Christa for himself.This is the plot, at turns far-fetched and sentimental, but mostly chilling and heart-wrenching, that filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck found to depict the actions of the secret police in East Germany. It's a plot that has its strengths and weaknesses, the most evident being the unclear motivation of the methodical, emotionally detached Wiesler to risk his career in helping a trouble-making playwright. Wiesler is a cipher without a back-story; his political convictions, or lack of them, aren't properly addressed in the film: we can't tell whether he's a staunch supporter or just an everyman doing his job by conformity. The movie portrays him as a lonely, efficient, paranoid workaholic. So his about-face raises questions of motivation.This, incidentally, is a difficulty I often find in movies about protagonists who rebel against criminal organizations they previously worked for. An example from recent years can be found in Syriana. You'll remember George Clooney plays a CIA agent who, after a lifetime serving the agency, discovers it's doing bad things. The intelligent viewer will, of course, pause to wonder what rock he lived under when he wasn't in a mission, to consider that the CIA was a benign agency, when there's ample literature documenting its countless crimes, such as drugging its own agents with LSD to study the after-effects, paying a Canadian psychiatrist to perform illegal shock therapy on unwilling patients, and occasionally backing military coups in democracies. In the 21st century a CIA agent can't be that innocent. But Syriana needed a rogue CIA agent. And The Lives of Others needed a Stasi agent to learn to become human again, and that's a development that is always hard to portray convincingly. For how does a person learn to become good? We'll just invoke the acte gratuite here. Writer André Gide came up with this term, which translates roughly into gratuitous act, to name unmotivated actions needed to start the plot. The movie, of course, takes a shot at explaining Wiesler's metamorphosis, and that's another one of its weaknesses. Henckel, being a filmmaker, an artist, evidently believes art can improve people. The movie chalks up Wiesler's transformation to the art he comes into contact while surveilling the playwright's apartment. This reaches its climax when he cries listening to Beethoven's 'Appassionata'. 'Can anyone who has heard this music,' the playwright asks Christa while he plays it in the piano, Wiesler listening to them, 'I mean truly heard it, really be a bad person?' History proves, yes, they can, Mr. Idealistic-Writer-Bordering-On-Parody. But this movie will prove that people who like Beethoven are all self-sacrificing and intrinsically good. They just need a string of well-articulated tunes to remember them of their humanity. We'll forgive Henckel for this since it's an artist's prerogative to be naive.The good far outweighs the bad in this movie, though. Its acting and writing are superb. The screenplay humanizes the Stasi agents in a way that is probably too unpleasant for some viewers, which makes it as courageous as another German movie, The Downfall, which boldly portrayed Adolf Hitler as a three-dimensional character several years ago. Although it's easier to hate monsters, the characters in this movie are all too familiar in their pettiness, ambitions, fear and subservience. Power is the most overt theme in the movie, after freedom of expression, and the movie does a good job of showing the hierarchy of power in East Germany, from the untouchable ministers down to the Stasi officers, the agents on the field, and finally the citizens at the bottom of the pyramid, spied on, interrogated, blackmailed and tortured arbitrarily.The dialogue is excellent too, focused on the story while developing the characters, and full of double-entendres: dialogue, like the characters, has two faces, a private and a public one, the word's meaning changing according to circumstances, which makes this movie perfect for repeated viewings. The actors must have realized how good their roles were because they brought their best talent to it. Although the acting is generally good, Ulrich Mühe is head and shoulder above his co-stars. He delivers a fantastic performance as an emotionally reserved secret agent who lays his soul bare without the usual overwrought shenanigans that characterize Oscar-baiting performances. His minimalist acting, which mirrors the effect of his work on his existence, triumphantly results in one of the best performances of the last decade.Although the acting and writing are top notch, Henckel could have done better with the directing. The camera work won't impress anyone. In this regard, the movie looks a lot like a play.Still, the acting and the writing are so powerful, and they complement each other so harmoniously, they survive the director's lack of talent. The messages of individual freedom, the arbitrariness of power and personal responsibility somehow escape from the camera's dull stare. Whether as a fictional portrayal of an era and place rarely seen in cinema, as a morality tale, or as a work of art, The Lives of Others is an achievement of the highest order in modern cinema.",8,1,1,13 January 2012
The Man Who Would Be King," An Overlooked Masterful Epic
","The Man Who Would Be King is one of the finest epics ever made. John Huston was no stranger to stories which explored the darker aspects of the human psyche, and borrowed Kipling's short-story to weave a tale about greed, arrogance and above all friendship.Michael Caine and Sean Connery, during the best period of their careers, play two former British soldiers who make their living as con-men throughout Her Majesty's mighty empire, hatching daring plans and getting out of scraps with panache. One day they decide to travel and conquer Kafiristan, a land visited only by Alexander the Great. Their plan is bold: to cross the mountains, survive the winters and the raiders; defeat the local tribes with modern weaponry and then unite all tribes under a single nation.It all looks pretty sound until Daniel (Connery in one of his best performances) starts believing the local legends that me may be Alxander the Great's son; power goes to his head and, like in a Greek play, he brings about his own demise.The movie is equally funny, adventurous, sad and epic. There's never a dull moment in it, thanks to the great script full of amusing dialogues and thanks to the great performances by Caine and Connery. Endlessly watchable and unforgettable, The Man Who Would Be King is the movie anyone should watch when their looking for a way to have a good time.",10,3,7,31 May 2009
Gran Torino," The Angel of Death Becomes the Guardian Angel
","Clint Eastwood hasn't disappointed since Mystic River. I've seen all the movies he's made since then, excepting Flags of our Fathers, and I always walk out of the cinema in awe at the talent of this man. Simplicity, good writing, a powerful story, and strong performances are the tools he uses to craft unique films.In Grand Torino Eastwood graces us with one of his performances. I've always considered him an under-appreciated actor, and I don't think he's improved with age: he was great as early as the old Sergio Leone movies of the '60s. In this movie he plays Walter Kowalski, a widower enjoying retirement in a neighborhood which has been occupied by Hmong people. Bitter at life, and feeling abandoned by his family, he can't help throwing racist epithets at them; but this is clearly a defense mechanism to keep people away from him.Slowly he befriends two siblings living next to him and even starts acting as a father figure to them, including to Thao, a confused teenager who's being courted by gangs. Walter, a Korea War veteran, thinks he can fight violence with violence, and things only escalate from there to an unpredictable conclusion.If this be Clint Eastwood's final performance, it'll be perfect. He makes a 180 degree turn from his famous tough guy persona. In Unforgiven he played that persona as if on steroids, making William Munny the most vicious angel of death in the West. But Walter Kowalski is an older, wiser man who knows violence leads nowhere. His final solution to Thao's problem is an amazing send up of his man-with-no-name and Dirty Harry characters.Complementing Eastwood's directing and acting is the usual clever dialog, especially between Walter and his friend Martin (John Carroll Lynch in a lovely role), the melancholy music by Kyle Eastwood, and the tight editing that leaves out everything superfluous. This is a little gem of a movie, which deserves to be cherished by film lovers forever.",8,2,7,8 April 2009
The Hurt Locker," Seeking Thrills in War
","In The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal explore war from a new perspective, imagining it as a drug and the soldiers as adrenaline addicts seeking thrills in their dangerous missions. Mind you, I didn't get this interpretation from watching this movie. A quote kindly explains that war is a drug at the beginning of the movie. Looking back, all my problems with this movie started here. You can't really trust a filmmaker who has so little faith in his viewer that she has to spell everything out for him in the first ten seconds.My second complaint is that this movie fails at being the character study that it presumes to be. A study presupposes an analysis. The object of study is Sergeant William James (played by Jeremy Renner), a soldier freshly arrived in Iraq, whose mission is to diffuse bombs. James is always getting himself into needless dangers. Now a character study would try to explain why this man is obsessed with risking his life, in opposition to his colleagues, who want to get out of Iraq in one piece. It'd try to get into his mind or analyze him from several perspectives. It needn't give an explanation (I don't think anyone can truthfully explain why a man would be addicted to getting into danger), but it should do more than merely give the viewer a superficial portrayal of the character.Compare James to Lawrence of Arabia (to talk of character studies in war), the most mysterious character in the history of cinema. David Lean analyzes him from every angle possible, basking in the contradictions of his personality, only to reach at the conclusion that Lawrence will always remain an enigma. But at least he tried to understand him.The Hurt Locker merely jumps from one scene to another. Boal's screenplay is very episodic. There is no story from A to B, like in other 2009 movies like Inglourious Basterds or Up. This is a good choice since it shows the hectic nature of James' existence in Iraq.Renner gives a good performance. I discovered the actor in this movie and I'm sure he has a pretty good career ahead of him. He plays an everyman, with little heroism in him and a lot of familiarity; he's the sort of person you could know from school or the office. I think this quality was the most important thing he needed to capture in the performance of this man who doesn't know why he's addicted to danger.Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty also contribute with fine performances as James' team colleagues. Mackie in particular stood out and I found myself enjoying his character a lot more than Renner's. James is a pretty unpleasant guy. How unpleasant? So unpleasant his colleagues contemplate blowing him up at one time.There are also three short roles in the movie that deserve mention: Guy Pearce playing the Sergeant James comes to replace; Ralph Fiennes as a mercenary tracking down terrorists in the desert; and David Morse playing a Colonel fascinated with James' dumb bravery.The Hurt Locker is a strange movie: I didn't dislike it, but I finished it thinking I hadn't watched anything great or too memorable. Perhaps it's because it lacks a traditional narrative structure, but I just don't see a lot of content in it. Otherwise it's one of the best movies released in 2009: the cinematography was pretty great, one need only compare the contrast in colors between the Iraq scenes and the scenes with Jams back at home. The editing was pretty good. I've seen people complain about the use of hand-held cameras in the movie, how everything shakes in the movie and how annoying it is, but I actually found it quite steady most of the time and noticed that the scenes took their time to develop.I also enjoyed the use of silence in the movie. Marco Beltrami was nominated for an Oscar for his score, but it's so subtle I hardly noticed it at all. Instead most of the movie benefits from lack of music, and the silence only makes most of the scenes tenser.Although it's not the best movie of 2009, I can see how this movie slowly made it to everyone's top lists and how it's getting all awards. Bigelow and Boal deserve a lot of praise for having tried to do something different.",6,0,4,16 February 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Ode to Superficiality
","Some people argue that there isn't anything most boring than a revenge story. It's really nothing more than someone going around killing people in escalating violence, and with paper-thin characters. Kill Bill certainly reinforces that perception.Uma Thurman plays a super-assassin who's betrayed by her former teammates on the day her wedding. After years in a coma, she wakes up seeking nothing but revenge. And for more than three hours of movie (I'm already including vol. 2 - God forbid vol. 1 actually had 3 hours!) what follows is repetitive action involving martial arts and swords.Of course Quentin Tarantino is up to his usual gimmicks, so we see everything out of order and he inserts little stories in the main story in a poor attempt to flesh out uninteresting characters.The tone of the movie is silliness combined with austerity. The characters' every action - whether talking or walking - is in a slow, very composed manner, full of solemnity, like they're doing something really deep. But then they're one-dimensional shadows, so everything they say is rubbish no matter how disguised it is with wanna-be philosophy. Everything is fake and unconvincing.Only Tarantino's camera work is interesting in this movie; the way he crafts a fight scene is really amazing, I'd even say epic. Unfortunately he's not designing videogames.I guess people who watch Kill Bill will get exactly what they know they will: superficial fluff with 'cool' lines and characters, and lots of violence. I'm sad to say I want more from my movies.",5,1,2,9 September 2009
The Adjustment Bureau," Romantic, funny, but didn't meet my expectations
","George Nolfi's directorial debut delivers a lot in terms of acting, little in terms of innovation, and demonstrates that at least he knows how to put together a movie. The Adjustment Bureau, supported by a solid cast, flows with little bumps but leaves its major weakness for the finale.Matt Damon, who has given a string of good performances lately, doesn't disappoint in his role of David Norris, a politician running for Senate. Watching him are the agents of the Adjustment Bureau, the people who make sure things run according to plan. They have monitored Mankind since its dawn and have the mission of taking it to a brighter future. David matters to them because his path through life can lead to great improvements. Unfortunately they fail to make a small adjustment in his life and he meets a ballerina called Elise (Emily Blunt). It seems that by being with her, David will never feel the need to fill the emptiness of his life with politics and so she must be removed so he can pursue his career. But David, who discovers their existence almost by chance, is determined to fight the bureaucratic embodiment of fate to be with the woman of his dreams.As I compare the good and the bad in this movie I'm left convinced that there is more to enjoy about it than there is to complain about it. But sadly complaints exist. Let's start with the agents. First of all I love the fact that the AB isn't the typical super-secret omnipotent organization. The agents are blunderers like your average public functionary; they're not good with improvisation (too used to rules and rigid plans), and they're overworked. If Richardson (John Slattery) is to be believed, they're paid. But they're probably underpaid. They're just guys doing their job and it shows in their personalities.But the agents suffer from what afflicts typical super-powerful bad guys: vaguely-defined powers. They can freeze people in time, but they never use that on David once in the movie. They have telekinetic powers but they never make much use of that either. And those fedoras they use? Knock them off and you depower the agent. Incidentally, one of the most hilarious scenes in the movie is when David gets hold of one of those magic fedoras. 'Sir, he has a hat!' cries a panicked agent. This movie is not without its delightful levity.Although the screenplay is weak when it comes to defining the agents' powers, it's surprisingly strong during the seduction/flirtation scenes between Damon and Blunt. The lines the two leads exchange overflow with wit, charm and tenderness, and convince the viewer that their love truly is special and worth challenging the power of fate for.The rest of the cast delivers solid performances: Michael Kelly; Anthony Mackie who plays Harry, an agent who goes rogue to help Damon's character; Slattery, who brings some deadpan humour to the movie; and Terence Stamp, who plays Thompson, the main antagonist, the agent who's called when all other agents fail.The movie is technically good. It's worth noting that the director of cinematography in charge is John Toll, whose past credits include The Thin Red Line and Braveheart. The movie is well shot and possesses stylistic coherence. I guess at some point someone must have asked: how do we transmit the idea of the vastness of an omnipresent organisation monitoring the whole world? Of one single man fighting it? The movie is mostly shot in widescreen and vertical lines (the gigantic headquarters of the AB in Manhattan), and most scenes take place in huge, long, empty halls and corridors. There's a feeling of magnitude in the movie, a feeling that Mankind is very small thing and that something powerful looms over it.The special effects and editing also do a fine job of keeping the movie fast-paced and exciting. One of the many powers the agents have is their ability to teleport through doors. Imagine you open a public bathroom door and you end up inside a football stadium. The agents use this power to move faster than other people and it's arguably the most ostentatious display of visual effects in the movie. Otherwise the movie is very subdued.Much has been made of the conflict between free will and predetermination life in the movie. That's the philosophical question that holds it together. But I personally found something more interesting to chew on. There's a dialogue between Thompson and David about the AB existing to lead Mankind to a better future. When they stepped down during the apogee of the Roman Empire we had the Dark Ages. After the AB stepped down again in 1910, we had WWI, WII, the Holocaust, you get the picture. Without them we're screwed.Let's put aside that the fact that things weren't so great during the Roman Empire (slavery, no rights for women, brutal wars, deranged emperors, etc.), and that a lot of great things were invented between the two world wars. The movie also ignores the morality of the AB agents' actions. We deposit our power in the hands of politicians because we hope they will know how to make good decisions for all of us. It's out decision to do so. No one's voted for the AB, but in the context of the movie they haven't really done anything harmful to Mankind, in fact they're keeping its destruction at bay, barely. Bur is it OK for them to decide the lives of others or not? That's a question worth thinking about, I believe. I don't think the movie even imagined people asking it, so casually does it throw it into the air and then forgets it, unlike the clichéd free will vs. determination dilemma, over which the movie takes a clear stance in favour of free of will, of course. This is something I wish the movie could have explored.",7,1,1,13 January 2012
The Insider," Beautiful Portrait Of The Human Condition
","Michael Mann has made one of my favorite modern movies: The Insider is everything I expect to find in a movie. Time has not treated it well, it was completely overlooked at the Oscars and has been sadly forgotten in recent years in detriment of more catchy 1999 movies like American Beauty, The Sixth Sense, and Being John Malkovich. I don't understand why: The Insider is a masterpiece with great production values and quality; its screenplay is engaging, it depicts the human condition with intelligence, maturity and tenderness; one can feel Jeffrey Wigand's frustrations and anger, cry over his personal problems, rejoice in his battle for the truth against tobacco companies; he's one of the most complex and complete characters because of the way Mann balances his feelings with his many flaws; he's not perfect, but for his sacrifices and losses throughout the movie, I believe he's one of the best heroes in recent American Cinema, of the same stuff Atticus Finch and Will Kane are made of.Mann's great achievement is picking up a slice of life and turning it engaging: Jeffrey Wigand, former CEO for tobacco company fights for the public's right to know the truth about this industry. It seems rather dull, but Mann focuses on the everyday consequences of his actions, marital arguments, divorce, restraining orders, possibly jail. The Insider really shows ordinary people caught up and left alone in cruel, extraordinary situations and that makes great drama to watch! I find fascinating how far the tobacco companies will go to stop Jeffrey from saying what he knows, the threats to his family, the psychological blackmail; CBS's fear of airing his interview is their last gambit and it was fascinating to watch the backstage functioning of a big network, the discussions between the top people that the common man is unaware of, their daily fear of litigations, and the efforts of good journalists like Lowell Bergman to show the truth.Russell Crowe plays Jeffrey Wigand, a man torn between exposing the truth and keeping his mouth shut to protect his family and their well-being; it's not even physical aggression he fears, more things that are in most people's minds: how will he pay the mortgage on the cars and house, who will put food on their table, how will they pay college? Jeffrey's a high-middle class guy and his greatest fear is how his actions will hurt his family economically. It's something many people can relate with. Crowe is brilliant in this role, to me it's his best one to date; without many words he manages to convey several feelings and emotional states just through body language, facial expressions and small mannerisms and ticks. He never tells directly what's on his mind, but he shows it with great clarity. Jeffrey's major flaw is his lack of social skills to deal with emotional situations; he's always hot-headed and gets angry easily, and his failure to communicate with his wife, Liane, when she's not coping so well with his problems, lead to abandon and divorce. Diane Venora is great at playing Liane, it's easy to find her rather cold and uncaring for the way she abandons Jeffrey, but I think her character was well-written as a wife who tried to stand alongside her husband, only he didn't want her support: Jeffrey had it coming on this one.Al Pacino is also fantastic as Lowell Bergman, a 60 Minutes journalist who fights against CBS to air his interview with Jeffrey so his efforts and personal tragedies weren't in vain. Pacino steals the last third of the movie in this quest, overshadowing Crowe's performance. I feel he should have gotten a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his strong performance. The movie's climax is beautiful, and one of the most cathartic moments in cinema since Andy Dufresne's escape in The Shawshank Redemption. I love the song 'Sacrifice' playing while the interview is finally being aired as the camera keeps cutting to several characters in the movie as they all watch it on TV. It's a feel-goody moment because everyone wants Jeffrey's efforts to be worthwhile and not just in vain. More importantly, being it based on a true story, it's not just mindless happy ending to please crowds: it's the truth, and it should remind all these people who hate happy endings because they're 'unrealistic' that, yes, there are happy endings in the real world too! The music is beautiful in this movie  I love 'Iguazu' playing when Jeffrey is on his way to a court to testify against the tobacco companies. 'Meltdown' is another beautiful song. Mann is a great filmmaker: his use of camera angles is always refreshing and his cinematography is just visually engaging. The Insider, to me, deserved to have swept several Oscars: Best Picture, Director and Actor. I'm not sure about Best Adapted Screenplay, The Talented Mr. Ripley had a best one in my opinion. As things stand, both movies were ignored in 1999 by the Academy. It's something I regret but changes nothing to me: The Insider will always remain as the best movie of 1999 to me.",10,1,2,20 February 2005
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The Love Story of the New Millennium
","Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman have crafted the best love story of the new millennium so far. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind tells the timeless tale of falling in and out of love, of meeting one's kindred soul and of overcoming adversities in the pursuit of happiness. But the filmmakers tell it in a mind-bending, mixing everyday emotions with elegant plays on time, narrative and memory.Jim Carrey, in one of his best performances, plays Joel, an everyman who discovers his unstable, unpredictable, but captivating girlfriend, Clementine (possibly Kate Winslet's best role) has just erased him from his memory through a new scientific process invented by Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson). In revenge, he decides to erase her too. But as the process unfolds, he realises that even his most painful memories are a treasure worth cherishing; so in his mind, he fights the process.In spite of all the fantasy in this movie, I don't think I've ever seen a relationship so well portrayed in cinema. Joel and Clem aren't just characters, there's something very familiar in them, which any viewer can find in themselves. They're imperfect, impulsive, sometimes unlikeable. But nevertheless love finds a way through them.Kate Winslet was spectacular in her role, but Carrey is the real surprise. Every once in a while he surprises people with a great performance: The Truman Show; Man On The Moon. He plays grief, tenderness and shyness so well in this movie I wish he'd get more dramatic roles.Few movies are as emotional and honest like The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Many love stories come from Hollywood, with their perfect love stories, where everything turns out well; but this is the rare movie in which love has but a temporary victory so it must be enjoyed while it lasts, in which downbeat ending can still be uplifting. How is that possible? I guess that's why Gondry and Kaufman are hailed as geniuses.",10,3,6,12 May 2009
Taken," Liam Neeson as an Action Hero
","Taken is one of the most fast-paced action thrillers I've seen in a long time. It's 93 minutes of non-stop action, suspense and thrills as an ex-secret agent rages through Paris looking after his daughter, kidnapped to be sold in the sex industry.Liam Neeson shows that, at the age of 57, he can surpass such characters as James Bond and Jason Bourne as the best, coolest, deadliest action hero of modern cinema.Artistically speaking, Taken is not a great movie: the camera work and dialogue is unimpressive and the characters are as developed as they need to be to make the movie move on (Neeson's characters has a wide range of skills that pass off as characterisation). Movement is the major force behind this movie, its frantic pace never letting the viewer stop to think for a moment. But whereas I would despise that in a movie like Transformers, some quality in Taken makes me love it.It's undoubtedly the story that makes the difference. Whereas most summer action movies are huge stories about nothing, Taken is a smaller, simpler, even heartwarming story about a father's love for his daughter. We sympathise with his loss and rage and rejoice in the pain and destruction he inflicts upon the villains.This is escapist cinema at its best; I haven't been this thrilled and haven't cheered so much for a hero in such a long time, I felt I'd never again experience the joy of watching a good guy triumph in a movie. Fortunately movies like Taken keep getting made.",7,2,3,10 September 2009
Chariots of Fire," A Great Feel Good Movie
","Chariots of Fire is a simple, feel-good movie. It certainly won't make into the cinema history books. Technically speaking, it's average. Director Hugh Hudson has a firm understanding of how to shoot a scene. The screenplay by Colin Welland is possibly the best aspect of the movie. With the help of a great cast - Ian Holm and Ian Charleson deserve special credit for their performances - this is a well-accomplished drama about a group of athletes competing in the 1924 Olympics.The conflict here is between Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Cahrleson). Harold is a Jew who finds in sports a way of fighting against racial oppression. Eric is a priest who believes God has given him the gift of running and so he runs to honor him. Each character is fascinating. Each has a good reason to run, and the screenplay explores how their passion affects their personal lives. Harold is obsessed to the point he ignores everything else, including love and friends. Eric wonders whether he's not putting his personal glory before God's.Ian Holm plays Sam Mussabini, a trainer who prepares Harold for the Olympics. One of the best aspects of the movie are the running montages. Editor Terry Rawlings crafts each montage in a different way. Especially good are the opening titles of the British team running on the beach, an iconic sequence, and the training montage which shows the distinct way Harold and Eric train. Harold is a methodical man, he has a scientific approach, a personal trainer. But Eric simply runs on the high hills of Scotland, like a possessed man, showing his communion with God.Vangelis' classic score can't be ignored either. You'd think a synth-heavy score would be unsuitable for a period movie, but it's one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever created for cinema.In the end, Chariots of Fire is a movie made to leave people satisfied. Only an insensitive won't cheer at the triumphs of everyone in this movie. Watch it and rejoice.",8,1,1,11 April 2009
Invictus," The Inspirational Movie of 2009
","Invictus shows Hollywood doing what it does best: inspiring true stories. These days I don't expect much from Hollywood. But at least Hollywood hasn't yet lost its touch to inspire and leave the viewer upbeat. Invictus works very well as a movie so long as the viewer comes prepared to leave feeling hopeful, inspired and cheerful about life.Invictus is a completely traditional piece of film-making. Every angle is predictable; the storyline develops the way we expect. Every character changes in a predictable direction, the movie even ends without surprise – in triumph, of course, as befits an inspiring true story.As much as I love Clint Eastwood, he's nothing more than a good director of little dramas. He'll never set cinema on fire like Polanski or Scorsese. But that also means that there's probably no one better suited than him to direct a story about Nelson Mandela, a man who has been inspiring people for decades.Invictus shows us Mandela taking charge of the South African presidency after decades in jail. His country is a mess in just about every sense. One of the problems he has to deal with is the social division between whites and blacks. Democracy may have prevailed, but you don't change decades of racial conflicts and prejudice with laws. So whites and blacks continue to hate each other. A point of conflict between the two groups is the rugby team Springboks, which during Apartheid was a symbol of white supremacy. Now the blacks want to end the team, but Mandela sees in it a way to unite the country. His idea is to use the Springboks to win the Rugby World Cup in order to bring the country together in celebration.This is an interesting portrayal of Mandela, showing him as a political manipulator, although for benevolent reasons. He's no fool and he realises that the whites, though a minority, still own most of the country's economy. Also they love the Springboks. So it wouldn't be too intelligent to end the team. I for one wish the movie had continue in this morally ambiguous line, but this is an inspiring true story after all, and there's nothing more dispiriting in our times than politics.What we have are inspiring speeches and many exciting rugby matches, and wide shots of crowds celebrating, all the way to its predictable conclusion. And I won't deny I didn't remain inspired and hopeful and optimistic and radiant for a few hours after watching Invictus. And then I remembered South Africa is today considered one of the most dangerous places on Earth.Morgan Freeman shines as Nelson Mandela and I don't think anyone deserves the Oscar for Best Actor more than him. He doesn't just capture Mandela's accent but also his mannerisms; watching Freeman was like watching Mandela at times. I don't have any idea who François Pienaar is or looks like, but I loved Matt Damon's performance too. Whether he was faithful or not, I honestly I couldn't care since I loved every scene he was in it. Kyle Eastwood's score was pretty good, but not as good as the ones he made for Letters of Iwo Jima and Gran Torino. These are scores I enjoy listening once in a while, but the one for Invictus I feel only works in the context of the movie, especially in the rugby scenes.Invictus was one of my favourite movies of 2009, it's a lovely drama conscious of its purpose and limitations and thankfully doesn't try to rise above them.",7,1,2,3 February 2010
Life Is Beautiful," The Light-Hearted Holocaust Comedy The World Needed
","Life Is Beautiful is Roberto Benigni's simple and unpretentious comic masterpiece about the Holocaust. It's also one of the most wonderfully manipulative movies ever made, one that lulls the viewer into a sense of security and joy before introducing him to a terrifying story about altruism and the price of love.The movie contains in fact two stories: one follows the lovable Guido falling in love with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a schoolteacher, and using his humour and imagination to win her heart. The first thirty minutes of the movie are a lovely homage to classic cinema, in the way it sets up countless gags that are later pulled off with whimsical and hilarious results, and with perfect timing. There's a lot of physical humor in the movie that reminds one of the old silent comedies.After the viewer has fallen in love with Guidio and become intoxicated with Guido's love for Dora, the movie turns a darker turn and details how Guido and his young son are sent to a concentration camp. For Guido is a Jewish, as the movie stated from the start. It seems an insignificant detail at first but it changes Guido's life forever.In the camp Guido, using his endless imagination, convinces his son that they were sent to a fun camp where they have to earn points working and performing special tasks to win a tank in the end. Guido loves his son so much he wants to spare him the truth about the world's horrors.This movie has been much criticised for trivialising the Holocaust, I claim I couldn't care less about. Art is not beholden to matters of good taste. In fact, as Rabelais, the father of the modern novel, has shown us, art is full of vulgarity, blasphemy and humour. Why should cinema be any different? This movie is pure invention, a ridiculously simple version of the relationships between prisoners and between prisoners and guards. But in its fiction it's closer to novels, which always start from invention too, and by being invention it manages to speak about themes that transcend a mere account of Holocaust reality. What this movie has to say about father/son love, the price of altruism, and the power of imagination is the stuff of high art.Roberto Benigni is excellent in all the roles he had in this movie: as an actor (he much deserved his Oscar), as a director, and especially as a screenwriter, whose ability to invent gags and comic situations was remarkable. He only didn't provide the music; that was accomplished by Nicola Piovani, who also deserved his Oscar. Like all manipulative filmmakers, music is 90% the manipulation, and Piovani provides all the upbeat and dreamy and melancholy themes that make Life is Beautiful a heartbreaking experience.",10,3,5,17 February 2010
Up," Animated Excellence
","It's become a tradition for me to go watch the latest Pixar movie when it comes out. This studio is the only one I trust enough to always blindly go to their movies. There's no greater cinematic injustice than wait for the DVD.Movies like Up keep rewarding me for such loyalty. In this movie, we meet Carl Fredricksen, a 78-year-old man who decides to fulfill a pledge he made to his wife when they were still children: to visit South America. Their lives pass by in bliss, but without their dreams of adventure fulfilled; but when she dies and Carl faces loneliness he comes up with the most hilarious plan to make his dreams come true: he ties thousands of balloons to his house and just flies away.By chance he receives an unwelcome guest: Russell, a 7-year-old boyscout trying to earn an elderly assistance' badge. Although the boy is initially an annoyance to the grouchy Carl, eventually the two become great friends and teach each other valuable lessons.Like every Pixar movie, the story and characters are the main draw of the movie. Sure, the animation is spectacular, but which mega-studio can't get the same animation Pixar can? On the other hand, the screenplays Pixar comes up with are always simple but beautiful, not to mention excellent at visual storytelling. Wall-E was practically a silent movie; and even if there's quite a lot of chit-chat in Up, it's the ability to express ideas and feelings in images, which can be comprehended by children and adults alike, that make it so fascinating and heartbreaking.",8,0,1,25 August 2009
Rosemary's Baby," Madness and the Devil
","Roman Polanski's classic Rosemary's Baby remains not only one of the best horror thrillers I've ever seen, but one of the greatest movies. In the horror genre, one needs to watch The Exorcist to come across a movie that matches the quality of Polanski's masterwork. The more one peers into the past, the more one comes across good horror movies. For all their tameness by modern standards, the truth is these classics are better written, plotted, acted, paced and scored.The story is by now universally known, having seeped into popular consciousness in all sorts of parodies, homages, spoofs and imitations. Let it just be said that the use of demons and the Devil has seldom been so well used in cinema. Again, one must watch The Exorcist, or perhaps its knock-off The Omen, to see it so it used with novelty and artistic quality.Mia Farrow plays Rosemary in a very seductive way, that makes it impossible for the viewer not to sympathise with her from the start. She's such a good-natured, happy woman that it's more tragic when she becomes the target of evil forces trying to control her and her pregnancy. John Cassavetes plays her husband, Guy, an apparently average joe, who's darker than she ever imagined. Ruth Gordon plays a chattering, busybody neighbor, a seemingly harmless old lady, secretly scheming against the innocent Rosemary.Polanski was at the top of his game in 1968 and directed this movie in a very elegant and innovative way. For instance, the movie is bright and colorful. When Rosemary and Guy arrive at their new apartment in the Bramford building, it's a desolate, sinister place, evocative of countless haunted houses of the past. But then they remodel it and it becomes a light, pleasant place to live in. This is one of the many departures from old movies, the idea that horror can happen in the most mundane places, by the most vulgar people.The score is harmonious and peaceful, with a lullaby as the main theme; it's a far cry from the distorted garbage that poisons so many horror movies today. Rather than highlighting the tension, it lulls the viewer into a sense of peace and safety. It's wonderfully manipulative, as horror should be.The story develops at a rational place, slowly building on the strangeness around Rosemary, introducing her to a secret world that isolates her from any help. Rosemary grows more helpless as the movie goes on, and it's a joy to watch Farrow descend into terror and despair little by little. I think this was a major improvement on his previous movie, Repulsion, in which Catherine Deneuve's character always seemed a bit crazy from the start.Although Polanski reached the zenith of film-making with Chinatown, that perfect gem of cinema, Rosemary's Baby stands as one of his best efforts and remains enjoyable and innovative after several decades.",10,1,3,14 February 2010
There Will Be Blood," Best Movie of 2007
","I write this review rejoicing over the fact Daniel Day-Lewis has received the 2007 Oscar for Best Leading Actor. I wish the movie had won more: not having seen No Country For Old Men yet, I rooted for There Will Be Blood all the way. There hasn't been in recent memory a movie that has excelled on so many levels: the writing, acting, editing, cinematography, score, and art direction are just perfect. And on top of technical perfection, this movie is infinitely enjoyable.With a runtime of 160 minutes, it's incredible how two hours and a half pass by just like that. There Will Be Blood is violent, funny, heartwarming, and absurd. It grabs you and doesn't let go; there are just too many things to hold your attention: Day-Lewis' superb acting as Daniel Plainview, a self-made, ruthless oilman determined to have everything. Helping Day-Lewis was an enviable cast, including Ciarán Hinds, Dillon Freasier and Kevin J. O'Connor. Emphasis goes to Paul Dano, who delivers a performance on par with the one in Little Miss Sunshine. His role as Eli Sunday, an evangelist who struggles to manipulate Plainview for his divine crusade, is great! The conflict between Plainview and Eli throughout the movie is a treat to watch: two equally ruthless men with a craving for power, each trying to have the upper hand over the other. Needless to say the conclusion is bloody.Then there's the dialogue: I savored every line, every conversation, every speech, every outburst by Plainview. There are entire dialogues that you'll never forget. If Paul Thomas Anderson deserved an Oscar for this movie, it was for the screenplay.Helping the movie is also Jonny Greenwood's eerie score: I don't know how to explain it, but every time one of his tunes was played, it just took the movie to another level. And then we have Robert Elswit's Oscar-winning cinematography. His work impressed me for its use of unusual angles and long takes, turning small scenes in the movie suspenseful and unique.The Academy wasn't kind to There Will Be Blood. However I don't think Anderson's movie will need many Oscars to stand the test of time. Day-Lewis' performance is enough to grant it a place in history. But this is a cinematic masterpiece, on the same league as Letters of Iwo Jima and City of God, to be enjoyed in the years to come by millions of film lovers.",10,1,6,25 February 2008
Downfall," Cruelty Has A Human Face... And Great Actor Behind It!
","I haven't been so enthralled in a movie in a long time! Der Untergang was the last of the great 2004 movies left for me to watch after enjoying Million Dollar Baby, Vera Drake and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. After eagerly waiting for it to premiere in Portugal, I've finally seen it and it's as brilliant and beautiful as word of mouth would have one believe. Oliver Hirschbiegel, an unknown director to me until now, made what is to me one of the best movies in many years and easily one of the best gems of last year. I can't think of anything negative to say about it.Technically, it's outstanding; it recreates the wrecked, chaotic Berlin of 1945 with as much accuracy and attention to detail as The Pianist recreates the Warsaw Ghetto. The beauty of the sets doesn't restrict itself to the open city but also to disturbingly clean, anti-septic scenes of Hitler's underground bunker, bathed in a bluish, pure light that contrasts bitterly with the horrors happening outside this fantasy world the dictator created for himself. The art directors should be commended along with the directors of photography. The sound in this movie is also another great aspect: the explosions, bombings, gun fires find their way into the story seamlessly; the bunker dwellers might be having a party in one moment only for a bomb to explore right next to them ruining their futile attempts at pretending everything's alright outside the bunker. Their downfall becomes more real to them as the sound of the Russian artillery keeps getting closer and closer, heightening their despair and runaway attempts. Only Hitler remains frighteningly calm amidst all this panic. I feel Der Untergang is a movie that was inexplicably short-changed on a lot of Oscar nominations.I have no complaints from the cast either: most actors were unknown to me, except Thomas Kretschmann; and I didn't even know he was in the movie until I saw the poster at the theater. And yet everyone was brilliant in their particular roles; some were relatively short and others occupied a large bulk of the movie, but everyone was perfect! Obviously Bruno Ganz's unique performance will always overshadow anyone else's, but worthy of note are Alexandra Maria Lara, who plays Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary who has a very touching relationship with the dictator; Christian Berkel, as an SS officer whose main concern is helping the civilian population when all the higher powers abandon them; Michael Mendl, playing General Weidling, who sees the madness of continuing to resist the Russian army's impeding advance; and Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels, a truly haunting performance as the man who keeps feeding Hitler with dangerous fantasies about victory even when defeat is obvious to everyone.But it is Bruno Ganz who gives the performance of the movie: forget Clint Eastwood and Jim Carrey for their two fine performances in 2004; and do forget the overrated Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio. Bruno Ganz gives one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. Ganz isn't just performing; he is really Adolf Hitler! He embodies with perfection the mannerisms, body language, voice of the tyrant! With a remarkable make-up that further transforms his semblance into Hitler's, Ganz completely transforms himself for this role. I've only seen Ganz in another movie before, a European co-production called In The White City: I hated it and hated Ganz. I never imagined only one year later I'd be praising this same actor. This isn't the Bruno Ganz of In The White City; this is one of the best modern actors playing his art to new heights! It's not easy to make Hitler a compelling, fascinating, and even human character; it's actually very easy to make him the inhuman monster, the raging, babbling lunatic we would like to think he was. But Ganz played Hitler with chilling complexity and that made the dictator look even more monstrous. It only makes this man look even crueler and callous when we admit he was also a man who loved playing with his dog, or enjoyed listening children singing to him, held polite conversations with people and liked to stroll. When one takes all this in it becomes more chilling how such a man could have given orders to kill millions. All his excuses are finally gone. I hope Bruno Ganz is proud of this role; I imagine it wasn't easy, but it's a treat for movie lovers. And again, one feels he was criminally missing at the Oscars.Der Untergang is around 150 minutes long and remains entertaining until the end. The only reason I was looking at my watch sometimes was because I wanted to know how much longer I could be enjoying this experience; I just didn't want it to end. The story is interesting enough as it shows what's happening inside the bunker in the last days of the Reich. Although there's a cast huge enough to rival a Robert Altman movie, the movie never loses narrative coherence: it's always about Hitler and how Hitler's madness and growing weakness alienates many of his followers and just forces others to make interesting decisions; the political machinations, the back-stabbings, the plots, the desertions, the suicides are all result of this one central figure. Particularly chilling is the scene in which Magda Goebbels kills her six children with poison, then dies with her husband in suicide.One of the best movies of 2004, Der Untergang is a fantastic cinematic experience. One shouldn't leave this movie for DVD rental, it needs to be enjoyed on a big screen for full effect.",9,5,10,22 April 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The Best Dracula Movie Ever
","Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula is the most ambitious and technically-impressive adaptation of Bram Stoker's much adapted novel. It's the only version I know which keeps the epistolary structure of the novel: letters, diaries, logs, newspaper clips, etc. form the complex narrative of the movie. I think it's also the one that tries to put so much of the novel's original plot in the movie.Visually, it's a feast. Particularly impressive are Eiko Ishioka's Oscar-winning costume design, which produced medieval armors unlike any I ever saw and the Count's long, brilliant costumes. The make-up also has an important place in the movie, considering they had to age a 34-year-old Gary Oldman into a vampire who seemed older than time itself. It's the best horror make-up after The Exorcist's. The art direction turned Victorian London and Transylvania into sinister places: whether it be a derelict castle full of rooms, or a madhouse, the sets are always heavy with dread.And then there's the cinematography. As much as the novel was about different types of writing, this is a movie about different styles of film-making. We have scenes that evoke old German Expressionist movies; we have scenes that seem like they were shot with an old 19th-century camera. Coppola uses the iris in/iris out technique, and even uses fast-motion, and makes it look good.Much has been said about Keanu Reeves' poor acting, but what does that matter when he's barely in the movie, and when the movie focuses mostly on Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins? Bram Stoker's Dracula is not just a great adaptation of the novel, it's a great movie, and arguably the last great movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola.",9,0,2,4 May 2009
The Mission," Spiritual
","Imagine a time when two empires could split the world in two, one half for each country to rule, as if the globe were an orange. This in fact happened in 1494, with the Treaty of Tordesillas, mediated by the Vatican, in which Portugal and Spain, then world empires, agreed to split the newly discovered territories outside Europe along a line of longitude. This treaty gave Spain control of most of South America, with the exception of Brazil, which Portugal kept. Then in the 1750 Treaty of Madrid, Spain agreed to give Portugal the territories west of Brazil, encompassing what is today the country's territory. With two world empires deciding the fate of colonies as if they were lifeless pieces on a chessboard, it's no surprise that a lot of people ended up suffering the consequences. The Mission is the movie about those people.The movie follows the lives of three people: Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons), a Jesuit missionary who goes to live with the Guaraní tribes in the Amazonian jungles to convert them to Christianity but defends their right to self-rule; Rodrigo Mendonza (Robert DeNiro), a slave trader in search of redemption for the murder of his brother; and Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally), a Vatican envoy. He comes when Father Gabriel asks the Vatican to protect the Spanish missions established in the territories. These missions have prospered and are examples of Christian communities. Transferring them to Portuguese territories would destroy them, since under Portuguese law slavery was allowed and the Guaraní would serve as a cheap labour force. Altamirano, although humbled and marvelled by the achievements of the converted Guaraní, who have constructed churches capable of competing with their European cousins, is forced by duty to decide in favour of the Portuguese, in the name of the good relationships between the Vatican and the European powers. The film concludes with a dramatisation of the Guaraní War, in which the tribes resisted the invaders until joint Spanish-Portuguese forces crushed them in a bloody massacre.If for nothing else, I love this for having given Ennio Morricone the opportunity to compose the most beautiful film score in the history of cinema. Is it strange to admit I only saw this movie because of the score? The truth is, many movies I only watch to listen to their scores. As an avid film score collector, I listen to most scores well in advance of watching the movies. Every once in a while I listen to one that makes me think, 'Well, this is really great! Let's see how it works in context. Maybe the movie didn't butcher it too much.' Well, the movie didn't butcher this one. Maybe the score is just too magnificent for that. In any case, the moment the first notes of 'Falls' are heard, in tandem with the crushing sound of an Amazonian waterfall, it becomes obvious Roland Joffé understood how to put the score at the service of the story.This interest in the music isn't redundant. The Mission is a movie driven by sounds, music and images. It's not a traditional movie driven by plot or even characters, although I find the trio well developed, especially where their moral consciousnesses are concerned. Robert Bolt, the two-time Oscar-winning screenwriter of Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago and A Man for all Seasons, wrote the screenplay, his final one. Bolt, a renowned playwright in his own right, at the age of 61, was still experimenting with his style. Sergio Leone-like minimalist dialogues is not something one associates with the poetic, fast-paced witty dialogues of 'Lawrence' and 'Seasons,' but Bolt managed to write a very visual screenplay, very different from his previous masterpieces, where actions define characters more than witty words.Consider for instance the character of Rodrigo Mendoza. Catching his brother with his wife, he kills him in a fit of rage. Then he delivers himself to the authorities. When Father Gabriel meets him in prison, he's a dejected, broken human being. Gabriel offers him the possibility of atonement, to work with him in the missions, where he can help those he once exploited. How does Rodrigo show his penance? Well, the easy way out would be for a tear-jerking speech full of wise, clichéd truths (and if someone could pull that off, that person would be Bolt). In the movie, however, Rodrigo travels with Gabriel back to the mission. It's a journey that takes weeks, through thick jungles, mountainous terrain, and up waterfalls. Rodrigo has tied around his waist a net containing his heavy armour, symbol of his former live. It's the burden he carries. It delays everyone, but he stubbornly pushes it after him. It falls, he goes back for it. And when he arrives, at the end of this unforgettable sequence, at the mission, an Indian cuts off the rope and throws it into a river. Then Rodrigo breaks down crying in a mixture of sadness, relief and joy his new life beginning.Wordless sequences such as this wouldn't be half as powerful, however, without seasoned director of photography Chris Menges helming the camera. For his work on the movie, he won an Oscar. He had previously won one for The Killing Fields.Back in the '80s, The Mission was part of a short-termed interest in South America: the interference of the US government in the continent, reflected on its open support for dictatorships, was becoming more and more evident. However, whereas most movies, like Salvador and Under Fire, dealt with contemporary events, few tried to show the origins of these conflicts in their historical context as the results of centuries of European colonialism. Only The Mission and Alex Cox's Walker took a different path, exploring the past to better explain what was going on in the present. As such, the movie is not just a fine period drama but a sensitive history lesson too.",9,4,5,13 January 2012
The Reader," Love, Literature and the Holocaust
","Using post-war Germany as its settings, The Reader is a fascinating exploration of guilt, responsibility, love, shame, the power of the past and the loss of innocence; it's a very complete portrait of Mankind, with its darkness and light, its love and cruelty.Fifteen-year old Michael Berg (David Kross) meets Hanna Schmitz. A relationship develops. For Michael it's entering the world of sex; but for Hanna it's the birth of something more special. For the time they spend together, Michael is obliged to read aloud to her. During a summer they live a strange relationship of sex and literature. Then she moves away without notice.Year later, Michael, a law student, travels with his teacher and colleague to witness a trial in which six female concentration camp guards are being judged. Hanna Schmitz is one of them. This is only the beginning for Michael of discovery which will change the way he saw the innocent days when he read to Hanna.I've come to expect nothing short of technical and visual excellency from the collaborations of director Stephen Daldry and screenwriter Richard Hare. Billy Elliot and The Hours were two amazing dramas in which human relationships were at the center of the action, and The Reader is no different. Kate Winslet pours everything she has into the secretive, weary-looking Hanna. It's a great performance (but not my favorite) by this generation's greatest actress.Ralph Fiennes unpredictably also gives a great performance, standing in as the older Michael Berg, whose reminiscences are the bulk of the story. He's a man obsessed with the past, unlike Hannah, for whom 'the dead are still dead.' David Kross is also good. He portrays a fairly innocent kid who slowly discovers the cruelty and unfairness of the adult world. He sacrifices everything for the afternoons with Hanna: friends, family. His feeling of betrayal is quite visible in the courtroom scenes.It's also worth mentioning the joint cinematography of masters Roger Deakins and Chris Menges. It's pretty easy to spot which scene was shot by whom, so different are their styles. But even their differences work for the movie's benefit, with Deakin's bright colors in the outdoor scenes contrasting with Menges' dark interiors.The Reader was one of the best movies of 2008 and well worth watching.",8,3,4,13 April 2009
The Wrestler," Brilliant, Funny, Heart-Breaking
","I had so many prejudices against this movie I almost missed it: a Micky Rourke movie, a wrestling movie. How could I enjoy such a combination? Well, word of mouth thankfully won me over and managed not to miss one of the most hearth-wrenching, beautifully written, directed and acted movies of 2008.The movie is as brilliant as it's simple: Randy The Ram Robinson is a washed out wrestler whose time of glory was in the '80s until an epic fight that ended his career. Now he works on weekends for the independent wrestling circuit. He's adored wherever he goes by fans and young wrestlers who seek his approval. But during week days, when he's outside the ring, he has to deal with the fact he's a loser who works odd jobs at warehouses, goes to strip clubs for some action, is despised by his daughter and still obsesses over his career, as seen by the posters on his trailer, the action figures in his van and '80s Nintendo video game that stars him and which he asks neighborhood kids to play with him, although they'd prefer better video games like Call of Duty 4.Darren Aronofsky has crafted a beautiful, depressing, cynically humorous movie about the pitfalls of self-obsession and vainglory. His seamless camera work complements the simple but effective screenplay by Robert D. Siegel, which reveals humanity at every word. Rourke shines as The Ram, a role that no doubt only an actor who once had glory could have played so effectively. When I saw the poster for this movie, with the presumed 'ressurection' of Micky Rourke, I felt like laughing. Now I wish he'll do film lovers a favor and continue giving such performances forever.Shinging alongside Rourke is Marisa Tomei, an actress who can stay under the radar for years and then comes out of nowhere with a stunning performance. Here she plays Cassidy, a stripper whose real name is Pam when she's not in the club and is busy being a mom. She's Randy's double, an aging stripper who knows she's past her prime; but unlike The Ram, she has plans for the future. Tomei plays her with sensibility and subtlety. Credit should also go to Evan Rachel Wood for her small role as Randy's daughter, Stephanie: she's in some of the most heart-breaking scenes of the movie as she deals with Randy when he decides it's time to connect with the daughter he abandoned a long time ago.I can't really find faults in this movie, nothing that diminished my enjoyment of it. This is a simple, brilliant little movie, a great drama without being over-dramatic, humorous without being stupid and human without being sentimental. One of my favorites from 2008.",9,0,0,2 March 2009
Inception," Nothing New In This Dreamworld
","Like many people anxious to watch Inception, I spent many hours online reading news, watching trailers, and just sharing my enthusiasm about it. Then I began reading weird rumours about the film involving time travelling (it doesn't) and other potential spoilers, and I decided it was time to get away from the hubbub and wait for it in isolation. I wanted to watch the film as purely as possible. I only allowed myself one treat; I didn't resist listening to my beloved Hans Zimmer's score in advance. I never imagined my feelings about the music would reflect my feelings about the film. I expected an exquisite delicacy and instead got a steak with fries. And afterwards I was still hungry.By now word of mouth has taken all the secrecy away from the story, so let's be brief about it. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, the leader of a criminal crew that infiltrates the minds of people during their sleep to steal their ideas and sell them. After a botched assignment, Cobb and his partner, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt), are hired by Saito (Ken Watanabe) to do the reverse: instead of stealing an idea, they must implant an idea in a victim's subconscious, implant it so deeply that he won't doubt it came from himself. The victim is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the heir of an energetic mega-conglomerate that threatens to have monopoly over half the world's energy supply. The idea is to convince him to dismantle this empire. For this epic assignment Cobb hires the architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), the forger Eames (Tom Hardy) and the chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao).Inception has the best ensemble cast I've seen so far this year. That doesn't mean it has the best acting – I think that honour still goes to Shutter Island, which had heartbreaking performances by Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio himself. But the viewer can be sure that a film that contains all the talent mentioned above plus Marion Cottilard plus cameos by Michael Caine, Lukas Haas, Tom Berenger and Pete Postlethwaite, is at least captivating on account of all the charisma walking in and out of the screen every two seconds.I think the film needs all this charisma to satisfy because it doesn't offer much else in terms of entertainment. One of the greatest crimes a film that takes place in dreams within dreams within dream within dreams (yes, you counted it right), can be accused of is being visually dull. Anyone who saw the trailer has nothing else to look forward to, it's all there: the zero gravity hallway fight scene, the city folding, the snow power station attack, the collapsing urban landscapes. The film only expands on the trailer, it has no other impressive scene. Any artist worth his salt only uses dreams as a theme if he wants to show something visually interesting. Dreams aren't held by physical laws; they're limitless, strange, threatening. In Christopher Nolan's world, however, I can see stranger dreams if I just look outside my window.Christopher Nolan is not a particularly inventive filmmaker. There's no visual exuberance in his films. I noticed this when he turned Gotham City, a wonderfully Gothic and oppressive landscape in the Batman comic books, into a replica of any American city. Midas' touch turns things into gold. But Nolan's touch turns uniqueness into banality. Not even dreams are safe from him. Defenders will rise to say that the realism of the dreams is the point. But then why dreams? Who makes a film about Mozart to ignore his music? Many will also say that Inception is a strange film. That's arguable, of course. It's ambiguous enough to allow several interpretations. But it makes sense most of the time. Good writing and good editing contribute to that. I think this is also what made Nolan's previous attempt at a mind-boggling film, The Prestige, so satisfying. He's a fair director. He takes time to show everything the viewer needs to know to understand what's going on, and the film's rhythm is slow. Inception is strange in the sense that other mainstream, but quirkier than average, films are called strange, like The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's strange in a very limited way, custom-made for audiences that have been deprived of strangeness for so long that they can't recognise it anymore; it's a strangeness that hardly brings dignity to the true strangeness unleashed by Wojciech Has' The Hourglass Sanatorium or Jan Svankmajer's Faust.This banality applies even to the action. There are directors who've revolutionised the way action is filmed: John Woo, the Wachowski brothers, even Michael Bay. But Inception, with the exception of the inventive hallway fight scene, leaves much to be desired. Car chases and gun fights play out much the way we expect, with little elegance or imagination.Inception's saving grace is that, for an action thriller, the main character is far more complex and engaging than usual. Cobb is a man tormented by past horrors, separated from his children, running away for a crime he didn't commit. When he enters dreams his subconscious takes the form of his dead wife, Mal (Cottilard), always ready to foil his plans. Cobb isn't just a cool thief but a man trying to get his life back and DiCaprio makes him effortlessly sympathetic.I don't know why, but I feel bad for not liking Inception more. Cinema certainly needs ambitious films that mix intellect with action; that dare to be unique while being familiar. Inception is a respectable failure, in my view, but is a step in the right direction. I hope at least it inspires other filmmakers to move in the same direction.",8,7,14,6 August 2010
Prometheus," Pretty visuals in search of a good story
","Prometheus managed to get me very excited: from the trailer I expected an intelligent, gripping, visually splendid science fiction movie like we haven't seen in a long, long time. Well, I got the pretty visuals, but Prometheus is a movie in search of sensible characters and an intelligent plot.Two archeologists discover a star map on a cave painting and from such scarce evidence infer that Mankind was created by aliens, which they call the Engineers. They convince Weyland Corporation to finance a trillion-dollar expedition to the planet to search for alien life, filled with incompetent geologists and botanists who never heard of basic health procedures. At this point the movie basically becomes a remake of Alien - ships lands on alien planet, scientists find alien complex, strange things creep them out, people get infected with aliens, a double-crossing android (brilliantly played by Michael Fassbender, one of the movie's saving graces) manipulates the crew, people fight aliens, etc.Most of what you see in this movie was already in Alien, all the way back in 1979, and the new ideas aren't particularly well developed. I'm sure an interesting movie about aliens creating mankind could be made, but Sir Ridley Scott and Damon Lindelof aren't up to the task. Most of the movie's problems come from the script: characters do bizarre, irrational things all the time - people with state of the art digital maps get lost in straight tunnels, scared scientists try to pet visibly hostile alien creatures; people with almost no information make incredible assumptions - Janek, the ship's commander, who never leaves the ship, out of the blue claims that the aliens were building biochemical weapons. There's an absurd twist halfway that introduces a new character in a very silly way. Alien, let's be clear, didn't have brilliant characters and the dialogue was so-so, but their personalities were well-defined and they were instantly compelling. Most of the characters here were loathsome and I was hoping they'd all die violently.As a stand-alone movie Prometheus is a disgrace. But it's even worse what it does to Alien; basically it cheapens it by destroying the wonderful mysteries it kept for decades. I don't think the world ever needed to know who or what the Space Jockey was, we were all better off finding our own solutions in our imagination. But Scott must hate people using their imagination. He and Lindelof must also hate their because they came up with a dull explanation for him, not to mention he changed his bizarre look. The original Space Jockey was gigantic, this one is almost the same of a human. Although they're not the same character, since Prometheus takes place in another movie, I really want to see what explanantion - if any - they're going to find to there being two Space Jockeys of different sizes.Besides Fassbender's excellent performance, this movie has excellent special effects, sound design and cinematography. The opening shots are beautiful and the visual inside the alien compound are very good, even if they're not up to H.R. Giger's.I expected more, I was anxious to love this movie.",5,9,14,19 June 2012
RED," Last Year's Best Ensemble Cast Saves Mediocre Movie
","Red. Was a better ensemble cast put together last year just for laughs? Oh sure, there were great ensemble movies last year, but most gave the feeling that they just wanted to get Oscar love. Some succeeded (The King's Speech), some failed (Another Year). But I don't remember a movie where a group of excellent actors got together just to have some fun. There was The Expendables, but no one really considers Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li great, right? They're nowhere near the league of Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, Jon Malkovich, Mary Louise Parker, Richard Dreyfuss, Ernest Borgnine, and Brian Cox, who all lent their talent to Robert Schwentke's mediocre action comedy and made it one of last year's sleeper hits. And let's have no doubts: Red is nothing but the triumph of its cast of veteran actors, who are so good they brought magnificence to a screenplay that had nothing. Logic gets shell-shocked amidst the explosions, cool one-liners define shallow personalities, and as for the plot holes, how can they exist if there isn't a plot anyway? The more I think about Red, and I've been thinking about it since around last Christmas, the more its flaws stand out like big pustules on a forehead and the less I care. This is not a movie to look for mistakes or to complain about plot holes. This is a movie of simple, guilty pleasures: Malkovich behaving like a paranoid conspiracy nut, Helen Mirren mowing bad guys down with a Gatling gun, etc. We know we want to watch this, right? Based on a comic book by Warren Ellis and Cully Hammer, Red stars Bruce Willis as Frank Moses, a retired CIA hit-man targeted for assassination because some journalist started investigating an operation that happened decades ago and that no one remembers anymore. But Moses was part of that operation and someone wants to eliminate all the witnesses and people connected to it. This has been done to death. Let's move on. A team of hit men turns Moses' house into a Swiss cheese, but he gets rid of them with the gracefulness that only Willis can muster when playing an action hero. Next he gets on the road with Sarah (Parker), a woman he meets on the phone when he calls the government pension processing centre. She's the only person he can trust, they're in love, etc., tick the romantic subplot box. What's next on the list? Moses needs someone to help him, so he contacts the rest of his crew that was involved in that vague operation that happened a long time ago: the LSD-soaked paranoid Marvin (Maklovich), Joe (Freeman), living in a retirement home, and Victoria (Mirren), who still takes hit jobs because old habits die hard. Their plan: kill their way through a conspiracy that involves the US Vice-President and the military-industrial complex. It's a big, nonsensical plot that, just for nostalgia's sake, hearkens back to simpler times when South America was teeming with CIA black ops and the Cold War still existed. A 'realistic' thriller by Paul Grengrass this is not.Red has absolutely nothing new in terms of ideas. It brings nothing new to the genre. Red has slick, self-aware action sequences. Characters perform humanly impossible feats like gracefully sliding out of a car in movement or hitting an incoming rocket with a revolver. The movie asks us to ignore this and we happily do because we don't want to ruin the fun. But in the back of our heads we keep telling ourselves that we've seen this approach to action countless times in any movie starring Jason Statham.What the movie really has in its favour is the superb cast, whose familiarity eliminates the need for character development. They have the personalities we expect from their type-cast screen personas. We all know Willis will play a super-duper, cool as ice tough guy with a heart of gold. Malkovich does his creepy-crazy thing he did so well in Con Air. Freeman, that serene narrator, is the voice of reason. And Mirren is the personification of upper-class grace with a gun and killing instincts. She's a Bond girl if Bond girls lived to retirement age.The actors just feed off each other, their chemistry is spotless. Even if Malkovich steals every scene he's in with his paranoid antics, everyone works to complement someone else. What we get is a movie full of hilarious interrelationships which prodigiously mask the countless flaws of direction and lack of originality in the screenplay. Watch it, have fun with it and then don't think about it ever again.",6,3,5,16 February 2011
Cube," Horror Movie with Good Art Direction
","Vincenzo Natali's Cube is a formulaic horror movie playing with the famous premise of getting strangers in a mysterious situation and see how they interact. It's Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None (I wanted to use the original title, but sadly IMDb believes in censoring certain words). Except instead of a mysterious man killing people who got away clean with murder, we have a mysterious cube killing people for no apparent reason.This pointlessness and randomness seems to be an element of high rating for its fans. It seems people like pointless movies more than I imagined. The complete indeterminacy (we're far beyond the level of ambiguity here) of the nature of the cube has generated more theories than the 17,000 cube rooms that constitute the Cube.The Cube is just a well-paced, suspenseful horror thriller with an art direction better than most horror movies (with the possible exception of Dario Argento's colorful '70s movies). I marvelled at the design of the cube room, its deadly traps and the shots of the outer shell.The characters are just one-dimensional figures going wherever the plot require them to go. Too many clichés abound, especially the one I most despise - the bad guy who seems dead but returns for one last scare.As an exercise in keeping the viewer on edge, this movie wins. Otherwise it's a one-time-only experience.",6,1,2,13 September 2009
Sin City," Modern Noir Masterpiece
","'Sin City' is the most enjoyable movie I have seen so far this year, whether on DVD or at the theater. Roberto Rodriguez and Frank Miller have made one of the most entertaining and emotionally satisfying movies of modern times. The story is told with raw intensity from the beginning to the end, constantly surprising the viewer with the next fantastic, unpredictable twist and conclusion. It's a movie told in mosaics, three distinct stories with their own protagonists and antagonists, beginning, middle and end, and with some marginal connection. In the end, though, it's almost always the same story: the lone tough guy on his personal crusade for love against the powers that be. Miller seems to love a specific type of male character  they always come as streetwise, macho, violent men with their emotions on their sleeves and inflexible, twisted morals, capable of doing anything for a dame. The women came in as more diversified, but they're still pretty much the archetypal femme fatale from noir tradition. If this looks like Miller can't come up with different characters or that he is merely repeating himself, that's not my point. In fact, Marv, Hartigan and Dwight are three of the most distinct, fascinating characters I've seen in a good while. They're all born from the same basic source of creativity  namely noir tradition that Miller so much loves  but each story is different and unique on its own! The story that more impressed was Marv's segment. Mickey Rourke, in one of his finest roles ever, gives life to a violent, brutish and uncompromising tough guy bent on revenge. Marv is a walking anachronism, his raw brutality, frankness and values are completely incompatible with modern society  and I think he acknowledges that at the end of his segment. When the only woman of his life is mysteriously killed, Marv turns Sin City upside down looking for the killers until he reaches the core of power and corruption controlling the city. The resolution is unpredictable but also the most realistic. Miller and Rodriguez didn't cop out here, and I praise them for their courage. This story is the most violent of the three, pretty much on account of Marv's presence, and also has the most colorful characters of the movie  Wendy and Goldie, Cardinal Roark, the psychotic cannibal Kevin. Elijah Wood was unrecognizable as a young killing machine that devours his victims. As corny as this may seem, the truth is Miller and Rodriguez makes it work with chilling beauty! The second segment was my least favorite; it was still enjoyable and had some of the best acting of the movie thanks to Benicio Del Toro's performance as Jackie Boy: his scenes with Clive Owen inside the car were so funny! Owen is good as Dwight, as regular and nice guy as Sin City could allow it: like Marv he gets in trouble for women, only this time he's fighting to keep someone he loves alive. It's a twisted story featuring a colorful gallery of characters, from a scantily-dressed army of dangerous prostitutes to Irish mercenaries, to Manute, it's a fun ride full of ecstatic violence and action: the final showdown on the rooftops of Old Town Still was impressive, but it still left me emotionally cold.Now the last segment  the 2nd best to me  was the most emotional and heartbreaking of the movie! Bruce Willis gives the best performance of the movie as John Hartigan, a rare thing in Sin City: a decent, hard-working cop who fights corruption and the powers that control Sin City, namely Senator Roark and his son, Junior. This is to me the most complex story of the three: Hartigan saves a young Nancy Callahan from child rapist and serial killer junior when she's only 11 years old. Hartigan knows he's getting in trouble going against the Roark, but for him saving a young girl in exchange for his life is a fair trade. He saves her, but what comes next is the most twisted revenge story ever! Senator Roark makes sure Hartigan is charged with raping Nancy and he goes in for eight years. Everyone abandons him, his friends and family, thinking he's a sick pervert. He accepts it all very well: telling anyone the truth would imply their deaths. So he takes his punishment in silence. Now one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when young Nancy visits Hartigan at the hospital to thank him; she knows he's being framed and is powerless to help him, and Hartigan tells her to never see him again. Their only contact during eight years becomes the letters she sends him every week. But when the letters stop coming, Hartigan knows something's wrong and takes action. What follows is one of the most satisfying stories I've seen in a while as Hartigan gets his revenge, but it's also the most depressing as his inflexible values force him to do something extreme to save Nancy Callahan, now 19 years old, from Roark's wrath. The ending is just heartbreaking and yet it's the only possible conclusion.Accompanying the three stories is the always superb cinematography: mostly black-&-white, sometimes with some bits of color to make contrast, and always visually impressive. The score is memorable and the dialog is Oscar-worthy! The acting is not always great, but the characters are so strong one forgives that.Putting it simply, Miller and Rodriguez have created a modern masterpiece!",6,3,6,1 July 2005
Moon," Well-Made Science Fiction Drama
","Duncan Jones has created a science-fiction movie that doesn't bask in visual effects and that puts action aside to meditate on human nature. Like Stanley Kubrick, of whom he's an aesthetic heir, the centre of his story is Mankind. I applaud the realism of the settings and costumes, the way he captured the isolation and tedium of the astronaut life. And I watched in awe the way he captured the craters of the moon, the star-filled skies and the distant Earth. From a technical and visual perspective, this is one of the most gorgeous explorations of life in space since 2001: A Space Odyssey.Sam Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut living on a Moon mining base. His three-year contract is about to end and he longs to return to his wife Tess and daughter Eve. His only company has been the patient and benign computer GERTY (a friendly version of HAL). But it's when he's about to leave that he starts seeing things and his existence on the base comes into questioning.Without wishing to give much away, I can only saw the movie starts addressing questions of memory, reality and individuality. Although I expected a more metaphysical story, Moon's story is actually very mundane, I'd even say crude. The story itself ended being my least favourite aspect of the movie. At times I found myself guessing whole scenes minutes before they happened, which does not bode well for a movie built on mystery.What I loved was Rockwell's performance, Kevin Spacey's voice as GERTY, the sets and costumes, the cinematography, and especially Clint Mansell's beautiful score. Duncan Jones has shown a lot of potential in Moon and I don't doubt in a few years he'll grow to become a great filmmaker.",7,1,4,17 November 2009
Born on the Fourth of July," Remarkable Oliver Stone Movie!
","Perhaps no other North-American director has done so much to tell the truth about the Vietnam War than Oliver Stone. Coppola created the breathtaking Apocalypse Now, and Michael Cimino created my favourite The Deer Hunter. And yet those movies, I think, set out to tell an abstract, universal story about war that could fit any war  WWII, Vietnam, The Gulf, etc: war is hell. But Stone's earlier Platoon was perhaps the first great movie that explored the relationships between American soldiers in Vietnamese soil born out of the circumstances they found themselves in. I don't believe Platoon could have been told with WWI as the backdrop  especially because the movie is based on Stone's personal experience in 'Nam.And Born On The Fourth Of July yet again explores an intrinsic aspect of the Vietnam War: the veterans' homecoming. Stone takes his time setting up the story: at the beginning he shows the viewer a WWII veterans' parade in young Ron Kovic's town being received with warmth, respect and admiration. A clear contrast is made later in the movie in Kovic's parade wherein anti-war protesters try to disrupt the parade. Stone thus visually shows peoples' attitude towards the two wars: the former was accepted and supported with patriotic zeal; the former divided a baffled America which didn't accept its government's lies nor couldn't understand the point of the war.The beginning of the movie is pure foreshadowing in itself, as young Ronnie and his friend play soldiers in the woods and is ambushed and 'killed' by his friends. Stone sets this scene to immediately show the sort of patriotic, army-worshiping, 'tough' kid Ronnie is, and to foreshadow his tragic incident in Vietnam. Even as a kid we can see Ron Kovic is a complicated person: loved by his parents but having a domineering mother watching over him, filling his head with patriotic nonsense against the 'communist evil,' he becomes a rather dysfunctional kid: look at his behaviour when Donna kisses him; he gets on the ground and starts doing push-ups what? Is that supposed to impress her or he can't just interact well with women? Considering the Bible-strict family he comes from, it's no wonder. There are even hints that Ron's mother is somewhat ashamed of him: her expression when he loses the wrestling match seems to imply she finds him a loser, and her artificial goodness when Ron returns from the Vet's hospital in a wheelchair says the same. It's like she's embarrassed.Although the movie is consistently good  except for the Mexico segment, in my opinion  it becomes really great after Ron returns from 'Nam. The Veteran hospital segment is just brilliant: we're shown how the veteran soldiers were dependent on uncaring, disrespectful warders who couldn't care less about the 'Nam; we see the awful conditions these soldiers were treated, with lack of money, resources, material; we see the soldiers being treated inhumanly and just craving some respect and dignity or at least that's their viewpoint. The truth is, most of them think they deserve the moon and the stars just because they went to some foreign country kill babies in the name of freedom but the warders can see just past through that nonsense and treat them like the ordinary people the veterans think they're not. I particularly love the scene where one warder tells Kovic that the Vietnam war is a rich man's war, and the true war is being fought in the USA, at the University campuses, for civil rights and equality. That's how disconnected from the real world Kovic is, that he sees the war his government dumped on him through his blind patriotism, but neglect what's really going on. And his staying in the hospital is a real eye-opener.Truth be said, Ron Kovic never changes  although there's a superficial transition in the movie from Vietnam War apologist to anti-war protester, the fact is Kovic is characterised from the first scene as a man who only wants to do what's best for the country he so much loves; and at one point that means defending the Vietnam War with weak arguments  how can you defend sending young men to die miles way from home, anyway?  but as Kovic slowly matures he realises protesting against the war is really defending his country, even if it means being called traitor, beaten or arrested. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Kovic invades a Nixon convention and speaks to a journalist how the American government has lied to its people and convinced an entire generation of young men to die for nothing, and then dozens of people try to reach him to beat him up, spit in on or just insult him. It's a poignant scene because of Kovic's raw words and John Williams' always emotional score. The uplifting ending is just the cherry on the top for what is an otherwise amazing movie about human nature triumphing in the worst of conditions.",8,0,1,25 March 2005
The Social Network," The Social Network That Ruined A Friendship
","The irony of the creation of Facebook, the social network that brings people together, is that it destroyed a great friendship. At least that's the way David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin tell the story of Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, the two friends that started Facebook. As the famous social network comes to life their friendship deteriorates until it becomes a lawsuit. It is this dramatic situation that makes up most of the movie and it's why The Social Network is one of the finest movies of 2010.The movie starts at Harvard, in 2003, as Mark (Jesse Eisenberg) is breaking up with his girlfriend, Erica (Rooney Mara) because of his aloofness and inability to realise when he's hurting peoples' feelings. It's a fast-paced scene, exciting and a preview of the whole movie: Mark has a serious deficit of social skills and will drive his loved ones away.Then we jump into an exciting montage which, amidst booze, daydreaming and revenge blogging, shows Mark inventing Facebook's ancestor, the puerile Facemash, which allows users to rate the hotness of college students. Mark invents what will become Facebook after getting dumped by a girl and trying to get some revenge on the entire female species (keep track of the ironies, the movie is full of them).The success of Facemash leads the brothers Winklevoss (Mike Hammer and Josh Pence) and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) to invite Mark to create HarvardConnection for them, a social network exclusive to Harvard students. The premise is that chicks just love Harvard men. Mark accepts but then gets a better idea and, with the financial support of his friend Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), starts working on Facebook instead, while keeping the Winklevoss thinking he's still working for them, a mistake he'll literally have to pay for later.The movie shifts back and forth in time, in one of the best editing works of the year, seamlessly weaving two lawsuits and Mark and Eduardo's past story together in an exciting narrative. One is the lawsuit the Winklevoss file for intellectual property theft, and the other is by Eduardo, for being cut out of the business he helped create. Bit by bit all the events leading up to this fall into place until they form an incredible story about friendship, ambition, greed, backstabbing and loneliness.There are three great things going for this movie: first of all, the casting. It's a pleasure to see so many fresh faces on the screen. Most of the actors involved haven't had great roles yet. But like the characters they play, I think they'll become successful overnight.Secondly, the actors are very good. Eisenberg, Mara, Hammer, Minghella. Justin Timberlake surprises in his performance as Sean Parker, the infamous creator of Napster. And Andrew Garfield steals every scene he's in.Eisernberg delivers a fine performance, walking the tight line between a deliberate moron and a clueless egotist. He portrays so well Mark's ability to hurt peoples' feelings without realizing it, that could almost believe Eisenberg is just like that in real life.Timberlake plays a man with a chip on his shoulder, a drug-addling paranoid entrepreneur who must be the center of all attention, a man who is, as Eduardo so aptly puts it, cooler than a million dollars. Smooth talking, friendly, he's also a self-destructive lunatic who coaches Mark in the cynical world of businessmen and uses him to boost his own ego.Garfield plays a man with his feet firmly grounded on the world. He's a businessman. He invests money and expects profit. He wants to monetize Facebook. Mark doesn't. In comes Sean Parker who says just what Mark wants to hear and proceeds to turn him against Eduardo. Eduardo represents everything Sean hates, the businessmen who screwed him in previous businesses. Eduardo is slow to realize that he's becoming isolated. But his response is amazing. 'You best friend is suing you for 600 million dollars' must be one of the best lines of the year.Finally there's Aaron Sorkin's dialogue. Sorkin is one of the best screenwriters alive, even if he doesn't write much for movies. Watching Charlie Wilson's War in cinema seems like something that happened a long time ago in my memory. But it's worth the wait. Sorkin has the monopoly on fast-paced, witty dialogue. All his characters speak in a vibrant, clever, entertaining, endlessly quotable way, while retaining their individuality.There's not much to say about David Fincher's directing, except that I never felt I was watching a David Fincher movie. He's directed a lot better and he can direct a lot better. It was a long time ago when I watched Se7en and fell in love with cinema. That was a visually beautiful movie. The Social Network merely gets the job done. Except for some neat montages, there's nothing really spectacular about the visuals of the film. Fincher shoots every scene in the easiest and most predictable way possible, as if he's anxious to wrap things up and move on to Stieg Larsson's adaptation, which hopefully will look like a proper Fincher movie.Trent Reznor's awful electronic music doesn't do the movie any favors either. Every time I had to endure more noise from Reznor's ugly synthesizers I remembered the lovely version of Radiohead's 'Creep' played in the trailer. It's not good when trailer music is more exciting than a film score. But that's sadly becoming a trend.All in all, The Social Network is a very watchable character drama about the destruction of a friendship disguised as a biopic. I say disguised because of all the liberties taken with the facts. That's probably for the best. How exciting could the truth about the invention of a social network be new anyway?",8,1,2,14 November 2010
The Birds," The Coming of the Birds
","Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds is one of the most elegant exercises in the creation of suspense, tension and terror. The story is deceptively simple: a wealthy young lady pursues a love interest to a remote little town. And when she arrives strange, unexplainable bird attacks start happening.Using a story by Daphne Du Maurier, Hitchcock creates terror from the most unlikely source: common birds, these peaceful creatures that flee from us and avoid us; in this movie they become, by their sheer number, a dangerous force of evil that attacks people randomly and without purpose.The movie's story is very similar to the work of a forgotten but amazing fantasy writer, Arthur Machen, who wrote a novel during WWI about the animal kingdom declaring war on Mankind. What distinguishes both works is that Hitchcock never suggests a reason for this change in the natural order.The movie is constructed with the typical Hitchcockian fare: immediately likable characters, comic relief, and an understanding that what he's doing is complete fiction and not a realistic representation of anything. Hitchcock made movies to entertain, and this movie is very entertaining.Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren are very good in their respective roles, but I'd argue that this movie is not about human relationships but how people function in situations of tension and terror, and with the unexpected and the implausible.The cinematography here sometimes reaches unimaginable heights of creepiness: one need only look at the shots of the birds peacefully standing on phone wires or roofs, looking at the viewer demurely, without giving any indication if they're going to attack or not. So much of the dread of this movie comes from the anticipation, from waiting something bad to happen because we're constantly waiting for it. There was no one like Hitchcock to manipulate the viewer's emotions.47 years later, The Birds remains a very good thriller, with excellent special effects, and with a never-ending sense of dread and doom that will leave the viewer thinking for days how such a small change in the order of things could disrupt human life so entirely.",10,3,6,17 February 2010
All the President's Men," One of the best in the genre
","1976 was a magical year for cinema: Scorsese's Taxi Driver, Bertolucci's Novecento, Bergman's Face to Face, Polanski's The Tenant, Zurlini's The Desert of the Tartars, Bozzetto's Allegro non Troppo. No doubt many other masterpieces came out that year, but although I can't remember or know them all, there's one I'm not likely ever to forget: All The President's Men.The seventies were being a good decade for Alan J. Pakula: he had already made two excellent movie, first the crime drama Klute (1971), for which Jane Fonda got her first Oscar, and then the paranoid extravaganza The Parallax View (1974), still very entertaining, and gorgeous to look at thanks to Gordon Willis' cinematography. The Parallax View starred a journalist (a brash performance by Warren Beatty) trying to untangle a vast governmental/corporate conspiracy that involved brain-washed assassins. His next movie, as a way of conclude this loose trilogy, was also a story about journalists uncovering a conspiracy on the higher echelons of government – what makes it infinitely more disturbing is that it is all true.No one should have to live in a world where it's perfectly reasonable to write that this movie is about two journalists thwarting the sinister machinations of corrupt American President Richard Nixon, but we're not to blame if truth more often than not looks like a rejected Jamed Bond plot. Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford give extraordinary performances (Redford especially; Hoffman is undoubtedly a greater actor, so it's more exciting when Redford admiringly holds his ground against him) playing Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, two journalists for The Washington Post who investigate the Watergate break-in and slowly unravel a presidential conspiracy that, in time, would lead to Nixon himself. Around them is a cast of some of the best actors from America's past and some still going strong nowadays: Jack Warden, Hal Holbrook, Jason Robards, Ned Beatty, Jane Alexander. The movie was written by William Goldman, and many of the crewmembers were regular Pakula collaborators: David Shire on the music, bringing adding his chilling and minimalist style to the atmosphere of the movie, and DP Gordon Willis lighting and framing each frame with the usual artistry that he displayed in The Godfather trilogy.All The President's Men is an intelligent, slow-paced but tense political thriller that honours the best done in the genre – this may well be America's response to Costa-Gavras' superb Z (1969) – and that has left a mark too on all that followed – think of The Insider and State of Play, for instance. This movie pretty much helped codify the language and tropes of things we expect to see in movies of this type – journalists fearing for their lives, a non-cooperative government, night conversations in dark garages, leaked documents, the inner workings of newspapers. There's nothing clichéd here, though, each scene and trope still has vitality not only for inventing them in the first place but for setting such a high standard for imitators.",9,1,1,10 April 2013
The Fighter," Christian Bale Saves Predictable Movie
","Boxing movies are predictable. Drug addiction movies are predictable. Inspiring true stories are predictable. My next sentence is very predictable: The Fighter is annoyingly predictable.But it's an enjoyable movie. Storytelling clichés aside, The Fighter triumphs as a heartbreaking movie about family relationships. When it's focusing on the protagonist and his large dysfunctional family it provides some of the best dramatic scenes of any movie this year. The filmmakers must have known that because they thankfully keep the boxing almost in the background in order to tell a very human story.Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a boxing fighter with a low reputation. Coached by his crack head brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), a former fighter and a local legend in their hometown of Lowell for once having knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard, he sees the years fly by as he fights in crappy matches that get him money but don't get him anywhere near his dream of having a shot at the title. Dicky and their mother (Melissa Leo), who acts as Micky's manageress, are, to put it mildly, incompetent in the way they manage his career.Dicky has a serious drug addiction problem and can't see reality in front of him. This is made obvious when he lets an HBO crew make a documentary about him. Dicky claims they're filming his comeback, but in fact they're doing a piece on crack addicts. Dicky is too stoned most of the time to realise in Lowell people consider him a loser.Micky's mother, Alice, worships Dicky. Dicky is always the centre of attentions. As the movie develops Micky deals with his self-esteem problem and finally finds the courage to break away from his mother's good-intentioned control and to move from under Dicky's shadow.The Fighter entertained me but I never had the impression I was watching a great movie. A good ensemble of actors helps hide the fact that the direction is uninspired and the writing and storytelling clichéd. In fact some clichés just got on my nerves. I see them so often in boxing movies that I feel they should just put a moratorium on this genre until a super-screenwriter comes up with a new model to tell this type of stories.Cliché number one: the inspiring speech at the end. We all know how the final fight plays out, right? We visualised it in our minds two hours in advance. We've seen the Rocky movies, Cinderella Man, Million Dollar Baby, even movies with Jean-Claude Van Damme. The protagonist is getting devastated by the opponent, he's giving up, but then he remembers something inspiring someone tells him, and bam, some massive surge of energy springs from within the deepest corner of his soul and it turns the tide of the fight in two seconds. It's a Knockout. We have a winner! Boring.Cliché number two: the final opponent is always a jerk. Now Micky is the protagonist, we're supposed to like him, of course. But we've been liking him for almost two hours now. Must we really demonise his opponent, some guy called Shea Neary? Micky is a nice, polite dude. What about Neary? He's rude, he doesn't greet Micky in the ring. OK. Look, we already like Micky by now. We've already laughed and cried with him. We really want to see him become world champion. He could deliberately run over a dog and we'd still want him to win at this point. Turning the movie into a simple good vs. bad fight is futile. In real life Neary was probably just like Micky, he just wanted to fight box and win the title. Now is it too much to ask the filmmakers to respect my intelligence and not assault me with these third-rate ploys to win my sympathy? But as I said, when the movie isn't about boxing it's very good. Christian Bale steals the show with his portrayal of Dicky. Famous for his physical transformations and superb accents, Bale just disappears into his characters. He's one of the rare actors who doesn't need make-up. His performance is full of vitality and little ticks – he's so good he can capture the viewer's attention just with the fidgeting of his hands or the twitching of his eyes. Loud and electric, Bale plays the most interesting character in the movie. As warm as Micky's triumph may be, what I really loved was to watch Dicky fighting his addiction.His addiction results in the best sequence in the movie. Dicky has been arrested. He's in prison. The crack documentary is showing on TV. He watches it with a crowd of inmates. Alice watches it with Dicky and Micky's sisters. Micky watches alone at home. Dicky sees the people of Lowell calling him an embarrassment and accusing him of giving the town a bad name. It's devastating, moving and cruel at the same time to see each family member, glued to the TV screen, reacting in their different way to it.Micky's arc isn't nearly as interest or poignant but Wahlberg does a fine job. Yes, he's the weakest link the movie but his unpretentious, down-to-earth acting works in his favour when portraying such a simple and likable guy like Micky. More disappointing were Melissa Leo and Amy Adams, whom I expected at any moment to reveal the reasons why they earned Oscar nominations for this. Their greatness, however, if they had any, eluded me.Even with its seven Oscar nominations, I doubt in a few years anyone remembers The Fighter except Christian Bale fans. 2010 will definitely be remembered as the year of the overrated movies.",7,2,3,25 February 2011
