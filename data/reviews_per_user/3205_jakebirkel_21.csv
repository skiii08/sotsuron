Blade Runner 2049," Everything a Sequel Should be.
","Blade Runner 2049 (2017) is everything a sequel should be and more at times. A poetic science fiction portrayal of what it means to be human, fueled by astounding visuals and a stellar cast. It is a suiting follow-up to Blade Runner (1982), and stands as a fantastic cinematic experience in its own right.The performances were 10/10. Everyone delivered. Ryan Gosling really found his stride in K, the main character. His silent portrayal captures so much. Harrison Ford delivers as always. Jared Leto is someone I'm normally annoyed by, but I had no problems with him in this film. The actresses for Joi and Ana were standouts as both of them carried their parts with authenticity and strength. Robin Wright was great as the powerful chief over K.The writing was fantastic. It explores what it means to be human and never lets us out of this universe. We're always entranced by the characters and by the well-told story.The direction is on point. Not only is there meaning and poetry to every scene, but we're mesmerized by the universe Denis Villenuve has expanded on. We feel exactly as we're supposed to at every moment and are never bored. I was on the edge of my seat nearly the whole time.One last aspect that deserves compliment: the cinematography. Roger Deakins is an artist behind the camera. He helps create this world and helps us feel as though we are a part of it.Blade Runner 2049 (2017) is everything a sequel should be. (10/10)",10,2,9,29 August 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Not a fan of Tarantino, but I can't argue with this!
","I'm going to be honest, I haven't been a fan of Quentin Tarantino's work. Most of the time, it's just too much. Django Unchained (2012)? This movie played it nearly perfect though.Tarantino's writing captures logic, thought, and, most of all, suspense in a way that few have. It's an excellent piece of satire with some of the most expertly written scenes I have ever seen. The opening scene might be my favorite opening scene of all time. The story was great, as was the plotting. The performances are all around great. No surprise that Christopher Waltz sticks out the most in the cast. He definitely deserved his Oscar for his work done here. He plays Colnel Hans perfectly.Tarantino's direction seems more confident here. And it reflects his own writing perfectly. Props to you, Quentin!The production design is actually quite well done, surprised nobody pointed that out. It's something that seems glossed over but, for some reason, really stuck out to me.Disclaimer: Don't watch this with your kids. Very gory and mature at several points.Overall, it's a 9/10. Very well done.",9,2,4,13 August 2018
Us," Legit scared to look in a mirror now, thanks Peele!
","This movie is so good. Lots of people are comparing it to Get Out, but I don't understand why; they're two completely different entities. It's inventive in its approach and concept, scary without utilizing typical horror ingredients, well-acted with a powerful and moving cast, funny without undercutting the horror, and smart in its writing and direction.Writing/Direction: Jordan Peele shows us, once again, why he's the new master of horror with an original premise and screenplay that gives chills and scares. His script mixes in comedy perfectly; not too much, but enough to give some temporary catharsis when needed. The concept he divised is so original and the steps the plot takes to get to an intriguing endpoint are well-done and carefully calculated. The monsters are explained enough that we the audience kinda goes 'oh, okay, that makes sense,' but not so much that we're like 'PFFT THAT'S BAT**** RIDICULOUS!' Peele stepped up his direction a bit too. I'm still trying to figure out how, but now, whenever I'm walking around my house, I'm peering around corners to make sure another one of me isn't standing there. I think that was the intention, so well done, Jordan Peele.The Performances were phenomenal: Lupita N'yongo is definitely this year's scream queen. She sells her role with a touch of empathy, realization, and in her other performance, sheer terror. Winston Duke was great, and served as a fitting and perfect comic relief; again, not too much and not too little, just enough that we're temporarily relieved. He's also a bit of a badass and one of the best portrayals of a modern day dad. And his other performance was an overbearing presence that scared in the right way. Shahadi Wright Joseph was great; a perfect mixture of teenage girl and teenage warrior (I think it's the right word.) Her other performance is suitable creepy, never faltering or changing from a terrifying face. Evan Alex might be one of the standouts. His portrayal of a little boy eerily curious of the tethered is intriguing, and he sells exactly what a little boy WOULD be thinking in this situation, which is **, ***, ****! ******** ****! ******* ***! (Ha! You thought I'd spoil it. You were wrong.) Alex's other performance as his tethered counterpart is probably one of the best ones; it's terrifying and made me shiver until I got home, and then some. The rest of the performances were fantastic, whether they were on one side or the other. I would have liked to see more interaction between Jason and his counterpart, but what we were dealt will do great as well.The rest of the movie... how do I put this? Was awesome? Yeah, that's it. The cinematography was fitting and strategically placed; very smart in its execution and letting a few horror techniques through without utilizing typical ones. The makeup and hairstyling department deserves a win, given how they executed some parts of everyone's character. The costume department also did quite well, giving a monster that was both so palatable and so horrifying at the same time with a simple costume. The score was finely tuned and lovingly terrifying, while sometimes going overboard; but I don't mind. Just about everything in this movie was great.Jordan Peele will make me scared to see my own reflection, and I like it. Making me terrified of Us (2019). This film gets a 10/10",10,6,23,22 March 2019
Knives Out," Agatha Christie Meets Clue: A Perfect Mix
","Rian Johnson's Knives Out takes cliches from murder mysteries and utilizes them to new effect. It's intricate, funny, and unexpectedly fast-paced while utilizing a hardworking all-star cast.Rian Johnson: I'm one of those people that really loved The Last Jedi, so there were certain expectations for me going into this movie. Needless to say, Rian Johnson shattered those expectations. He wrote a complex yet good-natured murder mystery, giving you the clues throughout the story before pulling the rug out from under you. I know that expression is extremely overused, but it's really what happens. He set up expectations for what this movie was supposed to be and crafts it to be something completely different. It's Agatha Christie meets Clue meets Crime and Punishment and I love every gut-busting second of it. The best part is that on a second viewing, every single thing has a different meaning; and every second meaning promotes dual characteristics.The Cast: Every single member leans into their characters with enthusiasm and fully commits to the roles. Daniel Craig is wonderful as the lead detective, constantly on the line between parody and real-life Sherlock Holmes. Chris Evans plays directly against his Captain America, clearly having the time of his life with it. Jamie Lee Curtis plays ruthless like no other, constantly protective yet always on offense. Michael Shannon plays a little bit into his type but ultimately shines through; he flexes his range, going from improv king to terrifying in an instantly smooth transition. Toni Colette plays comedy like no other; she somehow appropriately and sympathetically plays a spoiled rich person. Everyone else in the cast melds together perfectly. The standout of standouts is Ana de Armas. She blends drama and comedy deftly, taking her character on a wonderfully original journey. She sells every second of it.",10,5,13,2 December 2019
The Hateful Eight," For so long, too tedious and way too little - then somehow WAY TOO MUCH.
","This is a weird movie. It starts out tediously slow, building to a climax that makes the slow part worth it. That being said, the final minutes are way way way too much. The payoff is both worth it and far from worth it. Leading up to it, the whole thing is like a bloody stage play. The characters are definitely interesting and the performances are aces, but I can't help but feel off about the whole situation.",7,0,1,10 August 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Using History to Change the View of Today
","BlacKkKlansman (2018) is quite an interesting movie. It tells an insane, incredible true story while weaving sociopolitical commentary in seamlessly.The performances are good. Everyone plays their character with professionalism. The standouts are the lead, Ron David Washington, and the fantastic supporting performance of Adam Driver. Everyone else had perfectly fine performances.The writing may seem simple but actually has some secret genius commentary weaved into it along with a deft comedic touch. I won't spoil anything, but it shows how togetherness is better than divisiveness. The writing also draws interesting and painful parallels to the modern day.The direction is flawless. This is some of Spike Lee's most hard-hitting work. 'Nuff said.One element that stood out to me was the score. I saw this film 3 days ago and the score is still stuck in my head. Props to the composer!Updated opinion as of 3/17/19: this is one of the films of 2018 that truly did deserve best picture.BlacKkKlansman (2018) uses history to offer another view of the modern day quite effectively.

Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Satire, comedy, and an entertaining parody of the music industry!
","The minds behind the Lonely Island take a stab at the rock-mockumentary format with comedic intentions and they stab in the right place!The performances are great comedy. Andy Samberg shines in the main role. His buds from the Lonely Island do quite decently. Akiva Schaffer is especially funny. Tim Meadows and Sarah Silverman are funny, no surprise, and this film acts as a sort of intro for Chris Redd, whose performance is on point. The cameos by comedians and musicians are great.The writing crafts a pretty basic story about friendship but uniquely funny scenarios and witty, quick dialogue make it a good screenplay.The direction leaves a bit to be desired, but sometimes there isn't much to do in a mockumentary. That being said, there are quite a few bits at the end that show Kiv and Jorma's hidden talent.The soundtrack is the final star. It's exactly what it's supposed to be, stereotypical hip-hop mixed with comedy. And some color.Disclaimer: don't watch this with your kids.Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016) is satirical and comedic, while serving as an entertaining parody/commentary on the music industry. 8/10",8,3,5,14 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Reedeming qualities, fine performances
","While Bohemian Rhapsody will never match up to the excellence of Queen's music, it is entertaining, at times foot stomping, and slightly more often than not, fun.The performances by the ensemble are quite fine, but they're ultimately overshadowed by the central performance by Rami Malek. I think he really found a way to find Freddie Mercury inside of him; it's an impressive performance that elevates the film so much more.The story definitely glosses over a few things. It focuses a lot more on Freddie's heterosexual life rather than his homosexual qualities and coming out, which I don't necessarily agree with. There are times we feel disconnected from the writing, but the resolutions and climax make it worth it.The direction... I've never been a fan of Bryan Singer, I think I'm done with him at this point. The pacing feels so uneven, the shots are at times lackluster, and the lighting just feels dreary.One of the (surprisingly) best things in this film is the production design. It's the quality that helps immerse us in this time period as much as it can.Bohemian Rhapsody has some redeeming qualities that help elevate its mediocre craftsmanship, the main of which is an ensemble of fine performances, lead by the fittingly brave and charismatic Rami Malek (7/10)",7,1,1,27 November 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Holy... I can't even... YEAH!
","This had better win some Oscars.Okay, from the beginning: this movie is excellent. It is a thrill ride from start to finish, from being inventive to charting a new story to introducing so many good characters. Miles Morales' story is unique, emotional, and above all, fun.Performances: they're voice performances, so at first glance there isn't much to consider, but once you get further into the movie, you hear these actors truly commit to their characters. Shameik Moore's voice embodies Miles Morales perfectly, and Jake Johnson finally finds a character that's not a stoner; he does have fun with it. Haliee Steinfeld is exhilarating and perfect as Spider-Gwen. The rest of the cast... they're all fantastic, I just don't have time to talk about it right now. Go Spider-Ham!Direction/Writing: with three different directors, you'd expect this to come off as jumbled and incoherent, but it is not that at all. The scenes are well executed, the fight choreography is exhilarating, and the way they blend animation is simply stunning. The writing was soooooooo goooooooood. Phil Lord really had a story he wanted to tell, and he didn't skip out on any opportunity; somehow, we'll be laughing one minute and bawling the next. He really left it all on the field, especially with all ridiculous avenues he decided to go down with characters like Spider-Ham, Penny Parker, and Spider-Man Noire. The best part is it all works! The villain, Kingpin, is a bit sidelined, but it doesn't matter in the end because the story is about Miles and the people in his life. There's a moment in the trailer where Miles jumps off a building and we get this beautiful upside-down shot, and that moment is somehow even more satisfying given everything that leads up to it. The combo of story and characters truly does work.There's so many things I could talk about, from the immersive world to the killer soundtrack to the fact they use sound effects that correspond to the character's respective universes. You can feel the amount of time and effort that went into this movie, and you can feel that feeling of satisfaction that it paid off. It's a truly unique movie and inventive experience that is a sight to behold. (10/10)Seriously, Academy, look at this movie. And give it like all the awards.",10,40,76,19 December 2018
Tropic Thunder," There's a few moments, but it's plain stupid and lacks proper comedy.
","I watched Tropic Thunder (2008) ten years after it came out, so it's certainly possible I was just not viewing it in the right time period or context. That being said, Casablanca still works for me; Tropic Thunder is quite uninspired.The cast was one of the only redeeming qualities. Ben Stiller was fine in the lead role, everyone else did well. Robert Downey, Jr. was one of two standouts, playing the 'dude playing a dude disguised as another dude', but the true underrated performer in this film is Tom Cruise. Les Grossman was the most perfect thing about this film. Real quick though, I'd like to point out: gender diversity is a real problem in this film. The writing was lazy. There are so few jokes that land and the story isn't intriguing. You don't feel anything but distaste for these characters, which isn't supposed to happen.The direction was somehow lazier. It starts out being meh, but near the end it transforms into 'the opposite of Hitchcock' territory... I'm saying it's really really really bad. There's no intent or intelligence exhibited, it just feels like a mess.There are a few moments that land in Tropic Thunder (2008), but ultimately it's plain stupid and lacks proper comedy. A bad piece of satire. (4/10)",4,1,11,23 September 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A culmination of 10 years that (mostly) lives up to the hype
","Avengers: Infinity War is something that, on the first watch, you're absolutely blown away by. You walk out of the theater satisfied. It acts as a reward for sticking with the MCU and it does deliver.What I appreciate most is the fact that while this is certainly the avengers' movie, it's also the main villain Thanos' story. One thing that this may seem is overstuffed. It's a lot to take in, certainly, and with so many characters to fit in, of course it's going to seem that way. There certainly could have been some improvements to the story, but overall the plot was well done.The direction is what stands out. The Russo brothers have crafted an addition that truly serves as a fantastic piece of blockbuster action while remaining faithful to the previous MCU directors.One last thing I don't normally compliment: the CGI and visual affects were on point. Marvel has never had a real problem with it in the past, but this was just plain amazing. One of the most visually dazzling films of this last year.Avengers: Infinity War is a culmination of 10 years of good films that mostly lives up to the hype. (8/10)",8,2,5,11 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Still Witty, Still Unrestrained, Still Tarantino - Just Not As Much
","I'm not going to preface this by saying I'm a diehard Tarantino fan. I'm not, though I do for the most part respect his films. Inglorious Basterds is one of my favorite movies. That being said, this was all Tarantino, just... underwhelming. I walked away feeling partially unsatisfied when it comes to Quentin Tarantino. Objectively, this was a good movie with some twists that I appreciate and I'll look at it that way. I can't help but think that while the character arcs were filled, the Tarantino action and suspense quota was left incomplete.",8,14,30,30 July 2019
Django Unchained," A bit much, but still good!
","I'm not the biggest fan of Quentin Tarantino. However, this isn't bad. Performances were good, as expected. Jamie Foxx was great as the title character, brining a silent gusto of sorts that worked. Kerry Washington was good. Leonardo DiCaprio was a bit crazy, but I believe that was the intent. If it was, well done Leo! Sam Jackson was interesting and played his part well. As always, Christoph Waltz amazes. Not as much as in Inglorious Basterds (2009), but still a stellar performance.The writing was... interesting. I don't know if it deserved the awards it got. The characters that were crafted were quite good. The main writing that made it was the relations and dialogue between the characters. I just don't know.The direction was not bad at all. It felt a bit more like Inglorious Basterds (2009) than Pulp Fiction (1994), in a cartoonish kind of way, but was still solid. The pacing made it seem slower than it should have been and therefore made me feel as though I was in a movie for about an hour longer than I should have.One last thing that deserves praise: the environment that was created seems very much like the 1800s. From the production design to the props to the costumes, this felt like it was taking place during one of America's most difficult times.A bit much, but still good! 7/10",9,0,1,14 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Call me crazy or whatever...
","A disclaimer on the Last Jedi, art, and toxicity: you're allowed to not like this movie just as you're allowed to like this movie. You are no less intelligent based on your opinion; you are no less of a fan based on your opinion. I love this movie and I have very good friends who definitely did not. That is okay. I'm sorry if you felt the Last Jedi ruined your childhood or ruined Star Wars for you; but please don't attack the people who put every ounce of love they had into this piece of art. Don't personally attack Rian Johnson and don't attack the actors for doing their job; and certainly don't ever attack anyone because of race, sex, or just who they are as a person. You're allowed to not like this movie; just don't hate the cast and crew behind it. That way lies madness.Now for the review:I found this movie to be great. To people who found the Force Awakens to be too similar to A New Hope, this movie presented an alternative path. Rian Johnson delivered what any Star Wars fan would crave: an epic space opera that expands beyond its predecessors while delivering extremely satisfying visuals accompanied by a mostly satisfying story.Writing/Direction: Rian Johnson is a Star Wars fan and it shows big time. He has a lot of love for these characters and to explain every narrative beat would be tedious and unentertaining. He took several risks with already established characters and most of them paid off. I personally like what he did with the ideology behind the legend of Luke Skywalker. In addition, his final act was classic Jedi and perfect for his conclusion. And while I wish I could have seen more of the late Carrie Fisher, I felt her lessons did not go quietly into the night. Johnson writes three plot lines that weave together coherently and cross in extremely effective ways. Poe's leadership arc was solid and I'm sure will pay off going into the final chapter. Finn's rebel arc might be my only big problem with this movie; it was not quite as resonant but it's understandable what progress he had to make to become the best kind of rebel scum. Rey's arc is wholly satisfying and creates a new path for the Skywalker saga to continue. The interesting thing is how Rian gave such an arc to Kylo Ren; villains are mostly these mysterious, intimidating badasses without much context. Darth Sidious was just some powerful Sith and Darth Vader was originally just a good guy turned bad. In this film, we see that adding multiple dimensions to Kylo Ren is satisfying in every way possible; speeding up his parallel course then shifting it shows his true character. Overall, the script takes some risks and talks about how heroes are perceived as well as how the past is seen. I'll let people draw their own conclusions, but I feel like this movie gave room for Star Wars to grow beyond what it is. Aside from the writing, the direction is excellent. Rian coaxes finely tuned career-best performances from nearly every cast member and has a visually swell time doing it.Performances: so so so so many things to say. Where to start... Kelly Marie Tran is a fine performer and while I don't entirely agree with her character, Rose, on paper, her individual performance is convincing and just ecstatic. (Please don't attack her for who she is physically.) Domnhall Gleeson is on point as always. He takes the humorous side to his character in stride while remaining totally believable and providing some of the best humor in the film. Andy Serkis is probably one of the most notable actors of our time due to the fact that he can do so much acting with a bright light constantly shining in his face (give him an Oscar already!). Benicio Del Toro is clearly just hopping along for a nice little ride and proving his consistent acting prowess while he's at it. His stutter was an interesting choice and it doesn't exactly distract, I just felt like it didn't entirely fit in. Anthony Daniels - sir, how do you do so much acting inside that tin man suit? Well done. Laura Dern was fine enough and executed a somehow organized rebel while she was at it. Carrie Fisher will be dearly missed. She has so much love for Leia and all things around her. She chews the scenery with every word and every action. Mark Hamill gives possibly the best performance of his career; a man tired of the legend and teachings of the Jedi who gradually realizes what the force must be for balance to be properly obtained. He may have disagreed with some character choices but that didn't stop him from bringing his A-game. Adam Driver kills it in a similar way; his Skywalker is so well executed and driven. He brings a new villain to the galaxy and shows actual character growth in the best way possible. John Boyega is admirable as Finn; a rebel who gradually gains a cause and learns about the difference between fighting what you hate and saving what you love. Oscar Isaac is one of the most underrated actors of our time. He gets more to work with this time around and does not disappoint as he goes from desperate rebel to confident and understanding leader. Daisy Ridley... just wow. This heroine is my heroin. She takes her character to the best and somehow most balanced of extremes; she becomes a Jedi through the sheer power of acting. She is so good. I can't say it enough. They all were.Anything else I had to say was said first. The production itself however was amazing. On-point visual effects, wonderful lighting and cinematography, immersive production design, well-world-worn costumes, and an iconic score help this movie to feel even more like the Star Wars we know and love.This movie exists and it's canon. It happened in the Star Wars universe. It's not up to us, the audience, how this universe is supposed to run. We're passengers along for this incredible ride of cinema that George Lucas opened our eyes to 40 years ago. Isn't it a fun ride?",10,9,23,13 December 2019
The Shape of Water," A Good Film.
","Guillermo Del Toro's The Shape of Water (2017) is a masterfully crafted piece of modern cinema. It's a good film.The performances were great. Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins both delivered Oscar-worthy acting. Michael Shannon was understated, I think. Everyone else was good. Oh, side note: I thank god for Octavia Spencer.The writing was... uneven. It exhibited some themes that were fascinating but not extremely well executed. Sometimes the writing was overly subtle and sometimes it was blatantly obvious. It was a good story which mostly made up for it.The direction was incredible. With lighting, camera angles, performances, just about every piece of mise-en-scene, we're immersed in this world like a period piece. The way the scenes were executed was always perfect.The rest of the filmmaking aspects were fine. I especially liked the production design (a pivotal part of the world that was created), the cinematography (every frame felt like a painting, quite striking), and the score (undoubtedly the 3rd best score of the year).The Shape of Water (2017) isn't perfect. However, it is a good film with decent direction and great performances.",8,2,7,12 September 2018
Whiplash," The. Perfect. Film.
","This is one of the greatest films of all time. Always on beat, never off tempo, and selling the art it portrays to such a unique level.The performances are great. Miles Teller stands out a bit but ultimately is overshadowed by the incredible J.K. Simmons. This goes down as one of the greatest supporting acts in history. You'd be scared of Terrance Fletcher from the moment you saw him, and there's never a beat when you're not.The story is unpredictable, with a masterfully crafted ending. Damien Chazelle might be a genius. The writing embraces Jazz and becomes a part of it.The direction is one of the best directions I have ever seen. From the very first sequence, we're pulled in and never pushed out. We're in for a ride that'll make us gasp, cry, and cheer.The music is an essential component of this film and it shines quite well. As a jazz trumpeter in high school, this music brings me back and lets me feel alive again. Thank you Justin Hurwitz.Whiplash is a unique experience everyone should see. 10/10.",10,0,0,13 August 2018
Black Panther," Full characters, a vibrant world, and an engrossing tale.
","Black Panther is one of those movies that, years from now, everyone will look back at and ask 'how did this not win all the awards?' It's intricate, filled with such a world, and remains entertaining all the same.Writing/Direction: Ryan Coogler, man. Yes. The dude really knows how to make a movie. From his directional touch that really pulls us into the world of Wakanda to the writing that creates such vivid characters that really go to their full potential, Ryan Coogler has created a masterpiece not only as a superhero movie, but as a general film.Performances: Chadwick Boseman IS T'challa and is practically perfect in his casting. He's great, no denying it. The thing that intrigued me, however, is how he seemed a bit outplayed by his supporting ensemble. No offense to Chadwick, but there's a lot more at play than the lead in this film and I really appreciate that. The women of Wakanda are especially badass. Lupita, Danai, and Letita shine as Nakia, Okoye, and Shuri respectively. They're fantastic female characters who have fantastic performers behind them. I could say some stuff about Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis, who both give off appealing enough performances, Angela Basset, who practically plays herself (very well I might add), the formidable and capable Winston Duke, and Daniel Kalluya, who continues to hold his own. However, I firmly believe none of them hold a candle to Michael B. Jordan's performance as the central villain, Erik Killmonger. He gains our sympathy throughout the film while still being a fairly intimidating villain with complex motives and reasoning that makes the viewer (and T'challa) think. He gives a performance that puts him at the top of the Marvel villain list (not quite at the top of all CBM villains, I mean, Heath Ledger amiright?).I still insist on praising just about every aspect of this film. Tell me you haven't listened to Ludwig Goranssen's killer soundtrack and it hasn't gotten stuck in your head. Tell me you weren't mesmerized by the production design that made Wakanda so palatable. Tell me you weren't impressed by the beautiful costumes, well-choreographed fights, and awesome cinematography that was shown throughout. (The only thing that holds merit is some CGI issues, but even then, consider their challenge and look at the beautiful establishing shots of Wakanda and tell me that's not some beautifully rendered CGI.)Black Panther is a fully realized world with vibrant characters and an engrossing tale and serves as a new standard for filmmaking.

Creed II," As good as Creed? No. But definitely surpasses most of the Rocky movies.
","Creed II is undeniably formulaic, sticking to the formula established by Rocky movies of the past and sequels in general. While it's not as good as Creed, it's better than almost every Rocky with the exception of the original.Steven Caple Jr. delivers something poetic and while there is no particularly memorable fight scene, he does use a particular visual style to emphasize drama, suspense, and other varying emotions. Sylvester Stallone returns to his role as writer and this time, it pays off big time. While he does stick to some clear formulaic character arcs with the protagonists, the thing that makes his writing good is the way he handles the Dragos. Ivan and Viktor gain my sympathy and Stallone turns them into so much more than the cardboard cut villains we saw in Rocky IV. He writes Ivan Drago with this intense perfection that honestly left me wanting more. Well done on both writing and direction.Stallone is great playing what he plays best: Rocky. Tessa Thompson shines as Bianca and the actor who played Viktor Drago did pretty good. Dolph Lundgren got a chance to show why he's an extremely underrated actor in his return to his infamous role as Ivan Drago. He really does kill it in every scene. And yet Michael B. Jordan still kills it more than all of them as Adonis Creed. Creed's raw intensity and hunger to continue upholding his family's legacy while creating his own is perfectly captured through MBJ's performance.Creed II isn't as good as Creed, but it definitely surpasses many of the Rocky films thanks to confident direction, decent writing, and plethora of finely tuned performances.

Green Book," Is it revolutionary? No. Is it bad? Certainly not. Is it funny? Oh, yes.
","Preface to this review before I get to the art itself: This movie is problematic in more ways than one. Not only does it act as though it solves racism by the end (by simply suggesting that people not be racist), it also uses the concept of the white savior (an ideal that everyone should research), which is definitely a move that should be disposed of. If you're willing to ignore that idealism (although you shouldn't), there's more than a few redeeming qualities to this movie.Writing/Direction: Who would've thought that the guy who brought the world Dumb and Dumber could deliver such a deft touch? Peter Farrely (Farelly?) gives us a mushy feeling throughout the whole picture and lets us know he's got it under control. Given the fact that the two leads are in a car the whole time, I'm impressed. The writing, while claimed inaccurate by Don Shirley's family, is definitely impressive in that it uses humor in a well-timed way. I will admit that at the end, I did have a warm feeling inside.Performances: Mahershala Ali has proven himself to be one of the greatest actors of our time with so few performances; his performance as Don Shirley truly is the heart of the movie and succeeds as such. Viggo Mortensen is the lead actor and can hold his own as well, from eating an entire pizza uncut to going through an impressive body transformation to showing off his ability to once again master an accent. Viggo and Mahershala's chemistry just makes everything better, so thank you for that. Everyone else in the cast was just fine, they clearly knew the callibur of actors they were working alongside and let them do their thing.Other than that, it's a relatively basic movie. Yeah, there's some fancy music and some period-accurate production design, but it's just nothing special. That combined with the issues it has socially makes this an alright piece of filmmaking.Opinion: This did not deserve best picture.Green book is not revolutionary, nor is it entirely bad, but it certainly is funny through and through.

Annihilation," Science Fiction at it's most unquantifiable - that's good!
","Writer-Director Alex Garland follows up Ex Machina with a smart, visually stunning, incredibly originally thought science fiction feature that engages the audience and provides an intricate exploration of themes, all brought to life by a wonderful ensemble.Direction/Writing: The world created in Annihilation is simply stunning. Alex Garland takes his fictional 'shimmer' to a whole new level and showcases some purely science fiction ideas. He also writes intriguing character arcs that evolve around the idea of Annihilation itself. He uses some biological concepts as metaphors for the characters that truly works. The story isn't completely original, sure, but the way it is executed and the steps it takes are so breathtakingly unique and interesting.Performances: Natalie Portman shines as the Star, as she always does. Oscar Isaac showed why he's one of the most underrated actors in show biz with just a few minutes of screen time. The rest of the team was incredible; Jennifer Jason Leigh in particular left an impression. The standout of the shimmer team was Tessa Thompson, who conveys a broken, traumatized, lighthearted woman with such empathy and passion that it's hard to tear yourself away.Other thoughts: the score was subtle, yet awesome. The visual effects were frankly stunning and off the charts. The production design was breathtakingly beautiful and, at times, fittingly eerie... and the artwork displayed was intricate and magnificent.Annihilation is a fittingly unquantifiable piece of Science Fiction.

Inside Llewyn Davis," Oscar Isaac Delivers, The Music Soars in our Hearts, and The Coens bring in their Finest Work
","If it was never old and it was never new, then it's a folk song. Words spoken by Llewyn Davis in this film that could not apply to it more. This film is a folk song in its structure, tone, and scope; a song that makes us laugh, think, and at times break.Writing/Direction: Ethan and Joel Coen are two of the modern masters of cinema with works that range from the Big Lebowski to No Country for Old Men. While those are certainly good, I am firm in my stance that none of them hold a candle to the intimate character study that is Inside Llewyn Davis. Their direction paints a portrait of intimacy while sticking to a dulled color palleate that fits perfectly. Their writing is fantastic. Fun fact: they actually do not plot out their movies, they just write without having much of an idea where the story is going. It is true creative writing that allows us to spend a week Inside Llewyn Davis.Performances: While John Goodman is typically hilarious, Carey Mulligan is accurately and rightfully dramatic, and Justin Timberlake is pitch perfect, none of the supporting characters can compare to the finely tuned performance of Oscar Isaac, who gives what may be his best work yet. There were times I forgot I was watching Poe Dameron/Nathan from Ex Machina and only saw Llewyn Davis on the screen. He portrays a sarcastic, witty, somber Folk Singer with ease and his vocal parts are off the charts. Oscar Isaac is one of the truly underrated actors of the modern day.The music is fantastic; a medley of folk songs combined with what would be considered modern back in the 60s (Please Mr. Kennedy). The cinematography is intimate and well-framed. Every aspect of this film corresponds to the Coens' finely tuned work. (10/10)",10,0,0,13 March 2019
