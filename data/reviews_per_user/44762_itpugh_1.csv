First Man," All very worthy, but...
","...I enjoyed 'Bad Times at the El Royale' more. Its not that it's bad, the good stuff is really good. But the gaps between the good stuff are really long and a bit dull. And what is it with the wobbly camerawork the whole time? Ok, I get it for the launches and suchlike - authenticiy, realism etc. When it's an intimate conversation, filmed in extreme closeup, not for me. Just aggravating. Arthouse for arthouse's sake, the whole thing smacks of pretention.",7,0,0,20 October 2018
