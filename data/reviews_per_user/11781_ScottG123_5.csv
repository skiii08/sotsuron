The Ring," Bad film, but scary as hell
","This film truly scared me.  I had nigthmares about it for a week.  But after I thought about it, I realized the film was totally incoherent and it made no sense and the acting was bad (except for the little girl).  Go eat a hot dog and have a better time.",5,0,0,21 June 2003
X-Men," Ok, not very good
","This movie was too much hype for a mediocre movie.  The Holocaust scene atthe beginning is just down rigth depressing, and it satys with you the entire movie.  Good end sequences.  Everything before that sucked really badly.  I recommend Spider Man if you want to see a good comic book movie, and that got nominated for an Oscar.  Shame on you Ian Mckellen, you're better than this.  I highly recommend the sequel X2: X Men United.  A major improvement over this rubbish.",4,1,2,21 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the best films ever made
",This is genuinely one of the best films ever produced.  It delivers excellent performances (Mckellen is genius) and it leaves the viewer with a good feeling.  A mUst see and a MUST BUY.  10 stars out of ten.  The 3 hours goes very quickly.  BRILLIANT FILM MAKING LADIES AND GENTLEMAN.,10,1,2,19 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Brilliant Film, Equal to FOTR
",What an amazing movie.  THis should have won Best Picture over Chicago honestly.  It is just breathtaking and dramatic and it just does everything right.  Chicago is a bunch of mushy crap and the only thing good about it was Queen Latifah and Zeta Jones.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM!,10,0,0,21 June 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Not better than LOTR- Connely was great
","This film didn't blow me out of the water like LOTR, but it was good.  I don't think that it should have won over LOTR though- which was obviously a better movie all around.  The highligth of this film was Jennifer Connely- she was amazing and totally deserved the Oscar.  Russel Crowe was also brilliant.  This was the year of the snubbs at the Oscars.  Denzel sucked in Training Day and LOTR was better than this- this should have won BEST DIRECTOR< ACTOR< AND SUPPRTING ACTRESS and thats it.",6,0,1,19 June 2003
