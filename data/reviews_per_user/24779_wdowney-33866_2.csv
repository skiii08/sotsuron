",I didn't see what the others are writing. I go and watch every thriller movie i can and this one just didn't cut it. If you like the thrill of being scared and sitting on the edge of your seat...don;t go to this film. Very slow and strange with a very odd ending.,1,6,13,23 June 2018

",The four people that went with me all agreed that the movie was very confusing and not scary at all. We all thought it was a huge waste of money. I have no idea how it got such good ratings.,2,7,13,27 March 2019
