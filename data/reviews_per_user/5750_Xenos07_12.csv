Ford v Ferrari," James Mangold, a defination of PERFECTION ! ! !
","Who said racing movies is boring because casts always wins ? i don't think that rubbish is valid anymore. I mean the man who directed Logan, what you expect from him ? Seriously, the casts did an awesome job. The vibes of '66, with soundtracks, costumes, artifact, editing everything was so perfect. The ongoing politics inside the Ford was truly cumbersome but beyond everything, it's a masterpiece movie to me.",9,1,1,11 May 2020
This Is the End," People who can't take sarcasm with fantasy really need to avoid it and if you're fun guy, take a SHOT!
","I've always been a fan of Seth Rogen & Franco fan. They're both deadly sarcastic duo tbh! Watched their The Pineapple Express, also was fun to watch. What made it more funny with adding Jay in the cast, this dude is seriously underrated. Danny, Craig, Jonah took it into another level. Celebrities took their real name here which may feel like incidents are truly happening. Loved it.",8,2,3,24 May 2020
Dead Poets Society," Carpe diem! A sad melancholy.
","One of the few films I would like to watch over and over again and it was a tumultuous experience to me. This movie perfectly portrayed modern vision of our society. Always follow your instinct, show you who you are, prove it with passion, courage. Life is a race if you halt, people will leap forward you. But what's the point of leading a race when you can't suck the marrow out of your life. Robin Williams always wished to be a teacher like this in his school life and he didn't let down. This journey felt like the true visual representation of Dead Poets Society!",10,1,1,26 May 2020
Ready Player One," Virtuality blended with Reality, good but...... not perfect....!
","Sorry, no hate to Mr. Spielberg but the story is kinda missing something, maybe not
ardent enough. Honestly I'm a big fan of him since he's a masterpiece creator of films but picking youth films at this age not gonna lie doesn't suit him. Adding so many references from past films made it quite interesting. There's tons of good motion picture directors that could make action scenes bit intense, frightening but....I'll take it. Kudos to OASIS.........",7,2,2,29 May 2020
Dallas Buyers Club," Matthew, Jared. a deadly performance ! ! !
","Astonishing performance from Matthew & Jared, nailed it. He fought alone for all. The physical transformation of Matthew from beginning till end, hats off. I was bit of skeptic when I saw Jared here as I couldn't recognize him. Superb acting overall.",7,0,0,13 May 2020
Before Sunset," Let me sing you a waltz!
","A trip to Paris, hanging out after 9 years since Vienna, everything is perfect. I was upset they both found themselves in those years, doing different things that makes them sad and happy simultaneously. A different kind of sunset I would like to cherish!",8,0,0,16 May 2020
Ex Machina," The FUTURE is HERE!
","Brilliant writing by Alex. The visual effects, background scores, artifacts all were mesmerizing. Alicia really nailed it. This movie resembles distinct dystopian future where intelligence will rule over human kind and yes they can be cruel as hell. Human build intelligence to test for human ergonomics but AI will control over human function to escape the true reality.",8,0,1,14 May 2020
Midsommar," wow, a cult show ladies and gentlemen!
","What a terrible crap! don't get me wrong, I like horror movies but this ? what's this ? who was high during writing it ? absolutely makes no sense to me at all, horrible pagan story but yeah found a bit swedish folklore taste. but nah...... terribly slow story, slow progression!!!! Wouldn't like to recommend this move to anybody !!! save time, don't watch it!",1,8,12,29 April 2020
Snowden," REVEALING DARK SIDE OF THE INTERNET, A TRUE AMERICAN HERO !
","First of all I would like to appreciate Joseph as he portrayed excellently like the real Edward Snowden. Fantastic job done by him.We all live in this era of technology. Using social medias, chatting, booking flight tickets, using browsers, VPN etc. But the most terrifying matter is that what if someone tracking my internet world? Isn't that scary? What if I'm writing this review on the internet and someone already tapped it? There's no confidentiality, no privacy nothing! It's a universal true that we never agree to the terms and conditions that given by any operator or so. This is the dark part of the internet. Millions of people might be bugged by medias, operators, governments, group of industries. We're giving them data, sharing our digital footprints and digital advertisements shows up anywhere you're browsing. This is truly terrifying and scary.This is the dark side of our internet that we pay for. It's brave that Ed truly showed the world the hidden face. Brilliantly directed by Oliver Stone,",9,1,1,17 May 2020
Marriage Story," compassionism with emotion, enjoyed it thorughly !!!!
","Hats off to Adam driver, i mean seriously. Amazing performance from him, especially that fighting scene with Scarlett, it was so real. didn't understand how Laura Dern won an academic award with a short acting scene. is that how academic awards work for acting as a supporting actress ? I don't know, maybe! overall a great example of solicitude!",9,1,1,10 May 2020
Before Sunrise," A kind of sunrise I would like to fantacize !
","A true story of Linklater, it was truly enjoying. The most charming thing was seeing the chemistry of Ethan and Julie. Everything felt so real and yes this is kind of story I always anticipate.LOVE STILL EXISTS, DOESN'T IT!",8,0,0,15 May 2020
Annihilation," A super-tensed bizarre thriller!
","Another brilliant Alex Garland direction. VFX, artifact, atmosphere all were exceptional. One might feel ambiguity with such ending, but it's all in there. But I think poor choice of casts except Natalie, as usual she did her best. Background music made it more suspense and thrilling. Haters will hate, but unquestionably exceptional movie it is!",8,1,2,23 May 2020
