Skyfall," Best Bond movie of the last 20 years
","I can not really be very original with my review, and most likely this will get lost under a 'mountain-slide' of critics, however I just had to write how much I enjoyed this film. I have watched (like all movie goers) all the Bond films, and I think Daniel is one of the great ones. Connery has always been a favorite of mine, he gave Bond style and portrayed him as invincible. Almost like a super hero who fights for good. Shiny, Clean but Unreal. Craig has adapted the character to the modern age and has given him weaknesses and depth. I really like this approach. I always thought that Bond should have a human side too.Regarding the 'reset' of the franchise, I think that this is a brilliant idea. Whomever thought of that, is truly the future and last hope of Hollywood. What the movies need are not special effects, but people with original ideas. The Bond 'reset' has truly reset my love for the Series.Congrats for making one of the Best movies of 2012 !",10,6,15,28 December 2012
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," X wing vs Tie Fighter action at last
","I am a huge SW fan so this was a great and fan movie for me to watch. As I watched it with my wife though, I had to explain A LOT of things, and it became apparent that it was a bit confusing to a non-SW fan. The plot is basic, flat, and practically an excuse for the magnificent battles after the first hour! The performances are very disappointing if you think of the wonderful actors in this film. I do not feel that the stars were really into Star Wars to be honest, so they failed to deliver their lines convincingly. Regardless!!! It's all about the battles! Excellently choreographed, fully satisfying, and exactly the thing I have been asking for since ROTJ.So, do not expect anything story wise, but the battles alone are worth watching this movie time and time and time again. 8/10 for the X Wing VS Tie Fighter Action !",8,1,2,31 March 2017
Silver Linings Playbook," A movie worth watching at last...
","A good script, great acting, great dialogs(!). All the components that make a great movie are here. I had heard from movie critics that this was not a very original scenario and I did not expect the movie to be as good as it turned out to be. I am very glad that finally Hollywood produced a movie with characters who have depth. Bradley Cooper was an excellent choice for this film, and he is really worth the Oscar nomination as his performance is graded 10 out of 10. All the cast, down to the last man (or woman), have been chosen perfectly for their part. Finally someone is beginning to do good work again in Hollywood-land...I hope we see more movies like this in the future.",9,1,3,30 January 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not sure if it's a movie or a video game I am watching ...lol
","After the previous three 'Amazing' Spider Man movies, this one is one Spider Man movie that should never have existed. The studio is obviously trying to make extra cash, and with no regard to plot or acting, made a shallow movie with the thinnest plot possible, that looks more like a video game or a comic from the 60's. Everyone was expecting spider-man to face the Lizard these past few years, and now that is finally happened it's a disaster. Peter Parker has been transformed to a cool kid super-genius set on a path to save the world. Unfortunately the only intention of the studio people was to create some nice cool looking cgi fight scenes, and hope people would pay to see them on the big screen. To their disappointment though, I am sure that many 21st century moviegoers have grown a brain and expect a plot even at a super hero movie like spider man. The casting is good, but what can even a good actor do if he is given silly lines to act with? This movie is a waste of time and money, feeding on the good name of the truly great spider-man movies.

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Brilliant !
","The first time that special effects have ever been combined with excellent storytelling taking place in real life situations! This movie is a very big surprise as all the movies that have come from Hollywood this past decade either focus on acting or impressive effects. I would not go into details about the plot as it should remain a surprise, but I could just emphasize the fact that this is a sweet encouraging story that you should not miss !!! It is a road movie that combines elements of the current collapsing economy with hope and adventure. It is a shout encouraging people to start living out in the real world instead of the digital world. It is far more than you expect...",10,1,7,10 January 2014
Evil Dead," Bruce Campbell Required to Save movie...
","This movie in my opinion was defined by the awesome Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi. So what is the point of making it without Ash as the main character, and with no inspired direction the way Reimi did it? Well...no point at ALL! We have seen dozens of gory horror movies, and this does not bring much to the table the way it was done. Just the 'Evil Dead' sticking their heads up from the chained basement are hardly a reason to watch an entire movie...where is the humor, the awesome punch lines and the legendary boom-stick? Why on earth is everything so serious ?! Evil Dead is supposed to be scary fun, and this film is boring as hell...this remake is an epic FAIL. Great work Hollywood...",4,11,18,1 July 2013
Clash of the Titans," Crap Movie Alert
","The costume design of the movie is very good. The ancient Greek armors and props actually look Greek and the Greek Warrior characters look 'damaged', tired, and original (till they open their mouth and speak ANY line of dialog). The Set design is a good -visually delightful- mix of several civilizations, and even though the locations of the movie do not really look like Greece we let it slide. These are the good elements of the movie.Other than that... Perseus is a Terminator-like / ex fisherman / Avenger on the war path, who slaughters anything that comes near him, while his comrades 'jump into fire' for him with no obvious reason. The Perseus character is as shallow as possible, and the script and dialogs hardly give any chance to the actors in general to actually act. There are nice actors in this movie who unfortunately are helpless in the hands of the merciless scriptwriters who doomed them with silly lines a 5 yo could write.This is a movie based entirely in action scenes and special effects. Unfortunately, the action scenes and special effects are no better than the dialogs. The Medusa character is hardly movie quality 3d (Many games actually have more realistic graphics these days). The Kraken moved from the coasts of Norway and Iceland to the Ancient Greece, but it still did not do much good as most of the time we were watching Perseus chasing a blurry Harpy instead of fighting that poor monster. The lightsaber idea was quite good, as when Perseus was turning on his lightsaber I was thinking of Star Wars and the movie was more bearable. I actually thought he was going to use the Force at some scenes of the movie (but never did to my disappointment). In general, there are countless scenes that I could comment on but there is point in that. The movie is as bad as they can get, regarding script, dialogs, action and special effects. Other than the Art Direction, there is no reason to pay for this 10 euro in a movie theater. This is a fun movie, but a huge disappointment too p.s. The 'Slutty' Io character was a good twist, and we can understand why Perseus dumps 'the love of his life' (according to the myth) Andromeda, to hook up with herÂ…NOT",3,2,3,12 April 2010

2001: A Space Odyssey," I have been trying to watch this for 33 years
","The first time I went to watch this film I was only 10, so it is normal that I wanted to leave after the first 20 minutes. I was not mature enough to comprehend and appreciate the visual fanfare created my Master Kubrick.Three decades later, after watching every film made from 1930 to 2018, and being a huge Kubrick fan, I decided that it was time to give this film another try. Visually it is an excellent movie, especially considering that it was made in the 60's!
However, I strongly believe it should be 1 hour shorter. Some scenes make it very hard to watch this film. For example: The 10 minute LSD Moon-Trip(ping) is especially hard to follow. Perhaps the artist decided to move in that direction because it was the 60's, and Surrealism was Hip. I don't know. 
Sadly I did not fall for the surreal space Odyssey of the otherwise Amazing Kubrick. Worth giving it a try though...",5,1,6,22 March 2018
American Made," Please no more Escobar movies !
","Sadly this is one of the worst Tom Cruise movies ever made. To me it felt more like a documentary than an actual movie. Just another attempt to cash in on the very 'trendy' Escobar persona. The acting was OK because the actors are good, but they lucked the material that would allow them to 'shine'. Overall there was a huge shortage of emotion and suspense. I found some common 'cool' elements with 'The Wolf of Wall Street' regarding direction and pace, but even these failed to save the movie miserably. Why? Because this movie was not directed by Martin. So: This movie is like watching a documentary on the 'Life of Barry Seal'. Watch it on DVD.",5,0,3,8 December 2017
12 Strong," Unwatchable
","A typical -bad- propaganda film like the ones they used to make during all the great wars. Outrageous heroic lines, silly heroic action and psychological terror for cinema goers who feel threatened by the 'Taliban'. Movie 'politics' can be such a joke, especially when a few years back in Rambo 3 the US was allied with the Taliban against the Soviets (remember Rambo 3?). Anyways, if you wish to make a good propaganda movie learn from the WW2 propaganda movies cause they were way better (evil NAZIS helped in that to be fair). 12 Strong is a waste of a good movie budget.",1,9,22,8 May 2018
