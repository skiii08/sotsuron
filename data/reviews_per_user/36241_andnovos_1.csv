Hereditary," No masterpiece, just boring and emotionally neutral
","Reading about the movie and seeing all the reviews really made me feel excited to see it. But as minutes of the film passed and scenes continued to exchange, I kept on waiting the moment when I as a viewer will experince some sort of excitement but it failed to happen. This movie is boring, predictible, emotionally neutral, in no way scary, with very few elements of horror. Pure disappointment. As I was seeing it in the movies, I couldn't wait for it to end.",1,6,13,18 August 2018
