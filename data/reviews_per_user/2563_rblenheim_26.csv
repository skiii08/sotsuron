The Lobster," A terrifying dystopia created by the brilliant Yorgos Lanthimos
","One of 2016's most unique and bizarre films is the pitch-black comedy, 'The Lobster'. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, an idiosyncratic Greek 'angry young man' filmmaker who had previously garnered both praise and excoriation with his 2009 Oscar-nominated 'Dogtooth', this provocative and uncompromising surrealist masterpiece is set in a dystopian near-future in which only couples are allowed to survive. If any unfortunate citizen should become single through divorce or death, they are given 45 days to find a new mate to marry or are punished by being transformed into an animal and released into the woods. The one silver lining in this dark cloud is that each unsuccessful single gets to choose which animal. A lobster is the bizarre choice of our protagonist, an emotionally scarred architect named David, brilliantly played by Colin Farrell with a perennial deer-in-the-headlights expression. Rachel Weisz is the woman with whom he forms a bond in the film's second half when he fatefully falls into a group of rebels who have made it illegal to couple.Almost universally lauded by critics for being a razor-sharp satire of societal templates examining sexual mores and the desperately sad world of single dating, 'The Lobster' is also a moving if unconventional love story rooted in the theater of the absurd, a Kafkaesque fable that perfectly combines Swiftian wit with Mozartian elegance as, in the words of one critic, 'it opens (one's) eyes to a new way of storytelling.' It is rare cinematic caviar for both the eyes and the mind of the most discriminating. As to the film's fastidiously luxurious visual style, Lanthimos seems the successor to Stanley Kubrick -- but as if the director of 'A Clockwork Orange' had mated with a scorpion.Although it won the Jury Prize at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, many will not like this film. Samuel Beckett would have. I've seen it half a dozen times, each time loving it more. For the discerning few, this will be one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of recent years. For the rest, they can keep waiting for Godot.",10,0,3,22 February 2017
Blade Runner 2049," A worthy masterful sequel to the original masterpiece!
","It was the long-awaited sequel to Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction classic, 'Blade Runner' that grabbed me unlike any other film in 2017. As I accumulated four theatrical sojourns watching 'Blade Runner 2049' I found a deeper and richer experience with each viewing, one that, to me, even surpassed the original as serious art. The reason for this was undoubtedly due to Scott entrusting the renowned Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve (who had made 'Incendies', 'Prisoners', 'Sicario' and the previous year's 'Arrival') when making his version to honor the original film's world and philosophical themes while laying claim to his own poetic vision and personal style. Taking place 30 years after Deckard and Rachael had emerged from the elevator to leave the smog and overpopulation of 2019 Los Angeles, this new film follows a recent model replicant (with a normal human lifespan) called 'K' (played perfectly by an appropriately imperturbable Ryan Gosling) as he investigates a growing uprising when he unearths the remains of a once-pregnant replicant, something that leads him not only into mysterious territory in which he discovers the now reclusive Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford in one of his most nuanced performances), but also leads him through a journey into his own identity. Darker and more sparse than the original, 'Blade Runner 2049' dives into a more nihilistic milieu where the earth's digital and technological systems have been wiped out from an ecological disaster known as the Blackout, and the air and water have become toxic, plants and animals have gone extinct, and there has been mass migration to urban centers with the rich moving to off-world colonies. Even sunlight is only visible through thick layers of smog and clouds, and various cities like San Diego have become large garbage disposal areas. Villeneuve, now at the peak of his directorial powers, moves us inexorably throughout this elaborately-detailed world for a full 164 minutes, something for which the film's cynical detractors have criticized, but I praise him for having the courage to allow its story to develop in a carefully measured fashion, taking the time to allow its willing and patient viewers to be engulfed into its world view. I liken it to turning over one's self to the listening of a Wagner opera like 'Parsifal' in which time seems to stop as one is encompassed completely by another place, another time -- and after its long viewing I seemed to awaken as if having submitted to a dream, emerging somewhat reborn and more enlightened with knowledge of the human experience. And that is what this and the original film are really about. Underneath its marvelously detailed science fiction trappings with its state-of-the-art production design and special effects (often eschewing CGI for authentically-constructed sets and realistic miniatures), and heightened to a level of unmatched beauty by the cinematography of Roger Deakins, the film is really a thoughtful meditation on what makes us human.",10,5,12,17 March 2018
Darkest Hour," Great subject; hackneyed treatment
","Joe Wright's 'Darkest Hour' poses a problem for me. The subject is interesting and important, but the film, following Winston Churchill's early days as Prime Minister of Britain during World War II, never rises above the average. Worse: one could also say that -- in the fictitious sequence, about 2/3rds of the way through, when Churchill rides the tube to talk person-to-person with average British citizens riding the train -- it comes to life precisely at the same moment it sinks into clichÃ©, and credulity is strained past the breaking point. Ultimately, Oldman playing Churchill is the only thing that makes this movie experience worthwhile. (But Joe Wright has seen better days -- especially in his 2007 masterpiece, 'Atonement', the extraordinary film that incidentally introduced 12-year-old Saoirse Ronan to the world.) Not much better than a BBC-TV movie of the week.",6,7,12,26 March 2018
Zootopia," The funniest and most relevant animated feature in years!
","'Zootopia' (for some reason known as 'Zootropolis' in Europe) is a Disney computer animated film that takes place in a mammalian utopia in which all its animals, predatory and non-predatory, live together peacefully.A sophisticated merging of utopian science fiction with a gumshoe detective story, this relates the unlikely partnership between a pint-sized rabbit police officer and a red fox con artist as they uncover a conspiracy involving disappearing animals. It's also a hilarious movie, maybe even more so to adults than children, with one sequence that could be considered the funniest sequence ever put in an animated film. (Those who've seen 'Zootopia' know what I'm talking about.) This has everything a great animated feature could have: intriguing plot, adorable characters, uproarious comedy, emotional resonances, and a moralistic theme. And some of the best animation ever seen in a cartoon feature. Voiced by Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons and Octavia Spencer, with Ginnifer Goodman perfect as the voice of the rabbit cop Judy Hopps, this is Disney's 55th animated feature, and an indubitable masterpiece in the art of animation. Cartoon enthusiast or not, this is required viewing for every movie lover.",10,6,10,5 March 2017
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's best film in years
","I'm not a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino, although I appreciate his best work. The last film of his I felt achieved greatness was 'Jackie Brown' (still his finest film), and the last ones I liked were the two 'Kill Bill' films. I'm pleased to admit I found 'The Hateful Eight' his best in years. It's not perfect (too long, and hampered by some unnecessary campiness where it should have stayed serious), but it's a powerful character-driven, small 'chamber film' (ironic, as it was filmed in 70mm Ultra Panavision, i.e., Cinerama) relating a western tale with eight certifiably hateful characters interacting with each other in verbal power plays like wicked game pieces.Most of its drama takes place in a stagecoach lodge called 'Minnie's Haberdashery' where they have taken refuge from a powerful blizzard (these indoor scenes having been filmed on a soundstage in Los Angeles). The sequences not shot in the cabin were actually filmed on location in the beautiful Wilson Mesa area of the Colorado Rockies in extreme conditions of freezing wind and snow, and the stunning visuals, especially in 70mm, are gorgeous to behold. The film has a great cast: some Tarantino regulars, some new, with Kurt Russell as a bounty hunter carrying a handcuffed fugitive (Jennifer Jason Leigh at her filthiest) on the way to her hanging, but each of the eight has his or her own secrets and hidden agenda. Though violent at times beyond the pale (not a surprise for Tarantino!), it is a compelling drama throughout.Ultimately, it might have more style than substance (it seems rather shallow upon analysis), but its style and dramatic structure -- at times almost Shakespearean -- makes this a worthy cinematic experience, even when not seen in 70mm.",8,4,11,6 March 2016
"I, Tonya"," Engrossing comic biographical film - and wonderfully entertaining!
","'I, Tonya', a portrait of infamous Olympic ice skater Tonya Harding, is one of 2017's most entertaining films. Directed by Craig Gillespie, it is an iconoclastic biographical comedy that is a brilliant mix of mockumentary-style film clips and interviews interspersed with dramatic sequences, figure skating scenes, and humorous moments in which the actors break the fourth wall and talk to the audience.The acting is incredible. Australian Margot Robbie has finally nabbed her most important role playing Harding masterfully, but it might be Allison Janney as Harding's sadistic, abusive mother LaVona that might be burned into your memory the most. Real-life villains this memorably heartless are rare for seasoned actors to find. I daresay one look at a photo of Janney in the part with her steely crow's eyes staring through cycloid eyeglasses, oxygen tubes in her nose, short choppy boyish hair, and wearing a seedy old fur with a grumpy parrot perched on her shoulder, and you'll never forget her.Beautifully scripted as well as directed, the key to the film's success might be its editing that superbly forms a cohesive biographical portrait allowing us deep into Tonya Harding's skin, something that might make one pause. Yet while the film is fair in portraying her flaws, it takes no cheap shots, and shows admiration for her tenacity and skill. Don't miss this.",9,0,0,22 March 2018
Life of Pi," A Magnificent Cinematic Experience not to be Missed!
","Ang Lee isn't thought of as an Asian auteur in the class of Wong Kar-wai, Zhang Yimou or Lee Chang-dong. He's actually more of a commercial director than a personal artist, but what he does in this masterpiece is miraculous.Perhaps no director has ever captured the beauty and fear of the power of life, and when you look deep into the eyes of the tiger 'Richard Parker', you see what Marlowe saw in Kurtz's eyes in Conrad's 'The Heart of Darkness': a power so vast it dwarfs you into an awareness of your mortality, showing you your own inescapable insignificance beside the powers of all life.The acting is wonderful, primarily Infan Khan, one of India's greatest actors who plays the adult Pi. Khan provides an entire acting course just in the way he uses his face, displaying a smile in the film's climax that rivals the Mona Lisa's in its ambiguity. You see the world of pain, guilt, joy and sadness in his delicate expression.While the film is supremely spiritual in every frame, if one is paying attention, it winds up as somewhat of a Trojan Horse in what it ultimate reveals about religion. I'm not going to provide a spoiler here, but there are five words spoken by the adult Pi at the end of the film that viewers seem to miss that spell it out.But moving away from its theme, no film I have ever seen in my life comes close to 'Life of Pi' in relating the sheer force of nature (making you really experience first-hand the beauty and terror in the soul of a tiger) and the cosmic splendor of our world, both inner and outer. Using 3-D more brilliantly (and essentially) than any film to date, this film burned into my mind incredible visual sights impossible to find anywhere else, showing me beauty I will remember the rest of my life. 10/10.",10,0,2,26 October 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," An amazing character study of grief in a small Mid-Western town
","My favorite film of 2008 was 'In Bruges', the directing debut of Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, and now McDonagh furthers his art with his third film, 'Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri', a sort of dark comic crime film that is really a complex character study of a disgruntled mother upset at a town's failure to solve the murder of her teenage daughter to the point she rents three billboards outside the town to call attention to the unsolved murder. Frances McDormand plays the grieving divorced mother, Mildred Hayes, in a performance that might even surpass her Oscar-winning role in the Coen Brothers' 1996 'Fargo'. She's cynical, angry at the core, street-smart while flawed, and her inner journey is rightly the film's main focus. But she isn't the only character sketch that fascinates in this film. Two other characters display important moral arcs: the town sheriff Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson, surprisingly the most likeable) and, most significantly, Officer Dixon (a career best performance by Sam Rockwell that seems the film's most memorable). The movie's brilliant wit and marvelous interactive dialogue is matched by McDonagh's handling of the actors and control of the visual style, while keeping the humanity of the characters at the forefront as he deftly manages to circumvent the clichÃ©s always found in these kind of movies. Highly recommended as a remarkably composed portrait of small town America, it sends viewers out of the theater to contemplate moral questions concerning justice, revenge, anger and forgiveness. It is one of the year's most entertaining movies.",9,2,4,17 March 2018
American Sniper," A well-made film that misses on doing justice to American veterans
","Clint Eastwood's 'American Sniper' supposedly tells the true story of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, a soldier who has become a legend for killing over 160 Iraqis during his three tours of duty in Iraq. I am so ambivalent about this film because on one hand it's superbly made (with first-rate performances by Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller); on the other hand, it strikes me as insultingly oversimplified in its portrayal of socio-political conditions during the Iraq 'war' as well as barely touching on the serious psychological effects returning veterans have had to deal with. Moreover, its screenplay by Jason Hall used too much 'artistic license' -- for example, in real life Kyle never engaged a sniper-antagonist named 'Mustafa' (an actual sniper killed somewhere else) -- and Hall deceitfully sanitizes Kyle (who bordered on being sociopathic in his callous and joking attitude to his many kills).The worst thing about the film, however, is the patronizing and jingoistic last sequence of Kyle's memorial service, ending the film just like a commercial for the armed services. In the theater at which I saw it, many veterans (who have been deservedly proud of their service) began shouting and egging other audience members into loudly chanting over and over as the end credits rolled, 'U.S.A.! U.S.A!' as if it were a sporting event (during which time I had to suppress my own very different thoughts at the Bush administration that put them there). Here, the film was reaching far beyond honoring Kyle but pushed it to hero-worship. I think veterans like Kyle deserve a less clichÃ©d, more nuanced portrait of the sacrifices they made, including an accurate detailing of the psychological damage veterans had to cope with after coming home. This part of his real story was virtually ignored, only hinted at (e.g., in the scene of the family dog). Eastwood should have been more concerned with ending on the tragic human cost over any patriotic sloganeering for people to cheer at.",6,0,16,25 February 2015
The Revenant," An existential tale of survival and revenge by the great Iñárritu
","Adapting the mostly true experiences of fur trapper Hugh Glass that took place in Montana and South Dakota in 1823, 'The Revenant' is an amazing existential tale of survival and revenge that'll leave you feeling gutted and skinned, thanks to the remarkable vision and cinematic artistry of the great Alejandro G. Iñárritu, the director of last year's multi-Oscar-winning 'Birdman', and who has just won his second Best Director Oscar for 'The Revenant'. He was also the Mexican genius who gave us three narrative-juggling films of great humanism: 'Amores Perros', '21 Grams' and 'Babel', the latter I consider his masterpiece.Forget the stories of its difficult production (being filmed in authentic remote and bitter cold locations), and how star Leonardo DiCaprio actually suffered throughout by being immersed in freezing water, stuffed into a horse carcass or actually consuming a bison liver, what you'll bear witness to on the screen will pull you completely into its stark, ruthless, primal world and hold you there, thanks to DiCaprio's career-best performance as the film's protagonist which justifiably earned him his first Best Actor Oscar. The film is long (arguably too long) and unrelentingly slow, but few viewers will find themselves bored due to its calculated hypnotic pull, completely enwrapping viewers in its frozen world almost as much as Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia' put us in the desert. Above all, it has two sequences that will stay with you forever: the grizzly bear attack which occurs, as do many sequences, in one seemingly single long take -- but I found even more effective the first Indian assault. That scene delivers such brutal realism I actually felt terrified as never before in a movie theater due to the scene's directorial staging of the trappers' panicking while the Indians' arrows frenetically strike the men's flesh with the force of stinging missiles. This scene makes every other Indian attack I've ever seen in a film postured and artificial.Iñárritu is a Mexican genius, born in 1963, who managed to build up an extensive amount of cultural experiences through early travels, beginning at age 17 by crossing the Atlantic on a cargo ship then working his way across Europe and Africa. After his journeys, he returned to Mexico City, majored in communication, then began a career as a radio station host interviewing rock stars and hosting live concerts while single-handedly building WFM into the number one station in Mexico. All these experiences apparently became the source of his eclectic filmography, beginning with writing and directing a famous Mexican TV pilot, 'Behind the Money', and making a few short films before beginning his feature career with 'Amores Perros' in 2000. His best work conveys a cinematic exuberance close to a Mahler symphony in its scope, forming a synthesis of despair and joyfulness in rendering the human experience. 'The Revenant' finds him at his most obsessive and committed during its long shoot in a way reminiscent of the epics of David Lean: an 80-day principal photographic schedule in the coldest weather at locations so remote it required more than nine months in unbearably torturous conditions, all due to Iñárritu's refusal to use computer-generated imagery (saving the few effects scenes that necessitated it). The director's monomania for realism became so intolerable that many crew members walked off the project (or were fired), and Tom Hardy wound up attacking the director, nearly strangling him. The efforts of Iñárritu (and his collaborators) can be seen in the final production.Cinematographer Emmaunuel Lubezki (whose nickname is 'Chivo' which means 'goat' in Spanish) has an affinity with this director (he won an Oscar for Iñárritu's 'Birdman' before winning one for 'The Revenant'). After tests on 35mm and 65mm film stock, Lubezki and director Iñárritu decided to shoot 'The Revenant' on 6K high-resolution digital to be able to schedule one more hour of shooting time per day, almost exclusively in natural light for authenticity. And since lensing Alfonso Cuarón's 'Children of Men', Chivo has been justifiably famous for long unbroken takes (in fact, most of 'Birdman' is constructed as if its entire drama is uninterrupted by a cut), and he continues that tradition, if in a less obvious fashion, with 'The Revenant' in its Indian assault and grizzly bear attack..Though the film ultimately does not attain formal perfection, I left the theater carrying a new life experience unlike anything I'd seen before, achieved through Iñárritu's singular vision conveying a quintessential portrait of the American wilderness with great cinematic poetry. One of the year's most significant achievements in film.",9,1,4,4 March 2016
Dunkirk," An emperor without clothes, a film hugely overrated
","Of all the films in 2017, the biggest disappointment to me was Christopher Nolan's over-packaged and over-publicized 'Dunkirk', a film with aspirations of grandeur that ended up delivering a narrative mishmash that completely lacked emotional involvement. My guess is that the film, displaying choppy editing and confusing transitions, might have been the compromised result of its filmmakers changing their minds while frantically trying to mold it into something cohesive. Watching it, at times I didn't even know where I was supposed to be, and at one point I turned to a friend who had accompanied me and asked, 'why is it night here?' without realizing until later we had been seemingly in the hold of a ship. Moreover, it seemed an attempt was made to cover the narrative weakness by having actor Kenneth Branaugh stand around and deliver hackneyed lines (written by director Nolan himself) to take the place of dramatic action, scenes that seemed phoned in from another movie. But a more surprising weakness was the failure of the flying scenes to work up much excitement. Why its aviation scenes were so timidly done and so lacking in intensity, even in 70mm, astounds me still. Finally, when the end credits came up on 'Dunkirk', due to its need for more 'fleshing out' and clarity of focus, I felt I had experienced merely the outline of a movie instead of a completed one. And a war film that seemed to fail at the very simple things that even average war films used to achieve with ease.",4,2,3,17 March 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," As far as Wes Anderson goes, one either gets him or one doesn't. I don't.
","'The Grand Budapest Hotel', Wes Anderson's most successful film to date, is visually enthralling, every frame a veritable art museum painting (and not just on the level of 'Boy with Apple'), cleverly utilizing glass-paintings and CGI-enhanced locations in Germany and Poland actually to the level of picture postcards. That may also be its problem. As interesting as the film would seem to be theoretically, it seems as hollow and superficial as a picture postcard. Its extraordinary cast members (which includes 11 previous Oscar nominees and 5 Oscar winners) posture themselves like mannequins throughout a fast-paced exercise that feels no deeper than an elaborate puppet show. Admittedly, I've had a long-term aversion to Anderson's 'style', so annoying in its contrived stance of false naiveté. While overwhelmed by the beauty in every sequence, I search in vain for the least empathy with a single character and any emotion beyond the superficial. Many swoon over this film, but its adoration to me makes more sense on a sociological level in sync with the Twitter and Instagram sound-bite age we live in. As I said to a good friend (who's a Wes Anderson fan) after we left the theater, 'How could anyone spend so much money on such a marvelous cast and such gorgeous images and produce something so shallow and emotionless?' I'm still waiting for the answer.",3,11,19,25 February 2015
Beasts of No Nation," One of the most visceral film experiences of 2015
","'Beasts of No Nation' is one of 2015's most realistic and visceral films, an unforgettable drama detailing the experiences of a young boy named Agu who is forced into joining a group of child soldiers trained into become guerrilla killers during Nigeria's civil war. This shattering film, beautifully shot in Ghana and starring Idris Elba, was directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, a Californian born to a Japanese-American father who had been imprisoned in an internment camp during WWII. Fukunaga uses an uncompromising style that pulls no punches in showing the explicit brutal violence these children are brainwashed into committing. Although extremely graphic, ultimately it moves the viewers' hearts toward deep compassion over the children's loss of innocence, but also toward the hope for their redemption.Fukunaga also photographed the film himself when the original DP sustained a serious injury. He not only brought a beauty to the horrendous Nigerian war-time settings, but based its look from photojournalists' coverage of the Second Liberian Civil War, and coloring the film personally to reproduce 1970's photo-chemical film stock.Without question, this film is an important document of man's inhumanity to man that we should not cover our eyes and ignore. Fukunaga's past directorial work includes 'Sin Nombre', the 2009 critically-acclaimed feature of Honduran immigrants trying to illegally cross the American border, and the first season of the TV series, 'True Detective', but this film is his finest work to date. Fukunaga spent over seven years working on it, and its best sequences visually bring to mind a young Stanley Kubrick, especially in its latter scenes of great colorful poetry. Because it premiered on Netflix (it bought the worldwide distribution rights), most of the big theater chains boycotted it, so it only had a limited theater release but that's where it should be seen, and on the biggest screen possible, but you'll probably have to watch it at home.",10,3,4,4 March 2016
Get Out," Not what it first appears to be -- and an instant classic!
","It was my second viewing of Jordan Peele's independent little film, 'Get Out', that grabbed me. On my first viewing I was lulled into complacency while lazily taking in the first half of the film, the kind of complacency the film ultimately squelches. I had conveniently forgotten the short pre-credit sequence of a casual black man walking through a white suburb at night being struck and abducted into the trunk of a car. Everybody does, and when it catches up with you, you know it. Previously a comedian, this is writer/director/producer Peele's directorial debut, and he gives us the African-American nastiness of a Hitchcock, palming his aces to play in the last half hour of the film with the relish of the Master. The set up: a young black man is pressured by his white girlfriend into meeting her parents by spending a weekend at their secluded estate in the woods. What follows is a gradual descent into nightmare as he intermingles with upper class white liberals who bring out the paranoia in him - or do they have their own agenda? (Remember even paranoids have real enemies.) Watching this film might enlighten white liberals like myself by forcing us to experience what black people have felt for years in our company (let alone among white conservative racists!), but the film goes much further than one might imagine, even taking the form of a horror fable encompassing not just racial themes but also serving as an uncompromisingly astute societal dissection. Shot in a mere 23 days, Jordan Peele has done something really special here: an engrossing thriller that also bravely delves into important issues, issues that Peele himself has had to deal with personally: e.g., the marginalizing of African-Americans ('No matter how hard we scream, the system silences us,' Peele says). But don't get me wrong: This is a work of entertainment, not a 'message' film -- and that's all to the good.",9,21,42,8 March 2018
Selma," A momentous story made into a nearly perfect film
","'Selma' is 90% of a great film. It tells the true story of a three month period in 1965 when Martin Luther King, Jr. led his famous march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to secure equal voting rights against violent opposition. The period is skillfully recreated, generally knowing exactly what to center the drama on, wisely much more than on King himself but on the entire community and how so many came together to alter history.In spite of the film's impact (especially in the violent scenes between the police and the protesters) and some great performances, the script by Paul Webb inserts a fictitious clash between King and President Lyndon Johnson in order to add a conflict to the film. This has drawn much criticism but, more than doing a disservice to LBJ (who reportedly did not impede putting forward the voting rights bill), it also reveals that Webb and director DuVernay did not feel there was enough dramatic conflict inherent in the story without it. One can legitimately argue either way, but in my opinion it would have been better to further emphasize the interaction of all the participants more without 'hyping' the LBJ conflict. Even if the film had been less 'dramatic' in a classical sense it would have been more accurate as well as effective. Still, this film is a must-see and a significant document of a crucial time in the history of America.",8,5,9,27 February 2015
Sicario," Another masterpiece by Canada's greatest filmmaker, Denis Villeneuve!
","Arguably the best film of 2015 is Canadian Denis Villeneuve's electrifying and morally-ambiguous portrait of the war against drugs on the border between the US and Mexico, 'Sicario', a telling of the rite-of-passage of an idealistic and inexperienced FBI agent, superbly played by Emily Blunt, recruited to join a covert government team to bring down one of Mexico's most dangerous drug barons. She's accompanied by the team's leader, expertly played by Josh Brolin, a tough practical guy who believes the end justifies the means, and has no qualms about ignoring any laws that stand in his way. Also with them is a Mexican assassin played by Benicio Del Toro who has his own agenda. ('Sicario' derives from the Latin word, 'Sicarius', meaning 'dagger man'; also 'hit man' in Spanish.) Villeneuve's past work comprises some of the finest films made the last few years (e.g., 'Incendies', 'Prisoners', and 'Enemy') and 'Sicario' is a tour-de-force of brilliant technique used to develop character as well as to encourage viewers into questioning their own moral choices in following proper laws or circumventing them for expediency. One critic called this film 'a punch to the gut' and it most certainly achieves that while never losing its grip on the audience, its action heightened by Roger Deakins' evocative cinematography utilizing the finest aerial tracking shots I have ever seen, along with crackerjack editing, and a pulse-pounding electronic music score by Icelandic composer, Jóhann Jóhannsson. Described by its director as 'a dark poem,' it is a tough, virtually perfect thriller that will stimulate your brain while gluing you to your seat.As far as its music score which skillfully blends acoustic and electronic sounds with harmonic and dissonant minimalist music, Jóhannsson shows himself to be one of the truly great original film composers today. He has been scoring films in his native Iceland for over 15 years until writing a brilliantly evocative soundtrack music for Denis Villeneuve's 2013 'Prisoners', and now, also for Villeneuve, 'Sicario'. While making the film, the director told Jóhannsson to 'create sounds that you wouldn't only hear but that you could also feel,' and the composer managed that by using simple ambient sounds to music that rhythmically employed lots of percussion and unusual guitar and cello tones creatively, often so subtle as to seem subliminal. The end effect is disturbing and haunting, allowing the music to complement Villeneuve's visuals and the film's editing patterns perfectly.In summary, the hypnotic and visceral 'Sicario' is a suspense thriller that you cannot afford to miss.",10,1,4,1 March 2016
Les Misérables," I found myself one of 'Les Miserables'!
","Tom Hooper's movie of 'Les Miserables' is by far the biggest disappointment of the year and, in fact, one of the year's worst films. It wouldn't have been this way if the worthy project had been given to a different director.The original stage musical has been justifiably loved by many and won many awards in its various languages. Though flawed by its paucity of melodic creativity (there seems to be one song that keeps reappearing throughout with small variations) and a tendency toward over-bloating the material (Javert dies not from an ignominious death in a canal but a leap from a height that rivals the top of Mount Everest), the original musical was a masterpiece of adaptation from the Victor Hugo novel.The movie captures that accurately and perhaps beautifully but the beloved property has been undermined and eventually destroyed by the most incoherent and pedestrian film direction I've witnessed in at least a decade. In short, the film is a mess due to Tom Hooper's insistence of dizzying, relentless close-ups of grotesque singing faces spasmodically darting about, and his total inability to place two or three people into an organized and meaningful composed shot. Establishing shots are completely absent, and no attention seems paid to any visual relationships between characters, the organizing of which is a prerequisite for any director.One searches in vain for any intelligent use of space here, as Hooper haphazardly frames faces off-center, too high or too low, as if a child or a disabled grandparent inadvertently picked up the camera and aimed it without being able to see its image through the viewfinder.In the hands of a competent director a simple conversation (or a duet) between two lovers can be a thing of significance and beauty in which we experience one lover declaring love at the same time we experience the reactions of the other lover simply listening, but here all we get is one face at a time repeatedly shoved into our mugs in an assault as if an out-of-control jack-in-the-box puppet is out to get us. This is no way to convey the subtlety or sensitivity of a marvelous property like this epic musical. It only remains to see if the aficionados of the original have the good sense (and the imagination) to realize what this film could have been -- and how much they've been short-changed as well as dishonored.Sorry this functions as a mere footnote, but a word needs to be said about the singing. In essence, some are inadequate for the task (Crowe's weakness bothers me less than Jackman's irritatingly uncontrollable vibrato) but a few are marvelous (like Samantha Barks and David Heddlestone). However, it is truly Anne Hathaway's earnestness and heart-felt singing that towers over the rest of the movie.And in the future I can only hope that any project I value doesn't fall into the bungling hands of Mr. Hooper!",1,0,3,26 October 2014
The Shape of Water," A beautiful adult fairy tale by the brilliant director of 'Pan's Labyrinth'
","Guillermo del Toro is today's master of fantasy, having been a childhood lover of monsters growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico, before making some of the finest films of recent years -- from the ghostly horror of 'The Devil's Backbone' in 2001 to his gothic horror/romance, 'Crimson Peak' in 2015. Indubitably, however, his greatest film is 'Pan's Labyrinth', the 2006 film many of us consider the finest fantasy film ever made. Now he's broken new ground with 'The Shape of Water', one of 2017's most beautiful films. Set in Baltimore in the year 1962 at the height of the Cold War, the plot follows a mute janitor at a secret government laboratory who forms a bond with a captured amphibian of the 'Creature of the Black Lagoon' variety. Her name is Elisa, and Sally Hawkins plays her with an artistry that seems to reach back to the silent days of Chaplin and Keaton. Michael Shannon, with devoted viciousness, plays the right-wing Colonel Strickland, someone more interested in dissecting the creature for exploitation purposes than he is concerned over the space race with the Soviets. There are also elements of religious allegory ('We're created in the Lord's image. You don't think that's what the Lord looks like, do you?'). Del Toro saw 'The Creature from the Black Lagoon' on TV at 7 years old and it changed his life. Wishing a different ending for it in which the Gill Man and co-star Julie Adams would consummate their romance and live 'happily ever after', he wrote various scripts of a remake through the years that Universal studio executives wound up rejecting. 'The Shape of Water' is the result of del Toro's dream, and now today, with more permissive filmmaking allowable, he's able to deal with the previously verboten issue between fish and human. The resulting film is a worthy accomplishment not only for its production design (embodying various shades of green) and its special effects, but also for attaining the level of a genuine adult fairy tale that deals with issues of trust, tolerance, and love in the human condition -- but most of all what it's like to be an outsider (whether a lonely mute woman, gay man, overweight black woman, or an amphibious sea creature). 'This is a healing movie for me,' del Toro states; one likes to think it would be for viewers as well.",10,48,90,20 March 2018
American Made," One of 2017's most underrated films is a great entertainment
","Doug Liman's entertaining 'American Made' tells the somewhat true story of Barry Seal, a former TWA pilot, who, during the 1980's, was 'coerced' into flying spy missions for the CIA before becoming a drug smuggler for a Colombian drug cartel. Then, to avoid prison, he becomes an informant for the DEA, and winds up slipping further and further into a complex web of nefarious enterprises that makes it virtually impossible for him to get out of. Playing Seal with a flippant sarcasm, Tom Cruise displays the multi-leveled range of a superior character actor, but what really makes this film work is Liman's tightrope-balancing act between outrageous humor and the serious, even dangerous, reality of Seal's situation. In fact, the film brings to mind the best of Martin Scorsese's work, e.g., 'Goodfellas', or, more precisely, Scorsese's less accomplished 'Wolf of Wall Street'. Particularly notable is the film's digital photography that employs an exaggerated sun-drenched color saturation to the point of comic-book surrealism. Although taking liberty with the facts (Seal did not crash-land into a suburban neighborhood), this is a cinematic ride that ranks with the best action thrillers of recent years. And how it eventually leads into the Iran-Contra criminal escapades of the Reagan Administration in 1986 should provide an eye-opening history lesson to viewers who may not know much about that shady era in American history. (Interesting trivia: Cruise actually does his own flying in the film.) A first-rate entertainment, and Liman's career best.",10,4,7,17 March 2018
Whiplash," An independent masterpiece that will make you feel assaulted
","'Whiplash', an independent film shot in 19 days, was one of the genuine pleasures of 2014 in film, telling the story of a promising young jazz drummer named Andrew at a prestigious music conservatory in New York being driven to manic ambition by a sadistic conductor/instructor named Terrence Fletcher. But it's so much more than a Faustian morality drama in functioning as a metaphor for the choice of reaching for the highest fame and success or being happy with the simple joys of life.It stars J.K. Simmons who reminds me of the great George C. Scott in that his performance here as a sadistic college band instructor is almost as intense in displaying unleashed machismo as Scott did playing General Patton. At this writing, the 2015 Oscars haven't been given out yet, but Simmons couldn't lose the Oscar if he dropped his pants on Hollywood Boulevard.Writer/director Damien Chazelle drew from his own experiences in High School (hopefully exaggerated!) to make a film that virtually assaults the viewer as if he were a punching bag continuously being pummeled by an enraged boxer. After an almost unbearable nine-minute drumming climax, the viewer will probably stagger out into the street, then spend days getting over the experience. By pushing the envelope almost to the unendurable, Chazelle has carved a cinematic masterpiece.",9,1,3,20 February 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Iñárritu gives us another eccentric masterpiece
","Alejandro González Iñárritu's brilliant tour-de-force, 'Birdman', is a most audacious dark comedy about a cinematic ex-superhero trying to make a comeback with a Broadway play, but that's only the setup. It's unorthodox to a flaw: many will find getting up to speed difficult with its hyper-kinetic madcap burst of verbal fencing amongst its cornucopia of stars (all at the top of their game), headed by Michael Keaton playing the title character.I deeply love Iñárritu as a filmmaker. His best work conveys a cinematic exuberance that comes close to a Mahler symphony in its scope, forming a synthesis of despair and joyfulness in rendering the human experience. He's made five films to date, each of which won countless awards at Cannes, Venice, the Golden Globes and Academy Award nominations. His first three films comprise a trilogy utilizing intersecting stories, the best of which, 'Babel' (released in 2006) took a year to shoot in four different countries, and begins with a sheepherder and his two sons in North Africa and culminates with a deaf and dumb naked teenage girl in a penthouse at the top of a skyscraper in Tokyo. It won Iñárritu Best Director at Cannes, and is still Iñárritu's masterpiece. 'Birdman', however, is a complete about-face from the triptych epic to a simpler, more focused drama with tour-de-force directing that shows him at the peak of his powers.Iñárritu's camera moves everywhere, gliding and flying about (as if the entire film is virtually one long single take), following actors' movements, going through doorways, behind stages, into the street, even up to the roof and beyond -- while a soundtrack of drums underscores the action like the nervous approach of an intracranial hemorrhage. This is a film that demands much of its viewers, but the intelligent ones who allow themselves to sink into the marvelous mosaic of the experience will find something to revel in, and eagerly want to revisit after getting their breath back. A rich, extravagant celebration in cinema that fully deserved the 2015 Oscar for Best Picture.",10,15,28,25 February 2015
Mother!," A shocking film that the right people will love
","Going further in the unconventional department, 'mother!' is many viewers' cup of hemlock, and without question 2017's most revolutionary, and perhaps offensive, film. Unfortunately I cannot say much without spoiling the whole thing so I need to skirt around its plot and, even more carefully, its meaning. Perhaps one might label it a psychological horror film but that is so inadequate since, as its 'meaning' becomes clear (if the viewer ever does figure it out), it truly becomes something else. Directed at high intensity by the formidable Darren Aronofsky (whose previous best was probably 2008's 'The Wrestler', though 'mother!' more resembles his earlier nightmare, 'Requiem of a Dream'), its basic plot follows a young nameless woman (Jennifer Lawrence) who seems to have a tranquil life with her husband (also unnamed, played by Javier Bardem) until their country home is disrupted by the arrival of a mysterious couple (Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer). They are also unnamed. The film proceeds slowly at first - almost exclusively from the woman's point of view - gathering pitch until all hell breaks out, and we are truly in the world of Hieronymus Bosch, although 'earthly delights' will not be forthcoming. I loved every minute of this nightmare, god help me, but most of all when the pieces began to come together after my second viewing, something which some viewers might feel t'would constitute a medieval torture far worse than being drawn and quartered. Without being able to detail it any further, I want to emphasize how important this film is as a work of art and how, if strong stomach permits, you really need to give it multiple viewings. Praised around the world by many critics, it was also booed at its premiere at the 74th Venice Film Festival (along with a strong standing ovation). Although misanthrope critic Rex Reed gave the film 'zero stars', many acclaimed it, most notably filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who ecstatically raved, 'Only a true, passionate filmmaker could have made this picture, which I'm still experiencing weeks after I saw it.' Brilliant in every way, and a masterpiece of surrealism, Dadaism, radicalism and Lewis Carroll-ism. And if you see it and manage to unlock its levels of meaning and the impact of it starts to seep into your consciousness, you might need to lie down on your local psychiatrist's couch.",10,1,5,17 March 2018
Her," Spike Jonze gives us a lot more than a romantic comedy!
","'Her' is a very rich and profound romantic sci-fi comedy about a lonely man whose job is to write love letters for other lonely souls yet finds himself 'involved' with the advanced operating system he's purchased to run his life. Writer-director Spike Jonze has taken this idea, miraculously mated Frank Capra with Franz Kafka sans cynicism, and turned out a gem of a film that is much more than a social critique of how much electronics has taken over our lives. It's really about human relationships.A viewer can be forgiven for thinking on first viewing that Spike Jonze's 'Her' is mainly about our socio-political obsession with technology and the advantages and disadvantages of falling in love with a computerized non-human. In fact, neither of these is the film's most important subject. In relating the main character's 'romantic' entanglement with an operating system, the film actually functions -- in accurate psychological detail -- as a dissection of a real human relationship, as it proceeds -- almost clinically -- through each of its stages, from initial excitement at meeting the other, the honeymoon, the jealous stage, the gradual disillusionment, and the breakup. Like 'Vertigo', 'Shame', 'Titanic' and 'Rain Man', 'Her' is one of those movies that contains, underneath its surface, a charting of the development of a damaged human being out of a private prison of impotence or enslavement towards liberation, and the possibility of a healthy human relationship. In fact, its veneer of light entertainment deceptively misdirects one away from its serious human subject.The lonely writer Theodore is locked in his protective world from the beginning of the film perfectly at home with releasing the romantic feelings of which he has denied himself through his job by writing love letters for strangers to send to their own (perhaps superficial) lovers. And throughout the film he is seen peering at the outside world from high apartments through windows, the pane of glass symbolizing the barrier that prevents him from intimate human contact.The world Theodore is living in (and we, as well) is a world in which technology has gone beyond convenience to have become monstrous methods of escape as well as permanent alienation from direct human face-to-face interaction. Throughout the film we follow Theodore as he struts and spins through malls and various physical spaces, talking only to his operating system, focused on his cellphone and the other devices that bring 'her' to him, living only in an obsessive romantic relationship with the 'being' with whom or what he has become infatuated.At the end of the film, after journeyed through the different steps in his relationship with 'Samantha' to the point he is 'dumped' by 'her', he has progressed into standing up straight on the roof of the high office building, finally without glass windows or any obstacle to separate him from the open world, signifying his own victorious emerging out of his prison. Like John Ferguson at the end of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', Theodore is now at the beginning of his being able to approach a real intimacy with a real human being -- not an idealistic fantasy or a computerized pseudo-human.Although centering on a male falling in love with an artificial 'her', the film also contains, as a secondary story that we must fill in ourselves, a female becoming 'intimate' with an artificial 'her' in the character of Amy who apparently goes through a similar experience as Theodore. At the end of the film we find both the male and female sitting on the rooftop together, good friends for life (plainly platonic not romantic), both looking out over the world in front of them without physical barriers, ready for the beginning of human love with some 'other', without psychological barriers.One could build a case for 'Samantha' being ultimately Theodore's true therapist, for the growth 'she' gently leads him through in the film's narrative is virtually identical in its stages to what a real therapist does, but in a more personal and direct way.Ironically, while this film began as a picture of a destructive society controlled by a technology that impedes human contact, the end of this film shows -- after 'Samantha' has gently mentored Theodore (and us) into a world of healthy human intimacy -- it to be a film of hope. 'Samantha' has seemingly advanced to such a level that 'she' is able to see the problems of the technological society 'she' was 'born' into, and to ingeniously work out a viable type of therapy that will begin to cure the Theodores and the Amys of our problematic society.",9,0,1,25 May 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," George Miller's full-throttle magnum opus is one of the finest films of the action genre
","Mad Max: Fury Road' is 70-year-old Australian George Miller's magnum opus, and the crowning achievement of his 'Mad Max' saga which previously comprised three earlier films made between 1979 and 1985 with Mel Gibson playing the lead. The first two, 'Mad Max' and 'Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior' were rather cheap independent films that built a cult; the third one, 'Mad Max Beyond Thunder-dome' was a misguided expensive film that aimed but failed to do what 'Fury Road' succeeds at. This one is a totally mad adrenaline-rush of an action film that will not only leave one breathless by its over-the-top stunt-filled explosive sequences, but, whether a fan of the older films or not, viewers should be blown right out of their seats in awe at the poetically-perfect execution of its filmmaking brilliance.But what makes it even more special, and what truly earns it the masterpiece epithet, is the creation of the richest and most memorable female action character since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa. Standing statuesque and sporting one metallic arm, she is a macho man's wet dream of an amazon warrior, but underneath her fierce exterior is a sensitive woman with a heart that beats with compassion. What's more, she is the film's true protagonist, and leaves the character of Mad Max (played this time by Tom Hardy) as a second fiddle. Half way through the drama it should be apparent to most viewers that this movie, purportedly a violent, super-action testosteronic spectacle displaying more snarling body-painted warriors and explosive pyrotechnics than a Hell's Angels' nightmare, is actually a hyperbolized portrait of an independent woman's rebellion from a male-dominated world. In that sense, Miller has created a Trojan horse that puts down the very values it pretends to espouse, and helping to confirm this is a little-known fact that Eve Ensler (writer of 'The Vagina Monologues') was consulted in the film's portrayal of its female characters. What's more, every aspect of this film, from its film editing, production design, costumes, sound editing & mixing, is on a par with the greatest action films of all time. But, believe me, this is not just for violent action fans -- it's for every one who loves great filmmaking.",10,2,8,4 March 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson merges a vision of the hell of war and great human heroism, and it's a masterpiece!
","I had about as much interest in seeing a new film by Mel Gibson as I had in submitting to a root canal, but I found 'Hacksaw Ridge' a complete revelation and one of the best films of the year.Gibson has had a scattered directorial career since winning the Oscar in 1995 for his second film: the entertaining if overrated 'Braveheart'. In the following two decades he managed to direct only the sadistic and overwrought 'Passion of the Christ' in 2004 and his mystical visionary work, 'Apocalypto' in 2006. And now, after a ten year hiatus, he's given us what seems likely to remain his crowning achievement, the deeply-felt true story of World War II army medic Desmond Doss (played by Andrew Garfield), the conscientious objector who earned the Medal of Honor by saving dozens of his fellow soldiers in the Battle of Okinawa while refusing to even hold a weapon. Although the violence in this film is the most explicit and shocking of any war film ever made (it truly makes the opening battle at Omaha Beach in Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' a playground fistfight by comparison), in context it's never gratuitous or offensive. The horrendous battle scenes never drive viewers out of the theater for two reasons, both important cinematic principles. First, in the film's first half Gibson gets viewers so emotionally involved with the main character, particularly with the relationship with his father (Hugo Weaving) as well as with the woman he loves (Teresa Palmer), audiences will easily accept the subsequent scenes of hell by caring so much. Secondly, Gibson portrays the battle scenes like great frescoes -- with bloodied, limbless bodies exploding and flying about within moving tapestries like peripheral details within a Bosch triptych. What makes this production more astonishing is that 'Hacksaw Ridge' was an independent film produced on a relatively low budget, most of its battle scenes having been shot in New South Wales, Australia in an area not much larger than a football field.A noteworthy success on every technical level possible, with marvelous performances by the entire cast (most notably Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington), Gibson's achievement here is impossible to overrate. He has made not only one of the finest war films ever made, but also a cinematic chronicle that contrasts the bloodiest and most brutal acts of man's inhumanity to man with a profoundly moving, moralistic act of civilized human behavior amidst the worst hell of the human experience. This is a film not to miss.",10,5,8,22 February 2017
The Martian," Well-made and exciting, if lightweight entertainment from a great director
","I'm somewhat divided on the merits of 'The Martian'. As entertainment, it's smashing, particularly since it was directed by the master Ridley Scott ('Alien', 'Blade Runner', 'Gladiator', etc.) with fine acting by Matt Damon playing an American astronaut who survives a disastrous manned mission to Mars and must figure out a way to survive on Mars until he can be rescued.I'm split on this film because in spite of the film's excellent production, it lacks much that could be considered either depth, ideas to ponder, or even resonance, things Scott's lesser films usually provide. It actually resembles more of a lightweight pre-Schindler Spielberg film because it seems to settle into merely being a 'crowd pleaser,' much closer to 'Rocky' than to '2001: A Space Odyssey', though many might think that preferable. I also feel 'The Martian' has weaknesses as drama: it seems astonishing that our astronaut appears to work things out too easily with little going wrong (until the final rather unlikely 'rescue'), and he never exhibits any emotional or psychological problems, something rather unrealistic as well as dramatically sophomoric. Frankly, it needed a harder edge, even toward the 'darkly realistic', and I can't understand why Scott didn't flesh this out in the script unless its production was, at some point, rushed. Nevertheless, it is excellently made, a spectacular piece of movie entertainment that I thoroughly enjoyed, even if I didn't carry much away with me afterward.",7,0,0,9 March 2016
