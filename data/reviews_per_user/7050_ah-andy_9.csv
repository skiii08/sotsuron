The Hangover," Sweet!
","The movie talks about a bachelor party gone wrong when the groom goes missing in the middle of Las Vegas.The characters are different and you can relate to each one. You have the responsible yet loose Doug, the adventurous Phil, the 'adult' Stu, and the sick-o Alan.The movie has its moments, it's funny at times but gets a little lame when it's the same joke over and over again. The ending was kind of shocking since it was sudden and out of the blue the way they found Doug.However, it was fun. I enjoyed it and I will certainly be watching it again since it doesn't get old. You should watch it too if you haven't, and if you did, watch it again. Why not anyway?",7,3,4,1 January 2011
Public Enemies," Pretty entertaining!
","To be honest, I have no idea who John Dillinger or any of the characters in the movie are. However, I do know that it was fairly well written, the story was great, and the acting was terrific.Can't think of anyone that is more suitable for the role of John than JD; he portrayed him beautifully and made it believable. The secondary characters added to the story and made it all the more interesting and entertaining. I liked how the movie started, it got me attached to it; and also, how it ended, which was disappointing but nice.Overall, you should watch this movie, although it's kind of long.",8,0,0,27 December 2010
The Godfather: Part II," Well, thank god for Al Pacino.
","I wondered if the sequel would be as great without Marlon Brando, I wasn't sure if Al Pacino could fill in his shoes. And he didn't, nobody could. But, nonetheless, an astounding performance by Al Pacino.The story is sort of like the first one, with a bunch of guys chasing after the Don, which in this movie is Michael. And he, with his smart attitude, chases them down.I can't find anybody who didn't perform a terrific, ten over ten role. The cast was perfect and the script was well written. It matched the anticipation I had when I finished the first movie and was popping in the sequel.Everybody has aged a bit, and the writers did cut off a lot of characters from the first movie, characters that I thought were amazing, but I guess that makes it all the more realistic.You should all watch this movie, that is of course, if you liked the first one.",9,0,3,6 December 2010
BASEketball," Finally!
","Finally, a comedy that actually makes you laugh THROUGHOUT the whole movie! These days, it seems like most of the comedies are boring and lame, and don't really have jokes that make you laugh; it's all forced. But I actually laughed while watching BASEketball.The story is about two best friends who take a game that they created and and played in their backyard, to an official national sport. They then face problems along the way and try to solve them.The primary characters are Joe Cooper - played by Trey Parker - and Doug Remer - by Matt Stone. They are both portrayed splendidly and humourisly. The acting didn't lack anything and it was near perfect! Joe Cooper is the serious, responsible one that has his principles and goals. Whereas Doug Remer is the loose, spoiled one. In a way, they're a perfect match.The secondary characters are Jenna Reed - played by Yasmine Bleeth - and Squeak Scolari - by Dian Bachar. They add a lot to the story, and make it all the more better. Jenna works for a foundation that helps sick kids, and both Joe and Doug are attracted to her. Squeak is hilarious, and is Joe and Doug's teammate and friend.The story is unique, like the sport, and funny. It was really well written and produced. Certainly one to talk about for decades, and one of a kind.You should definitely watch this movie! It would be a waste if you don't, since it's one of the funniest movies ever.",9,2,2,1 January 2011
Tropic Thunder," Well thank god that's over!
","I started the movie with huge expectations and a thoughtful of imaginations, but I was deeply disappointed. This movie was not at all what I expected. No idea why I thought so strongly of it.The movie had its funny, interesting and weird/random moments, but those were rare. Lame script, acting and story dominated the whole movie and made it boring.Some things just weren't clarified, and weren't in the right place. Live that TiVo story. What's up with that? The idea however, was brilliant, and I think it could have been something huge and noticeable.There isn't much to review; unless you're into lame, long, and useless movies; there isn't really much gain from watching this one.",5,3,5,27 December 2010
The Godfather: Part III," Not as good as the first two.
","...and I sadly removed the last sequel of 'The Godfather' from my DVD player.It was a 'good' sequel, it contained all the elements that we look for when watching a movie related to the mafia. However, it wasn't as good as the first and second parts. It somehow the lacked the Godfather-ish atmosphere.I think that Andy Garcia plays a beautiful role, his temper and charm really adds to the feel of the movie.And of course, another terrific portrayal by Al Pacino. In this part, he has aged quite a bit, but that did not make his performance any worse. If anything, it made it harder since more acting was required.The story is well, another great Godfather one. The ending was, however, different. It was more emotional. But I liked it.What are you looking at me for? Go watch the movie.",8,0,1,7 December 2010
Defiance," I'm not sure.
","The movie is about a group of Jewish brothers who help a community of Jews against the Germans in WWII. Being interested in WWII, myself, it was good to look at it from a different angle, and not the massive bloody scenes the usual WWII movies are about.Both Daniel Craig, and Liev Schreiber deliver a terrific performance as two of the Bielski brothers. I enjoyed watching them work as they fight against the Germans and sickness.Since the movie talks about a true story, it really makes you want to put yourself in their shoes, and how great that group of combatants actually was.However, the movie is way too long with some scenes that are, also, way too long; and sometimes it just gets boring and made me want to multitask. In addition, some of the secondary characters' acting wasn't so great and made me chuckle.In the end, I don't see a reason why you shouldn't watch this movie.",7,0,1,28 December 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Brilliant!
","Having been interested in Sherlock Holmes for ages, this movie added heaps to my obsession to Holmes. Not only do they portray Sherlock perfectly, but they added a beautiful story to make it all the more interesting.I think Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law were perfect for the roles of Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson. The acting was marvelous and convincing. The secondary characters like Lord Blackwood were also portrayed nicely and they made the story better and better.The writing was well-written and smartly, I may add. The dialogs weren't corny but full of mystery. There were a couple of jokes here and there to lighten up the mood, but they were placed.I recommend you watch this movie if you fancy the crime-solving movies or books.",9,0,1,18 December 2010
The Godfather," Beautiful!
","The Godfather is, in a nutshell, a terrific movie.The cast is brilliant, from Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) to Diane Keaton (Kay Adams); each one of them suits their role perfectly.Marlon Brando is without a doubt, one of the best actors to ever set foot on this earth. His astonishing portrayal of Vito makes me sad that he's not going to appear in the sequels.Al Pacino also plays a beautiful role, one of Vito's sons who later takes on the family business. Notice how he transforms himself from this calm war-hero to a hard-ass Don. Not a lot of people can do that.I love how the movie - most of it at least - takes place in New York while most of the characters are Italian. But that only spices the movie up. The story is unique and smartly written, and it suits me since I like the time that it took place in.So if you're a fan of the post-WWII age, then I strongly urge you to get this movie. Hell, even if you're not, it would be a shame if you don't watch it.",9,1,1,1 December 2010
