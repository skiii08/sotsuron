Alien 3," Almost as good as the first film
","I'm probably a minority of one, but I think this is a great film. I just watched the 'Special Edition' from the box set yesterday, and it was like watching a different film to the 'Standard Edition'. It is the true, spiritual sequel to Alien. It's dark (both literally and metaphorically), with a great cast of characters played by 'proper' actors, with a gratuitously profane script with some Olympic-level swearing worthy of Quentin Tarantino. After the crash, bang wallop of John Camerons's Aliens, this is a far better movie.Here are the extra bits that IMDb demands; From the cast, Danny Webb deserves special mention as a cross between Patrick Malahide and a rat. Charles Dance is his usual smooth self with a pinch of menace, and Sigourney Weaver IS just as sexy as usual with a crew cut. Brian Glover and the 85 character make a great double-act - like a malevolent Morecambe and Wise.",9,4,53,20 June 2008
Marie Antoinette," First impressions can be wrong
","When I heard the first few bars of guitar during the introduction to this film I thought; 'oh no, an American teen movie disguised as a historical drama'. However, I was wrong; it is both, and the teen aspects emphasise how young Marie Antoinette was. Often, with major historical figures, we forget, or just don't know. Henry the 8th's various wives. Queen Elizabeth the first. Even the Dambusters. They were all very young. I find the sign of a good film is that I want to know more. Recently I watched a DVD of Charlie Wilson's War, and immediately afterwards got on to Wikipedia. It was the same here. I wanted to know more. A thoroughly enjoyable film. The acting is excellent and believable. Rip Torn asking about Marie Antoinette's 'bosom'. I could almost imagine the Duke of Edinburgh asking about Diana's tits.",8,0,2,19 August 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," Not as good as it should have been
","This is a lavish production, flawed in two ways; 1. Gratuitous and irritating framing of far too many shots, through doorways, curtains, pillars, horse's tethers, etc. I could go on, but you get the idea, and 2. inadequate performances in some of the leading roles. Natalie Portman as Anne is great, as is David Morrisey as her uncle, and Kristin Scott-Thomas as her mother. However, Scarlett Johansen is far too weak, as is Eric Bana as Henry; I kept thinking of Robert Shaw in 'A Man for All Seasons'. Winona Ryder probably would have made a better Mary. George Boleyn ended up too much like Del-boy's brother Rodney. However, I did enjoy it, although the TV version was as good. In addition, it paled in comparison with Elizabeth, Elizabeth: The GoldenAge, and Elizabeth I. One other thing; Scarlett's performance does not bode well for Mary, Queen of Scots. She's pretty enough, but does not have the stature that both this Mary and MQoS requires.",3,1,2,6 May 2008
Insomnia," A great advert or Alaskan scenery, but a poor 'whodunnit'
","I have enjoyed the Christopher Nolan films that I have watched, but this was a disappointment. The rugged Alaskan scenery is beautiful, and made me want to visit, but, as a crime film, it was a non-starter. The cast is good, but wasted; Al Pacino in both senses of the word, hence the title. Most people going to see a film will know the big name stars who appear in it. When one of them doesn't appear at all in the first half of the film, it's pretty clear what his role in the film is. When he does appear, the obvious is only confirmed, and so there's no 'tension' left to resolve, and no important questions left unanswered, so I, and I suspect many watchers lost, or would lose interest. It's a shame because Pacino, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, plus the 'half-time' star give good, if not great, performances. Maura Tierney's abilities were wasted, IMHO, with far too little screen time.I can't really recommend this film.",2,6,14,31 May 2010
Cloverfield," A Big Disappointment
","Given that this was produced by JJ Abrams, I was expected a high level of production values. However, I found it like a 1950s B-movie. A very poor script, which seemed to be 'Oh My God, Oh My God' ad nauseum, or, at least ad boredom. The acting abilities of the cast were amateurish, at best, and the cast will probably be like a group of characters in an X-Files episode. They'll never be seen again, apart from the pretty younger females who'll probably be seen in a few teen TV programs, or straight-to-video movies, probably with less and less clothes as the films get poorer, with lower and lower budgets. Every expense seemed to have been spared on the special effects to stop viewers getting a good view of the monster. This is a bad thing in a monster movie, JJ. Why 2 stars? I thought that Marlena was very attractive. Otherwise it would have been 1.",2,1,2,12 April 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Makes 007 look like Inspector Morse
","I am a fan of Morse, but the style is like filling in a crossword puzzle - hardly action-packed excitement. However Matt Damon as Jason Bourne makes James Bond - even Daniel Craig - look like Morse - although Jason has the intelligence of Morse, which Bond has never had. This film's action is like the violence in The Passion of the Christ - RELENTLESS - like the Faces album; Never a Dull Moment. I've liked Matt Damon's acting since I watched The Talented Mr Ripley, and he is the ideal Jason Bourne.I just hope there is another sequel with more Julia Stiles, and David Strathairn - the best 'straight' baddie since Alan Rickman's humorous baddies in Die Hard and Robin Hood.",10,1,3,20 March 2008
21," Not as good as the TV documentary
","I watched this film on DVD because I'd seen a TV documentary on the subject, which was far more interesting than this film. The plot was far too melodramatic, and the romantic sub-plot completely redundant. I'd be interested to know more about the subject and find out which bits were true, and which complete fiction. I'll need to read more, but won't be watching the film again. Oh, and by the way, the relevance of 'counting' wasn't explained. How do they use the number to make their bets? I've also commented elsewhere about why they had to hide the money on the first flight. It didn't make any sense. I'm sorry, but this film was a real disappointment.",2,4,6,23 October 2008
Van Helsing," Carry on Screaming without the jokes
","I've only seen this film described as a horror/thriller, but, after having watched it, I think that it was a parody/comedy gone horribly wrong. The main problem is the lack of jokes. It is even worse than Carry on Screaming, which did, at least, have the great Fenella Fielding. To see how it should be done just watch 'Young Frankenstein' - the 'help me with the bags' scene is a cinema classic. Even 'Dead and loving it' was better, although Lysette Anthony kept her clothes on, and isn't as beautiful as Kate Beckinsale. For $160 million the producers could have done better, and made a decent horror, thriller or comedy, but failed at everything. In the words of Eurovision; 'null points', but that's not allowed on IMDb.",2,1,3,23 October 2008
The Transporter," A far, far, far too long Panerai watch commercial
","I like Panerai watches, but, apart from the lovely Shu Qi, this film had little more to recommend it than a Panerai watch commercial. If I'd bothered, I would have lost count of the number of times Jason Statham looked at his watch. However, like Ryan O'Neal in the similar film, The Driver, that seemed to be almost the limit to his acting. I half-remember a review of The Driver that said that Ryan O'Neal had a range of emotions from a to b. Jason Statham is the same; he has 'grumpy' and 'looking at his watch'. The film also reminded me why I stopped buying Stanley Clarke's albums twenty five years ago. The soundtrack was clich√©d at its best, and normally far worse. If you want a film with car chases get Ronin, but avoid this like the plague.",1,0,1,30 November 2008
The Descent," A great scary movie - without any humour, for a change
","This is a great scary movie, without any of the post-Scream humour that was fun to start with, but enough is enough, already.Just a couple of points; Anyone who has read the book will be disappointed as it covers only a tiny fraction of the book's contents. The book is well-worth reading.There is an appallingly sexist comment that 'all girls are the same in the dark'. Well, this film is so dark that for much of the time it IS impossible to distinguish between the characters.I won't say it's good clean fun, but it is good, gory scary fun, and a worthy successor to the Hammer films of my youth.",8,1,3,21 June 2008
The Fountain," Agood-looking film that makes you think
","Firstly, I won't attempt to describe the plot, as, frankly, even after reading the Wikipedia article, I didn't fully understand it. However, I'd like to make a few comments:1. It's a very good-looking film, which reminded me of the early films of Ridley Scott - from The Duellists (a personal favourite) through 'Someone to Watch over me'.2. My main problem with the plot (or losing it!!) was what I now understand to be 'the astronaut'. I thought he was Buddha, or a Buddhist priest, and was completely confused. However, the working title of the film - The Last Man - suggests he maybe is the last human, and, like in 'Sunshine', is on a mission to save humanity and, also like in 'Sunshine', sacrifices himself to save The Tree - and humanity. Also, I think I remember him walking on water, after killing the Mayan priest, to reach The Tree. Another Jesus allusion?3. All through the film there is a scene of the researcher refusing to go for a walk in the snow with his (terminally) ill wife. Robert Burns put it far better than I in his poem 'Here's a bottle' with the verse:'Catch the moments as they fly, and use them as ye ought, man; believe me, happiness is shy, and comes not aye when sought, man.'By the end of the film the researcher regrets not going for the walk.4. Hugh Jackman plays the multiple roles - from 'Buddha', to a swash-buckling conquistador, to an obsessive doctor like Jeremy Irons' dual role in 'Dead Ringers' - brilliantly. Rachel Weisz, as the Queen, has never looked more beautiful. I'll definitely watch this film again and, probably, again.",9,2,4,25 January 2008
Inception," Preposterous, utterly preposterous, but................
","Inception is also very inventive, and utterly riveting. The thought of someone else taking control of one's dreams is a frightening prospect, but is brilliantly presented in this film. It gets a bit complicated when the different 'levels' are introduced, but this leads to some Oscar-potential editing. In fact, this film should win several Oscars; best picture, best director, best supporting actor (Ellen Page), as well as the editing one. I can hardly wait to watch the film again. I've been a fan of Christopher Nolan since Memento, but with this film, he was really excelled himself. I just wonder what he'll think of next. One more line for good luck.",10,0,4,13 November 2010
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," And I thought that it was me....
","I bought this film to watch with my 9-year-old twin sons, but my born-again wife banned it as being not 'age appropriate'. I decided to watch it myself anyway as I thought that Sucker Punch was fun with attractive young ladies and good music. Seeing the cast, including Amy Adams, whom I like, plus Wonderwoman, who I always associate with Jaime Murray in Hustle. How wrong I was.Firstly the 'unofficial' DVD (bought in Malaysia) was over three hours long, and that is VERY long. I like long films, with the Director's Cut of Once Upon a Time in America being one of my favourite films.Secondly, and importantly, the film is an impenetrable mess. I suffered a stroke in 2002, and occasionally get confused with things, so I thought that it might be me, but after reading other reviews, there must either be a lot of stroke-victim reviewers or it is a (unintentionally) surreal shambles.Amy Adams was, of course, petite and lovely and even appeared naked in a bath - the tease. Elsewhere she was just a wee damsel-in-distress.Wonderwoman did nothing, and even if she had, the wrong actress was cast. Shannon Elizabeth or Megan Fox would have been better.Sometimes bad films are better the second time, so I may read the plot on Wikipedia and try again, but will be wary of Zack in the future.BTW, I forgot the worst character and actor; Lex Luthor and Jesse Eisenberg, who seemed to be doing an unsuccessful audition for The Joker.Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.Be afraid, be very afraid.",3,2,6,11 February 2017
