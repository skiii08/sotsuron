Blade Runner 2049," A one of a kind Big Budget Art Cinema
","Blade Runner 2049 - Waoww. I have often stated that Roger Deakins is a master Cinematographer and often his Oscars were stolen by other cinematographers. Even after 13 nominations (highest by any Cinematographer in the history) and yet not a single win. This is the time. For the first time hi was working with an enormous budget of 150m$ and for the first time he was creating a futuristic world. And he has hammered the nail perfectly. He should and must win this time. And I am saying this after considering the exceptional cinematography done by Hoyte Van Hoytema in Dunkirk with IMAX camera , because even the word 'Exceptional' falls short what Deakins has done here. Each and every scene will make you 'Awe' towards it..That being said , the movie is not doing well till now at the box office. Its opening numbers were very low and trade experts were saying the only way this movie could be not at loss , if only it will be saved by China , Japan and Korea , where it is still to be released .The reasons for its box office failure in America were 1. U have to see the first part before watching this one. It a compulsory requirement. 2. The plot has been superbly kept secretive , which is great for the audience like me who were interested in the movie even before the trailer came out , but creates distance from the audience who wants to know about the movie before watching it. 3. It's very noncommercial. Too lengthy , very serious , less action scenes , very artful , which makes it vulnerable at box office.But I don't want to talk about the box office , it's making me sad , as m very happy after watching the film , and it would be a very big lose for Hollywood if this film doesn't perform well. Because then no other studio will try to do this thing again. It's one of a kind film , I don't remember any other movie which priorities the AMBITION over its COMMERCIAL Prospect so much and still made with a budget of 150m$ . The movie totally builds on the story-line of the first installment. Answers some questions from that film , raises some new questions , which will be answer in future movies if ever made.But the best thing about the film(apart from Cinematography obviously) is writing. We don't get to see such brilliant writing in such a big budget film (again except Christopher Nolan movies). There were so many genuine surprises that you can't stop praising the writers. The surprises keep on coming. They never stop. And the movie end with giving you the feeling that you want more.Acting wise there is only Ryan Gosline to talk about. He was the only character in the whole movie. All the other actors just come and go. Dave Batista got one scene , Jared Leto got two. Harrison For comes in the last 45min of the movie although utilized very nicely. Ana De Armas gave a very emotional performance . But Ryan get much more emotional and vulnerable , with each shock he gets in the film. It's such nice to see him in a big budget film. It would be so nice if it becomes a franchise. The score from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch is heart pounding sometimes and goes total silence in rest of the part.Denis Villeneuve is a very good director. One of the best working right now. I have liked his Prisoner , Sicario and Enemy , and liked Arrival a little less . People keep comparing him to Nolan . Which I think is wrong. Villeneuve doesn't have the business sense of Nolan. The failure of Blade Runner 2049 at the box office after such awesome reviews proves it. Nolan knows his audience and also knows how much budget he should inject in his film to make it a hit. He just don't goes on spending money without analyzing the commercial prospect of this film. That doesn't mean Nolan is not artistic. Rather you can say he is the artist who sales most . Villeneuve should learn this single talent from Nolan and then he could be as successful as Nolan in the Box Office.Some more action scenes and slight editing here and there could easily had raised its commercial prospect . Also we needed some more scenes of Jared Leto as the Villain.Like I said , m hoping that China , South Korea and Japan will save this film from drowning , and m also expecting this movie to bag almost all the technical awards in this Oscar like Mad Max: Fury Road did.8.5/10 By ANuP APu KuMaR.",9,2,6,10 October 2017
It," Its Good
","IT - Anybody who is expecting a proper horror film without knowing about the source material (which i myself haven't read but have enough research on it) is going to get disappointed. Because its basically a 'Coming Of The Age' film with a very scary clown in it. But let me be very specific. Horror elements were only secondary in the film , Drama is the primary thing . And because i knew this before seeing it , i liked it a lot.Its a different kind of Horror film. Its a R rated film , with pretty much a lot of violence, with kids being in the lead and a Clown who is killing them. Director Andy Muschietti was not into the usual JUMP SCARE thing (Thankfully). There were no false dream sequence , no door shutting scares , no unnecessary loud sound design. Its actually very realistic . I mean as realistic as a horror movie with a scary clown can get. The characters in the movie doesn't do foolish things to get killed. I mean yes there were some foolish step taken by the characters but come on , they were just 13 year old kid, we have to give them that much freedom. You can understand how much i appreciate the things this movies doesn't do , because Horror Movies have become very stereotypical in last two decades , but thankfully Warner Bros has taken a different root. They are trying to be realistic and sensible about it. They were doing the same thing in the Conjuring series , and they did the same here. As much as the movie is about 7 kids tackling with a Clown with crocodile teeth , the movie has so many different themes. Every kid has his own demon in real life to tackle. Somebody is tackling with the trauma of Lost brother , somebody is tackling a father who sexually abuse her , somebody want to get rid of over protective mom , somebody want to tackle his father's high expectation. Someone tackles with racism And lastly the whole group is tackling the Bully seniors. Even after all these problems the kids have a great time hanging out with each other , if only for sometime. The Jokes came in regular intervals . And Andy Muschietti masterfully juggled the serious moments with comic ones , even mixing them and playing at the same time. The cast is exceptional , so much that you will feel bad about them being replaced by senior actors in the sequel . But dame i would be not honest if i don't say it , Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh was my favorite. Yes i know she was the only girl in the club , and it was very typical of me to select her as my favorite. But i cant help it. She was awesome. And also there has been many anticipations for who will be the actors to play these kids in the sequel , i just want two actors for now - JESSICA CHASTAIN as Beverly & CHADWICK BOSEMAN (black panther) as Mike Hanlon.There may be some complaint with the movie not having enough scary sequences. And that's true. Many people had the same problem with Conjuring 2 . For me IT is even less scarier. But that doesn't degrade the film. It just stop it from being a great film. And this reason shouldn't stop you from watching this film. The film has been set in the State of MAINE , USA a state we see very less in Hollywood , and also the state where Stephen King (writer of IT , the BOOK) . And the movies has a very different and fresh look. Its not too dark , cloudy or again stereotypical like usual horror film. Its like any other film set in Summer Holidays. For the END i would like to add , the movie totally earned its R rating in America and its A certificate in India. It had a lot of blood , curse words (the actual way of 13 year old boys talking) , and a little theme of sexual abuse. Hence the movie is not for kids. At least not at all for kids under 13. I am saying this because i had seen a lot of parents came to this movie with extremely small kids and i don't know at all how they are gonna explain those kids that why the clown is eating the hand of a boy.I am obviously looking forward to the sequel. Which i think will answer more questions which were raised in this part and haven't been answered. 8.1/10By ANuP APu KuMaR",8,6,11,16 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Die Hard fans will be entertained.
","ROGUE ONE- A STAR WAR STORY- i must say , there will be some spoilers , because i cant say how i feel about it with explaining somethings. First of all , i am not a big fan of STAR WAR movies(I like STAR TREK more). I think Empire Strike is a masterpiece , considering the time when it has been made. New Hope is very god too. But Return of Jedi is very average film. And the new trilogy was average too. FORCE AWAKEN which came last year was just a remake of NEW HOPE , don't know how it made 2 billion dollars worldwide. But surely ROGUE ONE is better then FORCE AWAKENS , but not on the level of NEW HOPE. The best thing about the film was that it doesn't try to be a STAR WAR film. Surely it is a part of the series but it never pick the FUN TONE of STAR WAR FILMS. In tone it come close to EMPIRE STRIKE BACK , but then again to achieve that greatness was really difficult. liked the tone that the makers have selected and the execution was good too, but their was not much of writing to support that gritty and rusty tone of the movie. Because you select to make movie more serious and not to inject unnecessary jokes you need better writing to support it , and keep it in motion and audience entertainer. But the story-line which the movie shows before the final battle was not that moving. We never connect to the characters , we don't care for their survival , and that's a big problem for a movie which has taken a path being serious. On that note , its doesn't lack jokes totally , there were few , and mostly of them come from a DROID name K 2SO , as dry humor which thankfully never contradict the seriousness of the movie. So what exactly i like about STAR WAR movies - SWORD FIGHT. And there was not a single sword fight in the movie. Because there were no JEDIES in the movie. Other action scenes were very good , but then again not exceptional , no outstanding planning , nor anything out of the box. Among the characters i liked DARTH VEDAR (obviously) most. He is actually one of the best villain of Hollywood , but we didn't get anything much of him . Just two scenes and one very small but great action sequence . This movie directly connects its story to the NEW HOPE , which means i don't think ROGUE ONE will get any sequel , so why not using DARTH VEDAR to his most. It was foolish . Apart from him Orson Krennic the actual villain of this part as DARTH VEDAR'S subordinate was nothing special. He just babbles and shout , he was not menacing or to get fear of. On the right side the BLIND WARRIOR Donnie Yen played was best. He also got one awesome fighting sequence , but again that's it , never used again correctly. About FELICITY JONES , i liked her very much in THEORY OF EVERYTHING , but here her character was not strong enough to inspire the rebellion group, also at first it felt like , she was just interesting in rescuing her father and not in the bigger cause. Nothing to talk about the other characters. The cinematography was very good , and the visuals are of great quality. But i miss the theme music of STAR WAR , the music director Michael Giacchino tried very much to copy the style of JOHN WILLIAMS(composer of all other star war movies) , which felt irritating sometimes , but yes he did a good job with some emotional scenes. This movie has been rewrite and re-shoot which makes you feel like the editing and the flow was smooth. There were many things just left for understanding, like there was one scene when a character uses an octopus to dig out some information from other character , but it was never shown that what information has been found. There was also the case of RIZ AHMED who was actually an imperial pilot , but somehow due to influence of a good character he turn himself into a good person to support the ALLIANCE. But it was never show how that good character influence this imperial pilot so much. My review may show that its not a good movie which is not true. Its a good movie , but that's it. Nothing more. It definitely fills the gap between REVENGE OF SETH and NEW HOPE , and i think that's enough for STAR TREK fans to watch it at big screen , but not for others. But its definitely a good movie to watch at home , and should not be missed by anyone who follows the series. 7.2/10 ANuP APu KuMaR",7,0,2,18 December 2016
Aquaman," Yes It delivers on the promise.
","AQUAMAN - Before starting the review a little box office update. Right now Aquaman is forth highest grossing Superhero movie in China behind just Infinity War , Venom and Age of Ultron. And with this speed it will probably cross Age of Ultron and then Venom to take the 2nd spot , so i think the box office prospects of the movie are going to be good.Now just for the sake of Comparison i think Aquaman is on the par with Batman Begins in Ranking DC movies behind Dark Knight , Dark Knight Rises and Wonder Woman. But just like last year's Thor 3 (being the most fun movie of MCU) this is the most fun movie of DCEU , which is not saying much actually because DCEU is not known for being fun and no the Jokes of this film doesn't go as high as Thor 3 but its still a movie as good as that one (another Comparison).I mean this movie doesn't go dark ever. And honestly m not a big fan of this type of Superhero Movies . Its not like i dislike them , its just something which i don't prefer in comparison to the darker movies likes of Batman Trilogy and Man Of Steel. But in anytime i would prefer a good fun movie then an average Darker Film. And thats what Aquaman provides.Honestly saying the storyline is pretty basic. There is not much in the writing section. Its very much like Fast and Furious films , having a basic plot and jumping from one location to another for one after another actions sequence not providing much when action is not happening. But we still love Fast and Furious films for its action and its gorgeous visual , and I loved Aquaman for the same.The imagination and World building is on some other level (Oscar for Best Visual Effect written all over it). Far far far better then Black Panther (with which it also had some storyline similarities). Watching this movie in 3D (which i did) and if possible in IMAX(which i unfortunately didn't) is the best possible way. Its so grand and gorgeous that it will take another whole review to just discuss about ATLANTIS.The action scenes ? They were HARD , i mean really really HARD. Another comparison to Fast and Furious movies. Every punch in the movie is like a Steel Punch, with Heart Pumping sound effects. U can feel the hurt that the person receiving the punch was feeling.Unfortunately the only technical department which disappointed me was the music. Its good in some parts but weird in some other parts. Never unique , some weird song choices , i mean who needs songs in Superhero movies , there 4-5 of them in this film. Which is shocking because its the same composer who did Wonder Woman , which had exceptionally good music.Them comes Jason Mamoa. Well he is a below average actor, but thats what we got. And he managed really well when tough scenes were not provided to them. He certainly looks the part and damn good in the action scenes. But that's it. And i am not complaining.In comparison Amber Heard acted really well. I always liked her acting but she has always been considered a B Grade average actress with alot of bad movies in her filmography. I hope this will changer that thinking. Nicole Kidman didn't get much to do , but got one really small yet great action scene.So its a step in the right direction for DCEU(a line many reviewers are saying because its true). Lets see what SHAZAM will have in its bag when it will release next year.8.1/10",8,3,6,16 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," This Is Fun . A Really Funny Film. Better then both the GOTG films
","Thor: Ragnarok- THIS IS FUN . A REALLY FUNNY FILM. BETTER THEN BOTH THE GUARDIAN OF THE GALAXY FILMS(yes the first one too) WITHOUT TAKING BACK ANY CREDIT FROM THOSE TWO MOVIES. And thats totally because of Taika Waititi , the director who i think is far superior a director then James Gunn. And there was writing too. Not just senseless fun , like GOTG 2. Nor its kind of immaterial like Ant Man , or Heroes just having fun like in GOTG1. This movie have serious consequences , in the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe same as like Cap America 2&3 which makes it better then GOTG 1 & 2 , Ant Man and even Dr Strange , but because its never serious it falls behind Cap America 2 & 3. But enough of comparisons now.The storyline establish itself without wasting any time. Just some background connection with part 2 , quick introduction of Main villain HELA , and Thor find himself in another planet captured and unwillingly fighting with HULK , who was very happy to fight anybody , without becoming Bruce Banner in last 2 years. In the subplot or you can the other parallel story Hela is trying to capture Asgard , and Thor want to stop her by freeing himself first. The movie is like when you give an imaginative child a big and costly toy with a lot of abilities and he can do whatever he wants with it. The same happens here. Taika Waititi is a very imaginative director with a very very weird deadpan sense of humour(which i loved in his previous films). So when he got full control and a marvelous budget of 185m$ , the result is great. The close i can compare this movie to Pacific Rim , another movie made by an imaginative director taking control over huge budget and playing with it as he likes. Jokes were the most important part of the film. They just keep on coming. And raise the bar so much that you find such scenes slight boring when comedy was not happening. Most of them which were with the character of Hela whose story got a little sidetracked , even after Cate Blanchett providing really good performance making Hela one of the best villain in MCU. As there were whole bunch of jokes in the whole film , its impossible to mention them , but one of my favorite was when HULK beat THOR in the exact manner like he beat Loki in AVENGER 1 and watching this make Loki shout 'SEE THATS HOW IT FEEL'. It was hilarious. I had a feeling before watching the film that this doesn't become an all n all comic film , and the action got sidetracked . But that doesn't happened. The movie is full of action sequences and each and everyone of them was great. When THOR becomes the true God Of Thunder , it will make u jump with happiness. The directer have done everything you would expect , he didn't pulled back anything. Its so nice to see that Taika Waititi can handle action scenes so nicely , as he will probably direct The AKIRA live action film for WB. Also a small mention of DR STRANGE in one scene cameo . Taika Waititi make his powers look so much fun in his 10min role that scott derrickson was not able to do in the whole film. Which again makes me wonder that its more probably a chance that Marvel will give him Thor 4 to direct , but how much fun it would have been if he will direct Dr Strange 2. Because believe me , this movie have much more magic then Dr Strange had. Oo and yes , how can i forget the music. A perfect blend of Retro , 80's Rock and 90's Trance. U are gonna love it. Again better then GOTG 1 . I think i have to say it at last , its not the best but probably the most fun MCU film till date . 8.2/10by ANuP APu KuMaR",8,1,5,4 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Felt more like a Marvel movie then a SONY product.
","SPIDERMAN HOMECOMING -Spiderman is back at home , and that's Marvel. Although it's wrong to say BACK because in movies he has never been at Marvel before.At the start let me rank it among the other Spiderman movies . And it's just my personal ranking. Its third best for me after the best Spiderman 2 (which most of the people think is actually the best one) and Amazing Spiderman 1 (this one people may disagree). So you can say inclusion of Marvel gave mix results bending towards the positive side.But I do think this movie felt more like a Marvel movie then the earlier Spiderman movies by SONY. Mostly because of the two reasons. 1st being the obvious one , inclusion of Iron Man and his Iron Manish Jokes. And the movie is full of them. Even when Iron Man is not their in the screen. And 2nd - casting of Tom Holland (for which credit goes to Kevin - the head of Disney and Russo Bros - the director of Cap America 2 and 3. And it's easy to say for me that Holland is the best Spiderman and fit perfectly with the tone of MCU. He looks exactly like a 15 year old school boy. And has a nice sense of humour.This fact that Spidey is back in school gave the makers a chance to make the movie light hearted , full of jokes , lowering the stakes (I mean the world is not under any danger this time).But then again the movie lacks Seriousness , Tension , Emotions , etc. No shock value. No edge of the seat scenes , no heart warming scenes like what I got in Wonder Woman. What I mean is that I had the usual problem I always have with the Marvel Movies. So that's just about my personal taste.Also to add , about which I am not much sure but Spidey in this movie has been shown as pretty much incapable. Apart from the Climax fight , every time Iron Man has to come to rescue him . This may make hard core Spiderman fans a little disappointed. Just may be. Didn't bothered me. Because I am not that die hard fan.The movie is too much crowded with characters. Not everyone get a meaty role having the running time of 133min. The best example is ZENDEYA , being just another student , having no real purpose , cracking dry jokes. May be she will get a little more important role in the sequel.Being in High School , Peter was very immature . Apart from fighting street thugs he was tackling usual high school problems - bullying , failure to express his love to the senior girl , not having many friends and yes the most usual one BALANCING HIS PERSONAL LIFE WITH Professional , I MEAN SUPERHERO LIFE.One of the great thing about this movie (which I think should be given credit to but I also think most of the audience will not be able to catch the fact ) is that how close the ambition of both the hero and the villain were in the movie. Both has been demoralized by Tony Stark and Both wants to prove something to Tony and to society. Yet both have a different way to do it.Michal Keaton as vulture was good. For a change we got a nice villain in a Marvel movie. Again it's owned by SONY so it just half qualify as Marvel movie. Vulture is good , not great. He had a clear motive. He wants to do business. Trying to earn a standard lively-hood. Still I didn't find him enough menacing.Action scenes were good. Not very unique creatively , but good. The broken ship pulling scene was very familiar to Toby Macquarie's train stopping scene from Spiderman 2 , but didn't reached the height of the tension which Toby's scene had done. No other complains from action. If only the climax scene had been done in the daylight instead of Night , would have been so much better.The first half was very good. Extremely funny. But when the movie jumped to 2nd half the stakes should have been gone higher. Which never happens. Also whatever serious or sad scenes were there director was not able to make them gripping which is a shock because I loved the direction of John Watts in COP CAR.There were some minor visual effects which looked more like Video Game scenes , but mostly visuals were great.3d being always nice in Spiderman movies was good here too.Robert Dn Junior had just the right amount of role neither overshadowing Spidey(if only we ignore the fact that he rescues him all the time) nor dissatisfying his own fans having a small role.I love Marisa Tomei. She is extremely beautiful even at the age of 52 years. She is a perfect Aunt May. Would have been great if we had got some more emotional scenes of her with Peter.Small thing to add. SHOCKER has always been one of my favorite villain from Spiderman Cartoon. And I always wanted him to be shown in movies. And I got it. Yes as a sidekick of vulture , not a very powerful villain but at least get a chance on big screen.7.3/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR",7,0,3,8 July 2017
Suicide Squad," Not much of a Redemption for DC fans
","SUICIDE SQUAD - My plan for today was to watch two back to back movies , but watching SUICIDE SQUAD made me so much exhausted that i canceled my plan for the second film. And by exhausted i didn't mean by tiredness but by frustration. Things are not working for DC universe. Its all started really well with MAN OF STEEL , but DAWN OF JUSTICE disappointed and same goes for suicide squad. David AYER as director didn't faulted but as a writer he did a bad job. He has done some good writing before(FURY , END OF WATCH,U-571,TRAINING DAY) but he has done some bad writing too (2nd part of fast and furious series , yes the worst one and SABOTAGE , one of the worst movies having ARNOLD as hero). SUICIDE SQUAD fall in the 2nd category.SUICIDE SQUAD is a very limited movie as long as we talk about its scope. Let me tell you the story(obviously in brief and only that part which already have been showed in 4 trailers of this movie). A team of bad villains has been organized. A good half an hour has been spent on their introduction using some colorful visuals. Then one of those recruit ENCHANTRESS goes bad and want to destroy the world. So our team land on the city where this villain making some machine (which the movie never explain that what will it do if made completely) to extinct the human race. Then they fight and they win , and the story ends. SHOCKING RIGHT! i know , but that's the truth. There was no plot , its just the intro , then some comic moment and then the mission. O yes i forgot , there were some back stories too to make us connected to the characters , but non of it worked. Think of this, the movie first promoted itself as a group of bad people come together to do something good , then the movie tries to justifies that those people are not actually bad , but just the victim of bad situation, i mean how does this work does anybody think of that. Why cant they create some GREY characters who have conflicted hidden motives , why they have to show villain as good persons. It doesn't make sense. More then half of the movie is the mission they have been appointed for , that could also have been a nice entertaining movie , only if we have got some exceptional action sequences , but the movie lacks that too. Its just gunshot , some punches , some baseball bat shots and yes some fire (which is among the good visuals). A time when MARVEL movies are making us stun with fast martial arts and chasing sequences , DC universe is still stuck with old slow motion style action. I mean at the climax one of our hero throws a bomb towards the villain , and that bomb literally took almost 30 second too reach the villain. The selection of villain was bad too. Non of our heroes have superpower except DIABLO who had the ability to generate fire. And they still gavecompetition to a 6000 years old witch with exceptional superpowers. Imagine VOLDEMORT defeated by gunshot and rocket launchers of BATMAN , it literally felt like that. It was actually a shame for ENCHANTRESS to get defeated by SUICIDE SQUAD. We get two very small scenes of BATMAN. And those two scenes along with JUSTICE LEAGUE trailer make me realize that m actually in that state where i can get rid of the thing that Christian BALe is the best BATMAN , and i actually started liking Ben Afflecks. But same cant be said abound THE JOKER. He was a really small part of this movie. Not even a part of main plot, just as a side villain who comes and go in between the main plot. I didn't like this version of JOKER. Not at least in this small role. The humor word well . But cant say same about all the dialogues. take this as an example - A 6000 years old witch say to one of our Hero when he trying to kill her - YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BALLS TO DO IT. Really? Is that the way a witch must talk. Action scenes although didn't worked well but the visuals are good. But the darkness of the night scenes ruined it too. Bad cinematography. Which was disappointing because i was kind of liking the 3D at first. As i said the humor worked ,so at least the first half didn't bore. But the lack of any exceptional set piece bore you in the 2nd half. I don't even know how this story-line is gonna be connected to the main JUSTICE LEAGUE story-line. After watching this the whole DC universe seems so unplanned to me. WARNER BROS needs to do some serious thinking on it. 6.3/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR",6,0,1,5 August 2016
Justice League," Better then Dawn Of Justice , just because it does less sily things.
","Justice League - Before, i want to talk about something else. Something i didn't liked , a step backward . And although my rating will not affect due to these points , but i don't want these things to happen again. As we know earlier this year Wonder Woman released. And it did something Hollywood hadn't done yet. It made a successful Female superhero film , with empowerment and without objectifying Woman . . I mean it really raised the interest of female fans. But this movie takes a step backward. And the twitter is full of such angry comments. 1. First the dress of Amazonian warriors were really revealing , which were not in wonder woman. Even in the short time you can notice it. 2. There were quite a few number of BUTT shots with Gal Gadot wearing tight pants , and camera took her pic from behind putting her butt in the middle of the screen. Thats bad really bad. 3. A lot of Sexist jokes. a)In one scene Flash fall over Wonder Woman his face right in front of her cleavage. b) Then while aquaman was talking about each and every member one by one , when reach to Wonder Woman at-last he says She is very attractive . What does that mean , he doesn't have another description for her apart from being eye-candy to the team . c) In Another scene where Gal Gadot was going to talk to Cyborg for the first time , Alfred says SEEMS LIKE U GOT A DATE . I mean why does he has to say it. He knows she is going to talk to him for joining the team. 4. And Lois Lane . Don't even talk about her. The movie doesn't even show her as a reporter , she is just a love interest of Superman , saying sentences to superman like U SMELL GOOD. Doesn't these Woman have self respect. These were some really bad things , which could hurt the female audience. And i don't want DCEU to move to this direction . Woman characters must not be objectified for the sake of producing Jokes. Thank God Wonder Woman has been directed by a female director. Only god knows what will happen to the BATGIRL movie which Joss WEADON is directing as well writing. So that being said . i promise i will not rate this movie any lower for above reasons. Because i liked and enjoyed the film , in-spite of those points. This one is better then Dawn Of Justice not because it has a better story , infect the story is pretty simple and there were not much complications like it was in case of Dawn Of Justice , but because this movie is very safe and does few silly things. But the movie was rushed . As WB ordered to cut it to under 2 hrs. That was a wrong decision creatively , but i think WB is pretty much business minded right now thinking of how much Dawn of Justice underperformed(it must have earned a billion which it didn't) and how Blade Runner 2049 get bombed at box office , length of the movie being a major reason.I hope we got to see the extended version when the bluray comes out. Also The whole JOss Weadon light hearted moments , although works sometimes and the audience did laughed a lot , more then me , but the movie could have worked better without them . I really wanted this film to be serious. Its different to get humorous sometimes. Even Nolan use to inject jokes in between Dark Knight trilogy , but those were so less in numbers and so much driven by the plot and characters that they never hurt the tone of the film. Its not the same here. It gets cheeky sometimes. I really don't mind the standalone movies to be light hearted , like it was in case of Wonder Woman , but when it comes to the team movie , it had to be serious , so that stakes could be felt higher. But again , i laughed even i wanted it to be serious. And the action scenes works. Big time. Even the smaller fights. U will enjoys the fights. Some more back stories would have been really nice, the whole team just came together too quick . We didn't get to know the character's personal life , specially about Aquaman. I really hoped more scenes of Amber Heard as Mera(yes i like her , even after her controversial divorce with Johney Depp and her flop carrier) . Hope that extended cut (if ever will come) can add some scenes of her.Or i will have to wait for the Aquaman movie. Talking about Individual characters , Superman was the best thing about this film. And believe me i am a Batman fan . This Superman version of Zack Snyder is very conflicted , a lone survivor in an alien planet. And even being just in less then half of the movie , Superman really elevates the film. They did really interesting things with Superman. One of which is the competing fast moving power of Superman and Flash. 2nd will be cyborg . He is a real value addition . And at the time of him still finding out what he can do , its really interesting to watch him. Danny Elfman must not get to give music in any DCEU movie again. He was very average .

Dangal," This Years Best along with PINK
","DANGAL - its such a good thing that both PINK and DANGAL , two top movies of this year are women centric. Its such an improvement for Bollywood which doesn't make movies on women because such movies doesn't make money , which is a wrong fact , PINK made almost 300% profit. You just need to make a good movie and it will make you money. And by saying women centric m serious, the character of Mahavir Phogat is not the real hero of the movie , rather its his daughter Geeta Phogat who is in the center of the movie. For understanding what MAhavir Phogat has achieved in his life , we must know the fact that Hariyana is one of the worst state in India for girls. A very low sex ratio and a very low Literacy rate for women. And in such scenario what Mahavir Phogat has achieved is tremendous. That said , one thing is clear that we cant expect anything out of the box which we always get from AMIR's movies like 3 idiot , PK and TALAASH , because its a biopic , so they have to show what actually happened , which is not exactly bad things , in fact what this movie shows is an out of the box real life story. First i would like to mention two things which i don't liked. 1st - The way the wrestling coach of NATIONAL SPORTS ACADEMY has been shown as one sided villain also who is kind of incapable to train , was wrong. 2nd - there was an unnecessary twist in the end which seems unconvincing. Apart from these two things , everything else is either good or great in the movie. The movie tackle through different themes. Sometimes it tackles them one by one , and sometimes simultaneously. But the good thing is that it tackles them convincingly. For example when we see Mahavir training his daughters rigorously , there comes a thought that, what kind of dad he is. He just stole the childhood of her daughters to fulfill his own dreams. But after some scenes on the wedding of Mahavir's daughters' friend both the daughters complaining about Mahavir her friend (who is getting married) reply that she hoped that she would had get such father as Mahavir who thinks about their daughters and wants them to achieve something and not like his own father who force her to marry at the age of just 14 to an unknown person. That particular scene convince the audience that what Mahavir is doing is not wrong as compared to the society where they are living. Another theme which movie showed very convincingly was how free a girl feel when she goes out of his family for the first time. Almost 1 hour of the movie contains wrestling matches. And those matches were done extremely well on technical level , and hook you like you were watching a real match. I mean as compared to this the matches show in SULTAN were just nothing. Among the performances ZAIRA WASIM (also the lead actor of Amir's next SECRET SUPERSTAR) playing Young GEETA was delight to watch. The scene where she request her father to not cut her hair and she will do anything he wants was heartbreaking. And she does her fighting scenes very well considering the fact that the director in an interview has mentioned that ZAIRA was actually the weakest among all the four girls before they start their training. But when it comes to fight scenes , FATIMA SANA SHEIK as the older Geeta was best. She fights like a real fighter and her hard work is visible on the screen. On her dramatic acting front she was awesome too. Both the actresses who played young and old Babita were good too , but got less screen time as compared to Geeta's character. Aparshakti Khurana(brother of Ayushman Khurana) as the nephew of Mahavir has an impeccable timing of comedy , and surly will make you laugh many time. But for Amir Khan , what to say , he blends so nicely , that he became MAHAVIR , and the actor Amir is nowhere visible anywhere. He just makes me wonder why cant other actors (yes pointing at SRK and SALLU) stop-showing their persona and blend into characters in their movies . Around the whole movie there were so many whistle blowing happening , that i was not able to here the dialogues many times. But just before climax , the NATIONAL ANTHEM runs in common wealth games after GEETA PHOGAT won her gold medal(i hope that's not a spoiler) and the whole theater stands in respect of NATIONAL ANTHEM you just cant help and get OVERWHELMED. 9.4/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR",9,9,13,23 December 2016
Dunkirk," Just short of a Masterpiece .
","DUNKIRK - Talk about visual treat . Waaow. But I can't start my review before mentioning how much I Love Christopher Nolan . He is the living God of movie-making. Only he can does what he does.Where I put Dunkirk ? - his 7th best , behind - TDK , TDKR , INCEPTION , INTERSTALLER , PRESTIGE and MEMENTO. That's pretty behind as per his standard but it's still the best movie of this year.I was almost hopeless about getting the chance to watch this movie on big screen , but I got it , while I was on holiday , unexpectedly . One of those instances when God listens to your prayer.Nolan had said that he had studied various movies before making Dunkirk. 2 of the major movies were Saving Private Ryne and Unstoppable. Just think about mixing two of such distinct directors - Spielberg and Late Tony Scott , and you could get what Nolan has brought to the table here.Dunkirk is a fast movie , time ticking , nail biting (in a literal sense I was biting my nails) thriller . You can say Nolan has made his own Sub Genre inside the Genre of War movies. That's why you can't call it Nolan's Saving Private Ryne which people were calling it before release. Because it very unique and totally owned by Nolan. It's his own Dunkirk. Its not Inspired. It will inspire future movies.But you must know about the movie and history behind it before watching it or it can confuse you. Don't worry I will make an exception for this film and give you a crash coarse .It's about Dunkirk evacuation on a French Beach during WW2 , the biggest evacuation in the history of War. Almost 400000 soldiers were there in that beach and as per Wikipedia 338226 soldiers were saved . Thats the basic plot of the movie. But Nolan doesn't make movies that simple. He told the story with three prospective.1st - THE MOLE - Telling it from the view point of various Soldiers on the ground (including former One Direction Singer Harry Style , performing very decently) showing a period of 1 Week.2nd - THE SEA - Telling it from the view point of a Civilian MARK RYLANCE sailing to Dunkirk to help the soldiers , showing a period of 1 day.& 3rd - THE AIR - Telling it from the view point of Aircrafts with Tom Hardy trying to save the Soldiers from above , showing a period of 1 hour.All these stories run simultaneously , and get connected at the end. But it seeks concentration. If you will loose the concentration it may make you confuse.It's a very short film (107mins) . And that was the aim of Nolan. He doesn't wanted to make a conventional war film. There was no politics , no backstories , no photos in the pocket of soldiers for emotional connection , no person shown waiting for the soldiers in the home. The movie shows the physical pain they have to tackle while they were within the war.You see different emotions , fear , selfishness , unclear mind , hope , within the soldier. They would do anything to go home.Two important things - Musical score and Cinematography were almost two characters in the movie.The camera moves very swiftly. Specially in THE AIR section , you feel the movie like you are inside the Aircraft. But it's wonderful throughout the film. It's very bleak and grim . Showing hopelessness. No sign of Sunlight. Beautiful and Horrifying at the same time. Once you see beautiful sea water below the boat , after sometime in other scene you see dead bodies floating in the same water. It's worth an Oscar nomination. What makes it more gorgeous is the least use of Visual effects. I can't point out a single scene which didn't seemed realistic. Add the wide angles and clearity of IMAX camera to it. And it's perfect. Although I haven't seen it in Imax Screen.But the real winner here is the musical score . You can't beat Hans Zimmer in Orchestral music. The intensity of the synthesizer mixed with the ticking clock is exceptional. Zimmer always saves his best for Nolan. The score is so complimentary to the film is that sometimes you can't even differentiate between the score and the sound of weapons.Which brings me to Sound effect and Sound mixing department. Which are two guaranteed Oscar wins for this film. The effects were so perfect that the sound of bombs will make your heart jump outside your chest. Will shake your eardrums.The editing is exceptional. On par with Inception. The transition between three time-line is smooth (if only you concentrate enough) and not a single unwanted scene. The movie keeps on moving every time. Never stops . No time for talk. The survival was continuous from the very first second till the very last second of the movie. I am sensing another guaranteed Oscar here.But he faulted in some minor things here . Which doesn't happen frequently . There was a scene in the end when it's not shown clearly how Tom Hardy destroyed enemy's plane , it's just shown that something hit it and we have to assume it's Tom Hardy's plane. Also the whole 1week part was not shown correctly . What I mean that I only sensed two nights , and three days , it didn't show all 7 days which felt a little awkward.This story couldn't have get a better treatment.And yes , you must see it in the best possible screen available to you.8.9/10 ANuP APu KuMaR.",10,3,11,24 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Russo Brothers are better then Joss Wehdon
","CAPTAIN America - CIVIL WAR - The comparison with Batman Vs Superman is inevitable. In my review to B vs S i had written that the reason shown for the fight between Batman and Superman was too silly , and could have been ignored if they could have talked about it. Many viewers on YouTube comments or on other websites have said that , come-on , give them a break , its a comic book movie , don't take it seriously , we need to get the fight of Batman and Superman , doesn't matter whether the reason is strong enough or not. But i say 'NO' , even if it is a comic book movie , we the audience are not fool , and we need strong reason if two of our heroes responsible for our safety are fighting with each other. And in CIVIL WAR , they talk , they counter attack , they try to stop each other , they give their own reasons and when nothing works THEN THEY FIGHT. And hell what a fight it was. Less i talk about the plot more it will be good for you to consume everything from the movie. Basically its about the casualty of people who died when our superheroes goes for big fight. The mass destruction happens , and many people die , and it is somehow the responsibility of the Avengers. Tony Stark , feeling the guilt of his doings in AGE OF ULTRON want to sign the accords of UNITED NATION that from now Avengers will be supervised by UN. We can clearly see why Tony , wants this , its because of his guilt , and he want Avengers to work on a more controlled manner. That's a sufficient reason. On contrary , Steve Rogers don't agree. He say what we do , must be in our hand , we cant be in control of Govt , because govt have agendas , and agendas can change. Here too i can clearly see why Cap America reacted like that , because i have seen how much betrayal he has suffered from the higher authorities in Winter Soldier. Their thinking differs on the moral ground. And nobody is wrong. And you can root for anyone you like (like its currently happening on YouTube , people discussing who is right and who is wrong) . But its not all about UN accords which make these heroes to fight. BUCKY the winter soldier and Cap America's dear friend becomes a very major plot character in the movie which i cannot discuss. This movie have more then enough action sequences to hold you to your seat. And these action sequences are best till date shown in any Super Hero Movies (yes surpassing MAN OF STEEL but not MAD MAX when it comes to non Super Hero Movies). Cant discuss about all the action set pieces , but the Airport fighting scene in BERLIN was brilliantly done. Each and every character gets his big moment , with introduction of Ant-man(injecting some of the best humor of the movie) from other movie and two new characters SPIDERMAN & BLACK PANTHER . Spider man was great , Tom Holland is a nice choice for it. And he is the youngest Spider Man till date on big screen. Which makes him less experienced cracking more jokes then he should , but he cant control it as he was fighting with his role models . But i liked the character of No Nonsense Black Panther more then Spiderman And m also looking forward to his Stand Alone movie more. He was so serious , so royal , not cracking a single joke in whole movie. Its almost like African Batman of Marvel. I would also like to add , that unlike B vs S , the introductory characters are not just there in the movie for promotion of future movies , rather they have more they perfect reason to be here. Talking of characters , Cap America is always my favorite in the Avenger movies. And one of the best thing about his character is that he has a clear vision , that from the birth , that what he need , what he want to do for his country . And although the situations changes he never get confused about it. But , although Cap America is my favorite character , without any doubt its easy to say that ROBERT DWN. JUNIOR is the best actor among the whole cast of avenger. And he has done so much for the Avenger series (and also get many things in return) . Even if you will be on team Cap , there will be moments when you root for Iron Man , and that's shows the acting brilliance of Robert. He is different in Russo brothers hand as compared to in the hands of Joss Wehdon . He is more serious , full of guilt , less humorous , which makes him better. Cant discuss the other characters , otherwise i have to write another review for that. One thing i misses in Civil War was the Political Conspiracy which was shown in Winter Soldier . And also there was no suspense element here. But the action is more then enough to compensate it. 3d was great too. Look for the scene where BUCKY holds a running bike coming towards him , turn it and ride on it. It was awesome. Marvel Cinematic Universe has changed from here , stakes are high now. Will be interesting to watch how HULK and THOR will react to it. 8.5/10. By ANuP APu KuMaR.",9,3,7,6 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," An Improved Sequel To A Very Good Movie
","THE CONJURING 2 - I would like to start my review by stating the fact that , this is not at all a usual horror movie we watch every 2nd month of the year full of cliché , usual scares and where every story seems to be same as other. Rather its a HORROR - DRAMA. I mean the horror part of the movie is as much as important as the drama part is. Its not always about the ghost , sometimes its about the love , trust and friendship of a couple , sometimes its about sticking together with your family in hard times and sometimes its about your faith , to believe more than you see. First of all its a really good improvement on a very good movie THE CONJURING. But i would like to say about a couple of things i don't like - Obviously its about spirits and ghosts , so we cant always find logic in the activities of those spirits and ghosts , i mean who knows whatever ghost do why exactly they do. There is not always a reasoning to it. Still i am not exactly convinced with the objective of the ghost in this movie. Let just leave this point here as to elaborate it i have to discuss the story which i don't want to do. The 2nd thing is that - Why exactly a ghost tell his name to a person if he knows that by the name that human can control him. Again to understand what m trying to say , you have to watch the film . Apart from these two thing there are mostly good things in the movie which i m gonna discuss now. James Wan is currently the best horror movie director working in Hollywood. He is also directing the upcoming AQUAMAN in the DC UNIVERSE. And i was a little bit scared about this fact , but after watching conjuring 2 i am totally convinced that he can make a great superhero movie too. I have seen all of his movies , SAW was nice for the genre , DEAD SILENCE was his worst , DEATH sentence was pretty nice , Insidious was better then just good , CONJURING was very good , INSIDIOUS 2 was better then the first Part and then FURIOUS 7 which i guess the whole world liked. Its great to watch how he developed as a director. And m so glade that he decided to give importance to the drama as much as the horror part. Its a long movie , about 2hrs and 15mins , which is way higher then the usual horror movie of one and a half hour. Because as i said its not about the ghost always. Yes it ask for a little patience , but it gets paid off , at least for a movie lover like me who don't need everything in hurry and can give time and chance to the movie to get you dissolve in it. A question can be were there enough horror scenes. I would say yes there are. A lot of . Yes it depends on the amount of horror you consume within yourself , i mean how much a ghost can make you scare. I personally got one JUMP OF ON YOUR SEAT SCENE as well as my friend. But two girls sitting just next to my seat had seen the whole movie with holding each other out of fear. You can judge a lot from that. Another thing what the movie did different that , it is set up in ENGLAND and not America. Which made it a different experience. Let me warn you , if you are watching this in English pleas watch it in a theater which provides subtitle , otherwise it would be difficult to understand the British Accent.The people of England behave in a very different way as compared to Americans. They have more humor and are gentle in behaving. There is a very good comic scene in the movie where two police officers see the chair moving by itself and came out of the house saying they cant help as this thing is beyond them. That particular scene couldn't have been possible if the movie has been set in America because in America the police officers are much more serious in their behavior. And that scene was not the only light moment in the movie. The movie was full of such scenes.Vera Fermiga and Patrick Wilson as Warren HUSBAND - WIFE are great again. They trust each other and work great as a team. They also care very much for each other as they know what they do is a life threatening task. There was a scene where Patrick Wilson sing a song for the Haunted Family to make the situation light for the time being , and at that moment the way Vera looked at her singing husband , her expression shows that how much lucky she feels herself to find ED as his husband. That particular scene is a proof that JAMES WAN can even direct a romantic film.The British Cast was great too. The Girl who played JANET (the possessed girl) and the boy who played his sweet brother BILLY were the best. Cinematography was really good , and the period setting was great. Also the music director has done a nice job. Its a great horror movie about a ghost , but also a sweet movie about a sweet family and also a soothing movie about a lovely couple who like to help others by using the extraordinary power they have. M very selective when it comes to a horror film. But now Conjuring series is among my favorite ones , along with Ring series , Insidious series , Oculus , Exorcist and It FOLLOWS. 8.2/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR..",9,1,3,10 June 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Best By Marvel
","Avengers: Infinity War- M gonna try to write this with as less as spoilers possible. But there will be some minor ones , so sorry for that. Q. Is it the best MCU film overall?
A. Yes. (not counting BLACK PANTHER , because i haven't seen it yet)
Q. Does it has flaws ?
A. Many. But its not the best MCU film by becoming perfect , rather the good things in the movie were so awesome , that you are totally gonna forget the bad things.
Q. Is it the best written MCU movie ?
A. Certainly not. If we consider just writing CAP AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER takes the crown. 
Q. Does characters die?
A. O YES. Much More in numbers then u r expecting. 
Q. Does they will be left dead ?
A. Certainly not. MCU is no Game Of Thrones. There are million ways a character can reborn. And this time the movie hinted a way itself . 
Q. Does that affect the emotional effect of those deaths ?
A. Not At All . Its exceptional. The movie will punch u in the gut , really really hard , many times but specially in the climax , after the last fight. M pretty sure this movie has the bleakest Climax any Superhero movie ever had. MCU goes beyond DCEU level dark with this movie. To the level of darkness Nolan use to provide in Dark Knight Trilogy. And although i don't think this movie to be as good as Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises , but even those two movies didn't had such a sorrowful climax.As there were few , i would like to start (yes the review starts now , above it , was just the background, sorry if it gets lengthy) with the bad things. 
1. Jokes didn't worked always. I mean the characters throws jokes in between some serious scenes , which didn't felt good. They also throws jokes when someone is on the verge of getting killed. This has been a major problem for me since the beginning of MCU. But yes , majority of the jokes land very nicely. 
 2. There were too many things in the movie happening simultaneously . Which again didn't feel good always. For example i really loved the WAKANDA action scene , but that fight sequence was cut at-least four times to show whats happening on the other storyline. That irritated me a little. 3. Many characters in the movie didn't got enough scenes for themselves , unfortunately most of them were my fav - CAP AMERICA , BLACK PANTHER and the whole WAKANDA team , Black Widow , Winter Soldier . Hawkeye was not even in the movie. HULK , o my my , how can they not use HULK. Everyone loves hulk, but except the opening scenes where HULK fights THANOS for a very small amount of time , the rest of the movie gave us Bruce Banner because apparently he is not able to change himself to HULK anymore. By the way there were no AntMan or Valkyrie either , but didn't missed them at all. 4. Then there was a single scene where a character did a really really really stupid thing even after 4 other characters were asking him not to do that. And by doing that thing , they lost really nice chance to defeat Thanos. And that stupid thing was done by (yes m gonna name him) STAR-LORD.
So whom did i liked most in the movie. Ofcoarse it was THENOS. He is an awesome villain . Infact the 2nd best villain of any Comic Book movies after - Yes Heath Ledger's JOKER. He was strong . He was menacing . But he had very clear thought. Particular goals . Which he thought to be the right thing to do to cleanse the Universe. He is not a villain just for the sake of being villain. He just don't go on killing people . He only kills them if it fulfills his higher purpose. He is emotional too. Also cries on the loss of loved one. Yes Yes Yes , he is able to love. Stakes were really high with him. Our heres were never in control of the situation , they were getting being defeated again and again .Josh Brolin did a damn good job with the motion capture technique , to make THANOS really really expressive. When it comes to heroes. Two of my favorites were THOR (who was as good as he was is Thor:Ragnorak) with his jokes and his new weapon (an AXE) and his lightening power AND DR STRANGE (who was so so so much better here then his stand alone movie) with his EGOISTIC war with equally EGOISTIC Tony Stark and also his awesome Magical Powers. Others get there time to shine too. But i am specially disappointed with DRAX , who although got enough screen time , is not contributing to the team enough , and was there in the movie to just crack jokes. Then comes the action scenes. Loved each and everyone. Weather it was the small fist fight between Hulk and Thanos or the big and crazily crowded fight in Wakanda. So lets end it with some small footnote points. 
1. I watched the movie in 2d , and totally loved it. So i dont know if its worth of the extra money to be spent on 3d.
2. There was an end credit scene in the very end , so wait for it , which establishes a connection with upcoming MCU film , for which i was not much excited but some how that end credit scene gave me excitement. 
3. If in the early half of the movie u feel that its just good not the best , wait for the 2nd half as it gets better , and the end is totally mind boggling .
4. Last but not the least , this movie has the best cliffhanger ever for any movie to set up a next installment, even better then the whole KATAPPA SUSPENSE of BAHUBALI 1 . So yes , now time to wait. Avenger 4 is coming on 3rd May 2019.by ANuP APu KuMaR",9,7,21,27 April 2018
Sultan," Mix bag with Good performances , nice direction and pretty good fight sequences.
","SULTAN - I am a little confused with the fact that whether it is a Biopic or not. Because in earlier stage it has been promoted as a biopic , but now Wikipedia doesn't say that its a biopic. But i can surely assure that the movie doesn't seems like a biopic. WHY ? - because its a Yash Raj Production's film. So the story goes like this (the usual YRF formula) . The movie starts with side story , which somehow connects with our hero. Hero is not much living a happy life . WHY ? - We have a back story for that. In YRF back stories always starts with a lot of happiness. Then add some more happiness to it and then some more. O yes don't forget the songs in between. Its time for a tragedy , remember in current time hero is not happy. After that tragedy hero gets a way for his redemption , to regain his happy life , there starts the hard work and movie gets a happy ending. So that's the basic formula which YRF has , and now mix it with sports , WRESTLING in this case and you know pretty much the whole story of the movie. But you know what storyline was not something which make this movie a good watch. Its the performances , direction and nicely choreographed fighting sequences (obviously in Bollywood standards and a whole lot better then BROTHERS). I sure cant criticize the movie a lot for being full of clichÃ©s , 1 or 2 unwanted songs , some long melodramatic scenes and predictable storyline because it has many good things too. But neither can i praise it all the way . Its a mix bag. One of the worst thing is its running time i.e., 2hr and 48mins. And the predictable story line makes it hard to watch it all the way. Because of this the good things in the movies separates each other with some not so good scenes in between them.Salmaan was good as a Haryanvi wrestler. He was nice in fighting scenes too. But his fighting moves are very few in numbers , and he was repeating them. Its an irony that Randeep Hudda says to him that its important to learn the style of your opponent and not a single opponent tried to learn the style of SULTAN which was so common . I guess non of them have a coach as good as Randeep. Randeep was good too as a stereotype coach , which i wish to watch more but Bollywood movies spent very less time with training sessions , mostly just a single energetic song and here your big belly disappear and you got beautiful abs. Just in 5 mins. Amit Shad underplayed his character quite nicely. But Anushka Sharma holds the character in the whole movie. She was the support , love , heartbreaker as well as inspiration for Sultan. He made Sultan what he was. Also the reason for his uprising after his downfall. The movie looked good , but not as good as Kick or Bajrangi Bhaijaan . Camera movements are nice. Music was not much of an interruption but surely can have shortened the length if edited. 440 volt was totally unnecessary . Jag Ghumiya was special , after watching it i can imagine why ARIJIT SINGH requested so much to Salmaan for not replacing his voice. So Sultan is a nice movie. At least we can say Salmaan is on the right path since KICK(although Prem Ratan was a little mistake but it was forgivable). Its far below then Bajrangi Bhaijan , a little below then Kick which i personally found more entertaining. But definitely better then Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. 7/10 By ANuP APu KuMaR ..",7,11,25,6 July 2016
Logan," Aaaa OK. Its good. And that's it.
","LOGAN - MAY BE , m NOT SURE , but MAY BE , HIGH EXPECTATION is the reason which spoiled the movie for me. Its good , true , but people are comparing it with THE DARK KNIGHT and TERMINATOR . And that's too much to say. Just because its dark , serious and totally ignores MARVEL kind of comedy , doesn't makes it as good as THE DARK KNIGHT. And I will be one of the few persons who will say LOGAN is not GREAT.Let me tell you in this way. If somebody ask me whats the story of THE DARK KNIGHT or DARK KNIGHT RISES or even BATMAN BEGINS , it will take me a long time to tell the story. Because there were some long and complicated stories there. But if someone ask me whats LOGAN's story , i will tell him this - Its about Old LOGAN who doesn't recovers from injuries like before , have pain in his knees , bad eyesight , trying to take care of PROFESSOR X and who gets a task of saving a girl and delivering her to a safe place. And the movie becomes a ROAD MOVIE. And that's it , with reaching that destination , having action and bringing it to an end. The plot is very thin , they try to elevate it with screenplay which i think couldn't have been any better with this plot. Which make me afraid for some future project , because MICHALE GREEN one of the screenwriter of this movie , has already written three big upcoming movies (ALIEN COVENANT , BLADE RUNNER 2049 and MURDER ON THE ORIENTAL EXPRESS).I particularly didn't disliked anything in the movie , but many things are just average. But there were some good even great things too. For a start , two action scenes , one in first 45 mins and 2nd at the climax were pretty great. And done with minimum special effects used just for Gore , Blood and Cuts(like cutting the head from the neck). Totally felt real. Will be a dream come true for Wolverine fans. But then again JUST TWO ACTION SEQUENCES , that too of 15-20 min long , not like more then half n hour never ending action sequences from Avenger. Just two action set pieces didn't quite satisfy me. There must have been at least two more.HUGE JACKMAN in his last performance and LOGAN , a character he has been playing since 17 years , gave his all in the performance. Its not just the makeup but the tiredness in the expression of Jackman's face which actually make him looked OLD. His 'I DON'T CARE , ITS NOT MY PROBLEM' attitude makes us to feel that , he has seen plenty of things in life and now he doesn't care for anybody else . And yes , the aggression in the last action piece was great. Nothing more couldn't have been expected from JACKMAN . Although i would like to add that , even if i like HUGE JACKMAN pretty much as actor(not among my fav though) , the truth is that except playing WOLVERINE , he has done very few good movies , and i don't know what he will do without this character.PATRICK STEWART is always good as PROFESSOR X (although i like the younger professor x more) , he was pretty good as a father figure to LOGAN in this. Also the FATHER-SON relationship(about which the movie also mocks a little) show in the movie was not very deep but little emotional which this kind of movies doesn't show. But again it doesn't go further in it , didn't explores it as much that it makes me cry. X 23 or LAURA the new character is the movie was real BADASS. Not that much of an emoting character , she didn't said any dialogue until the last third act of the movie , which makes her relationship with LOGAN a little emotionless like she is not a HUMAN rather a ROBOT , but when she starts to talk , its compensate a little what the previous two acts fail to do. BUT and this is a BIIIIG 'BUT' , she was just outstanding in action scenes. Much more anger then LOGAN himself. And it would be great to watch her future story with a lot of actions. One great thing about the movie was that it hasn't been made as a SUPERHERO movie rather made as a WESTERN genre film. Same as DARK KNIGHT had been made as CRIME THRILLER. But the problem was that , JAmes MANGOLD (the director , who is actually the director of my fav WESTERN GENRE FILM '3:10 TO YUMA') goes too far with it. He should have made it like a SUPERHERO being in a WESTERN scenario , rather he turn it into a total WESTERN film , having the only difference being the TWP ACTION SEQUENCES and the fact that out Heroes were not riding HORSES rather driving TRUCK. There was a whole section where they stop to eat dinner with some locals who invite them , which turn out to be such a bad decision and was a foolish thing to do from the start. That whole section was too boring.The background score did nothing to elevate the scenes except the climax action piece . I have just seen 2 days ago FANTASTIC BEAST AND WHERE TO FIND THEM , which had some exceptional piece of writing, which reminded me , this kind of writing can also be done in blockbuster film too. So sorry LOGAN fans , but i expect more.. 7.1/10by ANuP APu KuMaR.",8,1,6,3 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Entertainment but with Tried and Tasted method
","AVENGERS: AGE of ULTRON- Expectations were high to the limits and why wouldn't that be , The Avenger(first sequel) was such a entertaining flick. Everybody liked it , and it became the third highest grossing movie of all time only after Avatar and Titanic. So the first question is that is Age of Ultron is better then The Avenger for me the answer is 'NO' . 2nd Question can arise that is Age of Ultron is worth of spending money then my answer will be 'Hell YES'. The thing is that The First Avenger was first of its kind , before it we haven't seen such a grand super hero flick with so many super heroes (except in X Men which doesn't have famous super heroes individually). But the same formula cant be used twice. They should have done something new , but they haven't done that. The same tried and tasted formula has been used which although force you to get glued to your seat for the running time of the movie but will not force enough to remember it for a long time or to try repeat viewing. So the plot is simple - it starts with a fight , some celebration of wining , an experiment get wrong , a new A.I. villain takes birth who thinks the only way to brought piece is to extinct the humans and start it from a beginning. The villain tries to rip apart the avenger team , tension was created , some inspirational speech from Fury(Samuel L Jackson) and also from Hawkeye , the team is now united again and here comes the grand climax fight. What! Does it sounds familiar , of coarse it is , because Marvel overused this formula before. So why the movie is still good enough to watch on big screen spending extra money on 3d. So here's the truth is , very few people are there who expect depth and intelligence in story and screenplay of super hero movies for example like Batman series and Man Of Steel which DC comics is providing(because of which i am predicting that Justice League movies will be better then Avengers) and even X Men first class from Marvels was great. But most of the people just expect Great Action Sequences and chicky comic lines which Age of Ultron provides in a full amount. U will laugh a lot , Action pieces will make you saying WAOWWWW(still i think The Avenger and Man Of steel have better action sequences in their climax). Some interesting stuffs has been added to the movie like three new character - Javrish who is a good A.I. in the avenger's side doesn't get much to do this time but will be very important in the third sequel of Avenger i.e., Infinity of War, Second one is QuickSilver who runs really fast and his twin sister Scarlet witch. Scarlet has the power to born the fear in the mind of the thing any person is most afraid of(makes you remember Harry Potter movies). But the fears shown individually of the heroes are not so interesting. Hawkeye was the most uninteresting character from The Avenger , but gets the important job of reuniting the team in this sequel as showing why a normal human being without any extraordinary power is needed in the team. There was also some awkward romance in the film which will be good to see if i don't mention the characters. Joss Whedon is an entertaining director , but he didn't tried anything new , only tried to use the same old formula to make it a commercial success which it will definitely get. But the question is how long can the Marvel world can use the same formula. ? Is earning money is the sole target to them ? We will see it. 7.3/10 . By ANuP APu KuMaR",8,2,6,24 April 2015
Joker," Its not Great. Buts its surely different.
","JOKER - For me i don't think there will any actor to top what 'Heath Ledger' did with the character of Joker (with a sufficient amount of credit to the Director Christopher Nolan) in THE DARK KNIGHT. That movie is not just my favorite Comic book movie , but my Favorite movie of all time PERIOD. And a major credit for that to happen goes to the portrayal of JOKER in it. Joaquin Phoenix was awesome in this movie. But for me, Joker is a fascinating character to be used in an intelligent way to elevate the material. When a whole movie is made based on him with him being in each and every scene of the film, somehow the character becomes less fascinating to me. But that's just me. It can be different for everyone.Now i didn't loved this movie, as much as i wanted to. I liked it. but somehow it was not completely for me. the movie has been unanimously praised by the Audience (9.1/10 IMDb right now) and YouTube Reviewers. And has been declared below average by the 'Writing Critics' (58% on metacritics). I fall somewhere in between them. For me the movie creates a fascinating world which makes me more interested to what may come next than actually liking what this movie by itself was. Joaquin Phoenix famously turned down the role of Dr. Strange before it went to Benedict Cumberbatch just because Phoenix didn't wanted to be a part of FRANCHISE GAME. But this movie has been made in such a way (so many Batman References) that it screams for a sequel. Which brings me to the point that WARNER BROS has put themselves in a very difficult situation here. The fans are gonna want a sequel to this film , hell even i want a sequel and i didn't even loved it outright. Now this movie was set in 1981, when Bruce Wayne was just a child, which means for him being an inexperienced BATMAN the sequel will have to take place in late 90s , which of course can not be then connected to JUSTICE LEAGUE. We don't have any idea in which time the upcoming Batman Solo movie by Matt Reeves will be based on. But if you ask me, i would say if there will be only one BATMAN in DCEU then i would want him to be in JOKER UNIVERSE than JUSTICE LEAGUE UNIVERSE. Because BATMAN has always been a better hero when he works solo. I know its a long shot, but i sincerely want Matt Reeve's BATMAN to be set in 90s being a sequel to JOKER even if JOKER not being in that film and then we will get the showdown in the THIRD-INSTALLMENT. Yeah i know i am just daydreaming.Now what good things i got from this movie ?
1. Some exceptional acting. Yes even if i think Joaquin Phoenix was not as great as Heath Ledger, he 100% deserves an Oscar Nomination. I wouldn't be sad if he wins either. Robert De Nero was actually great too in his very small but very effective extended cameo.
2.Beautiful Cinematography - Somehow my IMAX Screen filled totally which only happens when someone actually shot the movie with an IMAX camera. but apparently Lawrence Sher the cinematographer has shot the movie in a 1.85:1 ratio, which worked great. This movie didn't needed to look good, but i love when the filmmaker goes out of their way to make their movies gorgeous.
3. The background score (by Hildur Guðnadóttir) although very loud, works great with the unsettling feels of the film.
4. Every-time the movie stops being a character study and try to contribute more to the BATMAN MYTHOLOGY, it brought smile to my face.This movie can be said as the most Distant Comic-Book movie ever made from being an actual Comic-Book movie. Except those contributions to the Batman Mythology there was nothing Comic-Bookish about this film. There was not a single action scene in the film. not a single scene which pumps your heart with taking you to the edge of the seat , getting excited about what is gonna happens next. Not enough comedy either, which is pretty shocking considering the fact that its being directed by the director of HANGOVER TRILOGY. And there is nothing wrong with making a good character study, where we only watch the things happening in one person's life. But it was not for me. At-least not 100%. I mean you can only watch so many times other people behaving badly with the lead character again and again and again until the temperature rises above the upper limit and the lead character fights back which by the way happened at the very last 25-30 mins of the movie, and even at that time the pace of the movie never rises. Then there were those artistic scenes where the character just dances with himself, talks to himself, laughs with himself siting alone in a room, without the story actually getting forward in those moments. Its too much artistic for its own good. Too much of a slow burn for me.What i want is that now the ground work is done. And this movie is going to be a massive hit. And i want the same team of Director, Writer, Cinematographer and Composer to make a sequel based in this same universe but which will be more exciting, which doesn't feel like its not a Comic book movie. I mean Nolan did it best. His Dark Knight Trilogy was very serious, but never gave the feeling that you are not watching a Comic Book movie.Also if you are determined to catch this film on big screen , then try to watch it in IMAX. Its Marvelous to look at.7.3/10by ANuP APu KuMaR",7,4,12,6 October 2019
It Chapter Two," ll time favorite Horror Movie.
","IT CHAPTER : 2 - Damn this movie was so satisfying and fulfilling. i loved it. It gave me a completion which satisfied my inner heart. A satisfaction almost on the level of completion what Harry Potter 8 and Dark Knight Rises gave me (well yes slightly less than those two movies , but you can understand what i am trying to say). Its has now became my most favorite Horror Movie of all time.Chapter 1 was a really awesome movie by itself. And to top that was almost an impossible hurdle. And from most of the reactions and reviews it seems like the audience is not exactly satisfied with the film. I don't understand what they were expecting. For me the last movie in any series must give you the feeling that this was the way it must have ended. Just like Dark Knight Rises was not needed to be like Dark Knight. It had to be something altogether different because it was the concluding movie and it did that particular thing brilliantly. That same thing is now done by IT CHAPTER : 2 , at least for me.OK first and foremost i am gonna address the things which has been criticized most about the movie by the reviewers.1] Was it a movie too long than it actually should have been ? No. Not at all . I was never bored. Yes there were 1 or 2 scenes which could have been edited. But that would have shortened the movie by may be only 5 mins. Which would have been totally meaningless. In-fact i was so much involved in the atmosphere of the movie that i could have happily seen 15 more mins of this movie.2] Was the D-Aging of Child Artists for flashback scenes too distracting ? Hell No. I wouldn't even has recognized those effects if i haven't read about the same thing in the reviews before watching the film.3] Was the ending too bad? No No No. I don,t understand why the ending of this movie (which is also the ending of the book) has been disliked by so many people. Its good. Simple yet effective.4] Lastly did the flashback scenes were unnecessary for the film? Are you kidding me. Those were some of the greatest scenes of the movie. So great that if those scenes would have been in the first movie instead of this one than the first one could been a better movie by itself. But that would have made this one lesser good.So that's about wrap up all the complaints. Now about what i liked? The VISUAL EFFECTS mixed with PRACTICAL EFFECTS and PRODUCTION DESIGN was the top thing about this movie. Oscar nomination worthy. The 70m$ spent on the movie (doubling the budget of the first one) was clearly visible on the screen. And the money has been spent in a very innovative way. This one is also definitely the most Beautiful (in a horrific , scary and dark way) looking movie of all time.Then obviously comes the Cast. Bill Skarsgård has made Pennywise so much his own as much as Heath ledger had made Joker of his own. There is nothing much to say about him. He was just out of this world in a very crazy way. But the standout performance of this film was Bill Hader. His comic timing, was 200% spot-on. There were so many awkward situation where the writer has given him the jokes that any other actor could have done wrong. But not him. I also loved the fact that neither the director nor James McAvoy & Jessica Chastain tried to use their Stardom too much. They both just mixed-up with the bigger assemble cast and never tried to chew the scenes anymore than needed. Not a single actor has done a job which is below good.The background score was a little underdone than the first part. i would have liked more creepiness. But it was not bad at all. Same goes for the cinematography which goes perfectly with the movie but didn't stand out as the first movie did.The last showdown ? O my my. It was so good. So great. Pretty long (in a very satisfying kind of way where you don't want something to end very quickly). i cant praise enough that particular act. It was heart crunching, in a literal way.And than there was the extended ending. So emotional. Such a tribute to true friendship and nature of scarifies. Very very very fulfilling.O yes, almost forgot (because i never watch Horror movies as just Horror movies), this one definitely had larger number (and better too) of horror scenes than the first one. I judged that by the number of screams i was hearing from the audience.So just watch it8.8/10by ANuP APu KuMaR",9,7,11,6 September 2019
Kong: Skull Island," Extravaganza , Yes , that's the word.
","KONG:SKULL ISLAND - Extravaganza , Yes , that's the word. Man , you got to see this in the best theater available. Thats the best way to watch this one. And its worth of your money. So WARNER BROS is making their own MONSTERVERSE and m glad they are doing it. It started with GODZILLA which i liked an lot. And after KONG it will continue with two films - Godzilla:The king of monsters and Kong vs Godzilla.Anybody who like giant fights like in GODZILLA or PACIFIC RIM will love this. But its different from the way GODZILLA has been made. GERETH EDWARD chose the way of teasing the audience in GODZILLA but Jordan ROBERT has different ideas for this one. No more teasing. KONG has been shown in a full manner as much as possible. No FOOT SHOTS no CAMERA CUTS , KONG is there all over the movie captured with MOTION PICTURE instead of making it totally CGI , which resulted in better motions. Infect there was a scene , where John C Rilley's character just explain the others about the character of KONG , and the movie shows at the time of that description KONG just jumping from here and there doing his daily things not relevant to the storyline. That scene shows the importance of KONg as a character and not as just a CGI monster and also that studio is not holding back and gonna spend all the money the DIRECTOR needs to show the KONG to his full satisfaction. The period is 1973 , after the war of Vietnam. The period details are awesome . The visuals , color pallet and the rock music matches perfectly with the era , making this movie unique in its own way. Cinematographer LARRY FONG (cinematographer of ZACK SNYDER and frequent collaborator of WARNER BROS) use very unique and elaborate camera angles to show the fight scenes as a whole. No frequent cuts , no close up , the camera always backs itself so that we can see the action scene in a complete scale. Speaking of action scenes , its better then GODZILLA , PACIFIC RIM or Even TRANSFORMERS or any other giants fighting each other in any movie for a matter of fact. It will totally 'AWW' you. You would be amazed how great and detailed the visuals are and would definitely regret if you don't watch it in big screen. Here is a big contender for Best Visual Effect in Oscars.The writers have not written a complicated or emotional story. Because its truly a action movie or even called as a WAR film. Men just die frequently. One after another , just like WAR CASUALTIES , and you feel nothing about them , because that's the way wars movies are. JORDAR ROBERTS purposefully didn't gave any character much of a development , because its not about the characters , its about KONG who has given more then enough character development in it. The KONG created here is totally different from PETER JACKSON'S KING KONG. This one doesn't use his hands to walk , has better physic , broader chest , like he goes to gym everyday. Which makes him less of an animal but more of a warrior. He is smart too. he knows whom to kill and whom not to. There is a brief scene where two helicopters tries to shoot him from two sides coming closer, and KONG just jumps upward and both the helicopters shoot each other and collide. When it comes to characters , its John C Rilley who has been the biggest asset. The movie used his comic timing brilliantly without spoiling the WAR scenario. Although i would have liked it if some of his dialogues has not been shown in the trailers. Samuel L Jackson as always plays Samuel L Jackson. A war hero who has just lost a war (although he describe it as abandoning not losing) and now wants to Kill the KONG because it has killed his men. Jackson's character is comparatively good to other characters. TOM HIDDLESTON and BRIE LARSON were just two good looking characters in the movie. Tom has been show as a TRACKER , but the movie never explores his talent of tracking ever.Also it would have been better if he would not have wore a tight tee shirt because he doesn't have a body to show. BRIE LARSON ? well she is a photographer , and she clicks photos. She gets some brief moments with KONG but as i said the movie never goes to the emotional arena(thankfully). But the post credit scene shows that both these actors will be in the next GODZILLA movie , so it would be nice if some meaty part should be given to them.Rest of the characters are not worth mentioning , as i said the movie is not about the human characters. But the KONG will surely entertain you. its pure entertainment. 8.0/10by ANuP APu KuMaR",8,9,16,11 March 2017
Wonder Woman," Woman Of Steel
","WONDER WOMAN - I don't know much about Wonder Woman comics. But i know that Superman comics are based on two themes. HOPE and BELIEVE IN HUMANITY. Patty Jenkins as a director took these two themes from Superman and made a Wonder Woman movie or i can say Woman Of Steel.This is basically a FISH OUT OF THE WATER storyline. The movie shows how Wonder Woman deal with the new world about which she don't know much while trying to stop World War 1. This is by far the simplest story of DCEU. Simpler then MAN OF STEEL and DAWN OF JUSTICE. M not counting Suicide Squad because i don't see much of a story in that film. But being simple is not a bad thing. In fact its great as long as origin stories goes. M glade that Themyscira the birth place of WW is given enough time to explore. Which brings me to the cinematography. From Themyscira(which has been shot in South Wales and looked gorgeous) to England to Berlin , everything looked beautiful in this movie. And the 3d is better then THE MUMMY , although i still recommend to watch it in 2d. Jokes were an integral part of the story. All of them are because of the lack of knowledge of WW about the outer world.And these jokes makes the character of WW a little bit of Naive and whole lot sweeter . Some of the jokes also goes little out of the line as long as preferability of Kids goes,I have to say i am very happy with the action sequences of the movie. True that every movie cant achieve the level of Matrix , Man Of Steel and Mad Max , but WW came pretty close. And i liked all of them. Specially the climax one. Which was too close to the climax of Dawn Of Justice , but Patty here injected some serious emotional moments of WW having the self realization , which made the action scene better. Cant go forward without talking about the scores. The whole movie has been ''VIOLINISED''. I know that not exactly a real word but i still used it. And yes the WW theme , came out 3-4 times . And its awesome. Could have been used even more. Gal Gadot is exceptional. On a level that there has been some Oscar talks running around. She well managed the Boldness and Naiveness of the character nicely. And set a benchmark in action scenes for female super heroes. Chris Pinn , called as box office poison(a star who makes flops despite good acting.) is giving here one of his best performance , and yes the movie is working very well at box office and some credit goes to him. What else to say , m happy as well as relieved to see that the movie is good. I was hoping too much from it and it paid of. 8.8/10by ANuP APu KuMaR",9,68,151,10 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Hell Of A Disappointment
","BATMAN VS SUPERMAN - DAWN OF JUSTICESo Last time i was so much nervous about any movie was the time when DARK KNIGHT RISES was gonna come out , that whether or not it will fulfill the expectations created by THE DARK KNIGHT. And it totally fulfilled my expectations. But m sorry to say this but DAWN OF JUSTICE IS a hell of a disappointment .I find ZACK SNYDER visually brilliant , and the good thing is that he always back up his visual brilliance with great storyline..And that is the exact point where DAWN OF JUSTICE fails. DAWN OF JUSTICE is not a complete movie. Its like a setup film for upcoming JUSTICE LEAGUE films. And WARNER BROS was so busy in promoting the upcoming movies that it faltered in making this movie a good one.When ZACK SNYDER made MAN OF STEEL , many people didn't liked it , because of its dark tone and too much seriousness in it. But i find it great . It was too close to NOLAN'S DARK KNIGhT series , also because NOLAN was the co writer of MAN OF STEEL with David S GOYAR . It both DARK KNIGHT series and MAN OF STEEL , we get to know about the inner life of BATMAN and SUPERMAN . In both the movies they were not the superheroes for the sack of defeating villain (like usually movies in MARVEL universe does). There was intelligence in those movies.. We get to see different prospective to see superheroes. Guess what DAWN OF JUSTICE is not that kind of movie. DAWN OF JUSTICE want to swallow so much things that it doesn't have time for character development , or psychological fighting in brain. Sometimes it feels like people were making decisions without much of thinking , because there is no time.. That shows how much difference just one person can make.. Just because CHRISTOPHER NOLAN was not there in the writing team , the whole plot seems to be fall apart.. NOLAN use to control the whole movie when he is on board , but it seems like DAWN OF JUSTICE was in too much control of the production house.Yes David S GOYAR came back but without NOLAN , and didn't find GOYAR a great writer , but yes he has a great knowledge about Comic Books and can write a pretty good story with a visionary writer (like he did in case of DARK KNIGHT SERIES and MAN OF STEEL) . There are a lot of uncleared things in the movie. Its like even with a long 2hrs and 33mins of running time , they didn't get enough clear everything. In an early scene Superman ended on and unknown place while saving Louis Len and some how it creates and international dispute situation that SUPERMAN is dangerous to human kind. I mean it was not exactly shown that what exactly happened that made humans so angry. You have to understand it by yourself that there must have been some destruction of mankind , but why nit show it. And its just the start , there will be a long list of scenes (i will disclose some of then) where movie will not connect the joints and you have to joint it by your own imagination. At the most waited fight sequence between BATMAN and SUPERMAN , you may feel cheated a little beat. There is not much of reason why SUPERMAN will fight BATMAN . He could have stop the fight by just talking to BATMAN which he did but after the fight. It may be said that its a movie and we have to give some liberty so that action sequence could take place , but i don't agree with that. Instead of giving those liberties i would have liked if more strong reason has been provided for the fight.. Then there is some strong reason from BATMAN'S side to fight SUPERMAN , but i also felt cheated on that section too.. I mean BATMAN is a great intellectual person , he never take decisions in hurry. He is a great detective too. I find it too silly that instead of digging into the matter itself or even talking to SUPERMAN by himself , he just decided to kill SUPERMAN . He has been trapped very easily by Lex Luther to be satisfied that SUPERMAN is bad.Now come to Lex Luther , yes played by Jesse Eisenberg , which at first looked quite decent , cracking jokes , not much different from MARK ZUCKERBERG from SOCIAL NETWORK. But he felt under aged and less experienced. It has been shown that Lex Luther has already been found all the future members of Justice League (yes even before SUPERMAN and BATMAN themselves) but why exactly he is doing so was not mentioned. About WONDER WOMAN she was good with her small role , and her action sequence were good , and also she looked quite gorgeous. But there was nothing that she could have done to made this better. Its like she was just introduced. She was not mainly the part if the plot , rather also setting roots for future installments. Yes BATMAN is the best part of this movie , but i cant compare Ben AFFLEKS , to Christian BALE. This BATMAN is total in hurry , too much carried away with his thought that SUPERMAN is a threat. He never fully analyzed the whole situation and like i said before - didn't do enough digging. But yes thats a writing flaw not acting. I hope WARNER BROS will give more independence to the team , and hire better writers. 6.8/10. By ANuP APu KuMaR..",8,0,2,25 March 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Will engage you till cap America 2 and avenger 2
","Thor - the dark world - We all have loved the movie - Avenger,,,,and m sure all Hollywood movie lovers are waiting for its sequel which will come in 2014....But before that we have go Thor 2 this Nov and we will also get captain America 2 this winter.... Personally in comparison of my favorite hero in the avenger team Thor comes at last,,,,my favorite is cap America then iron man then hulk and then Thor,,,,and i haven't liked the first part of Thor much,,,,yes it was not bad but was not very good also .... But its sequel is really interesting,,,,.... The story starts in the same manner in which iron man 3 has started,,,,after the event of the avenger in new York....Thor is back to Asgard with Loki,,,,of coarse Loki was kept in prison....In the same time in some other part of the world,,,,the king of darkness was planning something bad.... The plot of the movie was not much interesting as compared to captain America or the avenger with some physics here and there etc.....But was good enough to hold u to your seats,,,,Whats actually rise your interest while watching the movie is the screenplay,,,,how a not so interesting plot was shown in an interesting form,,,,that's the strength of marvel comics,,,,they don't give enough strength on the plot as DC comics does,,,,instead of that they make there screenplay interesting,,,,and Thor 2 has a lot of humour jokes which will make u laugh rolling down your seat in the whole movie.... No doubt the action sequence are good too,,,,i haven't seen the movie in 3d but it was good in 2d too.... The best thing in the movie was the character of Loki(remember the villain from the avenger)....This time he was in the right side helping Thor but for his own profit,,,,and i guarantee u this man has a high sense of humour and is the most charming and 2nd most interesting villain (after joker from dark knight) in all time Hollywood movie....The chemistry between Thor and Loki is too good.... Natalia Portman is an Oscar winner actress,,,,she can do a superhero's love lady role with closed eyes,,,,so she was good enough too.... Yes Thor is not up to the mark like the avenger but it will have enough interesting stuff to make u engage till cap America 2 and the avenger 2 will come.... I will go for 3.5 out of 5 ,,,,....

Happy New Year," Decency was the highest expectation for this movie for me and thankfully it was decent ....
","Decency was the highest expectation for this movie for me and thankfully it was decent .... Everybody knows what to expect from movies like happy new year.....and reviews are not much beneficial for such movies because reviewers have to write same old things which already have been written by them.....But for an outer look i can say what yo expect from this.....Its better then Chennai Express and Tees Maar Khan too,,,but below Om Shanti Om and far below MAIN HOON NA (which i liked a lot) ...... Happy New Year is can be said as the comeback of Farha Khan as we all know Tees Maar Khan was the disaster..... The good thing is that there is a plot in the movie....M not saying that the plot was good but the existence of the plot only makes this movie better then Tees Maar Khan and Chennai Express........But Farha Khan has concentrated on too much things...... It cant be said as revenge drama because the villain is never aware of what our hero want to do....Neither its a thief movie because the heist process was not intelligent.....And lastly its not a dance movie because up to the end of the movie our heroes are not good dancer and only god knows how they won the world dance competition that also when the movie is bring directed by a choreographer........ Cant explain all the illogical things because there are too many,,,,but then again i was not expecting logic in this movie.... Half of the movie is filled with the dialogs of old SRK movies ,, don't know for how many more years SRK and SaLMAAN will get tribute in there own movies.......M really tiered of this.... There are emotional melodrama in between the movie along with the emotional back stories and some patriotism also,,,,which doesn't suited the movie at all....If a movie from very start of it want it not to be taken seriously then why bother putting such serious scenes..... Apart from the bad things there are some good moments in the movies which will crack your funny bones....The best one was Abhishek Bachan undressing himself..... Among all the actors its Junior B who stills the show....every single time he was on the screen he will defiantly make u laugh....The only character in the movie who is not wasted.....He has brilliant comic timing..... Nothing i want to say for any other actor because neither of them gives lasting impression along with SRK who just did the same thing what he always does in comedy movies.....Haven't been given much scope...There are many scenes which could have easily been deleted like the action sequence with Korean captain and the Satakli song.....Movies could have been 20-25 min less if editors would have not been sleeping while editing......So beware of its 2hr 58min length....So if u r SRK fan i know u will definitely gonna watch this but this my MSG to all Junior Bachan fans(i know they are very few on number) u should definitely watch this.....M going for 5.9/10......by ANuP APu KuMaR...",6,16,32,24 October 2014
The Martian," Its like a Grand , Epic , Feel good space adventure
","THE MARTIAN - Its like a Grand , Epic , Feel good space adventure. Not in the arena of Apollo 13 or Gravity or Interstellar. Those movies were too intense to be compared with this. By that i means its too quirky. A lot of humour has been injected so that all the time audience feels the entertainment and doesn't get too much confused by the scientific discussion. Seriously MARS haven't been such a safe place before. Its not like the characters in the movie doesn't get hurdles in their way , but i didn't find them fearing those hurdles. Every time any problem wake up too quickly the person facing it dig outs its solution too with a smile in his face. I am not saying that i don't liked the overall humour. Surely i was enjoying that but also those jokes were reducing the intensity of the film. Ridley Scott is not a kind of director who gives back to back hits. It has been 15 years since he directed GLADIATOR which won the Oscars. Last time he made a great movie was in 2006 when he made American gangster , after that BODIES OF LIES was good , ROBIN HOOD was above average , PROMETHEUS was below great (i almost thought he had made a comeback) , but then he made THE COUNSELOR - the worst movie of this carrier , and then comes the Big Budget flop EXODUS . But guess what he has made another comeback with THE MARTIAN. MARTIAN is like anti - interstellar film , which is actually not a bad thing as many persons have not liked Interstellar because of too much scientific talks(probably above their intelligence level - not director's fault) and lack of humour (cant impose jokes everywhere). So here is the solution. A movie with a lot of humour and comparatively less scientific talks also which are not to be taken seriously as there is great performance by Matt Damon to watch. But yes there are parts where i liked Martian a lot . Growing potatoes and producing water in Mars has been my favorite. Although its an anti interstellar film but the cast has been inspired from it. As Mat Damon and Jessica has been part of both the film. MATT DAMON is one actor in Hollywood with whom every director likes to work , and in every big director's filmography there always exist one film with Matt Damon. Here also he spread his charms , totally enter into the character although never we can see him in much of an scary mode. I think he never get scared. Not even if he is alone in a big planet without enough resources. Chiwetel Ejiofor as head of the mission on earth is a great watch with comic lines too. I know its shocking , but in reality every single person in the movie was cracking jokes. Rest of the cast although have big names but i m don't really getting anything to write about them. Visual effect are good , i mean really good but not great. Actually every single thing in the movie is really good but not great. But i guess this will definitely get the nomination of best Visual Effects. For the category of best movie ? I don't think so. For best actor ? No to that too. As actors performing good in movies which are not nominated themselves did not get much of a recognition. As there always is a tighter competition in best actors category then best movie. Take example of Matthew McConaughey from Interstellar who was even better then Matt Damon in this. And whats with those old disco song , they made the movie a light hearted affair. Don't take me wrong. I really enjoyed the film , its just that the Bench Mark for space movies has been set too high. And with Martian Ridley Scott played too safe. Nevertheless its a really good but not great movie to watch. 8.2/10 by ANuP APu KuMaR",8,1,19,5 October 2015
Furious 7," A perfect Farewell for Paul Walker
","Furious 7- This series has never been famous for its intelligent plot ever. Just made for entertainment with cars , action and girls in bikini. But after 4th installment there was a seriousness in the series. They tried to make it better and unique in its own manner and yes they succeeded. Now about Furious 7 , it can be a different movie for each and every person on the fact that what you expect . I am not gonna be emotional to give this one high rating just because it has been made around the tragic event of Paul Walker's death. So lets have a fair judgment , at least whats i think as fair. There can be 3 parameters for judging this movie as what you expect 1.Intellent Plot. 2.High level on action & 3. emotional end to Paul Walker's journey. If you expect number 2 & 3 then this is a movie for you , and you are gonna get overwhelmed by watching this , but for me the 1st point was still the priority where the movie if not failed is just above average . That doesn't mean that i didn't liked the action sequences , i enjoyed them and they are brilliantly choreographed , and so many in numbers that i can't mention them all. But i have some complaints with one on one fights because they were not executed well and to cover that fault our cameraman has shacked it all. As with shacking camera you can hide the faults. For me the best sequence was when one of the female member from team Domnic is transfered from one car to another car both coming from alternative direction. It was really innovative. And yes we also get some high tech hacking kind of stuff too in the movie. Then comes the emotional content. And i am shocked to see such great emotional moments (specially the post climax Farewell message from Diesel to Paul Walker was heart breaking)in the movie which has never been so deep on emotions in its earlier 6 installments . And the biggest credit goes to James Wan the director who is new to this franchise but is a really good director , only one present in Hollywood industry who make more then descent horror movies back to back(for example - Insidious 1&2 and The Conjuring ) . When it comes to acting its all good . The chemistry between all the characters is great as this is the 7th time they are working together. Statham is one of my favourite and watching him as villain is great . Although Dwayne Johnson along with two new entries - Ali Faizal and Tony Jaa are wasted. Nevertheless , its been a really entertaining film . Fast 5 is still my favourite from this series because of the intelligence in the plot and this one comes on the very second spot. 7.7/10.
