The Double Life of Véronique," New narrative -boring narrative
","Most of all I like stories, I might be attracted by more poetic movies but it has to be grabbing me from the first second to the last. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed about that 'non-story', probably of 'new narrative' with no traditional dramatic structure. The result is boring. Moreover, very weak points kill some of the moment: unlikely situations, the clichés: he is a famous writer with 10 books, she receives anonymous letters, a guy in the staircases coming out of the blue, poor actors in the second roles (the two colleagues or friends), a flasher in the street,...and that constant yellow filter on all images...I had to run out of the movie theater for some fresh air.",1,16,39,28 June 2007
