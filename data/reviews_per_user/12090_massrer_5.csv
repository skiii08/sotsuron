Blade Runner 2049," Don't waste your time watching
",It is so slow it will put you to sleep. Things that could be done in one minute here are done in 5 minutes.,2,5,9,10 August 2019
Passengers," Space Titanic
","It is something like the movie titanic but in space. Great visual effects. Not boring. I found two major flaws in the story:
1. When she saved him. Missing part is the logic how is she going to transport him to sickbay
2. Ending.",9,0,2,5 December 2018
Hidden Figures," If it hits near home don't watch it
","As I white man I enjoyed the movie. Nice story. Mean and negative reviews are from those white people that can't handle the facts. They still have the issue with color of someone's skin. So, instead of enjoying the movie they can't take it because of looking for faults. Jealous person can't enjoy someone's happiness. Who cares if she had to walk to toilet half a mile or not, segregation was happening, they brought the issue to our attention. Well done!
I didn't hear those reviewers complain about the injustice to African-Americans as much about defending so call history from inaccuracies.",10,3,7,18 February 2020
The Dark Knight," Rachel
","I just hate new choice for Rachel. Replacement is terrible. She would be better as Jokers sister, at least she has looks for the part.",8,1,2,9 March 2020
Lucy," Terrible movie
","To say boring it would be very good evaluation, but this is beyond stupid and boring. Definitely the worst movie of my life.",1,0,6,17 March 2020
