"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Average, but at least Hugh Grant's not in it....
","I get the feeling that Simon Pegg, after building up such a huge following from Spaced, and Shaun of the Dead/Hot Fuzz, seems to be trying to sell out almost as quickly. Like Ricky Gervais & Hugh Grant, he just keeps appearing everywhere.First two strikes for me were for Big Nothing, a meandering mess of a film with gormless David Schwimmer reprising his 'Oh gee whizz' countenance through a film with too many ridiculous twists. Strike two was for Free Jimmy, an computer animated cartoon featuring a junkie elephant, and utter rubbish...so, strike three for 'Run Fat Boy, Run'? ...No...not really. I kind of liked the film. Simon Pegg seems to be doing the best he can with the material he's presented, (and I guess that goes also for Big Nothing, and Free Jimmy too). OK, the plot came right out of the Brit-com by numbers formula script writing (One downtrodden but lovable guy, one quirky beautiful love interest, one oddball best friend, one slimy rich cad, one cute kid, and one disgraceful old lady with a foul mouth, a lot of the London skyline, and a fair bit of shmaltz) - Well, Run Fat Boy, Run contains all of those to varying degrees, so anyone who loved 'Notting Hill', 'Bridget Jones' or 'Four Weddings' will not be displeased.As for the rest of the cast, I was a bit surprised to find Dylan Moran's character so badly underused. Dylan, a rare gem of a stand-up comedian, does nothing more than deliver his lines in the film, and, as an embarrassing (and pretty weak) running gag, has his bare bottom shown. - Using Dylan Moran for a cheap sight-gag like that is like hiring a cordon bleu chef to microwave a pizza. It's a huge waste! The rest of the supporting cast are credible. Frank Azaria's villain, to be honest, was still, too nice. Likable, even! However, the pacing of the film was all wrong, and the 'nastiness' factor of Azaria's character was ramped up too little too late. The Indian landlord was another staple of the 'britcom by numbers' formula, but he did add a fair degree of humour to the proceedings, instead of just being stuck in there for the hell of it.......and OK, maybe I've painted a bad picture of this movie. It's not bad, there are moments of genuine laughter to be had, amid the shmaltz, pratfalls & lame running gags, but don't expect to leave the cinema clutching your ribs, or with a profound sense of witnessing something amazing. Run, Fat Boy Run won't hasten Pegg's transformation into a 2-dimensional Ricky Gervais wannabe, but it does him no favours. However, it does prove one thing. David Schwimmer's post-Friends humour & star appeal is dwindling...!",6,4,12,14 October 2007
The Village," Hilarious!! (Hang on. What do you mean it wasn't a comedy?)
","I'm sorry, I just don't get the popularity of M Night Shyalaman. The Sixth Sense was a great film, but everything I've seen after that (and with the exception of Lady in the Water, that's everything since)has been either a load of horse puck. I thought that the guy was a one-trick pony, and I think this movie pretty much confirms it.And so to the Village...Well, it started off promisingly enough, with the mysterious sounds from the woods and concerned looks during a Village outdoor dinner, but the film was terrible. Not just the pseudo-olde-English (how did the actors keep a straight face when they were reciting their lines?) to the inexplicable ability of a blind girl to run 100 metres without colliding into a single object whilst in other scenes, she was fumbling about for a step on her own front porch. There were many surprise goofs, gaffes and scenes consisting of pure untainted cheese that was enough to set off the giggles, and once the first unintentionally funny moment crops up, the film just throws up more and more.I guess what made the film so funny was the sincerity and dignity in which it was acted and delivered. Add to that prolonged moments of tedium and then BAM, someone says or does something so unutterably trite, clich√©d, or inexplicably stupid that you just have to burst out laughing. It's like someone from the RSC reciting a soliloquy from Othello and accidentally letting one rip.All said and done, though, I sussed the 'Big denouement' of the film about 1/3rd of the way in, and that's saying something, cos normally, I'm a bit thick when it comes to twists. Maybe it's because it is expected of a Shyalaman film, or maybe, like 'Signs', it's all been done before but presented in a way that gets movie snobs thinking that it's the first time that particular tale has been told.It's a good trick, but nothing more. Shyalaman really needs to remember that a good plot is more than just a twist. If the build-up sucks, then the denouement is really going to lack a punch.",1,26,53,8 August 2006
The Number 23," What a wasted opportunity
","Firstly, let's imagine that the film wasn't called 'The number 23', but was called 'The colour Blue' (or any other colour except Purple). Imagine, if you will, that the main character comes across a book that seems to have an intimate link with his own personal history. Then imagine that the book instills in him a healthy interest in the colour blue. Suddenly, he goes round observing blue objects with unhealthy fascination. He thinks about the colour of his first school uniform, the fact that as a boy, he had to traditionally wear blue, he hears 'Blue Moon' on the radio etc. - are you gripped yet? No. Didn't think so.....But hang on a sec....this is about numbers, particularly, a number that has a very important place in numerology, conspiracy theories, Illuminati history, religion etc. There is already an inherent mysticism about the number 23 that a casual Google search will reveal. Yet the film fails to exploit any of that. It might as well be the number 31, the colour blue, or the letter D.So, now that the relevance & cultural impact of a number with a huge degree of potential to the overall plot has been grossly diminished, what do we have left? Well, we have a very confused plot remaining about a book, a string of highly unhealthy coincidences, a cast of characters who seem too quick (or too gullible) to believe in any old rubbish (For an even worse example of this, watch M.Night Shyamalan's 'Lady in the Water' and despair at a whole apartment block full of imbecilic residents!!), and then, a few disparate glitzy arty 'MTV' shots, just to give the film a bit of street cred. Jim Carrey doesn't lend much to the film, other than his name & star appeal. The film didn't benefit from his acting skills, and he didn't really benefit from the film. It could have been any faceless B-movie actor in that role & it wouldn't have made the film any more or less appealing.The sad thing is, I enjoy a good film with a good 'unreliable narrator' twist in it (6th sense, Usual Suspects etc.), but there are increasingly too many 'bet you can't guess the twist' films that really ruin the genre. (starting with everything Shyamalan has done since the 6th sense, and every copycat film trying to jump a bandwagon!). Unfortunately, the worst thing about the Number 23 isn't the acting, confused plot, or the lack of incorporating the more esoteric aspects of 23 into the plot, but with the 'big denouement'. No, I didn't guess it, but when it finally revealed itself, I was totally underwhelmed. Then, to add insult to injury, the film went on for yet another 20-odd minutes with a very mawkish, tedious and overlong explanation.There! Film review finished (ooh! Spooky! That last line had 23 letters in it! Someone call a doctor!!)",1,3,8,26 July 2007
Mulholland Drive," It couldn't have been more perfect! *May include some spoilers*
","What an amazing achievement! The film just oozes class, atmosphere, sensuality and layers and layers of intrigue. It's one thing to make a film like this, and make it really work, but it's another to salvage a project that was intended to follow in the footsteps of 'Twin Peaks' and create something like this.From an initial viewing with a casual eye, the film looks like it is about Betty, a plucky young actress, who befriends 'Rita', a mysterious woman with amnesia, who seems to have a dark and mysterious background. For a large part of the film, the two women help Betty to achieve success after success in Tinseltown, while Betty helps 'Rita' to try to find out who she really is. During the main storyline, there are several seemingly unconnected scenes elsewhere involving a movie director who sees his wife cheating on him, a strange dwarf in a wheelchair pulling some very major strings, and a scene in which a guy confides a dream to his psychiatrist, then discovers something horrific.Then, just as the audience is lulled by the viewer-friendly and (mostly) generic progress of the film, the whole movie gets tilted on its axis, and it becomes very strange. The actors are all different, with different roles. The cutesy Betty becomes the down-and-out Diane. Rita's helpless damsel-in-distress character changes to a manipulative femme fatale. Major players become minor roles and vice versa. Things get surreal, confused and jumbled, and the movie plays out to a devastating finale, guaranteed to leave most audience members thinking 'What just happened?' Now, here's the genius of David Lynch. He has done exactly the same trick as his other film, 'Lost Highway'. The audience is not watching a film in the conventional sense. For the majority of the film, they are watching a dream, and the final third, are watching a series of guilt-ridden flashbacks and confused recollections, all in the mind's eye of a desperate and deluded woman, who'se jealousy and disillusionment have driven her to commit a desperate act. 'Mulholland Drive' is the nearest one could possibly get to sticking a film reel in someone's mind, recording their thoughts, dreams and memories, then playing the whole thing back on screen. There are clues there in the film, and viewed in the right perspective, the entire film really does make perfect sense. It just takes a shift in perception to see the whole thing, a bit like focusing on a jumble of dots and being able to see a 3D image.'Mulholland Drive' is as much a visual and aural delight as it is an ingenious movie taken from a unique perspective. The film is full of 'Lynchisms' that any fan will instantly recognize and associate with his other films. Satin draped curtains, singers miming Roy Orbison songs, vintage '50's Americana, mysterious dwarfs and an atmosphere that is so thick, it's tangible even in scenes where not much is happening. (Full credit to Angelo Badlamenti) The sets are stylish, and the acting incredibly polished (Naomi Watts deserves particular mention, being able to turn out a character that goes from 'Brady Bunch meets Nancy Drew' right through the spectrum).Even if a viewer walked away from the film without understanding it (and no doubt, there will have been a fair few), they are still treated to some amazing cinema, and some very memorable scenes. Very few people who watch the film will forget the 'Club Silencio' scene, and even people who probably hated the film must admit, albeit grudgingly, that the scene is one that's difficult to shake from memory.Final comments. The film is a challenging film to watch (and all the better for it, in my opinion). It probably has a fairly even division of people who love it and people who hate it, and I can understand there would be some frustration from people who see the film without fully grasping what is going on, but for me, the film is everything I would truly expect from a movie. Something that actually switches my brain on instead of turning it off, and having a very distinct and unique style and flavour that very few directors are ever capable of achieving.",10,1,3,9 August 2006
Paranormal Activity," Not worth the steam off one
","I should have known. I feel so stupid! I should have seen the signs! 1. Loads more ads than usual with the usual soundbites such as 'Scariest Movie of the Year', and 'Completely Disturbing! You won't be able to sleep' 2. Trailer featuring some potentially interesting premise.3. Trailer also featuring a covert cam that recorded the reactions of a cinema audience.4. A curious number of IMDb 'Comments' that praised the film, and actually used the exact same soundbites as the ads! I mean, I must have been really really stupid to have expected a frightening film after all that. I was suckered in, and I am hoping that this review of the movie might in some way prevent someone else from falling for the same mistake that I made.If you're into the whole 'reality/shaky-cam' Blair Witch type of film, you might enjoy this, despite the fact that ever since the Blair Witch Project, you've had several copycat movies that rely on shoestring budgets and internet hype to propel them into the mainstream.Personally, I generally don't enjoy the shaky-cam genre. I give props to Blair Witch for the originality, & the viral method of extending the film onto the internet. Cloverfield was more satisfying movie, and the puzzles & cool hype building the movie up was well-thought. Paranormal Activity on the other hand is nothing more than a load of empty words, and an aggressive ad campaign. Honestly! It is exactly what I felt when I read some of the reviews here, and wondered if I had watched the same film.My main problems were these. The couple in the movie were very bland &unlikeable. There was absolutely nothing of interest about them. It's one thing to want to make a horror movie as real as possible, but at the very least, put some characters with a bit of charisma.The couple act stupidly. - At what point did the male have his common sense gland removed, and decide to stay with this drab woman who seems to be the centre of this haunting, instead of just dumping her and finding someone without any demonic issues? Why do they act either like loons, or completely blase about the phenomena? The demonic source - One of the things that drove me crazy about the whole Blair Witch thing was that people were saying how scary it was because you NEVER GOT TO SEE THE WITCH. - Ermmm...I must be missing something here, because I was under the impression that a horror film needs a good solid protagonist. Ultimately, I felt that this film just didn't have one.The usual jump scares. - If you've never watched a horror film, you'll definitely jump. If you've watched a few horror movies, you'll see them a mile off.The ending - I won't spoil it here, but the 'twist' is really poor. It borrows heavily from another movie I may have mentioned a few times in this review *ahem*, and it doesn't even do that very well at all. There's no psychological head-game, or campfire-tail twist. Just a bit of screaming, a predictable (and terribly handled) denouement that most movie buffs would guess anyway, then a blank screen & the mercy that it was all over.Honestly, I would like to say something redeemable about this film, but I wouldn't even bother to watch it again if it was on TV and I had nothing better to do, let alone pay good money for tickets.Please please PLEASE do not fall into the hype & soundbite/slogan-riddled ad campaign. Don't trust the trailer, which must have found the 100 most timid & sensitive souls in the world, & recorded their reactions to the movie. Don't waste your time & money on this wannabe copycat. At a time of year when there are a crop of excellent movies appearing, don't plump for this pre-Christmas turkey!",1,7,14,16 November 2009
