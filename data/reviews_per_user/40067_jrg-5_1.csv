The Blair Witch Project," Please, make it possible to vote zero !
","Too bad it is not possible to vote ZERO.  I've never been so bored and annoyed by a movie.  I was glad when it was over.  After all the good reviews I had heard, I kept to my seat, expecting that it would suddenly become interesting, but tough luck, after the 80 longest minutes of my life, it was over and I was still waiting to be entertained, moved, scared... or whatever.  The word f*** alone must be 20 % of the dialogue.  Am I getting too old, or is this movie genuinely bad ?",1,49,96,12 January 2000
