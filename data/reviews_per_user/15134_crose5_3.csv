3:10 to Yuma," It's a Western? Yay! But what were they thinking?
","So I was born in 1950 and raised on Roy Rogers on TV when it was okay for a guy to get shot and get up again, or for hundreds of bullets to miss our hero... There are SPOILERS to come!! But since then I've learned to appreciate how John Ford made Monument Valley a character, how every face shot close-up by Sergio Leone of even the most minor character is a work of art. Tombstone gave us authenticity and a twitchy bad guy who almost approached Jack Palance happily sadistic villain in 'Shane'. In the original '3:10 to Yuma',(and in 'Shane' and even 'Airport') Van Heflin was THE everyman, beaten down by fate. 'Lonesome Dove' touches your heart and can bring tears to your eyes again and again. I LOVE Westerns, so I had high hopes for a new one.The new one is adequate, but on the whole, unsatisfactory. It could have been SO MUCH more. It comes close at times but, no, it's not a great Western. I blame mainly the writers, then Mangold, then the cinematographer, and finally the costume designer.As for the actors, I give them an A for effort. Although Crowe can apparently play this character effortlessly, he does an admirable job. Bale has the much more difficult task, he's too pretty, but he won me over and deserves praise indeed. Ben Foster needed a different shirt and he was menacing enough but that was the character not the acting. Don't tell me you didn't know he would leave the guy to burn alive in the stagecoach.And THAT brings us to the real problem with this film. Why was the guy still locked up in the stagecoach? There were 20 or 30 other little stupidities like this. I can suspend disbelief only so much and the writers kept foisting so much absolute idiocy and silliness on us that it overwhelms their skill in helping us understand Wade and Evans motives.The film starts out with a video game battle of a stagecoach chase to capture those with a short attention span who need superviolence and action, meanwhile we're shown that Ben Wade is really an artist, a soul that loves nature, who soon guns down his own henchman for making a mistake. The grizzled well-cast Peter Fonda is gut shot at close range. And they expect me to believe that a few hours later he's riding along like Monty Python's knight...'It was only a scratch!'? Like I said, silliness. More silliness, the good guys have been riding toward Contention while the bad guys are chasing the decoy stagecoach, yet they are close enough to see the stagecoach burning in the distance? They camp in Apache territory at night and light a big fire? William, the older son, was acted well, but his character was a teenager who belonged in the back seat of a 'National Lampoon' vacation station wagon, not the 1880's.While Mangold may succeed in depicting the friendship/hate/admiration relationship between Wade and Evans that's about all I can compliment, and even that was watered down compared to the original. He and his cinematographer jiggled the camera, missed all of the opportunities to show they had learned something about Westerns from Ford and Leone. No use of the landscape, no unique faces in close-ups. Gretchen Mol is a nice Alice but did she look like a careworn wife or more like she had been a week too long between appointments at the hairdresser to get her hair colored properly? And then the ending...an 8-year old could have written a more logical, satisfactory conclusion. Why didn't the marshal and dead-eye Dan just shoot Charlie down in the middle of the street from the hotel window? Why are there women and children out on the streets after the local lawmen had been massacred? How did a 1000 bullets miss Dan and Ben? Why does Wade go part of the way, warning Dan of threats, then suddenly decide he's had enough, and then, when he could have left Dan alive and escaped easily (again!!!!) join him for another jolly jaunt across the rooftops? I am pleased that many people today LIKED a Western, but this is NOT what it should have or could have been. Go ahead and watch it for the story and tension and acting, but if you can't see the holes in this, what are YOU thinking? If this is a movie you liked, then PLEASE go watch 'For a Few Dollars More', and 'Shane' and 'The Searchers' or the complete first 'Lonesome Dove', even 'Tombstone'!!!!! Finally watch the original '3:10' for a much better ending. Then perhaps you will see why I say this could have been so much more, but, sadly, it just is not what it SHOULD have been.",5,0,2,20 January 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Like no other movie ever made - SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL
","There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a 'space' movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.There we sat, waiting for it to begin. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no coming attractions. The theater owner at the Cooper Theatre for some reason chose to play 'The Star-Spangled Banner' with the lights still up so we all stood, never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended. Then the theatre went completely DARK and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible.The overture ended and my seat began to VIBRATE as the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' for the first time in my life. The ride had just begun.(I highly recommend you watch this opening, this film, in a DARK room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that theatre.) Of course, it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, highly under-rated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before.I saw it 7 more times within the next year, always in a real full size theater, like all theaters were before multiplexes. I might have been 'high' once but I didn't go to see it again and again because I was 'tripping'. I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art. It was SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL; the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence; the sights unimagined and unimaginable; the affection for HAL turning to terror. And of, course, WTF was Kubrick really trying to get across to me? Years and years and many more viewings later, I understand it as well, I think, as I ever will. Read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web, you'll find 'explanations', that's not my purpose in writing these comments.What I hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (e.g, Gayne Ballet Suite or the Blue Danube); savor it like you would a wonderful meal, sip it like a fine wine; look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that ARE there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTED to SHARE some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you. a human, came from and where you're headed.If that's too much work for your brain, and you can't see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then, pardon my bluntness, but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith ape. If you want mindless escape, this isn't for you.But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries, and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life.",10,16,34,26 April 2007
Thirteen Days," Kenneth O'Donnell was real, Costner did fine, well done
","I was 12 when this all took place. It's an EXCELLENT retelling of the story, very gripping and edge of your seat.I remember watching Kennedy's speech on TV, then going to a Boy Scout meeting and wondering when the bombs were going to start falling.I am stunned by the number of people adding comments who seem to think Kenny O'Donnell was just a character made up for the movie. Do an online search, people. I am still a registered Democrat. The characterization of Adlai Stevenson was terrific. The UN scene, which was on TV was, in fact, even more dramatic in real life.It would be really nice if we had some Dems around today who actually would have some spine and realize that we are NOT the bad guys. Read JFK's inaugural address, you can find it online, too. Here's a brief quote. 'Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty. This much we pledge -- and more.' That speech is why I am still a Democrat, and I have hopes, however faint, that somehow our leaders today will have the courage to WORK TOGETHER for the benefit of future generations instead of worrying about whose party is ahead in the polls today. We Americans are the good guys and our enemies are much more dangerous than the Soviet Union ever was. Please watch this movie and stop whining about whether Kevin Costner is a good or bad actor, and instead think about the importance of having leaders who care about the survival and success of liberty, at home and around the world. And take the time to consider the long-term consequences of their actions.",Null,3,3,20 January 2007
