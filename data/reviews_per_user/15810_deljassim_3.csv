Ford v Ferrari," Race enthusiasts
","A beautiful movie, especially for racing and speed car enthusiasts, the level of the main actors (Christian and Matt) was very cool, photography, montage, lighting, photography, and clothes were very cool and perfect! The most beautiful thing about the movie is the sensation of excitement and the unpredictability of upcoming events. You will not feel like watching a biography, and I think this is a strength!",9,2,2,18 January 2020
The Irishman," Movie of the year
",I think this is the movie of the year! everything was just perfect! the experience of actors through all years were shown in this 3 hours. It is the only movie since The Godfather that can feel you that it's real Mafia!,9,1,5,18 January 2020
1917," Nice but Simple!
","It's nice movie to watch, however! I think that the story is very simple and the most immersive things in the movie are the editing, lighting, custom, etc. rather than acting level! Actors performance were very normal and nothing was high level! Marriage Story is way better in my opinion",8,0,1,18 January 2020
