Catch Me If You Can," 'People only know what you tell them, Carl'.
","Here we see the true story about Frank William Abagnale Jr. who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars as a pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor escaping from FBI for years. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty has made his prime mission to capture him and bring him to justice, however Frank is always one step ahead of Carl, baiting him to continue the chase.This story began with the fact that Frank's parents divorced and he needed to decide with whom he wants to stay but he chose a completely different way, he decided to escape from home in order to start a new life. And this desicion changed his life. From the very beginning of the film, I did not think about what would happen at the end, whether Frank would be caught or still not. I just hoped that in the end he would be happy. I had so much fun watching this film and smiled almost every minute. There are so many funny and touching scenes in this film. When Carl Hanratty for a long time tried to catch up with Frank, but all the time he stayed a step away from him until he finally reached his goal, but made the right choice did not put such an outstanding master of fraud checks in prison, and decided to cooperate with him in catching other criminals. It was the perfect end of this story.In conclusion I can say that it is my favourite film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks played brilliantly. Excellent camera work and soundtrack. The outstanding biography of Frank Abagnale, which became the basis of the script. This film can be given many more different epithets and they will all be absolutely deserved. Only a great director could make such a great movie with an original development of events. Such an extraordinary life could live only a great criminal.",10,1,2,19 February 2019
