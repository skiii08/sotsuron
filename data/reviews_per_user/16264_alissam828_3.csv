Requiem for a Dream," All I can say is 'amazing'
","I think I may have finally recovered enough to watch this film again. Requiem for a Dream is astounding, beautiful, and painful. I felt so connected to the characters that I didn't know if I would even be able to watch it again; I was so drawn in that I experienced their tragedy. The film far exceeded even the high expectations I had for it before I saw it.",10,0,0,27 September 2001
Insomnia," An intense psychological thriller
","Al Pacino does a lot for this film--on it's own, it would have been okay, but he really makes it good. I wasn't exceptionally impressed by the plot, but the way the tension is built up works very well. Don't go expecting just a bunch of explosions and gunfights because this is more of a psychological thriller, with the main focus on Detective Dormer's (Al Pacino) inner struggle. I appreciated that besides being entertaining, the movie actually has something to say but doesn't beat you over the head with it. The cast is great, there were a few things about the camera work and nit-picky stuff like that that kept me from liking it more, but overall I say this is definitely one to see, especially for fans of Al Pacino.",7,0,0,24 May 2002
Moulin Rouge!," Moulin Rouge is colorful masterpiece
","This film is an incredible experience.  It's vibrant and fun, but it still has a very serious plot.  I was quite impressed.  Moulin Rouge is a great blend of comedy and drama, and the story itself is engaging.  I would recommend this film to everyone.",10,0,1,18 September 2001
