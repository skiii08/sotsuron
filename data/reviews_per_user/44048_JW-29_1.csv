Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Episode I One of the greatest sci-fi films ever
","The Phantom Menace was exceptional. While watching the film one cannot help but being blown away by the special effects which created well... how such I put it... interesting characters such as Jar Jar Binks. It also created realistic scenery like that of the almost too lifelike planet of Naboo or Coruscant. One is immediately attracted to the likes of Queen Amidala, whose devotion to her people was very commendable. It provides a suitable stepping off point for future prequels and I personally cannot wait to see what happens next...",7,0,0,17 July 1999
