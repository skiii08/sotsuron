Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Effects, but can't wait for Episodes II and III
","The effects in this movie were great and a lot has changed since 1977.  I like the effects in this movie because of the car races, the life-like creatures and the whole landscape throughout the movie.   They still have lightsabers and two lightsaber sticks for Darth Maul.  I wonder why how Natalie Portman could survive wearing the Queen Amidala costumes and her hair styles.  Even though this movie has new characters, but It still have Yoda, Obi-Wan Kanobi when he was young and Anakin Skywalker when he was young and before he became Darth Vader.  Great Effects, but can't wait for Episodes II and III.",Null,0,0,3 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut is funniest movie since Howard Stern's Private Parts
","This movie is the funniest movie since Howard Stern's Private Parts because I laugh myself silly.  It's about Cartman, Kyle, Kenny and Stan sneak into an R-rated Terence & Phillip movie.  In Canada that movie would have been Rated AA the same rating as this movie, but anyway.  After they saw the film all four of the kids started swearing and got into big trouble espcially their parents.  This movie is a good laugh and an alternative from seeing Wild Wild West, but don't take your kids though.  Once they pick up, they pick up.  South Park is the real Wild Wild West.",Null,0,0,11 July 1999
Spice World," Where's The Plot?
","I watched this movie and the whole movie did not make any sense at all.  I could not understand it and this movie did not spice up my life.  Why those untalented girls made this movie, because they are only interested in the money (which includes their music) not the talent.  This movie is garbage and their whole music is garbage and try listen to something else.",Null,0,0,23 December 1998
Blade," I liked the film.
","I liked the film because it is a horror flick and an action filck in one. I wanted to see the movie during the summer, but I was 17 when the movie was released and it was rated R (which means you have to be 18 and over.) and I had to wait until I turned 18 and I had to wait awhile.  My Dad doesn't mind if I watched a Rated R movie. I was 18 when I watched it on DVD and it was entertaining. I like when Wesley Snipes kicks the living out of the Vampires 'Butts' and the blood was amazing. I wonder how a baby could survive being alive when the mother was attacked by a vampire while she was pregnant with Blade. That's why he is half human, half Vampire to save the world from Vampires. I like the effects which includes the splattering blood and It was very entertaining.  Wesley Snipes made a good choice when he selected to play Blade.  I liked the film a lot.",Null,0,1,1 March 1999
The Mummy," Great effects with some weak plots.
","I liked the effects in this film, but it seems to me the movie had some weak plots.  Why I said that?  Because it is similar to Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones combined.  I said that I liked the effects because of the bugs, the rising of the sand, the liquid, skeletons moving and how the effects are used in a movie and it should have a better plot.",Null,0,0,10 May 1999
Armageddon," Bruckheimer is better than Cameron.
","I like this movie because it's an energy rush and it could getyour money's worth.  I went to see this movie not just because I wanna get rid of the Titanic craze, but to see a good movie. Bruce Willis has a better acting sense than Leonardo DiCaprio because Bruce knows about being in action flicks and Jerry Bruckheimer made a better movie than James Cameron because Jerry Did not put this movie three hours long and trying to exploit it. I like the effects in this movie and the story about an asteroid the size of Texas destroying the earth and oil drillers drilling the asteroid and nuke the asteroid into smithereens.  Armageddon is my favorite movie since Star Wars.",Null,1,1,21 November 1998
Face_Off," All the stuff you could get in an action film.
","This movie is the coolest.  Why I like this movie so much is because it is intense energy and stunts that is well performed, but Face/Off has the all the stuff you could get in an action film.",Null,2,2,5 October 1998
American History X," Powerful Drama
","This movie is a powerful drama because It's about a man named Derek (Edward Norton) who used to be a neo-nazi skinhead and was in prison for killing two black guys.  While Derek was in prison, he was ashamed and he decides to not live in that hatred lifestyle.  When he does that, he has to save his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from the same path he made.  It was sad at the end though, but I liked the film.",Null,0,0,29 June 1999
American History X," Brutalized drama movie and It's Good.
","I like watching this film.  This film is a brutalized drama movie and it's good.  Why did I say that because this film has a message that hating and killing other people is not a solution in our everyday world.  Even though I was squirmish at the movie 'Casino' that has the similar violence than American Hisory X, but I wasn't squirmish about the violence in this film. The movie gave me information about racism in general and the downside of hate.  Ed Norton plays a good character about a former skinhead turing his life around because he don't want to live that lifestyle anymore and trying to save his brother played by Ed Furlong from making the same mistake that he made. American History X is a compeling drama that stays in your mind forever.",Null,0,0,25 June 1999
Saving Private Ryan," The realistic war movie ever made.
","Saving Private Ryan is the realistic war movie ever made because this movie shows people getting shot in a realistic way, people blown up and the way that is made.  It's about three brothers who died in the invasion of d-day. one brother is alive somewhere in the war and it's up to eight men to bring one man home alive.  This movie is more real than a horror movie, but some good action sequences too.  Saving Private Ryan is much more real than other war, horror, or action films.",Null,0,0,10 November 1999
Event Horizon," I didn't know it was about people going insane?
","Event Horizon has some good action sequences, and the gore is okay to me.  I just got one question, I didn't know it was about people going insane?  I thought it was about space creatures or aliens.  It's really about the ship 'Event Horizon' vanished into deep space.  A rescue team try to salvage the ship and rescue the crew members.  Only one thing, the ship is haunted and goes into people's minds and terrify you.  The rescue team must save their lives before they end up dead.  The story line has some flaws but the action is good, the terror is good, and the gore is good.",Null,0,0,10 November 1999
Titanic," This movie is a pure exploitation about the Titanic.
","I feel sorry about the families who lost their loved ones on that fateful night of April 15, 1912, but this movie is a pure exploitation about the Titanic. Why some people think it's a good film, well at first this movie was good. Then I think this movie is overspent and waste of time because it's a three hours and fourteen minutes of a ship sinking and about two lovers. I did not cry in this movie because of the effects. I got sick of it because of society exploit this movie too much like it's a drug and I spent $6.50 for this garbage and the two studios spent 200 million for this crap, It's insane. This about a rich girl who falls in love with a street punk? It's ridiculous and it's not an extraordinary film, You could recycle it to save the environment.",Null,2,3,21 November 1998
The Matrix," This movie is a rush
","This movie 'The Matrix' is a rush because I've never seen a movie quite like this.  It's about a computer hacker named Thomas Anderson aka Neo (Keanu Reeves) has his life endangered by artificial agents.  With the help of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), they would help Neo to stop these evil agents and help him to find the matrix.  I love the effects involving the kung-fu and violent action effects in this movie and I also love the hard-edge visuals in this movie as well.  These visuals will be copycating other films from other directors, but It won't replace this film and It's the best Keanu Reeves film since Speed.",Null,0,0,26 September 1999
