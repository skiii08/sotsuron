Iron Man 3," Bleh
","I think the other reviewers have covered most of the weak points of the film - the lame villain, the weakness of the iron man suits, etc. I agree with all of those points. The film seems to have devolved into something more along the lines of a Michael Bay Transformers schlock with stereotypical inclusion of a love story, cute kid sidekick and worst of all the flag-waiving jingoism of the Team America nonsense. TBH it's the last point that I found the most irritating. It's also absurd to think that in a reality where aliens have attacked and superheroes are running around, the villain's main goal is to gain some power over the US govt. In such a world the govt seems hardly irrelevant IMO.",5,1,3,11 May 2013
Suicide Squad," Lame plot, boring action
","The plot was very really weak and the action scenes were boring. It was mostly fighting endless hordes of faceless creatures like a low- budget B-movie - think Equilibrium with Christian Bale or Delta Force 2 with Chuck Norris.It also seemed rather pointless to send the suicide squad in with special forces, when the whole point of their existence is to avoid the need to risk the lives of 'good guys'. A far more interesting plot would have involved the SS being sent on a mission that purports to be for the greater good, when in fact it's for some nefarious scheme - perhaps stealing money, destabilizing a govt. or assassinating someone etc. Hell, it would have been interesting to make the movie political and send the SS squad into a war-zone like Ukraine or Yemen.Instead we got a real snoozer here.",4,3,5,8 October 2016
21 Jump Street," advanced screening mini review
","I saw the advanced screening for this yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. The movie positively revels in the various stereotypes that other movies in the genre take far too seriously. The self deprecating humor was truly excellent, and I couldn't believe it but I was laughing during the pretty much the whole movie. 21 Jump St. definitely has a lot of the same elements that made Superbad a joy, and some of the supporting cast - Chris Parnell, Rob Riggle - were absolutely awesome. I give this movie a 9, and expect it to end up in the 7.5 range after it opens. Lots of swearing and a good gross-out scene. Best comedy I've seen in a while.",8,10,29,17 February 2012
Warrior," predictable mushy mess
","I found this movie to be a predictable mushy mess full of clich√©s and obvious attempts by the director to tug at the heart strings of the viewer. Every combination was thrown at the viewer - father vs. son, son vs. son, family financial trouble, marital tension, etc. etc. It was numbing after a while. Oh, I almost forgot about a good dose of American flag waiving with the US military (reminded me a little of Transformers 3's disgusting false patriotism). The fight scenes weren't particularly compelling or interesting, as the final outcome could be seen a mile away. The actors gave good performances, but that's just not enough to save the movie from its awful script. Stay away.",4,10,24,25 December 2011
Sherlock Holmes," disappointed in this movie, could have been so much more
","High production value, but too much emphasis on the fluff and not enough on the substance. Unfortunately Ritchie 'Hollywood-ized' or 'Ritchie- ized' the movie far too much. My main complaints are:1. The fight scenes seemed tacked on, unnecessary, unbelievable, and generally just very un-Holmes-like. They interrupted what otherwise could have been a fascinating movie, and served to break the tension that was otherwise built up between the main characters.2. I felt that the story would have been more compelling if the villain's motives were a bit more pedestrian or character-driven. You know - like seeking revenge upon some big-wig for a crime committed long ago. As it was, the villain became more of a cartoon than a character with depth.",5,1,4,17 January 2010
