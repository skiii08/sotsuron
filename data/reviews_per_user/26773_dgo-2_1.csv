3:10 to Yuma," One of the worst of the year
","Russell Crowe and Christian Bale are fine actors. Here, they do well with the silly dialogue they have been given. But despite the undoubted talent of Russell Crowe, even he seemed to be confused about the nonsensical plot. A shame really,as this was beautifully filmed with solid supporting actors. If you want to see a really GOOD western where the outnumbered good guy fights it out with the bad guys before the afternoon train, you'll still have to go out and rent Bad Day at Black Rock. Spencer Tracey, Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine did it much, much better. Outnumbered good guy, played by Spencer Tracey, is cruelly bullied early on by the bad guys over his physical handicap from previous war (in his case, he does a terrific and believable fight scene despite a paralyzed ARM!) Christian Bale has a terrible limp in Yuma, but he seems to have 'found the cure' before one scene when he goes running along, and jumping between, the roofs! Where do they get the ideas for these modern movies? And why can't they do them as well as they have been done before?",2,4,10,26 September 2007
