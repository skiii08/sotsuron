The Blair Witch Project," Just Awful
","This movie was horrible.  The gall of charging to see it.  Unlike many, I did not consider scary or suspenseful.  The only item of interest was when will this movie finally be over.  It was painful - literally as everyone I was with got a headache from the jerky camera and poor quality images",1,2,4,11 June 2000
