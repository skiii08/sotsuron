Your Name.," an enchanting journey
","FIrst off let me start by saying I'm not familiar with any works of this legendary Ghibli and their works, nor Shinkai Makoto's previous work to compare this to any of that product. I'll simply write this review as someone who has seen the movie and find it enjoyable.As someone who has seen some Japanese animated works, I can say that Kimi no Na Wa is very well done. It is not your usual cartoon, there're so much dynamics in the picture and note that the landscape are very beautifully drawn and it really has very gorgeous scenes from time to time.The voice actors were brilliant, and I strongly suggest you see the sub version rather than the dub (I don't know how the dub will be done but the Japanese voice actors is nothing sort of amazing, especially considering that they have to voice a boyish/normal girl and a girlish/normal boy throughout the movie).The plot is relatively simple, but some twist make it very special. While it's true that this theme of girl and boy swapping bodies is not entirely new, Kimi no Na Wa elaborate it more: showing the anxiety and enjoyment that the two have without abusing it's sexual aspects and in turns build a unique bonds between the main protagonists which make their struggle to find each other more meaningful.The feeling of Japanese culture can be felt throughout the movies, with traditional symbols, such as ceremonies, braided cord, the shrine, forest, and also with dialogues, but it never felt boring as they are very beautifully paced.The music are well composed, and well timed. They bring so much emotions to the scenes. I have never heard anything from RADWIMPS before but they were brilliant on all singles they have on this movie.Anyway, it was a very enjoyable ride, and satisfying experience for me. It's a pity I have never got the chance to see it the 2nd time. If they release a blue ray, I would try to get my hand on it. Also, I'll recommend anyone who watch this search for the novel as well, it describes some of the characters' thought that the movie can't show.It's not really 'perfect'. There are some part of the plot that seems questionable, but for all it is, Kimi no Na Wa is a beautiful and enjoyable emotional ride, it will enchant you through it's 100 minutes duration.",9,2,4,12 January 2017
