Captain Phillips," Not up to par with 'A Hijacking'
","With favourable reviews, buzz from friends, a fine lead actor and director, I may have fallen victim to high expectations for this one, but in many aspects this under-delivered.Firstly, a year before, Tobias Lindholm's 'A Hijacking (2012)' did a much better film on the subject. The Danish drama had better tension, storytelling and all around acting. It also capitalized on the situation back in Denmark, not only on the boat to give it a real multi-layered, multi-prong approached that worked. Secondly, the running time doesn't work for me, as there is a considerable time focused on the US assault team planning to attack the highjakers while the core subjects of the film (the captain, crew and hijakers) lose focus. It is also too Hollywood American gun-ho a la 'Zero Dark Thirty (2012)'. Time and pace was much tighter in 'A Hijaking' at 103 mins or even Greengrass' better film 'United 93 (2006)' at 111 mins vs this longish 134 mins. So the beginning and middle of 'Captain Philipps' were engaging enough, but I could have cut down 15-25 mins easily and even take more time in the epilogue if any thing. Not sure why this movie was nominated for editing or even best adapted screenplay, especially when 'Prisoners (2013)' only got a cinematography nod.Thirdly, I just saw 'Cast Away (2000)' again and Tom Hanks' talent is mostly unutilized here comparing to his skill and range. The only redeeming feature of 'Captain Phillips' that saves it from average is the incredible scene with the nurse when he is in shock. That scene alone is almost worth the hit-and-miss movie, but it doesn't quite save it either.I am not sure why this movie is so well received and regarded, but I dare anyone to compare it to 'A Hijacking' and still find it better.",6,0,1,17 February 2014
Skyfall," Best opening sequence but quickly run out of steam and story
","The 10 minute intro is intense and jaw-dropping and leads to a perfect artistic visual title sequence along the Oscar-winning song from Adele. After leaving Istanbul and Turkey, where the tantalizing ten minutes take place. The first hour is still interesting and have some character development and some great cinematography from Deakins. We meet the new Q in the National Gallery in front of a Turner and the script is still full of humour, we travel to Shanghai and Macau and it is still sexy and suspenseful. We meet the annoying villain played by Javier Bardem and it almost works... yet, when the action comes back to London and later Scotland, it starts to fall apart. The screenplay becomes uninspired and easy and the Skyfall, Scotland buildup and resolution are utterly awful. Barricade, bombs, gunshot and fire in the field yields nothing interesting (save a few nice shots from Deakins) and the Bond backstory is not explored to any usefulness. Javier Bardem cannot do anything with the revengeful plotter who becomes one-dimensional and the sagging story with no plot.I enjoyed every Sam Mendes movie, but here you see the difference in writing quality and consistency. This is no Alan Ball! What could have been the best Bond movie ever (like Bird did with Mission Impossible 4 and Matthew Vaughn did with X-Men:First Class) started with promise, but ended up not quite fulfilling its goal. Hope Mendes will choose better written projects in the future.",6,18,36,18 March 2013
Mulan," Enjoyable, time and time again
","If the Lion King is the best Disney ever-achieved, they came very close 4 years later with this simple tale set in ancient China. With a extended writing team that looks like a football lineup, the animated retelling of this Chinese legend came up both crisp and fluid. The final 88 minutes cut is well-pace and packed with poignant and witty dialog. Add in the a apropos lyrics that are equally funny or soul-searching deep and you have a movie that has almost as much quotables as people in China for your kids (or you) to try to memorize.Then you have the multi-nominated score and songs themselves, including the cornerstone 'Reflection' to give the musical aspect a strong supporting presence. The story is heartfelt and Mulan's character easily memorable. Her story and struggle bring us right into the narrative and the scenes and songs are expertly edited to have the desired emotional impact.The voice talent is noteworthy with Eddie Mucrphy stealing the show as the sharp-tongued mini-Dragon, Moshu. He brings such impact to the his clever and laugh-out-loud funny banter that his presence is pivotal to the movie's overall drama-comedy balance. Ming-Na gives a believable, less-assured take on the woman who tries to pass herself of as a man, but clearly has a big gap to overcome (Mulan; not Ming-Na!) The animation is superb from beautiful scenery, captivating action sequences, to nuanced facial expressions. If you doubt that this is one of the best animated pictures ever released just look at the 10 wins it received at the Annie Awards. I would go even further and say that it clearly simply ranks as one of the best movies and still is after half a dozen viewings since I first saw it in theaters ten years ago.Long Live Mulan!",10,1,1,26 September 2008
Unbreakable," Well woven plot
","The best thing about this movie is the way the story leaves you so many clues and you're still scratching your head and wondering what is going to happen.The atmosphere is very simple and down to earth giving realism.  The camera shots are incredible.  The tension is well played although it is not meant to be strong but rather subtle.Overall, an intriguing movie that makes you think.8/10",8,1,1,5 December 2000
Train to Busan," More than a Zombie Movie and a Good One at That + History of Zombie
","(If you want to skip zombie pseudo-history, please go directly to the fourth paragraph for the film) Train to Busan (2016) is the 'best Zombie movie ever' like a few reviews mentioned, but I am not a particular zombie movie fan. In fact I may have seen a dozen and do not watch The Walking Dead (2010) but do highly recommend 'Men Against Fire' episode of British Black Mirror (2011) sci-fi TV series as a perfect example of social, philosophical, psychological and political warfare examination with a mutant premise, akin to zombie in some aspects. Korean anthology of short films Doomsday Book (2012) had 'A Brave New World' segment that dealt with Seoul zombies in a thoughtful, sensitive way, while Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror (2007) film (segment of Grindhouse) was the best zombie movie before Train to Busan (2016). They surpass classics DAY OF THE DEAD (1985), 28 DAYS LATER (2002) and DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) but I haven't seen George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) or his earlier NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Re-Animator (1985), Dead Alive (1992), Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Zombieland (2009) are supposed to be lots of fun. The Evil Dead (1981) and The Evil Dead II (1987) are excellently cheesy and gory and zombie-like enough to include here.Yet, from all these United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) productions, perfection of the craft within the genre has not been reached. Western origins of Zombies (Haitian voodoo) and Vampires (Eastern Europe) and popularization in the US and Western Europe has not allowed a fresh look at the genre (fresh flesh?). Now Asian cinema is taking things to the next level with its innovation and history with effective horror. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) and Jee-woon Kim's Coming Out (2001) are some example of the best Vampire tales every shown and they are from Iran and Korea.Train to Busan (2016) is a zombie film that is also a great action movie and a drama that holds its own weight. The characters are admittedly mostly one-dimensional but the dramatic action, moments, movements and details make it memorable and palpable. The main relationship is a failed father-daughter relationship that is fleshed out enough to be felt at many crucial moments of the film. Secondary characters are also important and contribute greatly to the narrative and emotions. The couple expecting a baby are the perfect counterpart to our main characters while other (regular or bizarre passengers, train personnel, baseball players) play adequate parts. The suspense is real even if you need some suspension of belief at many moments! This is an action-packed ride and expertly paced. The dilemmas are non-stop and drama keeps unfolding until the final frame. Zombies are scary and cool, the cinematography and special effects play well into the narrative. The tension is well created and the twists and turns keep on coming even if a few or far-fetched or questionable, the majority of the story is strong and holds together. More than anything this is a fun, fast and relentless ride with people we get to care about in an impossible situation after the other. What movies are made for, more or less. In this case: more!No reused Resident Evil (2002) profitable but predictably poor franchise here. I hope to also check out the animated work from the same director including a companion piece zombie movie set in Seoul...",9,9,22,8 May 2017
Passengers," Effective Space Travel and Love Story
","Morten Tyldum is one of the best up and coming director in my opinion and I thoroughly enjoyed his fine Norwegian crime thriller Headhunters (2011) and even more so his multi-Oscar nominated, including for best directing, The Imitation Game (2014) which may have been the best movie of that year. I was looking forward to this science-fiction project, a genre I like when it delivers on its promises, and the trailer even though it looked commercial, seemed promising. Unfortunately, it seems the critics picked the movie apart and I hesitated and doubted before seeing it, but decided that Tyldum was worth a try even with the naysayers. Firstly, Jon Spaihts'script is actually very good and shines on occasion with philosophical/psychological dilemmas and themes without losing the human factor and contact. We empathize with the characters and are afraid, lost, torn, and even in love (yes) with them. The technology, the setting, the context and the beautiful set (real and digital), including a stunning star swimming pool and luxury rooms on this passenger spaceship. One of the character is a writer and the words take on poetic and philosophical turns to trump and triviality or banality of more predictable or run-of-the-mill sci-fi films. Of course there is some plot turns that are a bit far- fetched but all in all it is well within its dangerous and wondrous world it delves into.Secondly, the directing makes the two leads make nuanced performance and illicit the right emotions from viewers while also keeping the oddness, awe, tension and adventurous factor.Lastly, this film is a timeless love story with secrets, sacrifices, choices and serendipity in an attempt to understand and live a potential eventual human migration to the stars and planets with its joys and perils. What do we do with the place and time you leave behind and what do you have to look forward to? To paraphrase the terrific and thoughtful screenplay, we are all just passengers in life... even if we want to be the captain of our lives. What is the meaning of time, life, love, loneliness? This raises great questions and leave you wanting more at the end.This is a great addition to Tylum's body of work and to science- fiction in general. Kudos and hope this will get more recognition in the future... hopefully not in 120 years like this fictional space travel...",9,3,7,5 January 2017
Midnight in Paris," Allen revisits the past
","Owen Wilson incarnates the younger Woody Allen borderline neurotic protagonist and acts with the same intonations of earlier Allen when he was acting. It was so eerie that I kept confusing them or seeing some Allen in Wilson most of the film.The open sequence is a cinematographic homage to Paris that works and gets you right into it. The film is as much a tribute to the city and to all vibrant cities as his earlier Manhanthan was for New York.Then humour, situation and great dialogue and acting starts. The engaged couple interaction between each other and with other couples (friends and parents) is typical great Woody Allen writing. This film is quirky and becomes even quirkier with time, only to work as a whole in the end.Woody's imagination is rampant and his love for previous artist who overshadow the love his protagonist has for his fiancé or vice versa go sometimes into the realm of masturbatory fictional writing and fantasizing, but shine through with the themes, including love, art and the concept of time and of a golden area.My favourite scene which I never tire of seeing is Adrian Brody being brilliant as the genius and eccentric Salvador Dali. He has this satirical version of Dali to perfection (with the quintessential help of Allen as the writer/director) and I could only have asked to see more of him than the brief scene in which he appears and appeal.Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates and especially Marion Coillard also shine as actresses.Thanks again Woody! A moody and worthwhile revelation and mockery.",7,0,0,9 March 2012
Once," Memories & Dreams -- Memorable Movie Night Part 2: The Musical
","This simple film won audience awards at both Sundance and Dublin Film Festival where the action of the film takes place. Action is a big word--besides a hilarious chase at the beginning of the movie, there is not much action--, yet this movie is sure to captivate engaged audience everywhere. The music is dominant and I did not adore or hate it. I found it good and to shine on occasion. The story is pretty straightforward, but this movie is all about the details, about finding beauty and truth in the ordinary. A bit like Americain Beauty (1999), but much more subtle, never overt.John Carney writes and directs, and finds pleasure in the realism and flaws of his characters and story. A story that looks at the past and future with equal restrained, yet nostalgic gaze. A musical mixture of past memories, fantasies and desire for new memories. An acceptance of the world, an assured happiness in relatively uncomfortable social conditions. A human bond. A share experience.The music has nothing earth-shattering, but the directing & editing do. The camera-work is shaky and disturbing at parts, but the whole approach to filming is welcomed and has some novelties in film. A song where the girl sings at night in the street brought me right there with her and her music. The clever montage of the guy's past lover was the best I've seen in any film yet. You did not feel you were watching some flashback-type plot device, but actually getting a glimpse at an intimate couple's life.Above all, this film remains simple, but when I say simple, I also mean true to its vision, true to its characters & story, and true to the essential. This movie's main takeaway in my opinion is to remind ourselves of what is really essential in our lives. It encourages us to appreciate and cherish. Well John, I appreciate. Thank you.",8,3,5,10 July 2007
Lost in Translation," Sofia , Scarlett & Bill
","Sofia Coppola's drama exhumes simplicity and realism.  Good dialogue prevails although the story lacks a little excitement at times.A humorous tone here and there.  Normal lives and their pitfalls captures with sly directing.  Some nice interior camerawork of the actors in their hotel rooms and lively exterior shots of the beautiful Tokyo cityscape. Reflections, doubt, aspirations.Very subtle and effective.  Nothing forced.  A heartfelt denouement.Brilliant performances by magnetic Scarlett Johansson and quirky Bill Murray.  May well get some nominations in that department.  Scarlett is no longer that inexperienced teenager in 'The Horse Whisperer', or even the more intelligent and life-affirming version in 'Ghost World'; her acting is sweet, subdued, but undoubtedly skilled and powerful.To experience with patience and a readiness to experience refreshing down-to-earth moments.christiandominique_ca@yahoo.ca",8,0,0,14 October 2003
Interstellar," Nolan gets past his commercial boyish Batman phase to revert to his brilliant ways
","Nolan gets it right again with an intelligent thoughtful, complex and profound sci-fi ode and odyssey.A robot more humorous than Hal and the hallmark of a Contact-esque quest for humanity outside of Earth. We have a multi-layered personal and planetary drama with all the dazzle, science, sociology and humanity needed to make it legendary.Not without it's flaws in tempo and in a few underwhelming scenes, it has enough gusto, philosophy, questions, twists, tension and tenderness to awaken all kind of feeling to most moviegoers and more.I had the chance to see it in IMAX at the release date and the visuals, sound and handsome music from Hans Zimmer carried the multi-sense tense experience throughout.The directing and editing made the running time seem instantaneous. Interstellar reveals quite a few interesting repercussions of our current scientific understanding of time and makes it relatable and perplexing. The story from the Nolan brothers have several narrative propellers and interesting intellectual revelations like Memento and Inception which Christopher wrote. It does however capture a better emotional, epic and grandiose dimension.Matthew McConaughey plays the lead role fresh from his Oscar win and I could not believe it had been 17 years since I was enthralled by him in theatre with the even better Contact (1997) which I even saw twice on the big screen and many times at home. It has been this long since Hollywood made such a good science-fiction self-contained movie... (it had been 29 years before that with the landmark 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968))Hope I won't have to use the laws of relativity to see another one sooner...An overall satisfied, sensitive and surreal piece of cinematic history.",9,1,5,8 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lesser version of Empire Strikes Back
","Went to see the premier at midnight, and I must say the general excitement was much less than that of episode I.Myself, I did not really know what to expect. I purposely did not see any interviews and only saw the original 'forbidden love' trailer, so I had really no clue of what was to come. I was in for a bittersweet surprise.What I had hoped was for something stronger and more refined than Episode I (although I doubt that it would achieve the craft of the first three originals). It turned out to be of similar value than The Phantom Menace, but a very different film altogether. Much Darker, much slower-paced and with an anticlimactic intrigue.The beginning of the movie was stunning. After some questionable special effects in an early explosion, there is a relatively long flying car chase that looks so fresh and feels so good watching it that I thought I was in for a treat. Light witty humor (much better than slapstick Jar-Jar comedy). McGregor does a good job as Kenobi.Then the middle of the movie explains a lot of the details of the storyline, but does not overly captive besides maybe Obi-Wan's shocking quest and cool looking aliens.The ending collapses with the exception of one or two short scenes, and although we leave wanting more (Episode III), you wonder why Attack of the Clones didn't completely deliver.The love thing worked out OK. The relationship with Obi-Wan and Anikin was good. Yoda and Mace-Windu did their part, and the early special effects were top-notch. However, the fight scenes were clearly a repeat of what we've seen before and the special effects 50% of the time looked plain fake.Back to the drawing board.All and all a good movie, worth your 10$ but can we all say together'Unused potential' ...Now for more in depth analysis****WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS****The main problem with this movie is lack of originality. Droid/ Jedi fighting was seen in Episode I. Rescue someone: Episode IV. Someone getting his hand cut off: Episode V. In fact, the whole movie seemed to aspire to be Empire Strike Back. A dark mood. An unresolved ending...Originality. OK, Yoda fights with a lightsaber like no-one, but you have to have more than that. The fight between Obi-Wan and Jango was weak... Ani and Padme falling in a droid construction chain was plain stupid. Mace-Windu's fighting was NOT too impressive. His Jedi composure out of the consul not too good either. Daku against Obi and Ani, not good... Fighting the animals was perhaps the second best fight!!Take the car chase, enjoy it. The rest is rather uninvolving when it comes to action.Threepio a battle droid... cool, but you have to make the droids helpful; more than saving Padme from 'hot lava'... cheeseEnough complaints for today, there is still a lot of good stuff in the film. What exactly? The first half mainly. Yoda, definitely.",9,0,1,16 May 2002
Southpaw," One of the Best of 2015 - Acting (and Directing)
","Antoine Fuqua, like Todd Field, knows how to get the best from his actors. He directed a Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role win for Denzel Washington and Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role nomination for Ethan Hawke with the landmark Training Day (2001). He directed Hawke again along with Richard Gere and Don Cheadle with the fine Brooklyn's Finest (2009) and now 'Southpaw' may be his crown achievement even if slightly formulaic feel good tough boxing movie.Now, he literally trains with and transforms Jake Gyllenhaal into the fictional boxer Billy Hope. Hope is a high profile boxer who has issues and when his life turns for the worse he is a sad human mess played to perfection by Gyllenhaal who's Oscar Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role nomination for Brokeback Mountain (2005) may be backed by a Leading Role nod for this which he barely missed for Nightcrawler (2014) with more deserving top notch tough competition but was nominated for Golden Globes.Forest Whitaker who played the Golden Globe Best Actor nominee dejected, drunk and talented Bird (1988) now plays the bruised but wise mentor and coach in 'Southpaw'. In this subtle supporting role, he hasn't been this good since his momentous Oscar win for The Last King of Scotland (2006). Rachel McAdams is beyond believable as Hope's wife and may get her first supporting actress nom if the stars are aligned although her part may be overlooked for various reasons. Her acting performance is however crucial to the whole storyline and she pulls it off and then some.Last but not least, Oona Laurence plays Hope's daughter with depth and takes control of powerful scenes. We haven't seen strong child acting like this for a long time - think Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense (1999) not Quvenzhane Wallis in Beasts of the Southern Wild (2012). Even better than 2015 worthy co-favourite film 'Room' performance by Jacob Tremblay. Other current contenders for best of the year I have seen and agree with are Scott's 'The Martian' and Villeneuve's 'Sicario' sans Gyllenhaal. I haven't seen Spielberg's 'Bridge of Spies', Zemickis' 'The Walk', Boyle's 'Steve Jobs,' Crowley's 'Brooklyn', or Haynes' 'Carol', and I am anticipating 'The Revenant' from one of my long time favourite directors like everyone else.Gyllenhaal who's work with Villeneuve in Enemy and Prisoners proved he is a formidable lead in 2013, garners much attention here and Fuqua and his film will make waves before his Magnificent Seven remake hits the theatres next year... with Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.This movie will have you feeling, thinking and cheering for the growth, not the glory.Bon cinema!PS: look out for Cheadle's directorial debut 'Miles Ahead' as well.",9,1,2,4 November 2015
Incendies," Buy the Blu-Ray; Thank Me Another Day
","Having received rave reviews and been familiar with the quality of Denis Villeneuve's work, especially in Polytechnique, I did what I do rarely and bought this without having seen it previously. I was not disappointed in the least.War. Death. The story starts strong and will bring you to a voyage in space, time, thought and emotion along with the characters. The writing, directing, editing and cinematography are outstanding. The acting is rather natural and from the gut. Many scenes feel so real and personal. At times you may feel dirty as a urinal. This is not a feel good movie. This is a hard movie that deserves to be seen. It beautifully explores the ugliness of war. It shows that intolerance, hate and bigotry passed down by generations and cultural conditioning are hindering our quality of life and depriving as of true respect & dignity in our dim human condition. This is true everywhere, even in Canada where the quality of life, physical security and cultural openness are arguably among the very best in the world.The story's backdrop balances between realities of peace, education and prosperity and plunges us through the chaos of rejection, violence, fear and family feud in search of redemption and truth. We see a nondescript Arab country with a Christian minority's imprint on its people. We are reminded of recent or ongoing similar situations in the Middle East and Africa, but also in Europe and Asia in the not so distant past. Yugoslavia, Cambodia, etc. Discrimination, children army, murders, massacres,etc. The best humankind has to offer or so it seems...This story goes there, dark, deep, dangerously borderline depressing, yet with a unflinching conviction that telling the tale and finding the truth may not actually liberate, but may allow us to get it straight. Perhaps to finally get it right.There are many symbols and silent unsaid commentaries in the movie, but the narrative also speak volumes in many ways. The reflection is real and relevant. How can we live and leave a better future for our children? How can we brake the destructive and devastating cycle of war and hate?As if the movie was not enough, we are also privy to Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette's stunning making-of documentary :Se souvenir des cendres - Regards sur Incendies http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1756720/ which takes a life of its own with revealing interviews,crisp cinematography, eloquent editing, poetic vision and spellbinding storytelling. It is easily the best making-of documentary I have ever seen.For all these reasons go buy it. Sell your weapon if you have to.",9,1,7,4 October 2011
The Matrix Revolutions," Entertaining, fitting; no need to tear it apart
","Revolutions.  I enjoyed it.  (It helped that I saw it in IMAX as the experience was considerably amplified) I found that it was a fitting ending to the Trilogy (although some won't like it, they will have to agree that it was well thought-out and was true to the rhythm of the two other movies). The philosophy and action were both present and of high standards.  Some general and specific questions remain unanswered and it made you think.  Mr. Smith's dialogue notably had a lot to ponder upon.  As for the action, although I was initially apprehensive about the CGI robot fight for Zion, I have to say I was very pleased with the results and felt tension and excitement.  Niobe's intense piloting was also very pleasing visually and paced well within the unfolding drama.   It is true that the chemistry between Moss and Reeve was missing (especially when they kissed), but that was true of all three movies.  I felt much more love between Link and his wife!!  and speaking of secondary characters, they all did a great job, even that annoying kid from Reloaded... The Oracle was not the same without Gloria and Monica was seriously underused.  The one scene she appeared in also turned out to be pretty pathetic.  Mr. Smith's character was great as a whole, but when he came to the 'real' world, it did not add much to the story and it was not particularly well handled by the writers/directors.  We could criticize all we want (the almost anticlimactic final fight, etc.), but push come to shove the movie had a lot to offer and was not a disappointment but rather explored different aspects of the same themes advanced in one and two, with a pretty good mixture of sci-fi, action, philosophy and they even had a few well-orchestrated emotional moments...

Dreamgirls," Golden Globe Winner
","Although Little Miss Sunshine was probably a slightly better movie in 2006, this musical deserves all the praise it is receiving as it delivers a great cinematic experience. Beyonce's worthy performance showed range but didn't get her a win in both her nomination for best song and best actress. Eddie Murphy WAS soul and was extremely believable and charismatically eclectic in his role that won him a Golden Globe. Hands down one of the best performance in film this year, it reminds me a bit of the immersion into the character of Ray that Jamie Fox did a few years back. Jamie is great here too and breathes the business-mindedness of his role. A central character to the movie that is a great contrast to the beautiful & creative aspects of art. And art it is. The songs, the acting, the editing, directing & the story all mesh together to give us a fantastic voyage into the world of stardom. Being a musical, the actors sometimes break out in songs, but they are always welcomed and never feel forced. Almost perfect, a few moments of the films could have been slightly fine-tuned with perhaps an extra take or a change of camera angle, but the movie basically carries well from start to finish.The music is great and the way it is incorporated in the movie works very well, allowing also for the fact they they are singers. This works better than say Oscar-winner Chicago which was a darker, different type of musical. Dreamgirls is light-hearted fun, but the depth of creative efforts from everyone involves is exemplary.The other big Globe winner is of course Jennifer Hudson, who had a real life similar ascension to stardom in American Idol (which I don't watch and did not even know she was in until after I saw the movie). She does provide both the VOICE of the movie and the fresh-eyed emotional acting that justifies her big win. She seems to be perfectly soothed for the role and it was a great choice to get her involved. The casting was in fact dead on for all the parts. This movie set the bar higher for musicals and movies in general with a keen eye for storytelling across eras, fame and personal tribulations. Go see Dreamgirls. Go be impressed.",9,2,4,19 January 2007
Ratatouille," Bird's Rat -- Memorable Movie Night Part 1: The Animated Movie
","One night, three great movies. Let's start with the appetizer: Ratatouille.This family fun, yet mainly mature, sweet and sarcastic tale is Brad Bird's reserved creation. Even if in Paris, the setting is dingy and involves rats in a kitchen. Yet, Bird is the one to receive an original screenplay Oscar nomination for 'Incredibles, The (2004)', an animated movie about superheroes. Even so, it comes as a pleasant surprise to see Bird's writing and directing easily transcend this potentially contrived plot and make a funny and heartfelt movie in almost every aspect. The message it carries is positive and poetic and the film is forgiven its occasional slapstick comedy moments or predictability to (hopefully) make it slightly more appealing to the younger audience and thus more marketable.The initial introduction and characterization had me entertained, but slightly worried, but once the film got rolling, I was pretty much enthralled throughout: out-loud laughing, smiling or fighting a tear. A feel good movie and a good story. Don't expect Shrek's flatulence or average talking-animal humour. Expect more of the witty humour from The Incredibles, minus the action, plus a bit more depth in dialogue and human soul-searching. Disney's magic? Well, this film has the intangible that makes it all work together.",9,1,2,10 July 2007
Jackie," Pablo Larraín and Nathalie Portman make Jackie emotional, complex and real
","Jackalie portmanteau could be used to describe the results of the tremendous skill Portman put into portraying the iconic Jackie Kennedy. Director Pablo Larraín takes a strong script which focuses on a compelling and complex individual faced with a drama-intense week at the highest level of personal, family and state/world turmoil and makes it visceral with his vision. Portman is pitch perfect and although La La Land is probably my favourite movie of the decade, I am not certain I can say Stone deserved the Best Actress award more than this nuanced controlled breakdown and bravery in face of adversity acting tour de force.Inventive and risky editing (Sebastián Sepúlveda)and music (Mica Lei) are other key elements to tell this story emotionally and immerse the viewer in the near meltdown. The supporting cast shines on occasion even though Nathalie casts shadows on everyone with her brilliant role. Acting legend John Hurt delivers some soothing and straightforward philosophy as the priest who gets to hear Jackie's deepest fears and secrets - while we see some of the best cinematography from Stéphane Fontaine who has many other great visual pleasers and shockers in this and did marvels in French productions A Prophet (2009), Rust and Bones (2012) and Elle (2016). This will be one of his last role before his death at age 77 two months ago. Peter Sarsgaard who shined in The Experimenter (2015) gives a few good counterpoints and delivers some well-written lines as Bobby concerning his brother's possible legacy.Watch Bobby (2006) for the rest of the Kennedy story five years later. A completely different but equally captivating multi-layer narrative by Emilio Estevez.",9,0,2,7 April 2017
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Very Good Ending, but way too long...
","Based on a book, the pacing may have been long, necessary and useful in the novel, but from the beginning, I felt that this movie was going nowhere following a bunch of bandits and their uneventful, uninteresting lives. If someone got caught up in the legendary tales of Jesse James like a good portion of America at the time, I certainly did not from watching the movie. Yes, Brad Pitt and director Andrew Dominik portray him as a more down-to-earth, conflicted person which is fine, yet, there is no transmission to the viewer of the type of blind admiration that Richard Ford feels for him.The younger Affleck, Casey, plays the younger brother of the two 'side-kick wannabes' of Jesse James and his older brother. He plays the coward well and is a good counterpart to Pitt's outwardly assurance. From the title, even though it is strategically not actually shown in the beginning of the movie, we know that Ford is going to kill Jesse James. We don't know how and we don't know exactly why, although we have a strong suspicion.Visually, there are a few great moments. Scenery. The outdoors. Horses. Houses. America at the end of the 19th century. Yet, the movie is too static, the story too uninvolving. Not having read the book, but being privy to surely to some of its passages in the voice-over narration, I have to say that I imagine that writer Ron Hansen's delightful descriptions were much more potent than even good actors in a room with regular lines and not much to do. In fact the best parts of the movie were this passages which makes me think that the book may have had additional richness not well translated in the film.In any case, especially at close to 3 hours, this film did not work. The last half hour (the leading up and the aftermath of the assassination) were by far the best part of the movie. If that type of cunning film-making, introspection and moving storyline could have served the rest of the movie, I would be rooting too. Yet I cannot say why this film is so highly-regarded as it stands now and as I have seen it last night. Better luck next time.",5,4,9,15 November 2007
Across the Universe," Julie Taymor's musical or modern Beatles music videos
","Julie Taymor intrigued me with her visceral adaption of Shakespeare's Titus (1999), dazzled me by putting Frida's canvasses to life over Salma Hayek's brilliant performance in Frida (2002), and I was hoping that her keen visual style would make this musical magical. I was hoping for Moulin Rouge! (2001); I was hoping too much.Tying this to Frida, the beautiful Hayek is back (without the unibrow) for a visual feast of a cameo in a well choreographed and edited scene. In fact, as whole, the visual aspects works very well and even if Rodrigo Prieto (one of the best cinematographers of the decade) went on to do bigger and better things after Frida, Bruno Delbonnel, which did Le fabuleux destin d'Amelie Poulain (2001), is a well-abled replacement. The compositions are artsy, refined, innovative and give life to the movie more than the music or the story. Unfortunately, the main problem of the movie is that beyond that visual prowess, the movie is disjointed and often feels more like a collection of successive music videos-- a sort of more refined typical Bollywood musical. The story is lacking and the adventure is not propelled in the way that say a 'Big Fish (2003) was able to while remaining far-out and visually over-the-top. As such, many 'videos' are well-worth the watch ('Strawberry Fields' and 'Let it Be' to name two), but some do not really work like the rooftop finally. Musically, first off, I am not a big Beattles fan so that did not help and I much preferred the music of Rent(2005), which the rebellious mood of the story reminded me of, Chicago (2002) and Dreamgirls (2006). The other problem with using Beatles song is that they do not work as well as songs that were conceived to move the narrative along as in a real musical. Also, when i comes to musical editing there is only one song that has has a strong musical dialogue with another song. Overall, I was very disappointed with the musical aspect in terms of music and lyrics. I don't think that even using Lennon's 'Imagine'-that was not used-could have saved it in my eyes, but Beatles fan may like it more or be even more critical, I'm not sure.Still, quite a few nice directing choices and great execution can be seen. The scene where Sadie and Jojo fight on stage is great, Bono's appearance and the following funkadelic bus ride is interesting, the water sequences and the circle in the grass are memorable... A few breathtaking strokes of Taymor's artistry, but no strong backbone like the tale of Hayek's Frida. Keep at it Taymor, but I hope for a more complete piece next time.",6,5,10,15 November 2007
The Elephant Man," Classic in many ways
","This is straightforward Lynch a la The Straight Story (1999), but with a keener, more epic and visceral directing. This was setup to be classic material from the start. The retelling of this popular, grotesque and intriguing tale, the deliberate use of Black & White, the extensive makeup, the complexity required on the actors. Well, Lynch didn't flinch.The people that got involved in the project were extremely talented: from the arts department to Freddie Francis chosen to do the B&W cinematography to fine British actors Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt (from 'I, Claudius' fame). Lynch exploited this for all its worth and provided a beautifully made film with visual aesthetics, captivating lead performances and a story that seems to tell itself in a seductive, self-revealing way.Slightly uneven at times, the meticulousness of the picture always refocuses the attention to the story, the man, the monster: The Elephant Man.",8,1,1,10 July 2007
The Game," Nice birthday present
","I saw this movie in theater on its opening weekend.  It was my birthday and I felt like giving myself a small birthday present.I sat there enthralled and engaged in the plot.  The tension and intrigue were great, emanating from great directing and a believable performance from the entire cast.  It makes you think and try to fit the pieces together, while remaining slightly edgy and always moving forward.  The best part of the movie is its slightly eccentric, but ultimately original and daring script that made Nicolas Van Horton's birthday present my birthday present worthwhile.You cannot forget an ending like this.  Some did not care for it much, most loved it, I simply adored it.  I sat there end watched the screen even as the credit rolled and kept saying to myself 'I can't believe he did that, I can't believe they did that'.  Refering both to the character and the writing team (who wrote 'Terminator 3, coming to a theater near you' by the way).  Unbelievable.It helps that talented David Fincher was able to work with this crazy script, keeping it dark and intriging and bringing it to its ultimate climax.Must see.",9,0,1,6 February 2003
Ex Machina," Oscar Isaac and Alex Garland
","Oscar Isaac tops even his Golden-Globe nominated conflicted Cohen character performance in Inside Llewyn Davis. He is crisp, charming, alarming and aptly takes control of the movie in almost every moment.Alex Garland for his part tackles his directorial debut with his best screenplay to date, an intelligent and refined intellectual intrigue in the tradition of the minimalist science-fiction genre, and with four fine actors that play off each other perfectly.The setup, story and suspense are successful even if the climax denouement is missing a certain element of evolution and realism. Minor faults cannot weaken the strength of the perpetually powerful dialogues and decidedly perturbing thoughts about artificial intelligence and its implications. The characters are nuanced and noteworthy and the setting is that of natural and architectural beauty.Oscar Isaac and Alex Garland are both to watch in the future at the Oscars and other awards.",8,1,2,15 July 2015
Transformers," More humor than action
","Michael Bay's new blockbuster is doing well in the theater. It takes the 80s cartoons premise and puts in the the 21st century with cell phones and ebay...The story is not the strong point of the movie. Afterall, this is based on material made for kids in order to incite them to buy toys. I was one of these kids in the 80s and still have some Transformers somewhere at my mother's house, so I was familiar with the concept, although not hardcore--for instance, I knew about Optimus Prime and Megatron, but only remembered of Bumble Bee once they mentioned his name; I recognized some robots, but no other names. This movie was partly targeted to my demographic that regard this as nostalgic of our youth, but also to a new generation of kids & teenagers.Once you accept that the story is going nowhere fast, the movie is quite successful. It has one-dimensional characters, but excellent one-liners. What surprised me the most from Bay, which I regard highly in terms of action sequences, is that the humor was better than the action. The CGI work was good (not great) and some interesting action finally occurred near the end. I'm thinking of a few great shots in the street like a transformer that jumps over a woman in slow motion... but overall the action was not up to par to Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor & Bad Boys II in my humble opinion.The comedy did work for me and my friends though. We laughed quite a bit and a few nods were there for the casual fans of Transfomers like myself.Overall, this movie was an entertaining summer flick. Do not expect a masterpiece, but expect to be thoroughly entertained for 144mins. Oh yeah, I almost forget for those who care, but the two female leads are hot, very hot. Sure to give a few more tickets sales for a movie like this. But with Bay, it's mostly all jokes and eye-candy anyway.Lastly, there is quite a bit of product placement, mainly GM & eBay. What can you do in a world that revolves not only around the Sun, but around money...",7,1,3,20 July 2007
La La Land," Life-Affirming Artistic Masterpiece Awaits Awards
","Damien Chazelle dazzled with Whiplash (2014). Pace, acting, music, struggle and storytelling sure hit. He had toyed with the musical idea when at Harvard with low budget and black & white Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench (2009). He now delivers beyond any expectations.An Oscar-tying record of 14 nominations and rave reviews if just a reflection of how good this is. More than all that this movie is a collection of transporting feelings: freedom, love, passion, infatuation, nostalgia. It explores dreams, hopes, fears, sacrifices and reality. It has gorgeous and appropriate fantastic elements that add layers instead of detract from the story. Like Titanic (1997), although a different beast all together, I cried, I laughed, I smiled and was transported.Ryan Gosling and especially Emma Stone sell ever detail with their extraordinary skills and dedication. They are often spell-binding. An on-screen chemistry and crafted from an assured writing and directing vision that take us places movies have never taken us before. The best Musical since Moulin Rouge! (2001) fifteen years ago with added cool choreography and gusto. Cold Fish (2010) was the last movie that blew my mind in such a graphic, edge of the seat, emotional, artistic, fantastic and physical way. It also had a theme of planetarium and stars. I am so glad I saw this in theatres too and in IMAX with incredible image and sound. Talking about sound and music, Justin Hurwitz gets 3 Oscar nods for his score and two songs: quirky City of Stars and adorable Audition (The Fools Who Dream). Audition is a tour de force visual and visceral scene from Stone and bittersweet song. Hurtitz should come home with one or likely two statuettes after been looked over in Whiplash (2014). The Jazz in both films is magical, but here there are other elements of music (even to the choice of 80s pop music in the mix) and there is the explanation of jazz origins and essence that enhances the music as art and is contrasted with John Legend radio-friendly record-selling reality which books tours and pays bills.Sharp (C-sharp?) Chazelle deserves his two Oscars but has though competition in both writing and directing including the return of writer/director Kenneth Lonergan after bar-raising You Can Count on Me (2000) and Margaret (2011). Canadian Denis Villeneuve's Arrival (2016) which is nominated for 8 Oscars and 9 BAFTAs is also a contender although not my personal favourite film of his.The only assured Oscar win would be Tom Cross for Editing who won for Whiplash (2014) and put every beautiful detail of Damien in a dizzying and delicate succession, but I predict La La Land could sweep the Oscars. I guess it could get from 10-13 Oscars potentially beating the 11 wins tree-way tie of epic Ben-Hur (1959), Titanic (1997) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). It won 7 out of 7 Golden Globes and should win a fair share of its 11 BAFTA Awards nominations this Sunday. Wishing it long life and success. Hard to beat something that steals your breath and hard beat for 2 hours like this.Not just a movie experience, a revelation! Rejoice, live, love, sing and dance...L.A. Hollywood - La La Land is the best Hollywood film of the decade or maybe the millennium...",10,2,8,9 February 2017
Reservoir Dogs," Simple, Witty and Fresh
","This little gem takes place almost entirely in a deserted warehouse, but offers some of the best dialogue in film history.  From Mr.Pink's 'no tipping policy' to Mr.White and Mr.Blonde's hilarious dispute to Mr.Orange self-encouraging words in front of the mirror, all the way up to the last line of the movie.  What Tarantino has done is take this solid script,his best yet, fine some great actors suited to the roles and show the world what a great director he truly is. The result: A classic. The right mixture of intrigue, innovation, character development, humor and good-hearted fun. Even better in some aspects than the infamous Pulp Fiction. 9/10",9,0,1,20 February 2002
There Will Be Blood," Oscar Favorite Has Plenty Going For It
","The Academy has been keeping on eye on writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson (PTA)'s work as a modern voice of cinema. It has been ten years since Boogie Nights (1997) was nominated for Best Screenplay as well as two supporting role acting nods. Later, Magnolia (1999) also received a Best Screenplay nomination (PTA) and Best Supporting Actor (Cruise) as PTA took a talented cast and pushed film's boundaries with an excruciating pace and an ending that strangely remained sober in its farfetchedness. Punch-Drunk Love (2002) did not get any Oscar nomination and is perhaps not as accomplished as his two previous, yet it did win him Best Director at Cannes no less! It proved that he was an engaging director that could translate his familiarity with his work and characters to allow his actors (yes, even Adam Sandler) to give meaningful and memorable performances. It also ascertained his down-to-earth slow-paced style, even if the actual movie was 95 mins compared to his previous drawn out 150mins+ endeavors.In this context, PTA is back with a vengeance and gets 8 nominations for this film, including (again) Best Adapted Screenplay, but also Best Picture and Best Actor (this time in a Leading Role.) This one is back to the long narrative at over 2h30 and starts very slowly with a dialog-less beginning reminiscent of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)'s overture. When the dialog begins, we get a glimpse of the great sound and picture editing that is to come and permeate the film throughout. The score consists of almost isolated notes that create and release the tension. It is quite suited to the piece as, like the story that it tells, there is nothing too melodious about it. Not surprinsingly, PTA chooses to tell the story slowly but surely. There is many long takes with beautiful cinematography and plenty of moments without dialog. When there is dialog however, it is potent and to the point. The story unravels as the many twists and turns come to past and everything is connected somehow. The real complexity is however revealed in the third and final act (note that the church is named the third revelation) where everything comes into question and stirs conflict while the dialog and acting turn from boiling to iron-hot. This strong ending is born out of the earlier scenes. It captivates and cumulates all the way to the last line: 'I'm finished.'As for the acting, Daniel Day-Lewis gives a riveting performance as charismatic and enigmatic Daniel Plainview, topping even his remarkable Oscar-winning take on debilitated Christy Brown in My Left Foot (1989) and getting better and better as the story progresses. Paul Dano, from Little Miss Sunshine (2006) fame, gives a calculated counterpart performance as the town's eminent young religious figure. He gives some especially strong scenes and something can also be said for young Dillon Freasier's portrayal of Daniel's son.At the end of the day, this is a fine film with a hard look at America's and human's ambition and greed. It deals with themes of family, community, religion and entrepreneurship in an interesting and interwoven way. A great addition not only to PTA's catalog, but to the art of cinema in general.",8,4,9,14 February 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Depiction of a dictator and a doctor
","James McAvoy plays Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, a young Scottish physician who is seduced by the likable Idi Amin, freshly President of Uganda, in becoming his personal doctor, confident, political player and friend.Eventually Garrigan starts to have doubts about Amin's regime and mental health, as he flirts with both good and bad aspects of power. He also flirts with one of his wives (played by Regina Washington)and delves into a game of deceit with the dictator.Forest Whitaker's portrayal of the troubled, charismatic leader is riveting and worthy of all the attention and awards it got him, but James McAvoy's performance is a very good counterpoint to the story in general, and in the many scenes they have together in particular. These are probably the best scenes of the movies and are intricately woven from fine dialogue and dead-on performances.The ending was a little unoriginal and seemed a bit forced and not well explored. It could have had a better treatment and tied all the elements in a better, smoother way, I suspect. The last line of the movie is appropriately ironic and humorous, however.The viewpoint of a foreign doctor thrusted into Ugundan politics and slowing learning of the implications is an interesting one and makes for a great story. The viewer thus explore with him the money, power, respect, loyalty, authority, politics, danger, fame, the glory and the gory...The fragility of a country and of a man.",8,1,3,24 November 2007
American Gangster," American Gangster = American Hero
","Pros: Interesting story and strong performance by Denzel. Cons: Predictable. A few directing and acting flaws.In the tradition of Blow (2001), here is a real American Hero...America has been glorifying gangsters way before hip hop and gangster rap, way before television 'The Sopranos' (1999), hit movies Scarface (1983) and Goodfellas (1990). Guns and seemingly limitless funds (read 'fun') were an end and a mean (by a mean I refer to both the demeanor and misdemeanor, and I mean by any means necessary) before the Godfather (1972) et al. had every prototypical Italian American and his neighbour imitate Brando, Pacino, De Niro or Pesci ad nauseum and quote lines of gangster movies like people used to quote Shakespeare. The American Dream, before 'American Idol ' (2002) produced prefab Pop Stars, was of an entrepreneurial spirit realistically closer to the original spirits-bootlegging Scarface than say an arguably antisocial, enigmatic, Bill Gates. America's gun culture endures. Thus the title of the movie alone, alas, says a lot about the American subconscious. This may even go beyond the United States boundaries as Hollywood and U.S. influence on the world culture is still very powerful--in Japan, you have the Yakuzas From Bonnie and Clyde (1967) to American Gangster (2007), movies about money and violence has been very popular. For example, there is a clear preponderance of high ratings for such movies in the Internal Movie Database – IMDb, the most popular movie website in America and on the planet. At the time of this original article (Nov 2007), four out of the five overall best- rated movies in the TOP 250 out of hundreds of thousands are of that kind! In this rendition of the gangster movie genre which focuses on a clever, ruthless 'black man' in Harlem's 1960s who builds a drug empire, the glorifying is not overt, yet it is not really made in a way that you will realistically root for the 'good cop' instead of the 'bad a*s villain'. The movie has depth in content in that it deals with connected racial tension and government involvement in corruption and drug trafficking. A big angle to the tale is that bypassing regular drug channel and getting the product straight from the source in Far-East Asia with the help of the US Army in Vietnam, this 'black man' or nig*r (America's subclass or worse than nothing) was able to overshadow even the Italian Mafia's chokehold on organized crime, which unsettled more than a few people from both sides of the law. Also, the systematic corruption in New York law-enforcement agencies that permitted the fight on drug trafficking to be very lax as well as these state employees actually profiting from this decadence in the streets, was brought to light and to life quite vividly. In this picture, Denzel dazzles and is a great villain in his portrayal of Frank Lucas, although not to the degree of his Oscar- worthy Training Day (2001) performance. He gets a chance to shine occasionally and more so towards the end, but the script and directing did not allow him to show his full arsenal on celluloid. Russell Crowe plays a cop again (L.A. Confidential, 1997) and is as subdued as his character. What I did not like is that the subplot of his personal life, although maybe interesting on paper and a worthy contrast to add complexity and not fall into black-and-white territory, did not really work and detracted instead of enhanced the picture. These were the only parts that really felt long and underused out of the otherwise well-paced 157 minutes. Carla Gugino did not really hit the mark as the wife, but it seemed to me that it was more of a storytelling mishap out of Ridley Scott's directing. He should have handled it differently to have a better impact or not use it at all and maybe spend more time on Frank Lucas' personal or 'professional' life. Besides this little lack of character development that can be seen for pretty much most of the characters, the film is a good story, well told and well placed into the context of the time and place of the narrative. The conclusion wraps everything up nicely. Thank you, come again.",7,0,2,9 January 2017
Ray," A Ray of Sunshine in the Bleakness of Life
","Foxx was blind, Foxx was a drug-addict, Foxx was a musical genius, Foxx was Ray Charles. The mannerism, the charisma, the conflict, the love... everything was there. And the Oscar goes...Beyond that, this movie is a masterpiece in its own right. The directing, editing & screenplay all very powerful. The music, the business, the family, the affairs, the drug, the fame, the power, the self-deception and self-discovery. We go through Ray Charles life from his strengths and demons of childhood to the making a musical legend and conflicted man. Kerry Washington and Regina King add credence to Jamie's acting by giving strong performances opposite him. I am surprised that Kerry did not get more recognition as Ray's loving, but understandably troubled wife.When the movie ends, you feel you have gone through the joys, the pains, the hardships and saw the light at the end. The process was that of discovery. As Ray reinvented himself many times as a prolific gifted musician that breathes music, he also had to reinvent himself finally as a man. Terrific achievement.",9,1,2,22 January 2007
Arrival," Villeneuve is masterful, but hints on mainstream while missing some opportunities
","Aliens, first contact, language and non-linear or circular time are all the elements of great science-fiction films like Contact (1997) and Interstellar (2014) which prevail in Arrival (2016) which just arrived in theatres last week. Three of Steven Spielberg's sci-fi movies deal with first contact: Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial (1982) and War of the Worlds (2005). They all approach it very differently. Here Denis Villeneuve who's last five films I have enjoyed immensely does a superb job with the material and keeps it edgy and unconventional. He focuses on the unorthodox methods and wonder of linguist Dr. Louise Banks, played by Amy Adams, while she tries to decipher the intentions of aliens arriving on Earth. The movie is getting rave reviews by critics and moviegoers alike and I am proud as a Quebec native myself and a fan of the humble and fantastic filmmaker. However, I must admit a few things prevented me from connecting completely with the characters and the narrative here. The science and language part are well dealt with and with occasional humour, but I am very critical about the constant military framework and the claustrophobic feel that does not insight fear or more importantly enough wonder.Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and even more so Zemeckis'Contact (1997) had at their core wonder and danger. Jodie Foster's portrayal of Ellie has a deep passion, reverence and awe about her opportunity to be the primary first contact human that I didn't quite find in Louise's matter-of-fact characterForest Whitaker is underused and almost one-dimensional, while Jeremy Renner delivers as Ian, but is no Matthew McConaughey. It is possible that no science-fiction movie will equal the elevation of Contact, but if a director could have done it, I had my bets or hopes on Villeneuve. He seemed happy with the script by Eric Heisserer, but I think it could have been better adapted from Ted Chiang's short story I have admittedly not read yet.I did not connect with any character. Did we need more screen time to get to know General Shang (Tzi Ma)'s perspective and related to the fear? Could the daughter scenes capture more moving and relevant elements? The movie remained intellectual, but I did not get the emotional and visceral part.I was hoping brilliant composer and Villenuve's partner in crime, Jóhann Jóhannsson, could help simultaneously alienate and intrigue us. Perhaps help make us fear and feel, but he lacks his usual swagger here and Max Richter in facts provides the best sonic complement with its song 'On the Nature of Daylight' also used by Scorcese in Shutter Island (2010) which Villeneuve integrates to the compelling opening, but that somehow lost some of its appeal by the end reprise when some elements and emotions do not quite fit.Again the militaristic feel worked well in Sicario (2015), but I found it had less it's place here or should have been better balanced not to end up as a caricature if showing pacific and scientific aims may have higher values was a goal.The major plot twist and the climax worked well. The scene when Louise actively confronts the chain of command is riveting, but contrasted to lackluster other scenes where Louise drifts off and does her thing almost as an afterthought. Her character often shows ambivalence, but does best when it turns into conviction.So there is a lot of good film material in here, but just not the masterpiece it could have been for me for these reasons. Perhaps the editing by best of class Joe Walker did not present the story in the right way for me either. I will even try another viewing eventually, but I can only hope Blade Runner 2049 who should be about done filming now in Fall (with Roger Deakins who was missing in this project!! - no offence to young and gifted Bradford Young) delivers more punch next year. In the meantime, Zemeckis' Allied (2016) comes out next week which could be riveting drama and Star Wars: Rogue One (2016) hits theatres next month for more sci-fi. Happy November!",9,0,5,17 November 2016
Marriage Story," Best film of 2019
","I have seen 8 films of Noah's generally positive and thought-provocative filmography and considered While We're Young and The Squid and the Whale are his best, until this gem came along.The Squid and the Whale also looks at a family going through divorce and is very effective.
Marriage Story's screenplay is however so realistic, depressing, funny and dynamic even in limited range of events that is surpasses all expectations. The directing is precise and highlights all the mixed emotions, conundrums and contradictions. The couple's inner conscious and subconscious life as opposed to their demeanors and actions are so spot on. The acting by the two leads are spectacular. They both got nominated for Oscars and Golden Globes. I personally think Scarlett should have won. Even if Adam may have been bested by Joachim, the magic of seeing both of them interact against each other in a few key scenes including the most intense one is what makes it an outstanding piece. Laura Dern's delicious take on the smart, seductive,cut-throat lawyer is deserving to win both Oscar and Golden Globe Best Supporting Actress. The legal aspects of the divorce are both frustrating and comical. They are costly in money but also in humanity. It gets ugly and probably worse in real life.The film and screenplay were also both nominated for both top awards. There is not much better made films about relationships falling apart ever made. There is a nod in the film to seminal Scenes from a Marriage masterpiece by Bergman and perhaps Farhadi's A Separation also comes closest to represent this harsh reality.This film is almost too close for comfort for anyone who has lived a similar separation as a child or a part of the couple. It feels real and emphasises, without direct finger-pointing, the lack of judgement, love, humanity and humility. When the separation starts to spin out of control, both inner and outer forces seem to be pulling in all directions and wrecking often irreparable destruction.A fine film and fair warning.Wishing you all a happy and long-lasting marriage.",10,6,9,19 February 2020
La Vie En Rose," French Finesse
","Olivier Dahan gets it right with mood and great storytelling while Marion Cotillard creates an impertinent, perturbed, passionate character with her riveting performance. The story has a lot of rags-to-riches aspects to it, but goes beyond the luck, perseverance, talent to carry a propelling story arc held together by great music choices and sound editing. Although 140 minutes long, no scene feels really forced or out of place. In fact after the journey, you almost wish it was slightly longer so you can a get even more of a glimpse of that fascinating character, her life and how it evolved externally and internally from 'La Mome Piaf' to Edith Piaf, international superstar.The most powerful pivotal scene is dealt with a deft hand by our dear director who successful confuses the audience as much as Edith feels and that let the missing pieces coalesce into a melodramatic monumental meltdown of majestic, almost magic, moment of clarity with matching magnitude of a myriad of emotions. Much merit is deserved for that idea and execution.As for the ending, it is very becoming. It is predictable, but predictable in the scene that the whole movie built up to it and the the audience cannot wait to experience it as it just. Edith loves her music, loves her audience and we also love her in our own way and for our own reasons. Great piece of film and congratulations to everyone who brought this well-thought, well-paced and well-acted biopic to life. A fine final product.",8,1,4,13 November 2007
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Scarlett Hot and a Hell of a Plot
","Woody is witty and Woody can write. Woody Allen is a legend in his own right. Yet for a writer/director to re-invent himself and become even better after forty plus years of film-making is astonishing. Indeed, we all can appreciate the quintessential Annie Hall (1977) and Manhattan (1979) Woody Allen, yet I must say that with a directorial achievement like Match Point (2005) and this written and directing magnum opus that is Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Allen is reaching his prime at the one-can-only-imagine-but-still-wouldn't-put-it-past-him end of his career! From the premise of two American girls spending a few months in beautiful Barcelona, Spain, to the moment where a Spaniard sweeps them away with one of the best pickup line in film history, this film captures the audience and does not let go. The picture feels like an incredible fantastic voyage with all the nuances and subtleties of a decidedly credible characters, context, complications and conclusion. Allen is able to contrast, appeal, intrigue, attract, convey, question and move. The only way you may want to snooze is if you're a dreamer like some of the characters.Effortlessly, art, language and many iterations of love are explored in an enchanting, engaging and almost transporting way. If the movie had to have one fault it is but an irritating detail I've notice: Vicky is studying Catalan culture and we do not get to hear any Catalan language which is near impossible, the action taking place mostly in Catalan Barcelona. After the New Yorker spent years and films describing, delighting and even naming a movie after his city*, and giving justice to London in his last two Johansson features, Woody will unfortunately get this wrong about the eclectic Barcelona.Scarlett Johansson stole the show in Woody's Match Point (2005) and Scoop (2006), but here she is equally polarized by the challenging and crafty performances of Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz & newcomer Rebecca Hall. Scarlett is her nonchalant gorgeous self, but what creates the sensuous, easy yet forbidden, high sexuality is a sumptuous synergy of the writing, acting and directing. A mental, affecting, visual and visceral arousal is cultivated throughout the movie and takes so many forms that you feel you've been privy to an emotionally charged sexual extravaganza.Beyond the sexual tension, the plot makes for a very interesting, innovative and captivating human relationship roller-coaster as we can expect from an Allen screenplay. We are left with a sort of romantic comedy for grownups. There are no overly graphic sex scenes, yet the movie smells sex and feels sexy from title to credit. Much credit is due to Allen for his vision and his ability to harness acting and technical talent to bring to life this evocative, down-to-earth, film epiphany.'Life is the ultimate work of art.' And how about this for a tagline!?! Simply brilliant, simple but brilliant.. Besides interesting conversational dialog and narrating monologue, Allen's text include such originality as Juan's father not wanting to publish his beautiful poetry in attempts to get back at the world. When Vicky finally asks why, Juan becomes philosophical. Lots to think about, to feel and to digest This motion picture is a daring and savory meal. A poetic paella perhaps * Spike Lee may be the only real contender for hardcore pro-NYC film-making.",10,5,14,11 November 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Best Star Wars Yet - to please both virgins and vets
","How to please franchise fans old and new while making a good impactful and memorable movie?My friends, real fans who grew up with the original trilogy and watched this one with me, expressed a physically relief of feeling there was very little to complain about and that ''they' didn't mess it up', but my feeling was even more positive. They exceeded my high expectations, brought me into a mysterious and magical voyage and left me wanting more until the last frame. A real cinematic experience.Star Wars formula could be deemed to appeal to simplicity (like good vs evil) with a few twists. Fun fact and contingent to the same doctrine, the majority of its meaningful characters name limit themselves to 3 or 4 letters: Han, Luke, Leia, Yoda and now Rey, Poe and Finn. If not letters, we can substitute numbers: R2D2, C3PO or BB8.Well, we can now focus on 2 letters: JJ. J.J. Abrams directs and co-writes this brilliant instalment in the multi-billion franchise which is about to set some box office ridiculous revenues after a record-breaking first day and not counting merchandise and video sales.It also comes with favourable critics and is set to start an epic new trilogy as well as side movies we all hope will remain a high level of quality. Rogue One (2016) is set for next year already, but back to this highly anticipated sequel which manages to create nostalgic moments with its characters, settings and story. Every Star Wars Fans will enjoy the scenery of a defunct Star Destroyer in the desert, but overall cinematography and scenery is in fact the best of all the Star Wars by its beauty and diversity. We get sultry desert in Jakku like Tatooine and forest like Endor. We get beautiful snow that surpass Hoth, buildings and water like Naboo and idyllic Irish-like islands. Daniel Mindel is the cinematographer who also did marvels with JJ on the first 2 Star Trek reboots. Every battle scene is sweeping and spectacular with many elements, motion and emotion. Humour is effective and tension is well crafted and augmented by sound, music and editing.JJ's Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013) was a remake of the essence of Star Trek: Wrath of Khan (1982) and worked well. Here he outdoes himself by creating similar cues from Star Wars themes and storyline, but keeping it crisp with new likable and believable characters, good acting and superb directing to keep everything flowing and fans following. We feel for the characters, old and new, except perhaps BB- 8 which is less lovable than R2-D2. We are intrigued and we do not want it to end. A pretty much perfect movie of the genre and for a new generation, including my 5-year old son and 10-year old brother who loved it, and Rey in particular, missing some deeper subtleties for storyline and character development.Han and Leia were not only there for older fans, but make it work as very important elements to the story. The writing and directing for them is just right, like the rest of the movie. Kylo Ren (4/3 letters, yes) may be the weakest acting and character development, although not bad by any stretch and some noteworthy moments, but we can assume we will get more on him in the next two episodes.Award-worthy, action-packed, well-paced, high expectations delivered and then some. Minor flaws in this sweeping tale that does rely on old material, but makes the movie materialize like a transporter in Star Trek. Best Star Wars yet and that is no small feat. One small step for a fan, but a giant leap for longevity and quality.So in the end we are left with 3 letters: WOW.I am considering seeing again in theatres soon and I have done this less than 10 times in my life (some for stellar but lesser Star Wars (9/10) as well as Star Trek: First Contact, Contact, Titanic and Braveheart) in over 20 year!10/10Capable Rian Johnson has some serious shoes to fill for episode VIII, so we wish him the best. May the force be strong with this one...",10,3,28,20 December 2015
Green Book," Social but personal
","Green Book is a crowd-pleaure and Oscar winner not because it deals with racial tensions in the segregated American recent past, but because it deals with two very human and humane characters who form an unlikely friendship in the midst of a lifechanging and life-affirming road trip. A hallmark of a great film and journey is that the audience or at least myself was left wanting more and deeply care for these characters based on real life people and events. I would have happily hopped on their next road trip to continue to share the intimate details of their endearing bond.The screenplay lead by real life Nick Vallelonga is absolutely absorbing and drips with laugh out loud humour and characterization from the two leads and also some of the supporting cast. Mortenson plays the role of his life and has all the maneurism, talk and conflicted emotions of his flawed and interesting character. Ali assures a stoic and unsympathetic complex personality who excels, perseveres and has is own proclivities. He won the supporting actor Oscar for this while Mortenson was nominated for best lead but was in tough company with Cooper and Malek who won. The screenplay also won best original and deservedly so. Editing was also nominated and the story could not have been really told in a much better way dramatically while hitting all the humour and emotional marks.In the end, although racism, classim, homophobia and other strong and important social subjects are dealt with extremely well, the strength of Green Book lies in its capacity to allow us to discover an average man and his family while changing his preconceived ideas and giving contrasts and thought to an accomplished and inspiring musical genius. Genuinely rewarding cinema and highly recommended.",10,2,5,1 April 2019
Sully," Sully Soars while Plane Performs a Daring Water Landing
","Tom Hanks is in top form and gives his best performance since Cast Away (2000). After playing a man on the 105th floor of the WTC on Sep 11, 2001 in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), he plays a captain of a doomed double-engine failure plane on January 15th, 2009 in NYC. Writing, editing and emotional directing crafts the portrait of this modern day modest hero with bravo. The storytelling choices, non-chronological order, details, scenes and people portrayed all add the the tension and depth of this fascinating, and familiar to some, story. Laura Linney who is always seen only on the phone gives a credible (incredible!) performance, while Aaron Eckhart and his co-pilot character are well utilized.Clint Eastwood ultimately nails it with the right choice of music he also contributes to, like in low-key but grandiose Gran Torino (2008), along with the flashbacks-flashforwards and figments of Sully's imagination to tell the story and inner feelings the best way, and the sheer thrill of a serious and spectacular life and death situation.Everything unfolds perfectly, ends on a high and comical note and feels like hours because of its intensity instead of the taut 96 minutes in actuality, like the only 24 minutes rescue. Thirteen years after the acclaimed Mystic River (2003), Eastwood and 'Sully' safely and improbably land on the river.Like Sully who thanks his co-pilot and crew, the passengers and first respondents for this amazing team effort rescue, Eastwood has many people on his team to thank, including long time contributor but first time real lead editor Blu Murray, for all putting in the pieces together to this cinematic masterpiece.",9,1,2,3 October 2016
The Martian," Long Live Science-Fiction
","Back from a talk from Astronaut Superstar, book author and musician Chris Hadfield in Jasper, Canada where he mentioned the movie as having some of the science and feel right, I am glad I got to see this in immersive IMAX 3D. Not only did it get that right, but more importantly the love for science and science-fiction back like what Hadfield has been able to do with social media and space.Ridley Scott pioneered sci-fi movie-making 3 decades ago with Blade Runner (1982) and Alien (1979) both major entries in the genre. I however found he hit his prime as a director in 2001 (not Kubrick's landmark sci-fi adaptation) with action 'Black Hawk Down' and thriller/horror 'Hannibal' after his Oscar-heavy 'Gladiator' hit of 2000. Body of Lies (2008) was his return to form with a twisted tight thriller and to a lesser degree American Gangster (2007) also starring Russell Crowe.Now 'The Martian' may - should!- get Oscar attention with possible acting, directing, visual effects, sound, editing, cinematography, screenplay and best picture nominations. The screenplay is a wonderful, witty, humane and humorous adaptation of Andy Weir's novel by Drew Goddard who wrote sci-fish Cloverfield and some fantasy TV show episodes.Scott's directing is a great mix of tension, humour, action and crisp narrative. Pietro Scalia made good editing choices that sets this apart from Interstellar's long moments and even if it lacks the vision of Interstellar (2014) it makes it up in ingenuity, laughter and levity making the most of humanity, space and science current frontiers. It exploits the explorer spirit with the human and technical challenges necessary to overcome again and again.From the brisk bang-for-your-buck beginning to the engaging ending with every twist and turn in between, this is a compelling and moving movie that you don't really want to end. Matt Damon is the perfect marooned man on Mars with positivism and sarcasm. His crew-mates and the ground staff are also great characters and supporting actors. The balanced cast is like the editing, enough to keep your attention, keep you guessing and engaged.The storytelling has classic elements of recurring themes and jokes coupled with situations that compound difficulties to be surmounted. The triumph is not only in the story but in the importance of facing these improbable odds as individuals and as a species to surmount space's difficulties. We cannot help but go along readily with the ride and follow the fortuitous and fateful out of this world journey.Early this year I saw the small and smart UK offering Ex Machina (2015) from a nation that is getting good sci-fi out finally. With sublime lesser-known 'OXV: The Manual' and 'The Machine' also from the UK to US heavy hitters 'Gravity' and 'Star Trek Into Darkness', 2013 was a great sci-fi year. Now coupled with Interstellar (2014) and The Martian (2015) as big back-to-back year blockbusters, we can only hope for a revival of the best of this imaginative genre that was made for movies. In fact, I hoped for a movie like this in my Interstellar review almost to the date (release date) last year!Yesterday announced the go-ahead for a New Star Trek series slated for 2017, on top of the 2016 & 2019 movies. Next month will be the first of the much anticipated Star Wars trilogy with Disney and JJ at the helm. 2017 and 2019 will follow and maybe 2 spin offs. Add awaited Avatar sequel trilogy 2017, 2018 & 2019 from James Cameron. All that aside, most importantly the Blade Runner remake is in pre-production with a finished script as we speak to make sure we are back into the Science-Fiction era!! It will be in the capable hands of none other than other great Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve, currently finishing another sci-fi fare, tentatively titled Story of Your Life (2016).I haven't felt this good since Deep Space Nine was on the air...Now if only someone dared to adapt Asimov's Foundation series to screen...Cheers and happy sci-fi decade",9,2,7,4 November 2015
The Island," Bay is an Island
","Michael Bay is the big-budget Hollywood action director film critics love to hate, and although I have enjoyed most of his movies in the past, I am left here with little case to 'defend' him this time around.Although, the beginning of the movie peeked my curiosity with subtle sci-fi that seemed to lead somewhere, the remainder of the movie was melodramatic, cliché and rather unoriginal. A lot of fault obviously reside with the screenplay that starts to weave a story that it is not ready to tell properly. The novelty, intrigue, subtly and humour are soon thrown out the window (like the characters).Bay's fault is two-fold as he gives us little good drama or believable romance and some rather average action sequences as compared to his other much more riveting scenes in his prior movies. A car sequence is in fact a mere variation on the same theme of Bad Boy 2 - minus the healthy humour. It is true that Bay has been more apt at action than drama, but it seems here that he might have been better off picking one or the other if he was to do either correctly.On the good side, the story and concept are quite interesting and the situations lead to some reflections and even a few good laughs before the halfway mark of the movie. Also, the two lead actors do a fine job and bring the viewer in with character presence and quirky idiosyncrasies. They feel real, although the 'romance' doesn't. Steve Buscemi is also his usual good support character and delivers his lines dexterously.The ultimate pitfall of the movie is that the dialog and story are too black & white and try to leave you with a moral high ground acceptance with little actual effort or conviction. The story shows a gross caricature of good, evil and innocence that is certain to insult the audience on some level. It doesn't help also that the action and drama can be overly unbelievable at times and inconsistent.Bottom Line: Good in theory, Average in practice.",6,0,0,26 July 2005
