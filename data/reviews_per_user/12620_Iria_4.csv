Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Are there CGI bloopers?
","Since there are so many comments already, I'm sure the ones that I have have already been repeated in other various places, so I'll just point out some visual discrepancies I noticed during the movie.I will say that the special effects and mecha/landscape/building designs, along with the costumes, were as nice as I had expected them to be. Aesthetically, this is a superior film.  However, I am the sort of individual who appreciates plot complexity and depth, so to see a little more character development and less pod-racing probably wouldn't have induced my dozing off during the middle of the film.  Even still, I would like to point out some interesting things (note, I have only seen this movie once--in a theatre--so my observations may be flawed!):1) In the couple of scenes before the beginning of the pod race, Jar Jar is trailing across the sand behind the other characters (I think...it's been a while).  It's a wide-angle shot, so he's not really close up or in detail, but the camera's close enough to be able to see Queen Amidala & co. leaving footprints in the sand...but Jar Jar doesn't!2) That Queen Amidala sure has a nice chrome-colored silver ship.  Boy, it reflects everything!  The blue sky, the clouds.  What a beautiful day to land in Coruscant.  Ahh, just staring up into the clear, bright sky that is crowded with other airships, watching the objects weave paths above the city horizon...wow, I wonder what kind of finish Amidala uses on her ship to make it so that only the sky, clear of airborne objects, is reflected.Like I said, it's been four months since I saw the movie, so I could possibly be inaccurate or utilize inaccurate reasoning (i.e., maybe it was a physics 'trick' that enabled Amidala's ship to do what it did).  Anyway, the reason why I was so observant on visual effects was because all the other elements of a film failed to maintain my attention.  Actually, I don't think anything (besides the visual effects) really even captured my attention in the first place.  It seems as if there are those who believe that stunning graphics can compromise plot substance.  *yawn* Even trying to come up with other positive points about The Phantom Menace make me sleepy.",4,0,1,17 October 1999
Mulan," It was okay...
","The animation wasn't terribly impressive; at times, it seemed too simplistic, with the quality of shading and attention to detail falling drastically short of say, for example, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King.  In addition, I felt that Disney was trying to stereotype and 'play into' the Chinese culture too much by trying to imitate Chinese music in some of the soundtracks (which, I might add, weren't that great either. Only 'Reflections' I shall acknowledge as being somewhat enjoyable). Mulan's character design is a stereotype in itself.  Since when do Asians really have eyes that tilt at almost a 45 degree angle?  I realize it might seem like a little thing to get so excited over, but I'm Asian, so I am sensitive to details like that simply because I have been the target of many jokes of that ilk during my adolescence.  I also think that Mulan is the most flat-chested Disney human female I've ever seen.  Pocahontas, who, historically, was 13 when Smith 'discovered' her, was stacked.  Of course, there's no stereotype about flat-chested Asians, right (which is entirely a grossly incorrect generalization).  Now all I can say is, 'Gee, thanks, Disney.'  I suppose that some credit should be given, because usually a giant corporation will not take risks by exploring a minority group.  Yet in doing so, they have only played upon the American society's expectations of what Asian culture means to them, but doesn't necessarily reflect the truth.At face value, however, Mulan was entertaining enough.  Granted, this film is supposed to be for little kids, so hey, why not give some of the music a Chinesy feel to make it all cute.  Why not paint Mulan's face entirely white (even though that extent of make-up is used, NOT for matchmaking, but most commonly for Chinese opera).  Let's give the public something familiar, but at the same make it seem exotic and make it appear like we really *heh heh* want to explore Chinese tradition for its inherent value, and not to exploit it for our purposes.  Mulan is something I'll watch when I have absolutely nothing better to do.  Even then, I don't think I'd watch it more than two times.  In the words of a previous reviewer, 'Excuse me, I have to go watch some Anime now.'  Go watch Neon Genesis Evangelion.",4,3,16,18 October 1999
Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind," The difference between Warriors of the Wind and Nausicaa
","Miyazaki's Nausicaa, of the Valley of the Wind, is deeply moving, but in the dubbed version (Warriors of the Wind) that poignancy is lost due to the extensive reinterpretation of the film.  Over 20 minutes were cut, as that company wanted to make it more an animated action movie for its targeted market, rather than attempt to portray the subtleties of human nature. Thus, they edited the 'slow' scenes that gave the film so much of its bittersweet feeling.  Nausicaa is renamed as 'Princess Zandra,' and the sweet-sounding Japanese voice actress for Nausicaa is replaced with the voice of Rocky from Bullwinkle.  Although the first time I saw Nausicaa was in the dubbed format, I still found that the cinematography and music were breathtaking.  I only recently was able to see the uncut version in Japanese, and was shocked to see how much of it was butchered in Warriors of the Wind.  It has been recorded that Miyazaki was horrified at what had been done to his beautiful film.  Perhaps it was good that that happened, because (for those who are aware of Disney's plans to translate his creations) he will not allow his films to be touched in any way, allowing only for a direct translation.  Therefore, should Disney change anything about his anime, it would be an illegal action.",7,4,6,16 May 1999
Princess Mononoke," I liked it
","Another masterpiece by Miyazaki.  The animation is fluid and the cinematography very impressive.  I liked it almost as much as Nausicaa (the Japanese version, NOT the dubbed 'Warriors of the Wind,' which in my opinion should be burned!!).",7,0,2,13 May 1999
