Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good, but not great.
","Everyone knows that Jar Jar and his whole race made this movie not as good as it could have been.  It seems like the Gungans were just created for little kids and to make money off toys for kids.  The first 3 were much better in that the stories were more serious.  Still, this movie was very good and I am expecting the next two to be much better.",7,0,0,19 March 2001
The Mummy Returns," Not as good as the first one.
","*********SPOILERS***********
While this movie is enjoyable, it is no where near as good as the first one. First of all, The Mummy doesn't seem as powerful or as intimidating as he does in the first one.  Then they come up with all this stuff about Brendan Fraser being a warrior of god because he has a tattoo that he didn't have in the first one.  And now Rachel Weisz is the reincarnation of the Pharaoh's daughter and knows how to fight and can navigate pyramids, which she couldn't do in the first one.  The whole movie builds to the showdown with the Scorpion King who turns out to be a big cartoonish monster.Still, this movie has good scenes.  The war scenes with Anubus' army, the sai fighting with Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez, and the fight between Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo.If you enjoyed the first one, this is worth seeing in the theater because of the special effects.",5,0,0,5 May 2001
