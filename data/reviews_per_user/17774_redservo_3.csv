United 93," Watch the Special Features
","This is not a movie, it is a memorial. I was not able to catch this film during it's theatrical release. I believe that it was to my benefit.I rented it through Netflix, and viewed it on a few short days after the fifth anniversary of the actual events. And, unlike the theatrical release alone, it provided the opportunity for the families to voice their emotions, their personal experiences and the raw sense of loss that no movie alone could portray.The film is incomplete without knowing who those 40 people were, and the people they left behind.Tasteful, quiet, painful, real.",10,0,1,13 September 2006
Unbreakable," Not your average movie-Thank God!
","Who says comics have to be campy?I love a good action film just like the next guy, but Unbreakable was not intended to be just-another-cartoon-super-hero-saving-the-world-from-evil. I left the theater completely awed and speechless, yet wanting to say soooo much about the plot, the characters, the haunting cinematography, brilliant use of costuming and perspective, and the fresh, inventive direction.
M. Night Shyamalan has proven himself as a top-notch writer, director and producer with The Sixth Sense. However, w/ Unbreakable, he exceeds even himself with this somber, subtle and methodical film. He has been criticized for his slow-pacing. Instead, he should be heralded for bringing back substance to the cinema. Not since Hitchock, has there been a better psychological director. And just like Hitch, his direction is not just for visual effect, but to inflect mood, character and storyline with a mere camera angle. Although what the audience sees via his inventive camera angles tugs and nudges the audience's psyche, the real brilliance lies in his ability to direct his actors.Bruce Willis has been criticized for 'not acting' in this movie. On the contrary, his subtlety and humanity was right on the money. So little was said, but so much was conveyed. But not all kudos goes to Willis and Shyamalan. The supporting cast is excellent. You know that something's not right w/ Samuel L. Jackson's sympathetic, yet slighty askew character; but you just don't know what until the truth is revealed. Robin Wright was excellent as a confused mother and heart-broken wife.  Spencer Treat Clark was engaging as the dutiful son looking for any excuse to worship a father that doesn't understand himself, much less his family.Well-paced, beautifully directed and strongly acted, Unbreakable is a sign of hope for the fate of cinema; that movies don't have to be predictable, over-the-top, or based on yet-another British literary classic to have substance, integrity and fine performances.Unbreakable proves that the coasters aren't the only thrill rides at the carnival.(But if you still insist on the coaster, just look for the 'Signs'!)",10,0,0,4 August 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Perfect!!
","Beautiful. Epic. Did I mention perfect? I usually rant on and on about a film, but this one speaks for itself.In 1977 I stood in line for an hour to see the phenomenon movie that would change the art of films forever. When the lights dimmed, those trademark credits rolled, and Williams' score belted out those now infamous chords, I got goosebumps. I was only eleven, but I knew that somehow, this movie called Star Wars would be different. Today, I got those goosebumps back. Pride is not a Jedi quality, but for you, Mr. Lucas, an exception will surely be made.Bravo!!",10,3,9,21 May 2005
