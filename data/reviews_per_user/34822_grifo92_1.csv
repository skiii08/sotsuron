Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," brilliant film captures show greatly
",hey just got to see this tonight but have always been watching the ali g show and borat television program here in the uk i've never seen a audience react so brilliantly to a film especially a comedy there are some great hilarious moments and some kind of sick ugh moments but it all makes up for a great two hour journey around the us and a and if you don't think the ending is funny then you have a strange sense pamela running from borat after he tried to kidnap her after she rejected him is so classic 10/10 trust me a must see for comedy and well it shows how we can laugh at ourselves brilliantly hilarious film i recommend it to all.,10,1,21,8 November 2006
