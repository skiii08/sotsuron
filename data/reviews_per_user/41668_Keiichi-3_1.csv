The Blair Witch Project," The most cliche movie to hit the screens.
","While a lot of people think this is very original, this is HARDLY original in my opinion.  This movie is pretty much another view of that one UPN special about the Aliens abducting a family from their home while the kid was video taping it.  The ending, in and of itself was pretty much a complete RIP of how that UPN special ended on the taper's view.  I was not really scared and the stupidity of the people is almost classic George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, basically no cooperation and no real planning, especially for a student documentary.",Null,0,1,2 August 1999
