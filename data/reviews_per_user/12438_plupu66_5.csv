Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The film confuses vulgarity with comedy
","The premise of the movie was very generous: poking fun at cultural differences between USA and other parts of the world. A lot of the topics the movie touched on (American 'scholars' aka frat party loving freshmen, the righteous red neck right wing, the religious wackos etc...) were easy targets and rich sources of comedy. Unfortunately, the odd funny bit is buried in loads of vulgarity of all kinds from promiscuous more-than-innuendos to excrement to disgusting exhibitionism. As a matter of fact what disappoints me the most is not that someone made a movie of this base nature but the fact that there are so many people who find it amusing. This film pretends to challenge prejudice, taboos and conformism. It actually forgoes the most elementary principles of decency. As artistic value is nil. Are we going to see a sequel? Here are some ideas in the same league of fun and subtlety : a drunk peeing in a church, a junkie killing his mother, a boy being castrated just for fun. Is it still going to amuse and arouse the crowds?",3,8,17,7 November 2006
Up," Starts from an interesting idea but...
","The premise of the film is excellent - we all dream about embarking on the adventures of our lives. The first 20-30 minutes of the film are intriguing and not at all predictable. They introduce the characters - quite lovable - and raise one's expectations. Unfortunately, the film 'degenerates' in the usual cartoonish thrills with good guys fighting bad guys on the edge of a cliff or last minute (very predictable) rescues. This run-of-the-mill Disney/Hollywood action is only interrupted towards the end when the film remembers that it has an idea and that it needs to convey a message. It reveals what our true 'lives adventures' are; this part and the beginning of the film earned the 7 stars from me. Well, I guess Pixar needed to include all the cutesy stuff and the nail-biters to make the millions at the box-office. Too bad.",7,1,2,17 January 2010
Inception," Amazing Special Effects
","Based on reviews I was hoping this was a 'different' American film in the sense that it will have substance, subtlety and that it will make me think. It did not, it did not and it did not again. It is your typical Hollywood flick with car chases, shooting galore, explosions, fistfights, pretty boys and girls - the whole nine yards to sell tickets to the ADHD generation of teenagers. I gave it 3 stars - instead of just 2 - because the special effects are absolutely astonishing. This film wishes to be clever but really is not and does not make a lot of sense either. It reminded me of the teachers/professors who were confusing on purpose in order to make us believe they are smarter than we were.",3,7,10,4 June 2011
Parasite," One of the best I have seen in a long time
","This film is a powerful parable. If you like straightforward Hollywood films - with good guys and bed guys and an obviously predictable plot - DON'T see this film. It will leave you confused, even annoyed.
If, on the other hand, you want to see a film that will make you think and reevaluate your view on modern human society, it is a must see for you.",10,18,28,27 October 2019
Casino Royale," Adults liked this film?
","I could not believe that so many adults could give more than 2 stars to this film. It does not have a plot. The action is not believable even by a long stretch of imagination. The actors and actresses apart from showing muscle and breasts respectively are not able to show anything else. The kind of big money such a film makes is only proof of the very low IQ of may movie-goers. It is sad how Hollywood and comp manages to brain-wash and brain-damage its public. A bunch of sadistic terrorists, some exploding cars and a half dozen pairs of well-filled bras fill the pockets of a movie industry lacking imagination, soul and most of all, morals The entire film is an insult to a thinking person's intelligence.",1,9,15,3 October 2009
