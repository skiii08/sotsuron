Blade Runner 2049," Had a hard act to follow, but, still good
","It's good, but not great. A little convoluted and gets a little too tricky with assumptions and suspension of disbelief, but its worth a 7 out of 10. This is a case of a movie that could never live up to the original, due to the great effects that were made for the original and its dated time frame. it's a practical impossibility to follow up a classic, thus an impossible act to follow. However, it is definitely worthy to call itself a good sequel. In my mind. Very very rarely, is a sequel equal to the original. Examples are the Godfather part 2, and, coincidentally, a sci fi film starring Harrison Ford The Empire Strikes back, can be said to be better than the original. Ryan Gosling is somewhat wooden in this role. I get that he is essentially portraying an android, but a more inspired actor could have done something better with it. It was a treat seeing Edward James Olmos ,though you have to wish for something more than an extended cameo. Overall though, it's definitely worth the watch, and I highly recommend it.",7,2,5,13 January 2018
Darkest Hour," Good, but not great
","Probably the closest we have ever had to a near physical resemblence to Churchill. Oldman had the mannerisms down, but his tone of voice wasn't even close, and his Churchill accent attempt was a complete failure. Should little pithy statements that are not part of historical record have been added in? The answer is no.. If you are going for historical accuracy, as you cannot help but having to do here in historical record areas, then BE accurate The historical material is dramatic enough, without messing with history in some areas. That being said, it was entertaining enough. Is it an Oscar winning role for Oldman? No, for the reasons already mentioned. To me, it was a better time waster than most of the usual garbage that's out there. But its not the Tour de Force people seem to think it is. Its worth a seven out of ten, but that's about it.",7,0,3,25 February 2018
Passengers," Sci Fi too much of a given, but good romantic drama and suspense
","I am a sci fi fan, but But more on the Fantasy end of the spectrum. But this does require a lot of acceptance on the science advancement end. But as far as sci fi romance end, which is a pretty small group, I put it in the top 4 all time The big question among reviewers on this site, is why the bad reviews by the main critics? The answer is quite simple. You are putting in a formulaic sci fi plot,of early hibernation wake-up, plus equally formulaic 'we were thrown together' love story. Then add in the hot actors and slick production and suspense, and you are reaching for a blockbuster. Critics don't like to be reached for. For me, however, its about well rounded characters, human motivation, and production quality, before I even want to go into the science end. This delivers all that, and does it by combining the plot values I mention above in a successful attempt to make something new. Lets face it folks, this isn't rocket science, or even star-ship science. Its entertainment on a high quality level on all fronts. Is it great? No. Is it very good? Heck yes. Very worth the watch. To me, the movies are about entertainment, and if you learn something, that's a bonus. But if you want your intelligence massaged, get out of the reviewing business, and leave the movies where they were meant to be. Which is the hands of the audience who wants solid entertainment.",8,0,0,26 April 2017
The Lost City of Z," You cant just rewrite history
","What Nina Fawcett gives at the end is absolutely ridiculous. You CANNOT rewrite history. It leads the audience to believe that Fawcett actually found Z. For the sake of cinema, you can have some license by excluding certain factors. These include Jack's friend Raleigh Rimell, who's health was a drag on the final expedition trip. You can even downplay Fawcett's pre-expedition's career. But you cant try to blur the lines between history and reality. Especially at the end. It's unforgivable. That being said, the acting was excellent on all fronts, with the exception of maybe Sienna Miller as Nina Fawcett at the end. Her portrayal of a now delusional wife, was a little off kilter.The cinematography was great.But what she hands to the man at the end never happened, period. Is it worth the watch? Only if you don't care if the story is correct.",5,0,0,31 August 2017
Split," Highly recommended, and hopefully with more to come
","This is M. Night Shyamalan's best film since the sixth sense. The acting is superb. James McAvoy gives the best acting performance I have seen for several years. Anya Taylor-Joy also gives an incredible performance of a damaged yet strong young teen. The exploration of multiple personality disorder as villain is obviously controversial, considering the times that we live in and the stigma of mental illness. However, we need to look beyond that, as it advances the plot of a great film. If you are overly sensitive to these issues, then this film is not for you. The end of this film offers a different kind of twist than we are used to from Shyamalan. Its only slightly startling, but hopefully it will bring another movie to establish what I think is a long delayed connection.",9,0,5,9 June 2017
Jackie," Was good to start, but not the end
","It seemed to roll well on a historic inside angle, but the ending dropped it a point. History wanted to martyr Kennedy, but as time rolls on, we will see his presidency starkly in terms of only 2 years and 10 months. The assassination only served to give the media an excuse to deify, and cast him in a King Arthur role, and this movie still tries to do the same. Natalie Portman gave a surprisingly good performance, but the ending did a disservice to her portrayal by pandering to a propaganda myth. Is it worth the watch? Yes, if only for seeing Portman pull off the seeming impossible in her portrayal. But unless you like to be preached to, ignore the ending or turn off the video.",7,0,0,2 June 2017
The Adjustment Bureau," Very rare, good sci fi and love story in one.
","I have only seen two other good sci fi films, that have combined sci fi with a love story. This is the best Sci Fi love story movie, since Somewhere in Time. And it enters the top 4 of the best love stories I have seen on film. Great acting, great story premise, by a master sci-fi writer. I have only gave this rating once before in the last ten years to a movie. And it has been several years since the last one. But because of the story, original premise, and great acting, I give this a Ten of Ten. I don't know how I missed seeing this when it came out. I just wish more of what I see today, came anywhere within 75 percent of this.",10,1,3,11 August 2016
Snowden," Motivations can make villains, as well as heroes
","When you watch an Oliver Stone flick, you get his slant, and not real history. The personal reasons of the subject are not the issue here. I give this a grudging 7 of 10, based upon a good illustration of the protagonist's motivations. But so far, history has shown, no benefit was derived from his actions, and far more damage to people's lives. Stone leaves out the damage done to peoples lives that resulted from Snowden's actions. All of history is full of patriots and tyrants who have had Snowden's motivations. In this case, he failed. Snowden wasn't a tyrant, but he certainly was a villain. The individual lives he damaged are unredeemed. And all the government had to do, was just write some different programs and change placement of assets, and discard painfully physical as well as mental damage to the human assets. Very sad. Why do smart liberal people think their outcome will be positive, when all that is certain is the damage? To me, hurting people because of a very slim chance of a positive outcome is morally repugnant. But once again, morals have little to do with the actions of men like Snowden.",7,1,4,23 January 2017
The Shape of Water," A too predictable heart tugger
","Guillermo del Toro is known for the weird and his style. But this thing, if you want to call it a movie, barely rates a 6 for me.The acting is excellent, and has good production values, but that's pretty much it. The story is too predictable. The black lagoon creature is sympathetic, but barely so. The love story is hard to accept on suspension of disbelief, as well as the idea that the portrayal of government ineptness on this scale. And anyone who couldn't predict the outcome would have to be seriously stupid. Its as if del Toro decided he wanted to do a darker version of the Tom Hanks, Daryl Hannah 'Splash' movie from 30 plus years ago. It's watchable but fair at best. And thats the best that can be said for it.",6,22,43,22 February 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Same Kong, but maybe a different future
","What elevated this for me from a seven to an eight for, was that at the end of the final credits, we had a scene that leads you to believe there will be a sequel. And not the standard sequel that would normally follow the island chapter of King Kong. Overall, this Kong is the same formula as all the Kongs, with only cosmetic changes in motivations, Villagers, visitors, beastly antagonists, island, the same large monkey. There were tweaks, with a military aspect on the island, as well as a castaway, that helped to broaden its framework. Ever sine 76, we have had Kong remakes that have accelerated and condensed into smaller and smaller time frames between Kongs. I don't get this. Is Hollywood really that stupid? Maybe. But this time, there is at least a hope for something different in the future. If you keep remaking the wheel, its going to go flat eventually. If what I see is true, then there are possibilities here. The acting was good as you would expect from a block-buster. Huddleston was good, as was Larson and Jackson. and Goodman was as good as he usually is, this time with less to flesh out his character as well. The flick is worth the watch. Lets hope the sequels don't disappoint.",8,0,0,18 July 2017
Arrival," Entertaining but not great
","Very good, its entertaining. Its not the Tour de Force I expected from reviews, but excellent in presenting a different idea or alternative way of living. I give it a 7 of 10 instead of higher, because its too disconnected in its resolution as far as the protagonist is concerned. And its too big of a reach. What she remembers is the issue here. The malleability of time, is what downgrades this a few notches. It leaves way too much to be desired. Adans, Renner, and Whittaker put forward some very good acting. The effects themselves though, are more believable than the premise. Sci fi has been somewhat dumbed down over recent decades. But this one meets the criteria of making you think. Which is what has always been a sign of a good movie to me, sci fi or not.",5,0,5,3 February 2017
Life," Same story, but its alright
","Life is okay for a good thrill ride, but that's pretty much it. The problem here is not the action or the visuals, but rather derivative story line that hadn't been told too many times to count. This can only hurt the SF genre. Continuing this type of story line, will actually have many believe that space Sci Fi is just about this plot. Except for Star Wars, or maybe Guardians of the Galaxy. Many will stop coming to theaters to pay, on this principal alone for the alien on ship plot. This movie may be a sign of this, as it was clearly a bomb to end all bombs at the box office, and missed its cost to make by a large margin. It was a good movie and worth the watch if you have nothing better to do, but beyond that, you really cant say much.",7,2,4,2 August 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Disappointing sequel, but its alright
","This one tries to keep a connection with the first installment, but it kind of fails. Truth to tell, the first one should have been a stand alone. The whole secret society thing got old, midway through the picture. The elaborate weirdness seriously tests your suspension of disbelief. Especially near the end. Two thirds through, the plot begins to meander as well. Did this need two hours? It could have been edited to cut 15 minutes to a half hour, and not lost anything of value to the film. Reeves seems to improve as an actor with every film. He's almost shed the valley boy accent. I say almost. But I give him credit, even at age 52, for it taking so long. Laurence Fishburne was waaaay over the top, and needed better directing, as well as Claudia Gerini for being well, too wooden. You get the feeling she is a native Italian language actress, and had trouble translating feeling into English. Is it worth the watch? Yeah, I guess so. But if you were expecting the same quality as the first, you will be disappointed.",6,1,2,6 July 2017
Annihilation," Its a knock knock, but nobody is home kind of movie.
","This thing stretched credulity a little too much as to how the authorities would react to the main event in this piece. Too many things are left unexplained, and are left to the imagination. It started that trend when one of the characters somehow gets from point A to point B without explanation. It's an okay sci fi piece, but we do want our sci fi to be understood on some level. It starts to explain the phenomenon as the movie proceeds. Then it goes off on a senseless horror imagery tangent. Finally it ends on some kind of existential take on the question of who and what we are. And though we sometimes like movies that make you think, the movie itself failed to be entertaining enough to provoke such thought. The acting was superb and Portman, was well, Portman. Its about a 6 of 10. Is it worth the watch? Maybe as a time waster, but that's about all.",6,0,1,5 June 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," A Tour de Force, a must see
","Mel Gibson astounds with this, the best movie he has ever made. A true story that pulls no punches, and has more upfront carnage than any war movie I have ever seen. But it doesn't lose sight of the story of this incredible man, who attains the highest honor, without abrogating his values. Most critics who are obviously agnostic or atheist, seem to want to obsess on the main characters religious values. Meanwhile,you don't even see them as being relevant to the story at all. The only ones that seem to see such a focus is these critics themselves. I didn't see anything overtly religious, till I read some reviews after watching the movie. The acting was also sterling on all fronts. You cant miss seeing this movie.",10,7,11,5 July 2017
Alien: Covenant," Entertaining enough
","Not bad for its genre, which is lets fight the alien, and prevent it from infecting others. Sci fi as an overall genre is improving on the screen, but only on the small screen. Stereotypes in any genre, as anyone can see, sooner or later cripples that genre. Fortunately, recent offerings are showing that the immense amount of material out there is beginning to be looked at a little more seriously. That said, I don't get why this film was so denigrated. It simply picks up where Prometheus left off. As the old saying goes, you cant squeeze blood out of a sows ear. Alien's pretty has pretty much exhausted its subject matter. Its a little predictable at the end, as the attempted twist failed for a more discerning viewer. its entertaining enough as action sci-fi and worth the watch at 7 out of 10. It's a good time waster, and worth the watch.",7,5,7,23 August 2017
