The King's Speech," The King's Speech
","Tom Hooper directs an ace of a film driven at the helm by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Both men appeared to flawlessly represent the friendship of King George VI and Lionel Logue.All I can really say is I was taken away by specific scenes involving King George's internal struggle with self-confidence and his external struggles about actually being a king. I praise many scenes from the movie, but the one where Firth is all dressed as the King coming back from an unsuccessful speech is really memorable to me. He comes back to his family disappointed and concerned for his future. And as he appears in front of his two daughters he stands internally upset about his stammer and the well-being of his family. Then, one of the two daughters says 'Your Majesty', in awe of her father's newly decorated uniform. The unbelievable pressure of what King George went through is seen and quite evident. Firth plays the troubled heir to the throne to a tee. The emotions on his face could explain the situations at hand easily and without overacting. And when Firth and Rush are on screen, their presence is at times overwhelming. This is also a great turn for Helena Bonham Carter, who too, did a fantastic job as King George's lover, and friend.The story itself is very interesting and was portrayed well on screen. Watch out 2011 Oscars, there are some sweet performances heading your way.",8,1,2,30 December 2010
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," First Great Video Game Based Movie
","I went in thinking that 'Prince of Persia' would not be so fantastic-- thinking it would be one of those poorly done video game movies that collect dust and become forgotten (like The Mario Bros Movie and Resident Evil). But with a cast with Jake Gyllenhal and Gemma Arterton, I was hopeful. And both actors did not disappoint. The story also remained fairly faithful to the original game, which also for me, made the movie more enjoyable. But with the parts they did change they executed well and I was still happy. Overall it was a job well done.The moments of time travel with the dagger are done beautifully and masterfully. And the acting overall is strong.The future for video game-based movies look promising and I hope they all follow in the footsteps of 'Prince of Perisa'. Two thumbs up for Mike Newell.",7,3,6,2 June 2010
The Irishman," Scorsese Recyclable
","I wouldn't call the gangster/mob genre one of my favorites. The genre certainly is one of the most respected and has a place in film history, thanks in particular to the three leads here and Scorsese, but was there really a need for this?I've always respected Scorsese's work even if he isn't one of my favorites. His films have hit the whole spectrum for me from 2/3's all the way to a 9 (no perfect scores IMO), but for the most part has made his fascination with gangster films clear. With 'The Irishman' we can tell how much Scorsese loves the mob genre and this film is like an ode, and a slow-ugly reflection of this director's past and views on violence and the vast array of characters he has brought to the screen. Has old age changed Scorsese? It seems like many of their craft, he has gained wisdom and particular nuance to what we have seen time and time again on the big screen. We've seen the quiet but dutiful hitman take out person after person with no remorse (although in this there is something even more cold about it), and we've seen biopics that show the smorgasbord of events that changed history forever. Here we see examples of both-nothing to write home about, but they are here. Particularly the former, when we get some sort of payoff toward the final act, and see the main character reach for forgiveness in what he's done (another Scorsese trademark).Potentially the best part of any of his films is his fascination with forgiveness, redemption, salvation and religious purpose with his main characters and it is probably the only highlight in 'The Irishman'. At what cost did Sheehan's actions pay off? What did his daughters think? Where did he and his friends end up? What was he made to do against his own personal desires? But then, there isn't enough focused on this part. If Scorsese had stuck this part of the character arc out, the film would have been much better off.Now the acting. There is the trifecta here everyone is talking about. The three old men turn in ok performances, in particular Joe Pesci who has a subtle sophistication and menace to his character that harkens back to his roles in 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino'. Al Pacino is manic, flawed and energetic as Hoffa, while DeNiro is honestly the weak link as the lead role the title of the film suggests. Overall nothing new, and nothing great.Downsides of this film would be the 3.5 hour runtime (although length didn't actually bother me). I would imagine that it turns most people off to invest that much time, but they most likely will with the names attached to this production. My other critique would be the pacing of the final act as I felt it was rushed (believe it or not). I wanted to see more of Frank's struggle with redemption as that became the most powerful part of the film (Catholic guilt and forgiveness, etc.). The acting is meh, and there isn't much behind the direction except for the competency of making a movie. Once again (my unpopular opinion) that Scorsese doesn't offer much and that his past success makes him an overrated household name. Oh, and that CGI on Bobby D? Pretty bad. No way he can sell the physicality of a spry 30-something even with the attempt of changing how his face looks.",3,10,22,30 November 2019
127 Hours," Mostly 'eh' with great sound editing
","The highlight of 127 Hours is that certain scene I think has most folks intrigued to see this. Until then, it's a slow-burn kinda-deal with Franco on center stage.The score is intriguing, but what really got me was the use of sound to relay the emotion of Franco in almost every moment of the film. Those who do not like painful and bloody messes should be aware, for I had a hard time watching the awaited scene with his arm. But then again everyone in the theater cringed when it all happened, so I wasn't the only one.See it if you dig Danny Boyle and especially if you're a Franco fan, even though I think the film lacks many qualities of a great film. 127 Hours is possibly Franco's best performance so far, maybe with the exception of Freaks and Geeks.",5,1,3,4 December 2010
The Town," Gun Shots And Flower Pots
","A lot of people give Ben Affleck a lot of hate for his work. For his acting, it is totally justified, but for his directing it is quite the opposite. I went in seeing The Town expecting a not so great film because I have not seen too many Ben Affleck features. However, I still gave the movie a chance.To my surprise, I liked it. The cast is pretty stellar with the likes of Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner, and Affleck himself. The two worlds of good and bad are depicted clearly, as Affleck rides the fence separating the two. But also to my surprise, Pete Postlethwaite has a medium-sized role as the twisted flower shop owner which in itself blew me away. He shows so much frailty yet summons so much intimidation with a single look. Absolutely fantastic.Toward the end a memorable action seen ensues to finish the movie off with a bang.I have no idea what anybody else was saying when the said Ben Affleck couldn't write nor direct.Rest in Peace Mr. Postlethwaite. Thanks for another memorable role. Cheers!",6,0,1,12 January 2011
Watchmen," A Question of Humanity
","It's been well over 7 years since the release of 'Watchmen' in movie theaters, and as I write this I'm thinking of all the graphic novel and comic book adaptions that have been made in recent years and which ones truly stand above the rest. Of course, there is then the argument of DC's content vs Marvel's, and sure, there will always be devoted individuals who will stick with their preferred company and writers, but some stories are just better than others. Straight up. I had the privilege of finding the time to get a ticket and see the film on opening weekend, and I'm really glad I did. After watching it the first go around I was surprised how close to the material the adaption stayed, usually a path directors and screenwriters don't walk down frequently, but you can tell the love that Snyder has for the material; how scene after scene there are frames that match the graphic novel to a tee, and nearly every line verbatim. Amazing stuff. After perusing through the 'Watchmen' IMDb page I realize pretty much everything has already been said, but I figure what the hell. On the re-watch and after reading the graphic novel an additional two times over the span of 7 years I have come to appreciate the material even more. The coolest thing about the Watchmen, and really the highest quality, is the varying dynamic and character philosophies that make each character fit so well into the grand scheme of the film's (and graphic novel's) message. It truly struck me how the 'give-no-mercy', no compromise morality of Rorschach and the leveling-the-playing field, ultimate compromise mentality of Ozymandias makes you think beyond the one dimensional good vs evil. So many arguments can be made for both sides, and we leave the film asking and pondering, 'Wait, what? Who's right? Did he really get away with that? Did he really save more lives by killing others in the process?' It's like picking the lesser of two evils and this story and its characters (whether in the film or novel format) makes you think, and I effing love that about the 'Watchmen.' It is one of the ultimate dilemmas of humanity--one of the greatest philosophical questions... Just like the old situation goes: You are working at a rail yard. A train is coming in, but you notice there are people ahead working on the track and they don't know the train is coming. On the second track there is one person working and they don't know the train is coming either. The train is coming in way too fast and can't stop. What can you do? No one else is paying attention and you're the only one close enough to the control switch. Do you let the train continue and take the chance with the group working at one end? Or do you divert the train to where the one man is working so less lives are lost? It may seem like an easy answer at first, but there's a lot of content there. I assure you. And as if that isn't enough the allegory and allusion is brimming too. All thanks to the genius of Moore.Of course, the film misses pretty much all the scenes between the young kid Bernard, and the Newsie old guy Bernard and everything about the Black Freighter, and the plot is slightly altered (which slightly changes the end), but ultimately the message still gets across, and I applaud Snyder and the writers for doing that well. Because in most cases films lose out on the changes that are made, and many loyalists to the original material can never forgive that, but in the case of the 'Watchmen' I think it can be forgiven since so many other things are done incredibly well.I don't know if I'm getting more lenient as I grow older, but the 'Watchmen' jumps from a 8-star rating to a 10--strictly for having excellent story and character study while not giving up on style and original material. A movie that makes you think is always a keeper. I can understand Alan Moore's hate toward adapting written material to film, but I hope one day he can appreciate the same love Snyder has for something he created. It's a job well done, slight changes and all.",9,1,4,20 December 2016
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Certainly Overhyped and Not Great but Also Not Trash
","Heard all the great reviews on this, got excited to see it, and was majorly disappointed. The animation was different and I can certainly appreciate how it reminded me of stop-motion (it is also super colorful), but it gets blurry and weird at times, and I'm not exactly sure what this accomplishes.I am glad to see King Pin as the villain, and I'll be honest I'm not totally up to date with the Miles Morales story arc, but none of that is what made the film disappointing. As already mentioned, the animation is overhyped (colors are pretty and some sequences are well made), but if we are honestly talking about best animation ever... there are at least half a dozen movies made in the last decade that would surpass this IMO (Kubo and the Two Strings probably being the best).Then, the story falls flat and I never felt like there was anything at stake. The universe gets mixed up and Miles is just trying to find his courage in being a hero. Nothing ever feels dire. Most of the comedy falls flat except for some good jokes being made at passed Spider-Man movies and Peter Parker. Far from the best animation ever as most are dubbing it and also far from being awful. I'll probably be one of the few reviews that sits middle of the road.",5,1,1,12 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," QT's Weakest Entry, but a Well-Made Film Nonetheless
","Brad Pitt HAWT.In all seriousness though, he's very easy to look at and hands in a great performance especially leaning on his comedic chops during those final 20 min. All-in-all I enjoyed QT's love letter to the industry and a bygone era, but also, that's all it is. Its strengths are also its massive weaknesses ultimately crippling and interfering with the storyline. Editing didn't feel great either and that leaves us with a film that basks in it's polished late-60's era a bit too much and never truly delivers any statement beyond remarking on the time.I do love QT's passion for the Western. And scenes with Leo's Rick Dalton acting are some of the best scenes in the film.Also, I loved seeing some hippies get what they deserved!Potentially QT's weakest entry.",7,0,0,9 February 2020
Drive," Loses appeal as the years go on.
","As a young adult, very much into artsy things and low-key films, I remember the day a few of my friends and I were deciding to go see the recent remake of Straw Dogs and I convinced them to go see Drive instead-which none of them had heard of. Not totally knowing what to expect myself we were entertained mildly until the scenes at the motel and the elevator. If you've seen Drive, it is needless to say why. After the watch, it was all we could talk about, especially how great Gosling was in his role-a role certainly made for him due to the lack of speaking and physical language.On a rewatch as an adult, those scenes that put us over the top into loving this film certainly make less of an impact now, but the message concerning Gosling's 'drive' and what it means for a family to have a man who can protect them still stand. As do the more simpler compliments about the Refn's style and directorial choices.The subtle yet hypnotic 80's retro soundtrack pulls you into a different world that screams cool (possibly a smidge too much). Even the unique retro feel of the hot pink credits add to this art-house vibe we are being induced with.It isn't much, but I think Refn does a credible job tying in character 'drive' with the main plot of the story and conducts a wonderfully artsy show-offy film (whatever that means!). Carey Mulligan is adorable and plays a woman in a hard place. Bryan Cranston plays a poor, sleezy mechanic who aids Gosling's character. The whole thing is relatively low-key, until those certain scenes I already mentioned pop out you in the ways they are meant to. The greatest compliments for this film go to how Gosling's character harkens back to the golden age of cinema and how the tense romance (between Gosling and Mulligan) is the spark that lights up his meter of tension to do the right thing (in the sense to protect this vulnerable family).In other words, I think Gosling's character goes down in the same category as Travis Bickle in Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver'; a great antithesis/antihero. As I already mentioned, the way Gosling's character shines in Drive is reminiscent to the mysterious desperado from when the greats of the golden-era of Hollywood reigned (i.e. Gary Cooper, John Wayne, Charles Bronson, William Holden, Clint Eastwood, etc.), which we do not get wnough of these days.A film I initially gave a 10/10 has moved down to about an 8.5-9/10 for the appeal it has lacked for me ever since that initial viewing. Dare I say, it was something I overhyped? Possibly, but still worth the watch.",9,12,25,16 September 2011
Midsommar," Great Horror w/ Fantastic Lead Performance
","Ari Aster follows up his debut film 'Hereditary' with more nuance and distinction to his direction style shot directly into the veins of this slow-burn horror. Lead by a rather stunning performance by Florence Pugh, 'Midsommar' finds a college girl named Dani (after stricken with a real-life nightmare) going to Sweden with her boyfriend's entourage. Then things begin to get strange and truly bizarre. The brilliance of having a true horror film take place where the sun is up 20 hours in the day can't go without saying as it makes the dark moments even more surreal and nightmarish. Throw in the characters' experimentation with whatever drugs come across their path and you have a deadly concoction. That May Queen dance is something else.",9,3,9,17 January 2020
Reservoir Dogs," I don't tip.
","Great cast. Great Acting. Great Dialog. Quentin Tarantino's directing debut is riveting. I was drawn into the movie watching the characters unfold through the dialog. 'Reservoir Dogs' is the spark; the whining newborn cry of a director's legendary career.A simple jewelry heist goes wrong and develops into the hard, opposing views and beliefs of the stumped robbers within the party. Mr. White and Mr. Pink discuss the possibilities... Mr. Blonde is a lunatic... and Mr. Orange is dying in a puddle of blood on the floor... Mr. Brown, dead... and Mr. Blue seemingly missing or killed during the robbery... The intensity of the robbery is great and we don't even see the actual thing.One of the men within the group is a cop... and these robbers hate the sight of any man with a badge who is out to take them to jail. The torture scenes with the cop truly got to me and were at first difficult to watch. Mostly the pure casualness of Mr. Blonde single-handedly made these scenes appear even more brutish. Through their botched up events, the surviving members of the group try to discuss how such a simple robbery could go so wrong.And underlying everything else there is a complexity of trust, loyalty, and friendship we see develop between Mr. White and Mr. Orange.I think Steve Buscemi wins as best actor in the ensemble but a case can be made for each actor. Reservoir Dogs has got memorable scenes, memorable quotes and a great story. Sure Tarantino has a bit of an ego but that doesn't mean his movies stink. My favorite from Tarantino, and probably one of the strongest debuts for any director.",9,1,2,24 January 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," Western Values
","James Stewart, The Legend.How does one begin to describe those moments when a scene of a film just captures you; moves your soul into a realm of emotion you weren't remotely near the hour before? I'm not sure myself, but this film nails it.Even if most see Stewart as the bumbling nice guy (and find it annoying) one must admit this role was made for the guy. And to also note that this was his first role after the war--and to top that off his first intimate scene he partakes in with the beautiful, lovely Donna Reed is a complete showstopper. Seriously, the only prop is a phone and just reading the desire on Reed's face and watching Stewart change from stand-offish to surrendering to his own deep desires, is something I can say is rarely achieved. Capra & Co., I say again, you nailed it!The crazy thing about watching 'It's A Wonderful Life in the 21st Century is that we can certainly comment on how times have changed for better or for worse, and concerning public discourse and general values, I think mostly for the worse.'It's A Wonderful Life' is definitely a product of it's time, but it is much more than that in the sense of morality, mortality, and the influence of early 20th Century Western values that have been slowly stomped on and questioned over the years since. In today's world of nihilism and 'the end is nigh' and 'humans suck', I think most folks have lost sight of what good there is in living. Instead, we virtue signal and hate our neighbors while we should take a second to see we are more alike than we want to admit. This film has all of this presented in George Bailey's story; that he has sacrificed time after time his personal wants in the sake of helping others (great moral compass), and also proving (unbeknownst to him) that he's greatly affecting everyone around him. So by the time he is looking back on his life and it isn't how he originally planned it out, he is deeply upset and sad, because well, who wouldn't be? Not everyone will ask God for help (as Bailey does) because we are all different and believe different things, but it takes some deep inner reflection for George to realize he's had it really good. There is not a better film out there that represents these values and helps us formulate the very same conclusions with our own lives. It is a vast understatement that our minds can not wrap themselves around how different things would be if we didn't meet or help the numerous amount of people we've come in contact with in our lives.At the core of this film is the solid, concrete foundation of Western Values that seems a lost concept to all the millennials my age who demand the ways of socialism, are secular, and statistically claim the future is dark and weary. A far cry from the message of George Bailey's revelation that he himself fights through the tears to see his friends and family gather around the Christmas tree at his home.In other aspects, take note, Henry Travers is one of the best character actors of his time, and his presence is always welcome on-screen. Usually playing the lovable-fatherly type. The stunning Donna Reed does a great job as George Bailey's wife. And last but not least, Lionel Barrymore, who perhaps plays one of the most vile characters to grace the silver screen, is perfectly cast in his role as Potter. When you put all the above together (amazing story, acting, production) what do you get? The winning formula for Frank Capra who is the mastermind to really give this world a movie that sincerely touches the heart in more ways than one.The whole scene toward the end pretty much had me in tears... and that's what a great movie's capabilities should be. Something that has you ask yourself questions and really make you think, 'Life IS worth living' or 'I really do effect everyone that knows me whether they recognize that or not.' And that's everything Capra's film did to me.I hope we never lose sight to the greater things in life; friends, family, love-while we are in a world buried in dirty politics, polarizing figures, partisan smear jobs, cynicism and hate because there are so few movies out there where you can walk away saying, 'I want to really live my life.'As the old man in the film says,
'Youth is wasted on the wrong people!'",10,1,4,5 January 2010
When Harry Met Sally...," When Harry Met Sally
","I don't watch too many romantic comedies, but this one was great. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan make for a interesting pair of 'friends' and throw plenty of play off of each other. The witty dialog and directing makes this movie all the better. So I'll give a big hand for Nora Ephron and Rob Reiner. And ya gotta love Bruno Kirby with Carrie Fisher! Great cast and great soundtrack! The warm feelings off of Louis's music is unmatchable.So many good things about this movie, but most everyone here has already said it all. I won't go on for much more, but I'll end on this note:If you're looking for a romantic comedy, this may be your cup o' tea!",8,1,1,1 December 2010
Joker," Another Great Phoenix Performance
","A well-made film by Todd Philips and Co. with a commanding and tragic performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The film gives us easy commentary on aspects of reality through the differences of social classes and the grasp on understanding mental illnesses. The main character, Joker, is the catalyst for the story and to tie it all together we get a very original take on the beginning of the comic-world's most notorious villain.IMO, Joaquin's best performance will always be Freddie Quell in The Master, but this is very good. It appears he may be on his way to getting his first Oscar.",7,2,3,9 February 2020
Whiplash," Well made regardless of accuracy
","Being a musician, this film resonated with me, and provided me with vivid flashbacks of feelings I endured when I was in band competitively trying to get the first chair horn parts in symphonic band. The strange thing is I have come across plenty of other individuals (who are also musicians) that hate this film, and I mean HATE this film because they feel this does not accurately showcase the music industry or musical process. I suppose it all depends on the experience. Of course, I was never treated to the extreme measures that Miles Teller character endures from Simmons' hardcore ways, but let me just say that it doesn't take much to feel the pressure, especially when you really want a part. But regardless of how realistic the film is or how it makes me feel, the film is well made. So in my opinion, 'Whiplash' is an awesome film.Miles Teller is on a crazy streak; doing some decent movies and putting in even better performances, but Whiplash definitely manifests his greatest effort thus far in his incredibly young career.J.K. Simmons hands in one of his finest roles, playing a mentor who taps the spirit of R. Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, and throws 'acting punches' when you think the film can't get any better. Immediately as the credits began to roll I knew he had the Oscar.The movie as a whole put me through a ride. My nerves were being toyed with as I watched Miles Teller's character share screen time with J.K. Simmons. The on screen chemistry is their and in full-bloom.And what puts the whole thing together? The grade A soundtrack that acts as the lifeblood.",10,1,3,6 December 2014
The Cannonball Run," Good Ole' Character Comedy
","'The Cannonball Run' is a very fun film. To start off, this film has a nice star-studded cast with the likes of Burt Reynolds, Dom Deluise, Farrah Fawcett, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, and my personal favorite Jack Elam-- who all constantly throw out laughs. Everyone is excellent in their unique and very eccentric roles. There are amazing comedic duos who are wildly out in their prime such as Reynolds & Deluise, Davis & Martin, Bradshaw & Tillis. Plus there are great amounts of eye candy between the like of Farrah Fawcett and Adrienns Barbeau. The fact that this film is also based off of a real race makes me want to have seen it all for myself. This is a very character-based comedy and is nothing compared to it's more well known ancestor 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'. However it still makes it's mark in the rat-race genre. I highly recommend Canonball Run to anybody who hasn't seen it. Take a risk and see how you like another classical and loopy take of cross-country greed and chance.",7,0,0,2 June 2010
Before Sunrise," Linklater, the Manipulator of the Everyday Moment
","Richard Linklater is a great director, and great directors are able to show their style with success, allowing movies to still become what they want to be but with that special 'touch' director's have. For Linklater, it's taking everyday moments and routine things and making them raw or magical. The fact that you can see something that could be so average in a different light means that he has indeed succeeded at what he planned on doing all along.'Before Sunrise' is the third film I have seen from his repertoire. One could say he has even changed the romantic drama genre with this film. The relationship that develops between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is truly mesmerizing and one of a kind. The thing is, I can see where some people may dislike this film. It focuses solely on their character attributes and what their beliefs are. There is also heavy focus on dialog. It may also seem like a true slow-burn kind of film to many, but I think it paces itself rather well. It is a true testament to character development and the loving relationship we all wish to have; the reason why many of us go to the movies, adoring the celebrity folk on screen, wishing we could sometimes fall in love with the real-life versions of the characters they play. The performances that Hawke and Delpy turn in are memorable and you can't help but feel a part of their conversation as the movie goes on.Linklater's sequel 'Before Sunset' does the entire story justice too. It is even more amazing how they made it work to such an open-ended conclusion to 'Before Sunrise.'",9,1,2,6 April 2011
The Truman Show," Good Afternoon, Good Evening, and Good Movie
","This film is inspiring and captivating. Jim Carrey pulls off the performance of his career and was ignored for an Oscar nod. Ed Harris does a believable job as a man playing 'God', and provides a very artistic air to his work as Christof. And Peter Weir leads both these men to act out a very touching and emotional story.One of the most amazing things about this film is the elegant and abnormal camera angles/techniques that were used. Through this the audience believes that they are watching the TV show Truman is unknowingly starring in.But most of all along with the excellent acting of Jim Carrey, the music really helped this film bring about its emotional core. The music really added another layer to the film's overall essence.All-in-all 'The Truman Show' is a story of exploration and desire--Wanting to be so much more than just normal, Truman wishes to be removed from his mundane activities and turn his dreams into a reality...",8,0,1,24 January 2010
