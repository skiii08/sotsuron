Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Every penny worth it ! once again !!
","After much speculation and expectation, one has to say Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr have together pulled it off once again with a crunchy screenplay and acting with at most ease. With Jude Law and Noomi Rapace bringing justice to their characters, Jared Harris proved to be the perfect foe for a super hero with no super powers. Screenplay was well written with enough wit; adding to the twists and turns unfolding one after the other. Action sequences even though are not breath taking, are loud enough to keep audience glued to their seats and a special mention for two the sequences, One when Holmes salvages Mr and Mrs. Watson and the other when Holmes and Watson run for their lives. Guy Ritchie, deserves all the accolades not just for being the captain of the ship but also for being smart enough to serve all the desserts cold to the audiences. As a screenplay writer Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney have saved the best for the melodrama, Game of Shadows has a stellar last 10 minutes which will not just grab all your attention but will make you forget all the logical flaws you noted or tried to note down during the previous 119 minutes. Robert Downey Jr as cool as ever; with Jude Law trying to match him frame by frame; with Noomi Raplace providing enough support to both of them; with Jared Harris proves to be their perfect demon, Game of shadows proved to be the one to watch out for.1 (Guy Ritchie) + 1 (Robert Downey Jr) + 1 (Jude Law) + 1 (Jared Harris) + 1 (Screenplay) + 1 (Wit and Fun) + 1 (Gladstone) + 1 (BGM) + 1 (Holmes - Moriarty Chess play) = 9/10",9,0,2,3 February 2012
