The Finest Hours," Excellent Film
","I have watched this film 3 times, and will watch it again and again. I love the whole wholesome and exciting story. The fact that it is based on a real life rescue is even more amazing to me. It is a good example of how the Coast Guard is a critical piece of our nation's defense and service. I don't know why it appeals to me so much, but it does. Maybe it is because I have my own Coast Guard story in my life. It is also a romantic movie--I enjoy the love story and how it enhances the rescue portion of the movie. The way it was filmed gave me chills and thrills when I wasn't expecting them. Great movie making, and I think it will be a classic eventually, even though the reviews were less than excellent. I know it is a classic for me!",10,2,4,27 October 2016
