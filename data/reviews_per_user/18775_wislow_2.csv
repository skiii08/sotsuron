The Blair Witch Project," AWFUL !!!!
","Unfortunately, I've seen it and it's a real terrible movie. It's a bad joke... It's really tedious. I don't understand how people can like it !",1,3,5,31 March 2000
The Green Mile," TERRIFIC
","You MUST see this beautiful movie : you'll love it !!! I've read the book and I liked it too much but the movie is better. (Usually it's better to read his books instead of seeing a movie). They didn't spoil the story as they usually do. The story is well-played, the cast is perfect.",8,0,0,25 March 2000
