Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Utter Bile!
","For once I have to agree with the critics. I truly say I feel the sorriest for all those people who waited 6 weeks out of Mann's Chinese Theatre, cause they surely must have felt like they had egg on their face after watching this nightmare. OK, question #1... Why was that planet being cut off from trade? Was this ever answered? Question #2... Why is Darth Maul only in this movie for upwards of 8 minutes while Jar Jar is in practically every scene? Question #3, why does Darth Maul's make up look so bad under the lights? Including those Rite Aid devil horns that you can see molded to his head? Makes no sense. I knew when they showed up on the desert planet it would be drawn out & boring (like Ep. IV) but to have ET in at as well?!? C'mon! The only redeeming quality of this film is the score and sound effects. Ok also the gungan people, asian accent bad guys & Ewan...but only for unintentional humor",Null,0,1,19 March 2000
