Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Looney & Disney
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is an Entertaining movie. My favorite parts are the parts with 'Daffy Duck' and 'Donald Duck' having a war, and 'Bugs Bunny' with 'Mickey Mouse'. If they make another 'Roger Rabbit' movie, I hope they make more 'Looney Tunes' and 'Disney' characters team up.",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
