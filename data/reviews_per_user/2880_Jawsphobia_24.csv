Angels & Demons," The Busy Baddie and the Atheist Fantasy Hero
","Faith is a gift he is 'yet to receive.' But Professor Robert Langdon has done instead is merely knelt before the Magdalene and and ridden a car backwards at high speed under someone's the Jedi reflexes. Like Professor Indiana Jones, he can wave the flag of the scientist no matter what plot machinations demonstrate before his own eyes. And the audience can disbelieve right along with him.One of the best story devices here is that the Vatican security office receives a live camera feed showing an anti-matter bomb that has 'artificial light' on it so to find its location throughout the movie they shut down power to each section of Vatican City, one by one. What's not determined is whether the artificial light is A/C or D/C like the explosive device itself running out of battery power, nor how long the power needs to be turned off in each case before it can be seen on the security monitor (long enough to hold one's breath?), nor who remains in the security office to observe this, nor how they plan to view the monitor should they get around to switching off the power to the security office.Meanwhile the mastermind behind this multi-layered crime had made great leaps of faith. Of COURSE you can find a trustworthy thug to transport an unstable experimental substance (which will not exist until moments before its theft) across the world and then stand on it patiently. Of COURSE even though you are using the real anti-matter bomb and have placed it where it can destroy something that you want, you have calculated the correct influence of cold on battery power and you know within a second when it will die and how far away it must be to survive a matter-anti-matter contact explosion. Of COURSE you can invite an academic into a crisis that threatens tourists of Rome and expect that he will respect the Vatican's decision to keep Roman police out of it for fear of 'world media attention.' Of COURSE he will wade through the seemingly doomed crowds with full knowledge of a time-bomb and simply tell no secular cops because he's just that kind of respectful guy. Of COURSE it is also quite worthwhile to arrange your set-piece killings according to a puzzle with clues any whip-smart symbologist can follow in time to help facilitate and witness your grand finale. And of COURSE it is worth killing the highest-ranking priests you can find when the afterlife and judgment are uppermost in your psyche.They say an adventure is only as good as the villain's plan. In this case it is full of more holes than Swiss Cheese on the CERN lunch cart. I admit while reading both Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I was turning the pages and feelin' smart since I knew and still know nothing about the Illuminati or secret societies and those books might either be a primer for a lot of us or the whole nut of our education on these matters. In book form, it was interesting as it unfolded. I fumed a bit about this or that, questioned some as a weather-beaten Catholic myself, but overall enjoyed the way plot points revealed themselves. I admit that the adaptation for the most part has likely made wise choices in omissions. One critic cited Langdon's joke from the book, 'Neutrinos have mass? I didn't even know they were Catholic.' But that glibness couldn't just be dropped into the life-and-death scenes that survive. Sometimes the time it takes to read a page rounds out an unlikely event that would be tough to take on screen. So I can't fault the adaptation and Ron Howard made as good a movie as can be made, but as a thriller trying to be just entertainment I don't think it will hold up to scrutiny. The entertainment value ends up being the tap-dance of Hollywood's nice guys Hanks and Howard in dealing with settings and issues that super-secular Hollywood holds in contempt. If you go to the movie interested in tracking that, then it's worth sitting through. But otherwise it will be all about why an unarmed scientist feels comfortable walking into dark abandoned buildings expecting to find a brilliant and powerful murderer.",Null,1,4,18 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Premise: Please lobby for a re-cut
","Star Wars was better off as an unfinished symphony.  The superficial elements are back, but more clean and sterile, deliberately splashed with cold water at every turn, child-proof and suspense-free.  Cut-aways to Jar Jar's antics or race track yackers diffuse tension and focus.  Though broad strokes can't be changed at this late date (like setting the film on Alderaan instead of Naboo, which would have given something new about something known instead of changing the subject), there are some cuts that could easily be made to make the film sit more easily on a shelf beside the Original Trilogy (which I love).  Immediately after Jar Jar is met in the woods and the Jedi clear frame, the scene should be cut.  Then the further chatting, the trip to Gungan City, and EVERY UNDERWATER SCENE should be deleted.  We do not have to explain how they got to the Castle, because we do not know the geography of Naboo and we know the Jedi can run in a blur. Now the rescue of Amidala will play without the stress and animosity we have built up from sitting with unwelcome Jar Jar.  Strangely, his presence as a background player will not be annoying now.  The battle in orbit could be re-edited so that it includes Qui-Gon's discussion of Tatooine, so the choice is made under fire and not in a lull of quiet which typifies Episode One as it is.  Then have R2 make the vital repair, they zoom off, and we immediately have the commendation scene - which will play better here. There are still a few cuts here and there, and the green pasture battlefield under a pretty blue sky should be cut as much as possible - especially Jar Jar, so the power of the dual can resonate through without dramatic speed bumps.  The final scenes could be shuffled as well death, funeral, congratulations from Palpatine, then final parade.  With all the Special Edition wackiness going on, it would not be asking too much to change this film for its life on DVD.  The Jar-Jar outtakes can be kept separate, so they can be viewed out of context where they won't do as much damage.",Null,0,1,17 August 2000
Kung Fu Panda," this movie coasts along
","The trailer was to the point and part of an excellent marketing campaign, but Kung Fu Panda is weak and seems to drift until two thirds in - about fifty minutes or so - where he actually begins training after the heavy is finally and implausibly unleashed.The opening Dreamworks logo and back story being in a different animation style was a good call, but from then onward the formula of starting production without a firm script proves to be a problem.The Panda is immediately out of his depth and granted a savior position thanks only to the loopy, illogical judgment of the top 'master.' From there on character change their defining positions whenever it suits the needs of the swiss cheese premise: secondary guru (Dustin Hoffman's voice, having to tolerate very functional and single-level dialog) decides now that the baddie is indeed escaped from prison the Panda is the 'only one' who can save them despite the previous demonstrations of skill from his team. What is this teaching kids, while we're at it? The one 'destined' to blunder into victory only needs a crash course in an art form others have dedicated their lives toward? The movie is getting positive exit polls or word of mouth presently thanks to a stronger third act that only then has a narrative that perhaps should have driven the film from the start: Baddie is on the way and it will take about as long for him to arrive at home base as it will take to whip the would-be hero into shape.Mind you I saw the film in pirated online form so the images were okay but I'm not glowing about the technical quality. All I'm looking at is the content and that is nowhere near up to the inspired level of most hit animated features these days.I'm sure the People's Republic of China is happy that the movie has an audience and that it ultimately has nothing to say beyond a bland fortune cookie.",Null,1,4,24 June 2008
Star Trek," Star Trek with a Death Star to destroy
","In the 1980's there was more cross-over than clash between fans of Star Trek and Star Wars as I recall. The last I saw of that rivalry was in the movie Fanboys which - though very entertaining - was given a release reserved for would-be sleeper hits and then it just never woke up. The verdict is pretty well in for Star Trek (2009) and a possible revival of interest in that brand, which would add insult to injury for Star Wars fans (who have had to endure their own prequels culminating in the animated Clone Wars and Jabba the Hutt's heretofore unheard of larvae son) except for the oft repeated term 'Star Wars-style reboot.' There is plenty of action and humor, without the long sequences of staring into a bright light or long drawn out space-dock departures with any floating of people or things from one place to the other miles away feeling like the trip must occur in real time. I think this is the first time I remember seeing a Star Trek shuttle travel quickly. Ebert nit-picked a few things I couldn't care less about. If you buy warp drive and you buy teleportation then it's not much of a leap to say that a beaming genius might figure out a formula for doing one during the other.",Null,1,5,18 May 2009
Memento," Yes, a story in reverse scene chronology can be fun.
","Take two actors from The Matrix, a great, original screenplay with a premise about a short-term-memory disorder, and a unique backward timeline and suddenly you can't go around claiming that movies have stopped innovating. This may have been done before, but this is the movie people will talk about.  Have you seen Memento?",Null,0,2,13 September 2000
Inglourious Basterds," Not for critics, but people who love a good movie
","Some critics might claim to need a code key to interpret what Tarantino means by this revisionist adventure film, but I'd say it's right under their up-turned noses: There's a great little scene where Mike Meyers plays a British military man who anticipates attacking a Nazi film premiere so he brings in an a film critic as an adviser. This may or may not be necessary but it does allow for a dialogue exchange like: Meyers: What do you do? Critic: I am a film critic.Meyers: What are your accomplishments? Even though the critic goes on to list some compilation books, it may as well be a rhetorical question.Tarantino thumbs his nose at convention and that is part of the movie's appeal. His movies are often about movies as much as they are about the content at hand. Yet he still manages to sustain genuine tension. The opening Nazi interrogation of a French farmer and a later a tavern basement guessing game scene must have had whopping page counts but they play out as chapters and remain engrossing high stakes set pieces. In the same film he can introduce a character by throwing a title onto the screen as if this member of the 'Basterds' was cool enough to have his own movie, or play a 1980's David Bowie song while a woman prepares to do battle in her own way while Nazi flags hang outside the window.The movie takes place in an alternate universe that could either be a dream or the unreality of the grind-house era Tarantino has celebrated in Kill Bill and, well, Grindhouse. Anyone with a brain will get that. If that sounds good, see it. I notice now there are blurbs about 'how Jewish critics feel' about the movie. Well, those who go to a movie with a deliberately misspelled title knowing it is a revisionist fantasy and can't bear to see the character of Hitler as the butt of the joke don't have an opinion worthy of note. If you are an expert on NASA, your views on George Lucas' Star Wars movies are not necessarily of use to me. In fact it's a little galling that such a critic-proof designation as 'Jewish critic' should be trotted out. They can say what they like about a sensitive document with the intentions of Schindler's List and God bless them. But if someone gets his boxers in a bunch over slapstick Nazis or clueless Hitler autographing the Grain Diary for Indiana Jones, then they just aren't going to be the right audience for Inglourious Basterds. In fact they shouldn't be watching fun movies at all. They should try staring at a blank wall and talking to themselves rather than type up their blather.But it's not all fun. Sad things do happen and unfortunate events occur in this movie. The tension even in dialogue does come from the danger of having a Nazi at the table or someone daring to ask him to leave. But when you get reviewers comparing the Basterds to Al Qaida I think we can excuse those critics from the table as well. Or call Eli Roth over to them and yell 'Play ball!'",Null,162,335,22 August 2009
Iron Man 2," skip the reviews; watch the movie
","Some people didn't like this movie. I basically avoid getting into a fight about it. But I have to be honest that while watching it I was as entertained by it as I was by the first Iron Man. This one may even be a bit more fun without the burden of an origin story. Some fans have been able to catalogue visual continuity flaws, and more power to them. I didn't notice any. I guess my eyes went where the editor expected they would.An ongoing pet peeve of mine is the ease with which critics publish falsehoods. I don't even mean subjective arguments with which I disagree, but unqualified statements contrary to the evidence on screen. Here is an example, having looked at a review of Iron Man 2 before seeing it, since I was thrown by a claim that caught my eye. Ordinarily I avoid reviews of movies I already intend to see.False statement number one is that Mickey Rourke doesn't have enough screen time. Fact: he has exactly the right amount of screen time for a primary movie heavy. Does he have as much as in The Wrestler? No. Does he have as much as Nicholson's Joker in the 1989 Batman? Of course not, because there was no writer's strike during the shooting of Iron Man 2 and Tim Burton doesn't always know when enough Jack is enough. Jack had way too much screen time in that flick, entertaining as he was.False statement number two is that we don't see Iron Man in the suit enough. This might actually be offered as proof the critic didn't even see the movie. We see as much of Iron Man in full costume as the story permits, which is exactly the right amount. Then we also get to see War Machine in his own similar costume, and Mickey again in something still similar. Not to mention the collection of Iron man suits on display in Stark's home. This of course is even clear to people who have seen the trailers. No spoilers here.I could go point for point through the whole 'review,' but those were the to most laughable that drifted into my thoughts as I was watching them be disproved during the film. Proof once again that a movie should be seen as cold as possible (despite the omni-present trailer) and there is no point having a critic's nonsense rattling around in your head.Let's face it, you are in better hands with the team behind Iron Man 2 than with even a competent critic. The themes are well explored, the character flaws of Stark are exploited for substance, and it is as it should be. I don't think I'll show up for any Stark parties or Expos, but I will keep showing up to his movies. If there's a quibble, it can be for the hurdles placed before the filmmakers by the studio when it announced the release date of this flick before telling its director - who then had to round out whatever draft of a script with an ongoing workshop with his cast. Let's hope they are given more time for part 3, but they managed to maintain the standard of the first one to a large extent.I may never have the time to compile an archive website of disprovable quotes from critics, and there is the danger anyway that it might inadvertently promote their names.",Null,1,2,16 October 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," more fun going there than getting there
","The Tim Burton signature style is in place and there is a lot of wit on display though not much laughter in the audience. This is likely as good a movie as could be made of Sweeney Todd, however. I was restless during the daughter/ward's light little song at the window and eager to see the partnership formulate between Barber and Cook, a moment which feels long in coming when it arrives. I miss the a few chorus bits from the play, including the title which puts one in the mind frame of opera and also the lyrics 'God that's good' although the scene and song associated with it remain. It seems they just made a choice to let individuals do the singing and eliminate any chorus. The movie is more about a kind of dark, giddy anticipation of fun nastiness until the tragedy of 'idiot plot' elements is revealed, what the late Gene Siskel used to call the questions that might reasonably have been asked which would have stopped the movie in its tracks. Despite the fact that the material both celebrates rage and revenge while at the same time preaching indirectly that it is married to indiscriminate evil. . . the film is diverting. It hasn't got the sweet or underdog core of Edward Scissorhands or Sleepy Hollow, but it is fun. If you hate musicals it may not turn you and it's not as kitchy fun as Grease or Little Shop; it's in the middle, slamming the elite while selling them tickets for years and giving them a close shave.",Null,1,5,25 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Seann William Scott as Han Solo
","Date Posted: 8:04am Subject: Seann William Scott as Han Solo                        A.C. Crispin has a trilogy books, Brian Daley had a trilogy.                        Plenty of material for six TV mini-series.
                       Seann William Scott (Road Trip, American Pie) would make a great young Han.                        As a secondary idea, I'd like to see The Emperor's Hand as a Myra Jade series.                        Has anyone seen The Dark Redemption online? It's a good chapter-film.                        What is the best way for us to campaign to Lucas? All he has to do is sit back and collect royalties. There are plenty of people who would adapt and direct this stuff, especially the Han Solo shows. I am quite sure Seann William Scott would love to play this character. My one extra hope is that it not be kiddie-proofed.                        As in Han Solo at Star's End, this would be a Han willing to send someone a gift-box with a face-clawing monster inside, and willing to send another villain through an air-lock.                        Please get behind me on this.                        George:                        Maybe show Han saving Chewie's family, maybe show the Sabbacc game where Han wins the Falcon from Lando Calrissian (which would also be fun to cast - who might be a good young Lando?)

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas is back on track
",Yes - a legitimate Star Wars film that will look good on your shelf right beside the Original Trilogy.  Every movie has quibbles.  The fitful sleep scene may not play as intended.  I didn't mind the love story - there is no such thing as a romance that isn't cheesy.  It all serves a purpose.  Just seeing Mace Windu and Yoda in action is worth it.

Top Secret!," Sheet Shootin' is a catchy tune
","The opening song which combines Beach Boys music with the subject of Skeet Shooting is worth the price of the movie and prepares you for the joyful insanity that will follow.  Kilmer is at his second best, after The Doors, with an Elvis Presley and Spy-Movie spoof.  This range of subject matter may account for the relatively low box office.  But when I hear the over-used title TOP SECRET this is the only thing that springs to mind.  There is a great BLUE LAGOON parody, which may be out of date, but with Survivor as the latest fad it may pass.",Null,14,21,17 August 2000
Wanted," a morally confused lifestyle flick with bullets as bling
","What did you do today? Just watching a movie, going to high school, or working at McDonalds or a generic version of Office Space? Are you an impossibly pathetic character whose movie-pretty girlfriend accepts your crappy apartment by the train tracks yet hates you enough to constantly cheat with one of your co-workers? Are you buying condoms for the best chum at work you know is doing your girlfriend? Well don't worry because all the skills of an assassin are biologically determined! A few punches in the face and some exercise and you will be James Bond perfect because your absentee father was and we all know DNA is much more important than practice or discipline.This movie gets all of its charm from the conceit that we know it is all part of the Matrix era bullet time slickness of action and the understanding that it all comes from a comic book anyway so if you have to pick someone up all you have to do is skid sideways right into the person at high speed with the door open and scoop 'em up. No danger of breaking his legs at all. And there can never be too many times two evenly matched assassins demonstrate the fact by their bullets crashing into each other harmlessly in mid flight.Angelina Jolie has said that sure she is carrying guns in this movie but she condones what happens to the characters so she could get behind the movie. However it resolves, though, most of the movie is a loser's fantasy of having an exciting life. That might very well suit the video game audience under 25 years old. But if you can't get past the improbable efficiency of the team and the improbable stupidity of the protagonist from scene to scene, the big twist that pats itself on the head for its brilliance will seem to belong in another movie. Had the action not been so cartoonish, maybe we could believe what it purports to say. It still exists in a vacuum-sealed circle of geek-hood one expects from Agent Cody Banks. The only difference is that he is twenty-something.",Null,48,98,7 August 2008
Spider-Man," grosses, no gross-outs: good movie
","So far the silliest thing I'm read from a professional critic is, 'The dialogue is too cartoon-ish.'A close second is (another critic) Roger Ebert's idea that the movie doesn't explore enough the horror of Peter Parker's metamorphosis.  Like a Fly-style approach directed by David Cronenberg would have really hit the spot.  Maybe a version where Toby has pinchers on his face and spends the movies screaming 'Why, God, why!!!!!  There must be no Godddddddd!'But I think too big a deal is being made about opening grosses.  I loved the movie, but opening grosses only show that there is a huge want-to-see factor.  Also - and I realize this is a minor factor - at least in Canada May 3 was chosen as the date to usher in yet another bump up in admission fees.",Null,0,0,6 May 2002
No Country for Old Men," nihilistic escapism
","Marred only by the fashionably nihilistic stated theme, the movie is fun to watch when it has momentum and also tense when it wants to be. But a grandmother character sticks out like a broken bone among an otherwise great cast as indirect as the screenplay tries to be with exposition it sounds ham-fisted in its attempts to prove the crazy hit-man baddie's world view correct. It will be called a 'smart man's thriller' but it still has moments where the audience may be brighter than the protagonist and a tracking device premise that we have already seen easily defeated in The Da Vinci Code. So much for playing superior, Coens. The movie is at its best in silent stretches, though tolerable when reflective. Based on a novel or not, for me it is the movie where Two-Face/Harvey Dent Tommy Lee Jones from Batman Forever is trying to track down a baddie who has the same quirk of coin-flipping to determine one's fate. It occurs to me that we give a bad guy more slack; he can be a superhuman Rambo figure sewing himself up and evading the worst you can dish out as long as he makes matters worse. It's not pandering to wish fulfillment fantasies, unless your wish is to steer clear of happy endings. Is there any such thing as a spoiler if the ending is a downer? I say no, but I've left out the details just in case.",Null,4,7,5 January 2008
The Love Guru," Far more entertaining than reading the reviews
","If you like the Austin Powers films, and you are not Hindu or gay, and you do not have a hatred of the long-suffering Toronto Maple Leafs, then there is a very good chance you will enjoy The Love Guru. The hit Mike Meyers films, live action or animated, contain scatological humor. Let's face it. This isn't finger-to-cheek recognition of humorous intent over a cup of bitter tea. This is just plain fun and you can either laugh out loud at some cheap laughs mixed into a few expensive ones or not. Seeing Sir Ben Kingsley take on the low-brow role as the mentor of Pitka is a delight; anyone else in the role wouldn't have been as amusing. There are some off-the-cuff politically incorrect terms used for gay, which no doubt irk many film critics enough to pad their reviews with exaggerated pronouncements about the entertainment overall. Apart from those concerns, the experience of watching the film would be quite like watching Austin Powers except that the stakes are more on a personal Wayne's World level. I'm not a hockey fan, but I don't mind a movie about it so that shouldn't impede your enjoyment. It is interesting to see Hockey Night in Canada depicted with it's original theme song intact, even though this will date the film. The audience I saw it with in Toronto seemed to be with it and enjoy the sophomoric twists on self-help catch phrases. It is both paying tribute to a fad that was popular a few years ago and also being irreverent first and foremost.",Null,8,22,20 June 2008
The Incredibles," Good start, but contains filler-action
","The movie is mostly front-loaded with clever and inventive ideas, the initial premise being very amusing until some of the action becomes a little tedious and working on only one level. Oddly, the boring stuff does look very good showing off impressive 'set' design. But the humor is not always layered in. Picks up again toward the end. Just to note, there are sequences where it is hard to distinguish between this and a straight-ahead animated superhero show. The element of satire is somewhat abandoned.In order to pad out my comments to at least five lines of writing, let's look at (or listen to) the soundtrack. Why is the music more evocative of James Bond than superheros? 007 May be classified as a super hero in this case only because he does manage to survive physical acts that would kill most people, but that is a movie convention more than a power. Also, I suppose the trope of the 'monologing' villain allowing the hero to survive is less a super hero thing than an action movie or Bond issue.",Null,0,1,27 November 2004

The Happening," best post 9/11 disaster film
","This is not just light, silly popcorn fare, as some people would present it. Expect to see something disturbing, something that sets your nerves on end. It may take shocking, unflinching scenes to reach certain people and put them in a state receptive to the speculations planted along the way which allow us to reflect on the mystery of the story's threat and by extension the fact of human influence upon the environment. The tone set and the gradual reveal of each new stage of trouble makes the Twilight Zone premise play as plausible and the inevitability of horror is riveting. After the first coda, there was one yahoo that booed at the screening, but his second noise after the final coda seemed less critical. A misanthrope at the end personifies the worst of community spirit but so much has been woven by the time she turns up that she is clearly part of the film's fabric and thesis. The film should at least appeal to people who like to slow past an accident knowing they may see something awful. Awful but very well done and unflinching. We become our own worst enemies, on more than one level. The film seemed to fly by, as well. I recognized an actor from Clerks in a silent bit role that must have included some dialog when he signed on; it plays as a bit of a distraction for me but it wouldn't register for a non-clerks fan. What we may gain is a sense of loss as each fleeting character is introduced and confronts death. I had thought the movie would be about a mere prank, but it is not. I hope the makers of the proposed remake of the Birds give up when they see The Happening. Maybe not give up on life, but just their own stab at man-versus-nature. The Happening is a keeper, ultimately not as dark in its resolution as The Mist but likely to be appreciated by the same audience.",Null,7,15,14 June 2008

Signs," good popcorn, but hold the 'pop' ?
","M. Night Shyamalan likes to take a pop culture genre gimmick formula seriously. There is a lot of sincerity in this film and I teared up a bit, but some people do have a problem with one central issue.  The theme of those who believe and those who don't plays like acknowledgment from the writer-director-supporting actor that if you don't believe in the first place this movie won't convince you.  It passes off screenplay structure mechanations as proof that God exists.  Perhaps God on this case is the sure-footed writer-director.  As in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, the movie ends up being about reflection and re-interpretation of past events, and that seems to be the the brand name stamp.  It also tries to advance on the searching for God theme which caused his first feature Wide Awake to tank.  As in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, such a search is a doomed set-up - either you find God and ta-DA! or you don't and you continue waiting for Godot.  Here, very genre specific pay-offs in the script - which work on their own - would have played better for most of the audience (and not so corny) if they had appeared in a Will Smith film.  In fact, there is a bit of an early John Carpenter low-budget fun aspect with Shyamalan using the limitations of space to avoid being distracted by Independance Day-style FX.  The heart of the film is in a dinner table scene and the way it portrays human beings confronting the prospect of losing each other and life itself.  If you have no rooting interest in seeing a faith character arc play out, don't see the movie.  But it worked for me.  I have to give Gibson and Shaymalan credit for daring to go for their ending shot in such a cynical time.",Null,1,1,14 August 2002
Cube," Nice look, shame about the end
","Cube has moments of suspense that really work.  I had to put it on pause once to take a break from the tension.  All of this despite the fact that there is too much damn dialogue and it poses like a great intellectual piece while at the same time including some extreme lapses in logic and an ending straight out of the worst moron slasher movie - which is all the more depressing because it robs the movie of any emotional resolution.  It takes itself way too seriously, and I am not saying that just because I am a Lucas-fed man-child hiding from reality.  Sure, I love the Original Trilogy, but what this movie is hiding from is A POINT.  It is something very well shot by Derek Rogers, but straining from someone's auteur stubbornness when it comes to leading the film somewhere or exploring the logic of certain scenes given what is later revealed as the villain is exposed.  There is nothing worse than a brilliant puzzle with a dumb villain to dillute it. However, I will give him this:  He does have a knack for sneaking up on people in a world where every opening door has a clearly established sound and he proved to be blessed with amazing brilliants when it comes to negotiating the maze ALONE as long as it is in the service of negative audience manipulation.  Had someone less tight-ass rewritten the script, it might have made money outside of France.  Okay, there is a following in the States, but all I can leave you with is this:  if you can see it for free and you have nothing better to do, fine.

This was a missed opportunity to be serious for me, since I could have mentioned that the reason I appreciated the fact that  (spoiler warning here IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM READ NO FURTHER) the budding romance between Jackie and Robert Forester is never consumated, and that he is left in silence because of his inability to take a vital big leap and abandon his business.  The scene would not have been poignant for me if I had never met N. H. McD.  She might have been trying to be real when she brought up the film, finally seeing the reality of the love I know for her.  But I digress. Live some life, then rate the movie.  Too bad you don't get to rate it twice, if you already have.  Jackie Brown is an underrated, mature work from Tarantino.  I hope he keeps going.",Null,0,1,18 August 2000
The Breakfast Club," Please NO REMAKE.
","John Hughes may do a sequel, using the same school or principal with different new students in modern day.  I would accept that, allowing him to exploit the title even though only one group called itself The Breakfast Club (or one character, Brian).  I would be able to handle Hughes revisiting the old cast, who might make themselves available.  But recasting the same roles with modern teens would be along the same lines as pulling a Gus Van Sant.  A Breakfast Club sequel, maybe co-written by Kevin Smith, might succeed.  But I can't stress enough how Judd Nelson should be the only person playing John Bender.",Null,0,1,1 September 2000
Back to the Future," Let's hope any future DVD includes the Eric Stoltz version of scenes he shot as 'extra features'
","This is one of my favorite films, one of the best constructed screenplays of all time.  You can nit-pick the logic of traveling through time and not 'space,' where the placement of the earth itself would not be the same as characters re-appear on the same (though transformed) street or property left behind. But the spirit of the film rises above logic with lines like, 'Don't worry, Marty.  As long as you hit the wire with the lightening rod at precisely eighty-eight miles per hour the instant the lighting strikes the tower. ..everything will be fine.' If I have one wish as a film fan it is to see the footage of one-third of the film that was shot with Eric Stoltz as Marty before Zemeckis and Spielberg decided to re-shoot with the less serious Michael J. Fox.   If anyone out there can campaign for this, PLEASE, let's not bury that material, which is what DVD should be used for.  It's not like Stoltz' career is hurting. It would be educational to see the 'dramatic' spin on the character.",Null,0,1,24 August 2000
