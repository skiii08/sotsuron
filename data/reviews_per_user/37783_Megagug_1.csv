The Avengers," Overrated
","I don't know why this movie was so popular, it had zero story, and simply felt like it was a comedy. That is one of my many problems with this movie:1. The movie might as well have been called 'iron man & friends' the entire thing just felt like Robert Downey Jr. trying to get attention.2. The action sequences were completely unoriginal, the battle of New York just felt like a copy of transformers 3.3. The aliens didn't actually do anything. All they did was blow up cars and fly around.This movie is passable, but completely overrated.",5,4,9,28 November 2013
