Ford v Ferrari," A lesson for screenwriters.
","This is a very well made film, from the writing all the way to makeup, hair, and wardrobe. What stands out for me is the writing, which is crucial. There's very nice character development which introduces us to the 2 leads and shows us who they are. Rather than just 'getting into it' with no introduction, we get to really like the leads and want to join them on their journey and want them to succeed. Without this, all you have are pretty faces, production value, vfx, chase scenes, and gun play.The icing on the cake is an epic moment that punctuates the one leads character arc. It's a moment that almost elicits tears.If you want to watch a great movie, which are few and far between, this is it.",Null,2,6,2 December 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Harrison Ford in a T-Shirt
","I wasn't exactly on fire to see this, but got the opportunity to see it for free and it hasn't made much of an impression on me. Nothing really stayed with me in terms of story or performance. It has too many anomalies and implausibilities not to mention it's fairly mundane in the way it plays out. WHY would a functional replicant be retired when all the guy was doing was growing protein on a farm (ya know, for humans?)HOW is it, the hero is a replicant that bleeds and has real childhood memories? WHY are the pair running the new Tyrell Corporation dealio so evil? Tyrell himself was a super-powerful but benevolent man which seems to me to be more apropos and more interesting. Why resort to the boring evil megalomaniac clichÃ©? Rachel copy has the wrong color eyes - so they shoot her in the head on the spot, WHAT? We find out Rachel had a functional womb here but there was no mention or hint of that in the original Blade Runner. Harrison Ford looked utterly ridiculous and out of place in this, traipsing around in an ironed t-shirt like he's been moving furniture out to the guest house on a Sunday afternoon or something.",Null,28,58,22 October 2017
Captain Marvel," Uninspired and forgettable
","There's ONE thing that can sink a film even with millions spent on effects, cast, and production design. They chose a completely unlikable actor to play the lead role who managed to neither inspire nor elicit sympathy. But that, coupled with a middling, unoriginal story (written by three writers!) with too many forced moments of attempted humor just overwhelmingly brings out the contrivance evident throughout the film in varying degrees. For the effects loving crowd, there is some eye candy in this but there's absolutely nothing memorable here.",Null,28,46,8 March 2019
Knives Out," Kind of a dumb story, huh?
","Enjoyable, sure, especially when we get to stare at Ana de Armas face for 2 hours. Craig's performance is fun and Shannon doesn't come across as his usual blue collar boob type, and even Evans was kind of interesting. But when you sit back and consider the story itself, the implausibilities start becoming more and more annoying.Nobody suddenly commits suicide when they're also making notes for future story ideas, sitting on a fortune, and coincidentally still even functional after a 100mg morphine injection. And cutting ones throat? Really?Who meets up with a known killer with a lot to lose in a private, remote location indoors??? If we've learned anything from a hundred years of movies and tv shows, it's that you always meet an adversary in a public place with a lot of people around. She may just be a housekeeper, but nobody is that dumb.Also, how are we to believe a private nurse who's given the same injections to the same patient in the same room probably hundreds of times would suddenly, accidentally mix up her vials?",Null,3,9,10 January 2020
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Is this a masterpiece?
","Pretty cool cast, and interesting premise muddied by oddities, implausibilities, and a juvenile sense of story. Is this a film set in a world where crazy stuff happens as a matter of course, or a normal every day world where crazy stuff happens every now and then? In this film, I see pretty normal people doing normal things and having normal things happen to them, so why is it the writer/director chose to litter what could have been a very good film with SO much bizarro bs? And with literally ZERO character development? Three giant billboards THAT close to the road and THAT close together - I've driven all over the country and never saw that. Billboards in rural areas tend to be smaller and definitely not that close together for obvious reasons. WHO is this woman, Mildred? We know literally nothing about her beside the fact that her daughter was murdered. Eventually we find out she's divorced and has a son who lives with her, but if one is to care about the protagonist, character development is crucial. As it is, it's interesting to watch her do and say crazy stuff, but I couldn't care less about her.WHY is it, two male characters directly related to the protagonist have a girlfriend & wife 20+ years their junior? Do they live in a part of the country where such a thing is commonplace? What are the odds of that? Probably about the same as if your dentist won the lottery but then your mailman did also. Yes, possible, but very, very odd and distracting.Why does Willoughby's wife have an English accent? Was he in the military and met her while overseas? Is it common for a small town in Missouri to have British accented residents? If there was ANY character development, maybe we'd know these things. As it is, it's distracting and elicits questions that shouldn't have to be asked. $5000/month for three previously forgotten about, decrepit billboards on a road people don't use anymore? LOL. For someone who is supposed to be a savvy, tough, non-nonsense older lady with the wisdom of the Buddha, that's pretty dumb.A cop smashes office windows, assaults a man and throws him out a 2nd story window with no jail time. Really?! Why does Willoughby have fatal cancer? Seems as no more than a cheap device used to heap more disdain on Mildred. Yawn. Dixon ends up in the same hospital room as the man he assaulted? Is that supposed to be ironic? And again, what are the odds? Mildred firebombs the police station, nearly kills a cop, and then just says 'I didn't do it' and that's the end of it?! Really? Some creepy stranger visits Mildred in her store and harasses her, THEN is overheard in a bar talking about committing a crime, maybe the crime in question, but alas even after Dixon cleverly retrieves dna from the guy, it turns out he's not even a local, and wasn't around when the crime occurred. Why then does the creepy guy know so much about the crime in question and WHY is he harassing Mildred!?!?!?! WHY?Then to top off ALL that nonsense, Dixon and Mildred decide to go murder the creepy guy anyway, LOL, how profound.",Null,280,456,28 December 2017
American Hustle," Performances outshine film.
","The acting performances are really the only bright spot in the entire movie but it's SO long that even the great performances become tedious after a while. It's never entirely clear if Bale's character or Adams' character have a specific goal in the story. They just sort of... do what they do. And I can't remember ever seeing Bale's eyes even once, which is odd and creates a significant barrier into his character for the audience. The camera work was painfully awkward and distracting and one could sense the editor's struggle to find optimal edit points in the strangely choreographed camera moves.The oddly written script was poorly paced and had a disjointed quality to it that I can't put my finger on. It was nice to see Elisabeth Röhm finally in a big studio film. I think DOR should have let this script percolate a while longer before execution of the film. It just seems poorly developed and the half-baked narrative isn't quite as amazing as Three Kings, Boogie Nights, or Silver Linings Playbook.I give it a 1/10 here only to offset the number of 10/10 votes but to me, it's a 6/10.",Null,2,3,1 January 2014
Baby Driver," Hugely overrated.
","This is one of those films that you keep watching to see something that hasn't happened in 300 other movies. Spoiler: Nothing does.Starts out ok and you think 'this could be cool,' but cool never materializes.",Null,1,1,30 June 2020
We're the Millers," Formulaic beyond belief.
","There was nothing in this movie for me. I'm sorry, but it plays out like any of the hundreds of 'unlikely people team up to go on an impossible mission...' movies that have been made in the past 20 years or so. You can actually predict plot points based on the characters, that's how contrived and hackneyed it is. Jennifer Aniston is a stripper at the beginning, so of course she'll be called upon to use her stripper ways to get the team out of a jam. Jason Sudeikis' character hates the middle aged Ned Flanders square in the beginning (in an RV) so of course that's exactly who (in an RV) he has to rely upon to save his arse and get the team out of a jam (who turns out to be a DEA agent - ugh).Ludicrous is all it is.",Null,5,10,28 August 2013
In Time," A tedious waste of a good premise.
","A most formulaic and tedious storyline for sure. Not even the awesomely captivating Amanda Seyfried could make this turd watchable for long. Good guys being chased, they take a break, and then the bad guys crash in on them, good guys run. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.Vincent Kartheiser was a nice surprise and Olivia Wilde wasn't in nearly long enough.As sci-fi goes, this is a very minor and forgettable film that completely wastes a very interesting and potentially compelling premise. My guess is the script was rushed and the suits at the studio all figured the cast and production value would get people in the theaters.",Null,1,5,2 December 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," A standard Anderson formulation
","Wes Anderson continues to mine cutesy Americana and kitsch with a genuine hipsters eye for offbeat ironic characters that all live in a world infused with the golden-honey color of nostalgia.In this particular world, the precocious runaway misfit hero children (one, the outcast of his scout camp, the other an angry and misunderstood daughter of two lawyers) of course posses the wisdom of the Buddha and freely dance a hipster dance to arcane retro hipster music (an Anderson hallmark) while the bumbling, evil grownups crash in and ruin everything by capturing the lovebird runaways and forcing them apart.But alas, the adventure continues as a rescue mission when suddenly (and seemingly for no real reason) the fellow camp-mates decide to spirit the two adolescent outcast delinquents away to live happily ever after.As per usual in the tiresomely whimsical worlds Anderson designs, reason and logic are sacrificed willingly for the sake of his symmetrically framed hipster fairytale narratives. Even though, as in our own everyday reality where fish don't walk and people cannot fly, things happen that defy the actual laws of physics and human nature that we've all come to know and rely upon. In the end, a love story is a love story and apparently - nothing else matters.",Null,2,5,14 November 2012
Life," Garbage in space
","Starts out well enough and contains literally ALL the requisite (and time-worn) space movie clichés, then very soon into the story it becomes more an amalgam of other space horror films we've all seen multiple times over the years. Be prepared to be faced with the need to suspend disbelief and boredom. There's literally not a single new thing in this film compared to a few dozen (at least) similar films that came before it.",Null,0,4,1 April 2017
The Runaways," Not quite
","To be honest, I expected this movie to be only a middle of the road offering and that's essentially all it is in the end.Watching and listing to it, I couldn't help but feel like there was so much missing on multiple levels that it became a very frustrating experience to sit through it.Is it shocking? Hardly. Should it have been? It would have helped.There's nothing in the film that's anywhere near 'in your face' as you'd expect, based on the music, other than Michael Shannon's most awesome performance.I've seen a LOT of films about rock bands - some fictional and some real, and this I'm afraid pales in comparison to not only ANY great film, but all those that attempt to depict the personalities involved.",Null,1,6,4 July 2010
The Martian," NO character arc. NO character development.
","Once upon a time, screenwriters exposed the 'inner life' of the main characters through a thoughtful series of expository scenes in a film preceding the main storyline. In doing so, a viewer would come to an understanding of the character and developed an interest in their well-being and imminent growth.Flaws and character exposed, the screenplay would feature at its core a protagonist who struggled with obstacles to achieve a goal, and in doing so would experience quantifiable growth by the end of the screen story. This is known as a 'character arc,' and gives a viewer a resolution in the sense that the protagonist changed for the better by the end of the film, and may very well have achieved a goal (or may not have.) This film has neither of the above and instead jumps head first into a narrative that while it is compelling, left me with little real interest in the end result of the protagonist. The story is compelling, but I found myself with a feeling genuine dissatisfaction by the end due to distinct lack of partnership with the protagonist and his struggle. If you like films based on a compelling point of departure that offer little more than production value, A-list acting talent, and special effects, then this is for you.",Null,11,24,5 November 2015
