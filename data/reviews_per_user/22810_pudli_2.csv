50 First Dates," excellent piece, underrated!
","This is an excellent romantic story, also some very-very good quality humor included.I don't know what else can be a possible better romantic piece. Different can be, but better not. Sandlers best piece, so far no doubt. Good acting from the father, brother and the bar staff.Not a deep story, but more than enough for thinking about it, more better than a pointless romantic crap. I feel sorry, why is it so underrated. This kind of brain damage is so exotic, (dont wanna be rude) that makes this movie a really good tale, as well. Looking forward to Sandlers new pieces. The only one thing i can mention as negative is that the movie was not long enough, I could watch some more funny days of this story.",10,0,0,1 October 2004
Spider-Man: Homecoming," abysmal
","You might gonna enjoy this if you are below the age of 13-14... Worst Spiderman movie ever. The actor is terrible, the story is terrible, Iam not sure who wrote the script for this cinema. Either a 10 years old or a pocket calculator. I would not recommend this to You at all unless You are a kid",1,56,91,29 September 2017
