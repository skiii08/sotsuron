Angels & Demons," Ignore negative reviews, of critics, and non-critics
","Agreed: poor performance by Vittoria Vetra, and rather quick-solving of all puzzles, or clues. But still, I don't agree that Angels and Demons was one of the 'let-downs' of this year. It was good! Perfect symbols or Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Good pace, good performance by Camerlengo and Robert Langdon, good sound effects and music, good sound editing, brilliant cinematography and direction, good editing, a little-hard-to-understand-for-the-layman script but still, how much simpler could it be made? Angels and Demons story follows as such: a pope dies, and somewhere in CERN, a father and daughter create the OPPOSITE or matter, that is ANTIMATTER, which is highly dangerous if it comes in contact with anything that is MATTER, even AIR. So when a Pope in the Vatican has died, and the father who made antimatter is murdered, one thing is obvious: the age-old group of Scientists, Illuminati, have risen again, to take revenge against those who refuted them years ago: the catholic church. And what better time than when a new pope is to be chosen? With the antimatter stolen, Vittoria knows one thing: it can take out the whole of Vatican City if set off. And soon enough, four favorite cardinals are kidnapped, and to be executed one by one every hour. Can the symbologist, Robert Langdon, hand in hand with Vittoria, stop the murders, and stop the ANTIMATTER before it sets off? And who is behind this all? Surely no one can be trusted.This film is one of the highlights of 2009. Go watch it. If you've read the book, you won't love it as much as you'll love it if you HAVEN'T read the book. And yes, for younger, SUBTITLES could be really helpful.I only gave it a solid 7/10 because I've read the book, and of course, the book was MUCH MUCH better.",7,7,13,20 June 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Cool.
","X-Men Origins: Wolverine or X-Men 4, is in fact a prequel to the X-Men Trilogy. It tells the story of the life of Logan, or Wolverine, and how he came to be what he is in X-Men one and through out.Though not the best of X-Men movies, this one certainly left a mark. The beginning is a bit drama-ish, but it just gets better as it goes on. The action is fast, and the graphics and animation is quite-close-to-real types. The cinematography is brilliant, hand-in-hand with the editing. The flow of the movie is smooth, courtesy the direction. Sound effects - good, performances were OK, nothing great. X-Men is one of those movies that really aren't the 'can't miss it ones' but definitely the 'must see' types.I only gave it a 7/10 because it's not as good as X-Men 1, or 2. A good movie sets a bar for its sequel, and if the sequel falls below the bar, then the person may not be disappointed, but definitely would notice the difference.Go watch it. It's worth it.",7,2,4,23 June 2009
Interstellar," A Philosophical Revelation with Scientific Rationality makes this my Greatest Film-Watching Experience Ever
","It's exceedingly rare for a film to make me forget it's a film - but Interstellar managed to knock me out of my senses in a way I had never imagined. Here's the thing about films like Interstellar: the experience of these films starts way before their release, and lingers on in your bodies as a wonderful sensation way after they are over. Christopher Nolan, god bless that genius, announced Interstellar a week after the release of TDKR, and since then, we his fans have driven ourselves mad trying to figure out what Nolan would do with Black Holes and Time Travel and such alike - and what he does is not only brilliant, but beautiful in unthinkable ways.I really need a second viewing to fully be able to appreciate the technical elements of the film, because after a point, really, I was too immersed in the whole experience of it to bother paying attention. But the cinematography, editing, visual effects, set design, the score (Oh, Hans Zimmer!), Nolan's direction, the performances, all combined into a powerful 3 hours that transports you to another universe for the whole time. They did their jobs perfectly so honestly I wouldn't be able to find a flaw. Some have criticized the sound design but I disagree: it was all just so beautiful. So perfect. Nolan raises so many questions in our minds and answers them so beautifully as time goes. I loved this. I absolutely loved this and I implore you to go and watch it and experience and understand what cinema is really, really about.For those who have not seen it, please do not read on. Just go watch it.A solid 12/10 - because yes, it dares to go beyond.***SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***Let me shrug off the criticism against it: the emotional quotient - 'Love'. 'Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.' It's been said by many that the emotional quotient of this film takes away from the 'other' parts of it, however, the 'many' may not have fully understood what Nolan was trying to say. Think of love as a physical being - an actual something that literally 'transcends' time and space - think of love itself as the fifth dimension beyond time! This whole wonderful journey is the process of understanding this truth, told through the stranded relationship of a daughter and father. Being a student of philosophy myself, this whole concept visualized with scientific rationality is a kind of dream-come-true for me. It is not a film for the pleasure of viewing the film - it raises and answers in its own logic the questions that humankind is yet to find answers to in real life. This film is a realization in the purest sense - this film goes beyond itself, beyond the concept of being just a film. Nolan does the unthinkable: in the never-ending debate between religion and science about the ultimate source of energy for the world, Nolan finds a middle ground.This film is Revelation. Wow. Just wow.",10,12,26,7 November 2014
Avatar," Avatar - the disappointing Cameron film
","Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for the most well-done CGI hand in hand with the most disappointed movie of the year - yes, put your hands together for Avatar.No, no - don't get me wrong. The movie's not bad. But the script is horribly weak! I don't know if this has anything to do with the fact that I was watching a dubbed version, but the dialogues were disappointing enough. Cameron has come up with the most convincing CGI production, but, I wonder why, he only relies on the CGI? Why didn't he work more on the story and, specially the script? The direction is very slow at times, and tends to get irritating. The predictability of the movie is the worst part. We're tired of the some-stroke-of-luck last- minute-life-saving moments of the lead roles. Let them DIE man!Go watch Avatar for the deliciously sweet eye-candy, but if you're hoping for something big, then you might as well skip it.",6,11,24,17 December 2009
3 Idiots," Aal izz... aalmost perfect.
","Perfect. Almost. Oh yeah... those are the words! I'm writing this at the 8th hour of the morning of 25th December. Merry Christmas, viewers, this is the perfect treat. I was lucky enough to have caught a special preview of the year's best movie, 3 Idiots, last night. Aamir Khan fans, after a disastrous Ghajini, prepare to be truly delighted! He once again shows his 'perfectionist' attitude with this highly-anticipated soon-to-be blockbuster! It has EVERYTHING - from good humour, to emotions that actually move you. When a sense of fear is supposed to be created, it is created, and when you're supposed to feel good, you do! Remarkable performances by each and every one of the characters just adds to the entire effect. A nice-to-listen-to soundtrack assures you that even the song sequences aren't boring. And over that, such beautiful choreography! Witty dialogues and hilarious one-liners keep you wanting for more, and some head-bobbing suspense makes you wonder as well...But, above all, above EVERYTHING else, what truly, TRULY makes this movie work is Rajkumar Hirani's brilliant sense of direction. How he cuts between the past and the present, at the perfect moments, is just amazing. With this, he could finally emerge as one of the leading directors of the country today.3 Idiots is based on the book Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, even though it's hugely different. And, for the first time in my life, I can proudly say that yes, finally, a movie has not just done justice to the book, but easily surpassed it. All thanks to Rajkumar Hirani. And proudly too because an Indian did it! I have to be strict... it's an Aamir Khan movie. So I have no option but to cut off 1 for the editing and dubbing errors.9/10. What more do you want? Don't miss it for anything!",9,38,80,24 December 2009
Inception," Ironically... a Dream Come True!
","I always type my reviews in Notepad, but no – Inception deserves better. After a run of the most amazing films ever – Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Prestige, and of course, The Dark Knight (my all time favourite!), Nolan is finally ready with his next experiment: Inception, a dream-come-true movie (which is kind of ironic!) that makes us question the existence of the very world around us. One assumed that The Dark Knight was the ultimate peak that any film maker could ever reach – Nolan included – but this young director refuses to accept that there is a Cloud 9 – and simply questions, 'What next?' And BANG answers it himself: Inception. My new all-time favourite.The English Dictionary defines 'inception' as 'origin' – basically, that is what the film is about. It's about planting an idea in someone's mind, hence, 'originating' an idea in that person. It's the most amazing experiment anyone has ever performed: an impossible world where you enter dreams, and dreams within dreams, and dreams within those, until you realize that such a movie is only ever found in dreams, except that Nolan doesn't think so.Nolan uses his incredible direction skills in this movie to make it the wonder it is. His direction is what makes this film tick. His timing is just amazing. Caprio does full justice to his character, Cobb. Zimmer's music keeps us with Nolan's pace, which is why it all turns out to be so incredible. The cinematography, superb, the special effects, superb, the editing, perfect, the script, brilliant. This movie has everything!But then the only question that people are asking now is – which one is it – The Dark Knight, or Inception? I'll be blunt honest. The reason Memento didn't work as well as TDK, despite being an amazing film, is that it wasn't a film for everyone. Only those people who're willing to take the weight, the tension, and those who have a high presence of mind, and an understanding of the complexity of a highly complex film will be able to fully enjoy the film. Inception pushes TDK aside with ease, but not for the entire world. If one has noticed, then you can see that Nolan is following an alternative pattern in all his films that have made it to the Top IMDb 250: Memento, highly complex, Batman Begins, not so, Prestige, complex again, The Dark Knight, not so, and now Inception, his most incredible project.I immediately called up people after the movie, telling them to go watch it, and I was shocked beyond anything when one of the friends said, 'I'm going for Eclipse. Can't.' Learn your lesson, people, do NOT miss this wonder. Like Toy Story, this too comes once in a decade. Though in Nolan's case, that's not true. Trust Nolan. Now, I can't wait for Batman 3.10/10. Damn! Isn't there anything more than that?",10,8,17,16 July 2010
Toy Story 3," Senorita! What a wonder!
","I was glad to find out that my little hometown had decided to put up Toy Story 3 in PVR, and that too in 3D. Hearing this, I left the toilet midway (:P) and rushed to book the tickets for the next available show. 11 years and here it was... Toy Story 3 was officially out in India. Having seen Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2, the latter being my favourite Pixar production, obviously my expectations were, least to say, 'sky- high'. I must slap myself for doubting them, I must throttle myself for even thinking it, I should get 'lasered' by a real Buzz Lightyear for being afraid of it, and I must get 'coyboyed' by Woody for having second thoughts about the result... but guess what. After close to 2 hours of delight, depression, hope, inspiration and a pure heart-warming tale, I suddenly had a new favourite Pixar, and I daresay a new 2nd favourite (nothing beats TDK): Toy Story 3.Funnily enough, the basic central theme of all Toy Story's is the same: Rescue. However, it's HOW the theme is shaped and shelled that makes a movie 'awful', 'ok', 'good', 'great'... or 'Toy Story 3'. I tried to be as cruel to the movie as possible, trying to find mistakes, trying to find a loophole, trying to locate ONE black spot in pure, white, serene beauty, but I couldn't. The Direction: Perfect. Lee has done a wonder job with it. No bumps, no goofs, no feeling of 'What? Why? How?'. Everything is so well explained, so well done, every action and event has an explanation. Music: Makes the movie what it is. Gives it the feel.Script: Wow. Wow. Wow. And wow.Editing: Perfect.Cinematography: Though there isn't any, the sense of cinematography is totally perfect.Voice(s): Oscar winning performances, for the voices at least...Ideas & Concepts: From the most heartwarming scene, to the most threatening scene, to the most touching scene... to the most hilarious scene ever (Buzz! Senorita!). The ideas that are reflected in these scenes... and again the direction... makes you ACTUALLY experience the moment.And finally...The Animation: What can I say... Pixar is already perfect but somehow they're getting better and better. Perfect movements, which create perfect moments, amazing sense of animation, the reflections, the expressions... the... well, everything.But what is it that makes this movie what it is? I don't know. I watched this movie once but I guess that wasn't enough. I'm gonna watch this movie again, again, again and again. But I know that I still won't be able to tell you WHAT it is that makes this movie the wonder it has turned out to be. All I can say is, don't give a DAMN about the price of the ticket, this movie is priceless. Grab the next opportunity, and make way for it if you don't get one, but go, 10-year-olds, 20-year-olds, 40- year-olds, 80-year-olds... there's something in there for everybody. Go. Don't waste more time. Go and live a wonder that I think will never, ever, EVER, come again.A perfect 10/10.",10,3,4,25 June 2010
