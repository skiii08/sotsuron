Sucker Punch," Metaphors over Metaphors
","This movie is actually pretty complex and intelligent in spite of its bad reputation as a meaningless action flick. The most entertaining part of it all is, how few people seem to have noticed many of the metaphors within the movie. It's pretty funny to read stuff like:'Are you kidding me? I think I've seen this movie before in Every Video game ever made''What's with the blonde idiot pretending that she can 'fight', when it's painfully obvious that she has NO idea of what she is doing. She certainly can't act!'Guess that punch really hit homebase :)Good movie with a fitting title.",9,5,10,12 July 2013
