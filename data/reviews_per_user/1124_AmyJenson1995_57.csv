Mission: Impossible III," Much better than MI2
","This third installment of the Mission Impossible series is a mix between MI1 and MI2. While the first Mission Impossible focused on the story and MI2 on action, Mission Impossible 3 is allowing both of them.The storyline is much better written than the one in the first sequel. The scenarists got the good idea to include a romance within it. A real romance where Ethan is in real love and is about to marry. This makes him more human than in MI2 but also much more vulnerable to his enemies. And Davian is particularly a mean one. The confrontation between him and Ethan is what make this movie so thrilling because the villain is mentally torturing Ethan making him his pawn and forcing him to do the dirty work for him. It's something we haven't seen before and it's quite well played by both the actors.But MI3 is also an action movie and it's full of it. The only difference with MI2 is it's not overplayed. In MI2, because the story was inexistent, all was focused on the action staging with a lot of explosions, spectacular combat moves and bike chases. Here it is simpler but it's still entertaining because there is an efficient storyline alongside it. The locations are still breathtaking especially Shanghai and the Vatican.In conclusion I gave it a 7 out of 10. If you are looking for a great action movie, watch MI3.",7,1,1,10 September 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good but not awesome introduction to the saga
","As a big Star Wars fan, I expected a lot from this movie. I wasn't born yet when the first 3 movies got released to general public but I saw them all multiple times and I always have the same amazement while watching them. They revolutionized the way to do Sci-fi movies and always will be considered as classics.The prequel movies are less captivating my attention even if I like them a lot. The Phantom Menace is the one I like the least.The only purpose of this movie was to introduce us to several Star Wars famous characters: Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, Palpatine, R2-D2 and C3-PO. It also adds new characters like Qui-Gon, Padmé Amidala and Jar Jar Binks.This last character was focusing the attention. I don't know what he brings to the story. He is clumsy and all he is doing is messing around and only succeeds to escape a dangerous situation thanks to a great shot of luck. He is technically insignificant and just here for a comic purpose. But it's rather annoying than anything else.Padmé is more interesting to the story. She is reminding Leia. She has the same will to fight rather than surrendering and she is really tougher than she actually looks. We can see it during the final battle on Naboo. So I could feel that she and Anakin would be in a relationship in the next movies.Qui-Gon Jin is an interesting add too as Obi-Wan Kenobi mentor and master. He is bold and wise in the same time, coping with the Jedi way while still trying to keep his independence, which push him to disagree with the order on some matters.But the one character who is particularly underrated is Palpatine. Ian McDiarmid is one genius actor. He already starred as Palpatine in the original trilogy and he kept the essence of the character which is deep evil in a deceptive respectable appearance. That is certainly the best move from George Lucas to cast him again as Palpatine so does his decision to call Anthony Daniels to reprise his role as C3PO.Now as always the story telling is beautifully managed. There is a continued story between the movies and the Phantom Menace acts as a beautiful first chapter. It is visually and orally enjoyable to see. The CGIs help a lot the story and keep us entertained. So it deserves a 7 out of ten because realizing a prequel while we already know in depth the story and then keeping all the suspense away is a hard task. But it still manages to be decent.",7,1,2,13 September 2015
Ali," Float like a butterfly, Sting like a Bee
","As we celebrate one of the finest sportsmen in history who died two days ago at age 74, I decided to see this movie dedicated to him, Cassius Clay famously known as Muhammad Ali starring Will Smith as the main role.I never watched one of his fights as his career was over even before I was born. I'm not a real fan of boxing either which I find violent and ruthless. But I still know about Muhammad Ali and his legendary stance, his endless will to fight both on the ring and outside. A man who stood for his beliefs and opinions, never flinching once.My very big, personal memory of him was when I watched him in Atlanta, brandishing the Olympic Torch to light the Cauldron. Despite shaking from all his body, he was standing there with so much pride. I was amazed and truly impressed, almost having a tear and getting chills. That was Muhammad Ali, a man of valor, honor and pride.Another proof of his character was when he refused to be drafted for the Vietnam War because he thought this war wasn't right and the complete opposite to his religious beliefs. Despite he knew what he was about to face, he never flinched and assumed his decision until he was finally cleared.Now that I saw that movie, I think it's making a nice tribute to Mr Ali even if I wished that it wouldn't stop at the Rumble in the Jungle, the historic bout between Ali and George Foreman. I would have wished to see him fighting his illness as he was as brave against it and it had a deep impact in his life until his death. Maybe they should have made it in two parts as there is so much to tell about the man.Anyway, I applaud Will Smith performance in this movie. It's one of his finest. He has the same cheekiness, the same way of saying the things straight in an humorous manner. Will was the perfect choice for the role. I also appreciated Jamie Foxx performance as his mentor. Most of the note I give is because of those two.",7,1,2,5 June 2016
Skyfall," Where it all began
","After Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, here is the third movie with Daniel Craig starring as 007 James Bond. To be honest, I had quite a mix feelings when I pushed the theater door and took a seat. Casino Royale was a masterpiece, a fresh breath, a movie I love to watch anytime. Quantum of Solace was less successful, less entertaining. So I didn't know what to expect of Skyfall but as soon as the movie starts and I saw that familiar shape, I felt myself as watching a Bond movie again.This movie has the privilege to introduce two familiar characters, Moneypenny and Q. The first is now black but she is really sexy on her way and quite teasing which brings a lot of fun to the lines. She is also a field agent and knows how to handle a gun. That surprised me a lot and I kinda like the idea to be honest. Q on the other hand is odder. He is a geek, a kid and he is far less memorable than the original Q, Desmond Llewelyn. Q has the gift to bring humor within the movie but in Skyfall, all his jokes fall flat and he seems way too pretentious which will bring him to be played by the villain.Ah let's talk about the villain. What a relief to find someone who could match James Bond. Someone who was his image of the past and decided to take his revenge on M who sold him out to his enemies. Someone who knows MI6 like no one else and uses this knowledge to bring in down. Javier Bardem is by far one of the greatest villain we could have seen in a Bond Movie. He gives chills in every of his scene and was very convincing in his role. He gave a lot of challenge to James Bond and it was a guilty pleasure to see both engaging a fight for survival.Daniel Craig keeps being James Bond in his very skin. He is now experienced and enjoys a little bit of dark humor. But he is still as profound as in the other movies. It's also bringing a lot of good memories when he get back aboard the legendary DB7 from Goldfinger, THE James Bond car. That was delightful and depressing when we witness such a beautiful car being blown up at the end of the movie.So to conclude, when I left the theater, I was happy and relieved. Now I can't wait to see Spectre.",9,2,6,3 June 2015
The Hangover," One of the funniest movie I've ever seen
","There are events in our lives that just can go awfully wrong like a bachelor/rette party. In that case, it's 4 guys who just want to celebrate the last night of freedom of one of them at the beach around a bonfire in Las Vegas. Harmless in the mind but when one of them has a wonderful idea to add drugs to the party, everything goes upside down. When the day came over, the groom is missing, the other three are in a mess with a tiger in their bathroom and a chicken in the living room. In order to find their missing friends, the last three have to remember what happened during this one wild night and enjoy the mess they created throughout the city. The funniest part of this movie is the crazy journey those guys had been through, with every people reacting to their presence as they saw the devil coming back and most of all the reaction of the three guys when they realize the huge mess they created at each place they visited. And this lasts to the very end of the movie when they find back the groom and bring him back in time for the ceremony. This is funny as well and it deserves the recognition this movie had throughout the world. Just like the two sequels which followed.",10,1,4,27 February 2015
United 93," A great memorial to those American Heroes
","As an American girl, everything related to the horrible events of 9/11 is making me crying. Documentaries, movies, photos of people who died that day is tearing me apart.This movie about the heroes of Flight 93, the last plane hijacked by the Al Qaeda terrorists and crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania is particularly moving.Those 36 heroes who sacrificed their life while trying to regain control of the aircraft, saved thousands of people that horrific day. This movie is a powerful memorial and is making us very proud of those anonymous people for what they did for the country.United 93 is also focusing on the people who were on the ground and were witnessing the terrible events which were unfolding that day. While the entire world was watching the tragedy live and trying to make a sense of it, the ATCs, NORAD and FAA officials were struggling to get the situation back into control and despite the incredible confusion going on, did what they could.Some directors could have decided to turn this into a Hollywood movie and exaggerate the facts but Paul Bluegrass decided to stick to the reality and real history as much as he can and we can feel he and his staff made a lot of research to really honor those heroic passengers. This is very respectful and honorable and I'm sure that the families appreciate it a lot.May all those heroes rest in peace and never ever be forgotten.",10,0,1,15 September 2015
If I Stay," Really moving and graceful
","I heard a lot of good things about this movie from my friends, from some of my family members, mostly girls. So I decide to give it a shot and I was moved by this powerful movie.It's not that the story is great. It is a good one but not a new one. It is not the first time such theme as an out of body experience is exploited. But this love story between Mia, a talented but shy Cello player and Adam, a future rock star to be, is really touching and a tearjerker. 2 worlds collide but they do a wonderful union.The two main actors, Chloe Grace Moretz and Jamie Blackley have a really good chemistry between them. There are a lot of scene which makes me cry especially the last one when Adam starts singing a song he wrote for her telling how much he loves her and how he wants her to wake up to fully live their passion. Stacy Keach is also very touching in his role of a grandfather so proud of his granddaughter and who is completely torn to have lost his son, daughter in law and grandson, whose only hope left is to see Mia waking up.But Chloe's performance is so touched by grace. Seeing her realizing how much she has lost in that car crash, seeing the people she cherishes the most passing away, completely powerless. Her performance makes me cry all alone. She really proved how talented she is and I truly hope a lot of directors have seen her golden talent as well. Kick ass is just fun but If I stay is much deeper and she managed to have the right tone and attitude in the perfect time.I'm so glad to have followed my friends and family's advice and now I'm going to read the books.",10,0,0,17 September 2015
A Star Is Born," I'll Always Remember Them This Way ♥
","There is something magnetic about this movie. I don't know if it's the amazing musical performances, the love story between Ally and Jack or the incredible chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga both on screen and outside which makes me feel that way. Probably the combination of both 3.Let's start with the musical score first. It's needless to say that each time Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper start performing, you're entering in another world. Of course I already knew that Gaga is a very talented performer but in this movie, she blew me away. She trades her eccentric costumes and make-up for a natural look making her almost unrecognizable and much more attractive. All we have left of the Gaga we all know is her incredible voice. And that's all we need.Bradley, on his end, blew me away as well. I know he's a talented actor but I never imagined how a lovely voice he has or how great of a guitar player he is. I know he took lessons to become Jackson but you need to have already something within yourself to be able to reach that level. That huge load of work paid off!But what makes this film so amazing is the amazing chemistry between each other. Some may say that's just acting but no. Each time we see them together, you're feeling a connection which cannot be faked. And this relationship gives so much strength to the love story between Jack and Ally. It feels authentic and raw, never fading away. When you see the interviews, you can feel there is a huge amount of respect and care for each other. No doubt a beautiful friendship has been born out of it and who knows how it could turn in the near future? ;)",10,0,0,8 February 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The missing piece
","When Rogue One was released, I didn't have any particular expectation about it. I was quite disappointed by the Force Awakens released a few months earlier but as many of my friends who happen to be great Star Wars fans begged me to go see it, I've given up and gave it a shot. And I don't regret anything about it.Rogue One is the Star Wars movie we should all expect to see. It has the sense of epicness the previous trilogies have, the same taste of visual and sound marvel and they have characters we could truly identify with. It has also some very well placed dose of humor which is welcome to enlighten the mood a little.Because we should not be mistaken about it: this movie is very dark as it's the direct prelude of Episode IV where the Empire is ruthless as ever without any sight of hope to see. The Alliance is still burgeoning and struggling to survive and almost to the point of breaking up and surrender. The only hope will come through this bunch of ordinary heroes who are willing to risk everything including giving up their lives to give the Alliance that will which would allow them to defeat Evil.Jyn Erso has nothing special just like we thought Luke was before we learned of his past. She is the daughter of a genius scientist who got kidnapped by the Empire to create what will become the Death Star. Trying to survive on her own, she is rescued by the Alliance so she could help them locate her father and destroy the Death Star before it's becoming operational. Here begins an epic journey which will drive them to go straight in the clutch of their enemies to steal the blueprints of the deadliest and most powerful weapon ever and finally give the galaxy a new hope to triumph from Evil.This movie has so many assets and it uses it very efficiently. First it has a true purpose as it's the last piece of the puzzle. It explains us and give us many answers to questions which were left as a mystery. For example we never knew if that fatal flow of the Death Star which caused her explosion was an accidental mishap or a deliberate attempt to thwart the project. With Rogue One that mystery is answered. We also know how Tarkin got control of the Death Star or how Leia got involved with all of this. Rogue One in that aspect was necessary.Second it allowed us to meet again characters we fought long gone like Governor Tarkin, Gold Leader, Red Leader, Bail Organa or young Leia thanks to the incredible ingeniousness of Light & Magic. Those people are so talented it's mesmerizing. They deserve an award just for being able to recreate those legendary characters and inserting them into that newly created story. It was ambitious and risky but it worked to the perfection. I had a chill watching them coming back to life once again. It was eerie. And of course we meet Darth Vader once again. That part was probably the best one ever of the movies. Rogue One surely wrote another part of the legend of Darth Vader. The two scenes he appears are chilling and breathtaking truly showing how raw and powerful this legendary character is! That was something Gareth Edwards did very great.Now let's talk about the locations: Scarif is breathtaking. It truly looks like a postcard place with its sandy beaches, teal waters and tree palms if only it wasn't used as the Archives of the Empire and the main scene of a destructive and bloody battle. Jeddah is the recurring sandy planet each Star Wars is obliged to have but it's still very interesting to see with its atmosphere and great array of population communities, one of another recurring theme every Star Wars Movie has to show.Finally the musical score. As a Star Wars movie, its score has to match the epic feeling of the movie, the tension of the scenes. Michael Giacchino did a great job at it especially the final battle which was a real pleasure to the ear. If it was John Williams well I wouldn't be surprised one bit, but for a newcomer, it's impressive so great job Michael.So to conclude, Rogue One deserves to be considered as canon. It has it all: the epic story, the great cast, the visual masterpiece, the music score and the creativity. George Lucas once told that among all the movies Disney released since they took over, Rogue One was by far his favorite. Well I cannot agree more when you see how disgraceful Star wars has become since then.",10,1,2,15 April 2017
Zootopia," Zootopia
","I heard a lot of great things about this movie, not only from the critics or this website but also from some of my friends living abroad and who had the chance to see this movie weeks before me.So when it was finally released over here, I wanted to look by myself alongside one of my friends and her two children. And I loved it too.The first thing to say is Zootopia is a typical Disney Movie. It has this fairy side we find in each of their pictures, symbolized by this huge metropolis called Zootopia. It's a magical combination of several worlds connected to each other where animals of each sort, preys as predators, live in harmony and peace which is by the way another favorite Disney Theme.It has also this huge dose of cuteness throughout the characters of the movie starting with Judy, this cute young doe which wishes to be the first of her kind becoming a police officer. Something she succeeds to achieve through hard work and dedication, another familiar Disney theme (You can achieve anything if you believe in yourself). The other characters are as attaching especially Flash, a very funny sloth who is really irresistible in each scene he appears. Nick, Judy's partner is as adorable as her under his attitude of a tough guy is secretly hiding a fear of being rejected because he's a fox.But there is also something new, something we never see in a Disney cartoon before: The police investigation side. It's unexpectedly thrilling with its very noire ambiance, its characters scarier than usual but which still includes a certain sense of parody. As it's a Disney movie, nobody dies but it's still thrilling following Judy and Nick into their investigation which is very well built. I truly hope this side will be including in the next Disney movies.When the movie was finally over, I had a very great time and judging by how my friend's children were cheering and wishing to become cops when they'll be older, I can safely assume they did as well. It deserves the rave reviews it received worldwide. Zootopia is definitely a great surprise and a picture to see if you wish to enjoy an amazing family time.",9,3,13,11 March 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Do we have a heading? Yes for greatness!
","There are movies which are giving our faith back into the movie industry. Movies which are refreshing an entire genre in a very good way and will become a new model for films to come.Since it has been released in 2003, I have been a huge fan of the Pirates of The Caribbeans saga. It's epic, funny, well directed and played, the CGIs are awesomely shot, the soundtrack is epic as well. There's nothing to throw away.But the real magnet to this movie is Johnny Depp aka Jack Sparrow. He is cheating, awkward, a real loon but god he's so awesome! Johnny is displaying all his talent and class throughout the movie and is really the one we will always come to mind first when we talk about Pirates of the Caribbean.Although it would be terribly unfair to not praise the performance of the rest of the cast as they are as awesome as Mr Depp. Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally play their part perfectly and all are bringing their part to the plot.Talking about that, the story is as epic as it could be. A mix between paranormal, adventure, comedy and action, it's keeping us entertained from start to finish and never letting us get bored. Some of the scenes are really scary like the one when Elizabeth discovers the terrible curse the Black Pearl crew is suffering and try to stop.Romance has not been forgotten as well. The love triangle between Will, Elizabeth and Commodore Norrington is an entire part of the story as it's the main motive running through the movie. When Elizabeth is kidnapped by Barbossa, Will is going to her rescue ready to ally with someone he despise so much at the beginning to succeed in his task. Both of them are so cute and sympathetic.Another great asset is the music. It's at the image of the movie: epic and adventurous. It's a perfect match to the tempo of the movie and the genre theme. Hans Zimmer did a perfect job once again.To me it deserves a 10.",10,1,2,29 October 2016
The Notebook," If you're a bird, I'm a bird
","As I'm a romantic person, I have seen a lot of romantic dramas and The Notebook has a very special resonance within me.There are so many romantic movies in the market which feel redundant and not particularly bringing memorable souvenirs. But the Notebook is one of those films which is touching your deep soul because its story reflects what true, real love is and it can trump everything.The Notebook tells the story of Noah and Ellie, two sweet souls who comes from entirely different worlds. He is a poor blue collar worker who lives in a small South Carolina town. She is a rich heiress from Charleston. They were never meant to be a couple but they fall in love and founded an amazing family despite the odds and their social ranks differences. Their story is told through an old man in an hospice in our nowadays era who is reading his own notebook to a fellow female resident struggling with dementia. It turns out that the old man is Noah, the female resident is Ellie and he is actually recounting their own love story so she could remember how much in love they are. They have 3 children and two grandchildren.It's not the first time the theme of two people crazily loving each other despite their social ranks is used to make a movie but I felt transported by the grace of the actors and the feel good sensation transpiring from this sweet couple Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are forming. I could feel they shared some complicity even if I found out they were not very friendly to each other during the shooting but at the end they made it work.There is no wonder this movie achieved a huge success and if you have the romantic fiber as I do, you will certainly cry especially at the end.",10,1,2,22 February 2016
Dead Poets Society," Captain Oh My Captain
","This movie is a pure masterpiece. I knew I was going to cry during this movie but I didn't expect such emotions going through me. It's all about emotions as how poetry should be. In fact this picture is a poem all by itself. Like Poetry, it celebrates life and love before anything else. Robin Williams, like a true poet, drives his students and by them, us through what this art represents:not just a question of rhymes and rhythm but life and pleasure. 'We will be worm food whatever happens to us so let's enjoy life till it's still time or Carpe Diem', That's all the Dead Poet Society is all about: celebrate life.It's also an ode about the beauty of education and the strong relationship between the students and the teacher. Robin Williams is the teacher who tries and thinks outside the box bringing an entire new dimension to his lectures. He's also treating his students as equal and let them bring life to the course. All the young actors playing the students are also marvelous and so powerful just like their captain Williams is.This is the kind of movie I so wish to see more often these days. The kind of movies which means something and shares emotions to the people watching it. The kind of movie which will stay in the memory and will never fade away. This is Dead Poets Society one of my ever favorite movies. And also an incredible tribute to the talent and the man named Robin Williams. I sure gonna missing this truly talented actor.",10,0,0,24 February 2015
Home Alone," My favorite Holiday Movie
",If there is one movie I would never miss during the holidays it would be Home Alone.It is hilarious and sweet as the same time. Macaulay Culkin is so adorable as this resourceful little child who was left alone by his own family and had to defend his house against two resilient clumsy burglars who preyed on his home while trying to cope with his situation of a 8 years old boy home alone.All the gags are hitting their mark it is absolutely joyful to see Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern falling in each trap set up by Kevin. But it is also so sweet to follow Kevin trying to act like a man for example when he used aftershave and he screams because it burns. I find this so cute.Home Alone is a marvelous Holidays movie all the family can enjoy. The children will love it as do the parents.,8,0,0,23 December 2015
Spotlight," The reason why we should never surrender our Freedom of the press
","Spotlight is a movie which is making you realize how dearly we should never surrender our freedom of the press.This movie tells the real story of a team of 5 journalists working for the Boston Globe who, despite the deep willingness of the Church and their supporters to bury it, uncovers one of the biggest scandals which shook the entire planet: the scandalous and systematic cover up of priests molesting young children they were in charge of by the Catholic Church itself.It all started with one case, then thirteen until it reached the chilling number of ninety priests molesting children during their entire career while people knew but turned their eyes because of all the good the Church was doing for the city.I was deeply shocked by the hypocrisy and real stiffness of this system for example when Rachel McAdams is interviewing that priest who admits the facts he's accused of but insists that it was not rape as he was raped himself. When the interview ended, while she walks down the stairs, she realizes that the priest lives nearby a school. What's even more shocking is the reaction of the Church towards the issue. They surely know of it but prefer to cover it up by hiding legal documents proving the rapes so nobody could gain access to it with the providential help of justice employees or even by frequently putting pressure on the journalists to protect the Church reputation.This movie is also an ode to reporting throughout those 5 journalists who keep digging, tracking down each of the victims to get their chilling statements even risking some hardly gained friendships with defense attorneys to get to the truth. My compliment by the way to Jamey Sheridan who played one of those attorneys who was just doing his job despite being secretly disgusted by his clients abuses.Spotlight is a must see and it truly deserves its Oscar for the Best Picture of the year. And it deserves also the highest note to me. 10/10",10,3,5,29 February 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," Nice try
","Being an avid Tintin fan since my childhood and admiring Steven Spielberg's work, I was really eager to discover this movie and I wasn't deceived.Visually, the movie is very enjoyable to see. It's looking like real characters while it's an animation movie. The Unicorn ship is a pure beauty. Concerning the plot, I was disturbed at first because it's not the story I read in the comic books but I have to say that the events are really combining well giving the story some sense. A few characters are missing but I didn't expect them to appear like Professeur Tournesol. Maybe we'll enjoy to see him in the next sequel.The only thing I maybe complain about is the tempo which is a bit low. Some moments are really sleepy and boring. But in overall, it's a nice try and a great tribute to Herge legacy.",8,0,0,23 February 2015
Ocean's Twelve," I feel lost
","After watching Ocean's eleven, I was eager to see what's Twelve has in store for me. I was expecting something of the same vein with the crew planning another one big score but against someone else as ruthless as Andy Garcia who could get back in the picture to make the things trickier.But I am quite deceived and I feel lost. The casting is still here, Europe is certainly a nice change of setting, Steven Soderbergh is still the director but this movie lacks a story. Why did they think that multiplying the heists would make this movie better than the first one? Did they run out of ideas? And please can someone explain me how they could have made the antagonist so weak and cheesy after the Great Andy Garcia?No offense against Vincent Cassel who is a great actor but it seems so cliché. Is it because he's French that he succeeded to bypass that laser field dancing the tango? I have seen some of the movies he starred in including one called the Hate. In it he's ruthless and very dark. He inspires fear. In Ocean Twelve, it's almost if we would laugh at his face! I also have some doubts about Catherine Zeta-Jones character. She is supposed to be an honest cop. Someone who truly believes in her duty to arrest criminals and thieves but still at the end she's becoming a part of the team? Please!Oh and one last thing, Europol has never been an investigative agency. It's not the European FBI. They are just sharing expertise and information to police forces throughout the EU. They don't investigate and certainly not borrow entire services and resources to their own benefit. This is beyond silly. At least do some research before writing the script.",5,1,2,10 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Enjoyable to see even if there is room for improvement.
","I am a big fan of the Star Wars Saga. It brought me to another world and each of the movies except maybe the last one is an unforgettable experience.Attack of the Clones is no exception. I like this movie and I find it very enjoyable to see. It has its good points as it also has its bad ones.If there is something I particularly like in this prequel trilogy, it's the fact that it allows us to discover new incredible worlds. I already knew about the majesty of Naboo but that region of the Southern Lakes is just breathtaking with those falls, this mountainous landscape. A perfect set for the romantic scenes of the movie.Speaking of which, I really like the love story between Anakin and Padme. People says that it's cheesy and boring but as I'm a romantic type, I fall for it. I find it so beautiful and heartwarming to see those two young adults surely falling in love like in a fairy tale with those gracious lakes as a landscape. It's smoothed, soft so far away from the incoming war which is about to break out.Now about that plot, I find it is a bit too much. I find it very obtuse to discover that an army of clones was secretly prepped to serve the Republic. This army seems to fell from the sky especially at the time when the Republic needs it the most. And it's huge enough to sustain the entire war effort. My take is it should have been introduced in a more subtle way. It's a little too convenient to my taste.I would like to focus now on the new character introduced into the movie: Count Dooku starred by the late Christopher Lee. He is powerful, charismatic, mischievous and very manipulative. He was a gifted Jedi, shares a special bond with Obi Wan as he was the mentor of Qui-Gon Jin during his early years and he became a Sith Lord turning on his former allies. Seeing him confront the Jedi would have been such a delight which brings me to one of my main issues with the movie.As both Obi-Wan, Anakin and Dooku are powerful Force users, I expected an amazing duel between the three. It should have been spectacular and powerful but it's far from it. It's kinda lazy and acted out. To compare with it, the fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin on Episode 3 was far more interesting and enjoyable to watch. I don't know why it's that so. I would love to understand. Only the fight between Yoda and Dooku caught my entire attention.The music is really great as usual and again it shows how much talented is John Williams and his orchestra. It's really a perfect match to the mood of every scenes. John Williams deserves so much praise and at least an Oscar for his amazing work. It's so unfair that he hasn't been already awarded by the Prestigious Academy.So I give it a 6 for the scenery, the score, the romance and Count Dooku. It's enjoyable to see but it could have been much better anyway.",6,1,2,23 May 2016
The Bourne Ultimatum," Such an amazing saga
","Jason Bourne doesn't deceive. Here he comes once again for the third time, trying to survive as he's still chased by his ex-employers.This third installment is as good as the two first movies. Jason Bourne is a magnet and watching him tormenting the CIA and exact his revenge for the life he lost is still exciting and masterfully shot.Matt Damon is once again amazing as Jason Bourne, this CIA assassin who wants to start over. It's no longer a quest for his past. It's about redemption for all the crimes he committed for the CIA and put down the monster by revealing its dark secrets. Which makes him the biggest threat to the CIA who is more than willing to end it definitely.So here we go again following Jason throughout the world from Moscow to New York while stopping at Paris, Amsterdam and Tanger, taking down the assassins sent after him and his allies to his final destination where everything began for him.The rest of the cast is as great as Matt Damon especially David Strathairn who plays the main villain in the movie. He's so cold blooded and despicable he's giving me chills at each of his scenes. So does Albert Finney who plays Dr Hirsch, the one who conditioned Bourne and turned him into a cold blooded killer. Those two are great additions to the cast alongside Julia Stiles and Joan Allen.Please give us more!",9,1,1,23 February 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," Chills through my spine!
","OMG I can't say how much hyped I am right now. As a huge Queen and Freddie fan, I have been waited for years to finally see that movie. And I did yesterday!All I can say is WOW! This movie got me chills throughout my spine especially the Live Aid reenactment which left me in awe completely mesmerized! It was just perfect and if I was already envying the very blessed ones who had the chance to see that performance live, I do it even more this morning! If Freddie would still be among us today, he would have loved Bohemian Rhapsody!I have to thank Rami Malek for his amazing performance as Freddie. He was just above great throughout the movie. He's truly worth an Oscar for it as he nailed it. I already loved him as Snafu in the Pacific but him as Freddie is from another level. The actors who played the rest of the band were as great especially the one playing Brian. I couldn't distinguish him from the original as they share a striking resemblance. Lucy Boynton is so gracious as Mary, Freddie's love of his life. Joseph Mazzello gave me another image of John as the real one was so reserved and shy and we see him in the movie joking even sometimes taking the lead. That was refreshing. Ben Hardy was also awesome as Roger Taylor and I could feel that even if he clashed a lot with Freddie in the movie, he cared deeply about him.Now of course you have the music. I don't want to break the magic as it was obvious they used the real Freddie's recordings to match Rami's game which itself is quite a performance. But Rami had some chances to sing in real and he has a pretty good voice. Maybe he should start a singer career when he's done with acting.But again the real big moment of this movie is the Live Aid at the very end and this movie deserves the biggest praise just for those final moments as it's just pure bliss! I have chills throughout the performance and I had the feeling I was back in time watching the Queen Epic performance that day right in the Stadium! That was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I don't want to spoil the moment but trust me it's something you're gonna love as it shows the true power and aura of Freddie Mercury. I'm pretty sure younger people will love to see the real performance back home from the theater!On another note, sure the sexuality of Freddie is mentioned several times in the movie and you see Rami kissing guys a time or two but it was never a center part of the movie. Actually it's more focused on his love story with Mary even when they broke up. Aids is mentioned too but not in the negative way as it actually brought the very good of Freddie as he decided to focus the last years of his life to Music and Rock'n'roll and give his best no matter what!So Go see that movie it will blow your mind! And if it doesn't get an Oscar wave this year, I will lose my trust to Hollywood.",10,2,3,4 November 2018
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," I truly miss you Robin
","About 3 years ago, a true comic gem decided to leave us far earlier than we expected. He made us laughing so much we never imagine that behind that love for life, there was a much darker hidden side which ultimately took him from us. That man was Robin Williams.One of the characters he'll be always remembered for is without a doubt the radio host he incarnated in Good Morning Vietnam. This role was made for him as he could show his tremendous comic and acting talent. The fact that the scenes when he's hosting his radio show are all improvised is speaking volumes of the huge sense of imagination and comedy Robin has displayed throughout his career. But he can also show that he could be a very dramatic actor as well. The scene when he comes back to the radio station after witnessing the bar bombing is truly heartbreaking especially when you see him all alone completely down while the rest of the world keeps going on and the machines are getting frenzy.But it would be unfair to not cheer the rest of the cast who is supporting Robin so greatly especially Forrest Whittaker as Private Garlick, Tung Than Tran as Tuan, Bruno Kirby as Lt Hauk and J.T. Walsh as Sgt Major Dickerson.The latter is particularly distasteful as this very rigid Sergeant who is managing the radio station in Saigon. He's the true antagonist of the movie as he sees Adrian Cronauer as an uncontrollable burden and he's trying to get rid of him with any means necessary including sending Adrian on an assignment in an area controlled by the Viet-Cong.The late Bruno Kirby is bringing a second source of comic relief as this goofy lieutenant who is acting as Adrian direct supervisor boasting about his own comic genius which is in fact truly dreadful. There are some very memorable scenes he's a part of which are truly funny though.What I also like in this movie is they are not showing the Vietnamese people as the bad guys. They are displayed as a poor and rejected people with a true sense of friendship and humor willing to share the beauties of their culture to the Americans. The last scene when they are sharing a baseball game with Adrian before he goes back to Washington is truly moving.All of this is making this movie a gem and Robin Williams is bringing it among the stars. God bless your soul Robin.",8,1,1,12 May 2017
The Bourne Identity," So thrilling
","When we talk about spy movies, we always think first about James Bond or Mission Impossible. We think gadgets, supermodel lovers, lavish glamour and the top edged super car each one of us would love to get an hand onto.But the Bourne saga is so much different. We don't have any of these. We just have a man, Jason Bourne, struck by amnesia after being found in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, shot and unconscious. A man who tries to find out who he is and how he got there. A man who is also trying to escape from a bunch of mysterious assassins relentlessly tracking him down to kill him and Marie, the woman who's helping him despite her in his quest, showing his unsuspected unarmed combat skills to survive.And we have a lot of action too, efficient and very enjoyable to see. Each of the combat scenes is really thrilling and so is that car chase throughout Paris. It's so well executed and you don't need anything more to keep us entertained.The story itself is thrilling as we follow Jason and Marie throughout their journey from Zurich to Paris, watching them getting really close to each other while trying to stay alive facing those CIA assassins. Of course there is no doubt that Jason is a CIA assassin himself but that's not what causes the thrill. Watching them trying to survive is what makes us so attached and completely in.The leading couple, Matt Damon and Franka Potente, are truly awesome in their respective parts. Matt is mysterious and cold. He's not much more different from the killers he takes down but he's opening himself with Franka who plays that ordinary woman coping with his own problem but whose life changes forever when she accepts to bring Bourne to Paris with her Austin Mini and help him in his quest. We are so far from the supermodel and the super car for sure.But that's something we should look for: realism. Those gadgets and the glamour is cool but so superficial. Jason and Marie are much more like us besides the lethal and instinctive skills of Jason of course. We're feeling so much more attached to them and this is one of the movie's strengths. Maybe that's what pushed the James Bond creators to rethink their copy and deliver us Casino Royale.",9,1,1,19 February 2017
Bridge of Spies," Another masterpiece from Spielberg/Hanks
","Who said that a thriller has to be violent to be considered as successful? Bridge of Spies is a smart movie about the Gary Powers affair, a dramatic event which could have become the spark of a destructive conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.Despite what the title may suggest, Bridge of Spies is not a movie about espionage. Don't expect to see thrilling chases, firefights or anything we could see in James Bond or Mission Impossible. This movie is about the real story of the efforts of one man, Jim Donovan, a Brooklyn lawyer specialized in insurance issues, who became involved in spite of himself in the most sensitive crisis of that time and, by using his negotiating skills, is trying to settle peacefully the crisis by organizing an exchange between Powers and a Soviet spy who was arrested prior to the crash of the U2.Once again, Tom Hanks is playing with perfection this role of a man who put his reputation, his life and his family's in line by defending a Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (played admirably by Mark Rylance) because he truly believes that anybody, whatever the charges are against him or her, deserves the right to be defended.Mark Rylance is also perfect impersonating Rudolf Abel. His performance is very sober and I have some sympathy for the character. As Donovan says in the movie, Abel is just a loyal soldier of his country and he should not be branded as a traitor as many did back in that time.But what gives to this movie all its credits is its sobriety and objectivity depicting the tension between the two sides back in that era, the hypocrisy of both judicial system including ours who wants the world to be considered as a model of justice but in reality are ready to deny the values of our country by violating the Constitution and depriving Abel of his basic right to defend himself.There are some scenes who literally broke my heart. I had tears watching Jim's son filling the bathtub of water because in school he learned that the first basic needs which couldn't be able to be fulfilled in case of a nuclear bombardment will be electricity and water or when those two people got shot to death while trying to climb the Berlin wall and escape the oppressive Soviet regime. I looked up and it turned out that more than 200 people were gunned down trying to escape including women.So yes maybe some would have preferred an action movie but for the ones who prefers a realistic recalling of the facts like myself will really appreciate this picture. We need more movies like Bridges of spies. Movies who can give you a realistic insight of what was going on. In that matter Bridge of spies is accomplishing its mission very perfectly.",10,2,4,23 February 2016
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Tom Cruise still got it
","I didn't have the chance to see Rogue Nation to the theater so when it was available on YouTube I jumped on the occasion.I have to say that MI5 is still as entertaining as the previous movies. It is still focused on the fun and action rather than the story. There are still a lot of explosions, a lot of spectacular crashes and the handsome Tom Cruise is still looking for more extreme stunts.I would say there are some inconsistencies especially seeing Tom Cruise and his team without a scratch not even a torn shirt while they literally go through a lot of trouble. The biggest example is that car chase which ends up in a spectacular crash with the car rolling over between the trunk and the hood endlessly and when it finally stops, you see Tom Cruise and Simon Pegg saying to Jeremy Renner and Vingh Rhimes 'hey guys how are you going?'. While Renner and Rhimes are joking around with Pegg while getting him out of the wreck, Tom, apparently not shaken, take the bike of one of the bad guys and continue the chase! I agree it is fun and cool but really not realistic. In the real world, you would be dead or at least in a wheelchair. Here there is not even a scratch! Real supermen solid like a rock. They would be in a crashing plane, you would see them walking around carrying several victims on their back. With no scratches on them of course.So That's why I find it less interesting than Spectre. It is enjoyable to see but it is far from being as deep as the current 007 saga at least concerning the plot. But I liked it anyway. I certainly had a good time watching Rogue Nation.",7,0,2,24 November 2015
The Fast and the Furious," Cars, speed, babes, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker
","Some would love this movie, others wouldn't but you can deny The Fast and The Furious started a trend which is still on going today. Never Street Racing has been so popular since this movie came out.The street races are beautifully done and care had been applied to get the audience feeling the power and the adrenaline the pilots must feel behind the wheel of those road beasts full of NOS. There is no need to say that this is the signature of the entire series. Whatever the plot is, there is always a street race going on and each one of them is masterfully shot and scripted. This series is first of all a tribute to the cars and the driving skills of their pilots.The other asset of this movie are Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. The first one is playing Dominic Torretto, all in muscle respected and regarded as the leader of the entire LA racing community. Like her sister Mia says, everyone is attracted and orbits around Dom. Paul Walker is Brian O'Conner a promising undercover cop tasked to bring down Torretto and his team. He is definitely cute, bold and has racing in his blood. This duo are bearing the movie on their shoulders. When one is missing it has not the same impact.",7,0,1,4 October 2015
Ocean's Eleven," Fun, jouissive and very cool
","Yesterday I decided to buy the Ocean trilogy regrouping Ocean's eleven, Ocean's twelve and Ocean's thirteen. I have already watched and enjoyed the first one a long time ago so when I saw it available for purchase on Google play for only $24,99, I didn't hesitate to buy the bundle.I don't regret my purchase. I watched the first movie and I got hooked immediately. The script is not very deep. It's one of those stories about one guy, Danny Ocean, an ex con who just got out of prison on parole and who decides to get back the woman he always loved, Tess, in add of robbing the man she loves now, the very rich and ruthless owner of the three biggest casinos of Las Vegas. In order to do that, he assembled a very typical crew which we follow in the preparation and execution of this very risky job.The main force of this movie is the cast which is very glamour and cool. George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and Andy Garcia among others are bringing their touch to the movie and it produces a lot of appeal. We could imagine their ego to take the best of them but actually the alchemy between them works as magic. They are funny, the movie is not violent at all and there are memorable lines throughout the movie.Then you have Las Vegas and its ambiance of constant party, where money is pouring out everywhere in a very lavish style. As the main setting of the plot, Vegas is a character on its own and it's very beautiful to see especially at night.The music is also very matching the general mood of the flick. It's jazzy and enjoyable to hear. It adds to the general feeling that Ocean's Eleven is a polished movie with a glamorous cast and an entertaining story.Now it's time for me to go watch the second movie, Ocean's twelve, which should be as good as this very nice intro. I'm giving an A.",8,1,2,9 December 2016
Pearl Harbor," Alert! This is a raid on history accuracy! This is no drill!
","You heard me people! If you're an history buff looking for authenticity , this movie is not for you.Indeed, it seems obvious that making an history movie was not the intention of Michael Bay at all. Many of the historical facts of that dreadful day have been overlooked or deliberately tweaked. I can cite the Eagle squadron, the one Rafe flew with during the battle of Britain , which is pure fiction or the fact that both heroes are able to switch from fighter pilots to Bomber ones in a blink of an eye which was a good one. So if you are only looking for authenticity, I should suggest you to watch movies like Tora!Tora!Tora! instead which are far more accurate.But it has also its moments and besides those flaws, this movie is very entertaining and enjoyable to see. Some of the scenes will glue yourself to your seat with their beautiful shots and action. The Attack on the fleet itself is masterfully done for example. The 30 minutes long part is truly breathtaking both visually and orally. Michael Bay is a master in this area and he proves it once again with that masterpiece. It has now become a classic on YouTube and it's deserved.Now as a romantic girl, I couldn't help myself being moved by the love story between the characters. Sure the dialogues are more than cheesy sometimes but it's touching anyway and will make you smile. It's also not the most original story I've ever seen but it's entertaining and enjoyable to see so who cares! I remember crying at the end of the movie especially the last scene which was heartbreaking. So leave the history out and enjoy the movie. It may not be the perfect flick but it's not a bad one neither. If you are forgiving about the historic mishaps, you will like it.",6,0,1,19 October 2017
Quantum of Solace," Good movie which could have been much better
","2 years after Casino Royale, a movie I really enjoyed from start to finish, I was quite eager to discover the new 007 opus. My first overall impression is that despite being a good movie, I have a feeling of an incomplete film.I was expecting much more from Quantum of Solace especially as the direct sequel of Casino Royale. While the latter was very well built and actually makes a lot of sense, Quantum seems disorganized and too much fast-paced for my taste. Sure there is a lot of action but I would have hoped that the director would let us discover another psychological side of James Bond especially after the death of the woman he loved and for who he was ready to leave MI6. But Instead, there's nothing but revenge, gunfight, explosions, fistfights. I was lost between all of that.That said, I have to say that there are still things which don't deserve to go straight to the trash. The main one is again Daniel Craig. Despite a very basic script which focuses on raw force more than anything else, he still manages to share the emotion of a grieving and angry man, who is driven by revenge but still wants to understand why the woman he loved so much betrayed him. 007 lives through Daniel Craig and he's a blessing to this movie. I would have wished the rest of the cast would be as good but it's far from that except the too rare Lady Judi Dench. I can't give more than 6 out of 10 because this movie is just incomplete.",6,0,5,3 June 2015
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," One of the best movie I've seen in 2011
","The Mission Impossible series has always been captivating and entertaining. This last settlement is not an exception to this rule. This movie is efficient entertaining and keep us involved from the beginning to the end.The first reason we should love this movie is the high chemistry and performance of the casting. It's the first movie without Luther Stickell who just made a small appearance at the end of the picture. We see new faces alongside Tom Cruise. Jeremy Renner is taking Ving Rhymes as Tom Cruise unexpected wingman, firstly introduced as a simple analyst but in real is a much more capable agent who we can see the potential being revealed throughout the movie. Next is the amazing Simon Pegg as the team hacker and gadget specialist which had a small role in MI3 and is now in first line. He is bringing a great touch of humor and seeing him as a full part cast is refreshing. And at last Paula Patton, a very capable agent who doubts her abilities after she lost one of her agents she was in love to during a previous mission.And of course, there is Tom Cruise which is the only survivor of the previous installments. He is less bold than in the previous movies but a lot smarter. He still do some incredible stunts like when he climbs the Burj Kalifa in Dubai with a pair of magnetic gloves. This is the kind of stunt only him has the secret. It gives vertigo as we follow him climbing the floors. He is still sexy as hell and again the main asset of the movie. It was also touching to see him and his wife exchanging a smile while seeing each other. We can feel there is still love between them and I had a small tear seeing that scene.But the villains are also awesome most specifically Lea Seydoux who under her sweet angel appearance is a cold blooded assassin without any remorse and feelings. She gives chills during each of her scenes and we can see Lea is a very talented actress. I can't wait to see her in Spectre which will be released at the end of the year. The main villain is not as impressive but still do the job. Maybe a switch would have been welcomed.Once again the locations chosen for the movie are really amazing and really powerful. Ghost Protocol bring us to the Kremlin, a strong and cold place, home to the Russian Ministry of Defense, a perfect place for a spy movie. Then we leave Moscow for the Burj Kalifa and Dubai, a skyscrapers city in the middle of the desert as one of the highest building in the world being used for a breathtaking stunt ever seen. And at last Mumbai in India which is also so enjoyable to see with those Hindu dancers, those nice cars.... That also why I love those kind of movies. They allow us to see places we've never been to and its great.At least lets talk about the story line. Despite the fact that it's not the first time a plot about nuclear weapons being stolen and used to attack the US is chosen as a main plot, it's still entertaining and captivating. Mostly because Tom Cruise and his team are performing without the back up of IMF to stop that threat. The gadgets, while present, are not really working well. The only thing bringing the team to successfully accomplish the mission is the team skills and unity. A team who can have some failures but is not allowed to fail that very mission in order to save the world from a nuclear war and clear IMF.In conclusion, I give it a 9 out of Ten and I strongly recommend to watch this amazing movie at least once.",9,2,3,10 September 2015
Frozen," It deserves to be considered as a classic
","When it comes to talk about Disney movies we always have in mind wonderful stories like Cinderella, Snow White, the Little Mermaid or Bambi. Frozen deserves to join this list of classics.The story is so sweet and full of good feelings throughout it. There is a lot of love, each of the character are very attaching on their own. And most of all, it has this magic and fairy spirit which will enchanted the children eyes and will bring us adults back into childhood. When it comes to a period like Christmas, such feeling is a delight.I also loved the songs, all fitting perfectly to the script and the scenes mood. Songs included in the movies is one of the finest tradition of the Disney Movies Spirit. You don't see that perfect execution nowhere else.The animations are one of the best I have seen. The water effect, the snow flying around. Everything seems so smooth and sweet. It is really well done and close to the perfection we could see in the Pixar movies. Anna, Elsa and Christoph are perfectly modeled. All their movements seems so real. Such a great effort for a very sweet delight for the eyes.You will love it if you like fairy tales and kept a child spirit. The other well will maybe look the other way.",9,3,9,24 December 2015
Schindler's List," Righteous among the nations
","The Holocaust has been one of the most awful and tragic event of the History of humanity. It will always remain a stain in our legacy, a true proof of how despicable and monstrous we, the human race, can be.That's the main reason why the Schindler's List should be praised. It goes far beyond the cast, the awards, the revenue it produced. This movie has been made so we cannot forget and repeat the same atrocities. While more and more survivors of this tragedy are passing away, taking with them their testimonies and there are still people who dare ignoring that those events truly happened, The Schindler's list and its message will always remain for everyone to see.So I won't review the movie like a simple piece of art. Sure Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley are awesome in that movie and they sure each should have received a so well deserved award for their performance but that's not the most important. The only fact that they are part of this movie should make them proud. If through it, they could help prevent that such horrible tragedies like the Holocaust happen again and save millions of lives in the process, it's definitely worthier than any Oscar or Golden Globe on your shelves! So thank you Steven, Liam, Ralph, Ben and everyone who made this movie a reality. Let your message be spread and shared from generations to generations. So we could never forget and say never again!",10,9,13,22 January 2017
The Bourne Legacy," mhmm
","The Bourne Legacy is some kind of an alien. It's somehow related to the Bourne general story and use the same mechanics of the movies.But still there is that feeling of something not really needed. A movie which has been made to keep us entertained while waiting for the real Bourne to come back and as such doesn't bring nothing new to the general plot.I wish it could have been different even if it's still entertaining thanks to the cast general performance. Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton are carrying the movie on their shoulders, keeping it afloat.But this won't change the fact that the script never achieved to really take off and keep us in like the first 3 movies did. The 3 previous movies were served by a script which was always focused on realism. A story about a man struck by amnesia willing to find out who he is only to discover that he's a CIA assassin and he became a high valued liability making him a priority target for his ex-employer.But here it's about one of those CIA recruits, some kind of chemically enhanced super soldier who tries to survive when the CIA decides to shut down the very program he was part of because of Bourne's actions. It seems already weird to see that guy swallowing those mysterious pills and bring some gibberish about it but it becomes clearly out of touch when he has to face that super assassin who would be more fit in Terminator rather than this. What's that? I give a 6 for the cast but besides that, it's definitely not worth the saga.",6,2,4,23 February 2017
The Longest Day," A very special movie
","As my great grandfather was one of the many men who participated to this historic and epic event, this movie has always been very special to me and my family.Each time my great grandfather was watching or even discussing this movie, all his memories of that day as well as all the relationship he had with great friends he lost on that dirty beach came through. The moments of happiness, the tension becoming stronger each day waiting for big battle, the fear of dying or losing the strangers you learned to know and respect throughout the intense training. This movie had a very special resonance to him and he was very thankful that such a movie was released and even more he was proud that the director didn't take on any side because the Germans were as afraid and respectful towards the men they faced.Now when I watched this movie, it makes me remember of my great grandfather who was one of those heroes, one of what we called the greatest generation. He had the chance to survive this day and the battle which followed and claimed even more lives. So it has also a very special place to my heart. We should never forget their sacrifice and be careful to not repeat the same mistake which led to WW2.",10,2,4,1 December 2015
Lincoln," Daniel Day Lewis, the reincarnation of the best President of our History
","I am not particularly a political movie fan but this one particularly touched my heart.This is not a biography of Abe, let's be clear on that point immediately. This movie is focused on a particular part of his life, the most defined moment of his Presidency: the ratification of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery in the United States of America.So this is about the debate and the multiple manipulations and negotiations leading to this decisive and historical vote. But this is also a movie about Abraham Lincoln and his tireless will to abolish slavery and end the Civil War which is tearing the country apart for 4 years, claiming thousands of victims including his eldest son who died in the very first years of the conflict.I have to say that you couldn't find any finest actor than Daniel Day Lewis to incarnate Old Honest Abe. His performance is literally mesmerizing. I had the impression to see the real Abraham Lincoln throughout the movie and this is actually the sign of the greatest actors in the business. He is very sober but still remains impressive. His performance deserves praise and recognition. We don't see much of Daniel Day Lewis but we are not judging the talent of an actor or an actress by the number of movies he/she appears but by how his/her performances in each of the movies they did appear is touching each one of us and make it unforgettable. On this second point Daniel had proved how a legendary talent he is.The rest of the cast is following his path by performing in the right tone and attitude. Tommy Lee Jones is really awesome as Rep Thaddeus Stevens who is despising slavery as much as Lincoln and who is married to a black woman. Tommy is also a great actor and he can play everything to perfection. Having him and Daniel together is certainly the best asset of this movie.I think this movie is one of my favorites and I will have the pleasure to watch it again. If you haven't seen it yet you should.",8,2,3,17 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," This trilogy should be left forever forgotten
","I had high hopes for this trilogy. I was definitely wishing it would level up with the other episodes. Sure the prequel trilogy wasn't as perfect as the original one but it was still very watchable and entertaining.When Force Awakens was released, I was disappointed but I was willing to give that trilogy another chance. When Rogue One was released, I was even more enthusiastic but then came the Last Jedi....Let's be honest: this trilogy is dead. There's no way you can save it as Ryan Johnson blew it into oblivion. The most mind blowing is it wasn't supposed to be that way as JJ Abrams was initially the one in charge once again. His first movie was far from perfect but at least he left us with a momentum, if correctly exploited, could have given us one great episode.But what we didn't expect was Ryan Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy hijacking that movie to turn it into a feminist platform at the price of EVERYTHING else.Don't bother if the story doesn't stand, if our beloved characters are trashed alongside their legacy or if there is a large dose of childish humor which is making everyone facepalming.And please don't care about the millions of fans who came to see the movie full of expectation, who passed the last two years fomenting plots in their own mind hoping the movie would give the answer they wished to hear!Forget about all the rules and story frame set by the previous movies. All of it has vanished in the blink of an eye. Now you can destroy starships by ramming them at light speed, shoot missiles at a shielded bridge and a hangar and still blow it into piece. Now space is full of oxygen and gravity, enabling Leia into transforming herself as Mary Poppins and fly down to her command ship bridge which was destroyed a few seconds ago.And most of all, now you can have Rey. A female nobody who is as perfect as you could ever be. She can shoot down 3 tie fighters in one single shot despite never shooting a gun turret before, teach a lesson to the great Jedi master Luke Skywalker about hope and resilience (yeah we're talking about the one who achieved to turn his own evil father because he saw a spark of good hidden deeply within his dad), move a mountain of rocks without training etc. If you wish to get some answers about where her tremendous power comes from, forget it as you'll get none. As far as I'm concerned, she's the very definition of a Mary Sue and this movie engraved her legacy as such into stone.Talking about useless characters, let's chat about Holdo and Rose. The first one is a purple haired female who achieved to reach the position of an admiral despite nothing to show for. Her only background is some obscure battle nobody heard of. We don't know anything about it nor whatever accomplishment she may have done to deserve such promotion. Her skills sucks as her poor decisions mainly leads to the destruction of the Resistance fleet. She's the one scolding Poe, who we were able to see how talented and brave he is throughout TFA, just because he wants to know more about her plans which push him to take the matters on his own hand which makes the situation only worse. But at the end she's the one who is right and somehow Poe is ridiculed. Talk about ridicule.Rose, on her hand, well I don't really understand why she's in that movie because she has no purpose except taking the light off Finn. I liked Finn in the first movie, he made me remembering of Han Solo as he always seems to head into trouble but always finds a way to get out of it with a lot of luck and well some braveness. There was a lot of potential to exploit about him but like Poe with Holdo, he's nothing but the sidekick of that little chubby Asian woman who is more irritating than anything else. The worst is when Finn finally decides to be a hero and is about to sacrifice his own life to save the Resistance, Rose suddenly appears to thwart his attempt, crashing down into his pod then when asked about why did she do that, she only answer that love is everything at the end. While she's giving him the kiss, the door protecting the resistance is blown away taking away all its hope of survival. I was sinking in my seat when I watched this, facepalming all around!Besides all that, the main story is nothing but a boring pointless chase without any event. There's nothing to put you on the edge of your seat, just two big turtle ships slowly moving away from each other.Yes this is not Star Wars anymore and this whole trilogy should be put to rest and forgotten. It has turned into an horrible joke and it's sad and very heartbreaking.If I have a advice for you, It would be to just keep focusing on the two previous trilogies alongside Rogue One which is not that bad. Those seven movies are the REAL Star Wars. About that sham of a trilogy, you should just forget it even pretend it doesn't exist. If you have already watched it, try to erase it from your memory.

Mission: Impossible II," More entertaining but less captivating
","As this movie is a sequel, it would be very hard to not succumb to the temptation of comparing MI2 with the first installment of the series. Personally thinking, I much prefer the first one which was deep and kept me in throughout the story. This one is more raw and gives much less space to brains.The biggest fault is the plot which is as most basic as we can get. This is all about stunts and shooting. While it's beautifully shot with slow motions and fireworks, leave your brain home because the storyline is inexistent and we already know who are the good and bad guys since the very first scene of the movie. Brian De Palma had the good taste of keeping the suspense to the very end, revealing who was the real bad guys at the very last scenes. But here there is no suspense. We all know how this gonna end. This is a John Woo movie and Brain movies are not really his style. This cost him the 4 points.But Mr Woo is also an expert on action staging and this is what saved this movie. The action scenes are beautifully shot, a lot of them in slow motion which is one of the pillars of John Woo style. Those make the movie quite enjoyable to see. The pace is high and keeps us entertained. The locations are breathtaking (Grand Canyon, Sevilla and Australia). With John Woo, everything is focused on the visual and MI2 is not an exception to this rule. The casting performance is not that bad either even if Ethan Hunt lost a lot of personality between the two movies.So here it is. I give it a 6 out of 10 which is not a bad mark but not an excellent one either. I would have wished this movie to be smarter but John Woo sacrificed it for fun which is not a bad idea if you want to enjoy a nice moment at the theater but is if you wish your movie to be remembered.",6,1,2,10 September 2015
World Trade Center," For all the Heroes
","As we celebrate today the 14th anniversary of this horrible tragedy, I decided to watch World Trade Center which recall the real stories of John McLaughlin and William Jimeno, two Port Authority police officers caught in the middle of the disaster and survived it after several hours stuck in the rumbles.This movie is really moving and make us proud to be American. Just like this US Marine who decided to fly from Connecticut to help for the search of survivors or this ex paramedic who came to rescue Will and finally save his life.This was an awful day but we saw the best of us coming through getting together as a Nation to rise up from the chaos.Because this is what this movie is about. It's about not giving up, fight for the people we cherish the most despite the horrific situation we have to face. It's simply about life. There are other movies about 9/11 including Flight 93 to make us remember about the awesome bravery of all those people who sacrificed their life to save others. World Trade Center is for all the Heroes from law enforcement and NYFD who went there to rescue people and for some of them lost their life in the process.So to all, thank you for all you did for your sacrifice. This movie is for you. God bless you.",10,2,4,11 September 2015
Invictus," So moving and inspiring
","Nelson Mandela will always be a role model. He had so much compassion for the people around him. He believed in the Human being that we are able to elevate ourselves and accomplish things we thought we could never be able to. The power of the Human will, the Power of We when we come together to achieve a common goal.Invictus is making him justice and is such an awesome tribute to this great man nicknamed Madiba. I cried a lot during this movie I still do each time I watch this awesome movie. In this world full of selfishness and violence, Invictus is like a fresh sunshine. There is no war no blood no violence. Just Unity, love, compassion and sport.Sport is a mean to achieve peace between us, something which brings us together and allows us to achieve great things. Mandela realized it and used his National Rugby Team, once a symbol of the Apartheid which torn up the country he cherished the most for such a long time, to bring his Nation together and win the World Cup. This event was just a way to achieve a greater goal and it worked.There would be no one better than Clint Eastwood, who as Mandela, is believing in the Human Being, to direct this awesome tribute. This movie is so enlightening, so moving, so inspiring it will make everyone cry of happiness and joy. It is also very sober, very simple only relying on the great talent of the actors to make a wonderful masterpiece.Morgan Freeman is just so impressive in the role of Nelson Mandela. He shows his aura throughout the movie and he is proving once again he is such an awesome actor who can make us feel beautiful emotions. He is one of the kind and I can't see no one else to impersonate such a powerful role model.Matt Damon is also awesome in playing Francois Pienaar the Springboks captain. He is inspiring in every scene he appears especially when he tries to tell his rugby fellow players that they are much worthier than they think they are. He is moving as he invited them to play and explain Rugby rules to young black kids in the ghettos surrounding Pretoria.So yes we definitely need to see more movies like this which we are able to see how awesome the Human Being can be. This movie brings something very beautiful and pushes us to believe in ourselves and to come together to achieve great things. It counterbalances selfishness and greed with replacing them with compassion and unity.So thank you so much Mr Mandela and Mr Eastwood for this awesome lesson of life. And may other will follow your path. x",10,1,2,28 September 2015
Mission: Impossible," The best Mission Impossible
","To me this is the best movie of the entire series for several reasons.First, unlike the 4 sequels, this thriller is more cerebral. There is less action and the story is holding up. There are maybe not many spectacular stunts but what it lacks about it is regained by the deepness of the characters. Tom Cruise is playing a manipulated man, betrayed by his own boss and who is resolved to get his reputation back by taking down the mastermind who killed his entire team to frame him. The suspense is present all the time and we discover the real villain at the very end of the movie.The second asset is the cast. You wouldn't expect better actors to star in this movie: Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Vingh Rhymes, Jean Reno, Kristin Scott Thomas. This is a five star casting and it serves the plot to the perfection. We're feeling a chemistry between those actors and they play their parts genuinely which was not sometimes the case during the sequels.The third good point is the directing and editing. It's dark and tense just like it should be. There is no time out sometimes we are lost but we always are able to keep up with the story thanks to the directing. I never felt out of the movie I was kept in and interested in. Not only because of Tom but mostly because it's so well shot, keeping us in the story. It's something the sequels lack. They are so focused on the action sometimes I'm wondering if some stunts are really necessary to the plot or it's only to satisfy Tom's ego. I would have wished the sequels would have kept the same spirit than Mission Impossible. Less action but more story instead of a stunts piling up to cover not such a good story.",8,1,1,12 August 2015
La La Land," The kind of movie we don't make anymore
","La La Land is one of a kind, a true gem I so wish we would be able to see more in theaters. It deserves the buzz and success it got and surely should have been awarded the Best Picture award at the last Oscar ceremony. They had it for a time until they finally gave it to a movie everyone barely knows. But that's OK as long as we the general public give the full success it deserves. And we do.So where should I start? There are so many assets in this movie I don't think 1,000 words would be enough.First the story is so well written. It's full of hope, love but most importantly, lightness. This movie is so carefree and poetic we're getting in another universe. That scene for example at the LA Observatory where Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are dancing among the stars gave me chills. I felt transported it was amazing and I remembered me and my companion holding each other hands tight as it was so powerful. La La Land is such a great tribute to the legacy of Hollywood and the musical genre in general.Emma Stone is Mia, a young small town girl who wishes to make a name in Hollywood like many other girls but is not achieving real success until she meets Sebastian, a carefree pianist who lives through Jazz and wish to open his own Jazz club to give the genre a second youth. Recognizing each other's talents, they fall in love and take together the path to stardom. Both actors are truly awesome in their part and they display such a great chemistry throughout the movie.Now I'm not a true fan of jazz but I love the spirit and the songs are matching perfectly the lightness displayed throughout the movie. City of Stars is my favorite so far. I love the dance scenes too including the very first one which get us straight to business. I'd so wish waiting in the LA traffic would be that fun :)That other one when Stone and Gosling are dancing on hilltop is making such a great tribute to the classic and no doubt it will become a classic soon too.Yes Damian Chazelle should be proud of his baby because we don't make that kind of movie anymore and it has nothing to envy from the classic oldies of the 1950s and 1960s.

Sicario," Crossing Borders
","There are movies which will taint you, which will bring you to the depths of the human nature and will make you wonder about Good and Evil.Sicario is a movie by the Canadian director Denis Villeneuve about a US Elite Task Force of CIA, FBI, DEA and Delta Force mandated by the Department of Defense to take down a violent and murderous Mexican Cartel responsible of the death of many innocent families both in Mexico and the US.Kate (Emily Blunt), a young and promising FBI SWAT team from Phoenix, Arizona, is hired to serve as liaison between the Task Force and the US Government. During the meeting, she meets the Agent in Charge, Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) who briefed her about the mission and the main objectives. But soon she realizes that the Task force is free of action and have no restraint about using force against the criminals they are supposed to take down.Along the way, she meets Matt's partner, Alejandro (The excellent Benicio del Toro), who introduces himself as a cartel 'expert'. He is rough, keeps on himself and very heart cold. Throughout the movie, we realize that in fact he's an assassin who is on a personal vendetta against the head of the cartel who ordered the horrible murders of his wife and daughter. The real purpose of the mission is to create a diversion to allow Alejandro to fulfill his revenge and assassinate the cartel leader and his family which at the end he did in cold blood.This movie is violent and this is not for everyone eyes to see. But it's intense and complex, making you wonder what's the border between good and evil as the good guys are as violent as the criminals, maybe even more.Benicio del Toro is really amazing starring as Alejandro. He truly deserved an award for his performance. He is very chilling but we understand why he is so driven by revenge. The ending scenes where he kills everyone in his way to finally murder the entire cartel family including children is frightening. This is hard to witness and I felt for those children as well as the corrupted police officer's son after his father was murdered by Alejandro.I'm giving a high note because it's nonetheless intense and to reward the performance of the casting which is over the top as the directing. But god this is frightening.",8,0,0,26 May 2016
Titanic," It should be called 'Iconic'
","When this picture came out in 1998, I was only a toddler but this movie will always be among my favorites. Each time I'm watching it, I'm always taken by the same array of emotions and it never changed. I'm still as impressed by the CGIs and the impressive work the staff accomplished to make this movie possible.Thanks to them, The Titanic, this gigantic British ship supposed to be unsinkable but did anyway during her ill-fated maiden voyage, came back to life and we can see how beautiful she was. Being able to recreate her to the smallest detail is certainly a great achievement and the result is as amazing as they could have imagined. It must have taken an incredible amount of research hours to reach this level of realism. The success of the picture is also the ones of all the people involved in this project. The sinking scenes are masterfully done but don't fell in the 'too much' view we always see in nowadays Hollywood movies. It's spectacular without being exaggerated and more interesting, James Cameron didn't take freedom with history.But the focus is not on the Titanic which is just the setting for a wonderful romance between Jake (Leo Di Caprio who is just so cute) and Rose (Kate Winslet who was the incarnated grace), two young people who weren't supposed to be together but fall in love and fought for survival together when the ship sinks in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. This romance looked like a fairy tale, It has everything to be a wonderful one: two young lovely people, who met on the ship unexpectedly, fall in love despite their rank differences (Jake is from common people, he is poor and succeeded to get on board thanks to a poker game. Rose is from the high bourgeoisie, a wife to be promised to a rich but jealous industrialist but is boiling inside by all the rules and etiquette). But when the ship collided with the iceberg and start sinking everything change and both Jake and Rose will try to survive together in a freezing Atlantic Ocean waters. What a powerful story.Today, 17 years after its release, Titanic is still a movie we are talking about. Some love and others hate but this movie is still in memories and I'm sure it's not willing to fade away. Leo and Kate are renowned actors and shoots with the greatest. And me, I'm still overwhelmed by the huge emotions this movie brings me. It's one of the kind and will have always a special place in my heart.",10,1,3,24 February 2015
Zero Dark Thirty," Maya/Jessica Chastain vs Osama Bin Laden
","After the horrible attacks which happened on September 11, 2001, one man became the most wanted man on the Planet by every law enforcement authorities in the world: Osama Bin Laden.Zero Dark Thirty recalls the decade long search for OBL by the CIA and in particularly by one woman, Maya, who dedicated his life and friends to bring him to justice.Maya is very obsessed with OBL. She doesn't focus on any other objective than the capture or kill of the most wanted man on the planet, the brain behind 9/11 and the murderer of thousands of people. She is a very dark character who doesn't show much her emotion and who doesn't flinch. Most of all she is resilient and while everyone around him lost hope to find Bin Laden she was the only one to carry on and finally successfully tracking him down leading to the Seal Team Six operation which ultimately ended his life.Jessica Chastain is very convincing in her interpretation of Maya as a cold CIA analyst. Such an intense character requires a certain resilience especially while shooting the torture scenes which are quite hard to see.I can't talk about this movie without evoking the torture scenes. They are certainly crude and really hard to witness but you can't deny that those enhanced interrogation techniques were widely used by the interrogators to get information from their prisoners. On that movie we are directly introduced to them at the very first scene, a sign that everything will be disclosed even the harshest truth about how intelligence was obtained. So yes those scenes are terrible but necessary. Ignoring them would be ignoring the true reality.Now lets finally talk about the assault of the Abbottabad Compound which sheltered Osama Bin Laden. I have to say that I was amazed by the high attention of details brought to the construction of the set. It is looking so real I had the impression it was shot on site while the real one was demolished soon after the raid. This is really an amazing job from the construction crew. The attack is also very well shot and intense without any exaggeration from the scriptwriters and actors.So here it is I give it a 8 out of ten. The story is captivating and well shot. The performance of the casting is convincing especially Jessica Chastain's. But this movie is not for everyone. It is a violent movie at the image of what the reality looks like. The torture scenes requires to have a solid stomach. But it's a great movie which is probably not to the taste of everyone but it deserves its Oscar.",8,1,3,12 September 2015
12 Years a Slave," The Evil of Slavery
","12 years a slave is a movie which should be seen by everyone not for the amazing performance of its cast nor for the heartbreaking story of Solomon Northup. No it should be seen to remember how we, the human kind can be so monstrous and evil towards each other.Unfortunately still today, slavery is still present and this is a shame in this world today that such evil practice is still going on.It is also making you feel ashamed of being American, a citizen of a country which ways of life and thinking is based on freedom and equality. Knowing that we needed a bloody war which tore us apart for 4 years to end Slavery is really giving you chills.Through Solomon Northup, Steve McQueen is telling us the story of hundred of thousands men, women and children who saw their freedom and dignity brutally taken away by evil men who considered them as property and never as human beings. There are scenes who will literally break your hearts and hurt your feelings like the one where Solomon and other black people were sold to their future masters. When you see this woman getting separated of her children then checked and treated like a beast is sickening but it was the truth and it needed to be shown. Or this poor young woman who is whipped and tortured by the jealous wife of her owner.Slavery is evil and it is hard to understand how we could be such despicable monsters.So yes this movie is necessary for memory and to make sure that such evil will never be practiced again. That is why I gave it a 9 for the lesson which should never be forgotten.",9,0,1,18 October 2015
Joker," How Joker becomes Joker
","Joker. We all know who that character is even for the one who is a complete stranger to the Batman Universe. A psychopathic clown who takes everything as a comedy spreading evil and death as a wave of joke.This movie tells us the story of how a man who thought he was made to make people around him happy becomes the mean, evil murderer we all know. The story of a man whose life has been nothing but pain, loneliness and bullying. A man who got so sickened by what's going on around him, the evilness and cruelty of this world who takes him as a fool, he snaps and decides to take his revenge on it. This is the story of how Joker becomes Joker.Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in this role of a broken man who was already dead inside and chose to not care anymore. He is often very touching in his performance when he takes care of his sick mom or when he tries to figure out what makes him so different from the people around him. He made me feel a lot of sympathy for the character who I always considered as a heartless psychopath. I wept for him each time he was beaten up by cruel people and for the first time, he made me despise Thomas Wayne who until this movie has been pictured as a man caring for the people of Gotham.In this movie, he is the evil man, the selfish bully who considers the people on the fringe of society as a bunch of peasants and losers who are a burden to the city. That can be shocking but it's also refreshing.In fact this story shines a different light on why Joker becomes such an evil and merciless murderer. For him, he's not the one who is evil, it's the world around him and to take down that monster, he has to become a monster himself. He has to be that ruthless mean murderer to survive. Only for this, this movie should be praised and watched.I didn't realize this when I first reviewed this movie but a week after watching it and think it through with a cool head, I understand now. There are some scenes I don't understand yet especially the very last scene which still makes me feel like all of this was just a script running in his head. Maybe one day I will understand what it really means.Anyway that's a great movie and it deserves its high rating. I wouldn't be surprised if it reaps a lot of awards at the end of the year especially Joaquin Phoenix who is mesmerizing in this movie.",10,4,8,17 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Saga is now complete
","With the release of Revenge of the Sith, the Saga is finally complete. And it ended in an amazing way. This third and last movie of the prequel trilogy is by far the best one of it.While the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones suffered from several flaws, Revenge of the Sith has made me proud of being a Star Wars fan again.Maybe its not as good as the movies of the original trilogy but it is efficient and very well played. The tension goes crescendo until it culminates during the epic dual battle between Obi-Wan vs Anakin on the one side and Yoda vs Palpatine on the others.The fight between Anakin and Obi-Wan is epic and so captivating. I have chills when I watch it. It is perfectly executed and the awesome musical background by John Williams is achieving to get me completely mesmerized. It's powerful and tragic in the same time because of the brother relationship between Ani and Ben. It is two brothers fighting against each other, their friendship being torn off by Palpatine who corrupted Anakin. But the end of the fight is even more tragic when Obi-Wan has to see Anakin being burned alive after being fended off by his ex master. I cried at the end. What a powerful scene.The combat between Yoda and Palpatine is also very epic and powerful especially the senate fight scene when both are sending pods to each other. The fact that they fight inside the Senate is also a symbol for the story. Which would run the galaxy? The Good represented by Yoda or Evil represented by the wicked Emperor? The battle in the beginning of the movie over Coruscant is also incredible with all those battleships, fighters and bombers destroying each other in an interminable pace. The CGIs are really well done throughout the movie. The guys at Industrial lights and Magic did an awesome job knowing that most of the scenes were computerized. Those people are geniuses and they deserved to be recognized for the awesome work they achieved.About the music, John Williams and his orchestra once again proved their huge talent. The music is an integral part of the movie. It plays its own role and it achieved it in brio. Especially during the last fight between Ani and Obi-Wan when it adds to the tension of the moment. Kudos to all the musicians for their awesome talent.There are still some cheesy lines that's why I give a 9 out of ten. But this movie is really awesome and I hope Episode VII will be as great.",9,1,3,13 September 2015
Bruce Almighty," Jim Almighty
","If God would confide you his Mighty Power, what would you do? Who never ask himself or herself that question at some part of our life? Jim Carrey is playing Bruce Nolan, a reporter working for Eyewitness News, a Buffalo TV station. He has everything to be happy: he has a nice job, is appreciated by the entire community and his girlfriend. But when the anchorman position becomes available, Bruce got frustrated because his main competition, Evan Baxter (Played by Steve Carell), arrogant as hell, is collecting the good stories and sweeps while he is doing the low grade ones and he's making a fool of himself at each of the stories he's going through. So when Evan is officially promoted to Anchorman while Bruce is doing a live feed, Bruce loses it completely and get fired. The same evening he crashes his car into a light pole and as angry as he can get, blames God for all his misadventures. God, exceeded by all the critic and blame he got from Bruce, decides to challenge Bruce to do a better job than he does. Discovering unwillingly his new powers, Bruce starts to use them to get his life better. But soon, he also have to deal with the other aspects of God life and understands progressively that Being God seems much harder than it looks.The main source of fun in this movie is not the plot himself but Jim Carrey himself. It's just a pleasure to see him using God's power against the people around him or in various aspects of his own life. This role was made for Jim Carrey and his craziness. We can see how much fun he took playing Bruce Nolan and he literally is carrying this movie on his shoulders. There are several memorable scenes which just make you laugh to tears. It's hard to not laugh watching this movie, really hard!",9,2,2,6 May 2015
Casino Royale," A refreshing reboot
","Sometimes, when you decide to start all over from a blank page, it can be risky. You can lose die hard fans, who were too much used to the same machinery again and again. But in the case of James Bond, this fresh start was more than welcomed. When each 007 movies were all about the gadgets, the nice car and girls, this new one is focusing on what should make the essence of the franchise: James Bond himself.This James Bond is more vulnerable, he doesn't collect the dates of one night like we were used to see in the previous movies. He actually has feelings for the people he met throughout his mission and he really fell in love. He is also more perfectible: he makes mistakes and he learns some valuable lessons from it. He is more like us which make him automatically much more identifiable and appreciated by the common people. I particularly appreciate that change and I've fallen in love with Daniel Craig, who is playing Bond to perfection.The other big change is the complete disappearance of the gadgets. No more invisible car, no more coat which deploys and surrounds its wearer when he's caught in an avalanche or x-ray lenses. It could shock some of the die hard fans but to me it's a blessing because we can see how powerful James Bond is and again it's allowing us to see his real personality because he's not hiding anymore behind the gadgets. This time when he's in trouble, he only relies on his instinct and his allies.I give it a 10 because that's all it deserves and I seriously wish the screenwriters will keep with that direction because this is clearly a gold mine they are fallen upon.",10,1,6,3 June 2015
Midway," A very good surprise
","I have to be honest: I started with the very wrong assumption that this movie would be another Pearl Harbor disaster, full of historical inaccuracies and made up stories just to keep us entertained. For months I was stuck with that opinion until I made the jump yesterday night and decided to buy and watch this movie on YouTube where it was on sale.And I have to admit I was wrong all along. This movie is a gem. Roland Emerich didn't take any liberties with what actually happened that day and the months between the attack on Pearl Harbor and the decisive blow out over Midway. I just wished some other big moments of the Pacific War like the Dolittle Raid on Tokyo and the Coral Sea battle would have been more developed.The cast general performance is also on point. It's still entertaining without being overplayed unlike Pearl Harbor when everything was made to keep the melodrama going over the need of remaining accurate about the historical facts.So I definitely recommend to watch this movie. If you're making the same mistake of considering it as another Pearl Harbor, you are really missing up something. 9/10",9,0,2,24 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars without a story
","Before I start writing this review, I want to say I'm a huge fan of George Lucas' Universe. I have the 6 previous movies on Blu-Ray, which I love very much. I also played the games, watched Star Wars the Clone Wars film and TV show as well as reading the books.So I was eager to see this brand new episode of the main saga. The first without George Lucas in command. I heard good things about JJ Abrams and how he turned all he touched in gold so I was expecting a lot. At the end I am quite disappointed.It would be wrong to say everything is bad in this movie. It's still entertaining and enjoyable to watch. But I expected so much more of it. It's not any kind of saga we are talking here. It's a classic one which enchanted so many fans throughout the world for several decades. This is Star Wars and it should be something which will stay in memories whatever happens. And about that, it fails big times as it levels down with the average blockbusters of the genre. It has lost its magic. It's so saddening really and truly something I would have never foreseen. Even the Emperor wouldn't have.The only appealing side of 'The Force Awakens' and the only thing that seems to work almost correctly was the come back of the original cast. I wont lie, it's great to see Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher back. When Han Solo and Chewbacca appear for the first time and listening Ford saying 'Chewie we're home', I had a shiver. It was maybe the only time it did or was it another one when we see Leia and Han seeing each other for the first time.The rest of the cast is not bad but because of the lack of vision haunting this movie until the end, the characters are quite shallow. They have potential but you really need to dig much deeper to allow them expressing it completely. The only new face I really appreciated was BB8 the new droid. He is not as brave as R2D2 but his mimics melted me. He's really cute and sympathetic.Now lets talk about the mishaps. JJ Abrams missed his target. We never wished to see a copy & paste of the Original trilogy even if it's much bigger and stronger. What I was expecting was a movie which would be as visionary as the original story. So at the end I would have the feeling that despite all I've seen about Star Wars, it will still keep surprising me by bringing something new.Instead we have a fast-forwarded and very poorly written version of A New Hope and Return of The Jedi. The new characters are just the 2016 alter egos of the 1977 ones. There is absolutely not a single drop of originality throughout the movie. We have no difficulty to understand that Rey is related to Luke because like him she is stranded in a desert planet, trying to make a living by scavenging ships. Finn is just the black version of Han Solo. He wants to get out of the grip of the First Order aka The Galactic Empire or what's left of it, just like Han Solo wanted to escape from Jabba the Hutt. BB8 is R2D2, the only hope for the Resistance aka the Rebel Alliance, to save themselves from the Order. Kylo Ren is Anakin/Darth Vader who betrayed Luke as his grand father betrayed Obi Wan in a very identical way. And Han Solo is taking the role of Obi Wan as the iconic member getting killed by the bad guy. Like I said a copy & paste!So yes JJ Abrams definitely missed what makes the Star Wars Saga essence: the story. The Force Awakens hasn't any story. It has no vision. It may work for a movie like Transformers but you do that with Star Wars and you're digging your grave. As JJ Abrams used most of the material provided by the first trilogy, should I expect that he will pillage the Prequel trilogy for Episode 8? I would suggest JJ to use George Lucas for the next episode scriptwriting but as they are already producing Episode 8 while the Force Awakens is still available on theaters, I think we will enjoy another epic failure.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Legend begins
","I wasn't born when this movie was released for the first time in theaters. I heard many things about it especially how this movie was so badly received by the most acclaimed critics of that time and predicted very wrongly that this movie will be a bust.Well nearly 4 decades later, yes already, force is to admit that it was a true misjudgment from them. It is a classic and it will remain a model for the genre, the movie which revolutionized everything from A to Z. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I watched it time and time again with the same delight and it never fades away.There are so many to tell about that absolute masterpiece starting with the story. It has anything to please everyone. It's epic, chivalrous, has some dose of humor and first of all a story about friendship and how it pushes to make the most impossible tasks accomplished. There is also that epic aspect of the struggle between good and evil so beautifully depicted.Many of its scenes are also classics like the space battle against the Death Star, the light saber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader or even the final scene of the movie when Luke, Chewbacca and Han are awarded for their heroic moves which saved countless lives.I can talk also about the characters who are as famous as the movie itself. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia Organa, Darth Vader, CP-3O and R2D2 are part of the legend of the 7th art. It has become part of our culture, anywhere in the world.Then you have the music by John Williams which matches perfectly the mood of the movie. It's epic a lot of time, very sad when Obi Wan dies and the rest of the team is mourning his loss. The music is a big part of the effect the movie procures to us, to keep us engaged until the very end.The cast is also superb and there is such a strong bond between the actors which reflects a lot on the movie. At the time they weren't known but I guess there is a before and after Star Wars for Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. Now they have become such recognizable figures and I was very pleased to see them back together in the last installment of the saga even if it wasn't as good as I expected. Their performance were still very accurate like they were owned by their respective characters. How I wish it would have been the same for the rest of the cast.So this movie is how the Legend begins. How a movie supposed to crash became the starting point of a love story of almost 4 decades with the public. Like what you don't need the critics to make a movie becoming a true icon.",10,1,1,22 May 2016
Deadpool," Such a silly movie but I love it
","How can I describe Deadpool? First of all, Deadpool is not the kind of guy you would want introduced to your respectable parents. He is rough, he is vulgar, he has no ethic whatsoever and he's superficial. At the end of the date, you would all end in jail alongside him while he's eating a pizza.But this anti-hero side makes him so attaching and so charming in the same time. He's so refreshing compared to his X-Men buddies driven by justice and compassion while he clearly doesn't give a damn at all. This clash between two philosophies is a great source for hilarious scenes.The huge dose of humor is by the way welcomed because Deadpool is really violent as well. Some scenes despite being funny are also quite gory. A lot of people die in the movie most of them in a very violent way. But the lightness which comes from Deadpool makes them more enjoyable to watch.But most of all, the movie is allowing us to see the huge comical talent of Ryan Reynolds. He bears the movie on his shoulders. I can feel he has so much fun impersonating Deadpool and he shared his fun with his partners. This is making Deadpool a feel-good movie despite the huge darkness of the scenario. Even the big villain is funny in his way.9/10",9,3,10,6 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The best episode of the saga
","I remember watching a Star Wars documentary called Empire of Dreams which is about how the first trilogy came to life and his tremendous success which is still going on today. During one of the many interviews George Lucas gave for this doc, he remembered the huge deal of pressure he had to bear on his shoulders while filming Empire Strikes back.He produced it with his own money he earned thanks to the huge success of the first movie as he wanted to keep his independence from the big studios. The fans had also a lot of expectations about the upcoming movie so George Lucas wanted it the same level if not better than A new hope. And it is.While a new hope was focused on this small band of young people and their struggle to destroy a devastating weapon of mass destruction, Lucas has dedicated this movie into developing each one of the characters as well as the relationship between them with its lot of surprises. That famous scene when Luke learns the terrible truth about his father's fate is one of them and to me this is the knockout moment of Empire.The other big novelty is this romance between Han and Leia. It's a great addition to the story line which allows us to discover another entirely hidden side of both of them. It's fun and sweet to see them teasing at each other. It adds some lightness too in a very dark plot.We are also introduced to three main new characters who are part of the Star Wars Legacy: Yoda, The Emperor and Lando Calrisian. There's no need to introduce Yoda, the cunning and wise Jedi master, who is maybe small by this height but awesomely powerful with the Force. In the first movie, Obi-Wan introduced us to this powerful invisible superpower but Yoda is the one who tells everything about it while we follow Luke in his Jedi Training. He shows us the true meaning of the Force. This was what made this character so important to the general story. About the Emperor, even if we don't see much of him in Empire, we understand that he's the main villain of the story and that in fact Darth Vader is one of his victims.Of course we still see a lot of epic combat scenes like the Battle of Hoth with those imperial walkers advancing towards the rebel base, the pursuit in the asteroid field or of course the duel on Bespin between Luke and Vader which climaxed with the surprising revelation of Darth Vader to his son.All of those made this movie incredibly awesome. To me Empire Strikes back is the best episode of the entire saga and it's not surprising that so many are seeing it as the movie to compare each time a new star wars movie is released.",10,0,0,8 January 2017
Spectre," James Bond Episode IV
","When I pushed the theater doors yesterday night, I was really anxious and impatient. 3 years after Skyfall, which still amazes me today, James Bond is back. And what a come back.Before going further, I would like to warn you. If you think that Spectre is only about the come-back of Blofeld and his confrontation with James Bond, you are missing the greatest part of the plot. Simply because Spectre is another part of the global story line inaugurated by Casino Royale. This new opus is strongly linked to its 3 predecessors. What James got through, the death of the people he cares the most (Vesper and M), the enemies he crossed and eliminated (Le Chiffre, Dominic Greene and Silva), all of this have a repercussion on this new movie and the source of it is Blofeld and Spectre. So if you haven't seen the first 3 movies you could feel lost.Now that said, I have to say I enjoyed this movie so much. Daniel Craig is still perfect as a James Bond still hunted by his demons from the past. He is still a hero but a human hero with his weaknesses. I like this side really much because it is making more like us and more attractive. I am falling in love with James Bond and I hope he will go for another round.Lea Seydoux, which I discovered in Mission Impossible 4, is so graceful in her role as Madeleine. Again she is stronger than she looked. She is not a professional assassin like in MI4 but she has still her angelic aura. She also can take care of herself as we see her fighting on that train against a huge enemy. She will go far if she continues in this path.Christopher Waltz is just frightening as Oberhauser better known as Blofeld. As you probably know, Blofeld is to James Bond what Joker is to Batman. His favorite archenemy, the one responsible for all Bond torments. To incarnate such an evil character, you need to have a certain charisma and talent. Which Waltz proved throughout the movie. He is remembering me John Malkovich who has played a lot of psychopaths in his long career. Anyway I had chills throughout the scenes he appears especially the torture scenes. I remember my hand grasping tight my companion's one during it. So sorry for hurting you that way my love <3I would have wished to see more of Monica Bellucci who is also touched by her grace in the few scenes she is appearing. I would say it is a shame she has not a bigger part of this plot.Now I hope you will enjoy the movie as I did and I sincerely wish the Bond team will keep in that path because it is so much more interesting to see.",8,15,31,11 November 2015
The Bourne Supremacy," As good as the first movie
","After Bourne Identity, I was expecting that sequel to be as good and I'm not deceived. It has achieved to make me definitely love the saga.Jason Bourne is back but against his wishes. When the woman he loves got killed by a CIA assassin, he decides to go after them just like he promised at the end of the first movie.As expected, Bourne Supremacy is a bit darker than the first opus. We are introduced to new characters like Pamela Landy, a CIA station chief who is in charge of an operation related to the first mission accomplished by Bourne. When this op fails with the death of two men and Jason's fingerprints are found on the scene, she is tasked with taking him down. That's the beginning of a long series of twists which uncovers a much larger conspiracy within the CIA.Thankfully what makes the first movie so great, the thrilling action, is still there and so masterfully filmed once again. I'm truly amazed by its choreography which is perfectly timed and efficient. Knowing that Matt Damon was making his own stunts, it's truly impressive. I can't even imagine how much time he trained to reach that level of perfection.Keep it comin'!",9,1,1,19 February 2017
Beetlejuice," If you loved The Mask, you gotta love Beetlejuice
","When I watched for the very first time Beetlejuice, I was still a young child whose only reference to the After Life World was the TV show cartoon Casper, that young ghost whose only wish is to become a little boy once again.So when my parents showed me that movie for the first time and tried to comfort me, assuring that it's not as scary as it looks, I was spooked anyway (the pun is intended).But I loved it even if I was scared a couple of times. I don't know maybe it's because that movie reminds me a lot of one of my favorite childhood picture ever: The Mask.Even if the two stories are way different from each other, The Mask and Beetlejuice share a lot of similarities. Their main characters share the same craziness, the same power to do what they want without any limit, the same way to modify their body shape as well. They are both carefree and seem to get out straight from a cartoon. Maybe Michael Keaton has been one of the model Jim Carrey took the inspiration from to play such an eccentric character as The Mask.The secondary roles are greatly played too starting with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. They have a great chemistry together and they are so sweet impersonating that young couple who suddenly dies in a tragic car crash and are forced to watch what was their home being taken over by a very obnoxious family they want out. They are not particularly being gifted into scaring this family away but that what's making them so attaching.Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones and Glenn Shadix are also so good playing the new owners. My favorite is Winona by far. She's such a treat playing this young lonely goth girl who befriends Baldwin and Davis as they are the only ones who seems to care about her.Even Juno and her footballers alongside the dead staff are so hilarious to watch. The only two scenes in which they appears are so fun to watch. There's absolutely nothing to throw away about the cast performance, it's perfect.Just as this movie!",8,1,1,1 January 2017
Furious 7," For Paul and the family
","Perhaps Furious 7 wouldn't have that Box Office success and Popularity if the sudden death of one the main protagonists, Paul Walker AKA Brian O'Conner wouldn't have gotten in the way.But this is how it is. The heartbreaking death of Paul in that terrible car crash has made this movie so special to the heart of the long standing fans. The script can be so cliché and full of inconsistencies, this movie is the last film of Paul Walker and will always be.But what makes me to give that high note is the ending scene and the awesome tribute the rest of the fast and furious 'familia' made to Paul. They could have gotten his character to die like we have seen so many times in the past. Instead the scriptwriters rewrote the script to make a celebration of life and family.In fact, This entire saga is more about family than cars. Cars and race are just the theme and the objects attracting our attention. But the most important part of that story is the strong relationship between the characters and their interprets who are as linked in real life as they are in the movie. Each time one of their own dies they face it together as the actors are actually doing it with the loss of Paul the only REAL loss of this community. And this is what is making this beautiful.",9,79,92,17 October 2015
