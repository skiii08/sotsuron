50 First Dates," High Concept, but too late
","Okay -great concept - and some pretty good scenes. Okay - more than pretty good at times. It has a certain charm and lightness on it's feet. And I guess that's fine. But part of my wishes that the writing and acting talent could be put into something more original. It's been like a decade since Groundhog Day and though the plot is not the same - it somehow feel too unoriginal for my taste. I see why the film got made - it's trailer alone is a great example of the power of high concept. But I also wish that something more original could have been done here. I'm not knocking the film so much as saying - you managed to make a relatively good movie with this script - what if you'd really pushed for something as surprising as Groundhog Day was when it came out (not that it invented the genre, but it nailed it).",5,0,0,23 February 2006
