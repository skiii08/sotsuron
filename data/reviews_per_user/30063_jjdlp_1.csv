Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Where was the main course?
","My expectations were definitely too high, based on the original three films. Yet, the film really wasn't that bad, the acting was decent, Jar Jar Binks wasn't as annoying as I thought he'd be.  But due to the fact that two more films are on the way, Lucas could only show us so much.  The pod race scene, and the duel with Darth Maul, a scary bozo like entity, were wonderful; but Ewan McGregor, a great actor, could have been used better.  Natalie Portman, only 17, was great as Padme, but trite as Queen Amidala, while Samuel Jackson seemed only to be thrown in to put a minority, aka black person, in the film, there were only two that I noticed.  I couldn't stop thinking of Pulp Fiction, Ezekiel 25:17 during his brief on screen presence.  This first episode, spoon fed us and yet I want the entree now.  Patience will have to be my right hand man as Episode II and III are several years away.",6,0,1,24 May 1999
