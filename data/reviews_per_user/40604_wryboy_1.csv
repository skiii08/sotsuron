Deepwater Horizon," A thoroughly nauseating experience
","If I could give this a negative star review, I would. I don't know what happened to film making, but it seems to be just dead and buried. Imagine a film where the camera is close up onto the pores of an actors skin and then shake the camera back and forth for and hour and a half. Quick cuts, close shots, shaky cam. Just terrible and I mean terrible direction. Shame. Shame. Shame.",1,2,5,2 March 2018
