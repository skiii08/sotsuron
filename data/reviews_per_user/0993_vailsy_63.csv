The Avengers," Like watching 50 video game cinematics back to back
","I found after each scene there needed to be something interactive to do and if you were to glue lots of video game cinematics together you would get something quite similar to this movie, i.e you would have no flowI found the storyline quite shallow, the character introductions unnecessary, and the whole experience was rather disjointed to me I also hate movies where I need to adjust the volume throughout the movie, unlike the Dark Knight for example which probably has one of the tightest mixes for an action movie, this one was all over the place.. quiet dialogue and extremely loud action sequences The music was suitably dramatic but not especially memorable Comparing it to similar movies I would rate The Avengers a little better than the Fantastic Four but nowhere near as good as the X-Men movies",5,2,8,16 December 2012
Black Swan," Destined to age badly - over-hyped and ludicrous
","I went to see an afternoon showing of this movie, which included a broad section of society from seniors through to slightly underage attendees, perhaps 14 or 13 I'm sure I heard a pace maker malfunctioning on more than one occasion during what I can only consider to be, soft porn! We're treated to 2 masturbation scenes, long drawn out scenes of very visually and audibly precise cunnilingus and all sorts of other ott debauchery here Portman is in no way convincing as a competitive dancer. There is no way that a fragile person like the one she portrays here would make it in the competitive world of dancing. Also Portman's attempts at acting drugged up were a joke Portman does her usual anguished face, which she has been doing since Leon. Literally she used the same expression as she did at the door in Leon several times here. She was not convincing in this part for me at all. I also found Winona Ryder to be quite ridiculous and a little like the Wicked Midget Witch of the West Artistically this movie is barren and does not come close to Requiem for a Dream for example, it is commercial trash actually. The soundtrack in particular is dull and lifelessSorry but this film will win awards and then will be looked back on as being actually quite ridiculous and a terrible mistake Please don't expect this to be Swan Lake the ballet, like many senior people did yesterday at theatre I was at. It was an embarrassment",3,17,53,29 December 2010
Mission: Impossible III," if Tom Cruise could drop his Ego he might just make a great movie..
","for the first 3/4's this movie hardly takes its foot of the pedal, and its a real thrill ride. highly watchable as well mostly because cruise is working within a unit with other good quality actors contributingsuch a pity then that the movies latter quarter is your standard cruise ego ride... this is how fast i can run, this is how far i can jump, watch how many of my own stunts i do, look how fabulous i look for my age, look how loving i am, look how nice my teeth are, bring me back to life because i'm just so so *fabulous*!if tom cruise could have the ability to drop his ego, fund a movie stand back and allow other actors to take the limelight then maybe he could be part of a really great filmhe almost does it here, but does not succeedwhat tom cruise needs to understand is that he is not liked among certain quarters. thus an overly long and quiet scene with him being brought back to life, and an extremely cheesy love line just prior to that, are just not going to hit the spot. i could feel the irritation in the audience i was innevertheless he throws in a good performance, and overall i do like the guy. top marks to Philip Seymour Hoffman, he is extremely menacing and intimidating in this movie. also Jonathan Rhys Meyers is brilliant and confidently understated, as usualif both of these characters had been given a little more airplay this movie could have been fantastic rather than just good",6,1,3,5 May 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," All talk.. no substance
","with a great looking cast (ben kingsley, bruce willis, lucy liu) i was expecting a lot from this film. unfortunately the movie tries far too hard, and winds up falling flat on its posterioreverything is hyper stylised, from the home furnishings and decors to the outfits and script the movie is also badly let down by a static and wooden central performance (a young nicolas cage for example might have turned this into a great movie), and a very poor if non existent scoreother performances are also weak... lucy liu for example is wet and girly. everything you don't want from a liu performance is hereto top it the director was clearly so happy with the films story telling ability that he feels the need to explain everything at the end of the movie, in the style of a scooby doo mysterythis film is exhausting, boring, predictable and very disappointing",3,7,22,24 February 2006
3:10 to Yuma," does a realistic western exist?
","i've read many complaints on IMDb about how this movie is not realistic, and how lots of silly things happen. so what is so peculiar about that? just about every western i have ever seen has been vastly unrealistic, but thats part of the genre isn't it? most of the direction of this movie has a deeper significance which goes beyond superficial notions of realism. and essentially centres around a quest for redemption. bale acting as crowes guiding light and to an extent vice versa. both performances are excellent, and actually there really isn't a bad performance in this film the deeper storyline is accompanied by some wonderful action sequences. although these get ear splittingly noisy toward the end the film has some lovely sound overall though. really good use of gunshot reverb in the surrounds. with only the odd distracting moment with the sound of coyotes(?). loved the sound of the horse/cart rattling along, the sound of the steam train pulling in etc. overall excellent layering of sounds. loved it.i also really liked the costumes, esp the wonderful coats/jackets i don't have a bad thing to say about this film. it was the most entertaining 'modern' western that i have seen to date",8,3,6,15 September 2007
Gravity," great visuals, otherwise lacking and quite cheesy
","you may have heard about the wonderful visuals on display in Gravity and yes these might be worth the price of admission, but considering the amount of hype surrounding this film I expected it to have more depth and was surprised to see a basic and shallow blockbuster action movie mainly Sandra Bullock's character came across to me as being very shallow going from extreme panic, to bark like a dog dejected woman, to ms motivated with no subtleties in between. It's as if she was abducted by aliens from a shopping mall and beamed into a space suit in orbit. i found her performance perfectly unbelievable Clooney is... Clooney in a space suit and he reminded me of buzz lightyear There were also some extremely cheesy moments, like the 3d tears, the bit where Bullock howls like a pooch, Clooney angel, and the very end of the film where we pan up Bullocks ms. universe body is quite cringe-worthy tooOn a technical level I disliked the sound design in the movie. I'd heard from many audio people that the soundtrack was amazing, but it is very see it hear it throughout and the focus on hearing every breath Bullock takes becomes very grating after awhile. They could've established the claustrophobia and still taken some chances with the sound, instead it's turn this screw and hear a muted screw turn, and of course the customary post explosion tinnitus sound. All very predictable (I'm no astrophysicist but I also found some of the science in the movie to be a little sketchy.. eg. the effects on the human body when exposed to a vacuum. I think Arnie was closer in Total Recall!)All of the above obviously suited the film makers since they were clearly batting for a basic commercial blockbuster action movie with great 3d visuals to earn lots of dollars, which is what Gravity is",6,4,9,12 October 2013
Lone Survivor," good.. right up until the lone survivor part
","I went into this movie with low expectations mostly because of the bad Chuck Norris style title and the fact that Mark Wahlberg was in it, but right until the final 45 minutes I was quite surprised with the quality.. it's a very good action movie up until that point Unfortunately not enough time is spent on the final leg of the movie after he is helped by the Afghan villagers. So instead of doing that part an injustice, either they should've missed it out entirely and ended when he makes contact, focusing on his actual lone survival and traversal through the hostile environment (in keeping with the movie title) for the day or so before he was saved. Or made the movie longer and given the village section the movie time that it deserves.. i.e at least the same amount of movie time as the action sequences Instead time is spent overdramatizing when it really isn't needed, the action sequences are enough. We see Marky Mark in his under armour being brought back to life, he flat lines, there are slo-mo shots, and then we have a really o.t.t credits sequence where we see lots of photos of the real guys etc. notably the Asian soldier in the pictures is missing from the movie. Why? as I understand it he was on the chopper that was shot down trying to save them So a good movie but ultimately it focuses on action and sentimentality rather too much, I doubt those guys want that, and is disappointing for it",6,0,0,21 December 2014
Fight Club," rejection of consumerism hard to swallow...
","coming from cast members who've enjoyed multi-million dollar l.a weddings etc.if you're going to comment on issues as fundamental as this, then live the lifestyle. otherwise it just doesn't wash. you should leave it to someone else.pitt is also very unrealistic as a tough guy in this movie. his performance in snatch was much better and benefited from some humour. the chain smoking carter is also tedious and fakei found this movie both pretentious and irritating. i've met many people who found this film illuminating... it said absolutely nothing to me.",1,23,63,15 April 2004
Inglourious Basterds," Great movie, but why was Brad Pitt given top billing?
","I like Inglourious Basterds a lot, but not because Brad Pitt is in it, who as usual over acts and isn't very good. The reason I like it is because of Melanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz Since both people, Melanie Laurent for absolute definite, have more screen time and hand in superior performances why did Brad Pitt get his face plastered all over the movie and get top billing? This factor turned me off of the movie when it was marketed and stopped me from seeing it at the cinema, and even after watching the movie and enjoying it as I have done many times, this thing still bugs me. I am surprised that someone as head strong as Tarantino stood for it Great movie but the Brad Pitt factor prevents me from awarding Inglourious Basterds any more than a 8, 'out of general principle'",8,0,2,12 January 2013
World War Z," this movie proves conclusively that Brad Pitt really is a deity
","*contains lots of spoilers* 2 minutes into the movie and with no character development we are in the thick of the action and from this point onward in pretty much every location in the movie, everyone dies except for Brad Pitt and his family Indeed at one stage the entire nation of Israel goes down, except for Brad Pitt and some girl he saved by hacking off her hand regardless of this I was still kind of with the movie for it's entertainment value, until the scene on the aeroplane where, once again, everyone dies except for Brad Pitt and some girl he saved by hacking off her hand in this particular quite silly scene Brad, no doubt because of his enhanced field training, knows to throw a grenade inside the plane to make a hole in the fuselage which will suck out all the zombies. he also predicts accurately that if he straps himself into his seat in time he will survive once the plane crashes killing the pilot and co pilot. After a short blackout, behold.. Brad Pitt is alive in the wreckage strapped to said seat, and some girl he saved..injured Brad and the girl he saved now find themselves in Wales (yes.. Wales. it's the apocalypse and they have to go to bloody Wales) and are able to navigate from the plane crash site in the middle of the countryside to a medical research facility no problem without encountering any zombies. they just rock up at the gates to the facility then they find a solution, terminal disease, a camouflage allowing humans to burn and nuke zombies at will. and now we can wait for Brad Pitt's World War Z 2 ..",5,1,2,7 December 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," everyone progresses... except for knightley
","i enjoyed this movie more than the first, mostly because the best thing in the first movie (johnny depp) is given more screen time. he continues to play with his character here with some very funny scenes indeed. i really hope they manage to get keith richards involved in the third one, as the pair on screen at the same time would be a hootwill is also far better in this movie, mostly because his relationship with his father gives him some emotional depththe worst thing about the first movie (knightley), luckily is in this movie the least. she gives us precisely the same pouting facial expressions as normal, and offers nothing new here at all. she is certainly given the opportunity to act... she has to pretend to be a boy for a good portion of the movie. but other than being flat chested she is not convincingi'm a little worried about how the 3rd movie is set up, as it looks like depp won't appear in it for some considerable time. so i would have preferred a different ending to this movie.as usual these days the movie is slightly too long, with some scenes that should have ended up on the cutting room floor. but overall i liked it a lot. some brilliantly choreographed action scenes... and i also loved the gnarled looking sea dwelling band of pirates (especially the hammer head one, great). go see it",7,0,2,7 July 2006
Argo," highly over-dramatised
","I'm positive that if this story was told in a realistic fashion it would be a very good movie or documentary and I have no doubt that the original story is fascinating, unfortunately it is badly exaggerated here and basic missing details undermine the movies believability The story is that they are location scouting for a movie yet at no point do any of them get into character and discuss the movie and the merits of shooting it in Iran, surely that would be necessary in order to pull something like this off Instead they are all constantly beady eyeing the Iranian military and looking massively shifty at all times, including Affleck who is supposed to be a trained CIA operative but at no point acts like the brash producer that he is supposed to be imitating The movie climaxes with the Iranians chasing the plane down the runway as it takes off and nearly cutting in front of the aircraft.. they weren't able to just make a phone call. At this point since believability had gone out of the window I thought it was going to go Die Hard with Affleck fighting an Iranian military man on the wing of the plane To make up for it, at the end of the movie as a cherry on top Affleck gets back with his wife with American flag waving in the backgroundAll of these extra dramatisations were unnecessary and spoilt what would have otherwise been a very good movie",6,1,2,5 June 2014
Hot Fuzz," good, but i'll have to be a sad t*sser and take ear guards to the cinema in future
","i really did enjoy this movie a lot, right up until the part where the shoot out spills over into the bar. at which point the volume of this film just got totally ridiculous. why on earth do we need that kind of bass? in the small theatre i was in, it was like sitting in a bass bin. utterly ludicrous and really really distracting. how can you enjoy a film with one finger stuck in your ear hole? the earlier parts of the film are excellent. there are some brilliant lines here, especially when offcr angel is settling into his new station. people (/officers) in law enforcement with a sense of humour will really love this one as well, and would have to admit that it's a pretty accurate depiction in a lot of respects especially with some of the characters and terminologythere are some real laugh out loud moments and some great accents pronouncing 'Lond-en' etc. it just got a bit too ott and repetitive for me especially at the end. if it had about 20 minutes or so, timothy dalton and some noise lopped off i would rate it higher. but unfortunately the person who mixed this in particular was either negligent or gratuitous.protectors in future for me, because my ear holes are not taking a pounding like that again!",6,9,23,4 April 2007
Terminator Salvation," What happened to the Phased Plasma Rifle in 40 Watt range?
","!!*LOTS OF SPOILERS*!! Aside from the very cheap looking titles (absolutely terrible actually) the first third of this movie was really enjoyable but it then unfortunately flushes itself down the toilet It's great right until the moment Connor is on Kyle Reese's tail, ready to test the disabling device on the harvester. I thought at this point they would save Reese and spend a large portion of the movie protecting him. Unfortunately after flying all the way to LA to investigate suspicious Terminator activity Connor changes his mind for no apparent reason and the movie just nose dived from there - just about the time in the movie where we get an awkward, unnecessary and crap fade out to black and when some super model with shady acting skills gets tangled up in a tree. For me the movie dies about there The Terminators start off promising, with each type having a menacing sound associated with it but unfortunately the stickler is they seem completely unable to terminate anything (even with mini-guns) and seem to wander around in quite a disorganised fashion like Ronin, and resembling vagrants. A far cry from the shiny beasts we see in the flash backs, and with very low tech guns.. what ever happened to the 'Phased Plasma Rifle in 40 Watt Range'?? All those cool lasers they had in the flash backs?? No sign of them. Maybe because it's only 2018 and they haven't been invented yet..The movie is also at least 30 minutes too short given all of the characters that we need to learn about. Reese for example, er the mute telepathic baby that he hangs out with ? Bale performs a noble effort but maybe could lighten up a little. Leaders have to inspire people, keep morale high etc. I'd find Bale's Connor a tough person to follow personally. I like Bale but he should have seen the light, listened to his DP and broken out of character :). Couldn't resist it Anyway John Connor's pretty talented. He strolls straight into Terminator central to save Reese who the Terminators decided not to Terminate yet.. maybe thinking they'd do it James Bond style with a laser between the legs At one point Connor forages for jump leads to revive his mate. I had this image of Bale desperately trying to resuscitate the movie but alas unfortunately we already witnessed Bonham Carter doing her very best Max Headroom impression, and the Arnie/Hulk Did I really see the word Sony appear at some point on a piece of Connor's equipment, lit up momentarily by an electric spark? Maybe not. Anyway Terminator Salvation definitely didn't hold my attention past 40 minutes. I had very high expectations of this movie but unfortunately left the theatre disappointed. I hope you like it better",5,5,10,21 May 2009
The Day After Tomorrow," what a ridiculous film
","it's amazing how Hollywood can belittle even the most enormous problems facing mankind. in this case they make the effects of global warming into some kind of big joke the ice age takes place during the course of the film, and other than the occasional nod to the fact that this has effected other parts of the world including japan, the u.k, and europe. we mostly concentrate on the effects on los angeles and new york, and the forced evacuation of u.s citizens into south America (canadians btw are totally written off as dead meat) if this whole thing wasn't stupid enough the film concentrates on the perilous trek made my dennis quaid and a couple of his buddies from Philadelphia to his son, who is in a library in new york.the movies low point comes when one of our leading men is being chased around a freight ship by a pack of wolves. in my dreams this would happen to the producer of this movie",1,5,11,20 January 2008
Cloverfield," highly enjoyable, but could have been even better
","the whole first person effect for this film really makes it a lot more adrenalin thumping. i also really liked how the monster is out of view most of the time as it really added to the suspense feel and gave me a better feel about how immense the monster was just a pity about the actual storyline parts. while it was believable that a single person would return for a loved one even under the most perilous of circumstances, the chances that a whole bunch of other people would overcome the instinct to preserve their own lives and tag along, for me stretched the believability somewhat. even a monster movie needs to be structured in a believable wayi also felt the edit at the end was not so good. a film like this needs to go out on a big bang rather than a soppy whimper. BIG SPOILER *and after our cameraman gets chomped* we have to then wonder if extra movie time is going to enhance the film or not. for me the end came at the wrong moment overall though, the monster was great (not sure about the mini ones though) and i enjoyed the film a lot. it was far better than 'the host' for example, a very similar Korean movie which surely must have influenced Cloverfieldthe sound and effects in the film are absolutely first rate. and somehow the space that the monster occupies/destroys seems very real. the sound system at the theatre where i watched it was poor but when the monster smashed things it still sounded very cool, and as well as the heavy thumps you could almost hear the dust grains settling afterwardsi wasn't aware of the various websites and blogs that support the movie until after, so i've been enjoying those. i recommend everyone takes a look as it really gives the movie a heightened level of believability and depth when you read about the Japanese corporation behind it all, Tagruato, Slusho and the hints that the monster was awoken and seemingly chased by the military before it made it to Manhattanoverall a really brilliant film that has stayed with me for some time after viewing it, but it could have been even better imo had the actions of some of the central characters been a little more believable, and if they'd left the smaller critters out of the picture!",8,1,5,18 January 2008
Silent Hill," kinky boots
","firstly lets establish that this is one hell of a chick flick, with a huge majority of the movie being played by femalesin all seriousness, at times there is some incredible sexual tension going on between the two female leads: Radha Mitchell and Laurie Holden. you'd have to feel this movie will be popular within the lesbian communityand for us fellas? what a treat... one blond in knee high leather boots with a knife tucked inside, and another dressed in a skin tight police woman's uniform and a shiny gun and utility belt!!! just who would come out on top in a mud wrestle between these two lovely ladies?? (slobber)back to the film(!).. far better than any other game to movie translation that i've seen yet. it took me awhile to actually realise it was based on the game (duh) since the movie had serious actors in it, and was creatively presented both visually and aurallylots of similarities in feel (look and sound) between this and the recent remake of 'the hills have eyes'. in the latter half of the movie some unnecessary 'gamey-fied' scenes including levels, maps and platform style jumps and swingsoverall though very eerie with some imaginative and wild explosions of gore. my wife hated it (especially as a extra 1st anniversary treat), i was pleasantly entertained though (especially by the aforementioned blondes!!...)",7,2,4,25 April 2006
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Boy
","Pretty much this movie should be called spider-boy because the guy playing him looks and acts way too young and most things about spider-man have been reimagined here. This is ok and I have no problem with it, I left my perceptions of spider-man at the door when I watched this at the cinema and accepted that some things about the character might need to be reinterpreted for a new younger audience, but really calling it spider-boy may actually have been a better ideaThe effects for me are not as good in homecoming as they were in the amazing spider-man which as a past collector of the comic books is the closest movie I have seen to the spider-man I know, and that movie had great actors nearly across the board. Really Emma Watson and Andrew Garfield were in a different class. I found Tobey Maguire incredibly slow as spider-man and nowhere near sharp enough (although because doc ock was so perfect, spider-man 2 is still the best overall movie). In homecoming we get the other extreme which is a spider-boy that won't shut upOn second viewing I don't like this movie and find it irritating. The spider-man moving eyes are stupid, most of the acting in it is hammy and bad with the exception of Michael Keaton.. the vulture is really good and it is a pity that he wasn't in one of the previous moviesOverall not a good spider-man movie and hopefully another reboot will get things back on track in the future",5,3,6,13 January 2019
Shutter Island," Very weird but ultimately fantastic
","While I haven't been so impressed with some of Scorsese's other recent works, this one is a real creative triumph I won't mention much about the story as it would be easy to spoil it. I also urge you to refrain from reading about it, but they capture the time period incredibly well and the genre is detective/horror/psycho-thriller Lots of very artistic camera work and scenes here to enjoy - really liked the quick pan outs when they are getting oriented with the prison layout A/B/C sections. Also the dream sequences are brilliant, each one like a separate piece of artInitially I was quite confused about where they were going with it, but then I was completely reeled in by the story. The film works like that, gradually pulling you further in The score for the movie is amazing and I doubt the film would be nearly as good without it. Quiet percussive, almost ambient based and subtle at times, while at others very loud and dramatic like an old b/w movie. Loved it. For those interested - the sound in the movie was also very cool. Weather is a really important feature in the movie, and I loved the rain especially the indoor sound that they achieved for some of the scenes - a really minimal but very effective tapping sound. Not many people will notice it but it's hard to do, and very nice To top it off a highly emotionally charged performance from Dicaprio, which is definitely where his strength lies - reminded me of his early work on Gilbert Grape for intensity. Ben Kingsley is amazing as usual, he achieves a character somewhat like a posh Don Logan! Sometimes darkly humorous, which is a nice break from the movies otherwise dark tones. All other major performances in the movie are top class. I myself didn't realise going in but Michelle Williams (Heath Ledgers former partner) is in the movie and delivers an amazing performance I found the whole movie Lovecraft-like, and would love to see Scorsese try his hand at something along those lines Highly enjoyable",9,1,4,14 March 2010
Full Metal Jacket," second half rarely gets enough praise..
","while the first half of this movie is absolutely first rate, and has actually led to a lot of well known and used popular one liners, my most recent viewing of this film made me appreciate the second part a lot more than previouslythis section was actually shot in an old disused gas works just a few miles from my home town, and people from school used to go there to collect shells etc..the reason i like this section is that it focuses on urban warfare, whereas just about every other Vietnam movie ever deals exclusively with countryside/rural settings. actually control of the main urban centres was vitally important and clearly a deciding factor for the eventual outcome of the war.anyone that has been lucky enough to visit Vietnam since can get an idea of what it might have been like to fight in areas such as this, and while Kubricks vision doesn't try to provide realism it gives a hyper-real flavour for this setting. using the old beckton gas works was a master stroke in my view. the stark imagery is fantastic. and luring troops into 'deserted' urban areas, to be held off by small numbers of troops and snipers would seem like a realistic and effective tactical setting a lot of the dialogue is fake in this section, but you'd have to feel that it is intentionally so. it provides a TV/documentary style that captures the bizarre essence of the photographers and camera-men present during the conflict, and the unreal/odd footage that those people were likely to have obtainedoverall the latter half of the movie has a weird aura about it, emphasised further by a stark soundtrack. you can literally hear every move the soldiers make, every footstep, jangle of a water bottle or grenade. i also love the grating/thumping and sparing 'musical' accompaniment used here no one has made a perfect and unbiased movie about Vietnam at this point, but this film takes a unique and interesting slant on it, avoiding cliché",8,0,2,14 June 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," yawn
","We start off promisingly with lots of retro 1930's sights and sounds, wartime patriotism, Nazis, ancient artifacts and adventure. But once our hero becomes Captain America the movie quickly dissipates into a formulaic messThe weak plot is the biggest letdown. The Red Skull plans to wipe out various capital cities across the globe. We are given no explanation as to why, and are left to assume that his motive is simply 'world domination' in the style of Dr Evil. This leads to lots of chasing around ending with a climactic battle between Cpt America and the Red Skull in which his best known comic book adversary is wasted after just a couple of minutes of one on one fighting because.. he drops his magic cube. oops!Other dull aspects of the film include the score, which is one of the most unmemorable I've heard for awhile. I could not recall it even during the movie, and I challenge you to remember a single bar. The audio is repetitive and irritating.. massive overuse of the camera warm up sound ('weeee'), which has now been used everywhere, for every weapon owned by the Red Skull. Customary use of Wilhelm scream, used in spectacularly unimaginative and overt fashion. Very uninspired Red Skulls makeup/cgi looks atrocious by the way and the guy that plays Captain America is thoroughly uncharismatic. This whole film for me was paint by numbers and a money machine for a sequel, kids lunch boxes and the avengers, which I am also expecting to be crap. When other movies like Batman set the bar so high, movies like Captain America are becoming increasingly difficult to tolerate",5,1,5,25 August 2011
Oblivion," a poor dollars spent / movie quality ratio
","I actually quite like Tom Cruise and am not a Cruise-basher, I also like sci-fi, but this movie failed for me on a number of counts The pacing is bad and there is no build up or developed back story, instead the audience is thrown straight into the middle of it all. It's obvious very early on who the bad people are going to be and where things will end up, and because Oblivion is also quite long, things get boring The special effects are nice for the most part, but the drones get repetitive after a while. it has some nice sound, but really nothing exceptional. It reminded me a little bit of Lost in Space from 1998, big budget bland sci-fi There are some badly wasted actors such as Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jamie Lanister from Game of Thrones) who is given about 2 lines to speak, the ultimate crime in my opinion because he would probably be a better lead than Cruise himself The female lead Olga Kurylenko is extremely limited and one dimensional, and spends most of her screen time glaring at Tom Cruise like he is some kind of god figure Oblivion tries to be everything at once.. complex sci-fi conspiracy movie, action, romance, but ends up lacking in all departments There are so many better things to watch in this genre both on the big screen and on TV, including the previous Cruise/Sci-fi outings Minority Report and War of the Worlds, both are better than Oblivion. Overall Oblivion was a wasted $130 million endeavour",5,0,2,6 April 2014
Man of Steel," first hour and a half outstanding, final hour poor = movie too long
","I'm not sure why Hollywood cannot do the math and realise that less is very often more. The visual effects in Man of Steel are about the best I have seen but they are best enjoyed during closer fight scenes, so for me the movie peaked when Superman did battle with Non and Faora. This scene is unbelievably good Obviously things needed to get bigger from there with a final confrontation but the plot for the final hour is way OTT. The gravity machines had great potential as a plot device but why not slow things down a bit.. eg. the devices are used as a threat to make Superman surrender, maybe they need more time to activate before they can be used, or make it so that Superman doesn't figure out what to do in one minute flat This all could've been achieved while still shaving a good 15 minutes from the run time, and there would've been less human casualties for people to complain aboutFor me even with it's vastly inferior effects, the final 45 minutes of Superman 2 were far better and more memorable, as was Lois Lane in the original trilogy, here she is completely featureless",7,0,1,10 May 2014
28 Weeks Later," some good visual effects but a threadbare storyline..
","the first job of a horror movie is to make you jump, and this film does have several good moments in that department. but the storyline really could have been a lot tighter...an ultra high security compound that allows 2 kids out to roam the streets. and then we are meant to believe these children would have the guts to go outside in the first place, then enter a creepy deserted pizza joint and take scooter keys from a bony corpse. sorry? then allow a janitor into a quarantine zone with the first armed troop being a mile away then a chopper that manages to decapitate dozens of rage victims (nice effect though) without crashing ..the list goes on and on. the film could have gone in exactly the same direction, but would have been more convincing if underpinned by a tighter storylineand the greatest crime of all? allowing Robert Carlyle, the best actor in the room by a long chalk, to spend 3/4's of the movie running around like a rabid dog! overall pretty entertaining, but with a quality story and better utilisation of a great actor, this movie could have been outstanding",6,1,3,16 May 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," great horror fun!
","some people here have said 'even better than the original' etc... from what i've heard, that isn't saying much!!however i still found this movie to be highly entertaining, and it satisfied what i was looking for... i.e a good gore fest to enjoy with the missusthe first half of the film is quite gripping because you don't actually see the horror, however after seeing two of the deformed villains in a fairly farcical caravan sequence the movie then develops on nicely to a good old fashioned tasteless horror rompAaron Stanford, who you'll recognise from the x-men, puts in a good show as a nerdy liberal telecommunications salesman. by the end of the movie he looks in very poor shape indeed, but still manages to muster some good old fashioned American spunk to help him pulp the mutated flag waving red necks!some of the other characters are quite annoying though, and the movie tries hard (but fails) to be as disturbing as 'wolf creek' (some scenes are completely and shamelessly stolen from that movie)however on the whole this is great mindless fun. go in with low expectations as i did, and you might just be in for an unpleasant surprise..",7,2,4,21 March 2006

","Shockingly poor movie title aside, I'd heard this film was good so went in with reasonably high expectations. These were met, mostly down to the close focus on story and character development, and some fine actingI've followed UFC since the very early days, watching the dodgy VHS tapes of Royce Gracie in the 90's, and I also love quality film. Warrior finds a happy compromise. Yes the fighting is ott at times, a couple of highly suspect moves - guillotine escape to arm bar? some Hulk Hogan style body slams, bundles of ground and pound that would stop fights immediately miraculously saved by the bell, and also a silly Russian fighter complete with flag and Rocky IV type music Thankfully these moments are rare. The fighting feels authentic enough mostly helped by fast and slick editing, and TV segments and commentators that feel real - not an easy taskNotably strong performances are turned in by all three leads. The father, Nick Nolte, who really digs deep for this role (some personal experience?) and both sons; Joel Edgerton who I was really impressed with (he's in the upcoming Thing remake so I now hold out a candle of hope for that movie) and Tom Hardy from Inception etc who I barely recognized as he was so bulked up. The supporting cast are also solid including some familiar MMA faces and fighters The best part of the story for me was the brother who works as a teacher and needs to fight again or lose everything. I've taught, and I've sometimes imagined what the students would think if their teacher became an mma fighter!! Here we see it happen and it lends some nice humour to an otherwise mostly serious film Obviously don't go in expecting art-house or Raging Bull, but this is easily up there with The Wrestler for example. If you want a fun and very emotion driven movie then go see it",8,1,5,25 September 2011
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Preferred the 1st one then. Still prefer it now
","Don't get me wrong, this is a great film but it is much more child friendly compared to the first movie, and is more commercial The biggest problem I have with it is that the whole Mexico thing goes on for far too long and the movie loses a huge amount of it's pace. I have never been able to fully engage with this movies second half for that reason. Granted the first film also slows down mid way-ish but for nowhere near as long, and we always feel that Sarah and Kyle are being relentlessly hunted and in considerable danger. Indeed, they are attacked immediately after and so the pace continuesIn Judgement Day we know the characters are in a place of relative safety at this point in the movie and the feeling of pursuit is well and truly lost from thereon inI much preferred Arnie as the bad Terminator, and find a lot of the comedic aspects of this sequel goofy, taken to a further extreme in the third outing. They also date the film furtherI feel that the first movie has strangely aged better than this one. It is set firmly in the 80's but without all the stupid guns and roses and other obvious 'cultural' references. The liquid metal thing while amazing at the time would let's be honest, look a little crap to young eyes I'm sure. The opening sequence is still brilliant The sound in Judgement Day is unbelievably good. All the weapons sound fantastic and full of character, especially the grenade launcher, mini-gun and the T1000's Beretta. Although I did prefer the delayed style heart beat effect in the first one which intensified the tension and was a very clever audio cue. They use a similar device in Judgement Day but it's not nearly as goodA great movie that absolutely shouldn't be missed, but I find The Terminator stands up much better to repeated viewing",7,19,32,26 June 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," True to the spirit of the comic books, this really is Spider-Man!
","People are entitled to their opinion but I grew up reading the comic books and this movie is far more accurate than Sam Raimi's efforts for a whole plethora of reasons Firstly Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is brilliant.. nerdy, witty all at the same time and precisely how he should be.. much better than the incredibly dull Tobey Maguire. This Spidey is expressive and energetic He also has the correct physique, slender and long limbed he looks perfect in the Spidey suit and has all the correct poses precisely as drawn in the comics. The suit is better and the effects on Spider-Man are also far better and look real.. I absolutely loved the web slinging sequence at the very end of the movie and that is the first time I have seen Spider-Man on screen.. I found it very moving to see that at last after imagining him in my head for so long reading the comic books He has web shooters. Hallelujah! There are some excellent casting choices.. I really liked Gwen (Peter's proper first girlfriend), Flash, Uncle Ben, Aunt May, Dr Connors and Captain Stacey too. The actors in this were superior pretty much across the board On the negative side, yes some liberties are taken with the storyline but it really didn't matter to me. The music wasn't memorable although the sound design more than made up for this. Also the lizard was a little chunky and didn't move very gracefully which made the fight scenes rather limited.. I would've preferred a smaller more wiry Lizard, this one looked a bit like a dinosaur But these are small criticisms and as a complete movie it beats Raimi's first Spider-Man (and probably matches his second one with Doc Ock). Judging by the ending during the credits it looks like the Green Goblin will be in the next one and after Raimi's completely horrible metallic Goblin I am really looking forward to finally seeing him on screen as he should be in Amazing Spider-Man 2 If you love the comic books then take the IMDb rating with a big pinch of salt because this really is Spider-Man!",9,2,4,30 November 2012
The Usual Suspects," Not all its cranked up to be
","while this is certainly not a bad film, i would not consider this movie to be classic material. it doesn't deserve the 8.7 or so rating is has here currentlywhile the plot twists are clever, the film always strikes me as distinctly hollow. mainly because Keyser Sozes' motivations are never given any clarity or urgency. we really have no real idea why this man has gone to all this incredible trouble to maintain anonymity. the background of the character could have been given more substance without compromising the mysteryon the flip side of that, if the aim was to maintain an air of mystery or the supernatural.. then the film falls short on that count also. the ending in particular is distinctly flawed. this man of mystery with no acquaintances would surely disappear independently. blend in to the background. not get a lift home afterin addition to that, i find some of the acting in this movie to be second rate. spacey plays more or less the same character he played in seven, and no one else here is exceptionaloverall this is still a good quality movie, but i would not regard it as a classic.one movie deserving of that accolade that was around shortly before this one, and a film that suspects borrows from rather massively (as did many movies made around that time) is pulp fiction. now that is a classic film. it has style, great acting and a substance and momentum that suspects truly lacks",6,10,18,14 October 2005
Quantum of Solace," A solid Bond movie and Casino Royale act 2
","The revitalized Bond is frequently compared to the Bourne series and while stylistically the same, it's the direction the franchise is taking right now so why not? My only real complaint with this is that there isn't enough humourOkay Bond's girlfriend just died but I had to wait around 50 minutes before I got a chuckle from Bond's comment about the handcuff's, and generally I found the movie improved with the appearance of Field's who is excellentThis movie picks up precisely where Casino Royale left off (the only Bond movie that I know of that has taken this approach).. the SMERSH agent, Mr White, that Bond kidnapped is now in the boot of his Aston Martin and he is being pursued on his way to meet MBond's main motive is to uncover Vesper's history and in particular to find out if she really loved him, and to do this he must infiltrate further into the QUANTUM organization who she worked with as a double agentMy main issue with QOS is that everything is too rushed, it's a very short film, and this really contrasts with the pacing of Casino Royale.. the editing in the car chase at the start of the movie for example is so hurried that it is barely watchable. Product placement is also o.t.t, and Bonds main gadget is basically his Sony Ericsson phone. Some unbranded and more imaginative gadgets would be niceThe ending of QOS is very good though and Bond finally gets closure on Vesper, who was basically manipulated into becoming a double agent by a person that did not even love her. Since she was manipulated, Bond can finally forgive Vesper6.7 puts this on a par with The Man with the Golden Gun and amongst some of the poorest rated Bonds, which is ridiculousA solid Bond movie. Recommended 7.5",7,4,11,16 April 2009
No Country for Old Men," a real aural treat
","there will be plenty of other reviews here on the story, acting etc etc but maybe less on the sound in the movie so i'll focus on that here..the Coen brothers are well known for paying close attention to detail in their soundtracks. i've always found in the past though that they have a tendency to go over the top with this, and the sound can become a little pretentious not so here. they don't try to do anything outlandish with the soundtrack but tremendous detail is placed on the effects and atmos in particular. just about everything sounds wonderful from the dropping of a bag, the uncurling of a wrapper to more 'interesting' sounds like the ricochet of a bullet from a metal bridge and of course the fantastic signature sound of our bad guy.. the nail/air gun. some wonderful atmos in the air duct for example, and even on the polished metal of a blown out door lock. subtle and excellent use of the surrounds is made, and i especially liked how they used this with some of the dialogue overall i was really impressed. and as you'll likely hear elsewhere, the rest of the film was great too!",10,96,193,9 November 2007
District 9," woefully overrated movie. true sci-fi heads should watch Moon instead
","Visual effects enthusiasts will love this movie. For me though the effects were nearly too good, causing the film makers to be lazy in the key areas of story and acting. The film makes very little sense and apparently tells us how intolerant humans are? Actually it doesn't, because there is no way we would invite an alien species onto our planet in the first place The contained area they get to live in is not secure at all, and the way that native South Africans and aliens interact with each other to develop weapons and so on is ridiculous. These creatures would be 100% quarantinedA huge space craft hovers above our planet and yet there is no urgency felt and no international response to this landmark event; the whole business is administered by South Africans. Would the UN not be there or the USA? How humans and aliens are able to chat with each other in their native languages also goes completely unexplained.It's only a movie though right?Okay so are people on this board who say this is a commentary about how white people treat other races serious then? how so? No in the real world humans, black/white/orange, are a lot more intolerant than depicted here. If you think this is some kind of racial commentary then you are a victim of marketing because that's what the film makers would like you to believe.I've heard a great deal of awe toward the sound in this movie, especially with the creature voices. When I closed my eyes during this film, as I did several times, I would often hear conversation going on between humans and aliens. My first thought was how wonderful the human voice is. How subtle, tonal and rich it is. The alien voices were interesting for no more than 5 minutes and didn't develop dramatically. Ben Burtt et al created dozens of voices as good and better nearly a quarter of a century ago The sound mix is distracting to the point where things coming out of the surrounds make no sense and completely detach you from the movie. An alien is in a cabin and outside only to the right we hear the main character outside, why? Is sound not supposed to be supportive of the story, the drama? if so why should sound distract us from that story What a tremendous waste of great visual effects work. Because if they were there to support a great story, acting, character development then what an outstanding movie really could have been madeIf you're a true sci-fi enthusiast do yourself a big favour and watch Moon instead",1,41,86,22 August 2009
28 Days Later...," great movie spoiled by a silly ending
","I agree with the last poster and was overwhelmed for the first two thirds or so which struck me as feeling starkly realistic in style, and then severely underwhelmed by the ending which I thought was very po-orI really thought once they found the compound that the plot would branch off into some interesting territory, instead it goes all Hollywood on us Forgetting about the ending, the movie still has a lot going for it including some solid acting. It also combines creative visuals, music and sound. The film has a surreal silence for the most part, creating a claustrophobia which I really liked. This contrasts nicely with the bursts of noise during rage attacks Also some nice details like the Foley on the eye opening at the start Pity the ending wasn't approached differently, but you can't always have everything, and overall I got a lot more than I was expecting. Infinitely better than the sequel",7,2,3,11 January 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," a silly sequel devoid of suspense
","even though the subject matter of the first movie was fantastical, what made it so intriguing was the possibility that with genetic advances.. maybe this might be feasible in the future the first movie also treated the dinosaurs with some respect even acknowledging that some breeds of dinosaur may have been able to think and work as teamson the island in this movie, the raptors must have bred themselves dumb. at one point, one of them even gets a kick in the face from an 8 year old gymnast. utterly ridiculous in the first movie dinosaurs are dangerous, once you go beyond the fences you're likely to get munched at any moment. in this film people wander around, shouting at each other seemingly in safe surroundings that they can control the movie tries to continue in the same style as the first, but with the new environment the whole story just comes crashing down like a sack of mouldy old spuds coming to a fantastic crappy crescendo",4,0,2,20 November 2005
The Incredibles," great start and finish... lags in the middle
","..far too much time is spent on boring island. what makes these characters funny is the interaction with their environment, so isolating them in the middle of nowhere for half of the movie was a poor decisionseeing the characters dealing with normal life is extremely funny. every once in awhile their super powers will sneak out to great comedic effect.. the household fight and the sections at work are brill. also mr incredible has let himself go a fair bit which makes for some great scenesits a pity that the larger storyline didn't mesh with their lives a lot better, taking place locally rather than on some far away islandthe incredibles family are brilliant, and their are some good supporting characters also. although i continue to question why they need big names for dialogue in animated movies, for me it's just a distraction. when i hear samuel l jackson, i see samuel l jackson and not the character i'm supposed to be seeing on the screensome of the sound effects in this movie are very impressive, especially the 'bendy' sounds for mrs incredible (formerly elastigirl). these must have been really tricky to create, and they did a tremendous job on themthe movie thankfully picks up again toward the end, with some very funny moments.... especially the part where baby incredible's power is revealed!!if they just could have linked A and B together with a more sophisticated storyline this film could have been incredible.. but the long bit in the middle seemed a lot like filler",7,0,1,4 July 2006
Kick-Ass," Lame-Ass
","I'd advise you to click on the username of each person giving this movie a 10 rating and you'll notice most of them have written no other reviews on IMDb. That is blatant ratings manipulation done to lure unsuspecting people into a movie theatreIf you're 14 you'll probably like this movie. If you are 18 you'll cringe. If you're any older than that you'll fall to sleep The movie is a big bunch of nothing, a 10 minute at best comedy sketch painfully stretched out to two hours duration. Funny for a short while and then strained - a crap parody of a crap movie trend toward superheros Nicolas Cage is okay in this but he's not in it enough to make any major impact I'm very sceptical that the target audience of this movie would be well organized enough to come onto IMDb and rate this movie at 8.4 so I can guess that people are either listening to the hype and not to their own intuition and/or that the rating for this film is being highly massagedA real dud",1,75,151,17 April 2010
Unknown," weak story
","okay so you can expect the victim of a car accident not to think too rationally but Unknown pushes this idea too far. Once Neeson is unable to prove his identity, having been rational enough to go to his hotel, surely the next place to go in a developed capital city (like in the Bourne Identity for example) would be his countries embassy Had Neeson made this realistic character action or attempted to then I would've been able to suspend my disbelief for any kind of fantastical plot that they fed me, but it doesn't and it bugged me throughout Had it happened then Unknown's plot would have needed to be more watertight and maybe wider in scope than it is, perhaps taking place in a lesser developed country a long way from a capital city would've been enough.. quite simple really Instead we're left with a movie with a weak story which otherwise could've been pretty good",5,2,3,28 December 2012
Children of Men," best original film i've seen in ages
","i'll have to say that this movie really took me by surprise. when it first started it seemed a little dull but i was rapidly and totally drawn in sound is used in the movie extremely cleverly, and we only hear certain things in order to give emotional impact. for example only the squeal of the train can be heard to indicate impending danger in one scene, they use tinnitus style sounds extremely well during explosive moments, other sounds are also of extremely high quality like the part where the motorcycle is toppled with the car door. wow. and the gun battle toward the end is simply superb, pure adrenalin. leagues above the sonic deluges we often hear these days fabulous performances are turned in by everyone. and what a breath of fresh air for a movie to clock in at just over 1 hour and 30 minutes. a perfect example of how less is morethis movie is fantastic and isn't just for sci-fi buffs either. take a look, i absolutely loved it!",9,3,6,14 May 2007
Mulholland Drive," David Lynch must be smiling..
","..at the 101 ways that people try to dissect and piece together this movie i've watched his film just twice, and on the second viewing i didn't try to concentrate on details i might have missed first time round. but instead just tried to relax about standard narrative structure and soak in the emotional content of the movie. 'don't think feeeel'! my conclusion is that this movie most certainly is not about love, it is 100% about obsession, jealousy, envy and all of those darker emotions acting-wise Naomi Watts has the most to do here, and does a tremendous job. most of all i like the scene where she is acting as if she is acting. pretty incredible actually",8,5,9,7 December 2007
Ip Man," a superb martial arts movie
","This is the most enjoyable martial arts themed movie that I have seen for a long time since Kung Fu Hustle. Although Ip Man is not comedic it does have some lighter moments especially early on (love the ass whoopin scene and the bit where his baby son comes in on the tricycle mid fight). Before that I would need to go all the way back to Bruce Lee to find a movie as good as this Ip Man is better than most movies of this genre because not only is it brilliantly acted and made, but it is something more and loosely tells the story of Yip Man, creator of the Wing Chun school of martial arts (and one of Bruce Lee's teachers), and his life during World War II and the Japanese occupation of China Admittedly I would not like to be Japanese and watching this movie, but if you leave your politics and nationality at the door and just enjoy Ip Man as a good martial arts movie you will really enjoy this A very special nod to the soundtrack which is brilliant. The fight scenes are very loud generally but the sound design is first rate, every main impact sounds fresh and different and there are some very nice double impacts and weapons sounds which really add crunch to the fight scenes Very impressive!",9,0,1,29 December 2012
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Johnny and the Chocolate Factory
","Johnny Depp delivers another trade mark 'quirky' performance, but in this movie its thoroughly o.t.t and out of place, and he is given far far too much screen time the wonder of this story, i.e the chocolate factory, is totally consumed by Depps performance here to the point where the chocolate itself does not even seem desirable. it looks more like Bovril! on top of this, scenes which worked brilliantly in the 70's version like when Augustus gets sucked up the pipe, seem rubbish here. even more disappointing are the Oompa Loompas, which were so good in the original version. and the Oompa Loompa song in this movie is totally uninspired in comparison Gene Wilder made for a much better and more mysterious Willy Wonka, whereas Depp seems to do a Michael Jackson impression throughout given that Burton has come up with inferior versions of at least two great movies now, perhaps it's time to stop trying",3,2,4,9 February 2008
The Dark Knight," A cool take on the Joker and Two Face's origins
","The Dark Knight pretty much dispenses with presenting the idea that the Joker fell into a vat of chemicals, and the smile is actually sliced into his face here. Like the comic books though the characters origins remain mysterious and the Joker changes the story every time Heath Ledger plays the character tremendously well, and his body, his eyes, mouth or hair are in constant nervous motion. The take on the character, the performance, combined with Ledger's unfortunate departure make the character extremely morbid and unnerving. I actually found him difficult to watch The Joker is Batman's nemesis and arrives on the scene in the Dark Knight just as Batman, Dent and Gordon are restoring some order to Gotham with a combination of fear, law and hard policing.It's revealed during the movie that the Joker preys on and enlists people who have inherent psychological problems and so he goes for Dent, the weakest link who already has issues and a penchant for making decisions on the flip of a coin, to bring down the triumvirate and invite chaos and anarchy back to the city Batman and Gordon try to lure the Joker into a trap, and find that the Joke is on them This is an extremely dark movie, even more so than Begins, and should satisfy the most die hard of Batman fans. In particular, those who appreciate the real darkness of the characters as depicted in the graphic novels 'The Killing Joke' and 'The Long Halloween', from which the movie draws heavily There are some brilliant action sequences including an extremely cool part where Batman's bike is emergency ejected from the car, some amazing sound and editing work, a storyline that has real depth, and some perfect performances including Oldman who is absolutely outstanding here",9,1,4,24 July 2008
Into the Wild," mostly conjecture
","i'm going to resist giving my opinion here on this guys actions, because it's not my place to do so and because most of this movie is fiction sown together by some facts.. what we know is: Christopher, graduated, went travelling (like thousands of graduates do every year), naturally met some people along the way, and died on his travelswe know very little about his behaviour, his motivations, the order of his writings, his past, his plans for the future or the reasons for his death although it seems that he intended to be in Alaska for just a few months before moving on perhaps to a life of perpetual travel or a life as a rich lawyer who can say. it does appear that he made a pretty bloody remarkable kayaking trip which I'd like to know more about and which should perhaps have been the focus of the film i would expect that the main character had a love of nature, and i found this was totally lost in this movie. the wild is pretty much depicted as being alien, hostile, claustrophobic, and something merely there to be conquered. i didn't feel at any moment that Penn has a love of nature. surely it needs to be at the heart of this movie otherwise we risk describing a person without purpose. i actually found that Penn revels in this concept, and paints his romantic notion of a nihilistic central character. maybe his interpretation is right, maybe it's wrong. but either way going to Alaska is clearly a big deal for the guy, so why not show us more joy instead of focusing on his death and rewinding from that point? given the lack of concrete information i wonder why this movie was made as a factual account. it would have been more sensible to leave it alone and make a movie about all those fabulous people, perhaps like Christopher, that go travelling with purpose and end up doing something very special instead of tragically starving to death alone in a broken bus",4,6,8,11 May 2009
Green Street Hooligans," probably interesting for international viewers but not authentic
","I won't pretend to know anything about football hooliganism because I don't although I likely know and am perhaps related to a few people that do, have been a hammers fan all my life and know bits and pieces about the icf, enough to know that it's not like this. The people involved are normally not very complicated people.. like fighting, are racist, have a passing interest in football and that's about it I also have an extremely good ear for an authentic East London accent and Charlie Hunnan's accent is all over the map.. ending up somewhere in between London, Newcastle and New York, in the sea. A real pity because he is a central character in the movie and the role should've been cast better, it quickly eroded any interest I had in the movie. Some of the more minor characters do have good accents, eg. Leo Gregory and Ross McCall sound better I didn't get the music choices either.. Stone Roses etc, there was nothing particularly London-orientedI don't want to spoil it completely for international viewers because without knowing any of the above you will likely enjoy Green Street Hooligans and it might give you some insights, it was indeed recommended to me by a Canadian which is quite ironic :)",5,1,1,19 August 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," Predated Star Wars by nearly 10 years and Alien by 11
","Every time I see this movie I am in disbelief that it could've been made in 1968, that's before Woodstock. People at the time must've been absolutely blown awayThe effects, the colours and the lines are absolutely beautiful. As are the silence, the music, the orchestral dronesThis is a great movie in it's own right and without it we would not have had Alien, Blade Runner and probably not Star Wars either which would've had a domino effect throughout recent film/TV history and gaming history too - no Battlestar Galactica, no Dead Space2001 surely changed the ballpark and for that it would have to be considered as one of the most important movies ever madeFor those of you that find the movie boring, you're not abnormal. Yes it is a slow movie even boring at times, yes I thought the part where he retrieves his buddy from space was way too long. But we have the technology now, if you want fast then watch it at double speed if you have to. It still beats cgi and what we have now for realism to my eyes. It is a visual and sonic masterpiece",9,1,6,6 January 2012

It instead highlighted how lacking in substance the movie was. it in no way for one moment even came closethe idea is good and so the problem is in the execution, especially the casting of the lead roles. I didn't at any point feel that Winslet and Carrey were in love with each other which is kinda an important ingredient for this film to workI never really liked Winslet much to be honest, I find her very self absorbed and self indulgent and she never really appears to give anything on screen to her co actors. Jim Carrey is okay but feels shallow in this one. overall him and Winslet just do not feel like a good match at all. probably Carrey and Dunst would've been a more interesting couplein terms of production values I saw or heard nothing exceptional. visually and sonically I found the movie very grey",3,2,5,11 March 2012

The Wind that Shakes the Barley," who are we supposed to sympathise with here?
","i found this to be a very interesting film but it seemed that our sympathies were meant to lie with the main character Damien, and yet i found myself sympathising instead with his brother Teddy. i'm not sure this is what the director intended the English, obviously, are presented as being 100% animal trash. that's fair enough given the subject matter being dealt with here but the films flaws reveal themselves through the more delicate subject matter; the parting of the ways of two main factions within the republican movement expressed through the ideological and emotional separation of two brothers.personally i saw Teddy's path as the harder one at this point, and more admirable.one odd scene that made me feel uneasy was the section where politics became the domain of a local church, and the priest there was presented as being some kind of aggressive dictator as evidenced from this scene my general feeling is that the director is trying to make us side with the hard liners, and if that is the case then i think the film fails a thought provoking film though and generally acted to a very high standard",6,3,7,23 June 2007
Sicario," disappointing and lacking Michael Mann style authenticity
","i had very high hopes for this movie, with the general buzz surrounding director Denis Villeneuve, who also directed Arrival (which I thought was OK and not great) and who is now directing Blade Runner 2 which I no longer have high hopes for after seeing this..the movie lacks basic authenticity and this gets worse as the story progresses, culminating with the ending.. we are expected to believe that a Mexican drug boss one down from the top of the food chain will drive alone at night through the desert, and that the big boss himself has 4 bodyguards the way that the central female character becomes a snivelling girl and pawn at the end, is also highly disappointing, and more than a bit patronisingtechnically i thought the night vision camera scenes looked and sounded really cheap, and the sound mix is all over the map throughout the movie, I haven't had to ride the volume button so much in quite a while Michael Mann is the master of authenticity when it comes to this type of movie, he gets details right, and he makes Villeneuve look extremely amateur",6,1,2,7 January 2017
Rocky III," probably the second best Rocky after the first one
","Rocky 3 has a lot going for it in terms of characters - we have Mr T, Hulk Hogan, Rocky and Apollo Creed all in one story and at times it feels like a superhero movie, in a good way The moral of the story is actually a very good one and is relevant to many people's lives at some stage.. we lose our way and need to find it again, perhaps with help and come back stronger than before Rocky has to dig deep and go back to his roots, and back to the sweat and tears to rediscover the 'Eye of the Tiger' in order to match his opponent Clubber Lang in grit and hunger. To do this he returns to the streets and learns some new skills from ex-champ and mentor Apollo Creed Somehow, cut down muscle tops, short shorts, and long socks, sometimes headbands, are acceptable in the ghetto and this culminates in some very shady scenes with Rocky and Apollo jumping and hugging each other on the beach in slow motion Also Stallone takes a hammer and chisel to Burgess Meredith's (Mick's) greatest acting moment on his death bed with some really stupid vocals which only Stallone knows how to makeBut otherwise this is a rock solid movie and very entertaining For those interested it has some unexpectedly good sound design features. Some really varied game-like slo-mo heavy hits from Clubber and Thunderlips. Also the death rattle as Mick expires his last breath is very nicely done Overall, recommended",7,0,0,24 December 2011

","this movie is completely inferior to Infernal Affairs on just about every level possibleIA anticipated an audience with a brain cell or two, and so explains during the title sequence what it takes this remake around 30 minutes or more to explain. repeat, during the *title sequence* we are given all of the information we need to know about the informant plants (which btw were realistically placed some considerable time in the past, rather than several months ago) and are then straight into the moviescorsese takes this fabulous material and then dumbs it down to spoon feed it to a western audience. all of the sharp and intelligent dialogue of the original is gone in favour of your usual Hollywood 4 word expletives. every other word in this film is an F word, and they are mostly totally unnecessary. all of the stylish camera work of the original is lost, for example the ultra cool roof top meets. and to top it the casting and performances are dry and badnicholson gives us a performance which is no more than good old bottled vintage jack. here's jack doing an impression of a rat etc etc, yawn.di caprio is good as usual but still doesn't nail the performance mostly because he doesn't physically suit the part. he just doesn't look tough enough for the challenge (as presented in the departed)wahlberg on the other hand tough's it up to the Nth degree, and is just absolutely atrocious. this man is working in a high level intelligence department and he plays it like a street cop. it's a totally inappropriate display and really reveals his limitations as an actormatt damon is just too plain, he is just totally unmemorable in this moviefor a director who used to be at the cutting edge of cinema, this is a fat and lazy remake of a lean and mean original movie/trilogy which i urge you strongly to see. time for scorsese to hit the gym and go back to basicsfor people unaware of the original i'm sure they'll be blown away by the incredibly intricate plot in scorsese's departed. unfortunately what they probably won't know is that this is a dumb rehash of Infernal Affairs",1,53,91,31 December 2006
Jaws," one of my favourites
","Jaws is one of those films that i have seen multiple times throughout my life, and unlike many other things it just seems to get better with age the most important thing about the movie are the central characters.. Brody, Quint and Hooper. the three characters are very different to each other (slightly hippie academic rich kid, hard as nails working fisherman, and kinda edgy/disillusioned police/everyman) but they are brought together by a common goal. and the scene where they all get drunk and exchange shark stories is just brilliant. Shaw's recollection of events on the U.S.S Indianapolis is one of my favourite scenes in any movie, and he acts it brilliantly Brody, the cop that tried to get an easy life is fabulous as well, and he, Quint and Hooper share an entertaining rapport throughout.all of this, and the shark hasn't even gotten mention yet! i try to forget about the shark actually as this film made me afraid of the water as a child. and even though i've faced my fear since, I'm still scared witless of big sharks and this film is the reason!!! in actual fact the shark isn't a big deal and the parts where it starts leaping out of the water are less effective compared to what you don't see earlier on. and i'm certain that the shark scenes in this movie are small fry anyway by todays horror standards the movie uses a lot of real world footage so it captures a really nice authentic essence of the 70's. and the part where Brody flicks through the book on actual shark attacks brings the movie into the real world the sound in the movie is of course very memorable, and the jaws theme straddles the line between music and sound in an interesting way. also very nice underwater sound mixed abruptly with 'normal' sound as the camera breaks the surface of the water. i love that sound at the very start of the movie also just before the tune starts, which i think is a pod of whales or something like that. very cool anywayi'm not sure that the new generation would enjoy this movie so much for thrills, but for me this is a 100% classic",9,2,5,23 January 2008
Sherlock Holmes," A fresh slant on a classic character
","For those more familiar with the deerstalker hat and cape which is how Holmes was depicted pictorially only, this version of Sherlock Holmes may come as a surprise. Ritchie draws out some of Holmes' lesser known traits here such as his bohemian nature; often high, slightly bedraggled and manic depressive off the job, and sometimes on it. These are accurate character traits, and the Holmes in need of some TLC comes straight out of Conan Doyle's stories.So while Downey Jr doesn't look like the typical Holmes image and Sidney Paget's drawings of the character, his look stubble aside is more in keeping with Doyles writings and I did find him an interesting Holmes (though if it'd been me I'd have wanted Paul Bettany for the part). Downey Jr and Law obviously click well off screen and this shows in their performances. They have an excellent and witty rapport and I look forward to future instalments with these two Judging from the trailers I was expecting this film to be Sherlock Holmes the comedy. Having read all of the Holmes stories several times over, I was slightly disappointed at this prospect, but luckily this is more a darkly humorous action movie - the trailers actually just show the most obviously funny moments back to back. Overall Ritchie goes for a reasonably serious if slightly shallow and super hero styled update to the character We're dipped straight into the life of Holmes and Watson, in keeping with the original stories, and there are no boring introductions or origins filler to sit through. the plot is otherwise quite unlike any of Conan Doyles original stories though, more like a comic book, and I think this is the films weakest link. There's certainly lots of murder and mystery on offer but the story lacks the finesse of Doyles writings In terms of the films component parts I loved the score which was constantly interesting. The visuals are stunning with London looking suitably smoky and mysterious.The film includes some great action set pieces and I think audiences young and old will be satisfied with this Sherlock Holmes. While I'm most definitely not a fan of Guy Ritchie's past endeavours, I think he has made a creative resurgence here after dumping some old baggage",8,3,5,26 December 2009
Prometheus," better enjoyed if not viewed as a direct prequel to Alien
","Prometheus is not an Alien prequel and so does not explain everything in Alien, although it does reveal the larger back story to itThe most important difference is that Prometheus takes place on LV223, not LV426 of Alien/s (apparently these are in the same star system but orbit different suns) and so in Prometheus we are not seeing the craft filled with eggs and pilot from Alien, which confused me somewhat on first viewing. What happens is this..At the start we see our creators spreading their genetic code, via the ingestion of a mysterious compound, to earth-like planets in the long distant past (This would have benefited from a longer sequence showing the humanoid actually being dropped off)Fast forward to 2089 and archaeologists, including Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her profoundly annoying boyfriend find cave drawings in Scotland showing a star system that we believe to be our origin planet (it appears our creators visited us again at some point, giving this info to multiple civilisations on earth). We jump, rather quickly, from the Isle of Skye to a huge space craft named Prometheus heading to this apparent origin planet with our archaeologists on boardThey arrive and find pyramid-like structures with craft and dead pilots inside like those in Alien. But instead of eggs there are vials of goo (the primordial goo that presumably came before, or maybe after, the egg? and is probably the same thing the gene spreader ingested at the start of the film, or some more sinister derivative designed to do harm). These pilot humanoids, for reasons yet unknown, are about to undo the gene spreading activities that gave birth to mankind, probably this is because we did not turn out as intended (see next movie). Before they could blast off though something went wrong.. the primordial goo somehow escaped and wiped them out etc..With science fiction while the larger story can be quite fantastical it needs to be held together by believable character actions, and this is the glue that holds it together. In the case of Alien the glue was super glue, but in the case of Prometheus it is more like pritt stickSilly things happen and their scientific expedition is like a badly supervised school tripEg., immediately after arriving at their destination about half the crew take a trip to one of the structures without analysing the atmosphere in detail like they do in Alien. Once they realise the air inside is breathable off come the helmets with no regard for safety against contaminants in the air? This disregard towards safety continues as they touch the black goo with their fingers, perform uncontained ancient head autopsies, sleep with goo, play with snake like creatures which clearly look dangerous and ready to bite, open doors to let contaminated zombie people in exorcist style spider positions back onto the ship etc (again completely unrealistic next to Alien where Ripley was not going to allow Brett back onto the ship at all). Also not one, but three people decide to perform a kamikaze manoeuvre on the say so of Shawthere are good performances in the movie especially Fassbender and Rapace. some really nice visual effects and sound, especially the Prometheus movement and landing. The main score theme is ill fitting though and sounds like something out of Brokeback Mountainthere are some ridiculous scenes though like those described.. in Alien we can forgive the Nostromo crew being a bit stupid because they are a mining vessel sidetracked to deal with something they are not trained for, but here we have scientists playing with alien snakes and removing their helmets just because the air is breathableoverall though I enjoyed Prometheus, the plot is difficult to understand and I am sure the average non Alien fan would not have had a clue what was going on but I'm sure it will all be tied up in the sequel",8,2,10,25 June 2012
Wonder Woman," If Wonder Woman is so worried about people, why does she slaughter so many German soldiers?
","I did quite like some aspects of this movie especially the first half and some of the humour, also there was good chemistry between the two leads, and Wonder Woman was well acted, powerful and strong. the actress playing her was amazing and fully in the zoneIt falls down though in the second half when the super hero patriotism slips in, it does not make sense with Wonder Woman since she is not an American or from an Ally nation but from somewhere completely different. She has deep concern for humanity and so comes through time to save us, and then decides herself to go over the top of the trenches and slaughter countless German soldiers on the battlefield. Surely as someone with no preconceptions or bias she must see that there is good and bad on both sides and that the German foot soldiers are not the ones to blame, why not go straight for the Nazi high command and Hitler?The enemy is set up to be interesting too, with some nasty villains to take care of including the dastardly Dr Poison, but the story never really goes in the right elaborate direction to make the most of itInstead we get a twist ending and a very standard superhero boss fightA reasonable movie but did not meet by high expectations of it unfortunately",6,0,1,17 January 2019
Vanilla Sky," too explicit
","i found this movie really intriguing right up to the moment where cruise starts running around screaming for 'tech support'..until then you had this extremely interesting plot with tremendous depth, little in the way of clarity but with an underlying notion that maybe this guy had opted for cryonic freezing at some point (we see/hear adverts for the procedure from time to time)i could have happily watched the movie until the end without having the heart of the storyline pushed in my face, left instead to figure it out for myself but no, we are effectively told the plot in the style of a scooby doo episode in usual Hollywood dumbed down fashion. and we're left afterward only to figure out, if we can be bothered, which parts of the film are 'real' and which parts aren'tthe film is certainly very weird, and stays with you. but it could have been a great deal better if the makers hadn't been tempted to go for exposure and cheap laughs with the 'tech support' nonsense. for me, that section turned it into a joke movie",5,1,2,30 December 2006
The Dark Knight Rises," as good if not better than the Dark Knight
","contrary to what many others are saying I thought this was a better movie to the previous two. It doesn't have the Heath Ledger factor but I personally found the Dark Knight's ending with the boats a little underwhelming. Not so here, the Dark Knight Rises is excellently paced and it builds from the outset to an incredible finale Bane is a intimidating villain, and this version is a really dark take on the character. I'm sure kids will be scared witless. Yes his voice is hard to understand at times but the audio effect used is really nice, and actually once we hear him a little more clearly like in the football stadium he becomes less ominous. We never actually get to see his face and it is amazing to think Tom Hardy is under there, he looks massive and very powerfulThe best thing about Catwoman is that no one actually refers to her as Catwoman. I had my doubts about Anne Hathaway's ability to pull it off but she really is magnificent, as memorable as Michelle Pfeiffer but a completely different more real world take on the character in keeping with the rest of Nolan's films. No proper cat costume but every bit as feline, she plays a person torn between her slightly villainous nature, and her good side and love of Batman perfectly Ra's al Ghul is also woven beautifully into the story, everything is seamless and it really is brilliant story telling with a lovely twist at the end with the very lovely Marion Cotillard which luckily I had not read about.. it was a great bookend to a trilogy which must be the best ever madeI find it difficult to believe that Bale will not return for another episode or two despite what he says, he really is brilliant. The ending is left perfectly open ended with an introduction to Robin - Gordon Levitt is a great choice and from what I have seen is one of the most promising young actors around right now A special nod to the audio in the movie which is really incredible throughout especially when Gotham explodes, also some nice Catwoman versions of the score which reminded me of Nick Arundel's work on Arkham CityFor those that say this is not the proper Batman.. in the first episode Batman was trained by ninjas and that was not in the comic books until 1989. Nolan made it very clear from Begins that he was reinterpreting Batman in a more modern and realistic way, so if you're a Batman purist who likes the golden age style Batman then technically you should've given up after the first movie. Bane is not a guy twice Batman's size who drank the venom formula with tubes protruding from his body, he is a tough and gritty mercenary of realistic proportions. Similarly The Joker didn't use chemicals, electric shock hands and laughing false teeth he used knives and dirty explosives more like the darker Joker from the graphic novels. The theme has been very consistent throughout the trilogy and it has been an awesome journey. This is an outstanding end to it",9,5,10,28 July 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard 4 point Zero
","with a UK title like that i should have sensed the dangers... unfortunately this chapter of Die Hard tries to be far too tech savvy, and i eventually lost patience with all the downloading and uploading in the end overall i found that Bruce, who must be the number 1 draw for any Die Hard movie, got lost under the weight of all the tech gadgetry i also found the storyline to be quite strained. things get off to a nice start but then we find ourselves on a quiet drive up to Minnesota on the back of a hunch(?)... then on the way back the young fella spots a friends house from a helicopter in darkness so they stop off there for help. it all seems very disjointed and a lot of time is wasted during these set pieces. if the story had been put together more cohesively then all that travel time would not have been necessary i was also very disappointed with the quality of some of the dialogue editing in this movie. lots of lines delivered while people have their mouths closed etc. dialogue which is tonally out of place. quite shoddy actually, and why? just so this title could get released on 4th July? why was that necessary? i also found Bruce Willis's on screen daughter to be fiercely irritating, constantly delivering one liners in a really poorly acted mannerworthy of a 6 because it's good mindless entertainment (the warplane section at the end was utterly ridiculous) but i expect more from a Die Hard movie given the quality of the first instalment and the calibre of Willis",6,2,5,5 July 2007
Munich," has much more depth than it is given credit for here
","perhaps some people need the subtleties to be made a little more obvious. rather than have the WTC towers in the distance at the end, spielberg should have done an extreme close up shot also leave any baggage you may have at home before going to see this film. luckily for me i sit squarely on the fence, and have no admiration for either side on the subject of israel and palestine that out the way, lets talk about the movie... firstly Bana's performance has to be given a serious amount of credit here. fantastic casting. Daniel Craig is also amazing. consider for one moment what this movie would have been like with george clooney and brad pitt as the leads, the latter would be trying every obvious trick in the book to steal scenes. Craig on the other hand thoroughly leaves Bana space to perform and yet still manages to grab your attention the score is also tense and gripping. costume and makeup really capture the era and show Bana's gradual physical disintegration from tanned and healthy to gaunt and world weary the film straddles the line very well avoiding favouritism for either side. israel of course comes of worse as a result... Banas team slowly become jaded and uncertain about who they are working for. this sets the stage very well for the real world developments that were to occur later on down the line with 911 and its aftermath. A number of questions are intelligently presented here if you allow yourself to be receptive to them. for example how many leaderless 'teams' have been available in recent years, open for manipulation? and what would they be capable?Mixed with some exciting action scenes, this is a tight story and is presented with good length. Go see it.",10,0,0,12 February 2006
Fantastic Four," the farcical four
",around half way through the movie i just wondered what kind of movie i was watching.. we have the origins of the fantastic four which then just diverts into a number of inconsequential set pieces: the thing goes back to see his missus(?). the thing helps a guy about to commit suicide. jessica alba as the invisible woman gets a chance to shed her clothes yet again in a movie. someone needs to show alba how to act with her eyes because she's as lively as a blowup doll herethe movie tries too hard to be funny and pretty much makes a mockery of the fantastic four. i'll have to say that i always thought the ff were pretty lame anyway but they surely deserve better than this,3,0,2,7 June 2009
Moon," people who found this movie boring have plenty of other options available
","It's very encouraging to see that movies like this can still be made today because the future of film has been looking very bleak lately I had a discussion very recently about how suspense has disappeared from movie making, and how movies even as recent as Alien would not be made anymore. This discussion was prompted by district 9 which I found to be 100% show and no substance, a quite ludicrous movie Moon has certainly restored my faith in cinema, and especially in lower budget cinema. This film is low on show and all about substance - fabulous acting, story, direction. With understated but artistic visual effects and sound It's rare that art movie meets sci-fi, and the two come together spectacularly well here. The result is that we have a sci-fi movie that actually has something to say about an extremely relevant and under-discussed issue, that of cloning (you know the growth of stem cells and the leeching of life, so that Joe Celebrity can have a few less wrinkles on their botox) and the questionable ethical future that we might be building for ourselves as a species It makes me smile when I read comments from people that find this kind of film making boring. If that is you then no worries huh? You can take your pick from just about every other movie screened this year, i.e p^ss off and go watch Transformers. Heathen",10,3,5,30 August 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," gutsy move with a constantly varying visual frame rate
","I watched Fury Road in 2d, and when I first started watching it I thought something was wrong with the picture, but after five minutes or so it became evident that the selective, perhaps sometimes random, variance in the frame rate from shot to shot was a stylistic choice probably made by George Miller It was brave because the effect is extremely unsettling (epileptics should probably avoid this), and probably won't be everyone's cup of tea, so the choice could've easily backfired. The viewer is never able to settle into a scene and it keeps the intensity high, the only respite being when they reach the Green Place and the frame rate is normal for a few minutes Charlize Theron is extremely strong and in my opinion steals the show or at least shares it equally with Hardy who is like a crazed animal through most of the movie.. and as usual Hardy does a fine job doing it. Easily one of the best actors around right now, his vocal delivery is a little bit Bane-like, and his Max is like a Bronson/Bane fusion My only slight complaint was the soundtrack.. the music is 'diegetic' (Zzzz) and coming from drummers and a guitarist who are part of the War Boys pursuing convoy. It could've been handled better but it does add to the mayhem. Otherwise the sound design is a standard summer blockbuster mass of whooshes and rumbles, and badly needs something like Max's signature V8 Interceptor which would've cut through the noise like a knifeI'm a big fan of the original two movies, especially the second one and I still found Fury Road to be an amazing experience. This is 100% an action movie though so do not expect to see a standard story, it's basically one long road chase, even more extreme than Road WarriorOverall destined to become a cult classic and crying out to be watched a second time at least. Just wish Max's trademark car had been in the movie more, hopefully next time..",9,1,12,5 July 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," when compared to Raiders this movie is quite average
","I've watched Crusade many many times over the years and for some reason it just does not captivate me throughout.. the opening is okay although not a patch on the first, and also not as good as the diamond/antidote scene in the second movie After the opening it then cuts to a very bad scene on a boat which is all shot really close, no distant perspectives at all. I remember when the movie came out and they showcased this scene, saying how it was all done in a real water chamber, but the result is very claustrophobic and doesn't feel like a real boat at all (again unlike Raiders!) Things get better when Connery is introduced but thereafter it is all slapstick humour. While Raiders had some very funny scenes, it was still quite a dark movie and it had contrast, Temple of Doom was basically a kids movie but still had a dark theme, but Crusade really doesn't let up at all on the funny one liners. Indy's love interest is also easily the blandest of them all The music in the Crusade is also quite irritating.. Raiders had lots of music too and John Williams is well known for his Mickey Mousing, but here it is taken to extremes and there really is hardly a quiet moment, even the final poignant scenes with the Knight aren't left untouched If you've never seen Crusade then it is still a must see, I'm still fond of the movie and give it a 7 but for vintage Indy and a true classic, Raiders is the only one in the series that measures up",7,2,5,6 October 2012
