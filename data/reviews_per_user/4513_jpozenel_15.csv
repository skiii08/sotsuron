Catch Me If You Can," I enjoyed it
","I'm not going to try to over analyze this movie.  I just liked it.  It reminded me of 'The Great Imposter' with Tony Curtis (1961), but was done better (in my opinion.)  I haven't seen too many movies with Leonardo DiCaprio that I really cared for, but this is one of them.  I gave it 8 out of 10.  I was entertained.  Maybe you will be too.",8,1,2,16 June 2003
The Hangover," Definitely over-hyped
","It's hard for me to believe that this movie has a rating of 8 stars, while I feel that I'm being extremely generous giving it 6 stars. It kind of reminds me of when I saw Slumdog Millionaire last year which was also a movie that was over-hyped until it actually won the best picture award. That was a complete travesty. This movie, though not nearly as bad as Slumdog, certainly doesn't deserve the praise that I've been hearing.It won the Golden Globe award a few nights ago for 'Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy'. Now that I've seen it, that is so hard to believe. The only other movie that was nominated in that category that I have watched so far was 'Julie & Julia', which I thought was a better movie. I'm sure that after I see the other movies nominated in that category, there will probably be a couple more that I would rate higher than 'The Hangover'. I can't say that positively, but I feel pretty certain that will be the case.This movie, like Slumdog will be forgotten in a few years by most, but will still unfortunately be in the record books. And all the 10 star ratings? I think a lot of people saw this movie drunk because they felt that it was the appropriate thing to do!",6,1,3,20 January 2010
I'm Not There," Absolutely ridiculous
","I may have seen worse movies in my life, but I can't remember what they were. This one I will remember. This one I will tell everyone that I know is not worth watching.The reviews that praise this movie go on and on, paragraph after paragraph, trying to describe what it is about this move that is so great. In the end, they are just as pretentious and make no more sense than the movie itself.There's a 10 line minimum required for me to make a comment. It's a shame. This movie can be reviewed in one line.It's absolutely ridiculous, self-indulgent, pretentious garbage.",1,33,50,21 August 2009
The Others," Excellent acting, very good story
","Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan were both excellent in this movie. The story was quite good, but the interaction between their characters made the movie for me.  I never paid much attention to Nichole Kidman until just recently.  I guess it was because she was married to Tom Cruise who, for the most part, I consider to be just an awful actor.  I was wrong to discount her acting ability because of their association. Still, I can't see what she ever saw in him and I'm not surprised that it's over between them.
As far as other people's comments about the story being a rip-off of the Sixth Sense, I feel that kind of thinking is ridiculous.  Both movies where very good and I enjoyed them equally (maybe the Sixth Sense a bit more.)  It never even crossed my mind until I read some of the other IMDB comments. Why can't people just allow themselves to be entertained without being so negative and looking for fault with everything?  They remind me of the people that used to write letters to the editors of the Superman and Batman comic books when I was a kid, that were always trying to point out errors. They just can't allow themselves to be happy.",8,1,2,22 June 2003
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Very overrated
","Currently the movie is rated at 7.9* on IMDb. I feel that I'm probably being far too generous giving the movie a 4* rating. One of the comments that I just read was 'Despite the grim expectations from the story synopsis, the film delivers gore in a surprisingly tasteful way.' What? The movie is nothing but a pointless bloodbath set to bad songs. The story isn't a comedy, but some viewers treated it as though it were. There were some tragic moments in the movie but no surprises at all. I just don't think that this type of story should be a musical. I like Johnny Depp generally, but not very much in this movie. He never seems to play any adult roles. I always thought the best movies that I had seen him in were What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Edward Scissorhands. But neither one of those roles were very adult either. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies were big successful movies, but again not for adults in my opinion. Let's face it, this is nothing but another Johnny Depp movie for all his adoring fans who think that he is a genius. Like I said, I do generally like him, but a genius he is not.",4,0,1,22 August 2008
Drive," Dropped my rating of 8 to 6 because of the terrible soundtrack.
","There seems to be a growing trend of using 'pop' songs as a bigger and bigger part of the soundtrack in movies. I've seen quite a bit of this being done on television shows and increasingly in movies. It just seems lazy to me.If they had paid someone to create a 'real' soundtrack, the movie would have been so much better. I was watching the extras on the DVD and someone (I think it was the producer) compared this movie with 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Bullitt'. If they had been using this silly technique to create soundtracks from a mixed bag of 'pop' songs back then, what a sad experience watching those movies would have been.I would love it if they would re-release this movie with a real soundtrack. And I'm pretty sure that all of the actors involved would support that idea. They probably thought that they were going to create a pretty good movie but were disappointed when they saw the result with that lousy soundtrack. For me the movie went from a letter grade of 'B' to a 'D' (80% down to 60%) because of that alone.Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, The Coen Brothers, Paul Thomas Anderson, and all of the other big time directors will start doing the same. Nah...I don't think so. Why? Because it would be stupid! Just imagine if the greatest movies from the past used this technique. It's laughable.",6,0,4,8 February 2012
Across the Universe," Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but very close to it
","It was one of those movies that couldn't be over with fast enough for me. It was utterly boring and I kept hoping that something profound would happen to change my mind. That doesn't happen.I must agree with another comment that I read. This is more or less a dumbing down of history during the 60's. The feel of the 60's just wasn't there at all. I was born in 1950, so I did experience the period. I joined the Army reserves to avoid being drafted (not a good move today) and staying out of Vietnam. I listened to a little transistor radio in bed every night to song requests from young girls nearly in tears who had boyfriends or husbands that were in Vietnam. Sometimes the requests for dead soldiers or sailors. After the requests they always played 'Mister Lonely' by Bobby Vinton. Nearly 60,000 Americans were killed in the Vietnam war. We saw it on the 6 o'clock news every night. This movie doesn't capture any of this. It was a dark period in American history, not a musical.The singing was okay but the entire 'story' was so contrived just to fit Beatle songs to it. The attempt is really lame. Most of the characters had names that are in the lyrics of Beatle songs, that were eventually sung during the course of the movie (no surprise there).I don't make too many comments about movies, but if this help people take notice of how bad this movie really is, then I feel like I'm doing my part. This is a really bad movie.",1,4,7,17 May 2008
Big Fish," It just doesn't live up to the hype.
","I had heard nothing but glowing praise for this movie, but I found it to be only slightly entertaining.  After reading through some of the other IMDB comments, I'm relieved to see that I'm not the only one who thought so. 
The exaggerated stories and special effects did little for me.  Even the ending was somewhat predictable.  A good cast was put together to make the movie, but there wasn't any outstanding acting.  I don't think there was enough of a story line or truly memorable characters for anyone to stand out.  I did like much of the soundtrack, which of course contains lots of hit songs from the 50s and 60s, like so many other movies I've seen before.There's really nothing special about this movie.  I gave it a 6 out of 10. I was considering a 7, but it's really not that good.",6,2,3,10 May 2004
The Descent," Six drama queens in a cave without a brain between them all.
","After the first 30 minutes of this movie I wished that I had just ejected it and forgot about it. I developed such a disdain for every one of the characters in the movie that I just didn't care what happened to them. In fact, I hoped something terrible would.I felt no empathy toward any of them. What a bunch of losers. I can think of some pretty bad movies that I've seen, but this one might just take the cake. Six tough-talking women turned to a bunch a cry-baby little girls. A couple looked real tough at the end, but you knew that was the most fictional part of the story. Anyone who thinks that this movie is anything other than just plain bad is an idiot. How can this movie be rated so high? No way! Somebody is stuffing the ballot box here.",1,13,24,3 March 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I don't get it...
","Why all the glowing comments?  This is one lame movie.  Haven't we seen these types of special effects enough already?  The acting was lame.  The story was lame.  The pace was slow.  The scenes overly long and trite.  I was bored out of my mind.  I don't really think that most children would honestly like the movie very much except for the fact that it's been hyped so much.  They probably have collected all the toys and such that go along with the marketing of this drivel.  It looks to me that the overly positive reviews are from those that are a part of the sheep syndrome that is sweeping the nation.  Join the flock or be an outcast?  Sorry, I'm not so easily led...this is one lame movie.I feel so bad for Richard Harris.  One of his last roles and it had to be this weak character.  He's probably had worse rolls, but this certainly is not one to be proud of.  Big beards do not make a character wise or strong. Alan Rickman's character was by far the best played one. 
I'll rate this 1/10 because of the pretentiousness of the whole thing. Sorry kids, this one does suck.",1,13,32,23 November 2003
WALL·E," Not really very good.
","I really thought that this would be a very good animated movie considering the 8.6 star rating on IMDb when I watched it. I'm glad I got the DVD from the library and didn't see it at the theater or paid money to rent it.It was all quite boring. I don't know what people are raving about. I feel that people are giving it high ratings because they have been brainwashed into thinking that it's a great movie from reading all the other comments. Maybe people see some deep meaning or profound message in this movie, but I thought the whole thing was quite shallow. I'm trying not to include any comments that might be considered 'spoilers', but as far as I'm concerned, just watching spoiled it for me. How can you have one scene after another solely for the purpose of trying to make these characters seem cute and lovable and human? It was a real waste of my time watching this movie and I just don't feel like I want to join the rest of the flock of sheep on this one. Sorry, it's really not very good....at all.",3,5,16,31 January 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," This 'greatest movie/trilogy' will fade into oblivion in time..
","I think those that have described both this movie and the trilogy as the 'greatest ever' should go back to their video games.  In time, all three of these movies will take their rightful place in film history...oblivion. 
I can't understand how people can equate special effects with great film making.  There's really nothing positive that I can say about these movies except that the special effects were at first stunning.  Soon their repetitiveness led to utter boredom.I would much rather watch a film about realistic situations that people can actually relate to.  But I guess if you spent your entire life playing video games and watching other special effects based movies like these, then these movies would qualify as the greatest ever.Someone made the comment that this movie was better than Citizen Kane. Watch this movie as many times as Citizen Kane and see which holds up better.  Believe me, this whole trilogy will be a fading memory in ten or twenty years and Citizen Kane will continue to be praised.  This is just another case of the 'dumbing down' of the culture.  These same people probably can't wait until the next Superbowl so they can watch the commercials.I generously gave all three movies of this trilogy a 5/10.",5,26,63,28 May 2004
Gangs of New York," Not very good, fair at best.
","The movie made me think of 'Hook' with Dustin Hoffman.  The children had all grown up and no one was fooling around anymore.  This movie was a real fantasy.  I can't complain about the acting.  The actors all played their rolls quite well, especially the Bill the Butcher character.The story was just ridiculous.  The scenes were just too fantastic.  It just didn't resemble reality to me in any way at all. If this was supposed to depict American history, I don't think it was done very well.I think it was too big a production with too many hands in the mix.  It ended up a big mess.  I couldn't rate this more than 5 out of 10.  I'm surprised that the overall rating is as high as it is.",3,2,7,12 July 2003
Hacksaw Ridge," Could have been a great movie
","If it hadn't been for the typical overdone battle scenes, this could have been a great movie and a tribute to the man it was about. Anyone who has had any kind of military training can see that the battle scenes were totally over the top and unrealistic. There didn't seem to be any kind of battle strategy. There were so many weapons that never have to be reloaded, and when they fire them, they almost never miss the target. Even fully automatic weapons being sprayed wildly never seem to miss. Go to a shooting range and see how many there can shoot anywhere near that good, and those are the ones that go there on a regular basis. If you've never been, see if you can rent a gun. You'll be surprised at how difficult it really is. Granted, a rifle is much more accurate than a pistol, but in the high stress of battle, it's not going to be like shooting at targets. People that believe this kind of 'action' are the same ones that probably think that police can shoot the guns out of the bad guys hands. It's just impossible to shoot that rapidly with any kind of accuracy. This was a golden opportunity to make a really good movie about an important character in American history, but it missed the mark. Life is not a video game.",6,4,9,30 March 2017
The Island," Boring and pathetic
","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've seen and like most of the actors that are in this movie, but not in this movie. This is simply bad....really bad. Most of it is like watching a video game being played. Lots and lots of meaningless action. I couldn't wait for something to happen that would change my mind, but nothing ever did. I was just glad when it ended. Utterly boring, pathetic, and stupid.I'm glad I got a copy from the library and didn't have to pay any money to see this piece of work. I'm sure if you actually pay money to rent this movie, that you will probably want to kick yourself. The story line seems a little like something that was recycled from 'Logans's Run' but not nearly as original or good. Save yourself the agony of watching this poorly conceived story and get something else, anything else.",2,3,7,28 May 2006
