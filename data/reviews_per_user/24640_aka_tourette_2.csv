Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," painfully bad
","This is not Gore Verbiski's movie anymore, but I was very surprised to find out that the same writers of the previous parts wrote this pile of crap. To summarize, this is a collection of clichés, thin jokes and too clean pirates. Captain Jack is Captain Jack, but, yes, cleaner and much less inspired. Associating him with a forgotten love (Penelope Cruz), which is sassy and untamed, is a huge cliché. The plot, as a new adventure without any relation with previous stories but a map, is very poor crafted. The action sequences are just unreal, especially the escape from the court of King George. Everything feels artificial and crafted on commission. It's really an irony that this movie had the highest profits from the series. It shows that the public is really stupid or was unaware of how bad this is. Which is not an excuse, because I had the feeling this is going to be very bad from the first trailer I've saw( I watched the movie on HBO). Bad, bad, bad, worst corporate money making fast food type of a movie.",1,4,6,11 March 2012
Knives Out," well crafted propaganda
","You can't go to the movies anymore. Everything is just junk propaganda.In this one, the migrant inherits everything, because has a kind heart and from a higher stage is going to cast judgement upon the unworthy, wasteful.
