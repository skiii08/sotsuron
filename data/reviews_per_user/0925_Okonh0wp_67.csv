"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Once the race starts, things get exciting
","For his pedigree as a prestigious theatrical director, it's somewaht odd that David Schwimmer's directorial debut is an innocent popcorn comedy. Then again he's best known for a sitcom role, but it would have been nice to see Schwimmer try to escape that reputation.Nonetheless, 'Run Fatboy Run' is a perfectly watchable popcorn comedy about an aimless man in arrested development (Simon Pegg) who runs a marathon as a hail mary pass to win back his ersatz ex-wife/baby mama (Thandie Newton). The backstory (mercifully expositioned out of the way in the film's first three minutes) is that the protagonist left Newton's character at the altar on their wedding night out of fear. This sets up a rather obvious but serviceable character arc: The man's a loser because he's a commitment-phobe so finishing the race will represent his ability to commit.The film is set in London with a certain British whimsy in terms of many of the side characters including Harish Patel as a quirky yet sweet downstairs neighbor, Dylan Moran as the opportunistic best friend, and Nevan Finegan as a sexy no-nonsense landlady.The film can be firmly divided into two halves: Before Simon Pegg's character runs a marathon, and the marathon itself.In the first act, it's pretty typical with obvious foreshadowing and comedy that seems a little overly reliant on grotesque physical in a manner reminiscent of the 'Three Stooges' (or what I'd imagine the Three Stooges to be): In one scene, Pegg's character gets a nail in his toe in an effort to pop a blister; in another, he and Moran's character get into a fight that's played for humor based on the pain that the two are in. If you've seen the Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern be repeatedly bludgeoned in 'Home Alone' you'll get the picture.What really elevates the film is when he starts running the marathon and the subplots merge into more of a kinetic frenzy. The humor of bodily pain starts to segue into the tropes of a feel-good movie.This is one of the few wide-release running films and there's a lot of relatable stuff here in how annoying other runners can be, how some of the good running tips don't make sense until you're on the track, how will power will only take you so far without practice, and how running a long-distance race is often about the light at the end of the tunnel.",7,0,0,24 July 2018
Moneyball," Very Sorkinesque, Pretty Good
","Moneyball is all about Brad Pitt. Because the film ties Billy Beane's journey of self-discovery to that of his sport, and because there's a surprising amount of psychological depth to Beane himself, this film transcends the typical sports film. At the same time, it's a very exciting sports film in and of itself.The sad thing about professional sports today is that to spectators and players alike are excited by the whole phenomenon up until the point where they lose. This is a film that deals almost exclusively with how to deal with defeat and how victory itself is tenable. That says more about life than much of sports does today.This is Aaron Sorkin's third movie (Charlie Wilson's War and The Social Network) since making the abysmal television show 'Studio 60' and committed every sin imaginable in the TV writer's bible (don't have all the characters sound alike, don't use the show to air out your dirty laundry, try to at least pretend to care about where your story is set, etc.) and he's been using more and more restraint on those Sorkinisms. Occasionally, Sorkin still gets cringe-worthy as in the conversation between scouts about how they shouldn't put in a pitcher with an ugly girlfriend.Another weakness of Aaron Sorkin seems pretty subverted in Jonah Hill's shy and introverted character of Peter Brand. Unfortunately he drifts a little towards Sorkinish territory towards the end. On my top ten list (which I'm working to rapidly construct a couple weeks later than everyone else), this lands at #2. Not as profound as ambitious as 'The Tree of Life' but it's more intense and kinetic than anything else I've seen this year and it marries that intensity to a stronger story than a typical action or sports film",8,0,1,7 June 2013
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Subtle and warm
","*** out of **** stars:       Like the sport of golf, this movie is one of the less-adreniline felled and more slowed-down movies you'll ever see. Matt Damon plays a has-been in the world of golfing who was broken by his experiences fighting in World War I. Damon ultimately decides to get back into the sport of golfing with the inspiration of a little kid (played in his older days by Jack Lemmon, always a plus!), a unique caddy named Bagger Vance (Will Smith), and a tournament being thrown by his wealthy ex-lover (Charlize Theron) to help save her golfing club in depression-torn Savannah. Rather than adrelaine and lust for glory, Bagger Vance, somewhat of a centerpiece to which the film is built around, preaches love for the game and the inherent beauty of it. It's possible that the director intended to enfuse the film with some religious subtext, as Bagger Vance seems in some ways to be divine, we don't know where he came from or where he leaves for at the end of the film, and he seems to know exactly what to say at any given moment. Will Smith shows a little more range and depth that we're used to seeing from him, and the rest of the cast seems to have brought their A-game to the film. The drama, set against beautifully photographed backgrounds, is subtle and attentive, pleasantly mild.",8,0,1,31 March 2004
The New World," precise in its facts yet imaginative with its story
","As far-fetched as it sounds, The New World isn't too far off from another version of the same story: the Disney musical Pocohantas of exactly 10 years ago. It tells the story of John Smith and Pocohantas without the corny music numbers and of course it isn't animated but the romance is still there. John Smith and Pocohauntas were historical figures but they're also myths and some parts of their history are left to our imagination. Terrence Malick takes on the story with that sense of imagination while he grounds the visual look with a meticulous attention to historic detail. While it has some good action scenes, it's not an adventure epic in the mold of, say Indiana Jones, but one steeped in authenticity, more so, and actual real life probably went a little slower than you're used to seeing in movies, so be patient with it cause it is a very worthwhile and moving story.",10,1,4,28 January 2006
Catch Me If You Can," Hallelujah! Spielberg's back!
","In the crafty hands of Spielberg, a novel long having been considered as unintriguing, becomes an excellent piece of work. The autobiographical novel, written by Frank Abergnale, tells of a counterfeit-savvy teenager's three-year stint at eluding the FBI by posing as a pilot, doctor, and teacher in the 60s.            Abagnale's story, first published in 1980 was shopped around for weeks to studios before being picked up. After seeing this movie, I'm sure you'll have trouble thinking of it as unexciting. However, looking at it from a different angle, is a form of crime such as passing bad checks is nothing visually compelling and it doesn't lend itself well to base a whole movie about?            To this I credit Spielberg, who once again creates an exciting and fun movie, that families can get excited about seeing come holiday season. Spielberg, essentially, takes the stories and infuses it with a couple of familiar elements: a lost youth struggling with the abandonment of a father figure (or in this case, his actual father), as well as a cat-and-mouse chase. The former is something which we can relate to more than we consciously realize and the latter is something which adds suspense and fun to the story. The alienated youth theme has popped everywhere in Spielberg's movies, from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade to AI and everywhere in between. At the same time, I wouldn't call Spielberg's work, unoriginal or recycled, since he mixes these motifs in different combinations with other dramatic elements and the story itself is quite fresh.          Quality seeps out of every element in the film, from its score and sets to its dialogue and acting. I never thought I'd ever hear myself say this years ago, but Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a great performance, shedding aside his `Who needs acting when I'm a sex-symbol' attitude of old, and immersing himself in the role with all the vulnerability, despair, and aptitude it entails. Tom Hanks, of course, matches up to DeCaprio, line by line, as Hanratty, the FBI investigator who chases him for three years. The relationship of mutual respect between the two, and eventual lifelong friendship, is truly heartwarming. In Hanks' interpretation of the part, there is not just mutual respect but frustration bordering on obsession, as he borrows a page from the inspector in Les Miserables. Christopher Walken also has a big role as the father, with whom DiCaprio's character is very close.          The film is not only a joy in itself but a positive sign in this new century that the work of a skilled storyteller such as Steven Speilberg can still hold up after all these years.",10,2,4,23 June 2004
Deja Vu," Hampered by unoriginality and mismarketing
","The movie is hampered by unoriginality and bad marketing more than anything else. For anyone who's keeping count this is Denzel Washington's 4th role as a tough guy cop with everything on his hands in 3 years.To review them: In Out of Time, he plays a cop who is in love with someone who becomes a victim. In Man on Fire, he plays a jaded cop who sees his personal redemption as keeping a certain girl safe. In this film, he plays an Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Agent (I know, big change) who sees his redemption as saving a woman who's about to be murdered, who he's also slowly falling in love with. The recycling of plots and inability to find something new for Denzel Washington to do is the most appropriate use of the title Deja Vu, because it really doesn't have much to do with the plot.The film is actually more of a time travel movie, in which Denzel Washington and company are able to look through a window in time back 4 and a 1/2 days and try to travel back in order to prevent a massive explosion. Doesn't that sound much cooler? It is in fact much cooler but there was absolutely nothing about that in the plot description at the movie theater. My cousin, who i went to see it with, thought that that was because sci-fi movies don't sell. Personally, I thought it was because the perfect title for the film 'Out of Time' was already taken.One of the main gimmicks that makes the movie cool is the use of surveillance technology featured in the film, that also made the 1998 film 'Enemy of the State' so cool. And what do you know: The same director (Tony Scott) AND producer (Jerry Bruckenheimer) were the filmmakers of that project too. Deja vu all over again.",4,3,7,2 December 2006
In Bruges," Good Black comedy
","In Bruges is a black comedy whose idea arose from a vacation writer/director Martin McDonagh took to the pristine town of Bruges, Belgium. McDonagh reflected in the DVD featurette that he was in awe of the town's medieval beauty but had the simultaneous feeling of being incredibly bored after two or three hours. He took these two disparate feelings and split them up over two characters. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleason are a pair of hit men who are paid by their boss to go to Bruges for an undisclosed assignment. They are supposed to pose as two tourists and maintain a low profile while waiting for a phone call. Ken (Gleason) takes an interest in the sights of the town and jollily obliges, while Ray (Farrell) is very bored. He is somewhat of a cultural boob with low intellectual curiosity but he gets more likable as the film progresses as we slowly see that he starts to develop a curiosity about living a better life. He is also bored because he has just accidentally shot a boy and is coping with guilt over that. Ralph Feinnes also enters in the story a little later as the enigmatic boss. The film is also populated by the kinds of characters that come with small-town comedies: An obnoxious Canadian tourist, a pregnant innkeeper, an alluring coke dealer (who Ray falls in love with) and her unfortunate boyfriend, and an opinionated midget.The film reminds me of Analyze This or Anger Mangement in that it features a star (Robert De Niro or Jack Nicholson in the above examples) making fun of their screen personas. Colin Farrell is playing to type in an extreme sense, reflecting his public image: Shallow and mostly interested in booze and women. (In real life, Colin Farrell is an avid reader and student of history who would be the kind of guy who's interested in a place like Bruges, but I digress). It's an interesting mix of genres but as is the staple of this genre, the black comedy, there are usually meaningless deaths. I won't spoil what happens but I grew close enough to these characters that I came to hope that we wouldn't be seeing anything bad happen to them.The film also has an interesting and curious romance between Ray and the coke dealer. She seems to give him a lot of chances but it turns out that she has a dark side to her as well.The dialogue was really good and it was clearly an engaging film but a pet peeve of mine in the dialogue is that everyone talks the same and uses the f-word in every sentence. The screenwriter did such a great job of giving everyone distinct personalities so I wish they would give them distinct styles of speech.",10,3,7,11 January 2009
Erin Brockovich," A little more boring than I expected
","2 1/2 Stars (out of 4):      This film was greeted with a lot of acclaim and it was even nominated for an oscar, but I personally found it a little slow and boring. Julia Roberts' role as Erin Brockovitch, a poor but assertive single mom, earned her an oscar and I don't disagree that Roberts did a really good job. Based on a true story, Roberts plays the character with unusually dark notes in her crusade to win a lawsuit for a town who's suffered the side effects of pollution. However, Julia's frustration and anger at everyone else in the world for all her stress, got too repetitive for me. The element that kept the movie from not boring me out completely, aside from Erin Brockovitch's aggressiveness, was her relationship with eventual boss Ed (Albert Finney). Initially,  Ed is a lawyer who fails Brockovitch and enraged at being screwed over she forces him to give her a job there, so she can earn the money he owes. He reluctantly agrees, partly because of a thin layer of compassion under his inhumane lawyer mentality, and the working relationship between the two is very interesting and warm. In short, as a star vehicle for Julia Roberts to do something serious, yes, this works, but as a movie itself, only partially.",Null,0,1,9 May 2004
Mississippi Burning," 4 stars
","**** out of ****: I wouldn't  classify this as the definitive Civil Rights movie because it's more specific to this one case and doesn't really shed light on the whole picture of Southern racial abuse along with all its horrors. The most graphic part of the film is at the beginning, when a car driving down a barren road is pulled over by a couple of police officers. Rather then write a ticket for speeding they taunt them and shoot them. We don't really know exactly what happened, we have some idea that these officers are a little more than just consciencous of fast drivers, and that's what hooks us in. Two officers, Gene Hackman and William Dafoe, are sent into investigate, and once we know what they're investigating, there's the irony of the audience now knowing what's going on but the characters don't. Hackman and Dafoe have an interesting chemistry, I won't say good, because they start off in such distant alignments from each other, that there's no real partnering/interaction at first. Dafoe is a by-the-book guy who's young and inexperienced and Hackman is a somewhat more playful guy who's from the area and tries to act like he's 'one of the guys' when they interact with locals. There's an interesting power relationship between them, because despite Dafoe's inexperience and lack of street smarts, he's the senior officer on the case, but regardless of who really has more power between them, they don't really get anywhere  for a long time with this town. The drama is in a curious deadlock of the FBI officials saying, 'what happened to these missing people? where are the bodies?' and the locals in the town saying, 'we don't know, we didn't do anything? why don't you just go back and forget about the case?', and the two parties here start acting like my senile grandparents who ask the same question over and over thinking that they'll get a different response. This would get kind of boring, except for the changes happening within Hackman's character who starts to become more passionate about what's happening as he befriends the deputy's wife, Frances McDormand, and just gets more and more p***ed about stuff. Hackman really was at the heart of this movie and McDormand's character really added a lot to the movie, as a more innocent and foolishly youthful woman than the roles she normally gets. I wouldn't describe the film as jump-out-of-your-seat exciting, but the drama and quality is there underneath all the grittiness.",Null,1,2,8 May 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," not the best outing
","For the last year, box office analysts have been asking whether the popularity of movies was in decline, and America answered them with a resounding no by packing the movie houses in droves this past weekend and breaking a box office record. If only they had picked a better movie. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't as bad as a film could possibly be considering that it's the same great characters and setting as the original but it's close. The film brings back the old gang of characters but pairs them with and far more memorable and gruesome villain in Davy Jones. The octopus-like villain is played by Bill Nighy with a lot of help from CGI. The plot centers around everyone trying to find a chest with the heart of Davy Jones but I had very little idea why. To say that the film is confusing is an understatement. Put it this way: if Pirates of the Caribbean was a course, I would not pass the final exam, and even though the plot isn't necessary to enjoy the good-spirited swashbuckling fun, it certainly would have helped. When the movie isn't being dragged down by the plot, however, there are a couple of amazingly innovative action scenes that almost makes you want to forgive the confusion. One involves Johnny Depp, displaying a comic physicality that could rival Charlie Chaplain, running away from a tribe of cannibals. It is hard to understate how brilliant Depp is in these films and how much he brings to the series. The other involves a three-way swordfight and a waterwheel gone awry.",5,3,6,19 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," ***1/2 Stars
","Pirate lovers have been waiting for a movie like this since the days of `Waterworld' and `Cutthroat Island.' Set in Port Royal, an island historically associated with pirates, and based on a Disney world ride, the movie follows Orlando Bloom as a sword smith with a dark past, who enlists the help of famed pirate (Depp) to rescue the object of his affections (Knightly). To go in more detail would take hours because, unfortunately the plot's long-winded and has more twists and turns than one can keep up with in one sitting. Nevertheless, while Pirates veers into the basic formulas and clichés of any other pirate movie, it does so with purpose and style, to make a quality ride out of a familiar outing. The movie also has some truly original elements, most notably Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow, a name you'll remember long after you see this movie.",10,3,6,7 June 2004
Finding Nemo," 4 Stars!: Pixar strikes gold
","4 Stars: With a sense of imagination that only a child could have, Pixar has finally struck gold. En route to becoming the highest grossing animated movie in history, and deservedly so, Finding Nemo is a real gem for both kids and their parents. Its first move in the right direction is setting the picture underwater. Amid a previously unseen and pleasantly quirky world of spaced-out sea turtles and 12-step program sharks, the movie presents a heartwarming story about a father's search for his son. Add in witty dialogue and extroadinary performances by both Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks and you got a movie that's too good to miss.",10,3,5,31 May 2004
Troy," Every cliché in the book, but i liked it
","Troy opened up with some music, a little too heavily synthesized, building up tension between two humongous armies approaching each other. The suspense comes to a halt in an anticlimactic moment, as the all-powerful king cracks a joke. He then persuades his opponent to have their respective armies' best soldier fight each other rather than a more traditional all-out battle to spare bloodshed and gore. This is another anticlimax of sorts, we expected a big all-out fight and now we're not getting one, and now the squeamish people in the audience who don't like to see a bloody battle can feel relief. Within seconds, the next clever plot twist arrives, as we find our hero, Achilles, who we're looking forward to seeing because he's played by A-lister Brad Pitt, is actually missing from the battlefield because he had a wild night of passion and overslept, but he wakes up and goes out to the battlefield, where awaiting us are plot twists #4, that Brad Pitt is not as friendly as we thought he'd be, and #5, that the cocky guy twice his size is really no match for him.Within five minutes, every trick in the book has been used and while it's unoriginal, those gimmicks might have worked in other circumstances, but here, they felt like a half-desperate attempt to make sure that any and every mainstream viewer would be hooked onto this film. The original story of Troy, just wasn't gonna cut it, the producers probably thought. It's too long-winded, too complicated, these people regularly talk and interact with Gods, who would go for that? So the producers gave us a more Americanized version.When rallying his troops to war, Prince Hector cries, 'no men, we all love our families, we all love our country, and we all love our Gods', which sounds just like how the president would address soldiers today, making the audience think, 'oh, I was originally not sure if I'd like this boring Greek story, but these characters are so universal and I can relate to them,' but the truth is that those characters weren't relatable, because, yes they might have had some love for family or for country, but they're love for their Gods was much stronger and incredibly different than our love of Gods today. Not only did they believe in more than one God, but they weren't abstract beings from an unknown place in the sky, they regularly came down and interacted with the humans, they were recognizable detailed beings with different attributes and they didn't all like each other, not did they like all of the humans equally. In the Illiad, the gods Apollo and Athena are even rooting for the Trojans to win the war and actively help control the turn of events. In fact, Achilles is half-God himself, that's why he can run so fast. These parts of the story were vaguely referenced but ultimately left out to spare confusion.I really didn't get what the point was of digging up and adapting a Great work of Greek literature of they were going to strip it of it's Greekness. If I wanted to see great special effects, I could have gone to The Day After Tomorrow, but I chose to see this because of the cultural context of this story, where Gods were more numerous and warriors had a different place in society. This is definitely part of a trend that echoes our new global era in politics, where barriers between countries are being lowered and people around the world are discovering they have a lot in common. At the same time, though, our differences in cultures over history should be celebrated too, and it's a more worthless experience when the makers of this film chose to leave out those cultural quirks.I also think another force in play, which isn't the film's fault, necessarily, is how tightly all the big-budget films are released within one summer. Ten years ago, Forrest Gump opened in the summer of '94 and made 24,000 in its opening weekend, taking the #1 spot, dropped only 1.3% percent the next weekend, and was the #1 movie 6 weekends of that year. Troy, opened only 5 days before a highly anticipated Shrek, which made an eye-popping $125 million by weekend's end. Troy cost 175 million to make, so in order to make its money back it had to attract audiences attentions, and I think the filmmakers were under so much pressure to make that return that they made a safer picture with surefire widespread appeal, which deprived of us of what could have been a great movie.I don't know how this could be fixed, but it's a clear sign that the onslaught of new summer blockbuster after blockbuster, each one displacing the one before it as #1, is taking its toll on the quality of films.Sorry to drift into a tangent there, so back to the film. I still gave it 3 and a ½ stars, because once I accepted the Americanized road I was traveling on, I could enjoy the film's dramatic moments, the cinematography and, with the exception of Orlando Bloom, a first-rate ensemble. Homer wrote an incredible story, so it was hard not to be moved, and I have heard an argument that this Americanized version has encouraged viewers to read the book and culturally enhance themselves. I just think that the film, if it stuck to its roots, could have been better.",8,1,2,16 November 2008
Ed Wood," Burton's best film
","Ed Wood, however, is a brilliant idea for a biopic and it's a celebration of film making and a justification for it, even if the results are less than stellar. The subject of the film is a moderately eccentric man (played by Johnny Depp) who has attracted a cult following after his death by virtue of being considered the world's worst director. I know that's a hard title to place when you have guys like Michael Bay and Raja Gosnell still floating around along with countless film school graduates who have never even made it out of small-town film festivals. What separated Wood from the directors who spew out commercialized crap, however, was that Wood aspired to be Orson Welles and (in the film's portrayal of him, at least) he was so optimistic and upbeat about it that he thought he was well on his way to becoming him. That's what the film's about. It's that life isn't about success or failure but rather by creativity and how much you love what you do. Wood is portrayed as a winner because he dared to direct films and there's no better way to celebrate film-making than finding merit in the worst filmmaker.I think it was also interesting that with the exception of his first girlfriend, Wood had a creative team (i.e. Bill Murray's character, the wrestler) that followed him through all of his creative pursuits and acted as a quasi-support system. If this story weren't based on fact, I would be left to wonder why these people would keep working with him despite the fact that he failed so often and I think that's another way that the film highlights Wood's optimism. Perhaps, this is a parallel to Orson Welles' consistent use of the same people and his famous repertory company called 'The Mercury Players. Of course, Wood's relationship is closest to Boris Karloff, his idol as a kid, who he later befriended and had the privilege of directing him in film after film. The relationship between the two and the chemistry between Depp and Martin Landau is at the heart of the film. Landau, by the way, is stellar and very deserving of his award.As for the question of what separated Wood from the many people who never made it far past film school, there was surprisingly little. Wood's films were mostly independently produced and he was largely an unknown commodity when he died. He gained fame when his film 'Plan Nine from Outer Space' won a book-sponsored contest in 1981 of the worst films of all time. It's a film that was shown in the first week of my first film class and it's high number of inconsistencies and bloopers are very easy to spot. The movie answered questions for anyone whose watched this film about why it was made so haphazardly: Apparently, it was simply made as a way for Wood to appease his landlord and Burton's film has this great sense of dramatic irony as Jonny Depp's character says, 'I know this is the film I'll be remembered for,' but not in the way he wanted.",10,1,2,7 January 2009
Spider-Man 3," Uneven but an ultimately satisfying experience
","Spiderman 3 opened to mixed reviews but I wouldn't consider it a failure of a film. I personally thought it was a very uneven experience at first but satisfying overall. More importantly, it served as a satisfying conclusion to the series.The main problem, I think was that so much was resolved in Spiderman 2 (Harry knows who Spiderman is, Peter and Mary Jane get together, Peter confesses to Aunt May for lying about Uncle Ben's death, etc.) that there was little tension left over for Spiderman 3. That left the first hour of Spiderman 3 boring and uneventful. It started to feel like a teen flick and reminded me that without the superhero element, Spiderman does not have as much to offer in terms of rich and dynamic characters. In other words, I don't feel that Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry are interesting enough characters to base a film around if the superhero angle was taken out of the equation.Therefore, it was imperative for the film to not waste too much time with exposition and get into the superhero dynamics before the audience gets bored, which was the case with me. Once, the film found its groove, things started rolling, however. When Spiderman's suit turned from red to black (I'm sure there's some more technical term for what happened to him that some comic geek would know), you could really tell that Tobey MaGuire was having fun playing against type for the first time in his career. The new additions to the cast were all added in small doses, so as to not shadow the development of the three main characters: Topher Grace's sardonic humor complimented the tone of the series well (his humor sort of doubled that of the newspaper editor who provided much needed comic relief in the first two installments), Thomas Haden Church's character created opportunities for some great special effects work, and I have no major complaints about Bryce Dallas Howard.My final verdict of satisfaction came about ultimately because the ending really was very effective and it's hard to feel satisfied by any ending that you've waited five years and sat through a combined 7 hours of film to see.",9,0,0,13 June 2007
Knocked Up," Modern romance isn't pretty
","I think there's been a general notion recently that, at least among the mainstream demographic, the Romantic comedy is dead. So with that in mind, there's some good news and bad news. The good news is that the genre has been saved by a gifted young writer named Judd Apatow. The bad news: It isn't very pretty.It's sad but true. His film is crude and does very little to restore confidence to the institution of fatherhood. The PTA in this child's future school district is rightfully going to be frightened to death.At the same time, 'Knocked Up' probably comes closer to portraying modern romance more than any attempt at romantic comedy in recent years. As sad as it is to admit, romance these days is more about drunken hook-ups than it is about screwball-comedy-type courting and today's standard of chivalry might be a guy like Rogen's character, willing to commit to a girl he knocked up instead of Cary Grant.",7,1,1,29 December 2015
Blades of Glory," Has its moments but overall not a good comic work
","Blades of Glory stars John Heder and Will Ferrell as skaters who, due to zany circumstances beyond their control, are forced to skate together as the sport's first male-male pair. The comic premise here, as if it needs explaining, is that figure skating, at least in pairs' form, is all about sex. And no, it's not implicitly sexual, but you'll see when you watch this that the nature of the sport is that it just does not work when you stick two definitively heterosexual men into it. The results will make you cringe. But is it funny? Well, sort of.Another lesson the film reminded me of was that Will Ferrell, hilarious as he is, doesn't make a good movie by himself. You need to add in the right complements: preferably a screenwriter like Adam McKay and costars with improvisational ability like John C. Riley, David Koechner, Steve Carrell, and Vince Vaughn. When this happens, the actors get into a zone where jokes bounce off one another in a way that can't miss and they yield comic classics like 'Old School', 'Talladega Nights', and 'Anchorman.' This film has its moments but it never really gets into that zone. It has its quotable lines and flashes of brilliance that will make for a good trailer. The film features great performances by some great comic actors who with any luck will be able to use this as a springboard to bigger and better roles. These are Saturday Night Live's Amy Poehler and Will Arnett (formerly of Arrested Development) as a rival pair, as well as The Office's Jenna Fischer as their goody-two-shoes sister. But still, the film never creates that atmosphere where you're laughing so hard you can't focus on anything else. It doesn't have enough momentum to carry over from scene to scene. It might be because after Dodgeball and Talladega Nights, sports parodies are no longer a novelty. It might be because Ferrell might just be overusing the same macho comic persona a little too much. It might also be John Heder. I'm not sure whether I want him to succeed at something other than Napoleon Dynamite so that people can once and for all move past Napoleon Dynamite (which I thought was decent but nowhere near as deserving of all the praise it received), or if I just want people to just skip the middle step and forget Napoleon Dynamite AND John Heder, period. The point is that if you subscribe to my theory that Napoleon Dynamite was a complete fluke of film popularity as it relates to film quality, than Heder has a lot to prove in your eyes if he wants to share the screen with Ferrell. Whether he delivers is arguable. He does have some range and proves he can be people other than Napoleon Dynamite, but I don't think he meets the bar set by Will Ferrell's costars, at least in this particular movie.",5,2,4,2 April 2007
Horrible Bosses," Kind of rushed but pretty fun. Great chemistry
","That was one enticing trailer that 'Horrible Bosses' offered. Unfortunately, many of the best jokes were in the trailer. And it's worth pointing out that the trailer was misleading. It's not a film about three people trying to murder their bosses. That's really just the first act of the story. Maybe it's because the film switches directions in so many spots, that the film feels kind of rushed.The film is still pretty solid. Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, and Jason Bateman are three talented actors (Sudeikis and Day really prove themselves movie-worthy here) and the trio has Hangover-like levels of chemistry. Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell have a lot of fun hamming it up as villains. On the whole, I just wish it ran a little longer",8,1,2,7 June 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," A significantly different experience if you're not familiar with Queen
","Films that draw on historical subjects can produce an interesting divide in the viewer based on how familiar you are with the subject. A great deal of the 'Bohemian Rhapsody' reviews to date have expressed disappointment because it's a paint-by-numbers of all the major points of Mercury's life.As someone who grew up in a household where my father listened primarily to classical music and my mom listened to a radio station called 'The Sounds of Sinatra', I'm embarrassingly unfamiliar with most music before 1998. My knowledge on Queen boils down to A) songs I recognize by Queen like 'Bohemian Rhapdsody', 'Killer Queen', 'Somebody to Love', and 'We Will Rock You' and B) songs that play on commercials or in summer festivals or movie soundtracks that I knew of but didn't know they were specifically Queen like 'Under Pressure', 'Another one Beats the Dust', and 'We are the Champions' (thanks 'The Mighty Ducks' for the assist on that one) and little information on the band members. I honestly have no idea how people can keep track of the names of so many band members of groups that came before their time. The point, however, is that your knowledge of Queen is going to affect how you see this film.If you follow the school of film criticism that the film's intent matters, I'd suggest that this film was made for people like me. Reading the interviews with Queen's surviving band members, director Bryan Singer and producer Graham King, this was a passion project because they wanted to educate. Look at Graham King's quote:'But I was also fascinated with the idea that there is so much about Freddie Mercury and Queen-arguably one of the greatest bands in history-that the general public does not know....This is such an important story to tell, and, for me, it was crucial that we not only celebrate their music and achievements, but also give people a better understanding of the band's history.'At the same time, if you're not going to see the film specifically to rediscover Freddy Mercury from a backstage perspective, this will read kind of like every other rock biography in existence. The protagonist is a man driven by pure id and does whatever he pleases and, for the most part, doesn't care who's in his way. It's the result of having all the right creative instincts and being isolated from reality by handlers who want to feed off of him. The protagonist's ego becomes oversized and he sews his wild oats. He either gains self-control or doesn't (they often dies young) but the audience is encouraged to see his beautiful soul and his contributions over his sins because that audience is biased before the movie stars by an appreciation for the music.
It's not really the fault of the film if it all follows a predictable script: The screenwriter is beholden to the details of the subject's life and Freddy Mercury is what they had to go with.Some of these entries (Love and Mercy is a good example) manage to transcend the genre even with figures who fall into the same narrative but Bohemian Rhapsody is largely beholden to the genre. As interesting as Mercury was of a person, the story flattens some of the more interesting chapters of his life by not involving his origin as a Parsi immigrant (his family is largely absent beside the opening chapter) or a promising student. His conflict with his surname and legacy and status as an immigrant is never explored.Similarly, there was a harmony among the members of the group that is overlooked in the film because conflict is juicier. To what degree were they ok with his gay lifestyle? There are erroneous complaints that the film straight-washes Mercury (not true), but it would be interesting if his band mate's reaction was covered. Similarly, the band was held together because 'they were a family' but I was told that more than I was showed it.Part of the problem is screen time: With his marriage to a woman that fell apart because she was upset with him for being bisexual (it seems that there is a misunderstanding over whether bisexual means faithful), his bandmates, his family, his lecherous manager, his exploration of himself some of these chapters get short shrift.On the whole, it's certainly watchable but it had more unanswered questions than room to fill.",7,3,5,4 November 2018
Burn After Reading," Surprisingly good for a Coen film
","I have now seen 8 Coen films to date and would not profess myself a major Coen fan. I was baffled by No Country for Old Men, I fell in love with Oh Brother Where Art Thou, I watched the cult status behind Big Lebowski and Fargo grow from the sidelines, I enjoyed Intolerable Cruelty, and I lost my faith in the brothers with Ladykillers and Man Who Wasn't There.As you can see, it's an up and down relationship that I've had with their films, and was hesitant to log in an 8th Coen outing (I feel 7 is more than enough films to see of a director you're not crazy about) but couldn't resist the bizarre-sounding plot and the idea of seeing Brad Pitt go into full comic mode. And I thoroughly loved the film.For one thing, I'm a native of D.C. and the Coens have a great sense of place in their films: the superficiality of sunny Hollywood in Intolerable Cruelty, the bible-belt-based bluegrass-churning populist Southern Charm in Oh Brother Where Art Thou, and the quirkiness of the Minnesota cold in Fargo. I can't tell you how great the reception was in D.C. where we might not see these things as that far-fetched: beauracrats (in the form of JK Simmons) making decisions about what to do when people are getting killed and secrets are being spilt out to other nations on the basis of what takes the least paperwork and allocating $50,000 for a random lady's plastic surgery for virtually no reason at all.The plot is truly screwball and does a far better job of past Coen films at raising the ante in the third act so that we're invested to see what deliciously improbable ways the screenwriters will tie up the loose ends. It also doesn't help that some of the protagonists are actually likable: Brad Pitt as the airhead exercise junkie who's as faithful a friend as they come, Frances McDormand as the gym worker who just wants to look pretty, Richard Jenkins as the poor schlub who likes her, etc.",9,3,8,14 September 2008
The Bourne Identity," Fair but with Matt Damon, it had potential to be really good
","The Bourne Identity is Matt Damon's most meaningless role ever. Although Damon's character Jason Bourne is a great spy-type figure in terms of his ability to survive an onslaught of guys who want to kill him, I really just had zero interest in the character itself. I know other guys will respond with, `Well, who cares about character development, that's not the point. It's just supposed to be a fun action movie', but I've seen Matt Damon take roles that weren't supposed to be complex and turn a decent movie into a good one by doing something with the character. If you've seen Talented Mr. Ripley, for example, you might be disappointed with Damon's role here.             There are a couple pluses to the film, as I mentioned earlier. There are some action sequences here that would make James Bond jealous and a car chase that could rival the French Connection. There's also a love story going on which is nicely low-key staying in the background. I'd even say this could have been a really good action movie, if only the action star would have lived up to his potential.",Null,0,1,9 June 2004
Trouble with the Curve," Somewhat problematic
","An aging scout who looks like Clint Eastwood (who in real life, by the way, is over 80) is being pushed out of his job (hello, it's called retirement) and adopts an attitude of spunky rebelliousness, when in fact he can't do the job anyways because he's losing his vision. A movie premise based on a plot hole a mile wide is on some shaky ground to begin with. It doesn't help matters that every person who disagrees with him about retirement conveniently turns out to be an incompetent a-hole.The film still has some nice moments and takes us moderately deeply into the universe of baseball scouting and going somewhere new is always interesting. At the same time, a more realistic film might have made us feel like we were actually experiencing the life of a baseball scout.The film's other strong points are Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake. As someone who is not in the camp that Timberlake has previously displayed any acting skills, this is Timberlake's first role in which he could legitimately be called an actor. Amy Adams, who is always wonderful, showed here that she can actually be sexy on screen on top of all the other great character beats she bought with the character.",6,0,2,15 May 2013
Cold Mountain," probably best movie of the year
","An extroadinary epic, that is more of an `odyssey'/'oh brother where art thou' type of picture, than a civil war picture. Jude Law, in a performance that exceeded my expectations of what I thought was possible of him, plays a confederate soldier who deserts and heads home to Cold Mountian, North Carolina at the request of a girl (Kidman) with whom he shared just a single kiss before leaving. The people that Inman (Law) encounter along his trek, shed light onto the cruelty of man when times get tough and the fragility of life. As the film switches back and forth between Imman, and the difficulty back home on the farm for Kidman and her helping hand Ruby, played memorably by Rene Zellwenger, you're taken on an gut-wrenching ride that will have both very bright and dark parts. The score, which combines elements of bluegrass and stirring classical, is exceptional as well.",Null,0,0,15 January 2004
Little Miss Sunshine," You'll laugh, cry, and jump for joy
","This might be one of the few movies in which the phrase 'you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll jump for joy' is a true statement, because at the very least, I know I did all three of those things over the course of the movie.Little Miss Sunshine centers on a dysfunctional family and their misguided hopes to redeem their problems through the potential success of their youngest member Olive (Abigail Breslin). Olive has won a spot in a California beauty pageant and with brother Dwayne (Paul Dano), her uncle (Carrell), her grandfather (Alan Arkin), and her parents (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collete from The Sixth Sense), goes on a road trip to the pageant from her Albuquerque, New Mexico home. Within an all-star cast, Steve Carrell and Greg Kinnear prove themselves versatile character actors and Alan Arkin's comic shtick compliments their turns nicely as adults who have taken different paths to failure. Carrell's uncle Frank is an accomplished scholar who has just attempted suicide because his boyfriend has left him and he's been fired. Kinnear plays Richard, a self-help motivational speaker who could desperately use a dose of his own medicine while Arkin is the perfect antidote to Richard as his dad who isn't so much unhappy as he is careless with regards to his life. Toni Collette as the family matriarch is the glue that holds all of them together with her level-headed attempts to cope with one problem at a time, but even she is starting to have her problems as she resorts to smoking again. The family's dysfunction is already starting to rub off on older son Dwayne, who has taken a vow of silence and proclaims he hates everyone, so there is a certain desperation within the family that unspoiled at the age of 8, Olive might be the only one left in the family who has a chance at normalcy.Little Miss Sunshine comes to movie screens nationwide from the Sundance film festival where the filmmakers benefited from being able to have the creative freedom to find their own voice. In this case, it allowed Michael Arndt to write a particularly poignant script that was able to fearlessly go to dark places in finding its moments of joy. The film's R rating, therefore is not just because of the number of bad words, but because the film goes to incredibly dark places touching on failed dreams, suicide, coping with death, a son cussing out his mother for being a failure. Every bit of it is necessary because without hitting such lows, the film's uplifting moments become all the more sweeter. Little Miss Sunshine is a richly told story that brings about a feeling that few movies can offer.",10,4,8,29 August 2006
Bad Teacher," A great Cameron Diaz vehicle
","The comic set-up of a slacker in an important profession is getting some legs lately with Bad Teacher, Bad Judge, Bad Santa, and Brooklyn Nine Nine (which is essentially 'Bad Cop') and why shouldn't it? TV, film and real-life are all inundated with people who take their jobs too seriously, so this is a refreshing charms. The film comes in a phase in Cameron Diaz's career where she was no longer America's hot it girl (her 'advanced' age is even referenced in Diaz's other 2011 film 'The Green Hornet) and could have fun indulging in her comic persona which generally has a bit of a bite to it. The film can be read as a commentary on Diaz actively rebelling the shorter expiration date for hot film actresses by trying in vain to raise the money for a boob job and attempting to con real life ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake (who likely will not run out of roles 20 years from now) into marrying him. Back when Diaz was known for her supermodel looks and screen presence, her comic gifts were taken for granted which is why this has been such an interesting phase in her career.As for the film itself, while the premise is risqué, the film is in the mold of a classic comedy. It uses the medium well (something movies have to do more and more in this age of TV comedy) by filling up its two hours with nicely outstretched character arcs and big scenes (i.e. the car wash, the field trip). Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins and the endearing Jason Segel shine strong in supporting parts as well.",8,5,8,18 November 2014
Quantum of Solace," Bond bleeds, how terrific
","Q's parting advice to James Bond before setting off for his retirement in 'The World is Not Enough' was 1) to always have an escape plan and 2) never let them see you bleed.It appears James Bond didn't take this advice and it has worked out for the better. Bond appeared to have wrapped up the entire series with Die Another Day's array of homages and outlandish gadgets, and most importantly, the end of Bond's contract.But in a decade where sequels are money, Bond didn't adhere to exiting at what would have been an opportune moment. Like Batman Begins and Superman Returns, the dapper British agent got a remake. While I tend to see this later trend of reinventing franchises as a commercial ploy more than anything else, there's been a distinct change in Bond that I've come to enjoy: Mainly, the Daniel Craig incarnation of Bond is one who bleeds.Pierce Brosnam would rip through armies of henchmen, without even messing up his hair or spotless tuxedo and frankly it was getting a little old.The new James Bond series injects something that makes the series consequential: risk. Bond is capable of getting hurt, he feels remorse, he's capable of learning, and he's got room for improvement.I have watched every James Bond films and I enjoy them as I do a film genre where I can see how every film deals with each of the checkpoints: Beautiful scenery, sexy girls, elaborate lairs, megalomaniac villains, and cool-looking gadgets. I do wish Quantum of Solace had more gadgets and the villain was a little more distinctive, but I have gotten a little tired of seeing Bond bed every woman and shoot every villain just because it was some protocol for the scriptwriters to follow and it was great to see the screenwriters actually approach these issues. Furthermore, it has started to get a little jarring to see what has happened in the news with Guantanamo Bay and the Blackwater scandal to still have one of our iconic heroes on screen taking lives first and asking questions later.So that's what Quantum of Solace bought to the table, even further expanding on the direction that Casino Royale was taking the franchise. The action occupied, perhaps, a little too much time on the screen, but it was excellently choreographed. The Bond girls were striking and exotic, Jeffery Wright nailed his role as Felix and Mattheiu Almahric does what he can with a limited role. The film also takes us to some beautiful locations: Haiti, Italy, and Bolivia. Most importantly, however, Daniel Craig gives us a Bond who feels like a real person, flesh and blood, and that is a massive improvement.",9,2,6,16 November 2008
Batman Begins," Not the same Batman, i know that much
","Whatever you think of Batman Begins, you kind of have to give more credit to X-Men and Spiderman for getting it right the first time. The execs at Warner Brothers have changed their minds over what they want to do with this superhero franchise of theirs that they go and retool it every two movies. So it's kind of disorienting watching this one, in ways good and bad. For one, I feel a little disappointed in the batmobile: it's more like a bat tank. Mainly, though, the story's a lot more complicated with its humongous cast of characters. If I didn't know any better, I'd guess there's a rule that anyone who's ever been nominated for an Oscar gets a coupon for a free role in a Batman movie that everyone's cashing in on (if you want to know the exact stats, which I hope you do because I spent 10 minutes researching this, 5 actors in this movie have earned 12 Oscar nominations between them), and they had to try extra hard to find parts for everyone., which led to some characters who just didn't need to be there. Like Morgan Freeman, for example, is a scientist who designs Batman's gadgets. I love Morgan Freeman but what exactly is he doing there? Doesn't Q belong with James Bond? Also, who's the real villain? Aside from making the story confusing, I think part of the fun of Batman is that you have this whacked hero dressed up as a bat and then you have even wackier villains with themes of their own, like a guy who dresses like a Penguin or the Riddler. With the exception of the Scarecrow, this movie doesn't really have that here. Unfortunately, I didn't really see the scarecrow that much, anyway. I think the reason for adding someone like crime boss Carmone Falcone was to show us how bad of a place Gotham is. Now Tim Burton didn't ever need to resort to that. He created such a dark tone that he could show us what Gotham was just by showing us a frame of it. I will add, though, that most people who see this movie will probably agree that Commissioner Gordon and Alfred are both two really strong characters in this movie and they add a lot, unlike the other movies where they kind of stand around and look like idiots next to Batman. So, as I say, the story's different but as it stands on its own, it really works well. It had the same piecing-together-of-the-puzzle element that the Star Wars III prequels had, which is real cool. If you've watched any Batman TV episode or watched any Batman movie, then you can't help but be intrigued by a movie that answers the questions, where did Batman get the idea for Batman, how did he get the batmobile or the batcave, where did he learn to fight?, etc.",7,1,2,23 July 2005
Liar Liar," Carrey's first good movie to date
","The film starts with Carrey, a divorced father, having to cancel on his son's birthday party because his boss suddenly wants to have sex with him and for the sake of his job, he can't refuse. His son then makes a wish that his father won't lie for a day, and unfortunately for the dad, who's trying to win a case in court for a client who's clearly guilty. As you can see, it's a very funny setup and the movie delivers constant laughs, thanks to Carrey's 110% efforts in the physical comedy department. Throughout most of the movie, Carrey's character doesn't want to have to tell the truth so the a highly visible battle between the side of him that doesn't want to tell the truth and the spell cast on the other side of him which, provides Carrey with the perfect arena he's been looking for to showcase his high-energy antics since his sophomoric days of Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber. What's more, there's also some sentimental value to the story.",7,0,0,22 May 2004
The Man Who Would Be King," 4 Stars: an excellent period piece
","Michael Caine and Sean Connery star in this excellent period piece set at the dawn of Post-Colonial India as the British soldiers are pulling out. The glimpse it provides into this time period feels fine-tuned in its authenticity and the cinametography is excellent. Caine and Connery star as Peachy and Danny, two soldiers who are enjoying imperialism too much to leave it. One asked by a fellow Brit why they haven't gone home, Peachy responds 'Home to what? A porters uniform outside a restaurant and six penny tips from belching civilians for closing cab doors on their blowzy women?'
     The two good friends decide that just for the hell of it, they'll conquer Kazakhstan, a remote kingdom on the other side of the Himalayans. Danny and Peachy are two brilliant creations, obviously because of what the actors bring to them, but also because they are the perfect embodiment for Eurocentric foolishness. They are guided by the modern-day equivalent of the Spanish Conquistadores' 3 Gs: gold, god, and glory.      So the ambitious pair trek across the mountains heavily confident that even though they'll be heavily outnumbered, they'll be able to unite everyone and be kings. The two find themselves overconfident and underqualified when they arrive, but for a short while, very lucky. After an arrow shot into Danny's (Connery) heart gets stopped by his armor, the primitive tribes start seeing him as a God, and things become very interesting for the pair.      Because most of the film is presented as a flashback, we know from the beginning of the film that at some point things went awry, because only one of the friends made it back alive. I won't tell you exactly what went wrong, but it has a little to do with their Euro-Imperialistic mindset I mentioned earlier. However, at the end of the film I was glad that one of the two friends made it back so that we could've heard such a beautiful story about friendship, ambition and ultimately, greed.",10,4,10,29 May 2004
Gran Torino," A sweeping look at ageism, cultural clash, shell shock, and more
","Gran Torino, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, might very well be the best film I've seen all year (either that or Slumdog Millionaire). It was truly an amazing and profoundly moving experience. The story is about a grumpy, foul-mouthed, and somewhat bigoted old Korean War vet in a rundown neighborhood who is at first resistant to the change he sees his community taken over by the Hmoung (ethnic group from Southeast Asia). In most films, the cinematography is designed to glamorize what's in front of the camera, but Clint's (or should I say Walt, his character's) neighborhood is starkly unpleasant to look at. It's one of those rundown industrial towns that has seen its glory days pass it by, just like Walt.The neighbors are threatened by gang violence and when Walt saves them from being harassed by pointing a gun at the gang, he becomes a reluctant hero. Not wanting any special attention, he refuses all the gifts, but he gradually softens up as his neighbors keep tugging away at his heartstrings and starts to mentor the two kids next door, Sue and Tao. The film is a sweeping look at faith (Clint's conversations with a priest are one of the high points of the film and serve as a thematic counterpoint to the action), shell shock, urban decay, culture clash, and especially ageism.Clint does battle and proves his worth to teenagers who are essentially writing him off because he's old. Maybe that's what every teenager does these days. This is the first picture I've seen to confront ageism so well. The film features Clint Eastwood's best performance.",10,1,5,16 January 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," While it feels like a 2nd tier movie, it's still a pretty fun action flick
","If the critics had their way, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer would never have been made. They pretty much unanimously bashed the first Fantastic Four film, yet the film went onto a very respectable 56 million dollars opening weekend en route to a 154 million dollars overall.I haven't yet seen the first film but if it's anything like the sequel, it isn't too hard to see why critics might feel like this franchise is a second-tier version of X-Men or Spiderman. The special effects can be pretty impressive at times. The London Eye sequence, for example, and the airborne battles are great set pieces. If I hadn't been introduced to Google Earth in the last couple of years, I would have been blown away by the scene where the Human Torch first chases after the Silver Surfer where the frame zooms out of Manhattan to a satellite photo of the Eastern seaboard as a flaming red speck and a silver fly across it. The problem, however, is that the special effects and the world they're set in do not seem well thought-out. Having the Human Torch and Silver Surfer bounce around from New York to Washington D.C. to outer space and Cairo without much second thought, almost feels like something out of a ripe-for-parody 1950's B movie.That's the case for a lot of this movie: a villain with the name Dr. Von Doom (could they have been any less subtle?), this general blasé feeling by every character in the film about the world ending, etc. Take a film like 'Independence Day' to see a somewhat more grandiose vision of our world as it faces a doomsday scenario. In 'The Fantastic Four,' Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) massages her husband's shoulders as he's being a work-a-haulic and says, 'Relax, it's not like the whole weight of the world is on you.' Actually, that's kind of EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. Batman is a superhero franchise that's set in 'Gotham' and with it, this dark otherworldly atmosphere and Superman weaves together the world of the mundane in Manhattan with extraordinary abilities of Spiderman and his villainous counterparts. On the contrary, Fantastic Four, just appears set in Manhattan out of a lack of anywhere better to film it in. In short, Fantastic Four doesn't feel like a fully realized superhero film in tone.What makes up for it, in part, is a certain kind of camaraderie between the characters. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chilkis) both are characters imbued with a sense of humor and form a sort of Abbott and Costello chemistry. Besides just being eye candy, Sue (Jessica Alba) brings a sort of feminine balance to the group. Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) is the actual superhero of the group: the equivalent of Peter Parker in Spiderman or Wolverine in the X-Men series. Much of the drama centers around the choices he makes. When you see these four in interviews or press conferences, there's a chemistry between them all that makes them that much more appealing on screen.So overall, it's a decent action flick that pulls in some decent laughs but it's not necessarily a must-see event.",6,5,10,17 June 2007
Transformers," The event picture of the summer: ET meets Independence Day
","Word to the wise: If a film makes $300 million without being a sequel, chances are it's probably a good film.I wish I adhered to this lesson sooner because I ended up stumbling upon this movie inadvertently (I was waiting for another movie to start and wandered into the Transformers theater) and I was fortunate to discover THE event picture of the summer even if it was eight weeks past its release and there was no one left who hadn't seen it that I could proclaim it's greatness to.Produced by Stephen Spielberg and directed by Michael Bay, I'm happy to report that between the clash of these two creative visionaries (or should I say one creative visionary and a guy whose primary interest as a movie director is making things explode), that the end result is a movie that's far more Spielberg than it is Bay. Transformers plays out along the lines of Spielberg's 'Things are best seen from a children's point of view' theme that is most closely associated with E.T. Along the lines of this E.T. analogy, massive credit goes to the casting department for using Shia LeBouf in the 'Drew Barrymore' role, because he is largely the reason the film works so well. Charismatic, a little vulnerable, and witty, Shia LeBouf balances the heavy mythology with lighthearted fun reminiscent of Han Solo's role in Star Wars. I think it's also a good bet that like Harrison Ford, Shia LeBouf will enjoy a rich and long-lived career.While coming off as the second coming of E.T., the film also has a touch of Roland Emmerich films like The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day where the impossible task of trying to portray an entire planet as it deals with a global attack is portrayed through a cross-section of people whose story lines weave closer together as the plot progresses and there were plenty of interesting characters from Jon Voight's airhead Secretary of defense (a little reminiscent of Rumsfeld but a slightly better listener) to Jon Turturro as a special agent to Rachel Taylor as a sexy intelligent computer programmer to Megan Fox as a very compelling girl-next-door type who commands the protagonist's interest.Of course, with Michael Bay as the director, the action gets a little excessive (especially in the final battle scene), but ultimately, the film is all about character and that's what makes it memorable",3,0,2,28 August 2007
Quiz Show," 4 Stars!
","Quiz Show is a really thought-provoking and engaging period piece about a TV show scandal from the 50s. Rob Morrow plays Dick Godwin, an investigator for a congressional subcommittee, that reads an article in the paper that grabs his attention about a closed-door judicial hearing about a show he enjoys watching. Looking for a good challenge, Godwin decides to investigate the case and see if he can take the famous quiz show '21' down.Morrow is aided by a show's former contestant Herbie Stemple, played by John Turturo, a blue-collar Jew trying to make ends meet and is enraged, both by the fact that his 15 minutes of fame are up, and also by the fact that the producers of the show made him take a 'dive' when his ratings were up. Godwin is eager to go along with Stemple until the ex-contestant claims that the show's current reigning champion, Ivy League college professor Charles Van Doren is cheating. Morrow, a Harvard graduate himself, has befriended Van Doren in his investigation and starts to ask himself what's really going on? The beauty of the movie is that we're asking ourselves that question as well too, as the script cleverly keeps some of the secrets from us until a little later in the movie.
The movie's moral frame interestingly rests on Morrow's character Godwin, who clearly has a better sense of right and wrong than anyone else in the movie, yet isn't quite sure what to do with them. When someone asks him, `If someone offered you thousands of dollars to appear on TV and cheat on some questions, and no one would ever know, would you do it?' Godwin unflinchingly says he wouldn't without a second of hesitation. The movie's suspense comes from Godwin's search for clues, but there's an anticlimax here because he solves the puzzle but when it's all over, he finds himself looking back and wondering if his efforts really changed anything within the system. Herbie Stemple has a similar anticlimactic moment as well.
This film is one of my favorites just because of the overall attention to detail. A lot of the suspense and drama is cleverly drawn out and the sets have an authentic 50s feel. More than anything else, I think the characters are really just engaging and that just helps keep us gripped on the drama. For example, Charles Van Doren seemed to me a creation that goes against so many Hollywood stereotypes. Most good looking guys in movies have girls with them, but Charles Van Doren never really had a love interest in this movie, except for a couple fractions of scenes where he's taking out a girl, most of the time he talks about how too many girls crowd around him. He also seems to like and admire his dad more than most adult sons do, at least as seen on screen. Those characteristics of Charles Van Doren struck out at me, especially because of his eagerness to befriend Godwin more than he really need to if he was doing it entirely for ulterior motives.",10,1,1,30 April 2004
Everest," Wonderful, slightly jarring film, true to history
","Everest is definitely a unique viewing experience. On the level of visual spectacle, the film is unmatched. The backdrop of Everest is captured with the majesty and visual intricacy of what you might expect in an IMAX movie but it does service at all this gorgeous scenery because there are people in front of that scenery who you're invested in.The film is based on a true story. May 10th, 1996 was arguably the most disastrous day in Everest's history in terms of cost of human life and the film morphs from an adventure film into a tragedy in the film's final third (similar to 'Titanic' although I'm sure fewer people are aware of how this film ends). The film juxtaposes joy and tragedy in a relatively jarring way that could be described as muddled.The first part of the film is undoubtedly a celebration: Both of the camaraderie between a group of adventures from different walks of life, as well as the fulfillment these people get in conquering nature.But in the film's final hour, the story becomes an allegory for how nature has a way of getting the last laugh when you least expect it. Like other natural disasters, there's little thematic rhyme or reason here (and one can't fault the film for being true to the story).The film is jarring in that way, but it feels oddly complete and profound as well.The density of the story lines can make the story hard to follow but the film does justice to the all the people involved in the story by denying us any composites or omissions. As a result, the film boasts a large part and big name talent (rising star Jason Clarke takes the lead with Oscar-nominees Josh Brolin, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emily Watson, Keira Knightly and John Hawkes all in the mix) lending their talents to many of the parts.Ironically, character actor Michael Kelly plays the journalist who would eventually author the definitive account of the incident and he's given surprisingly little service here. I'd almost read this as a misdirect of sorts.features a large ensemble and does",10,1,2,1 October 2015
Chariots of Fire," More than just a song
","Most people are familiar with the Vangelis' theme to this movie, but they don't know much about the film itself, and it's a shame that the film itself hasn't received enough recognition.        Today, when the defining climax comes in a sports movie, they can conviniently rely on slow-motion to create drama. If you've ever taped a basketball game or a baseball game, it's fun to take just that game winning shot or game-winning homerun and watch it frame-by-frame to be able to disect exactly how that batter was able to do that, and movies of the 90s (Angels in the Outfield, Iron Will, the Rookie, etc, i could name about 20 others) have picked up on that. But Chariots of Fire was able to create a lot of that drama without any slow motion or much of the technology that we have today. Instead, I think those races in the end are so captivating because the characters themselves engage us.     The story takes place in 1920s Britain, and yes, it is true, people back then were able to run pretty fast, even though they wore funny-looking shoes. The two main characters are both sprinters with different motivation. The first, Harold Abrahams, is a promising young student at Oxford with a chip on his shoulder, he's Jewish and feels like an outsider. One of the things the film does really well is get that paradox across to us, we see the guy fit in really well, he gets girls, he gets to act in the school play and sing corny Brittish songs, and of course since he's so fast, he obviously has the respect of the other runners, but on the other hand, there's that slight difference between him and everyone else. It's partially a self-fulfilling prophecy, him feeling like an outsider makes him an outsider, but also some of the finer details of the film reinforce the point, the shots of the university, itself, look so gothic and non-Jewish. Either way, that subtleness really is part of how the film is so delicately made and able to give a grasp of the guy's kind of inner motivation.
      At the same time, the movie follows a parallel plot of another sprinter Eric Lidell, who's dashing good looks and speeed win him many fans, but he's not really into that, he's a missionary and very devoted to God, but he loves running too, and as he tells one of the other sisters he works with, he feels that his two passions complement each other, and that he thinks that when he's running, he feels God's strength and he can also use his fame to talk about how great God is, so he follows through on that.      The movie tells two captivating stories, with a great historic-period feel, but it is kind of interesting how the character's two paths never really collide, but rather seem to kind of coexist on the screen, harmoniously. Considering the two run the same event, and with the clashing ways in which religion motivates the two, you'd think that would set the stage for conflict, but oddly, it doesn't happen like that. The two first meet, and have a tense and contrived 'good luck to you' exchange before the race in which one loses (I won't say which one), and when they get to the Olympics, Eric refuses to run the 100 because it takes place on the Sabbath, even though he's been training for that for months. While, there's some dissapointment that these two aren't gonna battle it out as predicted, that moment in the movie says a lot about the character, and I think by making the movie more about their inner journeys within themselves rather than verse each other, the movie boldly defies the predictable route.",Null,2,3,24 April 2004
The Last Samurai," very underrated movie, go watch
","Being released alongside so many other great war epics, The Last Samurai probably won't get the recognition it deserves, but that should not detract from its achievements. Set in 1870s Japan, this is an epic set around a washed-up Civil War veteran played by Tom Cruise. Whether you think he's too much of a pretty-boy or not, Cruise can still create magic on screen, even if he plays the same kind of guy over and over. To refresh your memory, Cruise starts his films (Rain Man, Jerry MaGuire, etc) as an arrogant jerk before meeting an inspirational figure, that leads him to a journey of self-discovery where he changes himself and turns into a true hero. This movie is the same, but within the context of a war epic, Cruise is just what the doctor ordered, and just as Hoffman and Cuba Gooding Jr did exemplary work alongside him, Cruise's brings out the best in costar Ken Wattanbe, who had an extroadinary presence, in an already emotionally stirring relationship. The story is beautifully told and visually beautifully portrayed.",Null,1,2,15 January 2004
Woman in Gold," A great film that fell through the cracks
","My original perception was that this was an indie flick that only played in the art houses because it was an artsy film. the truth is that it's a great film that simply didn't get the luck of the draw when it came with mass distribution. Woman in Gold would be at home with any of the Oscar nominees and contenders and would easily be considered more of an outright crowd pleaser than a film like Danish Girl (which got nominated in acting categories) or Brooklyn (which did make the final cut for Oscar). The film is based on an eight-year-long quest by a California-based lawyer of Austrian descent and a longtime family friend from the motherland (the prior relationship between the characters is erased in the adaptation process) to reclaim confiscated art by the Nazis. The film's main strength is that it's neither a holocaust story nor is it a standard courtroom drama, but it's a fresh new take on both genres. As for the former, the film feels fresh through its specificity to the Austrian experience and the specificity of a wealthy family. The film is more relatable to the experience of anyone descended of an immigrant who had to leave the old regime. As for the latter, the film's main challenge wasn't showing a guy having his flashy day in court but rather a long slog as it was taking a toll on his life. The film handles this challenge in pacing admirably. More than that, the film flies on the strength of its central relationship. You never think of Ryan Reynolds (best known for subversive leading men or a smug action stars) and Helen Mirren as occupying the same universe but the chemistry between the two goes a long way towards making this film transformative. The film is a powerful one about remembrance and loss. It teaches that one can't fix the past, but healing those wounds is a noble cause.",9,7,7,23 February 2017
National Treasure," a new kind of film
","National Treasure gives a new meaning to the phrase 'living history', and it really is something thoroughly amazing for a work of historical fiction. It is entwined in a gripping mystery which uses as reference points, things you can find in your pocket, like a dollar bill, places you've probably been to like the national archives, the mall in D.C. etc, making for a truly interactive experience.Complaints about lack of character depth in National Treasure should be made keeping in mind the context in which Bruckenheimer (did i spell that right?) made the film. If you're Jerry Bruckheimer, you went from being a very hot commodity after making a $285 million-grossing film, Pirates of the Caribbean, to making King Arthur, a flop, and you want to preserve your reputation as a commercial success. Therefore, you're #1 goal is to get people into the theater and what's gonna get them there is the plot. The movie is all plot-centered and even though Nicholas Cage might have won an Oscar way back when the truth is that most of his movies 'gone in 60 seconds', 'snake eyes', '8 mm', etc, are not films you go to expecting character development.I don't think they were aiming for character depth: No one was going into this film thinking they'd snag an Oscar or golden globe nomination, Not that you shouldn't want to have a challenging part to want to act in, but I was pretty fine with the limit on character development because the plot was cool enough. The one thing I can say was, at the very least the characters were self-conscious, for example, the Abby Chase/Ben Gates hook up we could all see coming from miles away, but evidently so could the screenwriter so he gave Ian the line 'well, you got the girl at the end' cause it's so blatantly obvious.Also, the plot is absurd in itself, stealing the declaration of independence? And it's actually quite a wonder in itself that the movie presented a historically accurate, seemingly plausible and thoroughly engaging plot out of the circumstances that in no way dumbs down to the audience. Making the plot work in itself, deserves credit.The film played to its strengths well.",8,0,0,20 December 2004
Hoosiers," Hoosiers is a good example of a film that moves too fast
","Hoosiers is a good example of a film that moves too fast. Gene Hackman stars as a new high school basketball coach in small-town Indiana. He tries to do his best despite the absence of the school's two best players. The first player is a sure bet to turn around Hackman's new basketball program but some random hot teacher who also is the boy's unofficial guardian, who Hackman has a crush on, won't let him play because she wants him to focus on academics. The second player, who's not as good, is just flat-out disrespectful to him and walks out on him, and Hackman stands his ground and says, 'fine, don't return.' This leaves the coach with a short-handed rotation to work with, but Hackman, who is supposed to be the story's hero, naturally acts unphased and dispenses the following advice: 'pass the ball three times before shooting it.' Although it sounds brilliant when he says it, they still lose. Then, all of a sudden, 'Scooter', the hot teacher's surrogate nephew, magically changes his mind, joins the team, they start winning and the rest is history. There's really a lack of anything gradual here, the big obstacles are all suddenly overcome and it just takes away the drama. Sure, the film is filled with those clichéd scenes where in the middle of a game en route to their state championship, they're one-point down with three seconds on the clock and they MIGHT lose if they don't make the basket, but without seeing the strenuous process by which the coach and the team turned themselves around, the payoff just isn't rewarding. The film is a classic among Indiana basketball fans and rightly so. The state's love of basketball is something special, and despite the lack of story, the film still portrays the heart of basketball country very well. Sadly, the story is too formulaic and devoid of drama. Did I also mention that the bickering hot teacher and the coach hook up later in the movie? Well, the movie is so predictable you'd have figured that out anyway. Two stars (out of 4)",Null,0,4,9 May 2004
The Da Vinci Code," Howard makes good out of a losing situation
","Critics so far are giving Da Vinci code mixed reviews but when you're making a film based on a book that apparently has sold more copies than any book since the Bible (as Roger Ebert notes: 'good thing it had a different ending') the expectations are going to be hard to live up to. The other mistake critics are making is that they're judging the film along the lines of how controversial it is, and are lampooning the usually middle-of-the-road Ron Howard for once again playing it too safe. That makes no sense to me: a movie has to have picketers at its premiere to be considered successful? The fact is that Howard is in a damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't situation with the material and he skirted the controversy smartly by just focusing on making a good movie and even if by sticking to the book he won't get the credit for the great story, that's still exactly what he did.For those of you that didn't read the book, The Da Vinci Code is an intelligent thriller that starts out with a murder at an art museum in France, and a Harvard professor of symbology, Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called upon to help decipher the victim's dying message. Making their way into the story at intersecting points and building up the suspense level are a French cryptologist and granddaughter of the victim, a police chief with a vendetta (Reno), a bishop who heads a controversial sect of Christianity (Molina), a murderous albino monk (Bettany) and an obsessive British aristocrat (McKellan). The story is filled with cliffhangers and surprises at every turn and the film pretty much follows that same pace, being careful not to cut out too much of the interesting tidbits that made the book so interesting in the first place. The story's genius, after all, comes from playing with familiar historical events suggesting they didn't happen exactly the way we thought they did.For those of you who have read the book, don't worry, it's not by any means an exact copy of the book. Things are cut and moved around and at least a couple of key elements are changed for the better. For example, Bezu Fache, the policeman, is a member of Opus Dei in the film, which makes for more sensible character motives, and Robert Langdon is a religious man which makes for a slightly more open-ended approach to the religious controvoursey. What really makes the movie work, however, is the casting. Audrey Tatou, Paul Bettany, and Ian McKellan are all vastly underrated actors who give Tom Hanks great support and enhance the movie. McKellan's devious scholar seems to comes straight out of an Indiana Jones movie, and Paul Bettany makes Silas the albino monk sufficiently scary but surprisingly human at the same time.",9,3,6,27 May 2006
War of the Worlds," Spielberg takes same story in different direction
","My main concern going into this film was that I've seen it before and I'm not talking about the 1950s movie or the famous 1930s radio broadcast. I was thinking more in this case of the 1997 summer blockbuster hit Independence Day, and while a film being a remake doesn't automatically drive me away, I really couldn't see where this movie could go that its predecessors hadn't already explored. Independence Day, after all, was a scientifically updated version with state-of-the-art special effects, and it's not like science has gotten THAT much more modern in the last 8 years.I was proved wrong. With Independence Day, director Ronald Emmerich managed to recreate H.G. Wells' original 'World' vision into a modern epic by showing us things on a truly global scale (he also showed his talent for globally scaled drama in 2004's Day After Tomorrow). War of the Worlds, on the other hand, tells the same story from the point-of-view of a single family's journey through the crisis.The film's genius lies in how little he wavers from that vision. It's uncompromising in leaving the questions unanswered that this plot naturally lends itself to being asked (such as 'what are these aliens doing here?', 'where did they come from?', etc.). As a result, we went through the movie experiencing and learning about the danger at the same time the characters were. The effect was so pervasive it feels more than anything else like a 2-hour roller coaster ride, no doubt enhanced by Spielberg's deft camera-work, which for the first time since Jaws reminding us of his unrivaled brand of terror with which he revolutionized blockbusters 30 years ago in Jaws.As with other films of his, Spielberg adds an estranged-father-and-son plot on top of the main story, with Tom Cruise as custody-sharing blue collar dad Ray Ferrier and Justin Chatwik as the rebellious son, with Dakota Fanning added as a loving young daughter for contrast. The relationships between Cruise and his two kids, both of whom carry significant loads of the script with precision, adds a whole new depth to the action scenes. As for Cruise, for all his crazy antics that have been filling the newspapers lately, he shows definite growth in this role and doesn't just carry this film with a mistimed sparkling grin, but with a convincing-yet-firm display of fatherly emotion.",8,1,3,14 July 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," best comedy i have seen in years
","Two summers ago, I saw Anchorman and was completely blown away. I am sure I am the minority in thinking it was one of the best films of the year, but when done well a pure comedy can be just as much a show of great film-making as anything else. Anchorman, a spoof of chauvinism and male insecurity, is set in a 1970s newsroom in San Diego where star news anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and his news team become threatened by the arrival of a woman (Christina Applegate) in the newsroom.Anchorman is the best display of improvisational comedy on screen since Christopher Guest (This is Spinal Tap, Best in Show). It's jokes come from the creation of funny characters. The beauty of Anchorman wasn't so much the comic intensity of Will Ferrell, but the fact that every other actor in the movie could keep up with him in creating such zany characters. Paul Rudd, David Koechner and Steve Carrell as Ferrell's team of sidekicks all have breakout roles as his news anchor team and Applegate matches Ferrell line-for-line in their battle-of-the-sexes rivalry. Together, they all provide so much comic energy and mine comic situations to such extremes, that it had me laughing throughout the entire movie.",9,0,1,29 August 2006
Kong: Skull Island," A bit squeamish-inducing but plenty of bang for the buck
","Owing a bit more to the James Cameronesque horror of grotesquely-shaped beasts than to the simplistic awe of a majestic beast, Kong: Skull Island is an effective nail biter. It's not for the squeamish, however.With the genuine shocks of adrenaline and the action geared towards 3-D viewing, Kong: Skull Island feels like a two-hour roller coaster ride but there's an honest attempt at characterization and story.There's a loosely-established mythology that Kong is the last of his kind and protector to a tribe of very indigenous looking people and a necessary balance to the ecosystem from the dangers of a very ugly creature called the skull duggers and yada yada yada. The film's need for moral parable is precipitated by the fact that Samuel L Jackson (who normally plays such level-headed characters) plays a military commander who's attitudes towards animals are evil with a capital 'E' which sets up the main narrative conflict of the film, prompting the need for the good guys to step in and rescue Kong from animal cruelty. Perhaps, it's because of the Vietnam setting that the film has an anti-military stance as Jackson's character represents militarism run amok.Chief among the good guys is a castaway played by John C. Rielly who is both a throwback to 50's B-movies (other reviews liken him to 'Apocalypse Now') and an endearing character in his own right as a castaway who has been stranded on Kong Island for nearly three decades. Brie Larson makes her first big post-Oscar move in style as a Ripley-esque action heroine and Thomas Hiddlestone proves that this guy has a future as a leading man (piggybacking on his great performance in the in 'Night Manager').'Kong: Skull Island' is beautifully shot and highly entertaining provided you can stomach it.",8,15,29,11 March 2017
The Good Shepherd," A little long but worth it
","The Good Shephard starts out a little slow and clocks in a little long (over 2 ½ hours) but it's a story that sooner or later hooks you.Much hyped for the fact that Robert De Niro is directing it, The Good Shephard is marketed as a film that takes the viewer through the origin and the first 20 years of the CIA. The movie does act as a historical retrospect, but unlike recent docudramas like Bobby or Catch a Fire, the film is smart in not making it more about the journey of a character than a history lesson. It's far more based on a character's journey.At the story's center, Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, who is recruited to the CIA from a secret Ivy League society. He's stoic, cold, and enigmatic and the strength of the movie is that the question of why he does what he does is never fully answered. It's only hinted at and revealed in the film's last act as the plot branches out towards Wilson's relationships with his estranged wife (Jolie), son (Redmayne), and the love that never was (Blanchard).The film boasts an all-star cast. Some of them like Joe Pesci were probably brought into the project solely because of their connections to De Niro, but the movie does feature strong performances from everyone, particularly Jolie, Blanchard. Matt Damon does a great restrained performance although it stretches the credibility of the part that he ages 20 years and his son grows up and he still looks like he's under 30.The film's big production values; its noirish score and carefully constructed mise-en-scenes; make a boastful statement that the film is about something big and it's well deserved.",6,17,31,17 December 2006
Finding Dory," A sequel with purpose an flair
","For its grandiose reputation as a creative mecca, even Pixar has been unable to resist the Faustian bargain of a sequel every now and then. While Ellen DeGeneres' popularity and 'Toy Story 3''s Oscar nomination made a sequel inevitable, it shouldn't be discounted that Dory (DeGeneres) was deservedly a breakout character in her own right when she debuted thirteen years ago as Marlon's (Albert Brooks) memory-addled sidekick. The circuitous dialogue resulting from Dory's short-term memory loss makes for the kind of back-and- forth of an updated Abbott and Costello routine. Similarly, Dory's chipper attitude in the face of her (presupposed) inability to accomplish anything outside a 30-second window makes her a spunky can-do everyman.The challenge coming into 'Finding Dory' is similar to nearly every TV spin-off from Gomer Pyle to Joey: Can the comic relief carry their own storyline? In this case, yes: It turns out there's a lot of depth to Dory when you factor in the potential that her memory could resurface and, indeed, that's the route we go down.Dory begins to experience flashbacks that take her, Nemo, and a reluctant Marlon (taking each other for granted is a theme here) all the way to a Seaworld-like aquarium in California where Dory, Nemo, and Marlin find themselves in and out of various rooms and fish tanks. Lack of opposable limbs or bodies larger than three inches be damned, this is the Pixar universe and pesky human contraptions like doors are no match for you if you have determination and some crafty friends to help. These include a beluga whale (Ty Burrell) with echolocation, a near-sighted whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), and a curmudgeon of an octopus whose congruence with voice actor Ed O'Neill's screen persona makes him the film's breakout character. If you're someone with a deep-seated love for aquariums and Jacques Cousteau like me, there's an enchantment in the animation that you would never get from the renderings of toys, ants, superheroes, or dystopian garbage piles that Pixar has previously done. There's also the added bonus of the biological accuracy and the clever ways in which these traits are ingrained in their characters. High-quality animated flicks typically come with moral parables and the original one here is the way that people with disabilities can contribute to society and are capable of surprise. Although Dory couldn't really navigate the freeways of California, it all feels surprisingly organic here.",9,0,3,14 March 2017
The Terminal," One of Spielberg's more lightweight projects, stays in place with style
","Spielberg can make a great story out of anything with his packages of sounds, sights, and story lines that elevate his work above that of mortal filmmakers. That being said, it's interesting to see him working his magic here on a story so devoid of movement. By that, I mean that compared to Jaws, Raiders, of the Ark or Schindler's List or even a more lightweight contraption like Catch Me if you Can, this isn't a movie where a lot of things happen. This is a slower paced movie that's really about the characters and the nuance of the arena and what more fascinating arena is there than an airport? On that level, the movie is meticulously crafted and sells the setting. Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a man from a fictitious country who through a bureaucratic glitch is trapped in John F. Kennedy Airport. It's based on a real-life story about an Iranian man who flew to Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport as the Iranian revolution occurred and found that the country listed on his passport was no longer in existence when he landed, and interestingly enough the man is still there. Historical accuracy is not this film's priority and for that matter, neither is any kind of realistic portrayal about the way an airport is run. The film is, more than anything, an abstraction: it treats the airport as not just the place we've all been through, an intermediary point on a longer journey; but as a state of mind as well. Because of that, unanswered questions about why Navorski's friends don't ever seemingly go home at the end of the day or how flight attendant Emilia Warren (Zeta-Jones) can have so much free time for a full-fledged romance on her layovers don't really need answers. The movie surrounds its protagonist with a traditional nemesis in Stanley Tucci as by-the-book airport official Frank Dixon, a love interest (Zeta-Jones), and Chi McBride, Diego Luna and Kumar Pallana as various airport employees who serve as his entrouage. In some cases, particularly with Tucci's character whose actions are seemingly guided for no other reason other than to be the opposite of those of the protagonist, the film seems to be trying too hard to fit square pegs into round holes. In the end, however, the story ties together leaving you with a warm feeling that in this case is well-earned.",8,1,2,23 October 2005
The Blind Side," The Blind Side
","The Blind Side rode sentimental appeal, a star performance, and a respectable box office draw to an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The film tells the true story of Michael Oher, a homeless teenager who became an NFL player and college graduate with the help of a loving family (played by Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw).The story runs into the same problem as another 2009 film, Invictus, in the sense that by being true to the events as they happened, there is a lack of conflict. In the real-life counterpart Blind Side, I might have expected, due to the fact that the story takes place in Central Tennessee and a white family is taking in a black teenager that it would be story largely about racism. In real life, however, Leigh Ann Tuohy was remarkably colorblind and so was her husband and the movie doesn't dare contradict that. A couple confused relatives and a suspicious NCAA infractions investigator is about all we get for a reminder of racial tension in the deep south, but hey, it's the post-racial era, what can we expect?In spite of that, this is a picture that works. The drama is authentic but it also engages because it's centered around a struggle that takes many forms and stages: the central figure has to learn to open himself up, to trust, to succeed on the field and in the classroom, etc.As for the acting, Sandra Bullock has a strong consistency to the way she approaches the character. The real-life woman is somewhat of an enigma in her motivations and Bullock makes it believable. Quinton Aaron is amazing and had as much of a role in carrying the movie as Bullock. He has such presence (partially because of his size) but appears so uncomfortable with that presence at first and gradually transform into it.Kathy Bates shouldn't be so heavily advertised because her role basically amounts to a cameo.",8,1,1,23 December 2015
Music and Lyrics," Decent film
","Based around the rather flimsy premise that a musician falls into a state of creative desperation that a thesaurus couldn't fix whenever he has to come up with a new single, 'Music and Lyrics' stars Hugh Grant as a has-been writer and Drew Barrymore as an aspiring writer who through happenstance circumstances, team up to write a song that could put them on the map.Hugh Grant plays his witty self in Alex Fletcher, with the exception that his character is actually surprisingly convincing as a pop star. He delivers those one-liners that can single-handedly deliver a movie like 'Two Weeks Notice,' with a little less frequency than what might have let this movie get by on humor alone. Drew Barrymore, as slogan-writer Sophie Fisher enters Alex's life as her plant lady (is there a such thing as a plant lady?). When he discovers her talents for rhyming, he recruits her to help write lyrics for a teen pop star who gives him a chance at a comeback. The pop star is played by Haley Bennett who as a parody of the empty spiritualism of Hollywood is one of the best parts of the movie. The film isn't funny enough to recommend as a pure comedy and while Grant mixes it up a little, Barrymore doesn't do anything she hasn't done before here. Still the script manages to stay intelligent and natural enough that it keeps the film afloat. Even before Alex and Sophie get romantically involved, their characters are interesting enough for us to want to know more about them and their interactions are too.I ultimately gave this movie 2 1/2 stars (or 5 out of 10) because it dragged on a little long in the middle. I would categorize it as decent.",5,0,1,23 May 2007
The Queen," An interesting piece in that it's really 2 movies
","The Queen is very interesting in that it works as two entirely different movies depending on the audience. To a British citizen or an Anglophile, the movie works as a political docudrama taking an interested viewer further behind the scenes of a historic event that they're already intimately familiar with, much like 'All the President's Men' or 'Good Night and Good Luck.' Watching 'The Queen' is the current events equivalent to rewatching your favorite movie on DVD with a commentary track.At the same time, to those like myself who aren't well-versed with the cultural and political complexities of the UK and who watched the clamor surrounding Princess Diana's death with passing disinterest, it was more of a period piece: an epic tale that makes for both a story composed of historical facts as well as a parable of lessons relatable to our current state of society.The main challenge, therefore, is to make detached viewers like myself care enough about these characters, which it does increasingly so as the film progresses.The film starts out as a portrait of an aging political figure facing a dying way of life that will diminish her power and perhaps deservedly so. Queen Elizabeth II, played by Helen Mirren, is confronted with the recent ascension to power of a new Prime Minister, Tony Blair, who is seen as a possible threat to her prestige for championing modernization and various other liberal causes. Their relationship forms over a crisis over how the Royal Family should properly respond to the death of Princess Diana, who is a thorn in the Royal Family's side for disowning the royal way of life. Since she is loved by the masses, she serves as a fairly obvious representation of the dichotomy between tradition and modernity that is at the film's center.The film's strength, however, is that it doesn't pigeonhole its two main characters as the personification of either of those two sides. Each is a more complex person trying to navigate their ways through the pressures that those sides and people on them present. At its heart, 'The Queen' is about the common ground that must be met between two very different political figures, and the possible friendship they form out of it. The film preaches that with democracy in the hands of the masses, everyone at the top is just as likely to be misunderstood by their subjects and power is a delicate thing.The film is currently in the running for a best picture Oscar nomination and while it succeeds at what it is trying to do and serves as an interesting study of politics and class conflict, it doesn't have the gravitas to it that I feel would merit it an academy award nomination, especially in a year as competitive as this one.",7,2,4,9 January 2007
1408," 1408 doesn't work on screen
","1408 is a thriller that sets few narrative rules for itself in trying to establish its thrills.The premise established in an introduction that doesn't even try to hide the film's silliness is that a skeptical writer of ghost stories (John Cusack in a role that's miscast on the grounds that it resembles his persona in 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' too closely) travels to his latest conquest: not the usual haunted house but, instead, a room within an elegant hotel, that's said to be haunted. According to the hotel manager (Samuel L Jackson) the room is never checked out but the hotel chain wants to keep the outward appearance that there' nothing wrong with the room to make the other customers feel comfortable. Jackson's character tells Cusack's character incredible stories of how haunted the room and how once a maid stayed in the room too long and slit her wrists, or something like that in a scene that plays off as too melodramatic. The writer's cynicism is too strong for the hotel manager's appeal and he decides to take the room. Of course once he gets there, bad things happen but the audience can see that coming from a mile away.What 1408 ultimately comes down to is an adaptation problem. The film was adapted from Stephen King's short story which probably worked great as an Edgar Allen Poe-type exploration of the darker recesses of the human mind. On screen, however, the mobius strip plot contraptions wear thin. With nearly everything on screen happening only in the character's mind, there's little reason to care.",4,13,24,4 July 2007
Vanilla Sky," 1 1/2 stars
","On the bright side, Cameron Crowe can take solace in the fact that thanks to Rush Hour 2, Tomb Raider, and Swordfish, Vanilla Sky is safe from being the worst film of its year. I am a big fan of Cameron Crowe and intrigued by Paul McCartney's title song, I thought this could be good but I was let down. The film stars Tom Cruise as...um, I don't remember the guy's name but it's really not important, Tom Cruise basically plays the same guy he always plays. The chief characteristics of the basic Tom Cruise character is he's 1) God's gift to women 2) Bold and very confident and 3) Has a chip on his shoulder, often something to do with a deceased father figure. Given the right plot, Tom Cruise can usually work well because the character progresses and usually brings the cockiness down to Earth while overcoming that chip on his shoulder, and we often root for him through the whole process because of attribute #1, woman find him good-looking and guys generally think he's pretty cool.        The problem is that there really isn't much of a plot here, so the movie is just on pretty faulty ground with Cruise as the protagonist, and the film eventually falls flat. The movie starts out pretty normal, Cruise wakes up next to Cameron Diaz, a friend who sleeps with him, and goes to work as a business executive, where has to deal with the board that co-owns the company and don't think that Cruise is as qualified as the company's former owner, his father (that's attribute #3). Cruise than goes to a party and falls in love with Penelope Cruz, who's not as easy to get into bed as Cameron Diaz. Yes, Cruise forms a solid friendship with her and is enthusiastic about meeting her cause, as I said he's in love. Then, Cruise is driving around with Cameron Diaz and she bursts with rage over being used by him, and she drives the car over a bridge. Yep, that kind of threw you for a loop, if you were hearing about the storyline for the first time, didn't it?         The real plot kind of gets underway here, but as I said, it's not much of a plot, at least in my opinion. Tom Cruise survives the crash but he's pretty badly injured, that's about the basics. Past that, things are going on in the storyline but not in any real discernable order, and reality just kind of becomes blurred. I won't give away too much, but if you stick with the movie, towards the end, things got a little easier to figure out. However, there's a lot of screentime here, where nothing's really even that easy to understand or that watchable. Also, the film has a sort of dark and depressing tone, and since the darkness didn't really serve any function, i thought that brought down the movie.       One of the bright spots of the movie, however, was Penelope Cruz. She really lit up the screen and it was easy to see why Tom Cruise was falling in love with her.       Past that, the other characters serve little purpose. Cameron Diaz is basically there to hammer in attribute #1 of Cruise's character, because she's very hot herself and her willingness to have sex with him without strings just so she can get closer to him. It makes her a really degrading person, but it makes it easier for Cruise to convince us that his character in this movie is God's gift to women. Jason Lee plays Cruise's best friend and helps develop attribute #2, Cruise's confidence. Because Lee's a complete pushover and clearly is the more subservient one in their friendship, considering how he give up Penelope Cruise for her, how could Cruise not be confident?             In short, this was an admirable experiment for Cameron Crowe, I still like his stuff, I even liked some of his small touches, but a lot of the things in the movie just didn't work at all for me.",2,0,1,1 May 2004
The Dark Knight Rises," The best Batman film by miles
","The Dark Knight Rises was the pivotal success of Batman if you consider that Batman Begins had too much exposition and Dark Knight was so focused on the Joker and his omnipotent brand of evil, that it made for more of a horror story than an event film. The Dark Knight Rises really was the optimal blend of ingredients that one would come to expect in a Nolan film. Like Inception and Prestige, it was an epic story with twists that unraveled satisfyingly. More importantly, the film really was about Batman which is a hard chore considering he is usually always upstaged by more interesting and colorful visions in pretty much every auteur's vision of Gotham city.The story lines are and expertly juggled and the production quality is top notch. It's also fair to say that the emotional content of a Batman film has never resonated so well with me and I even found it more realistic (and slightly amusing) that the facade of Batman wasn't kept sacred and pretty much every character just said 'screw it, he's Bruce Wayne.'",10,3,7,15 May 2013
Bruce Almighty," *** Stars: Jim Carrey finds solid ground
","Jim Carrey, who has thoroughly explored bathroom humor and Frank Capraesque drama, finds a very comfortable balance here. The plot: Carey is a newsman in Buffalo whose frustrations over his unmet aspirations to be a news anchor cause him to challenge God himself. God, in the form of Morgan Freeman, accepts his challenge setting up a pretty decent opportunity for some laughs. The choice to put Carrey's character in Buffalo rather than the New York City where most movies are set, seems to resonate in a symbolic sense, as the world Carrey inhabits always seems to be a little off the norm. Aside from Carrey's comedy, and a convincing performance by Morgan Freeman (as convincing as humanly possible, that is, considering he's playing God), I liked this movie because at heart it's very uplifting and speaks great truths about the power of love and `being a miracle.'",7,0,1,7 June 2004
Casino Royale," Time for a change
","The 20th Bond installation of Die Another Day was more of a celebration that the franchise had lasted 40 years than it was a look to the future of the Bond franchise. In other words, there was never really much of a continuation point from Die Another Day planned by the franchise and which viewers would have liked seeing. By that time, it seemed, we were getting sick of some things about James Bond: How he never bleeds and always gets the right cards and the right gadgets at the right time.This new installment of the Bond franchise is a film with trade-offs. The biggest, of course, is that it is refreshing to see Bond bleed, Bond lose a hand of cards, Bond be wrong, and Bond actually fall in love. At the same time, some of the familiar elements of Bond are missing and there's something that's lost when that happens. There's no Moneypenny, no villainous girl, and especially Q. Bonds toys don't really look like Q's gadgets, they just look like those high-end gizmos you find in your skymall catalogue. I'm not sure which version of Bond I like better, but maybe it was the right time for a change. It also helps that James Bond is played by an Oscar-caliber actor (he hasn't won an Oscar yet, but he could easily win one in between James Bond films, he got buzz for Munich and Infamous and was also in Road to Perdition) who could go way above and beyond Bond if need be. Pierce Brosnam never seemed to be more than an action hero, and his best roles outside of Bond, After the Sunset and Matador, are notable only because they parody his action hero type.",6,1,6,11 September 2007
X2: X-Men United," 4 Stars
","With much of the exposition out of the way, the second installment of the X-Men is much freer to develop its characters and engage in some summer fun along the way. The film benefits from its large and talented ensemble, which includes a number of new heroes and villains entering the scene. New characters include a vanishing monk named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) and a conflicted teenager with firepower named Pyro (Shawn Ashmore). Of course, we're treated to a brand new villain (Bryan Cox), which adds a new dimension to the battle of good vs. evil as the good guys and bad guys are forced to enter into a temporary alliance and some riveting complications result thereafter. Overall, Bryan Singer has the challenging task of navigating the complexities of this comic and showing the appealing side of this band of misfits, and he comes through in flying colors",10,0,0,31 May 2004
Rear Window," Impressive Movie
","This is one of the best murder mysteries I've seen because of Hitchkock's artistry. Like 12 Angry Men, it's very simple. The simplicity is  used to Hitchkock's advantage. He draws up an intricate murder plot just from one scene. That deserves credit. It's an original and creative way to view a murder story. The acting was also great.",7,3,5,13 August 1999
Pitch Perfect," Anna Kendrick
","Pitch Perfect is a surprisingly fun film that goes about as emotionally deep as it needs to without getting overly mushy. The storyline is of a reluctant college student (Anna Kendrick) who learns to open herself up more to people and possibilities through joining an a capella group. Anna Kendrick, who's been nominated for an Academy Award, is probably too good for a film like this, but thank God the producers were able to get her because she gives her all and elevates the film significantly.The film, adapted from a book wherein the author spent significant amount of time with 3 college a capella groups, delves deep into the a capella world and it's clear that the filmmakers have done their research and this sets this film apart from the typical coming-of-age college film as we're taken deep into the world of this subculture. The music itself is also very entertaining..Although there's a sort of love-hate romance (wherein the boy's primary method of winning over the girl is annoying her to death), the film is all about girl power and how this loner learns to bond with other females for the first time and (excuse the pun) make beautiful music. With Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam Driver, Anna Camp, and Rebel Wilson, the supporting cast has a great chemistry despite the fact that it's difficult to believe some of these people are 18-22 years old (Anna Camp and Rebel Wilson in particular)The film's screenplay is by Kay Canon (who has written for 30 Rock and is well-known in comedy circles) and while there are some laughs, it's not primarily a comedy. It IS a fun film.",8,2,4,7 June 2013
Click," moves a bit too quickly to care, a step backwards for Sander
","I have to confess at the start of this review that I'm not really an Adam Sandler fan. In fact, I might have been the only person in my 6th grade class who didn't see what was so great about Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. It's not that I like appreciation for crude low-brow humor from SNL alumni. I happen to like Will Ferrell, Norm McDonald, and the David Spade/Chris Farley buddy comedies, but Adam Sandler is just a guy who I don't get. There might be times where I laugh during his movies but I see that as a result of so many random bizarre jokes being thrown out at me, that by sheer luck a couple of them actually work. What I think we like about Sandler, isn't necessarily the comedy but it's the warmth behind his movies. I think it's because he's such a lovable character that we love to cheer for Billy Madison to win his high school diploma or for Bobby Bouche to save the day for his coach in The Waterboy.For me, Sandler movies have gotten better as he's seemed to refine his humor and grounded it more in those uplifting story elements with 50 First Dates, Mr. Deeds, and Big Daddy. Unfortunately, Click is a giant step backwards for Sandler. It's disjointed and feels like it's moving too quickly for us to care much, despite a touching scene near the end. By detaching us from any sense of caring what happens to the characters, the film hits rocky ground, because that leaves us with nothing but Sandler's sense of humor to entice us. What's even odder, the laughs are noticeably fewer and farther in between than most Adam Sandler movies. Then again, that might have been a good thing, considering how bizarre Sandler's jokes can be. And don't think 'bizarre' is funny because anyone can access the most random corners of their mind and come up with bizarre stuff. The most random corner of Adam Sandler's mind is filled with things like a dog repeatedly humping a stuffed animal and parents who mock the size of their son's 'schmiekel' (don't ask). The funny moments that actually worked well in the movie are things you can catch in the 30-second trailer anyway.",1,15,38,18 July 2006
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," So far removed from reality, it just became stupid
","I know it sounds silly to say I want more realism from a film about four talking zoo animals, but Madagascar III was so far removed from any sense of internal logic or consistency that it was just plain stupid.Very little about the first Madagascar falls out of line with reality. They even go so far as to explain why the animals can't talk: When the quartet is nearly apprehended at Grand Central Station and Alex (the lion) tries to reason with the crowd but his speaking comes out as roaring.The third Madagascar got so ridiculous, I eventually tuned its attempts at making sense out like white noise. We have the animals deciding to swim halfway across the planet, a tiger who can jump through a wedding ring, the circus now being run by chimpanzees and selling out to a human audience, and a lion suddenly learning the trapeze.None of the new plot developments are particularly additive. In one, Sasha Baron Cohen's lemur monkey falls madly in love with a big bear (which by the way, is kind of gross) and the two go to the Vatican to kiss the pope's hand and get his blessing. What?! I'm not sure where the pope stands on monkey-bear unions but at least the first and second installments had a clearly spelled out humans-animals relationship.The movie also feels rushed. It wasn't just the actual running time of 93 minutes, but the storyline weaved its way from one plot point to another at right angles with no transition. The gang decides to go to Monte Carlo and are suddenly there one scene later. One scene after that, they're being chased out of Monte Carlo and onto the next adventure. There's a weary Russian tiger played by Bryan Cranston who warns against clichés and nearly quits the circus but is talked out of it in 30 seconds by Alex. What do you call a sudden 180 reversal like that again? Oh yes, it's a cliché.",2,36,58,15 May 2013
Joy," There's something entrancing about this film
","I'm writing this within a couple days of the Oscar nomination announcements, and it's very likely that Joy won't get the accolades as David O Russell's previous films but that's not to say that this isn't a worthy accomplishment on its own.Jennifer Lawrence (in her third collaboration with David O Russell) plays a single mom with big aspirations and a family that weighs her down. From a an ex-husband (Edgar Ramirez) and father (Robert DeNiro, also in his third collaboration with David O Russell) who want to crash with her, to a judgmental sister, to a mother (Virginia Madsen) who's resigned to laying in bad watching soap operas, there's a lot of dead weight.Lawrence seeks to up her station in life through inventing a miracle mop and it's a long hard road ahead for her.The film is part adult family drama and part capitalist love story and both parts are infused with the inventiveness David O Russell produced with American Hustle. Joy is kinetic, enthusiastic, and, like American Hustle, the story is based on the instincts of the actors rather than the historical facts. It's an interesting way to make a 'based on a true story' film and I'm glad that Russell is continuing to develop his method.A lot of the movie's emotional base lies in rich relationships. David O Russell has said in interviews that he was attracted to the project because it boasted the 'Best divorced couple in America' which is just a little objectionable because it isn't until a couple scenes in that Edgar Ramirez's character stops being a dead weight and actually helping. There is a lot to praise, performance-wise, as long as the relationships are working, however, and Ramirez starts really shining when he's getting along with Joy. De Niro, Madsen, and Lawrence shine but that's always a given.If you like what David O Russell did with American Hustle, this film is definitely for you.",9,0,5,12 January 2016
The Breakfast Club," a good 80s film, but then again, who likes the 80s?
","2 1/2 Stars: The Breakfast Club was arguably the most definitive teen angst film of the 80s, but then again, the 80s were a pretty bad decade for teenager films so that's not saying much. The film is about a group of five high school students who are forced to spend a day-long detention with each other.
The group comprises of a jock, a bully, a nerd, a beauty queen and a freak. These are five of the most blandly stereotypical characters ever to appear in a film, and even though this is a deliberate action designed to give the actors leverage so that they could more easily be dynamic later in the film, it's blatantly obvious. The teenagers, interact with each other in ways that they otherwise wouldn't have had they not been forced to spend a Saturday together. The strongest part about the film is that there's a lot of good dialogue as the ragtag group starts going through the mundane activities of trying to stop the school bully from getting them in trouble or asking for a piece of gum, to having conversation in which they get to know each other and finding they all had more in common, than they realized.However, if ever a potentially good film was set back by the ending, The Breakfast Club would have to be one of the best examples. If the idea was that these teenagers of different social classes were going to learn that they had more in common than they realized and eventually tear down those barriers, than why does the film end with the status quo, where the beauty queen ends up with the bad boy, and everyone gets together with someone except for the nerd who ends up having to write the group paper?",5,2,7,5 July 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," ****: Best sequel ever
","Those who say the Godfather II is the only really good sequel, need to take another close look at this movie. I honestly do not get why this movie is so overlooked. Raiders of the Lost Ark  is acclaimed by critics as one of the greatest of all time, and it was very popular, but I personally think that this movie goes a step beyond the original. It has a lot going for it. For one, let's go to the fascinating religion verse science concept that presents itself in here. In the original, the ark appears, and everything is restored back to normal. A consequence-free, direct line from Point A to Point B ending. This one the whole issue is building up inside. The stakes are raised until Indiana Jones himself is presented with the ultimate challenge: disreguard everything about archeology and make a leap of faith. Additionally, the father-son relationship is great. The chemistry between the two glamorous stars is amazing. How often does a hero got involved in some kind of father-son dynamic. The complexities of their relationship are displayed through the subtleties in their conversations. They make a great team too. Their interactions are comical and almost-TV like but there's also a lot of noticeable sediment and chemistry. The status relationship is very interesting. As a kid, who obeyed his father without question. I love how Indiana's father is clearly less qualified to fight off the Nazis and is really an obstacle to Indiana, yet the whole father-is-superior complex exists. Sean Connery's character is difenitiely multi-demensional. He's passionate, educated, smart, a little touristy, and has a little touch of that James Bond charisma. Harrison Ford is riveting as always as the likable Indiana Jones. As for the villans, we got the seductive-but-passionate Austrian Archeologist and the professor. Of course, don't forget the equally intriguing and quirky sidekicks which include the clumsy but smart Marcus Brody, and Sallah, who was in Raiders of the Lost Ark. If that isn't enough, how about the whole Nazi angle, and the good vs evil, that's very delicately played into the story. Who could make a better enemy than the Nazis? And I love the tracing Indy from birth to adulthood idea, where parallels are drawn between the Cross of Coronado, his smile, and his hat. The story is cleverly set in different settings, where we really have a sense of segments. It's like a story happens in Venice and a completely different story happens in Saudi Arabia or Austria. Every part of the story line is plausible and well-crafted. And lastly, thumbs up for the action. Not as good as the original movie, but still always clever, always dramatic, and always exciting. The action is clouded with miles of suspense, from the boat chasing scene, to the one with the tanks in the desert, to the scene where they outrun the Nazis in the forest. In short, this movie is incredible, packed with non-stop action, fun, and adventure.",10,0,1,9 June 2004
Back to the Future," **** Stars: Very underrated film
","This is probably the most underrated trilogy of the 20th century, and in my personal opinion it's almost up there with Indiana Jones and Star Wars in terms of adventure and fun. It's perhaps the best science-fiction film, in terms of having widespread appeal while still being also appealing to those intrigued by the Time Travel angle. I do maintain, however, that this is at heart, a sci-fi film, maybe not in par with TV shows like Babylon 5 or Star Trek: The Next Generation in its complexity, but Doc and his time traveling contraption are really the movie's main draw, and furthermore, I think that the movie has enough scientific exploration within it, that it appeals to those scientifically-minded thinkers within ourselves.At the same time, it mixes the science up with comedy, action, and romance, and practically everything else, and that's why I think this practically everyone who's seen this has liked it.The ensemble gets a lot of mileage, just out of playing with type. Michael J Fox plays the epitome of the rebellious teenager of the 80s, Christopher Lloyd's mad scientist doc, who initiates the whole adventure, comes straight out of a comic-book, and just the same, it's probably the best performance of his career. Also, the protagonist's dad, George, and his nemesis Biff, are found in the standard nerd and bully roles. Adding to a great ensemble, this is just an all-around solid film, the special effects are great, the soundtrack (Alan Silvestri) is one of my favorites, and it's just, overall, a lot of fun.",10,0,1,9 June 2004
Valkyrie," Excellent film
","Valkyrie features Tom Cruise as star and producer of a true story about a group of German officers who made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler and launch a government coup over Germany in order to spare the country a more merciful surrender pact with the Allied forces. Despite a few setbacks, Valkyrie is an impressively well-crafted political thriller.Chief among these setbacks is Tom Cruise, himself, which is somewhat a disappointment because this man has taken a lot of beatings from the press and general public over the last couple of years and I'm usually one of his starch defenders. Cruise doesn't even attempt a German accent and doesn't really inject any personality into the role. It's ridiculously hard to suspend your disbelief and think you're watching anything other than some strange time travelling story of Tom Cruise playing himself inserted into 1944 Germany. But Cruise produced and bankrolled the film and stuck with it through several release date delays, so credit goes to him on that. Fortunately on the acting front, Cruise is surrounded by a really solid cast: Among others, Bill Nighy, Terrence Stamp (My Boss' Daughter, Get Smart), and Tom Wilkinson, fresh off his amazing performance in Michael Clayton last year. Wilkinson's character as a top general with loyalties to Hitler could have been someone you could have built an entire movie around. As in the X-Men series, director Bryan Singer doesn't just jump into the action but takes his time building suspense, even if the score is annoyingly over-dramatic at parts (it sounded like a horror film). If you're expecting an action film, you're bound to be disappointed. It's more of a backdoor political piece that reminded me a little bit of The Contender. For the first half of the film, Cruise is just going from Nazi official to Nazi official trying to find the right allies and gather signatures to enact his grandiose plan. The payoff is well-worth it, however. It's thought-provoking, tragic, and well-shot.",7,13,23,25 December 2008
Dodgeball," Riveting and Sharp Comedy
","Dodgeball is a riveting and sharp comedy about a sport we all stopped taking seriously after our last elementary school gym class.Vince Vaughn plays Peter LaFluer, owner of a rundown gym called Average Joe's. His membership total consists of just five, but nevertheless, the personable LaFluer is happy to be of service to his clients, even if they are all pathetically out of shape and a little off the norm. His gym is in financial trouble, however, and LaFluer is notified at the start of the film that he has thirty days to pay off its loan or it will be shut down. LaFluer's gym will be bought out by Globo, owned by the villainous White Goodman. Stiller pulls out the stops as Goodman, taking every opportunity to make himself dislike-able so that his demise at the film's end will be all the more sweeter.In need of a desperate solution, LaFluer and his clients sit down in his office and brainstorm. The solution comes from Gordon (Root) who reads in his magazine Obscure Sports Quarterly about an upcoming dodgeball tournament in which they could win the required money, so the ragtag bunch sets out to learn the sport and win the tournament. Their biggest obstacle is that in order to ensure Average Joe's shutdown, Goodman fields a team of bodybuilders to win the tournament and deny LaFluer the money, setting the stage for a David vs Goliath match up in the upcoming tournament.If there's one thing, aside from the satire, that there is to love about this movie, it's the quirky group of guys who comprise LaFluer's team. With the exception of Dwight (Williams), whose quirkiest attribute is his hatred of his previous job at the airport, the group is a very creative assemblage of underdogs. Vaughn plays the straight man, next to Stiller, his own team, and pretty much everyone else in the movie. You'd think that the love interest Christine Taylor as the lawyer, initially hired by Goodman to shut down Average Joe's but ends up joining the team out of disgust for the villain, but she turns out to have her own weird attributes.In a sense, Dodgeball is sort of a quasi-sports film because it centers around a sport that doesn't actually exist in terms of a spectator base, and uses that to poke fun at some of the sillier aspects of our present-day athletic culture. Be warned, this film is merciless, attacking everything from bodybuilders to ESPN to team uniforms. I particularly found it hilarious that the tournament was broadcast on ESPN 8, which probably is only a couple years away at this rate, and that one of the sports commentators (Arrested Development's Jason Bateman) knew absolutely nothing of what he was talking about.The movie gets caught up in all the satire, however, and towards the end drifts off into an absurd ending that really left a bad taste in my mouth. The ending threw so much of reality out the window, that it felt like a Mel Brooks film, which is a shame because up until the last couple minutes, the film did a terrific job at cracking out hilarious jokes within the context of a story. Looking back, though, the first couple of hours more than make up for the last couple of minutes, and I would have rather the movie aimed high and missed a couple notes, rather than being safe and not being as funny.",8,1,2,25 June 2005
The Island," Interesting but flawed
","Michael Bay usually achieves high grosses on films that are rejected by critics and most moviegoers of good taste. Richard Roeper called Bad Boys II the worst picture of the decade. Therefore, it was kind of odd that this 2005 film turned out to be a little bit the opposite: It completely bombed at the box office, making for Bay's lowest film to date, yet it might have been his most interesting film.'The Island' is a sci-fi film along the lines of Gattaca or I, Robot, set in some dystopian future, where the protagonist comes to the rescue of everything by transcending the limits of what the more rigidly stratified society places on him.The story revolves around a futuristic factory that promises to prolong the lives of its clients through cloning the clinets and using the clones' organs for transplants. The clones live in this isolated world with implanted memories and the idea that there is no life outside of this world. They're made to perform tasks that lead to the operation of the factory, so that saves labor costs. The only salvation for the clones is the belief that they will be taken to a paradise called the island if they're selected in a lottery, but in reality when a clone wins the lottery, that means the client needs an organ and the clone is killed. Ewan MaGregor and Scarlett Johannson play two clones who somehow find out about this outside world and are on the lam from the people who run the factory because it's supposedly some sort of worst-case scenario if the clones should get out. Being a Michael Bay film, this is also an action film, and a great one at that.While I'm a sucker for a good sci-fi film, and this is a fascinating concept, it seems like a flawed one as well. There seems to a complete ignorance of the fact that we've made a lot of progress in terms of harvesting replacement organs already that doesn't require building entire clones so there's a good chance a company like this could avoid all this morally gray area and the ensuing controversy. It seems as though this film was made from a script that was originally written well before the stem-cell controversy. Also, Sean Bean's character is not as morally significant to this universe as he believes he is because he can't make people as immortal as he says he can. He's just a glorified mad scientist organ harvester, and there's a point with many diseases beyond where a single organ replacement can save a life anyway.As for the film itself, while the action is great, considering the quality of the cast, the acting is a little subpar. Ewan MaGregor has the challenge of playing two people interacting in conversation (like Nicholas Cage did in Adaptation, a role that earned him an Oscar nomination) and I applaud him for that, but with the exception of Sean Bean, I don't really feel like anyone gave a remotely memorable performance. I came to greatly appreciate the visual look of this universe, and I think that sci-fi films are heavily dependent on visual feel.",5,0,1,11 March 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," an entirely solid follow-up
","Two summers ago, Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay teamed up for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, the best display of improvisational comedy on screen since Christopher Guest (Best in Show, A Mighty Wind) entered the scene. This summer, the pair re-teamed for a sort of quasi-sequel as evidenced by the colon and 'The Legend of' in the title. Will Ferrell stars as moderately dim-witted race car driver Ricky Bobby who differs from Anchorman's protagonist Ron Burgundy in that he is a more fully-fleshed out character. His need for speed on the track is guided by a void left by his race car driving dad's (Gary Cole's) abandonment. Along for the ride is the ever-so-versatile John C. Riley as perennial sidekick Cal Naughton Jr. who literally finishes second to him in every race. He suggests to his buddy maybe, just once, he can let him win just once to which Ricky Bobby replies, 'Well I see where you're coming from but if you win, how am I gonna win.' Talladega is more likable to its subject than a strict satire, because it firmly implants itself in the Nascar world and picks on its more absurd elements. In particular, the heavy emphasis on sponsorship in NASCAR takes a heavy beating with things like Ricky Bobby being contractually obligated to include Powerade in his grace. The ensemble of characters doesn't produce that same energy that Anchorman had, but Talladega Nights did have some priceless bits of humor and it works just as well, perhaps even better, as a feel-good movie.",8,42,72,29 August 2006
