The Lobster," One of the worst
",I like the idea of the background behind the film - you need to find a mate in 45 days or you are turned into an animal. Quite weird but watched it as it had Colin Farrell in it. How bad was that decision??!!! Just tedious and tedious on top of tedious! I recordeed it on my Freeview recorder so I could fast forward through some of it and I am glad that I did! I didn't miss anything of note. Avoid like the plague!!,1,2,4,26 January 2020
