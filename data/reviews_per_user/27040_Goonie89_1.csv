Gremlins," One of the best movies of the 80s
","Gremlins is a classic, one of the most brilliant movies of the 80s which includes The Goonies, The Karate Kid and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Gremlins focuses on a young man and his new unusual, yet cute pet, Gizmo the Mogwai. When he is given this gift by his father he is told he must obey by three rules which are, Do not feed them after midnight, Do not get them wet and keep them away from bright light. As this is a film all three rules are broken and mayhem is assured. From Joe Dante (Small Soldiers) and Steven Spielberg (Jaws) this is a fantastic film for the whole family and if you have not seen it you are a minority, all i can say is go and watch this now! You will not be disappointed.",10,0,2,2 March 2007
