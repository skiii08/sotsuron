The Blair Witch Project," If you didn't like it, you didn't understand the ending
","I have read the numerous reviews about the film.  Let me preface this by saying I loved this movie.  Very few films disturb me to the point where five days after viewing the movie I am still sleeping with the lights on.  I think that the negative reviews of this film may have missed the point.  One reviewer said the logic was flawed, that the campers should have just followed the stream to civilization.  The point was the campers couldn't leave the woods no matter what they tried.  They were directed by forces beyond their control.  Unfortunately the ending was cryptic and therefore I feel a lot of the audience did not understand what they saw.  If you listened carefully to the commentary of the people in the town, the ending was truly the best part of the film and what made me go to Walmart for a night light.",10,1,2,2 August 1999
Erin Brockovich," Entertaining if not substantial . . .
","It took the talent of Steven Soderbergh to pull off a successful legal drama in Hollywood.  Coppola failed with The Rainmaker and Steven Zaillian failed miserably with A Civil Action.  Erin Brockovich takes a similar plot outline and wins because it doesn't bore the audience with anti-climatic court room scenes.  Erin Brockovich pulls on all the right strings, manipulating the audience at will.  The audience is more than willing to go along for the ride as the cliches are hidden under great direction and inspired acting and the somewhat made for TV plot is given expert treatment from Soderbergh. Erin Brockovich will give Soderbergh the box office respect he deserved from Out of Sight and may land Julia her second Oscar nod.",8,1,1,20 March 2000
Unbreakable," A remarkable follow up to The Sixth Sense
","M. Night has proved that the success of The Sixth Sense was no fluke with is by far the best film of a sub-par Y2K.  Unbreakable is an unbelievably well told first chapter to a super-hero story, with Willis as the torn hero and Jackson as the mentor.  Willis, Jackson, and Robin Wright Penn have never been better.  Hauntingly poetic, Unbreakable builds slowly to its climax so when it finally arrives it hits you like a ton of bricks.  Beautifully shot and acted, Unbreakable becomes what all movies should strive to be . . . a film that once the credits roll, you want to watch it again, immediately. Words do this film no justice.",10,1,1,27 November 2000
Hostel," Hostel - A Review by Mandrake
","Great horror, at its core, has always been a mirror of the societal values during the time frame in which it was created. What scares us as a collective whole? Those films that tap into that phenomenon have always been the most successful and the most memorable. While not the only interpretations, Frankenstein can be seen as a warning of technology and science gone awry. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a clear allegory to fear of Communism. Godzilla teaches us to be wary of nuclear experimentation. Texas Chainsaw Massacre can be seen as a flower child awakening in a post-Vietnam US. Even the slasher flicks of the 80's are modern-day fairy tales exaggerating the dangers of sexual experimentation in a time of STDs and AIDS. What we have not seen as of yet is a reflection of our society in a post 9/11 world. One where the terror is in not knowing where the terror may be and one of ourselves being the monster, the aggressor, and the hated. Hostel may be the first to point in that direction.Hostel begins almost as a light-hearted, albeit X-rated, sister film to 2004's Eurotrip. We begin as our 'heroes' arrive in Amsterdam looking for ganja and sex not necessarily in that order. Paxton, the alpha male, and Josh, the sensitive one (think Favreau's character in Swingers) during their backpacking trip, have picked up Oli, a do-anything-anyone Icelander who comes along for the ride - so to speak. The trio jumps from dance club to hash bar to red light district leaving no pot unsmoked and no whore untapped. When they arrive at their Hostel after curfew, they are saved by a stranger who guides them to Eastern Europe with the promises of women who are as easy as they are beautiful. Then things, as they say, turn south.For the first 45 minutes, Hostel revels in its Cinemax After Dark qualities. Tanned breasts, trimmed pubic regions, and voluptuous rear-ends are all on display in various states of coitus however as the groups travels to Bratislava, they begin to encounter the creepiness and perversion that only a piece of the defunct Soviet empire can provide. One by one our protagonists begin to disappear after being lured away from the group by a nubile, young, topless women. As they soon learn, they have been duped. They find themselves on the bad end of a scheme that offers up live subjects that, for a price, can be tortured and killed in any manner in which your sick heart can dream.Utilizing my SAT skills - What the first 45 minutes are to breasts, the remaining 50 are to blood and gore. Hostel includes, but is not limited to, human drilling, Achilles slicing, unpleasant eyeball removal, chainsaw induced leg removal, and a savage beating resulting in a caved-in skull.While Hostel may not ever be shown in MoMA, it does present an interesting portrayal of American attitudes of ourselves and those from the outside. Our backpackers are the ugliest of the ugly Americans. Young and wealthy and with no concern for the consequences of their actions, they drink and fornicate their way across Europe and are despised by everyone outside of the young women who are impressed with foreign accents. Americans bring the highest price of all of the people you can torture for a price. Lastly, when the film turns toward revenge, the infliction of pain and torture to those that had hurt the Americans is just as violent and is handed out with an ask no questions, kill 'em all mentality.Is Hostel fine art? Probably not. Is Hostel great horror? It is close. The problem with Hostel is that is never really presents itself as scary. By the time the main characters get to the place of torture, the audience has been numbed by endless sex scenes and unlike those being tortured, we all know where they are going to end up. Basically outside of inventive ways to mutilate, Hostel offers nothing of a surprise and thus offers very little in the ways of scares (unless of course you are planning a trip to Europe anytime soon.) What we are left with are the elements of great horror; the reckless bravado, the moral depravity, buckets of blood, and the promise of an even gorier sequel.Hostel is 95 minutes long and stars the linebacker from Friday Night Lights and the guy who played young Jeff Daniels in D&Derer. It is rated R for countless breasts, a single beaver, and many, many other body parts that were not connected to other body parts. Mandrake grade: B+",8,3,5,17 January 2006
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Simply Brilliant
","The most disgusting, vile, horrific, racist, sacrilegious, and sexist movie of the year turns out to also be the funniest film anyone has done in a long long time.  Matt and Trey are the true geniuses.  This is the summer movie that Phantom Menace couldn't be -- one that lived up to the expectations. The humor is as foul and crude as everyone was hoping and then about ten times more and a Star Wars joke to boot.  And something that most probably won't touch upon, but this was a really well done musical.  I'm already starting the line for South Park Episode II.",9,0,0,30 June 1999
Hotel Rwanda," The worst good movie I have ever seen
","So I finally get around to seeing Hotel Rwanda. A friend and I had a long standing engagement to get out and see this film however the forces that control these things conspired against that happening and as all movies eventually do, even good ones starring Don Cheadle, Hotel Rwanda left the theater. My friend and I would have to view something else.As luck and fate would have it, Hollywood studios like to make as much money as they can on any given film and so they released Hotel Rwanda to DVD which allows viewing movies outside of the theater in your own home or place of convenience (forgive me if I am going to fast.) As I have a Netflix account and in that account I have a queue of movies, Hotel Rwanda was sent to me without me having to do anymore than point and/or click. Since it was sent, I felt obligated to watch - a fact that my wife hates by the way - while she has no problem stopping watching films already in progress, I, by some freak genetic mutation, must watch them to their painful end regardless of how long or asinine - much like the South Park episode where Cartman had to finish singing Come Sail Away whenever he heard the beginning of the song . . . but I digress.For those not familiar: Hotel Rwanda stars Don Cheadle as Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager who housed over a thousand Tutsis refugees during their struggle against the Hutu militia in Rwanda. The audience watches Paul's transformation from a man with style to a man with substance. (see the film - the quote makes more sense then.) So I watched IT - and here you are, dear reader, wondering how IT was. How do you think it was? Of course it was good, fine, Oscar nominated and all that. The story was heartfelt, Cheadle was stellar, impeccably shot. Heck, even the sound was good. And therein lies my problem - the film was all that I expected it to be and thus as I sit here thinking about it, I am terribly bored by it.How horrible! I am an unfeeling boob! He should be gutted and hung in a public square to remind little children on how not to live their lives! And to all of these things I would say yes, yes, and yes again. But that doesn't make Hotel Rwanda any better at entertaining me (a funny side note, the aforementioned friend, myself, and my wife all went to see Amistad one evening and were so bored by the slave trade film that we fell asleep which incensed our more social conscious audience members.) The problem is that Hotel Rwanda is so paint-by-the-numbers Oscar caliber that I wanted terribly for some Sofia Coppola-esquire Godfather 3 performance or some random death to shake me from my stupor. I took to the Internet to see if I was alone in my thoughts. Here are some quotes from the IMDb: larajane says: Watching with a friend, after ten minutes we had to pause the film because we decided we would be better served if we were more informed about what the basic facts of the conflict in Rwanda were. So to my shame, we had to read on the internet about what really happened, before we could continue. I say shame because we should have known, both of us were of an age when it happened to have taken more of an interest in world politics.and this from Julie-Gefter: i am frustrated because nothing i can type can represent how powerful this movie is or how much it moved me. i can't comment on the amazing acting or cinematography or directing because the movie transported me.and celiaricky loved the movie so much she 'ovated' the director for 10 minutes - the lucky scoundrel: Just saw the San Francisco premier last night and it isn't a dramatization - it's much more of a documentary -- Hotel is extremely factual. CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS FILM! INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE! The Director and the story's protagonist were at the screening to answer questions. We ovated him for almost 10 minutes.So there you have it - Hotel Rwanda was a good movie - a great movie by most accounts - that, I'd be willing to say if 'tweren't based on true facts would have been a nice little HBO original film. Cheadle is greatness - but watch Boogie Nights or Devil in a Blue Dress for a more impressive performance. And to all IMDb readers - I'm sorry I suck.Movie notes: Hotel Rwanda is 121 minutes long and rated PG-13 for brief strong language, Oscar worthy depictions of human atrocities, and disturbing images. Directed by Terry George who has brought you other true life moving experiences such as A Bright Shinning Lie and the second episode of season one of the District. It stars Don Cheadle who is good in everything he does, on and off camera.",7,1,2,4 November 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A film by which all others will be judged
","LOTR performs the one task that very few films can ever do . . . live up to the hype.  There is no need for me to say that LOTR is great, astounding, incredible, miraculous, awesome, etc., etc., etc.  These things have already been said by all who have seen it.  All I will say is that by Christmas 2003, the world will have a new holy movie trinity.  All films that follow will do so in Lord of the Rings shadow.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
Pitch Black," Predictable, formulaic, corny, sappy fun . . .
","I tried hard to hate Pitch Black and then when the film came to an end I almost had my reason.  Pitch Black will not find its place in the Sci-Fi/Horror Hall Of Frame.  However, Pitch Black is better than average Sci-Fi fare.  A sort of Road Warrior meets Alien theme where a not-so-good guy has to step up to bat and save the day.  The cinematograhpy and direction was excellent.  The aliens were genuinely creepy even and the premise of the film made for a great setting.  Vin Diesel is the star and hopefully the heir apparent to the title of action film box office champ that has been deserted by Arnold, Sly, Claude, and Steven.  I'll be first in line to get my night vision surgery.",6,0,0,19 February 2000
American Psycho," An intelligent look at the book that couldn't possibly be filmed. . .
","The problem with Ellis's book was one with the public.  People couldn't get past all of the violence and sex to see the underlying messages and themes of the book.  American Psycho, the novel, was a satire on the decadent lifestyle of the 80's and its trappings.  Of course the consequences were taken to extremes but its point was well made.  American Psycho, the movie, is a well done adaptation of the novel with only a few shortcomings.  Unlike the terrible movie, Less Than Zero, American Psycho stays true to the general fell and ideas of the novels. The sex and violence, while not completely removed, was not as explicit in the book.  Bale is superb as Patrick Bateman, although the Bateman that I envisioned from reading the novel was quite different and I suppose that was the main flaw of the film for me.  While reading the novel, Bateman was much more sinister to me, much more evil.  In the movie, Bateman seems to understand that what he really wants is to be accepted and to be seen as the best.  In the book, he was much more sure of himself.  All in all, I thought the movie was really well done, however it will face the same problems as the novel.  People won't be able to get past all of the violence and sex to see the underlying messages and themes of the film.  American Psycho is not for everyone, but it is a fine film.",7,0,0,15 April 2000
U-571," Something was missing . . .
",U-571's was a predictable action yarn with nothing much to note.  The story line did a great job of setting up its all too deliberate punches.  Bill Paxton basically outlined each one of Matthew McConaughey's future actions in the first 20 minutes of the film.  The action sequences did well to build some suspense but the computer graphics looked terrible.  The fact that the background was fake was painfully obvious.  The ending made it seem as if the screenwriters had run out of material or the director had run out of film.  All in all the film just left me wanting something better.,5,0,1,27 April 2000
Being John Malkovich," Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next Terry Gilliam
","Unfortunately most won't get a chance to see this film at the theater.  It will most likely only be a limited release unless it starts to make serious money, but for those in markets large enough, run to the theater.  This movie is the most original film of the year.  This premise, on initial description, sounds somewhat suspect.  A out of work puppeteer takes a filing job and finds a portal inside of John Malkovich's body where he can be John Malkovich for 15 minutes.  To explain anymore than that would be giving too much away.  The less known, the better.  The script is smart and funny and the inspired ensemble cast is brilliant.  The most winning aspect of this film is John Malkovich, for having the sense of humor to be cast as himself.  The film is probably not for all tastes, but if you are a fan of Terry Gilliam (Brazil, 12 Monkeys) you will love Being John Malkovich.",9,0,1,9 November 1999
Ocean's Eleven," A lifeless cash cow that could have been great
","Ocean's Eleven is a boring, smug, lifeless film.  The real shame is that it could have been oh so much better.  All the elements of a great film are there: intriguing premise, incredible cast, and an Oscar winning, stylistic director.  So what went wrong?  The premise really is never interesting as it seems.  The heist goes off so smoothly that the film never builds any tension whatsoever.  The bad guys are never as bad as they are made out to be and stealing from Vegas seems to be as easy as taking candy from a baby. The cast is all star, however they have all been better elsewhere or they aren't given much to do.  Clooney has played this role before in Out of Sight (a much better Soderberg film).  Brad Pitt is cool but he never adds much to the film other than a handsome set piece.  Andy Garcia is the much feared baddie who does nothing but turn the other cheek when his fortune is being robbed.  Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, and Elliot Gould are woefully misused as set dressing rather than full fledged characters.  The film would have been much better had it focused on these characters rather than Clooney and Pitt.  Julia Roberts' skeleton has a mere cameo role and really adds nothing to the picture.  That said, Ocean's Eleven is not a bad film.  It has a few moments of genuine cleverness and a couple of chuckles. But it could have been so much better.  Mamet's Heist, Richie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, and Soderberg's own Out of Sight are much better at the robbery game.  I really hope this is a minor stumble in the career of Soderberg and it isn't the Oscar curse that is overtaking him.  We shall see.",4,0,1,20 December 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Big dumb fun . . .
","The Mission Impossible series has picked up where the James Bond films have faltered (Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies, and The World Is Not Enough) by bringing back the basic good versus evil spy thriller.  MI2 doesn't muddle the plot with ridiculous one-liners or twenty year old love interests for the hero.  Granted MI2 is no Citizen Kane, however John Woo injects enough eye popping stunts and his usual brand of awe inspiring cinematography to make this film great eye candy.  The key is to just sit back and enjoy.",7,0,0,25 May 2000
The Hurricane," A great story of human triumph that is a little long in the tooth. . .
",The Hurricane is great story of human tragedy and triumph that presses all of the right buttons.  The acting is superb all around and Washington is certain of his second Oscar nomination.  Its only weakness is that is plays a little too long.  The story tends to stray off its main course at key times losing the momentum it has tried to build up.,7,0,1,17 January 2000
Any Given Sunday," Good sports movies are few and far between
","Sure it has all of the sports cliches but this is truly the best and most realistic football movie made.  Now that is not exactly saying much since the best Hollywood has to offer in this arena is The Program, Necessary Roughness, and The Waterboy.  Any Given Sunday is a good film regardless of its subject.  Some of the side plots fall to the wayside, however Oliver Stone does a fantastic job portraying men who would give anything for a few more moments of glory and displaying what it is like to be a god who has just discovered his own mortality.",7,0,1,29 December 1999
Final Destination," Just when you thought it was safe to listen to John Denver . . .
","Chalk this up to another really good premise ruined with an atrocious script and an unoriginal follow through.  What would have been interesting to find out is why Devon Sawa's character was let in on Death's design but this is not the flaw of this film.  With some hilarious death scenes and general overall creepy tone, Final Destination could have been the next Scream (which every horror film released since 1996 has been so desperately trying to be).  However, Final Destination does not have the same tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that Scream had.  The film takes itself way too seriously when it just should have had more fun with its good ideas.  Instead the audience is forced to listen to a ludicrous dialogue.  With that said, the film is actually a blast if expectations are held low.  The death scenes are extremely graphic and were usually unexpected.  If it weren't for the bus killing and the beheading, Final Destination would just be another House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, Disturbing Behavior, Urban Legend, etc., etc., etc.",5,0,1,24 March 2000
Gladiator," Hey Joey, Do you like Gladiator movies?
","Gladiator seemingly brings back the 'Epic' film (although the true epics included thousands of extras and larger than life productions and with CGI none of that extravagance is necessary).  Gladiator is by no means a great film.  The plot is paper thin, the story lines moves from point A to B with unfaltering linearity, and the end battle is somewhat of a disappointment. With that said, however, Gladiator was incredible to watch, making the audience watch in amazement as bodies are sliced and diced in the gory arena battles.  Russell Crowe is great (per usual) as Maximus, lending credibility to some of the more ridiculous dialogue and Joaquin Phoenix is superb (again per usual) as the tortured Commodus (unfortunate name).  Y2K has not produced the great films of 1999 (American Beauty, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich) yet, but Gladiator is a nice try.",7,0,0,25 May 2000
High Fidelity," A great movie from an incredible book . . .
","Cusack delivers a flawless adaptation of Nick Horby's great novel High Fidelity.  Every once in a while a movie comes along where you can totally identify with the characters.  These are my friends, music and movie snob-geeks with contempt for anything labeled 'popular'.  We are the guys who grew up watching too much television, listening to too much music, and watching too many movies.  We were tricked to think that life without misery was no life at all.  We were fooled into thinking all romances were story book and that all of life's problems can be wrapped up in thirty minutes or less.  Unfortunately, we set out to find relationships that resembled those we thought were normal and when these relationships went south, we spent way too much time obsessing and reliving them.  Thank God, we grew up and thank God for Nick Hornby reminding us of how great it was.",9,0,1,7 April 2000
