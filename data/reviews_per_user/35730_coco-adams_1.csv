Skyfall," Don't waste your time or money...please!
","This movie has so little to do with the original Bond series and Ian Fleming would not only roll over in his grave but come back to haunt the current franchise owners and screenwriters himself. This movie left everyone shocked at how BORING and UNAUTHENTIC this Bond flick could be. I left and went to bathroom and missed nothing at all, the plot has so many loose ends and clich√©s it sickened me. The writers have killed BOND as we know him and everything that makes James Bond the cool spy we grew to love. The only thing in the movie I liked was the house and the dogs. No gadgets, no Bond car, no Bond girl, no suspense, no twists, no action. A complete waste! I WILL NEVER SEE ANOTHER BOND RELEASE AGAIN! GO BUY THE OLD SERIES ON DVD OR SEE ANOTHER MOVIE!!!!",1,17,32,10 November 2012
