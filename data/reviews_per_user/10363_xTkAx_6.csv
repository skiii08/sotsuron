The New World," Wow!
","This would have been a totally awesome movie if the year was 1913, and they showed it in full color - it would have stood as the movie to beat for decades! But it's not. I saw this movie and i thought it was alright at the start, but it was hard to understand the dialouge and there was a lot of voice overs too, which didn't help too much. I don't know the real story of Pochoantas, and i guess if i did the movie would have made more sense. Anyway after watching about 1h 30m of this movie i got really bored and i started skipping a little bit ahead, and as it went on i started skipping a bit more ahead with increasing intervals until the movie was over. I compressed the last hour into about 20 minutes, and got most of the idea. But i tell you if this was a movie i went to see in the theater, i would have walked out for sure. This is like the first movie i've ever watched that i actually didn't want to watch anymore. I'm glad downloaded it instead and didn't pay to watch this movie. Hollywood films have been sucking a lot lately, which is why so many people are downloading flicks instead - they're tired of being ripped off! People want to have a good time in the theater, not pay 10 bucks to nap in an uncomfortable char, or get utterly bored to death. I'll give this movie another chance if they show it on cable or if I find the DVD out on the street. Hopefully it might be a better with the subtitles, and the ability to play 2x 3x speed.Bottom line: wait for cable/DVD.",1,2,9,5 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Horrible movie, horrible 'trilogy'
","I reviewed The Force Awakens (0/10), The Last Jedi (0/10) and now I'm reviewing the Rise of Skywalker. Here's the review: it's horrible, despicable, and disappointing just as i expected - 0 stars.This whole 'new star wars' 'saga' is heartless and empty ('''s are used because they're not really that, this convention is used throughout this review). The movie was built for one purpose: $$$. To achieve that it must destroy the lore George Lucas laid down, and it needs to end all ties to it so it can then try milk it for $$$. Contradicting all the lessons Star Wars (1977-1983) teaches us as it needs, because Disney has new ideologies to teach.Over the last few years my displeasure about what Disney did to the lore of Star Wars has grown as I've pondered - why? Or, why did this happen?I've come up with many possibilities, but only one i have found is most relevant is that it wasn't guided by George Lucas.The only way a Star Wars movie saga can work is the way George Lucas would tell it. That means there would be a reason to tell the story, with a good story to involve and invest the viewer, and lead them on an engaging journey.As a result, this entire 'Disney saga' is a complete nothing - it's null, void, aimless, empty, defunct, invalid, an error. It adds nothing to the lore of Star Wars, and attempts to destroy it, stealing from its previous successes every step of the way, while shamelessly raping it, and simultaneously robbing anyone who will watch this film atrocity.One of the saddest sights to see in almost the entirety of cinema itself over the last century. The love for money really brings things to ruin.History already knows this though, and so that means the Star Wars universe still open to George Lucas, while he lives, to write the story for 7, 8, & 9 and release it in film or as a story to guide it to be filmed. If not,history will agree that Star Wars ended a long time ago on Endor, in Return of the Jedi. No amount of whining that the non-George Lucas filmmaker did 'the best he could', or that Disney's 'star wars' is a 'good saga', will make this the official 7, 8, or 9 in the eyes of history. I hope that 7, 8, and 9 get remade properly, by George Lucas, because Disney's 'star wars' is trash.I was thinking of going to the Disney 'star wars' theme park when i heard it was being made, but this 'saga' turned me off, because Disney doesn't know how to handle Star Wars - it's too great for them to wield properly.All actors should be ashamed to have taken part in this. I know they did it for a pay cheque, and it shows. Thanks for destroying Star Wars, it made me lose any respect for your acting choices, i now know you will do anything for $$$.About some of these 'reviews'. Anyone rating this a 8, 9, or 10 likely is shilling to get you to spend your hard earned money on this garbage. This movie deserves no more than a 4 for CGI alone. For what it did to Star Wars, this 'movie' and 'trilogy' earns:0/10 - 'movie'
0/10 - 'trilogy'",Null,12,25,22 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," 0 stars - i can't believe how bad this was
","So bad. There is no story, it just follows people around, and has one barely passable as interesting scene in the last 25m (when the hippies pull up one dark night on the street). I think the high rating comes from nostalgia of people reminiscing about the 60s.DiCaprio, TV show guy, made some movies. was upset he was over the hill.. got in a western production did one good scene, went to Italy, found a wife, came back, torched a girl who broke into his house, meets the next door neighbour. The end.Pitt, drives DiCaprio around, washed up stunt guy, meets a cute hippy, fixes an antenna, has a few flashbacks, drives the cute hippy girl home, goes to Italy and comes back to live in the guest house. some hippies break in and (the best part of the movie) him and the dog take care of them for the most part, but he gets stabbed and goes to hospital. the end.This is really bad, i could write about the other characters but it's all stupid, and a complete waste of time.",Null,2,5,29 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Disney continues to beat the dead horse of star wars.
","The movie was garbage, but it was completely what i expected.After watching VII (when star wars was sacrificed on the altar of the almighty dollar, for the sake of greed - no less), it was clear to me that Star Wars was dead.I tried to look away from the truth, saying to myself 'I'll give VIII a chance, but not in the theater, and only when i find a stream online where i don't have to pay for it. It also has to resolve the problems of VII.' Well i found a stream like that, and watched it.I knew it was a long shot, but about 1 hour in i knew it had no hope. By the end it was clear Disney was just beating a dead horse. In fact, since the death of star wars in VII (also by Disney), when i started to analyze what really killed the star wars movies, followed by the lackluster rogue one, and now this, the answer is shockingly simple. The story came from the mind of George Lucas, so if George Lucas isn't a part of it, Star Wars is dead.I just saw the trailer for Solo: a star wars story today too. It has no hope either, and appears dead on arrival, so i expect it to get the score the last jedi received:0/10",Null,8,10,10 April 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Horrific! By all means: avoid.
","During the opening few minutes of this movie, it looked like reviewers were right: this was going to be a fantastic movie! But by the 1/2 way mark, it was apparent all the positive reviews were bogus hype.I spent the last few days trying to figure out why it was so disappointing. I was a huge fan of Star Wars, with a lot of hope that this would be a good movie, and a lot of faith in the lead-up reviews. However, since I watched this movie, it felt like Star Wars is now dead, Hollywood is also dead, and movie making is now about scamming people out of their money with lies about how good something is.It was a horrific mess of a movie, and utterly disappointing. It doesn't even fit into the star wars universe a all. If you read the high rated 1-2 star reviews here on IMDb, you will get the picture of how this movie REALLY is.My recommendations: 1)Save your time, and avoid. 2)Save your money, and watch it for free.Thanks for reading!P.S.To,George Lucas: The worst thing you could have done was sell the rights of your story to Disney.Disney: You ruined Star Wars.JJ Abrams: You ruined Star Trek, now Star Wars; you're a terrible director/producer! Enjoy the ego stroking over the 'greatness' of this movie, but don't be fooled; clover field is your only decent creation to date.Carrie / Mark / Harrison: It was nice seeing you again, but you should have said 'no' until a higher standard was met. This was a time where you actually held the reigns. But now it is history and you've handed them over.Everyone else: Thanks for taking part in killing Star Wars. May it be remembered as such, always.",Null,60,91,31 December 2015
The Simpsons Movie," This really is terrible
","My buddy and i watched this movie. I'm not a fan of the Simpsons, and i have only watched about 6-7 full shows. But if anything is for sure, this movie is utterly terrible. It's sexist, profane, foolish, and a downright waste of time.One part that stuck out, aside from the cartoon pee-pee, was a TV channel scroll advertisement, which popped up on the bottom of the screen, that made it quite clear of how they advertise in movies now. I assume it was made to get someone laughing, and if someone was laughing at that, it's kind of a shame. Because i imagine that's what the higher ups in the American ideal were trying to do, as they try to drop the blindfold of their deluded ways over the American people. If anyone argues.. someone could say 'Well that's normal!' or 'but they were just stating the truth!' or some other deluded line except for, 'This means we're in trouble!'.. Anyhow the point i decided to not watch this movie anymore was shortly after Mr and Mrs Simpson were going to go to bed together, all these fuzzy little creatures burst in the door of the cabin and tried to make it all love-like. I turned to my friend and and remarked 'this is the most ridiculous thing i have ever seen'. And no i wasn't laughing one single bit. Needless to say it just kept getting stupider and stupider after that.The lame jokes, which in fact numbered in the thousands if not hundreds, just became too much to bear. It was almost like the director was trying to put every joke possible into this movie, and not caring if only a few succeeded.I am glad i downloaded this movie, i would not recommend this movie to anyone at all, least of all a child. This is an adult film, made for those who love the American way and all the foolishness associated with it, who love the gossip and rumor mills and who think this junk can bring positive political change. If that's not you, don't watch it.In fact, i suggest to anyone who wants to watch this movie, join in with what young Mr. Simpson and i did.... and download this movie - for free.",1,5,16,6 August 2007
